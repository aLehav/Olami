After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“So, are you a lesbian?”
I’ve been asked this countless times. The first time was when I was 15, and the most recent time was just a few weeks ago. I have a complicated relationship with the term “lesbian,” and whenever I get asked this question, my response varies—ranging from “kinda” to “not really” to a flat-out “no.” I’ve tried out the term a few times and it doesn’t seem to fit me well, so I tend to avoid it when expressing my own identity. But, reflecting on this terminology made me think about about the ways we use language to identify ourselves.Language can be useful in naming experiences. For example, if someone tells me they’re a lesbian, I immediately understand that they are a woman who is attracted to other women. Obviously, there’s more to that person than just their identity as a lesbian, but that seven-letter-word has given them a quick way to convey a general sense of one part of their experiences. Language can also be useful in creating communities. If this person who self-identifies as a lesbian finds another person who also self-identifies as a lesbian, their shared usage of the term represents some shared identity that they now have the language to discuss. They can access resources and join social groups geared toward lesbians. Language can be incredibly useful and positive for some. But, language can also be tricky. Some LGBTQ+ people identify strongly with a specific term (such as bi or trans or gay), while others may choose to not label themselves. This could be because they don’t want to feel boxed in, or because they haven’t found a term that they feel best represents their identity and experiences. Some people may not have a word to describe what they are, but they know what they’re not. In my own experience, I’ve come out many times as “not straight,” and sometimes I’ll explain further, and other times I won’t. Language can also be complicated by the fact that identity can be fluid, so a person’s gender or sexual orientation may change over time, across a wide spectrum. In a broader context, I’m a very different person than I was five years ago, and there are some aspects of my life that were essential when I was 14 that no longer apply to my present life. That doesn’t mean that I was lying before or that I’m confused now; it just means that I’ve evolved over time, and parts of my identity may have shifted. The same goes for gender and sexual orientation. While some people’s gender and sexuality are constant, for others, gender and sexuality can change. No one should feel chained to identifying a certain way just because they’ve “always” identified that way. So what does all this mean for all of us?
Take people at their word. Whatever they say their gender or sexual orientation is, believe them. Even if you think they’re confused. Even if you think they’re queer and just haven’t come around to it yet. Even if you think they’re “lying” about their gender (newsflash: they’re not). Even if they’ve never dated anyone before. Even if they’ve only dated people of one gender. Even if they wear makeup everyday. Even if they never wear makeup. Even if you think you have a reason—any reason—that you think is valid. It can be scary enough to vocalize any identity, so don’t make it any more difficult by questioning them. Don’t pry into why people identify a certain way. Many people assume that just because someone is not cisgender and heterosexual, that means they need to justify or explain their identity. LGBTQ+ people do not owe the world any justifications or explanations. We are who we are, and that’s more than enough.Don’t assume anyone’s pronouns. If someone tells you their pronouns, use those. If not, use the gender-neutral they/them/theirs, or just refer to them by name. There might also be a time when you notice someone using different pronouns than you heard them use before; go along with it. Perhaps this person now identifies more strongly with this new set of pronouns. Some people use different pronouns in different situations or spaces, and this could be for a number of reasons—including safety. You should simply respect and use the pronouns they tell you to use. It’s incredibly important to allow people the agency and space to figure out who they are and label, or not label, themselves as they please. As tempting as it is to make assumptions about other people or provide suggestions for labels, remember that identity and the language surrounding it is personal and specific to each individual.
For too long, the voices of LGBTQ+ people have been drowned out by others telling us how we should be, act, and live. We reclaim a bit of ourselves and our power when we can choose the language the best fits our identities and experiences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, hundreds of protesters marched across Harvard’s campus to demand that the University divest  from the Baupost Group, a hedge fund with holdings of Puerto Rico’s debt. We appreciate the protesters' sympathy for Puerto Rico’s plight: After two Category 5 hurricanes struck the island in September, many Puerto Ricans lost water and electricity, and some Harvard students were left unable to contact their families. Since then, the island's recovery has been exceedingly slow.
Nevertheless, though we respect the protesters’ right to protest, we are not supportive of their demands for divestment. We remain convinced, as we have reiterated many times in the past, that the strategy of divestment is not the answer.
Many of our editorials concerning divestment have been written in response to Divest Harvard's efforts to urge the University to divest its endowment from companies involved in coal and fossil fuels. At that time, proponents of divestment aimed to combat anthropogenic climate change, an issue on which science is unequivocal.
Now, we consider debt. The economics that undergird arguments about divestment from Baupost are undoubtedly more nuanced, and it is questionable how the protesters'  demands for Harvard to “divest from hate” by divesting from the Baupost Group will help Puerto Rico. Indeed, before the hurricanes, these loans could very well have helped the island by providing the capital that enabled the government to function.
It is also important to recognize that, though the protesters refer to those at Baupost as “vultures,” a spokesperson for the group said that it has not purchased more bonds since the hurricane.
Were Harvard to convince Baupost to sell its holdings of Puerto Rican debt, other investors—presumably understanding that Harvard’s decision was motivated by political, and not financial, reasons—would likely buy the debt. This is one of the most troubling flaws of divestment, and a concern with the strategy that we have expressed previously. Any potential sale would have no effect on the amount owed by Puerto Rico to its creditors.
If the Baupost Group and other creditors were to instead forgive Puerto Rico’s debt, as President Donald Trump suggested, the effects would be uncertain, as economists remain divided on the issue. Some argue the short-term relief is needed, while others are concerned with long-term problems on the island and the fact that many owners of the debt are American pension funds and individual Puerto Ricans.
Nevertheless, we recognize that, in the future, Puerto Rico—and other developing economies—will surely need new credit to finance further expansion. It is probable that Harvard, given the size of its endowment, has investments in funds that hope to lend money to finance such expansions. These loans could provide much-needed capital to facilitate the growth of developing economies. Thus, we hope Harvard does not take these protests as a sign it should cease investments that loan to developing economies for fear that seeking repayment will trigger protests.
Instead of divestment, there are steps the University can and should take to provide tangible support for the island. We encourage Harvard to consider following the lead of schools like the University of Chicago and University of California, Davis, which have invited students from Puerto Rican universities to apply to enroll for a limited period of time. Harvard should also consider intensifying efforts to encourage Puerto Rican students to apply to the University and direct research in a manner that would assist the island in its recovery. Furthermore, the University must ensure that its own Puerto Rican students are cared for.
Puerto Ricans are our fellow citizens, and they deserve our full support in their recovery. Such support, however, should take the form of real, tangible action. Protesting Harvard for its endowment’s investments in a hedge fund that owns Puerto Rican debt is, at best, unlikely to help. At worst, it harms the long-term future of the island.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past semester, Economics and Computer Science again ranked as the most popular concentrations at Harvard College. No surprise here. After all, these two concentrations are often seen as having the most direct applicability to lucrative jobs on Wall Street or Silicon Valley. Who could blame students for wanting to get a quick return on the four-year investment that is an undergraduate education at Harvard?
Considering this, it makes sense for students to pigeonhole themselves and take classes that will prove handy after graduation. I‘m sure you’ve heard as much as I have from classmates looking to “take an easy class and knock out a Gen Ed requirement,” so they can begin taking “what’s actually useful.”
When I hear such remarks, I’m reminded of the students I spoke to halfway around the world—in China—where I recently toured with Glee Club Lite to visit a dozen universities and high schools. Students there speak of an education system that emphasizes strict rigidity, learning for the sake of taking tests, and specializing very early in their lives.
Chinese students are placed into universities by the scores they receive on the Gaokao, the country’s infamously challenging college admissions exam. It is a grueling ordeal where a single point could mean the difference between admission and rejection from universities. Students select a major before the exam’s results even come out, and they are admitted based on the scores they receive in relevant fields on the exam.
For example, an incoming college freshman may commit to majoring in mechanical engineering at a certain university without actually having ever taken a course in that field, or even a single course at that university. Students are compelled to typecast themselves into a major because they were admitted to specialize in that field—a sensible expectation, as all of China’s best universities are under the purview of the country’s government and are designed to allocate professionals to each industry of the Chinese economy.
As a result, Chinese students will never enjoy the opportunity to “shop” classes in whatever field they choose, or to enroll in courses that simply interest them. Most will never be able to take an actual college class before declaring their major, let alone be exposed to a liberal arts education. They will, however, take courses and study subjects that are immediately and directly applicable to the jobs they take upon graduating. As a result, they will have very little room to discover their true passions.
Their education is, at the end of the day, a means to an end. In elementary, middle, and high school, students prepare to take the all-important Gaokao. And in college, they study to prepare themselves to obtain a job after graduation. Education, by and large, is not a way to train students in deep and critical thinking, but rather a shortcut to a lucrative job after graduation.
Their system could not be more different than the one we have at Harvard. We are encouraged to discover our genuine interests before declaring our concentration, and we are challenged to take classes that are completely unrelated to our field of study.
We, as Harvard students, should not waste this valuable opportunity to find what we actually love to do, for that is a privilege many college students elsewhere will never enjoy. Our time here marks a chance for us to discover our comparative advantage, if you will—the field or area where we can make the greatest impact. We have the freedom and the power to shape our lives around what we do best and what we truly enjoy.
So next time, when you choose classes, go for a class in philosophy, or history, or chemistry. It may very well spark something that changes your intellectual trajectory. And while such classes may not help us to find the most immediately lucrative job out of college, they will certainly pay dividends in the long run. They will offer us new perspectives on the world and make us more inquisitive and more powerful thinkers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sally C. Donahue, director of financial aid at the College and a senior admissions officer, will retire in August after more than 18 years in her position.
Donahue, who held various posts at the University over the course of 36 years, oversaw the launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative—a financial aid program aimed at making the College more affordable for low- and middle-income students. The initiative provides more than half of College students with financial aid and covers full tuition for 20 percent of families.
William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the dean of admissions and financial aid, announced Donahue’s retirement in an email addressed to his colleagues on Jan. 17.
“Sally’s remarkable contributions will always be valued and remembered, and her kindness, hard work, commitment, and dedication are worthy of great admiration,” Fitzsimmons wrote. “She will be deeply missed.”
He detailed her work at the University and praised her accomplishments from throughout her tenure. “She has made a significant difference in the lives of countless students and their families during her career,” Fitzsimmons wrote.
Prior to directing the financial aid program at the College, Donahue oversaw financial aid at the Kennedy School and Harvard Law School. She has chaired several regional and national financial aid committees, and Fitzsimmons described her as “a national leader of the financial aid profession.”
In an email after the announcement to some of her colleagues at other universities, Donahue wrote she was deeply grateful for her time at Harvard and said that the work she began in the Financial Aid Office remains unfinished.
“This is a remarkably important profession—having the ability to change lives is so meaningful and advocating for the continuing diversification of our student bodies across all categories has been rewarding work,” Donahue wrote. “There is, of course, so much more to be done.”
She added that she would remain working part-time to continue with her admissions responsibilities and to fundraise for the College’s financial aid program. Donahue also solicited candidates for her soon-to-be vacant position in the email, asking colleagues for recommendations for those who might succeed her in a position she described simply as “a great job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four DACA recipients at the Medical School wrote an open letter last week calling on the nation to protect its undocumented students, as lawmakers are struggling to reach an immigration deal.
The four Medical School students—Anthony Tucker-Bartley, Alma J. Oñate Munoz, Blanca E. Morales Temich, and Dalia G. Larios Chavez—explained how the uncertainty surrounding the program affects them and other students across the country in a piece for WBUR addressed to their “fellow Americans.”
“Without DACA, there is no possibility of continuing the natural progression of medical training,” the letter reads. “DACA students will not be the only Americans to suffer from this. The communities we hope to serve will also be affected: your neighbors, your family, your friends, and even you.”
Morales Temich said she and her co-authors wanted to make the point that American society stands to benefit from allowing DACA recipients to live and work in the United States.
“At its core, the immigration issue is the ability for people to be fully integrated into society and to make meaningful contributions,” she said.
In the letter, the students wrote about the potential for thousands of DACA recipients to “diversify the physician pool” by entering the medical workforce.
President Donald Trump announced in September he would end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that provided legal protections to undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. In recent weeks, enshrining these protections into law has become a flashpoint of debate on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers face deadlines for reaching a deal on the issue.
Since September, the Medical School students have met with multiple Harvard administrators— including George Q. Daley ’82, dean of the Medical School, and Fidencio Saldaña, the school’s dean of students—to discuss their status and the University’s position toward DACA. Saldana wrote in an email the school is “proud” of its undocumented students.
“It is vitally important that we find a permanent solution that will enable them to continue their medical training and enrich our society as physicians,” Saldaña wrote.
The students who wrote the letter said the medical training process presents challenges for undocumented students at multiple stages. They specifically named residency—a period of in-hospital training after medical school—as difficult to navigate.
“What makes the residency process difficult is that, essentially, it’s like a hiring process,” Larios Chavez said. Hospitals expect work permits or Social Security numbers from prospective residents, which DACA students would not be able to provide if they lose their DACA status.
It is also challenging for DACA recipients to finance their medical educations. Even with DACA in place, federal financial aid is unavailable to undocumented students. The Medical School allows undocumented students to apply for private scholarships and loans through their standard financial aid application process.
Although these four students say they believe they are the only DACA recipients at the Medical School, they are joined by almost 100 other medical students in the United States, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Oñate Munoz said the authors of the letter were concerned about these students as well.
“We thought that it would be important to advocate, and to in many ways use the Harvard name to speak out,” she said.
For the most part, the authors of the letter said they were satisfied with the support they have received from the Medical School students, faculty, and administration.
“I feel we’ve received a lot of support, and the staff has really checked in with us,” Larios Chavez said. Harvard has provided legal resources to students across the University who might be affected by DACA’s repeal, including the students at the Medical School.
Larios also said that University President Drew G. Faust contacted her to signal her support after the letter was published by WBUR.
Faust has long advocated for DACA’s continuation. When President Trump initially announced his intent to end the program last year, Faust denounced the decision as “cruel.” Earlier this month, she urged Congress to pass legislation protecting DACA recipients.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Economics 10B: “Principles of Economics” topped the charts in undergraduate enrollment for the fifth consecutive spring semester, boasting 585 students as of Monday morning, according to the Registrar’s office of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
But enrollment in Economics 10B falls short of its fall semester counterpart, Economics 10A: “Principles of Economics,” by 42 undergraduates. Still, the introductory macroeconomics course, taught by Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, currently enrolls 200 more students than the next most popular course on campus.
In keeping with previous trends, Michael I. Parzen’s Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics” had the second largest undergraduate enrollment at 356 College students. Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt,” was the third largest course, in terms of College enrollment, with 350 undergraduates.
Christopher L. Foote, who teaches Economics 1010b: “Intermediate Macroeconomics,” the fourth most popular course at the College with 340 undergraduates, said he wishes more people continued with economics past the flagship Ec 10.
“A lot of things we learn in Ec 1010 are really helpful to understanding economic debates today, and economic issues today,” Foote said.
Foote added that Harvard undergraduates who wish to be educated citizens of the world would do well to get an intermediate grounding in economics.
“I believe the stuff we learn in intermediate macro is incredibly important and my only regret is that we don’t have even more students in the class,” he said.
Fiery A. Cushman ’03 , the course head of Psychology 15: “Social Psychology," said the class—tied for the fifth largest College course with 338 undergraduates—is always popular because it is applicable to every person’s life.
“It’s been a popular course for decades—social psych is just a really awesome topic,” Cushman said. “For me, it’s hard to ask for an easier or more rewarding teaching assignment.”
Cushman, who has been teaching the class at Harvard since 2014, said the lecture titles alone show how applicable the course is in the lives of students.
“Stereotype and prejudice, morality, attraction in romantic relationships, willpower,” he listed. “We’re trying to understand everyday human behavior and make sense out of it. It’s hard to know what could possibly be more relevant.”
Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution” also has 338 students enrolled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard’s search for its next president stretches into its ninth month, a faculty committee tasked with advising the search has yet to publicly announce its plans—and several committee members remain tight-lipped about the group’s role in the process.
Committee chair Robin E. Kelsey, the dean of arts and humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, did not reply to repeated requests for comment over the past month.
In an email Thursday, committee member Hopi E. Hoekstra also declined to comment on the committee’s progress.
“I apologize but I don't have any information to share with you,” Hoekstra wrote.
Committee member Alison J. Simmons said she was “not at liberty to say anything” about the search.
The 13-member faculty advisory committee first formed in August 2017. It is tasked with helping guide the 15-member search committee seeking the successor to University President Drew G. Faust, who announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018. The search committee comprises all 12 members of the Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers.
The advisory committee includes professors from all of Harvard’s schools except for the School of Dental Medicine.
In October, several chairs of social science departments confirmed that two faculty committee members met with department chairs in the division to garner their input on preferred traits for the next president. The faculty committee itself did not comment on the meeting.
In November, Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said in an interview with The Crimson that he had not yet met with the advisory committee.
By contrast, a similar search advisory body composed of University students disclosed in an email last week that they had met with members of the search committee “in person.” The student committee will eventually present a report summarizing their findings to the next president, according to committee members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences reported high satisfaction with teaching and concerns about advising, grading, and educational resources in a student life survey, according to the results published earlier this month.
The survey, which asked graduate students about advising, teaching, and student community building, is one of three rotating questionnaires that GSAS administrators distribute to students each fall. The other two surveys aim to collect data on academic life, professional concerns, departmental program requirements, child care, and the cost of education.
Per the GSAS report on the survey, roughly half of graduate students said that they were involved in community activities at Dudley House, the GSAS student center.
David-Maximilian “Max”  Vani, the GSAS representative on the Harvard Graduate Council, said he thinks the School has been successful in allocating resources towards community building among graduate students.
“GSAS is doing well in terms of connecting students through a variety of school-sponsored social activities,” Vani said. “Residence halls are open to residents from several other Harvard graduate schools, as well as to a large cohort of international visiting students, all of which encourages social interaction.”
Although nearly 90 percent of graduate students said they were very satisfied with their teaching experience, some mentioned concerns about the overemphasis on grading for undergraduates. Nearly 10 percent of graduate students also reported concerns about their primary advisor.
Garth O. McCavana, GSAS dean for student affairs, wrote in a emailed statement that he hopes some concerns graduate students brought up in the survey will be remedied by the hiring of two new staff members, Caysie A. Carter and Anna Fisher-Pinkert, assistant director of student affairs and a digital communications manager, respectively.
“We were particularly pleased to see high satisfaction with teaching, with nearly 90% of respondents reporting a good or excellent overall teaching experience,” McCavana wrote. “For respondents who expressed dissatisfaction with their experience, GSAS wants to ensure that they are aware of the many resources available to our students.”
“We are already seeing progress,” McCavana added.

When seeking a leader, Harvard often looks to Harvard.
Since the University’s founding in 1636, Harvard has seen 28 presidents. Of these, 19—more than 60 percent—held a professional role at the University before taking their seat in the president’s centuries-old Massachusetts Hall office.
Harvard’s predilection for internal presidents has only increased in the last 100 years. Since the early 1900s, all but one University president held an administrative or faculty position at the school prior to assuming the top job. The one president who did not—Nathan M. Pusey ’28—sported multiple degrees from Harvard. In the past, University presidential search committees sometimes passed over frontrunners for their lack of Harvard credentials.
Joan M. Hutchins ’61, a former president of the Board of Overseers, said she is well aware Harvard prefers its own. She gave a blunt assessment of the pattern.
“Harvard can be a little full of itself,” she said.
Now, as the University enters the final phase of its search for the 29th president, the current presidential search committee faces a choice: Stick with the status quo and choose someone from within, or break from precedent by looking outside Harvard’s gates.
The Crimson reported in Dec. 2017 that the search committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation as well as three Overseers—had narrowed its candidate pool to a shortlist of under 20 names. Alumni, donors, and professors say multiple individuals currently employed by Harvard are likely on this list, including Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Experts and Harvard affiliates say these internal candidates—if chosen for the job—would bring a deep knowledge of Harvard unavailable to those outside the University.
In particular, prominent alumni and analysts argue internal candidates’ familiarity with Harvard affords them two main advantages: internal candidates can transition more easily into one of the most demanding roles in higher education and, once in office, can more quickly cultivate donor relationships vital to keeping the University financially solvent.
The job of president demands a quick adjustment. University President Drew G. Faust began appointing staff months before she was officially handed Harvard's keys and charter. In one example, she named Michael D. Smith to be the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences weeks before she set foot in her office. 
In a Nov. 2017 interview, Faust—who plans to step down in June 2018—said she expects her successor will begin calling the shots months before the official transition.
"Would I expect the person to start making decisions right away on July 1st? They better!" she said.
Search experts and high-level administrators—both at Harvard and at other schools—say having prior experience at a school makes the rapid-fire presidential transition smoother.
Search expert Paula B. Fazli ’85, founding partner of higher education search firm Sage Search Partners, said internal candidates have a leg up when it comes to understanding campus culture.
“They could probably transition into the presidency a little more easily because they've known the institutional culture, the way decisions are made, the institutional politics,” Fazli said. “There wouldn't be as big of a learning curve in terms of institutional culture.”
Economics professor Eric S. Maskin ’72, who has taught at the University for close to four decades, said he thinks Harvard’s culture is particularly difficult to penetrate. Long-running traditions and 12 independent schools make Harvard a “complicated place,” Maskin said.
He added he thinks an internal candidate would better understand the University’s complexity.
“It takes time to learn about those complications and someone who has already been here for a while has a head start,” Maskin said.
At a day-to-day level—whether planning long-term initiatives or simply scheduling meetings—an internal candidate would also benefit from pre-existing relationships with faculty and staff, according to former Stanford Provost John W. Etchemendy.
Etchemendy, who served as the vice chair of Stanford’s 1998 presidential committee, was a contender in Harvard’s last presidential search.
“I think an internal candidate always has the advantage of knowing the institution and knowing the players,” Etchemendy said. “That’s very important because you want to know who to listen to and who not to listen to.”
Ted Webb, leader of executive search firm Ford Webb Associates, said an internal candidate can apply their knowledge of the University to seek out and appoint more capable leadership.
“They have that history, they have those relationships and reinvent themselves in the best sense and bring leadership into an organization that they know,” Webb said.
Harvard’s next president will need to fill at least one major administrative position soon after accepting the job. Tamara E. Rogers ’74, University vice president of alumni affairs and development, who oversaw the University's record-breaking capital campaign, also announced she will leave Harvard this year.
Nohria may have an advantage over other presidential possibles in this category. He is known for his ability to identify strong candidates for high-profile administrative roles, according to longtime Business School lecturer and friend Scott A. Snook.
“One of his greatest skills is selecting talent,” Snook said. “He has this unique ability to see gifts in people and then help them and is one of the best mentors on the faculty.”
As the search committee seeks to make a final pick in coming weeks, members will likely begin interviewing front-runners in intimate settings: spending hours behind closed doors and chatting over meals, according to Etchemendy.
Etchemendy said these kinds of evaluations serve a particular purpose—a tactic meant to test how the candidate behaves “socially,” an important barometer for how a contender might interact with top donors in social situations.
One of the most important items on the University president’s fundraising agenda involves working directly with Harvard’s biggest donors to coordinate gifts that satisfy benefactors and fit specific needs across campus. Some donors and higher education search experts have said this ability to fundraise will be key over the next few years.
Harvard relies heavily on fundraising to boost its income, according to New York University Finance Professor David L. Yermack ’85. Yermack said this dependence means the next president must be “very good at working with alumni,” a task likely eased for an internal candidate.
“Whoever becomes the new president is going to spend most of their time raising money and cultivating donor relationships,” Yermack said.
Donors may be more receptive to requests for funding when the ask comes from someone familiar with Harvard—even more so when it comes from a former classmate, or a former seatmate during lecture or section.
Senior fellow of the Corporation, William F. Lee ’72, who chairs the search committee, said the next president’s ability to fundraise and support the University’s $37.1 billion endowment will be a critical consideration in the search in a June 2017 interview with the Harvard Gazette.
Over the course of her tenure, Faust spent a significant amount of time raising money for the capital campaign, meeting with alumni around the world to solicit donations. The campaign, which had raised $8 billion as of June 2017, is set to end in fewer than six months, likely leaving Harvard vulnerable to a future of poor endowment returns and increased federal taxation. 
A number of alumni who said they support Nohria’s candidacy have cited his knowledge of the University and capacity to fundraise as reasons he would make a good Harvard president. Nohria helped secure John A. Paulson’s $400 million gift to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 2015, marking the largest gift in University history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Seventeen students declared their candidacies for the Undergraduate Council in this spring’s midterm elections, vying for ten open seats across nine upperclassman Houses, according to UC Election Commission chair Jubin Gorji ’21.
The campaigning and voting period will take place between Jan. 30 and Feb. 1. Open seats in the midterm elections result from representatives deciding to leave the Council after only one semester of their year-long terms or from the end of terms for members of the Executive Board.
Additionally, the election of UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 in November left open seats in Cabot and Mather Houses, respectively.
This year’s midterm election will be the first to utilize the UC’s new election software. The Council launched a new voting system this month after some students said they were unable to submit ballots during last November’s presidential election.
The seventeen declared candidates mark a continued decline in the number of students opting to run in UC midterm elections. Last year, 27 students declared their candidacy for the spring, compared to 35 the spring before.
Four Houses—Adams, Dudley, Dunster, and Leverett —will have uncontested elections, while competitive races will occur in Cabot, Currier, Mather, Pforzheimer, and Quincy Houses. There are two open seats in Dunster this cycle. There are no open seats in any freshman yard, the first time since 2015.
Twelve of the 17 students running for office are sophomores, while three are juniors, and two are seniors.
Only two of the candidates—Student Relations Committee Chair Victor C. Agbafe ’19 and former UC Secretary Ruiqi He ’19—are running for re-election. Agbafe previously ran an unsuccessful bid for the UC presidency in last November’s election.
The following students have declared their candidacies for the UC:
Adams House
K. Yu-Mi Kim ’20
Cabot House
Ashish Dahal ’20
Maureen Tang ’20
Currier House
Michael A. Shadpour ’20

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nadeem A. Mazen, a former Cambridge City councillor, announced his withdrawal from the race to replace retiring representative Niki D. Tsongas of Massachusetts’s third congressional district on Sunday.
Mazen is a Muslim-American activist and MIT graduate who served two terms on the Cambridge City Council following his elections in 2013 and 2015. Mazen did not seek reelection in the 2017 City Council race, instead vying for the national stage.
Though he cited personal health concerns as a determining factor in his decision to end his campaign, he said his primary reason for withdrawing from the race was campaign financing.
“It's a learning experience for me, and I need to learn how to raise the big dollars for congressional campaigns,” Mazen said.
Several candidates are vying for the Democratic nomination in the district that includes Lowell, Mass. Daniel A. Koh ’07, former chief of staff to the mayor of Boston, Barbara A. L’Italien, a state senator, and Stephen J. Kerrigan, the 2014 Democratic nominee for Mass. lieutenant governor, are all contenders in the crowded field.
“When you run for a congressional race and you see someone raising $1.6 million in big corporate money, or you see someone who was Obama’s campaign finance director in 2012 and has nationally raised half a million dollars overnight, that signals to me that there's a big gulf between running a movement, and getting people engaged on the local and state level, and running a strong congressional campaign,” Mazen said.
Mazen said that other candidates had more established financial networks, an advantage in a busy race.
“I don't have those networks and I wouldn't want to have fundraising success be based on wealthy business contacts like others have,” Mazen said. “I would want that to be based on a movement of people who want to see a new type of legislator.”
Now, Mazen, a tech-based entrepreneur, is turning all his attention to his new app Outvote.
“It is the dream I’ve had for a long time of supporting others through the importance of voter engagement,” he said.
The app, which aims to generate enthusiasm and support for candidates across the country, will be debuting in the 2018 elections, according to Mazen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allston residents brainstormed ways to reduce traffic congestion on a key street near Harvard-owned land in the neighborhood during a meeting with Boston officials Monday.
The Boston Transportation Department and the mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services hosted the meeting, held at the Honan-Allston Library, to give Allstonians a chance to suggest possible solutions to traffic concerns surrounding Windom Street. The road crosses near the plot of Allston land Harvard plans to develop into its “Enterprise Research” campus.
The University first proposed developing a 36-acre lot of land in Allston into an enterprise research campus to promote entrepreneurship in 2011. In Dec. 2017, Harvard filed plans for the entire campus with the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the city’s urban planning body.
Concerns about traffic in Allston have been a common theme at community meetings held with city and state transportation officials across the last month. Last week, Allstonians rallied to ask Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to implement plans to alleviate vehicle congestion.
The gathering Monday follows several other meetings held over the past few weeks specifically to discuss traffic and transit issues.
During the meeting, Warren O’Reilly, the constituency liaison for Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh, took notes as residents shared their worries over traffic congestion on Windom Street.
Allstonians stressed the importance of addressing current vehicle congestion issues now, given they believe construction associated with Harvard’s enterprise research campus will only exacerbate the problem. Residents proposed erecting jersey barriers between traffic lanes to reduce traffic.
Joyce Radnor, an Allston resident, recounted her experiences navigating through morning rush hour traffic with Cambridge commuters.
“In the mornings, it’s impossible to back out of your driveway—[you’re] sitting there for 10 minutes waiting to back out,” she said. “What we’re trying to do is find a way to limit Windom to local traffic.”
Allston residents also raised concerns that the traffic congestion on Windom Street does not seem to be a priority for Massachusetts.
Attendees asked if Commonwealth representatives could attend future meetings and explain the development timeline in more detail.
Jim Gillooly, the deputy commissioner at the Boston Transportation Department, attended the meeting and responded to residents’ concerns Monday night.
“I can ask the state if they can come over,” Gillooly said. “They do hold the bigger meetings for the very purpose you are talking about.”
Near the close of the event, Bill Conroy, a representative from the Boston Transportation Department, laid out the steps he and Gillooly will pursue following Monday’s meeting.
“What will happen after tonight is we’ll go back to city hall and talk to city planners and engineers and also [the] mayor's office and the commissioner of transportation and come up with a solution,” he said. “Then, [we’ll] come back here and have another meeting with you and present the other option[s].”

Harvard is seeking its 29th president. Ever since University President Drew G. Faust announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018, a specially convened presidential search committee has been hunting for her successor. The secretive, months-long search will chart the University’s course for decades to come.
The presidential search committee comprises 15 people: all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and three members of the Board of Overseers, the second-highest governing body. Corporation Senior Fellow William F.  Lee '72 is leading the committee, which formed in June.
For the first couple of months, the searchers gathered information—talking to hundreds of Harvard affiliates and reviewing nearly 700 nominations for potential presidents. Some alumni called on the committee to consider a diverse slate of candidates; until Faust, all of Harvard’s presidents have been white men.
In September, committee members started jetting in to Cambridge to meet behind closed doors at Loeb House, the Corporation’s chandelier-filled stomping grounds at Harvard. In December, The Crimson reported the committee had narrowed its shortlist to fewer than 20 candidates.
Alums and faculty say likely Harvard-employed candidates include Provost Alan M. Garber '76, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and Government professor Danielle S. Allen. In December, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley '82  named Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, and University of Michigan President Mark S. Schlissel as potential contenders as well.
The Crimson reported in January that Kim is in contact with the search committee—and that he is debating the pros and cons of accepting Harvard’s top job with close friends and advisers. Kim wrote in an emailed statement that he is “completely committed” to his job at the World Bank.
Harvard presidential searches are famous for their secrecy. Experts say the total confidentiality is meant in part to protect candidates from being perceived as disloyal to their current jobs.
Past search committees did everything they could to keep the names of shortlist candidates confidential—interviewing contenders in posh New York hotels and committee members’ homes to evade reporters. Searchers even snuck possible presidents up back-service stairways and through underground garages for interviews. Despite these efforts, The Crimson scooped the presidential pick in the last three searches: Neil L. Rudenstine in 1991, Lawrence H. Summers in 2001, and Faust in 2007.
This year’s iteration of the search committee has been no less secretive. Searchers have repeatedly declined to comment publicly on the search. In early January, members of the committee convened in private at the Belmont, Mass. home of a searcher, spending almost the whole day in closeted discussions as they prepare to make a final choice in the coming weeks.
With the search now approaching its eighth month, the committee is likely interviewing top contenders, according to experts. If history is any guide, the committee will make its final choice in February or March.
Faust’s successor will face a number of challenges: overseeing Harvard’s expansion into Allston, navigating an increasingly global role, and implementing the College’s penalties on single-gender social groups. Harvard’s 29th president will become the new face not just of Harvard, but of higher education around the world.

Ah, freshmen. They run around campus, perpetually late to class even with Harvard time, lanyards swinging wildly around their necks. (Keys have hit faces. They’re learning.) They say parties they went to were “lit af” when really, 20 people got shoved in a tiny space with citrus-flavored vodka, only to be kicked out by a proctor shortly thereafter and forced to pour any remaining dregs of libations down the drain. The freshman experience can be decidedly unglamorous.
Carb-loading at 10 p.m. before starting a p-set that’s due the next day, though? Absolutely clutch. Here are a few snippets of conversations taken completely out of context from Brain Break at Annenberg.
Freshman Boys vs. Grilled Cheese Crusts“You’re not eating the crust?!”“No.”“But how can you even tell it’s the crust?”“Because it’s so much harder!”“No it isn’t!”Cue comparison of crunching sounds while biting into the “crust” of respective grilled cheese sandwiches.
The Math Pun of Doom“Well, I have to get back to the grind…the integrind…integral…”
Following Facebook Drama“Oh, is that the guy that everyone hates?”
What School Do You Go to Again?“[The movie]’s about this girl who’s thinking about running away to marry a boy nun.”“A boy nun?”“…Yeah?”“Do you mean a monk?”“Oh sh*t, true, yeah.”“You sure you go to Harvard?”
Contextualized Out of Context“Keep in mind this is an African Jew at a black party…”
Political Wrecking Ball?“Do you want to build balls over bridges? Walls over bridges? Whatever, you know what I mean. F*ck Trump.”
This. Is. Disillusionment.“I mean, if you think about it, CS50 p-sets are really beautiful.”Cue snorts of disbelief.
Relationship Status? It’s Complicated.“But you’re not together right?”“No, we’re like, friends, but we’ve like, hooked up a few times. We haven’t had sex though; I don’t think I want to.”“So you’re like FWLB. Friends With Limited Benefits.”“Yes! Exactly!”
Keep an eye out for more freshman ~witticisms~ as the year goes on. Stay weird, Class of 2021.

Harvard may have a world-renowned student body and faculty, but it’s our community of incredible dogs that really makes us one-of-a-kind. Kirkland House in particular boasts a considerable line-up of canines. Here are eight of Harvard’s fluffiest and friendliest.
Owners: Tutors Christine Baugh and Gil Weintraub
We begin with Boogie, the new face of the Kirkland Canine Clan—he moved in this past October. Boogie is a sheepadoodle (a mix between an Old English Sheepdog and a Standard Poodle), and is just about 20 weeks old. We are excited to get to know all of of the quirky things about our newest pup…look out for him on Dunster Street!
Owners: Faculty Deans Verena and Tom Conley
AgesMax: 8Bella: 6
Nicknames/Origin of nameMax: Short for Maximilian.Bella: Tom was reading a French poem, and “bel œil,” meaning “beautiful eye,” stood out, since their new pup had such beautiful eyes. Bella sounded similar to the French phrase!
Favorite Human FoodMax: Huge counter surfer. Loves loaves of bread, pizza, sausages, and oranges (with the peel). Whatever is on the table.Bella: A bit pickier than Max.
Tricks?They both will give you the classic paw.
Origin storyMax: Tom and Verena previously owned 2 dogs, Jesse and Brandy. When Brandy passed away, Jesse became depressed, so they got Max to keep her company.Bella: Their cat, Joe, passed away suddenly, so someone offered them Bella. They accepted the dog!
Something quirky (because it’s Kirky)Max loves to be groomed and coiffed.Bella hates it.

Owners: Tutors Kim and Axel Oaks Takas
Age2 and a half years
NicknamesPoodle, Don, Donnie, Pumpkin, Princess, Baby Don
Favorite Human FoodBananas
Tricks?Tons of frisbee tricks. Flip, catch, through the legs, above the legs, behind the back. Baby Don can jump, that’s for sure.
Origin storyKim and Axel were living in an apartment before they became tutors at Kirkland. They knew they were going to move to Kirkland House, but couldn’t have a dog in the apartment they were living in at the time. They tried to ignore all of the dogs up for adoption, but Axel succumbed, and looked into Poodle Rescue New England. They found Donovan, a purebred standard poodle for rescue (which is extremely rare, as they usually cost thousands of dollars). The couple put in an application, and the next day, they got a phone call from the foster parents, saying they were the perfect parents! So, they convinced their landlord to let them keep Donovan before the move.
Something quirkyHe sleeps with half of his body on the couch (back legs on the couch), or sleeps like a bridge across the couch and ottoman.When he’s bored he starts listening for words he knows.


Owner: Tutor Edie Johnson 
Age~4 (estimated because he was a stray)
Nicknames/Origin of nameCookster, Cooks, Puppers, Spud(He can tell by the voice you’re using that he’s being spoken to.)Foster parent called him Oreo, and that’s why Edie named him Cookie.
Favorite Human FoodLoves carrots, hates peas.
Tricks?Tries to play dead, but can’t stop wagging his tail. Edie hasn’t dared correct him.
Origin storyFound on petfinder.com, he’s from a rescue based in Texas. He came from a foster parent.
Something quirkyCookie has a dish with peas and carrots, so he eats the carrots and spits the peas out on the floor.He likes to sleep under the covers.


Owner: Tutors Rory Lindsay and Dina Wang
Age10 (but still super playful!)
NicknamesGoo (their previous dog was very ‘licky,’ so they called him Goo. Then, in the family, all dogs became Goos.)
Favorite Human FoodWon’t steal food, but very food motivated.She will eat really anything.
Tricks?Paw shake and high-five (if there is a food reward).
Origin storyThey wanted a Golden Retriever, but they also wanted a rescue. So, they went to the Delaware Valley Golden Retriever Rescue near Philadelphia. They got her at age 7 with the name Arista from her previous family. They don’t know much about her past, but there was clear evidence she was abused by an older man figure, since she used to cower around older men in public. Living in Kirkland House has helped her overcome that fear! She’s rarely alone there, and she is very preoccupied with Kirkland  students.
Something quirkyIf you scratch the base of her tail, she will start to wiggle and play bite, rolling around and snapping her jaws like a crocodile.
She makes a grunting sound that sounds like a growl if she’s hungry or if she’s happy (kind of like a cat purring?).


Owners: Tutors Alex Lupsasca and Cardin Kennedy 
Age9
NicknamesGill, Gilster, Gillybeans, Gilbeans
Favorite Human FoodBanana, or any sort of fruit.She loves boba from bubble tea, too.
Tricks?She can sit, shake, and lie down.
Origin storyCardin got Gilly when she was 16 years old from a friend of a friend of a friend who had a litter of pugs.
Something quirkyGilly only has one eye. Also, she doesn’t bark. She is incredibly food motivated. Her level of intelligence triples when food is involved. As Alex tells: “Let’s just say she’s not the brightest banana in the bunch most of the time, but, if somehow there is food involved, all of the sudden she becomes Einstein.”

Owners: Resident Deans Tom and Verena Conley 
Last, but certainly not least, is the Resident Deans' newest pup, Sasha. Sasha is around 19 weeks old, and is a Bernese Mountain dog like her older companions, Max and Bella. If you’re lucky, you’ll catch Sasha playing with Boogie in the courtyard!
