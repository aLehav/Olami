After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three big queer cheers for “Am I Ok?”, a poignant coming-of-age-ish dramedy — heavier on the comedy than the drama — that knows its wheelhouse, commits to form, and hits all the right beats.
Directed by married duo Tig Notaro and Stephanie Allynne, the film follows two lifetime best friends in their early 30s, Lucy (Dakota Johnson) and Jane (Sonoya Mizuno), who tell each other everything and have long settled into a comfortably codependent L.A. rhythm. Lucy is the receptionist at a spacious oceanside spa that seems to have only one other employee, and she’s never been that interested in dating; Jane enjoys vapid coworkers and a well-stocked company kitchen at her marketing job and lives with her longtime boyfriend Danny (Jermaine Fowler). Their dynamic hits a snag when Jane gets a work promotion that will send her to London and Lucy, sad and drunk from the news in a sequence played with tremendous feeling by Johnson, reveals that she’s gay. Hijinks ensue, and the two seismic changes unearth cracks in their relationship.
The script, written by Lauren Pomerantz and drawn loosely from her own experiences, feels mechanical at times but zips along just fine. The characters are drawn with clear motives and patterns, and when Lucy and Jane start to take jabs at each other, their mutual reads are specific and well-earned. The two leads have good bantering chemistry; Mizuno in particular is a crisp, believable deliverer of even the most unnatural dialogue.
While Johnson can call upon chameleon acting chops when necessary, her famously lime-agnostic “chaotic calm” offscreen energy is deployed to great effect in the film — it’s an energy that works surprisingly well in the evolving rom-com genre, or maybe just the queer ones. (“How To Be Single” fans, show yourselves!) Her gentleness evokes that of a baby bird’s, vindicating Jane’s somewhat patronizing instinct to both protect her best friend and push her out of the nest. But the steely self-actualization underlying that mellow energy ultimately grounds Jane’s own arc of self-discovery, even if Johnson doesn’t quite sell her character’s initial frazzle about the emotional and social consequences of her newly articulated identity.
Scoring Johnson for this role was a coup of casting by Notaro and Allynne. (The two apparently brought Johnson onboard when Notaro performed stand-up at Johnson’s infamous birthday party in Malibu that a certain gay daytime host did not attend.) But scene-stealers galore populate Lucy and Jane’s world. Queer actress Kiersey Clemons, who has carved out a subniche in her burgeoning career for lighthearted WLW stories (“Hearts Beat Loud,” “Easy”), is charming and charismatic in “Am I Ok?” as Brittany, the flirty masseuse who Jane develops a crush on. Molly Gordon, miles away from her grounded queer ex-girlfriend character in last year’s indie darling “Shiva Baby,” is hilariously exaggerated as Jane’s Instagram-obsessed work friend.
The movie is set in a familiarly stylized version of an affluent, star-studded Los Angeles scene. Stephanie Allynne may be best-known at this point for her role on “The L Word: Generation Q,” and from its milieu-establishing opening montage of mostly-white women hanging out in various bars and well-appointed homes, “Am I Ok?” seems to suggest its existence in a kind of “L Word” multiverse. The film hews closely and self-consciously to this version of queer L.A., and it’s hard to argue with the idea of a gay multiverse of any kind. But this narrowness does raise the question of how festivals like Sundance can do more to represent the diverse multiplicity of queer storytelling that is waiting to explode across big and, increasingly, small screens.
In the lead-up to “Am I Ok?”’s premiere, much was made of how refreshing it is to see a woman onscreen who’s 32 and still figuring herself out. The representation of this widely held but underexplored experience is thrilling and important, to be sure. And from a narrative perspective, removing the context for an unavoidable coming-out-to-parents plotline creates breathing room in Lucy’s journey of gay awakening. But it’s also quite satisfying, in the most instinctual sense, to watch a queer-created crowd-pleasing comedy milk laughs from stereotypes about queer women rather than heterosexual coupledom. Driving a Volvo (“Jane, Volvos are the safest car!”), a city’s gay scene all knowing and having dated each other (“You’re gonna be the star of the lesbian community”), the steady creep of black beanies onto Dakota Johnson’s curious head — it’s all there. They’re lazy jokes, the kind that every straight movie gets to make. Mass-market queer humor won’t bring liberation, but it’s fun nonetheless.
“Am I Ok?”, despite its breeziness, also gets some painful stuff just right. “I know it’s fine and no one cares, but I care,” Lucy explains to Jane about her coming out — even with the knowledge that no one in her life will think differently of her for being gay, Lucy’s anxieties about the actualities of disclosure and whether or not her gayness “shows” on her personhood are poignantly rendered. And the fuzzy boundary between platonic and erotic that marks Lucy and Brittany’s connection, and the confusion and hurt it ultimately causes, ring all too true for any queer woman, or really anyone, who’s been in a similar situation.
The movie leaves one major question mark. Hints are dropped that Lucy and Jane have some fuzziness, too — not least the main promotional image. Without giving too much away, this thread feels unresolved or even ignored. Perhaps the seminal comedy about the complexities of queer friendship is yet to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nancy Stokes has never had an orgasm. She has also only ever had sex — boring, roll-on-roll-off, missionary sex — with one man, her recently deceased husband. She hasn’t had much adventure elsewhere in her life, either. So Nancy, a religious education teacher with a moralizing streak, makes the somewhat surprising decision to hire a sex worker named Leo Grande.
A delicate, heartfelt film emerges from this simple premise, which contains more nuance than the synopsis might suggest. Taking place almost entirely in a London hotel room, director Sophie Hyde’s “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” brings together two wonderful actors — the majestic Emma Thompson as Nancy and the insanely charismatic Daryl McCormack as Leo — and puts them in poignant conversation about sex, intimacy and desire over three “sessions” and a trim hour and a half that rarely drags. (Indeed, one wonders whether a stage adaptation might bring a welcome doubling-down on both the claustrophobic and freeing potential of the setting.) While the characterization struggles to move beyond tropes at times, “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” is steadfastly clear-eyed in its message and empathetic in its exploration of sexual self-empowerment at all ages.
The first few moments of the movie set a poignant yet comedic tone. We watch Nancy arrive at the hotel room and putter around, unsure of how to prepare for the encounter, while the confident, thoughtful Leo checks his appearance in the reflection of a shop window as he walks to the hotel. When Leo knocks on the door, he’s suave even through the peephole; Nancy is a bundle of nerves embodied. Hyde deftly establishes the starting points for these two characters before they even impress upon one another.
And impress upon one another they do, quickly, in a wonderful erotics of conversation. This is a movie about sex, but dialogue between Nancy and Leo forms the bulk of the runtime. Luckily, Katy Brand’s script crackles, as does the two leads’ bantering chemistry. Their crisp, expansive exchanges are stuffed full of one-off laugh lines — “It’s an orgasm, not a Fabergé egg,” uttered by Leo in a moment of exasperation with Nancy’s pessimism about achieving one, is a favorite — but the cleverness never comes off as caustic or deflective. Rather, the bond that the two form over the course of each session feels natural, deeply felt. When Nancy generates a laundry list of sex acts she has never tried and wants to hit them on a timetable, Leo’s takes a gentle, kindhearted poke at her approach, and Nancy accepts his critique with a genuine laugh that visibly loosens the tension in her body. The pair’s connection feels authentic, although the movie can never quite decide whether it violates the boundaries that should exist between them as service provider and client.
Thompson remains pitch-perfect, bringing an astonishing physicality to Nancy’s anxieties and calibrating their slow dissolution as she gets increasingly comfortable with Leo. And while McCormack is certainly not the household name in this duo, he should join Thompson there soon. Leo tells Nancy that reading people is what makes him good at his job, and McCormack’s subtly expressive face sparkles with that ability. His supernatural magnetism — both emotional and sexual — pops off the screen, rendering his guiding role in Nancy’s arc plausible. And when the relationship between Nancy and Leo, which is of course that of an employer and employee, inevitably turns sour in the third act, McCormack activates the kernels of resentment that had been building up between them with a concentrated, captivating rage. The unease that had heretofore only played out in Leo’s eyes when Nancy pried about his personal life finally reaches its breaking point, and the stakes rise beyond the circumstances of the hotel room.
Those kernels of resentment, it should be said, are too carefully placed to feel satisfying in their denouement. Conversations about Nancy’s adult children and Leo’s relationship with his mother land like thudding Chekhovian guns, however gently they are laid on the mantle. And the development of the previously prim and proper Nancy’s views on sex work, and sexuality in general, ultimately suffers from underexposition. Her pro-sex verdict requires some acceptance on the audience’s part that Nancy reflected internally on the conversations she had with Leo, both about the politics and dangers of sex work and on the liberation of female pleasure. But since the film is so dialogic, hewing closely to the observable dynamics between its two main characters, her final stance feels somewhat unearned — and the ending overall a bit pat.
Still, “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” wears its heart on its sleeve. A too-clean resolution doesn’t detract from the triumphant duet of Thompson and McCormack, who make the film worth a watch for their performances alone.

Services at Wander to Greater Paths Baptist Church — a Black megachurch in Atlanta — are blockbuster performances, but the seams have started to show. Writer and director Adamma Ebo’s bleak, biting satire “Honk for Jesus, Save Your Soul” follows Trinitie Childs (Regina Hall) and her husband Lee-Curtis (Sterling K. Brown), the formerly baronial first lady and pastor of the church, as they attempt to reopen their doors for Easter Sunday and restore their status in the community after closing down amidst sexual misconduct allegations against Lee-Curtis. Shot partially in a faux-documentary style, “Honk for Jesus, Save Your Soul” is a kinetic and often riotous critique of the socioeconomic rituals and artifices surrounding organized religion, gaining traction as it hardens into an incisive, if unsurprising, portrait of the decaying marriage at the film’s — and the church’s — center.
The movie picks up “One month until First Sunday Back,” according to a banner floating over aerial B-roll footage of the church towering on the horizon. A documentary crew, helmed by an unseen director named Anita, has descended on the Childs’ to capture their triumphant return, or maybe to record their crash-and-burn — Anita’s motives are not immediately clear. Lee-Curtis believes it’s the former, telling his wife that the documentary is going to “chronicle the ultimate comeback”; Trinitie and the audience are more skeptical. The moc-doc is a nifty device that layers in the additional stakes of literally intimate scrutiny. If anything, the film resorts too often to the Childs’ demanding “cut” on the meta-footage as a means of illustrating their loosened grasp on public perception.
The tensions between Trinitie and Lee-Curtis continue to mount, and Hall and Brown are immeasurably fun to watch as cracks widen in their united front. Though the camera stays closer to Hall — who delivers a master class in visceral anxiety masked by performative graciousness as she sizes up possible foes at every turn, from disgruntled former congregants at the mall to the woman looming behind the documentary camera — Ebo and Director of Photography Alan Gwizdowski generate some illuminating two-shots of the couple that emphasize the evolving push-and-pull of their charged, complex dynamic through quotidian interactions: Though they sit at opposite ends of an ostentatiously long table for breakfast, they also rap along to the radio together in the car with an ease that belies a lifetime of loyalty.
Underneath the sheen of their well-appointed life, and even below the film’s mockery of the Childs’ materialism and callous weaponization of their spiritual leadership, a dark underbelly belies the true bleakness of the film’s outlook. Ebo does well to reveal the actual specifics of the accusations against Lee-Curtis in fits and spurts, dropping at first only that the accusers were “consenting adults.” By the time the audience fully grasps the nature of the pastor’s “crimes,” it is also clear that his behavior — that is, his queer longing — will continue, as will his manipulative abuse of power to satisfy that longing.
Brown plays Lee-Curtis as a man thoroughly convinced of his own divinely ordained gifts as a pastor, so much so that he might reasonably compensate for his forbidden desires or even redeem himself in the eyes of God from the pulpit alone. Recorded preaching against the “homosexual agenda,” slick and powerfully embodied in front of thousands of congregants, he betrays no inner turmoil. Trinitie, too, is far less concerned with her husband’s sinfulness than with their ability to keep drawing congregants.
In a Q&A after the movie, Brown spoke to the disquiet within his character, noting that he took on the role with a mind towards the LGBTQ+ Christians in his own family. “It’s those conversations that my character is carrying with him, recognizing that he has desires that don’t fit into this box of Southern Baptist megachurch,” Brown said. The weight of that representation is felt in Brown’s performance, though necessarily as an undercurrent to the moral convolution of his character.
“Honk for Jesus” doesn’t get much from its supporting performances, with the exception of Nicole Beharie (a sleeper star of this year’s Sundance) as one half of Pastor and Pastor Sumpter, the co-preaching couple — a “gimmick” that the Childs’ fear is hard to compete with — who preside over a rival church where congregation numbers have swelled since Wander to Greater Paths closed down. The dueling young upstarts/old vets trope can get tired, but the foursome milk hilarity out of their scenes together, buoyed by a few well-placed “God bless”’s.
The film’s production also sparks a sense of play; the Childs’ are shrouded in immense wealth and unafraid to flaunt it. A memorable scene lets Hall and Brown offer a series of inspired reads of the word “Prada” as they brandish their massive walk-in closet for the camera crew, lined with Trinitie’s extravagant church hats and Lee-Curtis’ rainbow of designer suits, which he has a habit of taking off. The class critique is salient, if less biting than what’s levied at other targets.
Despite (or perhaps through) its comedic tone, “Honk For Jesus, Save Your Soul” tackles its most important threads, including homophobia and masculinity in the Black church, with a clear-eyed nuance. Ultimately, almost every soul in the movie seems too corroded — be it with pettiness, insecurity, or insidiousness — to be saved. But like the dignity-shredding roadside ministry Trinitie and Lee-Curtis set up to advertise their comeback, what makes “Honk for Jesus” so discomfiting is also what makes it difficult to look away from, despite any unevenness. The rising industry duo of Adamma Ebo and her twin sister Adanne Ebo, a producer on the film, announce themselves on the big screen with a baptizing splash.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Greetings, dear reader! And welcome to the only Harvard column that dares to ask, what if we sought our deepest, most profound life advice… from bugs? Is that weird? No, right? Right.
Over the next few months, we’ll dive headfirst into the world’s most amazing insects and explore the multitude of insights they offer. But be warned! Such an endeavor, while noble and rewarding, is not for everyone. So before deciding whether this column is for you, I urge you to consider the following questions:
Do you think it’d be fun to compare your peers to obscure insects? Have you ever felt like opinion pieces have too few entomological references? Do you like reading awesome stuff?
If you said yes to any of these, then congrats! We’re gonna have a great time. If you didn’t, then proceed with caution. My words will bug you.
Anyways.
While researching organisms for this column, I came across a most interesting specimen. Devious, toxic, and fiercely competitive, these miserable creatures spend their days in a self-constructed pit of never-ending desire, waiting to suck the life out of anyone who crosses their path. As adults, they are unable to sleep at night and develop a fatal attraction to shiny things. Yup, you guessed it! I’m talking about econ majors. Wait… no. I meant antlions. Definitely antlions.
Known to scientists as “Myrmeleon formicarius” and to co-workers as “that toxic b**ch,” the antlion begins its predatory life by burying itself at the bottom of a massive, self-made, downwards spiral. Any unsuspecting ant who ventures near is immediately trapped and poisoned. The antlion then begins the long and painful process of extracting the prey’s body fluid — that’s right, this bug literally sucks the life out of others. Once finished, it disposes of the lifeless carcass and waits for its next victim.
While most commonly found in dry, sandy areas, Harvard’s high-stakes (and occasionally carnivorous) environment provides the perfect breeding ground for antlions. From overtly competitive student politicians to ride-or-die Goldman Sachs hopefuls, it’s easy to recognize the combination of ambition, focus, and drive that the insect is known for. And while ambition can be helpful in moderation, too often, our relentless pursuit of success inadvertently hurts the people around us or leaves us lonely and miserable. The antlion can offer three key insights into our behavior.
1) Too often, we hurt other people in our pursuit of success.
This can happen directly (sacrificing friendships in favor of networks curated solely to further our careers) or indirectly (working for wealthy companies that actively disempower millions of people). Yup. Carcasses everywhere. And while we’d all agree harming people is bad, the immense privilege and opportunity afforded to us as Harvard students means we have an even greater responsibility to help ensure the well-being of others. So if you don’t absolutely need to consult for billion-dollar corporations in order to make a living, then don’t!
2) The shiny things we’re attracted to are probably fatal anyways.
Once mature, antlions develop an inexplicable attraction to shiny lights and spend countless sleepless nights fluttering towards them. Many have perished in this never-ending chase and those who manage to survive always return unsatisfied. Is this behavior harmful? Absolutely. Do antlions care? Nah. For Harvard antlions, the danger is two-fold, for when your only considerations are materialistic, it’s very likely you’ll end up in a job you don’t enjoy. And while it’s true that some finance folks genuinely love finance – they use words like, “supply chain” and “market” (the non-grocery version) – it’s also true that a substantial number of students who find themselves on traditionally lucrative paths are completely miserable.
3) A fast-paced and never-ending grind leaves us lonely and sad.
The antlion spends its days alone in a pit, plotting its next move. Sure, it’s real high up on the food chain, but it’s also depressed. To avoid this fate, we need to climb out of our pits, abandon our predatory outlook, and befriend our fellow insects! This means taking a break from that 12-month MCAT study regimen and devoting time specifically to non-work activities. Go on a hike. Check up on a friend. Develop your secret passion for yodeling.
So now we can recognize antlions. Sweet. But what happens if we spot one… in ourselves??? (Insert dramatic gasp.) Don’t fret! The treatment is simple. First, walk yourself to a mirror, look yourself deep in the eyes, and scream “I will not be a carnivorous blood sucker!” as loudly and passionately as you possibly can. Once your roommate has been sufficiently freaked out, you can try more advanced techniques like devoting time to helping others, choosing to pursue careers in public service, or embarking on endeavors that bring you joy. In doing so, you just might avoid the miserable fate of the antlion.

Many in our society suffer disproportionately from systemic racism in ways that dramatically alter their daily lives and future possibilities. Institutions have made initial good faith efforts to correct the longstanding effects of systemic racism. Yet most of these efforts rely on antiquated labels that don’t fully capture the diversity of the United States in the 21st century — and don’t help us to revise our fundamental understanding of race as we try to find better ways to achieve equity.
Let me start with a story.
In 1959, my parents were not allowed to obtain a marriage license in the first two states where they applied. They were different races: a blond white guy and a brown Hawaiian/Pacific Islander woman. After they figured out the marriage license (Colorado finally came through for them), they adopted a son and a daughter, and raised mixed-race kids with parents in a mixed marriage in an overwhelmingly white small Midwestern town. What could possibly go wrong?
In elementary school, I was placed into the remedial classes for the “slow” kids. The teacher responsible for placing me into one of three tracks — remedial, regular, or accelerated — seemed to be unsure as to where I fit in. In middle school, students were selected to take IQ tests, but I was not offered to participate, as only the “smart” kids, not the “slow” ones, supposedly needed this test. In high school, I went to the guidance counselor to ask about taking the SATs. She said that I didn’t need to take this test because it wasn’t clear I would go to college, and, even if I did, the colleges that I would apply to wouldn’t require it. She sent me to meet with the Army recruiter instead.
I was pulled over twice by the police in my overwhelmingly white neighborhood (once with a second police car arriving almost immediately). They let me go without even a warning because I had done nothing wrong, but why did they stop me at all? Did they profile me based on my appearance? I definitely didn’t look like anyone else in my neighborhood. Stories of being pulled over for no good reason are common among Black and brown people. Still, while I was pulled over for questionable reasons, I didn’t think, “so this is how my life ends,” as many Black and brown people in the same situation have.
As a Harvard professor, I have been told that it doesn’t look good for me to lead community disparities/equity projects because I’m “white.” Am I really?
The nearly 34 million Americans who are mixed race — called “beige,” “half-breed,” “hapa,” or worse — often fit nowhere. We may choose a racial or cultural identity, but members of that identity don’t always acknowledge or accept us as their own. In 2010, approximately 15% of marriages in the U.S. were interracial. Why, then, does society still make us choose from a historical menu of ancestries?
Race is a social construct, not a biological one. In the 1790 US Census, you could be “free” or “slave” (read: white or Black). By the late 1800s, you could be white, Chinese or Japanese (reflecting immigration patterns), Black, Mulatto (3/8 - 5/8 Black), Quadroon (1/4 Black), or Octoroon (1/8th Black). These designations for people of Black African ancestry were not designed to lift them up. Soon, the descriptors were replaced with the “one drop rule”: any amount of Black African ancestry made you Black. In 1860, an “Indian” category was added to the US Census, and in 1900, “Indians” who lived on reservations were included as well (American Indians literally didn’t count before then).
When I have to check a box on race, do I report the biological ancestry given to me by the Thai father and Swedish mother I have never met, but are the sources of my physical appearance? Or do I answer according to my cultural heritage and social identity as I was raised (Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Midwestern WASP), even though I don’t look like either of these groups and carry none of their DNA? I can check multiple boxes, but really I identify as a whole person, not disparate individual components. I think of myself as a baked cake, not just the eggs, flour, and sugar that were used to make it. Some forms provide the “other” checkbox option, one that reinforces our otherness as mixed-race people. “Rather not say” is there too sometimes, even if that answer implies that being mixed race is something to be ashamed of. “I’d rather not say” I ate a whole pint of ice cream in one sitting last night; my identity should not be equated to that level of shame.
Since I was old enough to talk and still to this day, the top two questions I hear are: “What are you?” and “Where are you from?” Little microaggressions. Even after more than six decades of being asked, I still don’t have an answer. Sometimes I just turn the question back onto the asker and have them guess.
Other mixed race people around the world have similar experiences. Tiger Woods designates himself as “Cablinasian” (that’s Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian), perhaps because he identifies with all of his ancestries and doesn’t want to be defined by others based on his phenotypic features alone. In Russia’s 2002 census, it was possible to define your ethnicity in any way you wanted, so there were Russian Hobbits and Martians. But even if the U.S. Census allowed me to make something up, I’m not sure what label I’d choose. At the very least, I can say that I don’t want to check ill-fitting boxes, and I don’t want to coin a lonely designation for my ancestral-cultural heritage. Other people’s need to bucket your identity into easy-to-swallow but ultimately inaccurate categories, to the point of forcing you to check boxes in every doctor’s office and application form, takes a psychological toll.
Beyond the dilemma that I and many others face every time a form with a checkbox for race is handed to us, no one seems to have a good idea of why they are asking for this racial information. Is it to understand diversity in the organization’s constituents? If so, is it biological diversity, cultural diversity, socioeconomic diversity, diversity in lived experience such as encounters with racism or discrimination, all of the above, or something else, that is being investigated? Is it to identify and correct gaps in the organization’s diversity goals? Or to inform resource allocation for those who belong to a marginalized group? No matter the answer to these questions, the “race/ethnicity” checkbox alone is unlikely to be the right way to gain the desired information. Consider socioeconomic diversity: Some academic applications now ask if you are the first generation to attend college. This is presumably an attempt to identify socioeconomic position in a way that one’s race/ethnicity does not necessarily reveal. It’s a start, although — like the race/ethnicity checkbox itself — this single question is likely inadequate to achieve the larger goal of socioeconomic diversity.
And yet, we still default to a standard census-derived questionnaire on race to measure the vague concept of diversity. If you are a basic laboratory scientist, you don’t use the same assay for every experiment you do. The methods are determined by the research question, the specific hypotheses to be tested, and the analytical approach best suited to produce a meaningful finding. No good scientist will repeat the same experimental setup over and over, regardless of the question they are trying to answer. But this is our default practice when we measure diversity.
We all fill out forms in the name of diversity, and usually we only see the “please check all that apply” end product. I have never encountered a clearly defined purpose for the collection of my race/ethnicity. Nor is it clear to me who will have access to and use this information, or how this information will achieve some pre-specified goal. I imagine this is because specifying purpose and usage is hard to do, and most don’t know where to start (or even recognize they should).
Many organizations, including The Crimson, have made laudable efforts toward increased diversity and inclusion. But even these efforts don’t look beyond traditional labels — of white, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic — when it comes to race/ethnicity. If we are really serious about achieving diversity and inclusion, we are obligated to do the difficult yet fundamental work of clearly defining the purpose and goals for the labels we use, identifying appropriate metrics, and planning for the future use of collected information. Before we can develop and implement practices, processes, and policies to eliminate the inequities and disparities that marginalized people face, we must take a more considered approach to something as “simple” as the labels with which we are identified.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2022 at 2:28 p.m.
Architects for Harvard’s proposed Enterprise Research Campus in Allston presented updated plans for the project at a Boston Civic Design Commission meeting Tuesday evening.
The development, which will be located next to the Science and Engineering Complex across the street from Harvard Business School, would be home to a hotel and conference center, housing units, green space, and research-focused companies if it is approved by regulators.
The Boston Planning and Development Agency is still reviewing the project. As part of the approval process, the BPDA assists developers in assessing a project’s impact on the environment and transportation and solicits public input.
Allston residents have previously expressed dissatisfaction with Harvard’s affordable housing and public transportation proposals, as well as with Harvard and project developer Tishman Speyer’s engagement in the Allston community.
During Tuesday’s meeting, the group of architectural firms working on the project shared updates to the project plan in response to design critiques.
Daniel H. Baumann, design director for Henning Larsen Architects, began the presentation by addressing previous requests for design changes, including to the project’s labs and conference center.
Baumann and Weston Walker, a partner at the architectural firm Studio Gang, displayed images of the newly-designed entrances to the development’s planned east and west labs, and the connector facade between the two buildings.
“We have added this canopy element that really draws your eye to the main entrance to the West Lab,” said Baumann, describing the entrances’ covered pathways.
Baumann addressed comments from a previous Boston Civic Design Commission meeting that called for a more simplified connector between the East and West Labs and showed the updated design.
Linda Eastley, managing partner of Eastley and Partners, said she was concerned that the new design lacked transparency at the ground and upper levels at the corner of the East and West Labs.
“It's such an important corner facing the river. It's one of the first introductions that a visitor will have to this site,” she said. “I'm certainly sympathetic to the service requirements of the building and find myself still wanting to have some kind of animated ground floor at this corner.”
Eastley added that the inability to see through that corner is “a major drawback.”
Walker said the architects had considered numerous practical alternatives.
“We really did look at almost every option for how to arrange the different vertical and horizontal functions that are necessary for the building to operate properly,” he said. “There's a degree of reality here that we've had to contend with.”
“I still want to see into the building,” Eastley said.
David P. Manfredi, CEO and founder of Elkus Manfredi Architects, commended the architectural team on their integration of previous comments regarding the entrances to the labs.
“I think that’s well done, appropriate and responsive to what we talked about at the last subcommittee,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2022 at 12:36 p.m.
Harvard security guards voted down a union contract offer from Securitas on Monday, sending the two sides back to the bargaining table after nearly four months of negotiations.
Members of 32BJ SEIU voted 127-84 to reject an offer from Securitas that members of the union’s bargaining committee decried as unfair. More than 80 percent of the University’s security workers participated in the vote, which closed last Friday after online ballots were open for four days.
More than 80 percent of the workers who voted to reject Securitas’ most recent contract offer also indicated support for a strike authorization, according to an email sent to workers on Monday by the union’s executive vice president.
John F. Carbone Jr., a member of the 32BJ’s bargaining committee, said Securitas’ offer was “insulting.”
“We’re just trying to get a decent contract,” said Amel A. Ahmed, who also serves on the union’s bargaining committee.
“We’re not asking for 1 million dollars,” Ahmed said. “We’re not asking for raises above inflation. We’re not asking to be treated differently than anyone else. We’re just asking for fair treatment.”
32BJ SEIU Executive Vice President Roxana Rivera wrote in an emailed statement that the union “is committed to reaching a strong contract agreement with Securitas, one that the membership fully supports.”
The union, which represents just shy of 300 Harvard security guards, is seeking to renew bargaining efforts on the contract, Rivera said.
“These essential workers have kept Harvard safe and secure throughout the pandemic, and they need and deserve sufficient wage increases, job protections, and other benefits,” Rivera wrote. “As a result, we are asking Securitas to come back to the bargaining table.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
The contract proposal was brought to a vote by 32BJ despite opposition from the union’s bargaining committee, according to Ahmed.
All 32BJ members are now working without a contract after the workers’ previous agreement with Securitas expired on Jan. 13.
“We are hopeful that, together, we can achieve an agreement that helps these officers achieve the best for themselves and their families,” Rivera wrote.
Securitas declined to comment.
Without a contract, the security guards cannot enter arbitration processes over issues such as unjust terminations, according to Ahmed, though they can still file employment grievances.
“You want to be able to go to arbitration … to try to save someone’s job,” Ahmed said. “We don’t have that.”
32BJ will hold a virtual town hall with its members next Friday to discuss the state of negotiations.
“The union remains steadfast in our goal of achieving a new contract that protects members, recognizes our members’ hard work and garners the support of the membership,” Rivera wrote in an email to union members on Monday.

Former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 will join the Harvard Kennedy School next week as a professor and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership, the school announced Tuesday.
Patrick served as the first Black governor of Massachusetts between 2007 and 2015. After declining to run for a third term as governor, he took a position with Bain Capital. Patrick briefly returned to politics in 2019 when he launched a failed bid for president in the 2020 election.
“I am thrilled that Governor Patrick will be joining Harvard Kennedy School,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in a press release. “With his deep and varied experience as a public leader and his important work as a civil rights advocate, Patrick will be a distinguished member of our practitioner faculty."
Patrick said it was an “honor” to be joining the Kennedy School.
“With the scale and scope of the challenges facing humankind, the world needs conscientious, dedicated leaders at every level in every sector, people willing to spend their ‘political’ capital, not just accumulate it,” Patrick said in a press release. “I am looking forward to working alongside and encouraging leaders like that at the Kennedy School.”
David R. Gergen, founding director of the Center for Public Leadership, said in an interview that he was “ecstatic” to have Patrick join the center, calling him a “first-class guy.”
“I’m excited about him coming, but I think he’s also going to bring a more intense focus to leadership itself,” Gergen said.
Gergen also said he anticipates Patrick and current director Hannah R. Bowles will complement each other very well as co-directors.
“He will be more Mr. Outside versus her Ms. Inside,” he said. “I think they make a great team.”
Bowles wrote in a press release that she was excited to be co-directing the center with Patrick.
“I am honored and overjoyed to have this opportunity to partner with Governor Patrick in leading CPL,” Bowles said. “Our students will benefit tremendously by learning from him as [a] role model and from his depth of experience with thorny and meaningful leadership challenges.”
Gergen said the Kennedy School should be “very grateful” Patrick is joining the faculty.
“A man of Deval Patrick’s stature, his character, his positive view of the future, I think will be an inspiration to not only the students but to the faculty and the staff,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard affiliates — Marissa Sumathipala ’22 and Harvard Medical School student James A. Diao — were tapped for the prestigious Churchill Scholarship and Kanders Churchill Scholarship, respectively, earlier this month.
The Churchill Scholarship, first awarded in 1963, and the Kanders Churchill Scholarship, established in 2017, are awarded to 18 students annually in the fields of science, engineering, and mathematics. The awards fund a one-year master’s study program at the University of Cambridge.
“Churchill is a life changing opportunity for my scientific trajectory,” Sumathipala wrote in an email.
Sumathipala, a Neuroscience concentrator, said she became interested in her field of study at a young age. She began conducting at-home experiments in her home at 13, and by 16, she landed a research position at a lab in her home state of Virginia, where she studied how fruit flies make behavioral decisions.
At Harvard, she continued doing research, working at Harvard Medical School’s McCarroll Lab to study how neurons communicate at synapses in the human brain.
Sumathipala said she grew up dreaming of becoming a professional figure skater, but was forced to give up Olympic dreams after suffering a severe concussion during her sophomore year of high school.
“I spent years in recovery, struggling with dizziness, memory loss, and fatigue,” she wrote.
But her experience recovering from the head injury led her to science, she said.
“Through my own experiences, and those of the patients I met in waiting rooms and support groups, I realized how little modern medicine had to offer for those struggling with brain injury and disease,” she said.
For her master’s project, Sumathipala plans to work on a specialized technique to grow human brains from patients suffering from severe neurological diseases by reprogramming skin cells to stem cells and then growing the brains in a dish.
Diao, a third-year medical student in the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, is a Texas native who attended Yale as an undergraduate. He has published an array of research, including in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA.
Among other studies, Diao’s research on the use of race in kidney function tests led to changes in national recommendations for diagnosis standards.
“I think what was really interesting for me was that the work didn’t just end with a result and a publication, but rather, necessitated more work beyond that to bring together different stakeholders to make a difference in this space,” he said.
As a Kanders Churchill scholar, Diao plans to pursue a master’s degree in public policy.
Correction: January 26, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated James A. Diao's research was published in Nature and Science. In fact, those publications featured news stories about his work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Institute of Politics will pilot a Conferences Committee to centralize planning for some of its major programs.
The Conferences Committee – the IOP’s first new program since 2018 – will be responsible for organizing IOP events and conferences under the umbrella of the committee, rather than under the Harvard Political Union as in previous years.
Past events have included a biennial seminar for newly elected mayors and a conference of presidential campaign managers.
The committee — led by co-chairs Desiree A. Rickett ’24 and Aristotle M. Vainikos ’23 — will oversee planning for at least the remainder of 2022.
Rickett said she is both “nervous” and “excited” about starting her role as co-chair of the new IOP program.
“It feels like a very important position,” she said. “So I’m nervous and want to make sure that I do everything correctly and that I hopefully set the foundation for a lot of successful years in the Conferences Committee to come.”
Rickett said she is prepared for the challenges she will face as co-chair of the pilot program.
“There's something great about kind of going into the unknown — not really knowing what the year’s agenda is going to look like, not knowing exactly how every single meeting is going to run — but instead getting to be that person who tries it out who sees who makes mistakes,” she said.
Vainikos, Rickett’s co-chair and former chair of the Harvard Political Union, said his past focus as chair on “the student aspect” of conferences — formerly “nestled” in HPU — will help him lead the new committee.
The idea of separating the conference planning aspect from HPU had been in the works for some time, according to Vainikos.
“The general concept of making this distinct role was in my head for a while,” he said.
Vainikos noted that he anticipates the new role will involve “a lot of communication and interaction.”
“The new role is going to be a nice blend of strategic planning, week-to-week management, and then what I would call people-to-people connections, working with other students first, to help them contribute, and then eventually help them execute the conference.”
Vainikos added that he and Rickett will also spearhead communications with outside groups who participate in the committee-organized conferences.
Janna E. Ramadan ’23, president of the IOP, said the committee will work on multiple upcoming events, including the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement, which aims to encourage civic engagement among students nationwide.
Another conference the committee will oversee is the Bipartisan Program for Newly Elected Members of Congress, an orientation program for U.S. representatives that will be held following the 2022 election.
Ramadan said she hopes the Conferences Committee program will create a “greater IOP umbrella identity.”
“Sometimes people will say, ‘Oh, I'm part of the IOP, but I'm part of this program or that program,’” she said. “We want people to feel like they can be a part of this broader IOP umbrella community on a macro scale.”
Students can apply to join the Conferences Committee through the IOP’s Common Application, which is open to applicants until Feb. 2.

UPDATED: January 26, 2022 at 11:09 p.m.
Like many Harvard students, Roberta C. Yun '23 turns to the Q Guide — the College’s platform through which students evaluate their courses and teaching staff — each semester for guidance on picking the best classes.
“I use the Q Guide whenever I'm looking to sign up for classes,” she said. “Then I always scroll through and look at the estimated hours per week and also try and look at the comments if I can.”
The Q Guide, which stores data on nearly 1,000 courses and more than 2,000 faculty and section leaders, traces its origins to 1925 with The Crimson’s “Confidential Guide to Courses.” In 1973, the College created its own formal evaluation system, which was renamed to the Q system in 2006.
At the end of each term, students submit ratings and written feedback for their teaching staff and classes, which are then made available across the University to aid in course selection. Recently, professors were given the choice whether or not to share qualitative comments to students.
As much as students regard the Q guide as a vital component of their course selection process, it carries a much different weight to teaching staff — especially graduate students.
Danielle C. Leavitt-Quist, a Ph.D. candidate in History, identified three main purposes of the Q Guide from the perspective of graduate students.
“The first is just personal reflection and development,” she said. “Second would be in the development of a teaching portfolio when you go on the academic job market, and the third is internally within a department, serving as a distinguisher between other Ph.D. students in the department.”
Indeed, the Q Guide is one of the principal ways instructors are evaluated and can, by extension, significantly impact an emerging academic career.
Sarah J. Bramao-Ramos, a graduate student in History and East Asian Languages and Civilizations, said that job applications often ask for “demonstration of teaching excellence.” She said the type of information that a candidate chooses to present to fulfill that application requirement is up to them, but the Q Guide provides a quick solution.
Adam G. Beaver, director of pedagogy at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, discussed the role evaluations like the Q Guide play in the academic job market.
“There are some euphemisms that are used sometimes in job searches,” he said. “Evidence of teaching effectiveness is one you'll sometimes see, which basically means, ‘Send us a kind of portfolio of materials, including your student evaluations.’”
He added, however, that graduate students "overinflate" the weight of Q evaluations in the academic job market and emphasized that search committees consider far more than Q scores when reviewing teaching applications.
Some graduate students said the Q Guide holds tremendous value when they apply to future positions.
Elizabeth L. Hentschel, a Ph.D. candidate in Global Health, said Q Guide evaluations hold a particular importance for students pursuing a doctorate.
“Students that are working on their Ph.D.s have a vested interest in receiving good feedback on their course evaluations for future professor jobs or anything in academia,” she said.
Leavitt-Quist said when she reminds undergraduates of the Q Guide, she emphasizes the importance of the Q evaluations as “something that stays on my teaching record.”
“These scores will follow a teaching fellow, maybe not throughout their career, but definitely in the first four or five years when they’re trying to secure a tenure-track position,” Leavitt-Quist said.
Still, Bramao-Ramos said the Q Guide is only “one piece of a bigger puzzle” in the recruiting process. According to her, employers also consider a candidate’s course enrollment numbers, publications, conferences, and more when making promotion decisions.
Harvard itself uses Q Guide evaluations to present awards to teaching staff, which graduate students often then include in their resumes.
“This definitely will go into my teaching portfolio if I ever write one,” Louis V. Cammarata, a graduate student in Statistics, said of his award. “The teaching award, in my experience, is a very, very useful feature of the Q guide.”
Leavitt-Quist said the History department uses Q Guide evaluations in their selection of Ph.D. students to receive their own instructorship.
“There’s a program called the History Prize of Instructorship, which is where a Ph.D. student in the department—usually it’s two or three each year—is awarded this instructorship, where they’re able to teach their own class independent of a tenured professor,” she said.
Nina Zipser, dean for faculty affairs and planning, wrote in an email that Q Guide evaluations are a relevant part of assessing teaching staff.
“Evaluations are one source of information about faculty teaching, along with other sources such as statements faculty write about their own teaching, advising, and mentoring, or input from faculty mentors who have observed someone’s teaching,” Zipser wrote.
However, some Harvard faculty said student implicit bias can affect the utility of the Q Guide in evaluating teaching.
Mathematics preceptor Oliver R. Knill wrote that he believes there is a danger of positive bias for teaching staff of certain identities.
“It is not only gender and race but also origin, age, title or look. This again shows how important it is to evaluate using different channels. Bias can be positive or negative,” he wrote. “The famous Dr. Fox experiment, where an actor gives a non-sense talk to medical doctors, shows that also positive bias can happen.”
“Dr. Fox was introduced and dressed like an expert and got stellar evaluations, even [though] everything was garbage,” he added. “They were blinded by look, manner and initial third party praise.”
Seth Robertson, a lecturer in Philosophy, identified reinforcing prejudice as the biggest issue with the Q system.
“White, male, cis, able-bodied instructors with regular voices get repeated as much more credible,” Robertson said. “That can affect people who aren’t from the most privileged backgrounds in negative ways a lot.”
“Typically, the actual evaluations are only seen by people in the department, who know about this stuff,” Robertson said. “But if it’s going to be seen by the entire student body, most of whom aren’t really aware of these prejudices, it can oftentimes just lead to repeating them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Women’s Ice Hockey team had a strong run against Princeton and Quinnipiac last weekend, beating both teams despite very close scores.
“Two hard fought wins on the road,” said Women’s Ice Hockey head coach Katey Stone. “Our kids played with confidence and poise in pressure situations.”
One particularly impressive player throughout the weekend was senior goalie Becky Dutton, who won the ECAC weekly award for recording 50 saves throughout the weekend.
HARVARD 3, QUINNIPIAC 2
On Jan. 22, the Crimson faced Quinnipiac, who had an impressive record of (17-3-3, 9-2-0 ECAC).
Just 3:01 into the match, senior captain Emma Buckles scored the first goal of the match. The Crimson’s lead would double when Quinnipiac provided a turnover, allowing Harvard’s leading scorer, junior forward Anne Bloomer, to score against the Bobcats.
The score tightened when Bobcat Sadie Peart scored 7:50 into the third period. Shortly after, however, Harvard sophomore forward Shannon Hollands reclaimed the Crimson’s two-goal lead by taking advantage off of a rebound from Quinnipiac goalie, who was recovering from senior forward Dominique Petrie’s initial shot attempt.
The Bobcats persisted despite the margin and pulled out their goalie for an extra attacker. Quinnipiac’s Zoe Boyd tightened the score to 3-2 with 2:36 left. However, the Bobcats were unable to score against the clutch Dutton after that, ending in a victory for the Crimson.
Dutton had a standout performance, achieving a season-high of 31 saves.
“Beating Quinnipiac was a really great feeling, and it just shows how special of a group we have in the locker room this year,” Dutton said. “Our d-zone coverage was great this weekend and was a huge contributing factor to us winning those games.”
HARVARD 1, PRINCETON 0
Before their first match against Princeton on the previous day, the Crimson had a record of (12-5, 9-3 ECAC), while the Tigers had a record of (8-7-3, 6-4-1 ECAC).
Although both teams had many chances to score, neither team managed to capitalize on their opportunities during the early stages of the game. 39 minutes in, senior forward Brooke Jovanovich managed to score the one and only goal of the match. Petrie provided the assist and carried the puck to the offensive zone, allowing Jovanovich to swing a backhand shot past Princeton’s goalie Rachel McQuigge.
Despite the hooking call on Harvard's Bloomer with 1:33 remaining in the game, the Tigers were not able to capitalize on their six-on-four advantage.
Dutton, who was especially clutch during the game, saved a total of 29 goals, moving herself to 8-2-0 on the season with a 1.40 goals against average (GAA) and .939 save percentage.
“Princeton’s a quick and skilled team, but we came out strong right when the puck dropped and we were all over them the entire game,” Dutton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to Kym Wimberly, it was just a normal play. Yet as the football landed in his arms, the wide receiver came down in the back of the end zone, and as the precious final 22 seconds ticked off the clock at the Yale Bowl, the redshirt junior from Slidell, La., landed a critical blow in one of the country’s most storied college football rivalries. Permanently etched into the history books, Wimberly showed no signs of being overwhelmed by the moment.
“I don’t think it sunk in until after I caught it and after the game was over and everyone was storming the field,” he said.
After the game, Harvard head coach Tim Murphy, the winningest coach in Ivy League football history, praised Wimberly’s resilience. In the weeks leading up to the contest, he had missed multiple practices due to a nagging knee injury, leaving his participation in doubt. But his mother was sure her son would play. He had rebounded from a much more serious injury before, tearing his ACL in his first game as the Crimson’s top receiver, at San Diego on Sept. 21, 2019. Bolstered by his tenacity and his faith, Wimberly recorded three catches for 81 yards, including a 42-yard catch and run to set up the score that would make him a legend in Cambridge.
“I was saying I didn’t know if I was going to play, and [Wimberly’s mother] was saying, ‘Trust in God and you’re going to be fine,’” he recalled. “She sent me a video, basically reiterating all the things she was saying, and I watched the video on the bus when we were going back to Harvard, and I don’t think it really sunk in until that moment.”
It was fitting, perhaps, that it was only on the bus back to campus that Wimberly realized just how much his catch meant for legions of Harvard fans. Slated to graduate with a Government degree in May 2022, he could have transferred to a school with a more illustrious football program and chased his dream of playing in the National Football League. He could have played closer to his family in Louisiana. Because of the season that he lost to the Covid-19 pandemic, he would have had two years of football eligibility left, more than enough time to make a lasting impression on professional scouts.
By doing so, Wimberly would have been following in the footsteps of previous Crimson players. His former teammate Devin Darrington, who racked up 259 carries, 1,117 yards, 12 touchdowns and an All-Ivy Second Team nod between 2017 and 2019, transferred to the University of Virginia for the 2021 season. Darrington added 32 carries, 237 yards, and a pair of scores in 12 games for the Cavaliers before declaring for the 2022 NFL Draft on Dec. 31, 2021. Former Harvard offensive lineman Liam Shanahan played every snap at center in 2020 and 2021 for Louisiana State University. Shanahan is also eligible for the draft in 2022.
“I have been talking to [Darrington] a little bit. He also gave me some advice,” Wimberly said. “Just make the best decision for you. … Knowing what’s the best decision for you, whether it’s coming back or whether it’s going to another school, and to just make the best decision that helps you get to the NFL. That’s probably the biggest advice he has for me, and I’ve had that in the back of my mind the whole time.”
Wimberly was far from the only Crimson player to enter the transfer portal. Multiple redshirt juniors who were expected to graduate in May sought opportunities at other colleges, and some hung up their Harvard jerseys to pursue another offer. Cornerback Khalid Thomas, who recorded three interceptions throughout the course of the season, opted for Samford University. The Crimson also lost its punter, Jon Sot, who had garnered All-Ivy First Team honors in each of his first two seasons before being named to the third team in 2021. Sot chose Notre Dame despite the Fighting Irish landing one of the top high school punters in the 2022 high school class, Bryce McFerson. Defensive lineman Chris Smith, an All-Ivy League First Teamer in 2021, will be suiting up for the University of Minnesota in 2022.
“It hasn’t really had a huge impact on my decision to return, because I know everyone’s situation is different and making the best decision for you is the road that everyone has been taking,” said Wimberly of his teammates’ status in the transfer portal. “But I’m super proud of those guys for locking their decisions in and going to the next level. It’d be great seeing those boys on TV.”
Throughout the process, Wimberly leaned on his coaches, joining Zoom meetings with Murphy and wide receivers coach/offensive coordinator Mickey Fein. Over the phone, the coaches pitched their visions: for him to again be the team’s preferred target. Murphy even called Wimberly’s parents to discuss his plans with them. Eventually, on January 12, Wimberly announced on Instagram that he planned to return for his senior season in 2022.
“Kym came to the conclusion that his best option for being … the number one receiver and have a chance to really have an outstanding season and still leave his options open for a grad transfer after the [2022] season … was back to Harvard,” Murphy explained.
As the Crimson chases its 18th Ivy League championship after falling a controversial call short in 2021, it has already scored a pivotal victory in 2022. Wimberly’s return ensures that junior quarterback Charlie Dean, who started five games in 2021 before suffering an injury in the Oct. 23 loss to Princeton, will be able to throw to a wide receiver who racked up 34 catches, 453 yards, and four touchdowns in his junior season despite being hampered by nagging injuries. Murphy is hopeful that if his star receiver stays healthy, he will be able to produce even better statistics in 2022.
“If he can stay healthy, he’s going to have a chance to really perfect his craft,” he said. “[He should] be able to really put up some good numbers to help our football team and to be the best wide receiver in the Ivy League. If he can regain his health, I absolutely think that those are legitimate goals that he can accomplish.”
In order to play during the fall season in 2022, Wimberly will have to take the spring 2022 academic semester off and push his graduation back to December. During his time away from Harvard, he plans to live in Cambridge and work for a small law firm in Boston. Meanwhile, he intends to partake in unofficial throwing sessions with his teammates on campus, including Dean.
“I’m going to be doing a lot of work with Charlie over this spring semester, whenever I’m around, just getting those unofficial throwing sessions in,” he said. “After this semester, a lot of our work [will] definitely be done this summer, as summer dogs in training, so that is the plan, to get as many reps as possible.”
Along with sophomore wide receiver Kaedyn Odermann, who flashed plenty of talent before missing the last six games of his freshman season after suffering an injury, Wimberly will play a key role in a potent wide receiving corps for a hungry Harvard squad. With sure hands, speed, strength, and steady route-running, he offers a complement to Odermann’s vertical game. The six-foot-three Odermann came down with an impressive jump ball touchdown in the Oct. 2 victory over Holy Cross, and should return to full health for 2022. After the controversial loss to Princeton cost the Crimson a share of the 2021 Ivy League championship, Wimberly has circled the Tigers matchup on his calendar.
“Next year, we actually have to turn up,” he said. “So I think it’ll definitely be a bigger game, … so that is a big one in mind, is to beat [Princeton] outright.”
After the 2022 season, Wimberly will still have one season of football eligibility remaining, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He could opt to re-enter his name in the transfer portal and play out a postgraduate year at a different university. He considered schools closer to his hometown of New Orleans before ultimately choosing to return to Harvard, and playing for a Louisiana school would be near the top of his priority list if he were to enter the transfer portal again in the winter. Alternatively, he could decide to declare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Still, regardless of his path, Wimberly envisions himself playing football at the next level.
“Just having the opportunity to play in the NFL is great,” he said. “That’s something I’m going to do in the future.”

Coming off of a big win against No.3 Princeton, Harvard Women’s Squash (11-0, 6-0)  earned their No. 1 ranking in a 9-0 sweep against Amherst and a dominant 7-2 victory against Cornell. The victories improved the team’s record to 92-0 in the College Squash Association (CSA). The No.2 Men’s program (10-1, 5-1 Ivy) swept both Cornell and Amherst 9-0, raising its tally of clean sweeps to seven this season.
Brecon Welch, playing in the ninth spot, dispatched her Cornell opponent in straight sets, looking strong from the outset and never looking back. The first-year from Greenwich, Connecticut pulled out an 11-2, 11-6, 11-5 victory for the Crimson.
First-year Habiba El Dafrawy, sophomore Serena Daniel, junior Evie Coxon, and junior Charlotte Orcutt also won in straight sets for Harvard.
Orcutt managed the only 11-0 game of the match against Cornell’s McKenna Stoltz, whose brother Conner Stoltz is a first-semester sophomore on Harvard’s Men’s Squash team. Orcutt won her match 11-3, 11-2, 11-0.
“It was great to be able to have a family affair at the match. We grew up playing together so it’s super cool to now be playing together at the collegiate level, and to share friends across teams,” said Stoltz when asked about the dynamic that comes with playing against a sibling.
The momentum generated by commanding wins like Orcutt’s fueled the team as they took on their second opponent. Harvard didn’t drop a set against the Mammoths, scoring 27-0, with dominant match play like the straight-set win in exhibition by Harbour Woodward ‘24.
The Crimson maintained a strong victory margin throughout, with first-year Emma Carney winning 11-2, 11-3, 11-2 in the ninth spot, and junior Brittany Sun cleaning up 11-8, 11-4, 11-3 in the eighth position.
Coxon had a particularly strong showing throughout the play-day, losing just 26 points throughout both of her matches. She dropped the fewest points of any player competing in two matches that day.
“I was proud of how the team dealt with playing two matches on the same day. Amherst was our second match and we were still able to hold strong and beat them without dropping a set. I felt that the team was mentally tough and handled the pressure of playing two opponents really well,” El Dafrawy said.
Harvard now holds a 28-0 record against Cornell, and a 12-0 record against Amherst.
The men’s program also showed well this past weekend. The Crimson outscored Cornell 27-5, securing its twelfth consecutive win against the program; Harvard is now 51-2 all time against the Big Red.
Adam Corcoran had a particularly strong day, winning both of his matches. The senior lost only 16 total points between his two matches, and he boasted the only 11-0 game in his match against Cornell’s Charles Culhane.
Corcoran was far from the only Harvard player to produce a strong showing. Senior Victor Crouin, junior Marwan Tarek, senior Samuel Scherl, junior George Crowne and sophomore Ido Burstein also went 2-0 individually on the day.
Scherl and Corcoran’s wins in the third and fourth spots maintain Harvard’s undefeated record at the positions this season.
Playing once on the day, sophomore Conner Stoltz edged out a five-set match against his Cornell opponent, pulling off a 7-11, 11-7, 5-11, 11-7, 11-9 victory.
“Tate Harms and I both won our matches 11-9 in the fifth, as close as things can get, so I think there was some good energy surrounding those matches,” said Stoltz.
Carrying momentum from its showing against Cornell, the Crimson swept Amherst 27-0, recording its tenth win for the season. The victory marks the fifth consecutive season in which the team has earned double-digit wins.
Showcasing this strength was first-year Neel Joshi, who had a dominant match against his Mammoths challenger, pulling out an 11-4, 11-3, 11-4 victory in the seventh spot.
Harvard is now 50-0 all-time against Amherst.
Next, the men’s and women’s teams will travel to Trinity College on Friday to take on the No. 2 Bantams.

With the frigid temperatures making Shopping Week — I mean, the first week of classes — even less fun, classic fixtures of the Yard (re: dog-sized squirrels, most of the tourists, that one group of guys playing spikeball by Holworthy) have gone into hibernation, including our favorite source of controversy. No, not the foot or the hole in the ground, but the iconic, vibrant, exorbitantly-priced chairs.
The chairs were a 2009 addition from architect Fermob’s Luxembourg Collection. Although they’re priced at only $381 per chair (still a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a chair that could easily be replicated by Ikea), they must be purchased in pairs, bringing the sum to $700+ for just two.
While the chairs add a nice touch of modernity and a pop of color to Harvard’s traditional, old-white-man-with-a-white-colonial-wig, red-bricked undergraduate campus, here’s what else Harvard could have spent the $14,000+ on.
Whiteboards
Besides maintaining the Ivy League aesthetic, why does Harvard still have blackboards? Are we still in the ’80s? I feel like I’m six years old again drawing chalk butterflies on the pavement. There’s nothing like leaving class with white, powdery stains on your black pants that you accidentally wiped your hands on. You don’t want people to think you’re coming from a final club.
Pest Control
With cockroaches abounding in Canaday and rats galore in Eliot House, Harvard housing could use some serious pest control to keep these uninvited critters from making themselves at home within our walls and munching on our socks and snacks. We already have two freshmen in a room meant to be a single, and now we have to add a third roommate?
A New Toaster for Annenberg
The ancient, industrial-looking contraption desperately needs an upgrade. It never fails to tack an extra five minutes onto my already rushed Annenberg breakfast routine as I wait for my multigrain toast to be ready. It achieves the bare minimum of toasting only one side at a time, and the left dial is always broken. The yummy Annenberg peanut butter I spread on it somewhat makes up for its turtle-like speed.
Electric Scooters for Everyone
While the athletes zoom around, the rest of the student body is relegated to peasants on foot. Yeah, I might not have practice across the river twice a day, but it would sure make waking up ten minutes before class a lot easier.
Abolish All Private Property. Redistribute!
If Harvard dropped roughly $14,000 on the chairs, each student could’ve received $2 instead. It might not cover my peppermint latte from Starbucks (rip), but, gosh, do I want my money. You could use it to cover one load of laundry in the washing machine, with an extra $0.50 left over to put towards the dryer fee!
Although the $700 chairs served as a great place to socialize at the beginning of the semester, perhaps Harvard will consider some of the above before investing in expensive outdoor furniture. And if not, I certainly will not be keeping a chair for ransom in my dorm.
