After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There has been much speculation over whether or not “Shout Out to My Ex” by Little Mix is throwing shade at Zayn Malik, Perrie Edwards’s ex-boyfriend. It has not been confirmed if that conjecture is correct. Possibly more clues will be revealed in the rest of their new album, “Glory Days.” The British girl group’s latest single fits in with their musical niche—stylistically similar to previous singles such as “Wings,” “Black Magic,” and “Move,” which all have repetitive lyrics and fast-paced music.
“Shout Out to My Ex” is a catchy mainstream pop song. At first, it is entertaining because of the straightforward lyrics and the repetitive and danceable music. However, eventually it gets monotonous. The seventh refrain is the same as the previous six: “Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man / You made my heart break and that made me who I am / Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now, well, I / I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never bring me down.” These recurrent lyrics, along with the repetitive melody, weight the song down despite its lighthearted story about self-elevation in the face of a breakup and uncomplicated, upbeat music.
Overall, “Shout Out to My Ex” is a fun song. It is infuriatingly repetitive yet lighthearted—and possibly about Zayn Malik. It’s worth listening to simply to find out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent investigation by the Harvard Crimson revealed that in 2012, Harvard Men’s Soccer produced a “scouting report” on the freshman class of female soccer players. Members of the men’s soccer team wrote and circulated this report, which described freshman women in sexually explicit terms and assessed them on the basis of their appearance. Even worse, an investigation by Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel disclosed that the team has continued to produce such reports every year, including in 2016.
As members of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student organization dedicated to dismantling rape culture on campus, we are appalled but unfortunately not surprised by these revelations. The reports are indicative of a broader campus culture of male entitlement to women’s bodies, in which nearly one third of Harvard women are sexually assaulted during their time here. We first extend our sympathies to the women of Harvard’s soccer who have been treated in this appalling manner. Furthermore, while we are heartened by President Drew Faust’s decision to suspend the team, we continue to demand that the University demonstrate its genuine commitment to cultural change through further action, both punitive and preventative.
These reports cannot help but recall the tapes of Donald Trump bragging to Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women, kissing them without consent and “grabbing them by the pussy”. Both cases are troubling evidence of men refusing to hold each other accountable and instead bonding over the sexual objectification of women. Rather than shutting down this inappropriate conduct, for instance, one soccer player responded to the report by writing “hahahahaha well done.” Over the last four years, members of the team appear to have never questioned the practice, and it was not until after the team was suspended that current players came forward to apologize for their complicity. Evidently, male-dominated spaces create opportunities for discussions of women that would elsewhere be censored.
As the six members of the 2012 Harvard Women's Soccer class wrote, “having considered members of [the men’s team] our close friends for the past four years, we are beyond hurt to realize these individuals could encourage, silently observe, or participate in this kind of behavior, and for more than four years have neglected to apologize until this week.” It is frightening that men on the team maintained friendships with women players about whom they spoke and wrote in this extremely disrespectful manner. Unfortunately, this behavior reflects attitudes whose impacts are rarely limited to men-only spaces. Donald Trump does not only talk about sexually assaulting women; he faces numerous allegations of having actually done so. Similarly, sexual assault is pervasive on Harvard’s campus; it seems likely that the privileged social position of male athletes fosters this situation.
Part of our response to this revelation should be an increased skepticism about the role of male-only spaces on campus. Yet we should also work to change the standards of behavior within such spaces. We stand by the women’s soccer team in calling on men to hold each other accountable. We hope that the men’s soccer team was sincere in their pledge to “confront the issues of sexism and misogyny within our own locker room.” Meanwhile, we also call on Harvard to hold its student-athletes, who are often the public face of the university, to a higher standard of behavior.
In particular, the soccer team’s apology is appropriate, but should not grant them amnesty. In order to secure justice for the women mentioned in these reports and to demonstrate Harvard’s commitment to its sexual assault policy, the Title IX office and Ad Board should take significant punitive action against any individual students found to be complicit in the production of these reports. Such action would demonstrate that membership in a group does not excuse one’s actions, and encourage more students to hold their organizations accountable for traditions that are inconsistent with Harvard’s policies and values.
Additionally, the culture of male bonding over the sexual objectification of women, as seen in these reports, is more than sexist—it is an environment that normalizes sexual violence. We agree with Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise that “these things exist in our society” and therefore, most likely, on other Harvard sports teams. Already, recently released documents have exposed a similar practice on the men’s cross-country team. We therefore strongly recommend that Mr. Scalise make participation in Harvard sports conditional on sexual consent trainings (from CARE, OSAPR, or the Boston Rape Crisis Center, for instance) for all athletes. Such trainings would be a starting point for a broader cultural shift within Harvard male athletics.
This report is certainly symptomatic of larger problems, on campus and across the nation as a whole. Yet there is good reason to attend to this case as more than just a “valuable lesson” in what not to do. Our efforts to publicly condemn rape-enabling attitudes should start here, and now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m sitting in class, fixated on the robotic exercise of hammering away at my keyboard, when a notification pops up on the right side of the screen. It’s New York Times reporting on breaking news of a terrorist attack. My eye catches the name of my country, and, in that moment, I know I’m a click away from swallowing news of the deaths of many of my countrymen. For once, I understand why it’s called “breaking” news, because it does break me. The lecture proceeds without interruption while my distress proceeds to consume me. I half expect someone to raise their hand and announce to the room that a city was just severely wounded. After all, it is a government class. I hold myself in contempt as to why I couldn’t be that person. But, for once, I don’t want to be the only person who cares about this. I don’t want to be the bearer of news from that part of the world; the sole representative of news that is blatantly trivialized simply because it isn't part of the Western consciousness.
Still, walking out of class, I expect to hear murmurs about the devastating news, but I hear no concerns voiced. Surely, a room full of government concentrators have their ways of staying updated. I could not have been the only person who just "happened" to receive a notification, and also "happened" to be Pakistani. Naturally, in the moment, I am enraged and disoriented. Suddenly, Harvard does not, at all, seem the global community it claims itself to be.
The death toll in Pakistan rises every hour, but no one I encounter throughout my day at Harvard seems concerned. Of course, I consider the possibility that they are unaware of what is happening across the world, so I vehemently check, and double check, to see if the popular tabloids are reporting on what just happened in Quetta. Once again, I confirm that they are. Why, then, was everyone unfazed? The silence around me is disarming: I no longer know how to act or feel. I recall similar occurrences that involved other countries. I recall, too, the outrage at Harvard. I realize that none of it will be accorded to my people that, too, have been ravaged in a war against terrorism. I concede that their sacrifices will never provoke global outrage.
This is what all of Harvard ignored: on October 24, a terrorist attack on a police academy in Quetta, Pakistan, claimed at least 60 lives and left hundreds wounded. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. But, suddenly, ISIS was no longer relevant. No longer was it an international threat with growing influence.
I repeatedly share news on social media in the hopes that my peers will see it. I recurrently check my newsfeed to see if any member of the Harvard community has posted anything related. Nothing. I realize, later, that people just don’t care; when I try bringing it up at dinner, when I try mentioning it in section, no one wants to know or care about what happened on soil that is not theirs. I suppose Paris was closer to home. Maybe our foreign policy just isn’t that important. I check my mail frantically, on the lookout for something that offers support for those looking for it. I remember Hurricane Matthew prompted an email on the house list voicing concern for those who may have family and friends in the affected area. I anticipate a similar email but it never comes. Where’s the support for us? Why weren’t Pakistani students at Harvard asked if they were doing okay or if they had families in the area?
I feel isolated in my grief and concern. I think of my fellow internationals, who must be going through similar emotions. We offer each other words of comfort and marvel at the collective apathy of those that make up our institution. That the matter never made it into people’s conversations may have to do with an overarching trend of marginalizing the sufferings of the “third world” that we like to pretend barely exists. But there are students here that belong to these places who need support. Must I explain that these were real people with real families—even though they didn’t have French accents—that suffered at the hands of terrorism? Where is your War on Terror now? With the emphasis on political correctness here, I’m shocked that our community can be so ignorant and apathetic at times like these. Our selectiveness in embracing international issues only when the right countries are involved is disappointing.
If the College admits students from these parts of the world, it must also offer us support in trying times. International students are more than a statistic in your diversity report. We are not tokens that are to be cashed in for accessing different cultures. We are not here to teach Americans about our world; we, too, are here to learn. We are people from real places with real families. We, too, feel a sense of patriotism for our countries. When more than 60 people die back home, we should not feel alone in our grief and concern. And, definitely not at a place like Harvard that prides itself on being a global, informed institution.
I sincerely believe the Harvard community can do better. At the Fall Dinner hosted by the South Asian groups at Harvard, we observed a moment of silence for Quetta’s monumental loss. For the first time in two weeks, my feeling of disenfranchisement from Harvard thaws a bit. This small gesture didn’t do anything except acknowledge that there were, in fact, lives lost and families torn asunder. But, it is these small acts of solidarity that make our community strong.
If we take pride in our education of global leaders, we need to ask what “global” means for our community. Do we only have room to mourn for a global community that has veto power in the Security Council? I’m certain there are other severely bruised nations, with representatives on campus, that we can and must make space for. We didn’t afford Quetta that courtesy, and let’s hope there isn’t a next time, but if there is, I hope we can be a better global community for the entire world, from places remote to powerful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald J. Trump is now President-elect of the United States. This is a result none of us wished for. It’s a result none of us could have possibly imagined. And yet, on January 20, he will be our president.
After a divisive, hard-fought campaign that saw much of the world question American leadership and much of the American public question the quality of its leaders, the voters have spoken. While his victory is a sign of the extent to which we, as a nation, have yet to overcome our historic demons, it represents the will of the people and ought to be respected. Trump has won a clear victory, and should command the legitimacy of a democratically elected leader.
Now that he has been elected president, however, Trump must work to bring the many groups his campaign has derided and insulted into his vision of a strong, united country, while facing the consequences of his unacceptable and demeaning rhetoric. Though he won by appealing to those Americans who accepted or tolerated that rhetoric, he must govern for all Americans—even those that his words harmed.
We need not rehearse every vile, hateful, and unpatriotic comment that Trump made over the course of his campaign to emphasize that he has alienated large swathes of people who have long felt excluded from the promise of American democracy. It bears noting that even Representative Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House and a member of Trump’s own party, has described himself as “sickened by” Trump’s comments on women, and that Ryan called Trump’s comments about a Mexican-American judge a “textbook definition of a racist comment.”  African-Americans, Hispanics, women, LGBTQ Americans, Muslims, people with disabilities, immigrants, and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of this country have all drawn Trump’s ire for reasons that, at best, pass human comprehension, and that at worst indicate a cynical electoral strategy of appealing to the worst elements of American life.
We must now hope that the President-elect can work to undo the damage that his campaign has caused to the “bonds of affection” that Lincoln described as linking each American to their fellow citizens. Fundamentally, in his rhetoric, Trump must make clear that all those he targeted during his campaign are in fact vital components of our national fabric. Our generation is the most diverse in American history, and the ones after us will be even more so. This election, however, has proven that that demographic reality is not enough by itself to fight xenophobia and hatred—two of the recurring themes of Trump’s campaign speeches. Unfortunately, for members of Harvard’s campus and in the wider public, the success of this negative rhetoric could have deleterious effects on the mental health of women, people of color, and others. All Americans must attend to the ongoing exclusion of our fellow citizens from our social fabric and body politic. All must be able to participate fully in our republican experiment and our shared democratic traditions, even under a Trump administration.
In terms of specific policies, we hope that Trump rethinks his most unjust proposals, particularly on immigration, where he has called for mass deportations that would break up families, destroy communities, and hurt our economy. It should go without saying that ideas like banning Muslim immigration are racist to their core and ought never be considered; discrimination on the basis of religion or race is antithetical to the Constitution and our Framers’ vision of this nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Athletics Director has asked the Office of the General Counsel to review the men’s cross country team after The Crimson reported former men’s runners produced “sexually explicit” spreadsheets about members of the women’s team.
When The Crimson reported last month that the men’s soccer team had produced vulgar “scouting reports” about freshmen members of the women’s team, cross country captain Brandon E. Price ’17 informed Coach Jason S. Saretsky about the existence of the cross country’s team’s spreadsheets, according to correspondence obtained by The Crimson. 
Ahead of an annual dance every year with the women’s cross country team, members of the men’s team guessed which women would invite them and made comments about the women’s physical appearances in an online spreadsheet. While Price said Saturday he was “ashamed of” spreadsheets from past years, he said this year’s  spreadsheet did not contain lewd comments.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes Tuesday that Price had brought the existence of  the spreadsheets to his attention “in recent days.”
“Harvard Athletics will not tolerate this sort of demeaning and derogatory behavior,” Scalise wrote. “I have requested that Harvard University’s Office of the General Counsel look into the matter that the current men’s cross country team captain brought to our attention in recent days.
OGC also reviewed the men’s soccer team at the request of University president Drew G. Faust, and the University cancelled the rest of the team’s season last week. Scalise said  current members of the men’s soccer team were not “immediately forthcoming about their involvement” in the “scouting reports.”
“We don’t want the school to find this, without us first bringing it to them,” Price wrote to members of the men’s cross country team in an email Saturday. “The problem with the Men’s Soccer team was they tried to hide their stuff.”
Scalise also wrote in his email to student athletes that he had recently met with all coaches to “to reinforce that any behavior that runs counter to the values of the Harvard community is unacceptable.” The Athletics Department will “continue to educate” athletes about “appropriate social conduct,” according to Scalise.
“There is no place for disrespecting and objectifying one’s peers in our program. To whatever extent it has happened, it must stop immediately,” Saretsky wrote in an emailed statement Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While other students were standing in line at polling places around campus Tuesday, Kate S. Hoffman ’17 was boarding a plane in order to cast her vote.
Hoffman is one of several students who ran into issues while attempting to vote by absentee ballot in time for the 2016 Election. Students who did not receive their ballots were left with few options; some chose to travel home to vote while others were resigned to not voting at all.
Hoffman used TurboVote, a voter registration software that also helps with absentee ballots, to request her ballot. As Election Day approached and she still had not received her ballot, she said she called her county’s election commission office and was told she had not requested a ballot. After receiving the news, she made the decision to fly home to Dallas, Texas, to vote.
“I’m just really interested in leaving the world a better place than when I found it and I think that voting is an important way to do that,” Hoffman said from Dallas.
Michael F. Hissey ’18, a resident of Suffolk County in Long Island, applied for an absentee ballot in late September. When no ballot arrived, he said the elections commission referred him to the postal service. Hissey made the decision to travel back to New York for Election Day as well.
“I decided there was no way that I was not going to vote,” Hissey said from his home in Long Island. “I had actually been saving up some money to buy a coat and instead I ended up spending that money on an Amtrak ticket.”
Anna T. Weschler ’18, a supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, said she requested a New Jersey absentee ballot about three weeks before Election Day.
“I knew that was a little late, but I thought I would have enough time, but the ballot just came in the mail yesterday,” she said. Because she could not make the deadline to send in her ballot under New Jersey’s voting rules, Weschler resigned herself to not voting.
While registering to vote in Massachusetts is an option for students, many choose to vote absentee in their home states for a variety of reasons. For Hissey, it was a matter of perceived convenience, as he was already registered in New York.
Hoffman said she chose to register in Texas instead of Massachusetts because she felt that her vote could make a bigger difference in her home state.
“My political values are slightly different than the mainstream Texas political value, which is why I really wanted to go home to vote,” she said. “Especially being a woman from Texas, it was really important for me to make a difference that way."
Weschler expressed a similar sentiment about wanting her vote in her home state to make a difference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and scholars gathered Monday to hear Patricia Kennedy Grimsted, a senior research associate at Harvard’s Ukrainian Research Institute, discuss her research on art stolen by the Nazis and her attempts to track down works that remain unidentified.
Grimsted spoke about a collection of paintings that Erich Koch, a Nazi party leader, looted during World War II. Her research on the collection found that the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, has stored about 30 of these paintings, although she said the museum denied her access to the paintings. Grimsted said Hermitage administrators told her that they are currently restoring the paintings off-site.
“My aim right now is to try to find a way to get to see these paintings in the Hermitage,” Grimsted said in an interview. “If they’ve left them in the basement for 65 years, I don’t know what sort of condition they’re in.”
During the seminar in CGIS South, Grimsted spoke for nearly an hour about her research with looted and unidentified artwork. After Grimsted’s talk, she took questions from the audience and discussed her future research plans.
History professor Serhii Plokhii, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute, attended Grimsted’s seminar and lauded her research abilities.
“She is the woman who walks through the walls when it comes to all these bureaucratic and legal obstacles,” Plokhii said.
Kristina Conroy, communications director at the Ukrainian Research Institute, also praised Grimsted’s research accomplishments.
“Patricia Grimsted is very well respected,” Conroy said. “She’s gotten access to archives when very few people have been able to.”
Grimsted said she became interested in displaced art when the Soviet Union was breaking up, as she was living in Moscow at the time. The Koch collection project is just one of many on which she is working, she said.
Grimsted hopes to write a book on her findings, although she said she cannot publish her work until she identifies the paintings in the Hermitage.
In addition to writing about the the looted Koch collection, Grimsted will highlight the importance of uncovering displaced art in her book.
“One of the things I’m arguing is the need to identify more [paintings],” she said. “I’m only identifying 30.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The campaign for the presidency and vice presidency of the Harvard Undergraduate Council begins Wednesday, with four tickets vying for a chance to serve as the leaders of next year’s undergraduate governing body.
This year’s presidential candidates are:
- Scott Ely ’18, with running mate Evan M. Bonsall ’19
-  Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, with running mate Alex Popovski ’19
- Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, with running mate Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18
- Grant S. Solomon ’18, with running mate Alexander T. Moore ’18
Voting will be open for undergraduates next Monday Nov. 14 at noon through next Thursday Nov. 17 at noon, according to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
ELY AND BONSALL
Ely and Bonsall said their campaign focuses on four main areas: financial accessibility, sexual assault prevention, mental health, and promoting student voices. Ely, the current UC Education Committee Chair, is currently serving his third term on the Council. Bonsall, an Education Committee Vice Chair and Ely’s running mate, is currently serving his second term.
“We come from a place of experience in having gotten things done,” Ely said, pointing to his work on the College’s revamped General Education program and his push for programs of study for underrepresented groups.
Bonsall cited his work on the Freshman Class Committee improving brain break in Annenberg and advocating for the installation of laundry machines in Matthews Hall.
Ely and Bonsall said they hoped to reduce expenditures on textbooks through a book exchange program and institute a “bridge program” to help low-income or first-generation incoming freshmen learn about campus resources.
“First semester of freshman year was pretty rough for me, like it is for a lot of people coming from similar backgrounds,” Bonsall, a first-generation college student, said. “I think we should really be trying to do everything we can to make Harvard a place that's more accessible for people from all socioeconomic backgrounds.”
Among their other goals, Ely and Bonsall also said they plan to improve access to mental health resources, work with Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators to institute sexual assault prevention training in all Houses, and continue this year’s Grant for an Open Harvard College to encourage students to create more open social spaces.
Ely also said he and Bonsall opposed the College’s sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, which bar students beginning with the Class of 2021 from holding campus leadership positions or athletic captaincies and from receiving College-sponsored scholarships if they are members of final clubs or Greek organizations.
“We're going to stand against the sanctions,” Ely said. “There's a disconnect between the stated goals of the University and the policy that they're trying to implement.”
GONZALEZ AND POPOVSKI
Gonzalez and Popovski said their campaign emphasizes helping students feel ownership over campus, prioritizing “our spaces,” “our health,” and “our experiences” at Harvard.
Gonzalez, currently serving his third term on the UC, is the former Freshman Class Committee Chair and a current Education Committee Vice Chair. Popovski, currently serving his second term on the UC, is the Vice Chair of the Student Initiatives Committee.
To improve campus social spaces, Gonzalez and Popovski said they would seek to allow first-year students to book common rooms for social events, create fast track party forms in all Houses, and push to turn the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub into a club that could be “an attractive place for students to come party.”
Gonzalez and Popovski voiced support for the College’s policy on single-gender social organizations, though they acknowledged the issue is “highly nuanced” and criticized the lack of student input preceding the original announcement.
“Eduardo and I are in favor of the sanctions in principle,” Popovski said. “Women should absolutely have ownership and access to these spaces that have traditionally and institutionally been dominated by men.”
Gonzalez and Popovski also said they would advocate for more funding for peer counseling groups and work to integrate Counseling and Mental Health Services counselors and CARE representatives more closely with the Houses.
To improve student experiences on campus, Gonzalez and Popovski said they advocated for building an online textbook exchange service, requiring student organizations to publicize their comp processes when applying for College recognition, and creating an “academic bridge” program to allow incoming students from high schools with fewer resources to take some classes over the summer.
“The dream is that if you are fired up and ready to go to start your academic career on your own terms, you should be able to come in over the summer and have that essential first exposure to College that you're likely lacking if you come from an under-resourced high school,” Gonzalez said.
SACHEE AND KHANSARINIA
Sachee and Khansarinia said their campaign is based on three pillars: "arriving"—focused on programming and guidance for freshman, "vibing"—focused on improving social life, and "thriving"—focused on student life on campus.
Sachee is the current UC Student Relations Committee Chair and the former UC Secretary, and is serving her third term on the Council. Khansarinia, currently serving his second term on the Council, is the current UC Rules Committee Chair and former UC Parliamentarian.
Sachee and Khansarinia emphasized that their campaign will focus on practical and achievable goals, arguing that previous campaigns have focused on intangible ideas that the UC wasn’t able to follow through with.
“So often we have an infinite amount of conversations and town halls and task forces, but we never really take actionable steps,” Khansarinia said. “Our platform is a unique combination of actionable steps and tangible ideas that we can start working on our first day in office.”
Included in Sachee and Khansarinia’s campaign proposals are a “Q Guide for Comps” to make information about campus club comp processes more transparent, a textbook buyback program, and a partnership with the Harvard Alumni Association to pair alumni mentors with undergraduates.
Sachee and Khansarinia also said they plan to work closely with student groups on campus, both in creating a “multicultural cabinet” to address issues brought up by cultural organizations, and in student group-run bridge programs geared at helping freshmen adjust to life at the College.
“We, through our leadership on the UC, understand that the UC can't fix the bazillion issues that there are on this campus,” Sachee said. “We want to empower student groups that can.”
Sachee also said she hopes to institute mandatory annual sexual assault training for all undergraduates. Currently, freshmen undergo a mandatory workshop—and this year the College required students to participate in sexual assault prevention training modules—but Sachee said that annual training can help to reinforce values and remind students of parts of the workshop they may have forgotten.
“It is a big effort, but if this can prevent one sexual assault… it's worth it,” Sachee said.
SOLOMON AND MOORE
Solomon said he and Moore are campaigning on a platform to promote social inclusivity on campus. Solomon and Moore, who are both juniors and student athletes, are the only presidential and vice presidential candidates to have never previously served on the Council. Moore previously ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the UC as a Lowell House representative, and Solomon has never before made a bid for the UC.
Solomon said he felt that although lacking UC experience presented challenges, his ticket’s outsider status was an asset to the campaign. He argued that UC outsiders have the ability to offer fresh and creative ideas that the Council has not previously considered.
“I think we offer different ideas that people who have been in the UC might not see,” Solomon said. “In being student athletes, we touch on a big part of the community that represents a large part of the student body, and a lot of times their voices aren’t heard. There are issues that affect student athletes that would broadly affect the student body as a whole.”
Solomon said he and Moore would push for allowing alcohol in the Yard for those over 21, expanding Club 1636 to allow for more involvement with cultural groups, and establishing “sophomore re-orientation” programming to help sophomores get to know other students in their Houses.
Solomon also advocated for a program in which students from different campus groups would sign up to have meals together, with the goal of increasing exposure to students with different interests and perspectives. The program, Solomon said, would be similar to “TableTalk”—a program founded last year at the University of Pennsylvania that  invites students who “would not interact under ordinary circumstances” to meet and ask each other questions over a meal.
“After speaking with a bunch of folks in the leadership in different communities and seeing what changes they want to see on campus, they feel like they don't get enough face time with these other communities,” Solomon said.
VOTING
Consistent with previous UC elections, voting will take place entirely online, and will use the Hare-Clark voting system. Under the system, each voter may vote for more than one candidate, ranking their preferences in order. A ticket must receive a majority of votes to win, and a voter’s less preferred candidates will only be taken into consideration if their more preferred candidates have been eliminated.
Undergraduates will also be able to vote on three referendum questions: two concerning students’ opinions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and another asking whether students would support making the Harvard Turkey the official mascot of the University.
A presidential debate between the four tickets, hosted by The Crimson, will take place Friday at 7 p.m.
The newly elected president and vice president will take office at the start of next semester, taking over from current UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Along with overwhelmingly voting for Hillary Clinton for President, voters in Massachusetts opted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and denied a proposed lift in the state’s charter school cap.
Question 4, which will legalize the recreational use of marijuana, was approved by a slim margin and called late Tuesday night by the Boston Globe.
The new policy, which will take effect Dec. 15, legalizes the recreational use of marijuana for individuals age 21 and older. The lead in the election oscillated early in the night as votes came in, however “Yes” squeaked out a win as the hours got later.
Massachusetts joins Colorado, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington as states with legalize recreational marijuana. Four other states—California, Arizona, Maine and Nevada—also considered similar ballot proposals Tuesday.
While the results bode well for those who use the drug, Harvard and other universities around Massachusetts are unlikely to alter their current policies banning marijuana on campus.
The contentious Question 2, which would have increased the number of approvals for new or expanded charter schools to 12 per year at most, was soundly defeated by Massachusetts voters, the Boston Globe projected. The ballot proposition split Massachusetts Democrats, including the Harvard Democrats, and was originally projected to be far closer than what was reported.
The Harvard Democrats, while internally split, were officially in the “No” camp, and expressed excitement at the results late Tuesday night.
“I think that what we saw is simply a reflection of the underlying values that people in this state have,” the Harvard Democrats' point person on Question 2 Henry S. Atkins ’20 said. “All I can say is that I couldn’t be happier that we averted a public education disaster.”
On the other side of the measure were the Harvard Republicans, following suit with Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79.
“I’m disappointed,” Republican Club Treasurer W. Kent Haeffner ’18 said. “I think that the people who are going to be most disappointed though are the families of the 32,000 kids who are waitlisted.”
Haeffner partially attributed the defeat of Question 2 to Mass. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who came out strongly against the measure.
Also on the ballot this year were two questions regarding gambling and farm animal containment.
Question 1 and Question 3 did not receive nearly as much coverage as Questions 2 and 4. Massachusetts residents voted strongly to deny the state’s Gaming Commission to add one more slot-machine establishment in the state, the Boston Globe reported.
Question 3, which was backed heavily by animal rights groups, was approved overwhelmingly by Massachusetts residents according to the Boston Globe. The question would “prohibit any confinement of pigs, calves, and hens that prevents them from lying down, standing up, fully extending their limbs, or turning around freely.”

Hundreds of students cast their votes in Tuesday’s presidential election, but many said they were less than excited about the candidates on the ticket.
Voting booths were set up in two buildings on Harvard’s Cambridge campus: the Graduate School of Design’s Gund Hall and Quincy House. After polls closed at 8 p.m., the ballot-counting machines reported 599 individual votes cast at GSD and 436 cast in Quincy House.
For some students, Tuesday marked their first time voting in a presidential election. Matthew A. Weissman ’17 and Michael A. Cubeddu ’20, both first-time voters, said they found the experience of voting “exciting.”
“Now I have the famous sticker,” Cubeddu said, pointing to the “I Voted” sticker on his shirt, as he left Gund Hall after voting.
Many, however, said they were apathetic about voting for either of the two major party candidates: Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.
Kevin Blacutt ’20, who identifies as a Democrat, said he chose to vote for a third-party candidate because he was “disillusioned” with Clinton and said his vote was insignificant given that Massachusetts was likely to be called for Clinton anyway. Had he been registered in a swing state, he said, he would have voted for Clinton.
Blacutt added that he thought Clinton would win the race for the White House at the end of the night, which he termed “definitely better” than the alternative. Eighty-seven percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates said they would vote for Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, according to a survey The Crimson conducted last month.
Weismann also said he was lukewarm about the Democratic nominee. When asked how he felt about a Clinton presidency, Weismann replied that he would feel relief that “it’s not Trump.”
“But [a female president] is good as well,” he added.
As he exited Gund Hall Tuesday afternoon, Theodore N. Motzkin ’19 said he was “determined” rather than excited to cast his vote. He said he was unimpressed by both candidates and found the current political climate “demoralizing.”
“You just feel it, that people have lost a lot of faith in the political system to provide them with candidates that they really feel like they can get behind,” Motzkin said.
Other students disagreed. Raymond Cen ’17, who said he voted for Clinton, noted that, if social media was any guide, most of his friends at Harvard supported Clinton.
“I think people are really excited about the opportunity to elect the first female president in history,” he said. “I feel pretty good about it.”
Cubeddu and Law School student Alex Kochian echoed Cen’s sentiments in expressing admiration for Clinton. Kochian said she recalled reading Clinton’s biography when she was younger and thinking Clinton was “a powerful woman.” She added she would “feel great” if Clinton were elected.
When the clock hit 8 p.m. and voting officially closed state-wide, Winnie Williams, a voting official who spent the day distributing ballots at Gund Hall, paused for a moment to reflect on the difference between this presidential race and the one run between Barack Obama and John McCain in 2008. Williams, who also worked as a voting official in 2008, said she remembered an electric buzz that year.
“People aren’t excited now,” she said. “There’s a big difference because people now, they’re all so angry. That’s the best word for it, angry.”

Democrats maintained their majority in the Massachusetts State Legislature on Election Day, despite several tight races.
Before Tuesday’s election, Democrats had held of 126 of 160 state House seats and 34 of 40 state Senate seats. Twenty-five State Senate candidates and 117 State House candidates ran unopposed by a major party candidate, according to the State House News Service.
There were several legislative races in which the margin of victory was less than 20 percent as of press time. In the Cape and Islands Senate District, Democratic Julian A. Cyr defeated Republican Anthony E. Schiavi to earn the State Senate seat vacated by incumbent Democratic Senator Dan Wolf.
Following his victory, Cyr wrote in an emailed statement, “I intend to hold fast to the mantra that has sustained me through my campaign - that what seems impossible can actually be possible… I also want to congratulate each and every candidate in our region who ran a hard fought race.”
In the First Hampden and Hampshire Senate District, Democratic State Senator Eric P. Lesser '07 ran for the second time against Republican James “Chip” Harrington, who switched from Democrat to Republican in February 2016. The victory was called for Lesser, at 56 percent with 91 percent of precincts reporting.
In the 2nd Essex and Middlesex Senate District, Republican Susan M. Laplante challenged the incumbent Democrat Barbara A. L’Italien.

UPDATED: November 9, 2016, at 4:51 a.m.
Donald Trump has won the presidential election, capping off a divisive campaign that split the country and upended political norms after one of the most bitter races in modern history.
A string of victories in key battleground states gave Trump the election after an early-morning victory projection in Wisconsin pushed him over the 270 electoral votes required to be elected president.
Addressing a thunderous crowd in New York City after several news agencies called the election in his favor, Trump announced that Clinton had conceded the race to him and delivered a speech thanking Clinton for her years of public service.
“I’ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton, she congratulated us—it’s about us—on our victory,” Trump said. “And I congratulated her and her family on a very very hard-fought campaign.”
Trump’s victory speech sought to address wounds caused by a divisive 16-month campaign that saw further polarization of the American public.
“I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president of all Americans, and this is so important to me,” Trump said. “For those who have chosen not to support me in the past—of which there were a few people—I’m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help also that we can work together and unify our great country. 
Trump’s election Tuesday marks the end of an unprecedented campaign that began in June of 2015, when Trump, a businessman with no previous political experience, announced his intent to run for the presidency. The political outsider’s bid was defined by controversy and a strident deviation from campaign norms—when he launched his campaign, he called Mexicans rapists who were “bringing drugs” and crime to the United States.
His fiery controversial rhetoric continued throughout the campaign. Just last month, an Access Hollywood tape leaked to the Washington Post featured Trump making lewd comments about women and bragging about sexually harassing women.
“When you’re a star, they let you do it,” he was recorded saying.
Also in October, the New York Times published pages from Trump’s 1995 tax returns, in which he claimed a $916 million loss that could have allowed him to evade paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.
Much of Trump’s campaign was built on stoking fear among white working-class Americans that globalization and immigration were irreversibly harming the country, and that traditional politicians had proved unable to right the nation’s path. He proposed building a wall between the United States and Mexico and barring Muslim immigrants from entering the country.
On Harvard’s campus, Trump was met with widespread opposition. In August, the Harvard Republican Club announced that, for the  first time in their 128-year history, they would not support the Republican flagbearer. The group called him a “threat to the survival of the Republic.”
Only six percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates indicated they had planned to vote for Trump, according to The Crimson’s election survey published last month. In comparison, 87 percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates indicated they would support Clinton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 40 Harvard alumni won seats in Congress Tuesday night as both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives remained under Republican control and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, was elected the next President of the United States.
In the House of Representatives, more than 35 members in the next session will boast degrees from the University. Close to five alumni of Harvard’s various schools lost their races for seats in the House.
Of the eight Harvard alumni who vied for seats in the Senate, five won seats in Congress’s upper chamber.
While some polls had predicted Democrats could win control of the Senate in 2016, they lost several key races and the chamber will remain under Republican control. The vast majority of Harvard graduates ran and were elected as Democrats.
University President Drew G. Faust often meets with Harvard alumni who are elected officials when she travels to Washington, D.C., to lobby for public funding for universities, among other public policy issues that intersect with the University’s interests. Harvard alumni have historically been well represented in the governing bodies.
New York Senator Charles “Chuck” E. Schumer ’71, a Democrat and Harvard Law graduate, won his fourth term over Republican challenger Wendy Long, who attended the Law School for one year. Schumer will become the top-ranking Democrat in the next session of Congress after Harry Reid’s resignation.
Republican Senator Patrick J. Toomey ’84 eked out a close victory to keep his seat in Pennsylvania, while Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal ’67 also won his race in Connecticut. Law School graduate and Republican Senator Mike Crapo also successfully defended his seat in Idaho.
House Representative and Kennedy School graduate Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, won the Maryland Senate seat vacated by retiring Senator Barbara Mikulski.
Representatives from Massachusetts are particularly well connected to Harvard; four of the state’s nine Representatives attended one of Harvard’s 12 schools. Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, taught at Harvard Law School before she ran for Senate.
Kennedy School graduate and Democrat Katherine M. Clark won an uncontested race in Massachusetts’ 5th Congressional District, which includes Cambridge; Harvard alums and Massachusetts Democrats Joseph P. Kennedy III, Seth W. Moulton ’01, and Stephen F. Lynch also won seats in the House.
Besides Massachusetts, Michigan elected a relatively large number of Harvard alumni. The state elected three members of Congress with Harvard degrees: Republican John Moolenaar, Democrat Dan Kildee, and Democrat Sander Levin.
Not every Harvard graduate was successful on election night. In Wisconsin, Law School graduate and Democrat Russ Feingold lost his Senate challenge to incumbent Ron H. Johnson.

As the night wore on Tuesday with a Donald Trump presidency ever more likely, Harvard students watching the electoral results trickle in slowly grew silent. It seemed their overwhelming favorite for the nation’s highest office, Hillary Clinton, would not take the White House.
“I’d say it’s pretty stressful right now. Everyone is pretty stressed,” Amie Garcia ’19, who was watching the results of the presidential election results in Quincy House, said Tuesday night. “There’s a lot of hope, but that is slowly dying.”
Students crowded in dining halls, in dorms, and at the Institute of Politics on Election Day Tuesday evening to watch the long-awaited close of an unprecedented and divisive presidential campaign. The race was not called until about 2:30 a.m.—long after many watch parties had shut down—and Clinton conceded shortly thereafter.
The mood at the IOP’s JFK Jr. Forum, which opened at 8 p.m. for a campus-wide watch party, was initially celebratory, but that mood dampened as Trump gained momentum. The event ended at 12 a.m. without a balloon drop, which traditionally occurs regardless of an election’s outcome once a winner is announced.
Eighty-seven percent of surveyed Harvard students intended to vote for Clinton, according to a Crimson survey last month. And while students at Harvard tend to be more liberal, even the Harvard Republican Club declined to support their party’s standard-bearer for the first time in its history, calling him a “threat to the survival of the republic.”
In that Crimson survey, only six percent of respondents supported Trump.
“I hope that the next steps are reconciliation," said Declan P. Garvey ’17, the president of the Harvard Republican Club. “The next steps are, on both sides, after this divisive election that both sides need to.... come together as a country. I am unfortunately not optimistic that that is going to happen.”
Remington Hill ’20 said the the atmosphere at the IOP was “strangely calm”—though as the night drew on, some students were in tears.
“Interestingly I think there is not a sense of mass hysteria that I’ve experienced through my phone," Hill said. "I’ve had people calling me that aren’t here at the IOP or here in Massachusetts that seem a lot more upset than everyone here.".
In the Quincy House dining hall, students, realizing that Clinton may not win, began to do homework.
“I’d say it’s pretty tense in here...Tense is probably the best word,” Andrew R. Puopolo ’19 said while watching the livestream of election results. “It’s also a little relaxed—a lot of people are doing homework. I think people are slowly starting to realize that the election is not going the way a lot of people want it to.”
At a watch party for the freshman class held in Annenberg, students said the atmosphere felt tense and anxious.
“Honestly I feel like people are panicked,” Diana Wang ’20 said Tuesday night. “When Trump pulls forward, people freak. People just freak out.”
At 2 a.m. Wednesday, before the race was called, President of the Harvard Democrats Susan X. Wang ’17 said she and fellow students are “prepared to fight harder” following a Trump victory.

Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, a historic accomplishment for the Ivy League University. The Crimson was ahead of every single 2016 Final Four team and six of the eight Elite Eight teams—trailing only Kansas and Virginia. David Freed profiles each of the seven members of the class before they step on the floor for the season opener against Stanford, covering their recruiting process, playing style, and potential fit on this year’s team. In this one, he covers power forward Seth Towns.
Recruiting Process:
Of all the recruits, Seth Towns’ commitment was probably the largest shock. Towns rejected offers from Ohio State and Michigan, high majors that were looking at few of the other recruits, in order to come to Cambridge in early July, joining fellow four-star Chris Lewis, who had committed in January.
Towns offered some insight into the decision in a conversation with Bleacher Report, where he noted his desire to major in computer science and potentially work at Google if basketball doesn’t succeed. He called the decision a “no-brainer” and said that he thought the team was “on an unbelievable rise,” citing his trip to Crimson Madness at the beginning of the year as a big factor in the recruitment. Like many recruits, he was sold on one of Amaker’s central pitches—calling it “an opportunity for me to do something that nobody else will.”
Playing Style:
Towns has as complete and refined an offensive game as you typically see on a highlight tape. He averaged 32 points and 12 rebounds a game his senior year while breaking his high school’s record for points in a four-year career, a feat that is made that much more impressive by the fact that NBA first-round picks Jared Sullinger and Trey Burke attended his high school.
On his highlight tapes (see one here), you can see evidence of the varied game that Towns brings to the floor. While it is evident that he is playing against players who aren’t in the same league as him, he is able to both drive and shoot from around the floor. At the 0:45 mark, he breaks out a nice fadeaway shot after backing down a defender, something you rarely see from a high schooler.
Potential Fit:
Of all the rookies, it is easiest to get most excited about Towns next year. He tore up high school competition in Ohio and comes in right at a position of need for the Crimson. He is the best small forward prospect in the class and Harvard lacks an obvious starter at the position after the consecutive graduations of All-Ivy talents Wesley Saunders ’15 and Agunwa Okolie ’16.
Junior Andre Chatfield is the main competitor for the role, but he lacks the complete offensive game that Towns is able to bring to the table. After spending two years under Amaker, he will surely be a better defender, but Chatfield’s three-point shot is unsteady and his points this year largely came off broken plays and in transition. Towns, by contrast, has a more mature offensive game and the size to bother most Ivy League wings.
Who gets the starting nod between the two may simply come down to the rest of the starting lineup. The two surefire starters—returning seniors Siyani Chambers and Zena Edosomwan—are excellent defenders and decent offensive players. If Amaker slots in sophomore Corey Johnson at the two and a freshman (either Chris Lewis or Robert Baker) at the four, then he may opt for defense at the three to balance the lineup. If he takes junior Chris Egi at the four, he may opt for Towns to spread the floor and give Edosomwan and Chambers space to operate inside.

Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, a historic accomplishment for the Ivy League University. The Crimson was ahead of every single 2016 Final Four team and six of the eight Elite Eight teams—trailing only Kansas and Virginia. David Freed profiles each of the seven members of the class before they step on the floor for the season opener against Stanford, covering their recruiting process, playing style, and potential fit on this year’s team. In this one, he covers power forward Robert Baker Jr..
Recruiting Process:
Robert Baker Jr. was the recruit that took the recruiting class from good to great, signing in mid-August to give the Crimson an important boost after the earlier signings of four-star recruits Chris Lewis and Seth Towns. Baker noted in an interview with Scout.com that he was influenced by the other two four-stars that had been signed and previewed the signing of Patrick School guard Bryce Aiken by noting that “the coaches said they may bring in another really good point guard.”
Playing Style:
As a senior, Baker absolutely destroyed his competition to the tune of 21.6 points and 13 rebounds a game. He does this in a variety of ways. He gets to the free throw line nearly nine times a game and sinks the charity attempts at a 67 percent clip—a mediocre number that would have been sorely valued on this year’s Crimson squad. He doesn’t have great range from three but he is more than willing to shoot, having made a third of his attempts his senior year while taking more than three shots a game.
Inside is where he excels, collecting more than three offensive rebounds a game and making 50 percent of his shots in the paint. In this video, we can see Baker showing a variety of moves near the rim (including a nice face-up game) and some rim protection on the other side of the court. He had just as many blocks as fouls his senior year, something that bodes very well for his ability to contribute on the defensive end early in his Harvard career.
Potential Fit:
Baker has perhaps the highest upside of anyone in the class, but along with that comes a steeper learning curve. While he can do a bit of everything, he does not have a lot of polish to his game and comes in at the Crimson’s most crowded position. Like fellow freshman Chris Lewis, he will be competing with junior Chris Egi and sophomore Weisner Perez for the starting spot at the four.
Unfortunately for Baker, Lewis has more of the traditional game that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker favors. Amaker preaches an “inside-out” style of basketball that seems better suited to Lewis’ bruising style than Baker’s “stretch four” approach. If the Woodstock, Ga. Native can add strength and get into the post, he will have a strong case for minutes on the interior, but that may be a year down the road.

Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, a historic accomplishment for the Ivy League University. The Crimson was ahead of every single 2016 Final Four team and six of the eight Elite Eight teams—trailing only Kansas and Virginia. David Freed profiles each of the seven members of the class before they step on the floor for the season opener against Stanford, covering their recruiting process, playing style, and potential fit on this year’s team. In this one, he covers small forward Justin Bassey.
Recruiting Process:
Justin Bassey joined the team early in the recruiting process, coming in scarcely two months after fellow recruit Chris Lewis. His commitment came on the heels of Harvard’s NCAA Tournament loss to the UNC Tar Heels. According to USAToday, he was also considering Gonzaga and Vanderbilt when he made the decision.
Like many recruits, Bassey made the decision with education in mind. His two parents, who have six graduate degrees between them, put a heavy stress on academics and his father Morgan commented to USAToday that “education was everything for us.”
Playing Style:
Bassey has a retro game for a combo guard. He is above-average size for the position at 6’5” and uses that to attack the rim relentlessly. On highlight tapes here and here we can watch Bassey attacking the rim with aplomb, finishing around or above multiple defenders. He is adept with using both hands and runs the floor hard on every possession.
One thing that we do not see in either highlight tape is the outside shot. That said, Bassey is more than proficient from behind the arc, having made more than 40 percent of his attempts as a junior and senior while taking nearly six threes a game. However, his free throw percentage was disappointing (he made under 60 percent his senior year) and there remain questions about how his shooting will hold up at the collegiate level.
Potential Fit:
Bassey has an uncertain future in the Crimson rotation. His best skill—attacking the rim—was in high demand for the Crimson this year, who only had three perimeter players (sophomore Tommy McCarthy and seniors Patrick Steeves and Agunwa Okolie) who could do so with any sort of consistency. With Steeves and Okolie graduating, the Crimson will have a need for a slashing wing.
The problem is that fellow freshman Seth Towns looks to be more of that player than Bassey is. Towns has a better shot than Bassey, which will make it hard for the Aurora, Colorado native to see the floor. Junior Andre Chatfield, a defensive ace for the Crimson who lacks a solid set of offensive tools, will provide a different look and should rep substantial minutes at the position.
Overall, I expect Chatfield and Towns to duel for the starting small forward spot and for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker to play matchups as needed. Bassey will likely compete to get minutes behind those two and will have more success getting on the floor if he can refine his three-point shot.

Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, a historic accomplishment for the Ivy League University. The Crimson was ahead of every single 2016 Final Four team and six of the eight Elite Eight teams—trailing only Kansas and Virginia. David Freed profiles each of the seven members of the class before they step on the floor for the season opener against Stanford, covering their recruiting process, playing style, and potential fit on this year’s team. In this one, he covers center Henry Welsh.
Recruiting Process:
Welsh was the final addition to the Harvard class, signing in mid-October shortly after taking his official visit to the university. The then-high school senior had taken visits to both UC Irvine and Lehigh before coming to Harvard, which was looking for a true center to fill out a class heavy on power forwards and floor-spacers. The Los Angeles native was the second commit in the class to hail from Southern California (the other was Christian Juzang).
Playing Style:
Unlike the other recruits in his class, very few highlights exist of Welsh’s game. In the brief look we get at his game, he doesn’t look very different from the prototypical three-star freshman, flashing a solid game around the rim and accompanying it with some touch on the jump shot. Looking at his statistics from high school, it tells a very similar story—Welsh averaged 15 points and 11 rebounds a game his senior year, while doing very little ball handling (1.2 assists a game) and providing some rim protection (3.8 combined steals and blocks a contest).
Looking at brother Thomas Welsh, a sophomore at UCLA who broke onto the scene this year by nearly averaging a double-double in his second year of action, we can get a bit more of an indication of what Welsh might look like at Harvard. The older sibling will primarily attempt to take opponents in the post, having shot a grand total of zero threes during his first two years. He shot 59 percent inside the arc, which ranked sixth in the Pac-12 last year.
Potential Fit:
It is tough to think of how Welsh fits into the Harvard lineup this year. Senior Zena Edosomwan, a second-team All-Ivy contributor a year ago, will almost certainly be the starter for next year. Behind Edosomwan, the team does not have many big men to man the middle—junior Chris Egi is athletic but unpolished and had repeated foul trouble a year ago. Sophomore Balsa Dragovic is the tallest possible backup to Edosomwan, but got sparse minutes his rookie year.
The likely resolution is for Welsh and Dragovic to battle for minutes behind Edosomwan, although fellow freshmen Chris Lewis and Robert Baker may endeavor to steal those minutes from him. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has often had the great problem of having too many big men to play, and will likely have to manage his cadre of freshmen big men with care.

Recruiting Process:
Juzang had a quiet recruiting process, committing to join fellow rising freshman Chris Lewis last May. The senior from Calabasas, Calif. announced his commitment in early May via his Twitter account. Sophomore Tommy McCarthy, who hails from the same area of the country, congratulated Juzang on his commitment later the same day, calling the rookie his “lil bro.”
Playing Style:
Juzang’s highlights are certainly more impressive than ESPN’s scouting report gives him credit for (see here, here, and here). His three-point touch is streaky but the shot has a good rhythm to it. While he has a bit of a hitch at the beginning of his shot, taking it all the way down to his knees on each release, he has nice form on the finish. He does not appear to have a favorite spot from the floor, shooting from all around the arc.
The point guard’s tendency to launch bombs from deep offsets average two-point shooting (he made just 52 percent of his twos in high school, not an excellent number at that level). Juzang shot more than six threes a game as a senior, making 38 percent, and got to the line with ease, taking more than five free throws a contest. On the highlight tapes, he is more likely to cross over his defender and take a rhythm three than finish through contact under the rim.
Potential Fit:
Juzang is going to have a hard time crashing the rotation in his first year. He is the only two-star recruit in the class and received one of the worst grades (66 out of 100) from ESPN coming in. The ESPN scouting report on him calls him a “solid looking point guard for the low major level”, a far cry from the site’s description of Aiken (“a complete point guard that can run the team … He has a bright future as a high major guard”).
This is not to say that Juzang will not see the floor in four years. Senior Matt Fraschilla, who received similarly little acclaim coming out of Dallas’ Highland Park high school, was in line to receive the majority of the backup minutes earlier this year until he went down with an ACL injury. Alex Nesbitt ’15 played three years of backup point guard despite not being ranked as a high school senior. Amaker will seek to develop the shooting of the Calabasas native in practice, since an ability to knock down the three is the quickest way off the bench.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, a historic accomplishment for the Ivy League University. The Crimson was ahead of every single 2016 Final Four team and six of the eight Elite Eight teams—trailing only Kansas and Virginia. David Freed profiles each of the seven members of the class before they step on the floor for the season opener against Stanford, covering their recruiting process, playing style, and potential fit on this year’s team. In this one, he covers power forward Chris Lewis.
Recruiting Process:
Lewis was the first big recruit to commit to Harvard, having made his decision in January 2015. At the time, he was ranked 44th in his class, making him the highest-ranked recruit ever to commit to Harvard.
Although his decision made waves nationally—garnering coverage from the New York Times—Lewis’ hype started far earlier, when he received Division I offers as an eighth grader. He ultimately received offers from 15 different Division I schools before he decided to commit to the Crimson.
Yet, one of Harvard’s biggest competitors for Lewis was the school just across the river; as a prospective engineering student, he seriously considered playing for Division III MIT. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker admitted in a late-season interview that the ability of Harvard students to take classes across the river was a big selling point in the recruiting process.
Playing Style:
In the words of ESPN’s scouting report, “Lewis is a true power forward.” What that means is that Lewis likes to attack the rim and isn’t a stretch four in the model of Christian Webster ’13 or sophomore Weisner Perez, adept finishers around the basket who are comfortable launching from the perimeter. On his highlight tapes (see here and here), we can see Lewis viciously attacking the rim for dunk after dunk. He is able to get out in transition and finish effectively around the rim. Lewis is bigger than all his opponents in the video, something that will not hold true in college, but his athleticism and savvy around the rim is evident.
The major areas of development for Lewis, as the scouting report notes, are his low post game and his face-up game. The Alpharetta, Georgia native has not demonstrated a robust passing game, something that it took senior Zena Edosomwan—a similar prospect at age 18 and perhaps the best current comparsion on the roster for Lewis’ skill set—nearly three whole years to develop.
Lewis’ jump shot looks much better than Edosomwan’s did at his age, however. Around the one-minute mark of this video, we can see Lewis running pick-and-rolls with fellow freshman Bryce Aiken in which he pops out for elbow jumpers. Neither Edosomwan nor Evan Cummins ’16 was able to do this with regularity last year, and Lewis will add another dimension to the offense if he can do it consistently.
Potential Fit:
Lewis should compete immediately for a starting spot alongside Edosomwan. Amaker is reticent to start freshmen and will have to juggle the minutes of junior Chris Egi and fellow freshmen Robert Baker and Seth Towns along those of Lewis. Yet, the freshman looks like an immediate impact player on tape and has a more polished game than Egi. He is lucky to come into a rotation that is so thin behind Edosomwan, having been decimated by the graduation of three seniors who were the senior’s primary frontcourt partners a year ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class ranked No. 10 in the nation, a historic accomplishment for the Ivy League University. The Crimson was ahead of every single 2016 Final Four team and six of the eight Elite Eight teams—trailing only Kansas and Virginia. David Freed profiles each of the seven members of the class before they step on the floor for the season opener against Stanford, covering their recruiting process, playing style, and potential fit on this year’s team. In this one, he covers point guard Bryce Aiken.
Recruiting Process:
Aiken was the cherry on the top for Harvard, who nabbed the New Jersey alum near the end of the recruiting calendar when Aiken gave his verbal commitment shortly after visiting campus in October. The high school senior—who was also being pursued by Miami, Oklahoma, and Auburn—said that he chose Harvard “because it’s a unique opportunity” and “a once in a lifetime chance to be different and do something different.”
The speedy point guard said that he valued the work that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker had done at developing point guards. With the exception of sophomore Tommy McCarthy, each of Amaker’s last four main starting point guards (Jeremy Lin ’10, Oliver McNally ’12, Brandyn Curry ’13-’14, and Siyani Chambers ’16-’17) have all become All-Ivy talents.
Playing Style:
By looking through Aiken’s highlight reels (see here and here), you can see the similarities between him and the player he is often compared to—fellow Patrick School alumnus Kyrie Irving. The Cavs point guard is a mentor to the senior and once said that “I can tell he watches a lot of videos of me.”
Aiken has a filthy handle, frequently using an in-and-out dribble to move defenders out of his path. He is very calm on the court, and, like Irving, flashes a versatile offensive game. He is comfortable finishing at the rim with both hands and moves well on the perimeter. The other parts of his game aren’t as defined: while almost every pass in the video is a highlight that leads to a dunk, in high school he averaged under two assists a game—giving him the appearance of an Irving-like score-first point guard.
Aiken sharply resists the Kyrie comparisons: when asked about them, he responded that “I am looking forward to creating my own path. I want to be the first Bryce Aiken, not the first Kyrie Irving.” He does some different things in the videos—moving more without the ball than Irving, for example—but there is a decent degree of similarity in the two players’ games.
Potential Fit:
Aiken steps into an interesting position on the team. His playing style allows him to potentially play alongside either returning senior co-captains Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller, or sophomore Tommy McCarthy in two point guard lineups on the offensive end. However, perimeter defense is always a concern for Amaker, an NABC Defensive Player of the Year at Duke. Amaker expressed clear frustration with McCarthy’s inability to handle opposing point guards at the point of attack this year, and that will limit Aiken’s minutes.
The best guess is that Aiken will be compete with McCarthy to be the first guard off the bench to replace Chambers. Senior Matt Fraschilla, who is less talented but more experienced than the duo, may also be in the mix. Amaker historically is reticent to give freshmen big minutes, but Aiken is steadier than McCarthy, who was turnover-prone throughout the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the HBO hit series Game of Thrones, the most climactic episode in all six seasons has been the second to last. The ninth episode has always been the bloodiest, most exciting, and most important episode in the 10-episode seasons. Season six’s penultimate episode was highlighted by one of the most beautifully filmed battle scenes of all time.
Season three’s The Rains of Castamere killed off some of the show’s most important characters in the Red Wedding. The final episode in each season usually just describes the aftermath of whatever conflict or twist was introduced in show nine; hardly anything happens in terms of plot movement. The penultimate episode is the most significant.
Such is the case this weekend for the Harvard football team. While many parallels can be drawn between Game of Thrones and Ivy League football (the 10-episode seasons, a family in charge whose banner is red, surprising twists), the fact of the matter is that Harvard faces its greatest challenge this weekend against Penn, and the result of this game will more than likely determine the winner of the Ivy League championship. Heading into Friday, Harvard has a narrow lead in the conference standings. While the Crimson is undefeated, Penn lost its first Ancient Eight matchup last weekend against Princeton. As it stands now, Penn and Princeton are tied for second place in the Ivy League, each with one loss, which will make for an interesting weekend as Harvard takes on the Quakers.
And all of this has happened before. As in, it happened a year ago. Coming into the Penn game last season, the Crimson was undefeated in Ivy League play, and Penn had one loss. The Quakers’ defeat came at the hands of Dartmouth, whom Harvard had already defeated, 14-13, thanks to a crazy fourth quarter comeback in October. But the Crimson lost to Penn, meaning the Ivy League championship was split among the three teams.
So for the second year in a row, the penultimate game against the University of Pennsylvania is the most important. For the second year in a row, Harvard controls its own destiny. For the second year in a row, a win against Penn would almost guarantee the Crimson an Ivy League title.
Harvard has been markedly inconsistent this season. At points, the Crimson has clicked on all cylinders. The passing game has been complimented by the dual-pronged rushing attack of senior quarterback Joe Viviano and junior running back Semar Smith. Viviano has been able to light up defenses, hitting throws in the tightest of windows. The holes created by the offensive line are big enough for a truck to drive through, and Viviano has all the time in the world in the pocket. The defense has, at times, looked impenetrable. The defense is ranked third in the Ivy League in both yards and points per game. Sophomore defensive end DJ Bailey is tied for second in the Ancient Eight with six sacks. The team has, for the greater part of the season, looked like the best team in the Ivy League.
Other times however, the offensive line has given up six sacks in a single game—that happened against Holy Cross, the same team that held Harvard to a lousy 26 rushing yards. The Crimson also has not outscored a single team in the fourth quarter this season.
Penn’s been a different story. Judging by conference games alone—until last week, that is—Penn made an even stronger case as the top team in the Ivy League. After losing their first two nonconference games, the Quakers quickly rattled off five straight victories, four coming against league opponents. They beat Dartmouth by two scores and outscored Yale and Columbia by a combined 63 points. Three-year starter and first team All-Ivy quarterback Alek Torgersen had been lighting up defenses, throwing a league-leading 14 touchdowns and only two interceptions. The ground game had also been on fire, and the defense had been solid.
Last week, however, the Quakers looked like a completely different team against Princeton. Torgersen threw for only 179 yards and an interception. He also fumbled three times, losing one. Running back Tre Solomon, who leads the league in yards per game, was held to 38 yards on the day. Princeton dominated Penn, plain and simple.
The game this weekend, and in turn, the Ivy League, will be decided by which teams decide to show up. Harvard can play like it has throughout a good chunk of the season, or the team can play like it did against Holy Cross. The former guarantees a fourth Ivy League championship in as many years. The latter paves the way for the second three-way tie in a row.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI— When the Harvard men’s basketball team goes on a road trip, it usually boards a bus and drives at most a few hours. However, for this particular road exhibition, the team had to travel for nearly a full day by plane.
The Crimson is in Shanghai as part of the Pac-12 Global Initiative, described as “an effort to promote goodwill and showcase the Pac-12 and its member institutions around the world through student-athlete exchanges and sports.”
While classmates and family members in the US were just going to bed after learning the results of the 2016 presidential election early Wednesday morning, the Crimson took on the Federation University Sports China club basketball team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in the 5th Annual U.S.-China Men’s Basketball Friendship Game. Harvard defeated Shanghai Jiao Tong, 84-64, in the exhibition.
The exhibition contest marked one portion of a week of cultural and basketball activities for the Harvard team across Shanghai, culminating in the official season opener on Saturday against Stanford. The team started the week in Hangzhou, where it visited the campus of the Alibaba Group, which sponsors the Pac-12 Global Initiative contest, as well as several other cultural visits.
Sophomore guard Corey Johnson paced the Crimson with 17 points on 6-of-8 shooting, including 5-of-7 from deep.
“It’s nice to see the ball go in for him,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He needed that after struggling with being in foul trouble.”
While Johnson was dominating behind the arc, Shanghai Jiao Tong struggled to defend the paint as well. Senior forward Zena Edosomwan tallied 13 points in 20 minutes on the floor, including several monstrous fast-break dunks.  Junior forward Chris Egi added 12 points of his own as he takes on a more commanding presence in the lineup with two years of collegiate play under his belt. Amaker plans his offense around the inside-out system, in which he uses three-point shooting to spread the defense and create space for players in the paint.
The Crimson was most dominant during the second quarter when the team went on a 13-0 run to begin the frame. Harvard finished the first quarter up only four points, but ended the second frame up 17. Defense and speed spurred this offensive breakthrough, as Shanghai Jiao Tong couldn’t run the floor with Harvard.
While the Crimson led nearly the entire game, the fans at Shanghai Jiao Tong Gymnasium roared at every basket by the home team.
Despite the dominant victory, the Crimson still showed areas in need of improvement. Co-captain Siyani Chambers noted that because of the youth of the team, it still has to work on its chemistry and communication. Wednesday’s game marked just the second time that the team played together in front of a crowd.
“We made a small step today,” Chambers said. “I think we played a little better today than we did against MIT and that’s one of our goals, to get better every day and I think we got a little bit better today.”
All eyes have been on the rookies since they first put on their crimson jerseys, as Harvard owns the 10th-best recruiting class in the nation. While Bryce Aiken and Chris Lewis are expected to contribute early, it was freshman forward Henry Welsh who shone brightest of the freshman on Wednesday. Welsh notched 10 points in 14 minutes, shooting 5-of-6 from the floor. Though many of his baskets came in open space or on cleanup duty from teammates’ misses, Welsh showed a calm presence in the paint as a rookie, unlike Edosomwan who was described as jumpy during his first years in Cambridge.
“I thought Henry played really well,” Amaker said. “Really, really smart and solid and you know just kind of knowing who he is, which is a big step for a freshman, so I was pleased.”
The team heads to Shanghai Disney tomorrow where the Harvard and Stanford players will be the Grand Marshalls of the Disney parade.
“It’s really exciting how people respond to the Harvard brand and the Stanford and to be able to bring that to China is surreal,” Edosomwan said.
