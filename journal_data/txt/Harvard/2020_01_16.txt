After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jay Roach’s “Bombshell” seeks to tell the ambitious story of three women involved in a groundbreaking sexual harassment case, inspired by the 2016 Fox News sexual harassment scandal involving then-CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). If the movie was going for an explosion, however, the result was more along the lines of a small fire. While the film features several compelling performances and competent worldbuilding, it is burdened by its pacing and incomplete character arcs.
Roach adapts a documentary style storytelling approach with voiceovers and direct-to-camera shots where the female leads Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), and Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) break the fourth wall to address the audience. These shots sets a blunt and direct tone for the film from the beginning, as Megyn explains the power structure of the network. This dramatization is further grounded in reality by including media clips from 2016, which depict the world’s reaction to one of the most significant sexual harassment stories in entertainment.
At the core of “Bombshell” lies themes of journalism and stories, including accusations, rumors, and suspicions, which help render the toxic workplace at Fox believable. Other persistent motifs include scrutiny, both from the public and others in the office, the similar appearances of nearly all the female characters, and an emphasis on closing doors, which all establish an oppressive and anxious atmosphere as the film’s strongest point.
But the film fails to deliver on the most critical part: doing justice to the stories of the women embroiled in the scandal and harassment. “Bombshell” bites off more than it can chew by trying to highlight three separate stories with Megyn, the star anchor, Gretchen, the woman who sues Roger first, and Kayla, a fictional young journalist Roger harasses. Each of these characters’ arcs could easily support a feature film on its own, but with a divided spotlight, none of them feel as fleshed out or as complete as they deserve to be. Confusing pacing choices contribute to this issue: News of the accusation and the investigation don’t occur until well into the movie, after too much time is spent on establishing each character’s situation and Megyn’s ‘feud’ with Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. These pacing choices make the development and resolution of the investigation, and each character’s response to the accusations against Roger feels rushed, and thus ingenuine.
Given the limited time the film had to tell so many stories, the focus on Roger’s perspective was another problematic choice. Roger is painted as an aggressive, sexist predator from the beginning, yet many scenes depict Roger’s staunch insistence of his innocence. He’s deeply convinced that he never pushed women to do anything they didn’t want to do and that he never hurt them because of the benefit he gave to their careers. It is a difficult attitude to believe, even though his wife and (female) lawyer seem to accept it completely. While it’s important to tell everyone’s side of the story, the effect essentially paints Roger as a victim despite his decades of destructive behavior. In particular, the scene where the Murdoch family abruptly fires him and refuses to stand by him, suddenly pushing Roger from his empire, depicts him as a frail and defeated old man instead of an abuser who got less punishment than he deserved.
“Bombshell” makes a clear effort to give a nuanced look into the complex story of Fox News and the sexual harassment claims that brought down one of the most powerful men in the industry. But failures in the plot development and problematic depictions of Roger Ailes prevent the film from hitting its mark.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…
A director has a vision! Despite overwhelming odds, that vision becomes a film. And in spite of dozens of studios and executives proclaiming the poor quality of the film at initial screenings, “Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope” becomes universally loved, sparking one of the greatest film series of all time. Now, 42 years and eight films later, the Skywalker saga comes to an end with J.J. Abrams’ “Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.” But contrary to its title, this final film feels more like a confirmation of Star Wars’ downfall than its rise. As “The Rise of Skywalker” brings the series to a close, it is obvious that the passion and creative vision that George Lucas brought to the films has been diluted. Despite the film’s many flaws, Abrams does manage to piece together an entertaining narrative. Unfortunately, “The Rise of Skywalker’s” mistakes are so apparent and avoidable that it's frustrating seeing how much better of a film it could have been.
Some time has passed since Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) sacrificed his life to save the dwindling Resistance forces from Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and his vengeful First Order. The fragile situation has been shaken by the reappearance of an old enemy, the dreaded Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Armed with a legion of Star Destroyers, Palpatine possesses enough power to seize ultimate, irreversible control over the galaxy. Upon meeting Kylo Ren, the Emperor gives him a new task: Find and kill Rey (Daisy Ridley). Possessing a new set of Jedi skills, Rey and her friends, former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), Resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), set out to stop Kylo Ren and the Emperor, bringing peace back to the galaxy.
Abrams is quite zealous with how much information, subplots, and diversions he tries to pack into two and a half hours. However, despite its perhaps excessive ambitiousness, the film does a number of things very well. First, it nails nostalgia for the original trilogy. The “Rise of Skywalker” has been criticized for catering too much to the whims of fans through blatant callbacks to the original trilogy. While it is true that Disney’s sequel trilogy is Star Wars for a new generation, and uninspired repetition of plot lines from Lucas’s films would be tiresome, filmmakers should still keep these newer films true to the charm of the Lucas trilogies that came before. Through the reemergence of similar themes, enemies, and character goals, “Episode IX” is the first in the string of new Star Wars films to truly feel like a logical continuation of what came before, while still providing something new for the next generation of Star Wars fans to call their own.
Additionally, the spectacle of the film provides strong entertainment value. Though a film's flashiness does not necessarily mean that it is good, Star Wars has always been larger than life, filled with space battles, lightsaber duels, and breathtaking scenic environments. “The Rise of Skywalker” is no exception. The setpieces and environments are beautiful to look at, and they ground the narrative in a living, vibrant world. The scenes that take place around the ruins of the Death Star are phenomenal, as are those involving the Force link between Rey and Kylo Ren. Though the cinematography occasionally struggles to keep up with the action in some of the busier scenes, it otherwise does a good job of organizing the chaos, keeping the most important things in focus amid the noise of the battles.
But spectacle alone is not enough to hold viewers’ attentions. Dramatic tension is key to making adventure films effective. This is where “The Rise of Skywalker” falters the most. While the beginning of the film is extremely effective at establishing stakes by showcasing Palpatine’s return, this tension rapidly dissipates as the movie consistently demonstrates its unwillingness to take risks or commit to its creative decisions. Characters are constantly placed in harm’s way, but they always manage to concoct an escape despite overwhelming odds, ultimately diminishing emotionally resonant moments. This trope occurs so frequently that by the end of the film, it's hard to believe anything that one is being shown. Without dramatic tension, all action scenes are reduced to little more than glorified light shows, which is disappointing considering the technical impressiveness of these scenes.
Furthermore, the film squanders many characters that could otherwise have been highly compelling. In “Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens” audiences were shown glimpses of the Knights of Ren, elite Force-sensitive warriors at the command of Kylo Ren, who could have proved deadly enemies for Rey and her friends. However, in “The Rise of Skywalker,” they act as little more than glorified bodyguards with little bearing on the story.
Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) is similarly wasted. Rose had a rather large part in Rian Johnson’s “Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,” but Tran was viciously bullied over social media following the film’s release. Admittedly, her part in “The Last Jedi” was poorly written, but rather than creating a unique, rewarding character arc for her in “The Rise of Skywalker,” her character is almost entirely removed.
Nowhere is wasted potential more obvious than with Finn, who was established in “The Force Awakens” as a primary character — a rogue stormtrooper, the first to wield a lightsaber, and a crucial player in the Resistance. However, in “The Rise of Skywalker,” he is unforgivably presented as more of a side character whose only real contribution appears to be inserting himself in the middle of dramatic scenes and shouting “REY!”
Additionally, there are many small issues that combine to create an uneven viewing experience. The humour, though occasionally welcome, is often misplaced. Repeating a joke three times in quick succession does not make it funnier, especially when it interrupts an otherwise interesting moment. Rey conveniently develops powers that previous films have explained as extremely difficult or impossible, and the film's glossed-over justifications feel largely unearned. Lastly, the final showdown feels a bit lackluster for the concluding event of the Skywalker Saga.
“Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker” is the final chapter in the 42-year-long Star Wars journey. Though its errors and missed opportunities are many, and it is clear how the journey could have been improved, the “Rise of Skywalker” should still be applauded for what it manages to achieve. Abrams manages to bring back some of what made the original trilogy great, fixes many issues created by the previous installment, and concludes one of the greatest franchises of all time in a way that most people will accept, if not love. Considering the unbelievably high expectations for the film, this is pretty much all that anyone could ask.

“Uncut Gems” is a movie about control. Howard Ratner, played brilliantly by Adam Sandler, is a New York City jeweler with a severe gambling problem whose life painfully unravels despite his desperate attempts to fix it. This film is not a cautionary tale, nor is it a story of redemption — it is a portrait of one man’s steady, irrevocable loss of power.
Even as he cries, begs, and screams on screen, Ratner does little to engender sympathy from the audience because it is hard to attribute blame for his struggles to anybody other than himself. His slimy appearance, gratuitous cursing, and apparent disdain for his responsibilities as a father cast him in an immediately unlikeable light. Nonetheless, it hurts to watch power being wrested from his hapless hands at every turn. The experience of watching “Uncut Gems” is one of relentless, visceral discomfort.
The movie follows Ratner as he attempts to pay back his gambling debt by selling the titular “uncut gem” that he sources from Jews in Ethiopia; his primary setbacks arise because each time he gets lucky and makes some money, he turns around and places yet another bet. Among its many strengths, the film succeeds as an exploration of addiction. As Ratner squanders chance after chance for redemption by relapsing into gambling, his nerves become increasingly fraught and his eventual downfall feels more and more inevitable. Through the very experience of watching Ratner’s fleeting highs and relentless lows, the audience is made to understand the frenetic, frustrating nature of gambling addiction.
Nearly every other character in the film takes power away from Ratner at one point or another. Debt collectors pursue him and threaten him with physical violence throughout the film. NBA player Kevin Garnett (playing himself) borrows his valuable Ethiopian gem for a little bit longer than he was supposed to. Ratner’s young employee Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) holds power over him because he single handedly brings Ratner a large portion of his clientele (including Garnett). His wife (Idina Menzel) exerts her own power over her husband by demanding a divorce despite his protests. Even R&B artist The Weeknd makes a brief cameo in which he temporarily tempts Ratner’s younger mistress away from him at a performance.
The film revels in its portrayal of human cataclysm. Audiences bear witness to shocking violence, crippling addiction, a crumbling marriage, disappointed children, misogyny, antisemitism, and pure humiliation. Nearly every scene brings with it a new conflict, very few of which achieve any satisfying resolution. Ratner is impossible to root for, but his unmistakably human flaws make him too pitiful and, frankly, too alarmingly relatable to dismiss. “Everything I do is not going right,” he sobs to his mistress Julia, expressing a painful, universal sentiment of powerlessness. Ratner embodies some of our worst tendencies as people, but the very fact that we can recognize some of those very tendencies in our own actions makes his demise all the more upsetting.
The only element that prevents “Uncut Gems” from descending into absolute chaos is the impressive control displayed by the film’s cast and crew. Directors Josh and Benny Safdie do an excellent job of creating the film's opulent-but-grimy aesthetic and managing its relentless pacing. Virtually every cast member gives an incredible performance. Sandler, in particular, plays the role of Howard Ratner in full command of his talents. He has played many lovable goofballs throughout his long career in light-hearted comedies and rom-coms; here, he plays a repulsive goofball in a gritty thriller with impressive authenticity. Newcomers and relative amateurs give equally commendable performances, from Julia Fox making her film debut as Sandler’s needy but genuinely caring mistress to LaKeith Stanfield brilliantly playing a role totally unlike the one on FX’s “Atlanta” that catapulted him into the spotlight. Even Kevin Garnett, unlike many of his NBA peers, is legitimately convincing as an actor.
"Uncut Gems" comes at the dawn of our very own roaring 20’s, and the Safdies’ dark portrayal of greed and excess offers a fresh commentary on the consequences of those vices. However, instead of exposing the flaws in the classic vision of the American Dream, “Uncut Gems” focuses on the aimlessness of luxury. Ratner lives more than comfortably, with a beautiful family, a beautiful home, and a steady job. It is his own addiction-fueled discontent that renders his livelihood so fragile. While characters like Jay Gatsby personified a great American striving, Howard Ratner embodies a great American dissatisfaction: a phenomenon unique, perhaps, to wealth in the 21st century.

The Cambridge City Council unanimously approved a measure to ban the use of facial recognition technology in a 9-0 vote Monday night.
Following the lead of Brookline, Northampton, and Somerville, Cambridge is the fourth city in Massachusetts to restrict the use of facial recognition technology.
Cambridge’s new measure prohibits city departments from accessing or using facial recognition technology and information obtained from the software. Previously, a 2018 ordinance allowed Cambridge officials to use biometric or facial recognition technology with the City Council’s approval.
Face surveillance systems use facial recognition technology to analyze images of human faces. This information is then used to identify, monitor, and track people without their knowledge or consent.
While supporters say facial recognition technologies enhance safety and security, critics of facial surveillance argue that current privacy laws are not equipped to regulate the evolving technology and that the inconsistency and inaccuracy of facial recognition endangers residents.
“Cambridge joins a small but growing number of cities who are stepping up to protect residents from intrusive and undemocratic technology,” Cambridge City Councilor and former mayor Marc C. McGovern wrote in a tweet on Monday.
McGovern, who proposed the measure in late July, also thanked the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts for their support in passing the ban.
The ACLU — which has supported efforts to restrict facial surveillance in Cambridge, Somerville, San Francisco, and Oakland — has argued that facial recognition technology promotes racial disparities and biases. Its Massachusetts arm launched the Press Pause on Face Surveillance campaign to educate the public on the civil liberties concerns that it alleges facial recognition technology presents.
According to the ACLU of Massachusetts’s website, “face surveillance technology poses unprecedented threats to privacy, free speech, and racial and gender justice.”
“Studies including those done in Cambridge at MIT have shown the technology is highly inaccurate when evaluating the faces of Black women, with inaccuracy rates of up to 35 percent for that demographic,” the website states.
A similar bill before the Massachusetts State House seeks to regulate facial recognition technology statewide.
“Face recognition technology has a history of being far less accurate in identifying the faces of women, young people, and dark skinned people,” the bill reads. “Such inaccuracies lead to harmful ‘false positive’ identifications.”
If passed, the bill would establish a moratorium on face recognition and other remote biometric surveillance systems, making Cambridge’s ban on facial recognition technology the new norm in Massachusetts.

Alta Mauro will serve as the new Associate Dean of Students for Inclusion and Belonging at the College beginning May 1, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced in an email Wednesday.
Mauro will direct the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion team within the Dean of Students Office. In that capacity, she will oversee the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Office of Diversity Education and Support, the College’s Title IX Office, and the Women’s Center, as well as the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, which merged with EDI in February 2019.
O’Dair wrote in the press release that Mauro will bring both “deep expertise” and “passion” to the College.
“She will provide strategy and vision for an office that both serves students of today and orients toward the future, ensuring that programs and services are responsive to the changing demographics and needs of the Harvard College student body,” O’Dair wrote.
Mauro currently serves as the assistant dean of students and founding director of Spiritual Life and Intercultural Education at New York University, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. There, she heads institutional efforts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion and the “intercultural competence” of university affiliates, according to the press release. In 2016, she vied to serve as Cornell’s dean of students, though she did not ultimately win the position.
Mauro’s professional work has centered on promoting “sustained” intercultural dialogue, “culturally-relevant” pedagogy, and EDI capacity-building across student affairs functions, per the release. A speaker and published author, she has presented at numerous conferences and written extensively about issues related to global education.
The search for the new dean began in February 2019, months after former Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis stepped down for “personal reasons” in September 2018. Mauro will succeed Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller, who served as interim dean after Davis's departure.
Miller wrote in an emailed statement that he looks forward to Mauro's tenure.
“I am excited to welcome Dr. Mauro to our team. I am also proud of the great work the EDI team has been able to accomplish over the past 18 months. I am also looking forward to working with the EDI team and students to prepare for Dean Mauro’s arrival,” he wrote.

Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig filed a lawsuit against the New York Times Monday after the newspaper published an article suggesting that Lessig was defending the practice of accepting secret donations from deceased sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.
In a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court, Lessig accused the Times of publishing a “false and defamatory” story with a headline and lede that served as “clickbait.”
The New York Times story, titled “A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money, Do It in Secret,” was based on a September 8 Medium post by Lessig in which he explained his decision to sign a petition in support of Joichi “Joi” Ito, who resigned as head of the MIT Media Lab in September after the New Yorker reported that the lab had taken steps to cover up its relationship with Epstein.
Ito, who is friends with Lessig, also left his role at Harvard as a visiting professor.
“In the title and the lede to the article the Times published, they asserted facts which are completely contrary — indeed the opposite — to what the essay that they referred to said,” Lessig said in an interview with The Crimson on Wednesday.
In his September Medium post, Lessig argued that there are four types of donors to institutions. He wrote that benefactors can range from “Type 1,” donors “who are wealthy and whose wealth comes from nothing but doing good,” to “Type 4” donors — “people whose wealth comes from clearly wrongful or harmful or immoral behavior.”
Lessig argued in the post that Epstein — who officials say committed suicide in his jail cell in August while awaiting trial for allegedly running an underaged sex ring — was a “Type 3” donor, someone who is a criminal, “but whose wealth does not derive from their crime.”
“IF you are going to take type 3 money, then you should only take it anonymously. And if you take it anonymously, then obviously you will take the many steps detailed by Farrow to keep it secret,” Lessig wrote.
Lessig clarified in an addendum that he does not support universities accepting “Type 3” money.
Later in the Medium post, Lessig wrote that Epstein’s contributions to the MIT Media Lab were “a ticking time bomb” due to the “substantial pain to the people within the Media Lab who would come to see that they were supported in part by the gift of a pedophile.”
“He should not have brought this time bomb within the walls of the Media Lab,” Lessig wrote.
Lessig clarified to The Crimson that he believes “it was wrong for Joi to take money from Epstein, even if, as MIT directed, he took it anonymously.”
“The money from Epstein should never be taken, even if you take it anonymously because the very risk of it being exposed is reason enough to keep it out of the university,” Lessig said. “If it is exposed, which it’s pretty unlikely it would never be exposed, it would cause real harm to the women who have suffered abuse and to victims of Jeffery Epstein directly.”
“So because of that risk, it was wrong to take money from Epstein, even if anonymous,” he added.
Lessig said that he takes issue with the Times’ lede paragraph, which he called “both false and defamatory.” The paragraph reads, “It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, New York Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy said that the newspaper plans “to defend against the claim vigorously.”
“Senior editors reviewed the story after Professor Lessig complained and were satisfied that the story accurately reflected his statements,” Murphy wrote.
The Times article included a Q&A with Lessig and reporter Nellie Bowles, who was named in the lawsuit along with Ellen J. Pollock, the newspaper’s business editor, and Executive Editor Dean P. Baquet.
Lessig, a campaign finance reform activist, said he was “confident” about his chances against the Times in litigation.
“We certainly think it’s winnable,” he said. “Wouldn’t bring a lawsuit if I didn’t think it was correct and that we should prevail. And indeed, I think we can prevail quite directly. This is not he-said, she-said.”

Asian sandwich shop Fóumami will open a new location in Harvard Square in April following the closing of casual burger eatery Flat Patties last December.
The new Square location is an expansion of the original Fóumami, which opened in 2010 and occupies a space at 225 Franklin Street in Boston’s Financial District. The Square restaurant will have an expanded menu, longer hours, and the addition of draft beer and draft wine, according to Fóumami owner Michael Y. Wang.
Wang, a Harvard Business School alumni, said he had always hoped the restaurant would open a location in the Square.
“Our intention from the beginning was really to expand and I've always wanted to be in Harvard Square, and we're just looking for the right opportunity, and the opportunity came about, so that's why we're going there,” Wang said.
Fóumami sells sandwiches, salads, rice bowls, and noodle bowls. Wang said one of the restaurant’s distinguishing features is the fresh bread they use for the sandwiches.
“What really separates our sandwiches apart is the handmade Chinese bread that we make in the restaurant, which is called Shao Bing,” Wang said. “And that's the platform for all of our sandwiches, so they’re handmade, fresh baked every day.”
The closing of Flat Patties and the opening of Fóumami has been slated for several months. Flat Patties owner Tom J. Brush announced in January 2019 that is was unlikely that the restaurant would survive after its lease ended in 2019. In September, Wang told Eater Boston that Fóumami would occupy the 33 Brattle Street spot in the Square.
Flat Patties is far from the only fast-casual Harvard Square restaurant to shut its doors recently — Qdoba, Chipotle, and Crema Cafe have all closed within the past year and a half.
Brush cited increased rent as one reason for the closure. Asana Partners, the North Carolina-based development company that owns several retail storefronts on Brattle St., owned the restaurant’s retail space.
Denise A. Jillson, president of the Harvard Square Business Association, wrote in an email that she expects Fóumami to serve not just students but also“residents, students, and visitors from around the region and around the globe.”
Wang wrote in an email that he was following in his family’s footsteps by opening a restaurant, as his grandfather founded Asian restaurant chain Chew Young Roo. Wang wrote that the recipes served in store are originally from his family.
“The food we serve at Fóumami are all authentic family recipes that my family have served in various restaurants we’ve operated both in Asia & the U.S. over the generations, and have been passed down to me,” he wrote. “What Fóumami serves is NOT fusion!”
