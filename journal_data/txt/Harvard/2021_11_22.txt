After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a child of Dominican immigrants living in the Bronx, N.Y., it is rare to walk to the supermarket without hearing bachata or merengue playing from a car stereo or neighbors gossiping in Spanish with their distinct Dominican accents. Cambridge, Mass. has offered a stark contrast. At Harvard, I am pleasantly surprised whenever I encounter a fellow Dominican student, as these encounters are few and far between. So, when I came across a new restaurant on the first floor of the Smith Campus Center, a self-proclaimed “Dominican Kitchen” called “Las Palmas,” I was naturally elated. It would serve as a welcomed break from the subtly-spiced Annenberg recipes, and more importantly, a tangible representation of my ethnicity on a campus where I feel increasingly detached from my roots every day. Las Palmas seemed to have the potential to provide at least a semblance of the vibrant Dominican culture that characterizes my hometown.
Las Palmas distributed free empanadas as part of a promotion. While mine lacked the crisp that is essential to a well-cooked empanada, it was decent nevertheless. I was willing to give Las Palmas the benefit of the doubt, that is, until I read the rest of the menu. Its singular entree offering is a Chipotle-style “Build Your Own Bowl,” with white rice or spring mix as a base; chicken, pork, and tofu as protein options, and a variety of “toppings” including cranberries, plantain chips, and shredded carrots. Quite frankly, without the words “Dominican Kitchen” written in bold green letters on their sign, I would not have recognized Las Palmas as a Dominican restaurant even after reading its entire menu. And that is coming from someone who was raised by two Dominican parents in a neighborhood very close to Washington Heights — which houses the largest concentration of Dominicans outside of the DR — and who visits family in the Caribbean peninsula nearly every year.
Lacking sancocho (meat stew), mangú (mashed green plantains) accompanied with eggs, salami, and fried cheese, and white rice with stewed beans and braised chicken — some of the most prominent Dominican dishes — as well as other typical foods such as tostones and yaniqueques, Las Palmas can hardly be described as a “Dominican Kitchen.” Because of the owners’ failure to include these on their menu, I initially assumed that they lacked proximity to Dominican culture. However, co-owner of Las Palmas Seila J. Green implied otherwise, stating that the restaurant’s aim was to help people “know our culture, where we come from, and taste different flavors.”
Green’s presumed familiarity with typical Dominican cuisine invites the question: Why aren’t the dishes that are most commonly featured on the dinner tables of Dominican households included on Las Palmas’s menu? To me, the most obvious explanation is an impulse to cater to the mostly white customers who frequent the Smith Center. Options like coffee with oreo crumble rim, tres leches with nutella, and tropical mango tofu are clear efforts to make menu selections more palatable to those unfamiliar with authentic Dominican food. Green claims that she and her husband are passionate about offering authentic Dominican food, but with a menu that includes only one uniquely Dominican item — morir soñando, which is a drink made with milk and orange juice — this passion seems to be less of a priority and more of an afterthought.
Deciding to open a restaurant marketed as “Dominican” comes with the responsibility of accurately representing our cuisine, particularly considering the crucial role that food plays within Dominican communities. By misrepresenting our food, Las Palmas also misrepresents our culture, traditions, and values, which is particularly problematic at a place like Harvard because it spreads a false image among people who lack the knowledge to recognize its flaws. While I am certainly a proponent of diversifying food options in the Square, they should be adequately advertised, and Las Palmas can only be described as a “Latin Kitchen” at best. The restaurant’s website states that they aim to provide “a taste of the Dominican Republic,” but in my view, Las Palmas only offers visibility of the Dominican Republic — it acknowledges its existence but does not authentically portray its culture.
As a Dominican student at Harvard, I am disappointed that Las Palmas does not seem willing to run the risk of offering authentic food that would perhaps be rejected by many on Harvard’s campus on account of being too foreign, although I am not particularly surprised. While I was thrilled upon encountering Las Palmas for the first time, three weeks later, I still cannot bring myself to spend $10 on a “rice bowl.” Every time I consider ordering from this Smith Center restaurant, I ultimately opt for Annenberg instead. It is almost as though accepting Las Palmas’ claim of authenticity would taint the classic aromas of the true Dominican kitchen in which I have grown up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hear from a lot of people at Harvard that they are profoundly lonely. Which is ironic, in a Greek tragedy, horror movie, “I know this is going to happen but god, I can’t turn away and it makes me want to scream” kind of way. All these lonely people packed together like sardines, in tiny dorms and dining halls and classrooms! Befriend each other! You have demand and supply in spades, so why is the market not working itself out?
Unfortunately, we are not economics’s rational actors. We are bidirectionally afraid. We shy away from putting ourselves out there because being perceived is a whole mortifying ordeal of being known. What if you share the truest core of who you are, and other people don’t like it? Your inner child can’t take the rejection.
At the same time, we skitter off instead of reciprocating when other people allow us a glimpse into them, because what even is the socially optimal move? Do you tell your own story, supply emotional support, or quickly acknowledge the overshare and move on? What if you’re moving too fast? What if they didn’t even mean for you to see that part of them and now it’s just awkward? There’s just so much that can go wrong.
Forming relationships, especially at Harvard, is a repeated dance of give and take. We are balancing on tightropes, beating around bushes, and extending olive branches with shaky hands that we hope others will take. We’d love to grab a meal! We just have to check our jam-packed calendars first so we seem like well-adjusted, busy bee Harvard students, instead of desperately lonely — never mind the fact that the only person we’ve seen in days is the night guard at Lamont.
This precarious relationship between “appearing too eager and scaring people off” and “appearing too apathetic so no one ever tries to approach you” is enshrined in the sky, in Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn are your social planets, but in opposite ways: Jupiter is growth; Saturn limitation. Jupiter is every new experience you have with a new person that teaches you something about yourself. Jupiter shakes hands with strangers and thinks “what an adventure!” Meanwhile, Saturn restricts, inhibits, curls inwards, and hides from the public eye. Saturn watches friend groups chattering away over dinner and mosh pits at parties from a distance, with wary apprehension.
There’s inherent tension here, even before we consider the aspect of opposition. Just as planets in a natal chart can line up right on top of each other in conjunction, they can line up directly across from each other, in opposition. Opposition has the energy of meeting eyes with your archenemy across the room; it’s charged. The two polar opposite signs at the ends of the opposition push and pull at each other, both vying to assert their own perspective. With Jupiter opposite Saturn, the tug-of-war that already exists between these two antithetical methods of socialization becomes even more intense, frustrating, and anxiety-inducing.
Astrologers call opposition a “hard” or “challenging” aspect, and for good reason — it’s hard to deal with! But opposition — both the type inherent to Jupiter and Saturn as contrary social planets, and the type between any two planets with 180 degrees between them — isn’t bad just because it’s hard. So many things at Harvard are hard: comping clubs, taking midterms right after Harvard-Yale, the miles-long trek to the Quad. But we follow through with them regardless, because the end goal, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow — doing cool work in a cool student organization, school spirit and passing grades, beloved friends in the Quad — is well worth it. Likewise, friendships and socialization at Harvard are hard, but you will end up content.
You just have to harmonize your oppositions. By the order of signs, it just so happens that those in opposition always share at least one quality: modality. Both are either cardinal, the enthusiastic initiators of the zodiac; fixed, stable, and resolute signs that you can always lean on; or mutable, free spirits who go with the flow. For every opposition, there is a balancing point on which opposing planets can lean, such that the pendulum of their tossing and turning doesn’t tangle so much. In even the most drastic of opposites, there is commonality.
There’s a center of gravity between the extreme ends of the social interaction spectrum: outgoing, enthusiastic Jupiter, and aloof, skeptical Saturn. It’s different for everyone, but you’ll find it because it all comes from you, written in the stars from your birth. Take it easy. Friendships at Harvard are hard to navigate. But you have the map to the treasure right there, inside of you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Farewell, pixelated faces; hello actual farewells. This spring, Harvard will host an in-person Commencement ceremony for the first time in over two years, bringing back the graduated (and soon graduating) Classes of 2020 and 2021 for the goodbye they never got. The ceremony — a make up for the two glorified slideshows that heralded Covid-era graduations — will take place in Tercentenary Theatre with “as much pomp and circumstance” as usual, according to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s announcement Thursday.
We are giddy at the news. To quote President Bacow, the ceremony signals the end of an “extraordinarily trying time” that put so much togetherness on hold. The students the ceremony will celebrate know this better than anyone. Our peers from the Classes of ’20 and ’21 saw their college careers end on a random Tuesday in March, and were whisked off to the rest of their lives before in-person classes resumed, dining halls reopened, and campus returned to its standard density. The long wait — the months of uncertainty and letdowns regarding when celebrations might be safe again, the protracted period without college parties and faces — only renders the reunion more meaningful. This makeup graduation feels, perhaps prematurely, like a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel.
In that spirit of renewal, we encourage returning students to re-invest in the relationships, conversations, and communities the pandemic stunted, if only for a weekend! The ceremony will be an opportunity to gain closure and to reflect on the academic and personal growth that has no doubt crystalized since their college days. We hope our graduated graduates leave the ceremony feeling that this chapter of their lives finally got the ending it deserved. Hopefully, Commencement can provide closure for those still grieving what the past years could have been.
Last year, we expressed concern that the University’s lofty ambitions of a multi-class graduation would prove to be a hollow promise. We are delighted to have been proven wrong. Not only has the University followed through on its promise to hold a late graduation ceremony, but it has also taken comprehensive steps to ensure it is accessible. Harvard will be withholding registration charges, providing meals and campus housing free of charge, and is even offering financial assistance for transportation to those who need it. Such measures will hopefully increase attendance, minimizing the impact of “post-graduation scatter” which has plagued other after-the-fact graduations and strengthening what already seems like a promising ceremony.
We have only one minor complaint, or rather request, for the ceremony’s organizers. The University has yet to clearly express its guest policy. As of writing, the FAQ page mentions only that graduates will have “a limited number of tickets” to give away to friends and family, without specifying the number of visitors that will be welcomed. Cambridge hotels are notoriously expensive, and fill up months in advance during regular graduation years; three graduations stuffed into one weekend will only compound the nightmare. Given the understandably high anticipation surrounding the twin ceremonies and the logistical reality that travel costs rise and housing options shrink with each day, we urge the University to make said information available as soon as possible.
This fall, after semesters apart and far too many hours spent on Zoom, two Harvard classes will get a chance to tie a bow on their college lives, just like every class before them. Amid the pandemic, a generation of students has endured crushing deferrals of key milestones. But hope springs eternal. Come May, we hope the Classes of 2020 and 2021 will be able to celebrate their accomplishments big and small and bid a proper goodbye to fair Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to expand the Wintersession program and to fund a new program that will allow students to explore local restaurants at a discounted rate during its Sunday meeting.
Through the first legislation, the UC will double funding for its Wintersession program, which aims to financially support students who incur fees associated with career-oriented internships and projects during the period between the fall and spring semesters. The funding will increase from $30,000 to $60,000 to accommodate student demand. The legislation notes that students requested a total of $246,849.35 in grants last year.
The legislation also extended the Wintersession period, which the UC will now consider from the start of Reading Period to the first day of the Spring semester.
The legislation prioritizes first-generation low-income students and students who receive full financial aid from the College. The Finance Committee reviews each application and distributes funds on a case-by-case basis, per the legislation.
Last year, the program came under scrutiny when the UC inadvertently revealed the identities of students who applied for funding in an email addressed to applicants. In addition, students who were granted funding complained about disbursement delays.
The new legislation was sponsored by Quincy House Representative Daniella M. Berrospi ’24.
The second act will appropriate funds for a new initiative called “Crimson Takes Cambridge,” which uses student dining preferences the Communications Committee obtained from an October initiative.
The piece of legislation grants the program, which will begin in early 2022, funds to provide each undergraduate with three coupons that can be used at various local establishments in and near Harvard Square.
“Half of the Harvard undergraduate population have never experienced a pre-COVID Cambridge and have struggled with reconnecting with the greater student community over the course of the pandemic,” the legislation reads.
In the legislation, the UC wrote that the legislation will help local businesses, which have struggled to stay afloat financially due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“Crimson Takes Cambridge will incentivize students to go to the participating restaurants and stores to redeem the coupon and would eventually lead to repeat customers, therefore increasing business for the participating stores,” the act reads.
The bill appropriates $1,500 from the Communications Committee’s funds with $1,350 going toward what the UC must provide for the program, and the remaining $150 being used for the “physical advertisement” of the program.
The act was sponsored by Head of Communications Yousuf A. Bakshi ’23, Crimson Yard Representative Ethan C. Kelly ’25, Elm Yard Representative Jeremy E. Ng ’25, Dunster House Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24, Maple Yard Representative Jada Pierre ’25, and Berrospi.

Medical experts and patients discussed the challenges associated with treating and studying long Covid — the umbrella term for long-lasting symptoms in patients after a Covid-19 infection — in an event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health on Friday afternoon.
The panel, which was moderated by journalist Fiona Lowenstein, featured patient advocates and long Covid sufferers Chimére L. Smith and Hannah E. Davis, along with physicians E. Wesley “Wes” Ely, Gary H. Gibbons, Kavita Patel, and Steven Phillips.
HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams introduced the panel and said the organizers hoped the event would center around patient experiences.
“Our goal for today’s program is not only to better understand this condition but to put patients at the center of this conversation in order to head off the next public health crisis,” Williams said.
The panel included a discussion on mistrust between physicians and patients with long Covid. Smith said patients, herself included, often hesitate to seek medical care for their long Covid symptoms out of fear they will be dismissed.
“I am deathly afraid to go back to a lot of those doctors, because my fear is, still, almost two years later, that I still run into doctors who have no idea what I’m talking about, and they refuse to listen,” Smith said. “All these medical records I have, all of this, all the things I’ve been a part of, and they still don’t listen.”
Ely said ignoring patients with long Covid is “a form of testimonial injustice.”
“They are the experts of their own illness and what they were being told was that they weren’t the experts of their own illness,” Ely said.
The panelists also discussed difficulties in diagnosing long Covid, since it cannot be accurately done with antibody tests.
Patel said she fears inaccuracies of antibody tests may result in the denial of coverage and barriers to comprehensive care for affected patients.
“We’re going to have so many people where that’s all I can do is kind of target symptoms and never actually fully acknowledge that these things are related,” Patel said. “We do a lot of damage by associating one diagnostic criterion so to speak for something that we fully don’t understand.”
There are efforts to improve the clinical response to long Covid including a study funded by Congress to examine causes and risk factors associated with long Covid, according to Gibbons.
Gibbons also said formalizing case definitions and findings from studies about different post-viral diseases can help clinicians move toward a more concrete understanding of long Covid.
“There may be some common themes about some of these responses to these microbial or other injuries that we can all learn from,” Gibbons said. “One of the things we’re trying to do to recover is create those sort of cross disciplinary teams that are not only just inclusive of scientists, but as we’ve tried to indicate, with patients as partners.”
Smith said she along with other patients remain frustrated by the limited involvement of patients in decisions related to long Covid.
“What I like to caution organizations — health organizations and any other organizations who say that they’re patient-centered — is that there needs to be a complete overall overhaul about what that looks like,” Smith said.
“It can be a little frustrating because I feel like I’ve almost been waiting for two years,” she added.

A new political party founded by a pair of Harvard graduates is set to take power in Bulgaria following its victory in the country’s Nov. 14 parliamentary election, in which its leaders ran on an anti-corruption platform that emphasized their Harvard credentials.
Harvard Business School alum Kiril Petkov is in talks to become the country’s next prime minister after We Continue the Change — a party he founded with Assen Vassilev ’00 — finished ahead of the conservative GERB party, which had governed the country for much of the last decade.
We Continue the Change was created ahead of Bulgaria’s third election of 2021, which was held in November after attempts to form a government following the two previous elections failed. Petkov and Vassilev — nicknamed the “two Harvards” — promised to improve relations with the European Union during the campaign.
Petkov and Vassilev met while studying at Harvard Business School, where they received MBAs in 2007 and 2008, respectively. After Bulgaria’s first parliamentary election of 2021 ousted former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, Petkov and Vassilev served together in an interim government, with Petkov as economy minister and Vassilev as finance minister.
According to Bulgaria’s constitution, when a government cannot be formed, the president must appoint ministers for a provisional government. Venelin Ganev, a professor of political science at Miami University, said Petkov and Vassilev were chosen by Bulgarian President Rumen Radev in part because of their Harvard credentials.
“The reason he has chosen Petkov and Vassilev is because they have been to Harvard and therefore possess the expertise, and the knowledge, and global reputation which would enable them to cope with Bulgaria’s problems,” Ganev said.
“The name Harvard stands for the success of young Bulgarians abroad and the ability of Bulgarians to perform well on a world stage,” he added.
Maria Popova, a professor of political science at McGill University, said the Harvard name proved to be “a double-edged sword” for Petkov and Vassilev, as it was used for negative attacks by their opponents during the campaign.
“Some of their opponents are using the Harvard affiliation to signal arrogance and thinking that you can do something big, even though you’re not prepared,” she said.
A lack of understanding about the difference between an MBA and a Harvard College degree led to some drama in the Bulgarian media, according to Popova.
“Journalists who wanted to take him down sent an inquiry to Harvard, and Harvard College said he wasn’t a graduate, and they were like, ‘See, he is faking it,’” Popova said.
Christian H. M. Ketels, a professor at Harvard Business School who said he taught Petkov, said he hopes to see Petkov put his HBS education to practice as prime minister.
“I hope that Kiril can draw a little bit on what he has learned, but also on the experience that he’s gained,” he said.
“It’s great to see that he’s grown as a leader, and charismatic, and being able to mobilize a lot of people,” he added.
Popova, who received her Ph.D. in Government from Harvard, said she taught Vassilev while working as a teaching assistant in an introductory comparative politics course. She said Vassilev was an outstanding student.
“He was indeed one of the best students in that section,” she said. “He wasn’t the kind of person who dominates discussions in sections, but the kind of person who, when he does say something, it’s always really accurate, to the point, insightful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana urged undergraduates in a Friday interview to remain vigilant after a recent spate of local crimes and as many students prepare to travel for Thanksgiving amid the pandemic.
On Nov. 12, a man who appeared to be under the influence drove a truck into Harvard Yard, crashing into the edge of Lamont Library and nearly striking several students. The week before, a male assailant — accompanied by two other male suspects — stabbed a Cambridge resident near Mather House.
Khurana called the incidents “very distressing” and said maintaining the safety of College affiliates is “paramount.”
“We live in a city, and we live on an open campus, and that open campus creates a great deal of energy, but it’s porous,” he said. “It means we have to be very, very mindful of our surroundings.”
Khurana said campus resources including Harvard police, Securitas guards, and residential security protocols are all intended to keep students safe.
As students look ahead to a respite from classes during Thanksgiving break, Khurana acknowledged that many undergraduates will be traveling during the holiday and returning to campus after — a first since the pandemic’s onset — and said the College respects students’ travel plans.
“We always want to respect the choices our students are making and how they want to spend these days,” he said. “We know that there’s large numbers of students who are both on campus and large numbers of students who are traveling.”
During the Friday interview, Khurana added that students should observe current University health guidelines, including restrictions on gathering sizes and an increased Covid-19 testing cadence for on-campus undergraduates after Thanksgiving break. College students living in Harvard’s dorms will be required to submit three tests per week starting Nov. 28, the College announced in an email last week.
“All of us need to be vigilant as we enter this first large travel season while the pandemic continues, but recognizing that we are also in a better place than we were in many areas of our nation, than we were pre-vaccine,” Khurana said.

Classroom to Table, the popular College program that brings faculty and students together to share food and company, is back for the first time since the pandemic’s onset — albeit through a modified format.
The new initiative, called “C2T: Coffee Break,” invites instructors and students to talk over coffee and pastries at Pavement Coffeehouse in the Smith Campus Center for the remainder of the fall semester, the College announced Nov. 11.
The program will permit groups of two to five students to gather with a faculty member. Harvard will give each participant a $10 voucher.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that Harvard launched the new format last week based on participant feedback.
“The coffee break edition of Classroom to Table is a development that students and faculty had been asking about before, namely a more casual option than formal restaurant meals,” she wrote.
Students have less than three weeks to take advantage of the program. Dane wrote that the College rolled out the initiative last week out of caution for the health and safety of affiliates.
“Given the public health situation at the start of the semester and the public health guidance, it did not seem prudent or allowed to be encouraging groups to dine together indoors, hence the delay in starting up this semester,” Dane wrote.
She added that logistical planning and the creation of “an IT support system” also delayed the program’s launch.
Dane did not respond to requests for the budget of the coffee program. In past years, Classroom to Table has run out of funding.
Dane added that traditional sit-down restaurant options may return next semester.
Melody M. Wang ’22, who has used Classroom to Table several times, said she believes the traditional model is more meaningful than the new coffee chat model.
“I personally prefer the more extensive meals just because, one, obviously, you have a lot more time to speak with your professors and friends, and, two, obviously, the food is absolutely delicious,” Wang said. “I would say I think those are a bit more conducive to just having deeper conversations.”
Classroom to Table was founded in 2015 by then-senior Sharon Zhou ’15. Zhou said in an interview that she pitched the program to administrators because of the connections she made with professors across the Computer Science and Classics departments.
“My favorite story from the program is this one friend of mine was from Kansas and took out all the Kansas people at Harvard which I think was two other students and two professors and they just had lunch on Harvard’s dime, and I was like, great,” Zhou said. “It wasn’t subject-related at all — and I love that spirit.”
Reacting to the coffee break edition, Zhou said she believes it will offer “a different vibe,” albeit one that could still help faculty and students connect.
She also said she hopes the College invests further in Classroom to Table.
“I think expansion would be very welcomed by both faculty and students,” Wang said. “It’s great that we’re starting back with coffee and pastries, but for next semester and beyond, I’d love to see it continue growing.”
In any form, Classroom to Table helps make connections more accessible, Zhou said.
“That’s really what we’re really what we’re paying Harvard to do, right?” Zhou said. “We want these close interactions. This is what matters most — this is where you learn and continue learning afterwards.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Harvard seniors were awarded the American Rhodes Scholarship to pursue postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford in fields ranging from mathematical theoretical physics to public policy, the American secretary of the Rhodes Trust announced Saturday.
Harvard students make up four of the cohort of total 32 American Rhodes recipients, which includes 22 women, a record tally in the scholarship’s 119-year history. A total of 379 Harvard students have now been named American Rhodes Scholars since 1902.
The prestigious scholarship pays for recipients to pursue postgraduate studies at Oxford beginning in October 2022.
This year, the College tied with the United States Military Academy for the highest number of American Rhodes Scholar recipients. This cohort is the second class of scholars to be selected following a virtual interview and application process.
Trisha N. Prabhu ’22, who concentrates in Government with a secondary in Economics and hails from Naperville, Ill., said the announcement of winners was held over Zoom.
“I was just sitting there on the Zoom call and trying my best not to feel nervous, but also really enjoying the company of the other 15 folks who it was just really incredible to meet,” she said.
Prabhu, whose parents immigrated from India, said that the “rigorous” application process for the scholarship was “absolutely worthwhile.”
“I don’t think they ever envisioned for me when they first came to the U.S. that this is something that their daughter could accomplish or achieve,” Prabhu said. She plans to pursue Master’s degrees in social science of the internet and public policy while at Oxford.
Samantha “Sam” C. W. O’Sullivan ’22 said she has received an “outpouring of love” since the announcement.
“My family has just kind of showered me with so much love, and all of my friends have been so supportive and excited for me,” O’Sullivan said. “We’ve just been spending a lot of time together celebrating.”
O’Sullivan, a joint concentrator in Physics and African-American Studies who hails from Washington, said she is “really excited” to pursue Master’s degrees in the philosophy of physics and applied linguistics.
“I studied the language Gullah through the African language program, which is spoken in the South Carolina region of the United States, and it's a language my family has spoken dating back generations,” O’Sullivan said. “I’ve become really interested in questions of how other languages talk about the physical universe and concepts like time and space.”
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, a History and Mathematics joint concentrator who is pursuing a concurrent Master’s degree in Computer Science from Harvard, said he “really didn’t expect” to receive the scholarship.
“When I called my parents, they didn’t know what the Rhodes Scholarship is,” said Cheng, who hails from Wynnewood, Penn. and was recently elected Undergraduate Council president. “My parents, when they heard about me getting the Rhodes Scholarship, said ‘good job, but better things will come soon.’”
Elizabeth X. Guo ’22, a Crimson News executive, said she “couldn’t believe it” when she received the news of the scholarship.
“I am very, very grateful for my family and my friends and my professors who have supported me all throughout this journey,” Guo said. “All the finalists were so talented and so impressive, so I feel very fortunate for this opportunity and just really excited to be able to study at Oxford for two years.”
Guo, a Physics concentrator with a secondary in Government from Plano, Texas, plans to study mathematical theoretical physics and social science of the internet while at Oxford.
Cheng, who intends to study technology and energy policy at Oxford, credited the scholarship to a network of professors, coaches, and other mentors.
“It’s really easy to celebrate an individual alone,” Cheng said. “But in a lot of ways, it’s not really my achievement. It’s theirs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The NCAA moved to expand the women’s ice hockey championship from eight to 11 teams earlier this month — a change that followed years of pressure from Harvard coaches, who argued that a playoff expansion would improve gender equity in college hockey.
Harvard coaches Katey Stone and Lee-J Mirasolo have spearheaded the national push to expand the women's championship. More recently, however, the movement, now known as “#CloseTheGap,” has gained significant public traction.
“The role that Lee-J and Coach Stone have played is literally the center of this because, without them, this wouldn't have happened,” junior defender Kyra Willoughby said. “They've been fully leading the charge behind the scenes for a long time and have dedicated so much time to making this happen. And I think we're all really grateful for them and their work — women's hockey is lucky to have them be part of its story.”
According to Stone, the pandemic presented a unique opportunity to allow coaches from all over the country to meet nationally, which proved to be more productive than organizing large conventions. One virtual coaches meeting in April led to the creation of the Women’s Hockey Bracket Expansion Committee, chaired by Stone. The subcommittee then enlisted the help of the law firm Kaplan, Hecker & Fink LLP to investigate the NCAA’s gender inequities — a move spurred by the March Madness social media campaign, which highlighted significant disparities between the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. However, conversations about expanding the women’s hockey championship were tabled in September. The movement gained momentum once again when the law firm released the findings of its external review in October.
“The findings show that women's ice hockey was one of the three top sports that had the most inequities across the board,” Stone said. “Not just with tournaments and championships, but a laundry list of other areas and resources that were far and away behind our male counterpart.”
The external review reveals that the NCAA spends about $4.2 million on the men’s hockey championship and $656,827 on the women’s, with $9,805 spent on each male student-athlete and $3,421 spent on each female student-athlete. Additionally, 26.7 percent of men’s teams can qualify for the NCAA Division I Tournament while only 19.5 percent of women’s teams make the tourney.
With the Nov. 10 vote, the circumstances began to shift when the NCAA expanded the championship from eight to 11 teams.
“I think it’s a huge day for women's hockey. It's progress,” Stone said. “As our sport continues to grow, we hopefully will continue to add more and more teams to our championship. The thing that has happened for so long is our sport grew and nothing happened, so this is a great turning point for us.”
Although the championship expansion is promising for gender equity in college hockey, the ruling falls short of advocates’ request for 12 teams, with the NCAA settling on expanding the championship from eight to 11 teams.
“The reason they only gave us 11 is so that our participation matches the men's participation exactly in their national tournament, which we found frustrating because they have had greater participation this entire time,” Willoughby explained. “So now, when we're trying to ask for 12, which is an easier tournament format, they come back to us and say, ‘Okay, well, we'll give you 11 but just so you can't have more than the men.’”
In a press release announcing the move, the NCAA wrote that the expansion will bring the women’s tournament “in line with” the men’s “in terms of access to the bracket.”
“Currently, 41 schools sponsor national collegiate women's ice hockey,” the press release said. “With 11 teams in the bracket, 27% of the teams will have access to the championship bracket. Division I men's ice hockey is sponsored by 60 schools, with a 16-team field (27%) getting to play for a national championship.”
Another reason to push for an expanded championship outside of gender equity is boosting the stakes within the sport, according to Harvard forward Becca Gilmore. With more slots open in the championship, earning a spot in NCAAs seems more attainable and thus serves as an incentive to players around the country.
On Tuesday, the NCAA will hold another vote to decide whether the championship expansion will occur this season or next season. Although Gilmore, a senior, will not directly benefit from the change if it is made for the 2023 tournament, she views this movement as a long-term investment for the sport of hockey.
“[The vote] was just as much for us as for the people that are coming off and playing in future years, as well as the people that have already played that didn't get a fair opportunity to compete at the highest level in terms of the national championship,” Gilmore said.

Given that dear old John was a pilgrim himself, I think he would want Harvard to give us more than three days to celebrate Thanksgiving (#rollcrim!). With finals looming ahead, you have no idea what to do with this sweet but small amount of time. You ask yourself: what are other students doing? Who’s taking this much needed break as well, a break, and who’s finally catching up on five weeks of unwatched CS50 and Ec10 lectures?
Don’t sweat—that’s what we’re here for. Ignore David Malan, que the Gossip Girl Thanksgiving episode, and get yourself in the spirit by completing our ultimate Harvard Thanksgiving Bingo! Compare results with your friends and when your turn arrives at the dinner table, be thankful you’re not the only one who will have that untouched 10-page Sleep final paper waiting for them when they get back. Good luck and as I’m assuming old timey English settlers used to say: godspeed!

Mostly A’s: Bandwagon Swiftie
You’re a new Taylor fan that got into her music recently. Old fans have some beef with you for not sticking with Tayor through her “Reputation” era, but at least you hopped on the Taylor train eventually and can appreciate good music. Glad this finally happened for you.
Mostly B’s: Fake Fan
You listened to the album to be in the know but don’t actually get what the big deal is. It sounds like every other pop album. You probably didn’t make it all the way through and only really listened to relate to everyone around you.
Mostly C’s: OG Swiftie
You’re an old fan that grew up listening to Taylor. The new album has you in your feels, especially since you’ve been waiting for this album to come out for ages. The perfect fall weekend coinciding with the album dropping was written in the stars and you can’t get enough of your “Red”-era Taylor.
Mostly D’s: Emotionally Invested Swiftie
You listened to the album 10+ times already. “All Too Well” has destroyed you in ways you didn’t know it could. Emotional stability is an unattainable privilege at this point but at least the album is free therapy.
