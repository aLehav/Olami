Mainstream success often brings intense public scrutiny and, with it, a sense of caution. But not even immortalization in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame could stop Green Day from naming their thirteenth studio album, released on Feb. 7, “Father of All Motherf**kers.” The California-based punk rockers’ latest release harnesses the brash flippancy of their early days to bring the new decade an unapologetic dose of ’90s nostalgia.

Despite its musical mixing of the past and present, this album belongs to neither. Green Day has never shied away from pointed invectives against public figures, global affairs, and the deterioration of American society — the band’s 2004 magnum opus “American Idiot” is a prime example — and the trend continues, in all its irreverent glory, on “Father of All Motherf**kers.” But in a distinct change from its earlier work, the band stops short of naming their adversaries, opting instead for generic but instantly recognizable rhymes about a world plagued by “hysteria and paranoia.” Political but never preachy, the album ricochets off 21st century fears with enough classic punk flair to create something truly timeless.

The album’s forceful opener, “Father of All…” kicks with a searing guitar riff. In just four short lines of high-intensity falsetto, the first verse touches on fruitless optimism, climate change, and the band’s frustration with the hypocrisy of the music scene. “Everything else is fake. Frauds I tell ya!!” lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong tweeted about contemporary rock the same day he announced the single. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Armstrong differentiated the righteous anger he expressed so poignantly on “American Idiot” with the sheer disgust evoked by current politics: The latter is “just bloody, and it’s gross.” But he makes clear that the circumstances of his writing have no effect on its merit. “I’ve never been more proud of a single before in my life,” Armstrong said, calling “Father of All…” “the ultimate Green Day song.”

The rest of the album’s tone darts back and forth between outrage and fatalism without ever quite making up its mind. On “Fire, Ready, Aim” and “Oh Yeah,” the drumbeat’s stabilizing foundation barely reins in Armstrong’s fury at America’s glorification of violence and superficiality. Then comes “Junkies on a High,” in which Armstrong sings the praises of drugs and alcohol as an antidote to apocalyptic times, seemingly content to “watch the world burn.” Interestingly, a line in the first verse — “I’ve heard it all before, I smashed my fingers in the door” — closely resembles a passage from Green Day’s 1994 hit “When I Come Around”: “I heard it all before / So don’t knock down my door.” Intentional or not, the subtle self-reference exemplifies the band’s ageless appeal.

Just under half an hour long, Green Day’s shortest album yet leaves little time for introspection, and the onslaught of successive uptempo tracks can be overwhelming. Although the album’s structure is consistent with the band’s vision of the gritty, fast-paced ideal of rock music, the addition of a few more lyrical melodies would help create balance without undermining their artistic vision.

But what better way to showcase the vitality and volatility of life than a good old-fashioned guitar solo? The years have yet to erode Green Day’s gift for pairing memorable lyrics with classic punk rock instrumentation — if anything, the band’s emotionally charged messages have never been more relevant. Although well into middle age, Armstrong and his bandmates, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool, are far from growing old. As they’ve grown from breakout stars to political prophets, the trio continue to adapt their tunes to changing times and ideas. Green Day may be far from green, but their music is as fresh as ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Miss Americana” begins like Taylor Swift’s career: with diaries. Sitting cross legged on a window seat, Swift thumbs through her first journal surrounded by a rainbow of notebooks, their covers dotted with stickers and smudged doodles. This is Swift’s core talent: the ability to channel her innermost feelings, those that would usually be relegated to the pages littered around her, into massive, chart-topping songs. From this simple beginning, director Lana Wilson paints a rich and compelling portrait of the person behind the celebrity. If the viewer watches the film with an open mind, cleared of tabloid headlines and vitriolic tweets, they will leave the theater having seen a side of Swift that few stars of her caliber are willing to share with the world. Or, like the 1,300 audience members who watched its Sundance premiere, they will stand and applaud.
Early on, the film established Swift’s deeply ingrained need to be seen as a “good girl,” to somehow hang on to the approval of, well, everyone. Viewers see a young Swift’s face light up as she unwraps a gift on Christmas morning: her first guitar. Dressed in pink pajamas and buried in a pile of wrapping paper, she gleefully shouts, “I am happy!” Just a few moments later, the camera moves to Swift in another pair of pink pajamas, nervously clutching her cell phone as she hears that her recent album has not received any major Grammy nominations. There is something inspiring yet heartbreaking in her response. “This is fine,” she stutters. “I just need to make a better record.” To Swift, it seems inevitable that people will eventually stop listening.
Like Swift herself, “Miss Americana” leans into vulnerability. Beyond the challenges of “Lover”’s lack of award show recognition, it also documents the fallout of her fall from grace and feud with the Kardashian-Wests. It goes without saying that the moment when Kanye West grabbed the microphone from Swift’s hand at the 2009 Video Music Awards has become a bit of a punchline. But watching 19 year old Swift’s crestfallen reaction is painful. Today she describes the incident as “sort of a catalyst for a lot of psychological paths that I went down… fueled by not feeling like I belonged there. I’m only here because I work hard and I’m nice to people.” Swift’s insecurities also extend to her appearance. At one point in the film she confesses a tendency “to get triggered by something whether it’s a picture of me where I feel like my tummy was too big or like someone said I looked pregnant or something, and will just trigger me to starve a little bit. Just stop eating.” Fans can see that even at the height of her success she, like them, struggles. Even outside of her songs, her vulnerability has a relatable, universal quality that fans can latch on to. One wrote on Twitter, “Can’t stop thinking about how the 1989 Era was such a difficult one for Taylor, both physically and mentally, yet she went out there and performed her heart out and reminded every single one of us every night that we survived a bunch of rainstorms and kept walking.”
A behind-the-scenes look at Swift’s decision to become more vocal about her political beliefs also makes for one of the film’s most powerful elements. In particular, “Miss Americana” highlights the impact of the sexual assault trial in which a radio DJ who groped Swift was fired and then sued her for defamation. Swift’s victory in that lawsuit perhaps contributed to the shaky confidence she displays when attempting to explain to several men from her management team her need to speak out against Marsha Blackburn, a candidate for the Tennessee senate who voted against measures designed to protect women from domestic violence and prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. Near tears as the men try to speak over her, she explains that she regrets not speaking out in 2016 and is determined to “speak now.”
This film is exactly what it should be. To the credit of director Lana Wilson, Swift’s bravery and strength are apparent throughout the film. They are a declaration to the world — if they’re going to judge her, they should get to know her first. Know that there is a person behind the album covers and the Instagram posts. And no amount of money or awards or Instagram followers makes her any less human. “#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty was the number one trend on Twitter worldwide,” Swift explains, matter-of-factly. “Know how many people have to be tweeting that they hate you for that to happen?”
But in the end, as it always seems to be for Swift, the most powerful testament to her work comes from her legions of fans. Swift describes feeling like she has grown up with them. And her fans expressed immediate love for “Miss Americana.” One fan wrote after watching the film, “i love how taylor says she isn’t ready for kids as if she hasn’t been raising me for the last 13 years.” That’s it. For anyone who has wondered what made Swift the global phenomenon she is today, it is this: with a hell of a lot of hard work, grit, and talent, she built fundamental human connections with millions of people around the globe. This unique bond can be seen in some of the earliest clips of concert footage included in the documentary. In one grainy shot, Swift, all platinum curls, with a guitar twice her size slung across her body, pauses to speak directly to the audience. With a thick twang she tells them about her first single, imploring, “There’s this radio station called KZLA. I want each and every one of you to call ‘em up and tell ‘em you want to hear a song called ‘Tim McGraw’ by this girl named Taylor Swift… please.” They listened then. And they never stopped.

“Bright Half Life” is the latest work from Tanya Barfield, an accomplished playwright who boasts a dozen scripts among her accolades. The play — which first opened off-Broadway at the Women’s Project Theatre in 2015 — was brought to Boston by the Actors’ Shakespeare Project (ASP) and ended its run on Feb. 16. “Bright Half Life” catalogues the relationship between two women, Erica (Kelly Chick) and Vicky (Lyndsay Allyn Cox), over the span of their decades-long relationship, starting when they meet at their unspecified desk job and ending in divorce years later. Barfield, however, rejects this linear narrative: The show darts between every moment of their relationship in an associative, non-chronological pattern. Their divorce is not the end of the relationship, it seems, but one point among many, a point in a timeline that includes skydiving, raising twins, two messy proposals, and a third date on a Ferris wheel.
Often, divorce is narravitized as a failure, a project gone awry. “Bright Half Life” contests that depiction. A scene where Erica tells Vicky she wants a divorce repeats over and over again; Vicky shouts repeatedly that this has been half her life, half her life taken from her. But years later, as the pair stands in a hospital elevator, Erica asks her: “Would you do it again?” One unspoken answer is yes. Another is that it doesn’t matter. The relationship is repeated in a sequence of moments regardless. It is performed again and again, as in a series of memories. All the good moments exist next to the bad — a fight shifts into a proposal, a kiss shifts into a fight. The title offers a clearer answer to Erica’s question: Even if the relationship was half her life, the life has not been lost, but remains bright.
The show’s skillful depiction of a long-term, interracial lesbian relationship is worth noting. Barfield — an African-American gay woman herself — neither tokenizes the characters nor skips over their identities. Sexuality remains a question throughout, from Vicky’s strained relationship with her “not progressive” parents to a fight over Erica’s blazer, which Vicky describes as “soft butch, androgynous, something.” Issues of race are treated with equal thought. In one scene, Vicky grows frustrated with Erica’s inability to understand her experience as a black woman, explaining, “I just don’t want to have to educate you on your whiteness.” Erica contests that she’s oppressed too, by virtue of her sexuality. Vicky reminds her that it is not the same: “I am black first. I can’t not be black.” It is clear that the production does not use sexuality or race for show, but rather as an authentic, ingrained part of the character’s lives. Diversity isn’t just performed: A majority of the cast and crew consist of women and non-binary people, and a number of them identify their queerness in their program bios.
Cox and Chick excel at embodying intense emotion. Cox’s displays of anger and desperation are palpable and transform the stage, while Chick’s depictions of grief and uncertainty shine. At times, however, the chemistry between the two feels stilted. The show struggled to move between the time periods, sometimes resulting in awkward transitions. The nature of the production presents its own unique challenges. Even for skilled actors, it is challenging to carry a two-person performance. The lack of props also appeared difficult in certain scenes, making otherwise well-done scenes feel amateur.
The show’s lighting and sound design matched the mood well when used, though they were disappointingly sparse. Sound designer Elizabeth Cahill, who previously worked on ASP’s “Macbeth“ last year, proved as skillful with this contemporary script as she had with Shakespeare. The pre-show music, 4 Non-Blonde’s iconic “What’s Up?” followed by Tina Turner’s “Simply the Best,” was a highlight. The set is simple yet elegant: It’s mostly bare, with the exception of a series of over 30 lamps stacked floor to ceiling against one wall. The lamps pulse slowly throughout the show, luminosity flowing across the display. The play is set in the round, giving it an intimate feel.
Barfield’s prose is skillful. The third to last scene, which finds Erica attempting to articulate her love to Vicky in a grief-stricken first proposal, is a beautifully written passage and a stunning articulation of what it means to care for another person. Additionally, the pair’s interpersonal problems are unique and well-developed, requiring a thoughtfulness that is both rare and compelling. Nonetheless, the narrative movement felt shapeless at times. The fragmented style of the script doesn’t preclude the possibility of a clear narrative build, which only seemed to emerge in the play’s final few scenes.
While imperfect, “Bright Half Life” remains an impressive project, one whose caliber of prose and developed conceptual work set it apart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The atmosphere was electric last Wednesday as medical students across the nation celebrated the news that the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1 will be evaluated as pass/fail, potentially as early as January 2022 — I was one of them.
Colloquially known as “Step 1,” the eight-hour, up to 280-question exam tests basic science fundamentals, like biochemistry and genetics, and is typically taken after the second year of medical school. Since its inception in 1992, the test has become ubiquitously recognized as an essential factor that determines a medical student’s future as a physician. Though the test was not originally designed for residency selection purposes, the test is weighted heavily by many residency programs.
The exponential weight placed on the results of this marginally clinically relevant standardized exam has contributed to the toxic, hypercompetitive environment that must be eliminated in medical education. Therefore, I was elated to see the National Board of Medical Examiners will do away with its three-digit scoring system and implement pass-fail evaluation instead. However, while this switch may lead to positive gains in the health and wellness of medical students, there is still additional work to be done in order to ensure these changes lead to true improvements of our broken system.
Firstly, Step 1 is just one of three required USMLE licensure exams. As the policy currently stands, Step 2 (CK) and Step 3 will continue to be evaluated with a three-digit numerical score. While most residency programs don’t require students to sit for Step 2 prior to residency applications, this could change with the new policy. Residency directors could require Step 2 be completed before the application period and then emphasize Step 2 scores more heavily during the application process. Test material companies, which have built a lucrative business for themselves, could then react by creating more over-priced Step 2 prep supplies promising “high yield” material and higher scores. While the latter seems inevitable, I am comforted by the fact Step 2 is a more clinically relevant exam than Step 1, making it a better proxy for clinical acumen.
I am overjoyed we are doing away with the flawed scoring system, but I do worry about the unintended consequences this will have for students at lesser-known medical schools. Every year the U.S. News and World Report ranks the top medical schools in the country. And though there has been criticism about the validity of these lists, they still, unfortunately, hold value in how we perceive medical institutions. Therefore, many students at so-called “low-tier” medical schools and osteopathic medicine programs have used the USMLE exam to make themselves more competitive for residency programs. A pass/fail system inherently privileges students like me at subjectively higher-ranked medical programs. I worry about the effect this system will have on future students’ decisions over where to attend medical school. Will they incur crippling amounts of debt just to attend higher-ranked programs?
Finally and most importantly, changing Step 1 to pass/fail will not address the racial and systemic inequities entrenched in the residency application process. As medical schools across the country have implemented their own pass/fail curricula, Step 1 was the last major objective metric residency programs could use to evaluate candidates. With this gone, more emphasis will be placed on research experience, publication, and subjective evaluations, which are often a reflection of a student’s access to mentors, funds, and opportunities, which tend to be limited for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. To make matters worse, studies have shown that students of color tend to receive lower scores on subjective evaluations during their clinical years. If a student’s chances of getting into their dream residency program hinge on the opinion of racially biased preceptors, what does that mean for the future of medicine?
These are the tough questions we will have to find the answers to as we respond to this change and ponder how to restructure medical education to best fit our society’s needs. While there will be many challenges ahead, I see this change as an opportunity for medical programs and residency directors across the country to redefine what makes a “good” doctor in the twenty-first century. For far too long standardized exams have been the crux of this evaluation. Now is the time for students, educators, and leaders to rise to the occasion and advocate for a selection process that values inclusion, humanity, and community. In lieu of Step 1 scores, residency applicants could be evaluated based on their community involvement, leadership, and more humanistic attributes. Students could dedicate more time in medical school to learning relevant clinical medicine and pursuing meaningful extracurricular activities that will enhance their skills as a physician.
These changes will not come overnight, and it will take time and advocacy to make them happen. However, I am inspired by the student leaders and advocates that have preceded me in making what seemed impossible, possible. Great work has been done; change has been made; now it’s up to us to keep pushing the envelope.

In one sense, the latest feud between two Harvard Law School professors is just more of the same: a Twitter war of no particular distinction. But in another sense, it seems to be a reminder that behind the all-too-high-and-mighty walls of the ivory tower we are by no means safe from an insidious form of contemporary political swordplay.
Since Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz announced his decision to join President Donald Trump’s defense team for the 2020 United States Senate impeachment trial, Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 has engaged Dershowitz in a public, turned personal war of verbiage over the merits of Dershowitz’s arguments against impeaching Trump.
While a lifelong Democrat, Dershowitz became one of Trump’s most vocal intellectual defenders, arguing that the charges brought by the U.S. House of Representatives against Trump on the grounds of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress were not impeachable.  Part of this defense included providing speaking on the Senate floor against impeachment. On the other hand, Tribe has argued that Dershowitz reduced a legitimate constitutional proceeding to a matter of semantics, in addition to claiming that Derschwitz had become “a bit of a publicity hog and a celebrity seeking fellow.” Dershowitz has fired back with equally fiery language, calling Tribe “a zealot and a partisan” and alleging that he has attempted to silence him.
This debacle takes place at a time when students at the Law School are questioning the roles and responsibilities of lawyers in our society. Last month, dozens of Law School students protested a recruiting event held by corporate law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which has represented the oil and gas company ExxonMobil in ongoing climate change litigation. And, one year ago, Law Professor and former Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s divisive defense of  Harvey Weinstein similarly drew protest and divided campus opinion.
As such, the disagreement between Dershowitz and Tribe must be viewed as but one of many arguments in the broader discourse of what good legal defense looks like, taking place on our campus and across the U.S.
Dershowitz absolutely has the right to defend President Trump, both as a private citizen and trial lawyer. Over his high-profile criminal law career, Dershowitz has defended Wikileaks, Mike Tyson, O.J. Simpson, and Claus von Bülow, among others. Moreover, where we notably argued last year that Sullivan’s obligations to the students of Winthrop House provided a conflict of professional interests in his representation of Weinstein, Dershowitz — as far as we can tell — lacks any such competing obligations.
A functioning legal system should guarantee everyone equal protection under the law. Central to that principle is that every defendant, from the most underprivileged to the most controversial or unpopular, is entitled to legal representation. As heinous as some of the crimes the accused he defended were charged with, we believe it has been within his rights and the dignity of his profession to do so.
That said, we recognize that professors and more generally members of the Harvard community will disagree on matters of contemporary politics and legal matters. We encourage this disagreement of opinion, including on the topic of impeachment, believing that disagreement can engender critical and mutually beneficial discourse.
Still, we wish this discourse remained firmly centered on the ideas at stake and did not devolve into ad hominem attacks. Dershowitz has invited Tribe to take their squabble off Twitter and instead hold an “academic” debate about the matter. Such a debate, if opened up for the public to hear, could provide fodder for robust discourse among legal scholars, students, and the general public about one of the most important constitutional and political matters of our generation. In doing so, Dershowitz and Tribe would have the chance to demonstrate what healthy academic disagreement looks like. As it stands, however, their juvenile jabs and attempts at character assassination only perpetuate the clickbaity fueding that now mires the national public sphere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While we celebrated the New Year a month ago, large swaths of Australia were on fire. This, just like superstorms and melting glaciers, is caused by climate change. The environment as we know it is falling apart, and it’s our fault.
A large part of the strain we’re placing on the earth comes down to the food we eat. When I was younger, I spent a lot of time in New York’s Hudson Valley, which is filled with organic farms. This was the vision of agriculture that I was fed: small family farms, rolling green pastures, happy cows. Unfortunately, for the most part, that image isn’t real.
The food system is an industrial behemoth; pigs and cows, for example, are mostly raised in giant contained animal feeding operations, not in grassy fields. The scale of this industry has consequences; it’s been estimated that 14.5 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions come from raising livestock alone. Given this, it’s easy to think that opting out of livestock is the best way to save the planet. Eating ethically, however, requires more thought than you might initially think.
I became a vegan because of climate change; one of the easiest ways to reduce my carbon footprint, I figured, was to change what I ate. Technically, you don’t have to be a vegan to eat sustainably. If you would like to do so, plenty of scientific organizations and national governments have issued guidelines for the amounts and varieties of dairy and meat acceptable to eat on a daily basis. Personally, as a college student, veganism was just easier.
However, veganism is not without its own moral quandaries. A few weeks ago, a video of migrant workers harvesting radishes made the rounds on Twitter, captioned, “heres your reminder that going vegan isn’t cruelty free.” It’s estimated that there are between 1.5 and two million farmworkers in the United States; up to 70 percent of them may be undocumented. Because of their immigration status, these workers are subject to physical, sexual, and economic exploitation; they work in conditions arguably nearing slavery.
Recently, a friend pointedly commented — as I was eating a quinoa salad — that the American demand for quinoa is hurting the communities where the plant is harvested. He was right; quinoa lovers have contributed to a sharp price increase in Peru and Bolivia, keeping it out of reach for the people who once considered it a staple and inadvertently forcing them to eat much less nutritious food instead. The increase in demand for quinoa and other vegan staples also has environmental costs; growing enough to meet demand has caused farmers to resort to unsustainable practices, destroying the local environment.
The list goes on and on; avocados, bananas, tofu, and almonds, among others, are associated with environmental damage and human exploitation. If I were to ignore these things, I would be missing the point of my dietary choices. Mitigating climate change is important to me because of its human impact. Veganism is not the point; limiting suffering is.
Still, given the system we live in, I’m not sure that we can eat a truly ethical diet. This is not a cop-out; it’s actually a profound source of guilt. Around a year ago, before I went vegan, I was asked to help kill a lamb for a barbecue. This was at a small, ostensibly sustainable farm. Part of the reason I agreed was that I believe, in general, a closer connection to the things we eat leads to less of an environmental impact.
But, it is not possible to do this in industrial American society (unless, I guess, you’re Mark Zuckerburg). My mother’s parents actually did live that way — they grew up on small farms in the American south where they harvested or killed virtually all the produce and livestock they ate. Today, that land, if it is being used for farming at all, is probably owned by agricultural giants.
So, it might be impossible in our society to get our food in a way that is truly moral. However, it strikes me that perhaps being perfect is not the point. This is not to accept what is blatantly unjust; it’s simply an admission that, as individual consumers, we are limited in the choices we have over what we consume. This doesn’t mean that we have no power at all — we can demand better treatment of farmworkers and support farmers who treat the earth and their workers well.
I became a vegan because I thought it would be the best way to eat more ethically; it turns out that our food choices are much more complicated. Still, I think the struggle is worth it. Given the choice between doing nothing and doing something, no matter how small, I will always choose the latter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and workers from across Boston gathered at Harvard Business School to protest Indian Consul General Sandeep Chakravorty’s speech at the Harvard India Conference on Sunday.
Chakravorty, an appointed representative of the Indian government, was caught on video in November telling a group of Kashmiri Hindus that the Indian government should model its occupation of Kashmir after Israel’s presence in Palestine.
“If the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it,” Chakravorty said in the video.
According to official government demographic records, Kashmir’s population is over 97 percent Muslim. On August 5, 2019, the Indian government annexed the Kashmiri lands. Kashmir has been in a state of civil lockdown for months as the Indian government pursues the detention of thousands of Kashmiris alongside other “public safety” measures.
Kashmir’s occupation follows in the wake of the Indian government’s passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and creation of the National Register of Citizens — legislation that targets Indian immigrants and Muslims seeking asylum and could potentially disenfranchise thousands of Indian Muslims, according to critics.
After learning of Chakravorty’s invitation to speak at the HIC, Arshad Iqbal — the lead volunteer of the Massachusetts chapter of the global Kashmiri advocacy group Stand With Kashmir — said he emailed the deans of HBS and the Harvard Kennedy School on Feb. 12. Both schools sponsored the conference.
Upon receiving responses citing “free speech” as a reason for Chakravorty’s invitation, the activists turned to public protest.
“They responded with free speech arguments,” Nissar said. “We asked them to disinvite the speaker, and they seemed to dodge that. That’s where it ended, so we took this route of free expression to bring it into public notice, what this person said. It reeks like there’s an intention of cultural suicide.”
Nissar added that many of the protesters felt “deeply hurt” by Chakravorty’s comments.
“We are not people who go on protests routinely. We are working people and students at various universities around,” Nissar said. “The reason we’ve turned up here today in sizable numbers is that his comments have hurt us deeply. Kashmiri culture has its own history, its own ethos. And he says it’s nothing but Indian culture. It’s like he’s erasing us all.”
Harvard spokespersons for HBS Dean Nitin Nohria and HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.
Alongside MIT Students Against War, Boston University Students for Justice in Palestine, and Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, Iqbal Nassar and Harvard Law School students organized a 90-minute protest on the Business School campus where Chakravorty would be speaking.
An hour in, 40 protesters — a mix of Boston anti-war activists, students across Boston, and ethnic and native Kashmiri working class Bostonians — gathered outside Spangler Hall. They shared Kashmiri tea and held signs reading “Kashmir wants Freedom,” while chanting, “No hate speech, hate speech is not free speech!” and “From Kashmir to Palestine, occupation is a crime!”
During the protest, one conference attendee yelled “Stop Islamic atrocity!”, to which the protesters responded by yelling “Shame!”
The Indian government did not respond to a request for comment on the protest Monday.
Throughout the protest, speakers from each of the organizing groups took turns giving speeches.
Zarka Shabir — a Harvard Law School student, protest organizer, and Kashmiri native — reflected on her family in Kashmir during her speech to the protesters.
“It’s been six months since I left home and I haven’t seen a single image of my parents. I speak to them once a week and worry about my family’s safety all the time. We live in constant fear,” Shabir said. “I am a member of this school, I do have a right to be protected by its boundaries. I do not feel represented by this event today.”
Other speeches focused on what protesters termed Harvard’s role in “legitimizing” officials like Chakravorty by giving them a platform.
“Free speech, as far as the U.S. government is concerned, is about protecting citizens from the government. It’s not about giving men like Chakravorty a platform at an institution of higher learning, it’s not about legitimizing them,” Boston anti-war activist Ryan V. Costello said.
As the protest concluded around 1:30 p.m., HLS student and protest organizer Shaiba Rather ’17 called on the students who invited Chakravorty to think critically about their impact on the wider community.
“Indian students who are paying great sums of money to come to Harvard and come to these conferences, interrogate what you hear. Interrogate what kind of country is being built,” Rather said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council unanimously approved legislation expanding the reach and power of the body’s caucus system, which aims to strengthen the UC’s connections with affinity groups on campus.
Previously, caucuses were limited to Council members and could endorse — but not propose — legislation. The newly passed legislation opens caucus membership to all Harvard undergraduates. Caucuses can now propose legislation regarding event publicity or UC issue statements as well.
UC president James A. Mathew ’21 and vice president Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 campaigned for UC leadership in part on expanding the caucus system to more of the student body.
The UC has so far established Black, Latinx, Asian-American, and First-Generation Low-Income Caucuses.
Dudley Community representative Katherine E. Wang ’20, a former Crimson design editor, said the legislation would increase the power of the Council’s caucuses.
“We really want to give caucuses the ability to actually do stuff,” she said.
At Sunday’s meeting, the UC also voted to allocate $300 to a “Meet the First-Generation Low-Income Caucus Event,” a week after it voted to fund a similar event devoted to the Black Caucus.
The Council also voted to help fund Datamatch, a free matchmaking service run by Harvard students. The nearly $3,200 allocation from its discretionary “Burst Fund” continues the Council’s long-standing support for Datamatch.
Kirkland House representative Carter H. Nakamoto ’21 voted against the legislation, arguing that Datamatch could find other sponsors and that other organizations need the UC’s money more urgently.
Nakamoto also criticized what he called Datamatch’s lack of inclusivity. In Jan. 2018, after facing criticism from UC members, the Datamatch team announced they would add a non-binary gender option to the survey.
“I would posit that the way that Datamatch handles issues around non-traditional gender identities is suboptimal and that this is effectively subsidizing these suboptimal recognition of non-binary gender identities,” Nakamoto said.
Adams House representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22 said she personally enjoyed her experiences using Datamatch and called it “a great way to meet people.”
“Datamatch is something so exciting that happens every year for Harvard College students,” Jordan said. “I think one of the responsibilities of the Harvard Undergraduate Council is to provide funds that help to bring the campus closer together.”
The UC also unanimously voted to publicize an Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response healing group using a Council mailing list. Representatives debated the merits of publicizing a university initiative through UC channels.
Jordan described the OSAPR healing group as “essential,” but raised questions about whether publicizing it would set a precedent.
“I just want to make sure that when we send out emails, it’s with intention,” Jordan said. “I would love to show, maybe through the wording of the email, to convey how much we care about it to put our name behind it — not saying that we are the ones who are starting this, but we support it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students sent a letter to HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf earlier this month advocating for better climate change education and programming.
HKS student body president Charlene A. Wang sent the letter, which aims to “strengthen HKS’ focus on the politics and policy of climate change” via three goals: strengthening faculty and teaching around the topic, improving academic structures, and creating a center for climate research.
“As educators of current and future leaders, HKS has a unique opportunity to shift the narrative on climate change—transforming it from an ideological issue to one that delivers jobs, prosperity, health, and opportunities,” the letter reads. “Averting climate collapse comes down to whether we can muster the political will to compel government action. Of all institutions at Harvard, the Kennedy School is best suited for this charge.”
HKS student Camila E. Thorndike, a Bacon Environmental Fellow at the school, said the school lacks “meaningful” climate education.
“We believe that the School of Government is the natural home to lead on educating future public policy makers, expert analysts, even corporate leaders on climate solutions,” Thorndike said. “In our discussions with the administration, there’s a disappointing kind of outsourcing of that responsibility to centers like the the Harvard University Center of the Environment, which may exist but is largely invisible to HKS students.”
On Feb. 14, six days after Wang sent the original proposal, Elmendorf responded to Wang’s message to confirm he had received the proposal and was in the process of developing a “constructive response.”
“Your group raises a large number of issues that cut across different aspects of the School’s work, and developing a constructive response will take me and my colleagues some time,” Elmendorf wrote in an email. “We’ve begun that process, and I think we can have a more useful meeting with you all if we wait until we’ve made some progress on our end.”
Two days after Wang sent the message to the dean, Elmendorf sent an email titled, “Addressing Climate Change in the Kennedy’s School’s Operations” that touched on several climate initiatives the school has launched in recent years.
The letter highlighted the ways HKS has taken steps to reduce its carbon footprint, such as by installing solar panels on some of its buildings, reducing food and plastic waste, and encouraging alternatives to air travel for its faculty and staff.
Elmendorf also wrote about ongoing climate research and fellows at the school, noting that the school was working on an improved method for disseminating that information.
“Our research, teaching, and engagement related to climate change range from climate change agreements to energy markets, science policy, geopolitics and security, human rights and ethics, and more,” he wrote.
“We are currently developing a way to better share information on this work, and we will let you know when it is available,” he added.
Elmendorf ended the letter by writing that he was “heartened” by the school’s focus on climate issues, but was “well aware” there was more work to be done.
Raven Graf, a student at HKS and a member of Harvard’s Climate Leaders Program, said the school’s responsibility to respond to climate change should be an operational and academic goal.
“The core of this comes down to we’re facing down a global crisis that threatens the health, safety, and survival for hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people, and politics and policy is a fundamental barrier to global action and building that political will,” they said. “As a policy school, HKS has an obligation to step up in that context.”
“A really important part of that is we need climate change integrated into the core curriculum,” they added. “Anyone holding a degree from the Harvard Kennedy School needs to understand how their work impacts and will be applied to the context of the evolving climate crisis to be effective in their world and their future work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the eighth consecutive year, Harvard’s financial contribution to the City of Boston fell short of the amount city officials requested as part of a program in which nonprofits voluntarily give funds to the city instead of paying taxes.
The city instituted the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program — which applies to “educational, medical, and cultural” institutions owning property valued at more than $15 million — to alleviate Bostonians’ tax loads. In the program, Boston officials request that nonprofit institutions whose land is tax-exempt voluntarily pay the dollar equivalent of 25 percent of their assessed property value, according to the city’s website.
Harvard contributed $10.1 million to Boston in 2019, approximately 79 percent of the nearly $12.8 million requested by the city. This amount includes the University’s $6.3 million “community benefits” credit.
Program participants can contribute 50 percent of their payments as community benefits. Universities themselves define what constitutes a “community benefit” under the program; the benefits Harvard listed in a 2019 report included partnering with public schools and maintaining its Arnold Arboretum.
Harvard-affiliated hospitals enrolled in the program each paid at least 90 percent of the requested amounts, a better rate than many participating institutions — around half of which gave 50 percent or less than the amount the city asked them to contribute, according to a city report.
PILOT Action Group organizer Enid Eckstein said in an interview that the program is essential to the city because the high number of nonprofit institutions operating in Boston means much of its land, which would otherwise be taxable, is tax-exempt.
“Over 70 percent of Boston’s budget comes from real estate tax. We don’t have any tax,” Eckstein said. “We have limitations on what we can tax on and not tax.”
Eckstein added that she feels the PILOT system is flawed in assessing nonprofit contributions.
“We believe that the property that these institutions currently hold needs to be reassessed at 2020 rates. These institutions were assessed and valued in 2010, which I recall was at the bottom of the recession,” Eckstein said.
Boston City Council President Kim M. Janey said in an interview that she is forming a committee to review PILOT and consider potential improvements.
“We’re leaving millions of dollars on the table that could be invested in our schools and housing and our roads,” Janey said. “But we also need for Harvard and others to do their fair share and contribute their full amount in terms of the PILOT.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that “Harvard has a long history of being a collaborative and reliable partner to its host communities.”
“As a nonprofit, the University engages with the City of Boston in a variety of important ways, including by paying municipal taxes on the University’s non-exempt property, participating in the City’s voluntary PILOT program and delivering hundreds of community programs in Allston-Brighton and throughout Greater Boston,” O’Rourke wrote.
Correction: February 20, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Enid Eckstein is a PILOT coordinator. In fact, she is the PILOT Action Group organizer.

The City of Cambridge reduced its trash by 30 percent — or 7.2 pounds per week per household — from 2008 to 2019, according to a statement released by the Department of Public Works Friday.
In 2009, the city set a goal to reduce trash by 30 percent by the end of 2020 and 80 percent by 2050, compared to 2008 rates. On Friday, Cambridge officials announced the city achieved its trash reduction goal a year early.
In the statement, Cambridge Public Works Commissioner Owen O’Riordan praised the city’s efforts.
“By adding new programs that encourage diverting items from the waste stream and enhancing our existing recycling programs, we’ve been able to achieve this ambitious goal ahead of schedule,” O’Riordan said.
According to the statement, Cambridge households on average produced 15.6 pounds of garbage per week in 2019, compared to 22.8 pounds per week in 2008. The decrease marks a 32 percent reduction.
The statement said the city was able to reach its goal by improving curbside recycling programs and encouraging residents to adopt reduce and reuse practices.
Cambridge’s curbside compost program played a particularly important role in trash reduction, according to the DPW statement.
The program allows more than 32,000 households in Cambridge to dispose of food scraps, napkins, and paper towels in curbside carts that are collected by the DPW. The department then brings the carts to a facility in Charlestown, a neighborhood in Boston, where compostable solids are made into fertilizer.
In its statement, the DPW credited this program with reducing trash by seven percent, lowering net greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting the cost of disposal.
Cambridge’s curbside compost program is part of the city’s zero waste master plan, an initiative aimed at helping the city reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions.
Under the plan, the city also encourages residents to utilize its recycling center and curbside mattress recycling program.
O’Riordan thanked residents for their dedication to trash reduction, with the goal of achieving 80 percent trash reduction by 2050.
“I want to thank Cambridge residents and our Recycling Advisory Committee for their hard work in helping the city reduce the amount of trash we send to the landfill,” O’Riordan said. “It may take an extra minute or two to separate your items, but it’s worth the extra effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Georgetown University’s administration pledged on Feb. 6 to divest from the fossil fuel industry, legal and environmental experts say the decision provides little insight into the decision-making of Harvard’s top administrators as they maintain their stance against divestment.
Columbia Law School Professor Michael B. Gerrard said he is unsure whether or not Georgetown’s efforts will have an impact on Harvard’s divestment movement.
“I think the Georgetown divestment made a wave,” Gerrard said. “Does it amount to a tide? I’m not sure.”
Georgetown announced its decision to divest both public securities and private investments from the fossil fuel industry in a press release earlier this month.
“The Board of Directors has directed the University to implement a policy to continue to seek investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency and related areas that promote a transition to a more sustainable world; to cease new investments in fossil fuel companies; and to divest from fossil fuel investments over the next decade—including divestment from public securities within five years and private investments within ten years,” the press release reads.
No Ivy League university has elected to divest from the fossil fuel industry. Still, Gerrard said he believes that, if one of the eight schools were to divest, others would do the same.
“If one does, it makes it easier for others to follow suit,” Gerrard said.
Georgetown Climate Center executive director Victoria A. Arroyo said she believes universities will have to shift investments away from the fossil fuel industry, but was uncertain how it would specifically play out at Harvard.
“What’s happening at Harvard is just a question of how they make this shift and when,” Arroyo said.
Doug Koplow, who runs the environmentalist organization Earth Track, also said divesting Harvard’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry would take an uncertain amount of time and that implementation details are important.
“I think moving a big ship does take a while,” he said. “It is always important to pay attention to the series of steps that are being planned.”
Experts said Georgetown’s move raised broader questions about how and why universities decide to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
In response to Georgetown’s pledge, University of Virginia School of Law Professor Cale Jaffe said an institution’s economic interests are often pitted against environmental concerns in debates over divestment. Such contrasts, however, are a false dichotomy, according to Jaffe.
“We’re used to seeing the economy pitted against the environment, as if we have to choose one or the other,” Jaffe said. “What the Georgetown statement seems to support is the emerging conventional wisdom that, no, in fact, the best choice from an environmental standpoint will also be the best long-term choice from an economic standpoint.”
Georgetown President John J. DeGioia wrote in a Feb. 6 announcement that Pope Francis’s 2015 missive on the environment would “inform” and “strengthen” the school’s attempts to mitigate climate change. Georgetown University is affiliated with the Jesuit religious order of the Roman Catholic Church.
“Our pursuit of building a more sustainable future is guided by our identity as a Catholic and Jesuit institution, and through the inspiration of Pope Francis, who has articulated an ambitious vision for all of us in his 2015 encyclical,” DeGioia wrote. “His words inform and strengthen our commitment to the environment, and to one another, ensuring that as we move forward, we do so in a spirit of mutual respect and collaboration.”
Divestment has become hot-button issue on Harvard’s campus. Over the past year, ramped-up student activism organized by campus group Divest Harvard prompted the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Medical School faculty to vote in favor of divestment.
Divest Harvard has put forward Earth Day 2020 — April 22 — as a deadline for the University to divest from fossil fuels.
Georgetown’s decision to divest comes four months after the University of California system announced it would divest its $13.4 billion endowment and $70 billion pension fund from fossil fuels.
UC Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher and the UC Board of Regents’ Investments Committee Chairman Richard Sherman wrote in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times in late September that the university system planned to divest from fossil fuels not only to combat climate change, but also because of the industry’s perceived risk.
“We believe hanging on to fossil fuel assets is a financial risk,” the op-ed reads. “That’s why we will have made our $13.4-billion endowment ‘fossil free’ as of the end of this month, and why our $70-billion pension will soon be that way as well.”
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to earlier statements made by University President Lawrence S. Bacow regarding divestment.
Bacow said in a December interview that he agreed with activists about the necessity of climate action, but disagreed that fossil fuel divestment was the most effective method to effect change.
“I share their belief that action is required,” Bacow said. “We just happen to have an honest difference of opinion over what the appropriate action is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly two years since his appointment, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has sought to engage with students, alumni, and political leaders in his extensive international and national travels.
Bacow has not shied away from discussing national issues such as immigration and the role of higher education in the world during his trips, as well as student protests surrounding divestment activism and the development of an ethnic studies department at the school.
In late January, Bacow traveled to the United Kingdom to deliver Emmanuel College’s annual Gomes Lecture at the University of Cambridge. During his speech, Bacow discussed immigration and its impact on higher education. He noted that John Harvard — a colonial minister from the United Kingdom and namesake of the university — immigrated to the United States.
“What was once a strong commitment to academic exchange is being eroded by a visa and immigration process that often treats international students and international scholars with scrutiny and suspicion, if not outright disdain and distrust,” Bacow said. “As a result of the disruptions and delays, talented women and men from around the world are reconsidering their decisions to join our college and university communities.”
Bacow added that he believes national immigration policies can “undercut” the strength of academic institutions.
“Now, let me be clear, national security is a legitimate concern, but I believe we must be wary of policy that undercuts the strength of the very institutions that make coming to the United States worthwhile,” he said.
In July, Bacow penned a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo and then-acting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan to share “deep concern” over immigration policies under President Donald Trump’s administration.
Bacow made headlines following his first foreign trip as Harvard’s president to China and Japan last March. He met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and delivered a speech at the country’s elite Peking University as part of his high-profile visit to the country.
The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Bacow said Harvard will continue promoting exchanges and cooperation with Chinese educational and scientific research institutions during his meeting with the President. The agency also reported that Bacow said he came as a representative of U.S. universities to promote educational exchanges with China.
Former University President Drew G. Faust also met with Xi on a 2015 visit to Tsinghua University.
In recent years, China has faced criticism that the Uighurs, a Muslim minority group living in Western China, experience detention and surveillance at the hands of the Chinese government — allegations the country denies. Bacow’s speech at Peking University made veiled reference to these issues.
“It is no wonder, then, that transformational thought and action often take root on university campuses,” he said. “They are places where individuals are encouraged both to listen and to speak, where the value of an idea is discussed and debated — not suppressed or silenced.”
To conclude his speech, Bacow read from Uighur poet Abdurehim Ötkür, calling him “one of China’s great modern poets.”
Bacow has also reconnected with alumni during foreign visits. During his trip to Asia, he participated in events with local Harvard alumni clubs in Hong Kong and Japan. Last November, he also met with alumni on a trip to the inaugural International Leadership Workshop held by the Harvard Alumni Association in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
Throughout his travels, Bacow also made references to protests in Cambridge — including calls for the divestment of Harvard’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry and the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department, and disputes surrounding the contract negotiation for Harvard’s graduate student union.
During his speech at Emmanuel College in January, Bacow discussed the challenges universities faced when he was an undergraduate, recounting the 1969 occupation of Harvard’s University Hall by anti-Vietnam protesters and the 1970 firebombing of Tufts.
“Our students are organizing and protesting,” Bacow said. “This time it’s not about war. This time it’s about climate change; it’s about inequality; it’s about sexual assault and harassment—it’s against a whole host of structures and systems that jeopardize the possibility of a future that they believe might be far more just.”
He added that students’ earnestness and passion remind him of his undergraduate years, but that he fears their ire would put the University “in tension” with their values.
Bacow referenced ongoing student protest at Harvard in his March Peking University speech.
“In many circumstances, my role as president is not to define the ‘correct’ position of the University but to keep the channels of discussion open,” Bacow said. “And one of the most important—and most difficult—of our tasks is to ensure that all members of the community feel empowered to speak their minds.”

It had been 755 days — 2 years and 25 days — since Reed Farley last played in a game for Harvard men’s basketball.
But with three minutes to play in the Crimson’s Valentine’s Day contest against Cornell, the 6’4 junior stripped off his warmup shirt, and walked down to the scorer’s table, before entering for his first action since January 20th, 2018. Although the appearance won’t necessarily pop out of the box score or show up in the highlight reel, it was a special moment that was hardly lost on his teammates, friends, and family, who were in the crowd on Friday night.
“It was surreal,” Farley said. “It was a really rewarding and fulfilling moment to be out there with the guys and the Harvard across my chest in front of my family, because there were definitely some times over the past two years when I wondered if it would ever happen again.”
For a player beleaguered by devastating knee injuries that can so often permanently derail a career, Farley’s return represented much more than just another appearance in the game log. And although his only attempt rimmed out from three-point territory, it barely mattered.
For the juniors and seniors that have seen the La Jolla, Ca., native endure an ACL reconstruction, multiple meniscus surgeries, a litany of other medical issues, and two long years of rehab, just his presence was more than enough.
“It’s amazing,” said senior guard Justin Bassey, of seeing Farley take to the Lavietes Pavilion floor once again. “We’ve all been rooting for him, and it’s awesome that he had the opportunity to do that with his family here.”
Of all the qualities that Farley espouses, it’s his steadfastness and consistent emotional boost, that his teammates have come to love and expect from the man who wears No. 33. Over the past two years, the 6’4 guard has been a fixture, his spot on the bench firmly entrenched as he donned coat-and-tie without fail, whether it be at home against UMass or nearly 3,000 miles away at Cal Berkeley. His desire to stay active and involved with the team throughout his rehab has always been on full display. There is perhaps no better example of this than Farley’s repertoire of celebrations, which are frequently captured by cameras and television broadcasts alike. 
“Bringing the energy every time, whether I’m on the court or off it, that was my way of making sure I was staying engaged,” Farley explained. “I wanted to make sure I still felt like I was a contributing member of this team.”
But don’t let his attitude fool you — the road back to the Lavietes Pavilion court has hardly been a smooth one for the junior. A torn ACL in his senior year of high school was just the first in a long series of injuries that would complicate the road to playing basketball again. In his first year in Cambridge, Farley tore his meniscus for the first time in practice, missing the rest of the season and rehabbing for months before tearing it once again shortly after his return. Months of surgeries and rehab turned into years, during a time that the La Jolla, Ca., native openly admitted was emotionally and mentally taxing.
“It’s definitely been a grind, honestly, mentally more than physically,” Farley said of his long recovery. “I did a lot of soul searching, really trying to fight through it and keep going. This is the team that I always wanted to play for, so I never thought I’d give up or give in or anything like that.”
His first appearance back — a modest three minutes off the bench — might not seem that significant, but anyone who’s been around Harvard Basketball, or Farley, knows better. In a way, it was a return to the normalcy of playing basketball, a game that’s taken him to venues as grand as Lexington’s Rupp Arena, where he drilled two three pointers as a freshman against John Calipari’s then-No. 19 Kentucky in front of a crowd of nearly 23,000. 
For Farley, a shooting guard who averaged nearly 20 points per game as a senior in the suburbs of San Diego, playing against Cornell represented the end of a very long road that started over two years ago. His ACL reconstruction, multiple meniscus surgeries, PRP injections, and a removed blood clot are all part of the medical history that make Farley’s reappearance on the court all the more impressive.
“Big moment,” said Coach Tommy Amaker of Farley’s return, citing the team’s collective excitement to see the shooting guard take his place on the court again. “As someone who’s been out for quite some time, and has given a lot to get himself in position to play again.”
It seems appropriate that during this season, a year in which Harvard men’s basketball will seek to exorcise its demons and return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four campaigns, that Farley’s return should come as the Ivy League race heats up. And while his contributions are likely to be more significant from the perspective of being a good teammate, as he’s frequently mentioned as one of the more vocal and intelligent basketball minds shouting instructions from the bench, it remains significant that the junior is once again suiting up.
For all those that consider him a friend or a teammate, seeing No. 33 on the court once again has provided an emotional boost, an inspiration of sorts. And in doing so, Farley hopes he can be a part of something much bigger than himself — a return to March Madness.
With three weeks remaining in the Ivy League season, and the Ivy League Tournament less than a month away, the time for a push is now for a Crimson team that wants to go dancing on Selection Sunday. Harvard is one of five teams that are all separated by just one game in the Ancient Eight standings, but only four of those teams can end up in the playoffs, which will be hosted in Cambridge.
“We know Ivy Basketball is hard, but the team’s starting to understand that we need to come out every night for a fight,” Farley said. “Having four of our last six games at home is great, we love that home court advantage and I think everyone’s fired up.”
It remains to be seen whether or not 2020 will prove to be the year that Coach Amaker’s lauded senior recruiting class finally makes the Big Dance. There are high hopes for a Harvard team that will host Penn and Princeton in absolutely vital matchups this weekend at Lavietes Pavilion.
Many questions about this team and its ability to reach the NCAA Tournament still remain. But whether it’s participating in layup lines, three-point drills, and laughing with his teammates, or calling out screens and defensive instructions from the bench, of one thing, you can be absolutely sure.
After two long years, Reed Farley is exactly where he’s supposed to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite having beaten Rensselaer (RPI) and Union by multi-goal margins in January, Harvard faced significant resistance on the road in Upstate New York. Nonetheless, the Crimson (15-11-1, 14-5-1 ECAC) managed to add a third-period insurance goal against the Engineers (0-31-1, 0-20-0 ECAC) and notched a sudden-death overtime winner against the Dutchwomen (5-22-5, 5-12-3 ECAC). The weekend sweep earns Harvard home-ice advantage for the ECAC quarterfinals, but seeding will depend on this upcoming weekend’s games. With a home win against Clarkson this Friday, the Crimson would guarantee at least the three seed, although the two and four seeds will remain in play as well.
HARVARD 3, UNION 2 (OT)
As the overtime clock ticked below two minutes, the contest between the Crimson and the Dutchwomen loomed towards a tie. Junior forward Becca Gilmore, however, altered the course of the game with a single snipe 3:01 into the extra session. After digging into the corner for the loose puck, sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere found Gilmore in the slot, who held, glided for a moment, and ripped the puck under the bar. The moment that the puck hit the back of the net, Harvard skaters streamed onto the ice.
“It was a good feeling. It was definitely a feeling of relief, but also [we were] happy that we could get that win,” sophomore forward Anne Bloomer said. “We were also really excited about the results of that game as it gave us home ice for playoffs… It’s going to be awesome to host that first round here at Harvard.”
Despite the tight finish, the Crimson never actually trailed in the game, although the two teams were deadlocked for much of the third. Union tied the game with 9:18 remaining in regulation, and both teams would trade chances for the last half period, but to no avail for either squad.
“I think that we knew we had the depth, the confidence, [and] the ability to win this game,” Bloomer said. “Both teams got really good looks to the net. We battled hard, and at the end of regulation, we knew that we had been in this situation before… It just took a bit more patience and a couple more minutes to get it done. I think that’s what characterized those last 10 or so minutes. It was battle, but it was also calm and collected confidence.”
Although the scoring slowed down at the end of the third, the first half of the final frame saw frenetic action. Just 27 seconds into the period, the Dutchwomen knotted the game at one. That said, Harvard pulled ahead again just about two and a half minutes later. Then, as mentioned, Union equalized midway through the last period.
Much of the reason that the Crimson could only muster one goal before the third came down to the play of the Dutchwomen’s senior goaltender Amelia Murray, who would finish the afternoon with 46 saves. Gilmore’s game-clincher, however, would spoil the heroic effort from Murray and grant Harvard its 14th league win.
HARVARD 3, RPI 1
Entering the third period, the Crimson found itself only up by one goal—even though it had earned a 24-9 shots-on-goal advantage in the first two frames. With the game in the balance, however, Della Rovere added some separation that would ice the game. 6:54 into the final stanza, the sophomore forward turned a turnover into a breakaway. Finishing the rush, Della Rovere fired the puck over the outstretched glove of the Engineers’ first-year goalie Ena Nystrøm, giving Harvard the cushion to solidify a win.
“The mentality was to just keep on playing hard,” Bloomer said. “After that third goal, we did have some breathing room, but we didn’t ever want to stop pursuing the net or stop playing defense.”
It is no secret that winless RPI has struggled this season. Nonetheless, the Engineers—who lost 3-0 in their first matchup with the Crimson—have lost 11 games by two goals or less and have never lost by more than five. RPI has remained within striking distance in most of its games, and the trend continued as the team responded to Harvard’s first goal with a second-period equalizer.
“They [RPI] came out right from the start with a bunch of force and an attitude that they were going to be gritty and work as hard as they could to get pucks to the net,” Bloomer said. “They got up for us—they were ready.”
The 1-1 tie game did not last for long, however, as Gilmore—Saturday’s overtime hero—scored the go-ahead goal roughly five minutes later (at the 13:12 mark of the middle frame). Although Della Rovere would capitalize in the third to set the 3-1 final margin, two goals were all that the Crimson would need. Junior goalie Becky Dutton only surrendered one goal on the afternoon, turning away 16 shots in the process. Combined with Saturday’s performance against Union, Dutton earned her fifth win of the year, pushing her record to 5-1 and save percentage to 0.944, albeit in a small sample. With sophomore Lindsay Reed starting the majority of games and senior Beth Larcom appearing five times as well, Harvard has shown remarkable depth at the goaltender position, a trait that should prove critical come playoff time.
“We’re very fortunate here at Harvard to have four really great goalies—people who can step in at any time and fill the role that they need to fill,” Bloomer said. “It’s very reassuring for us. We trust all of our goalies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y. — “The biggest strength of our team is the heart and determination we bring to every match, not just from the starting lineup but to our seventh man,” sophomore Brian Shi said.
The Crimson men certainly brought a certain sense of urgency and resilience to the ECAC tournament this past weekend, coming out with a 4-2 win against Princeton on Saturday, but later losing a hard-fought match in the finals against Cornell, who was playing on its home court, by a score of 1-4.
“We went into the match with the same mentality we’ve had all season,” said first-year Ronan Jachuck of the first match. “[Winning] the ECAC tournament has been a goal that we set out at the end of the fall season as one of our highlights for the season.”
Harvard went down early during the doubles point, as Jachuck and Shi fell to a pair of Princeton athletes 6-1, followed by the pairing of first-year Henry von der Schulenburg and junior Robert Wrzesinski losing its doubles game by a score of 6-3.
“We’ve lost the doubles point a few times this season,” Jachuck said. “So I think the biggest thing was just bouncing back. Losing the point wasn’t a huge dagger.”
Jachuck also cited that because of the trust the team has built up in each other over the course of the year, they were hardly fazed by losing the initial point.
The trust then started to pay off, as the Crimson men began capturing victories on multiple courts. Jachuck was one of the last players on the courts, as he dropped the first set to Princeton’s Karl Poling, 4-6. After the slow start to the match, Jachuck started getting into a rhythm, evening the match out at a set a piece with a 7-6(5) tiebreak win in the second frame.
“At that point, the matches were starting to dwindle down and the crowds were getting a little bigger and my teammates were coming off the court,” Jachuck said. “I remember looking up at [after the winning point at the end of the second set], and then I think the dynamic of the match changed. I definitely had a bit more spring in my step [in the third, and final, set].”
Jachuck went on to come out with a victory in the third set, 6-3, clinching the match for the Harvard men, sending them to their third straight ECAC final against Cornell.
On Sunday afternoon, the Crimson came out swinging, with von der Schulenburg and Wrzesinski winning, 6-4, and the duo of sophomores Steven Sun and Harris Walker taking their game by a convincing 6-1 margin, securing the doubles point that Harvard had failed to get in the previous match against Princeton.
“Our number two and three doubles teams played great matches and brought amazing energy, which is crucial especially against a team with a large crowd on their side,” Shi said. “There’s still quite a bit of work to be done on the doubles front, but I know for a fact that come Ivy [League Championship] season we will continue to come out with more and more doubles points.”
After the doubles point, however, Cornell started to gain some steam, as Big Red junior Eero Vasa defeated Jachuck on the first court in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4. Harvard did not go down without a fight, as Shi battled hard against on the second court, followed by von der Schulenburg taking another Cornell athlete to three sets, but the Crimson failed to secure a victory on the singles courts.
Despite shortcomings in the latter part of the match, Shi, and other members of the team, found a lot of positives to take away from the match.
“Our team is so close-knit and we want to fight hard so that we can win not just for ourselves, but for our teammates on the court to the left and right of us,” Shi said. “That’s what really allows us to bring such high energy to each match up and down the lineup, and at the end of the day, we weren’t able to come up with the win, but we played with heart which we can all be very proud of.”
Shi also noted that although the team was very disappointed by the result of the tournament, this might have been just what they needed to reach even bigger goals.
“We have so much talent on this team and we are capable of doing so much this season. This match is a very small speed bump in what will surely be an incredible next few months,” Shi said. “Being this was only our first loss of the season so far, I know that each and every one of us will train even harder and come back even more motivated than ever before.”
While dreams of an undefeated season are now over, a fire has bit lit under the Harvard athletes as they prepare for upcoming matches and championship season with bigger chips on their shoulders than before.
“Although it would’ve been nice to hold up the ECACs trophy, there is so much more to look forward to [Ivy League and NCAA Championship season],” Shi said. “We are all already looking forward to getting our revenge in the upcoming Ivy season.”

Regardless of your individual email habits and preferences, you likely wake up to a massive flood of emails: piles and piles of “unread” messages from students you’ve never met and organizations you’ve never heard of. While it’s satisfying to just swipe those emails directly into the trash, once in a while you come across a diamond in the rough, featuring a professor’s answer to your frantic 3 a.m. question about the p-set that you should have started a week ago. Besides these “gem” emails, we can all agree that the majority of emails make us regret adding our emails to Visitas lists all those years ago. Without further ado, to all the emails we’ve deleted before…
The Canvas Email
There’s nothing like the immediate fight-or-flight reaction that rushes through your body at the sight of “assignment X has been graded.” Sure, we appreciate the notification, but we don’t need to be constantly reminded of the psets due this week or the uploading of lecture slides we just slept through. We recommend taking a look at Canvas notification settings and adjusting them accordingly.
The LinkedIn Email
We, too, would love to join the LinkedIn network of that random person from high school, but do we need an email to remind us? And if LinkedIn wants to let us know that we appeared in a search recently, we would appreciate the tea on who searched us without having to upgrade to LinkedIn Pro.
The [HOUSE LIST] Email
Yes, house emails could theoretically foster a sense of community through widespread communication, but the only emails we really care about are the ones that tell us where to find free cookies on campus. Hm, if only there was an email list that specifically announced where to find free food on campus (shout-out to Harvard Today).
