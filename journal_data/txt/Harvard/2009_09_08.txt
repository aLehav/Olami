After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So much for change. In the wake of the mortgage-market fiasco, in which get-rich-quick schemes alchemized in the cubicles and conference rooms of Broad Street translated into a meltdown of the international financial system, bankers have been looking for new markets to tap. But despite all talk of a new approach to the future of finance, the reality is that the most recent innovations are only geared to resurrect the same old broken system.
This past Sunday, The New York Times reported on one of the financial industry’s newest tactics—to securitize not mortgages, but bought-out life insurance policies. Wall Street firms buy policies from holders, continuing to pay monthly premiums until the original policyholder dies and the firm collects the life insurance money. The way in which these policies are bundled and sold as derivatives is suspiciously reminiscent of the way mortgage-backed securities were sold to investors. Upping the ante even more is a whole new set of ethical implications that comes with buying and selling life insurance policies on a wide market.
Wall Street argues, albeit on weak ground, that the new model does in fact learn from the lessons of the last decade. In the mortgage-backed security market, subprime loans functioned as adversely selected “lemons,” and the mortgages most likely to fail were the ones most likely to compromise the integrity of the securitized assets. In this new market of life insurance securities, it is instead the healthy insurance candidates who are the liability. This time, to offer life insurance to the physically unhealthy—in other words, the “subprime”—candidates is to actually back the interests of bankers interested in making a quick return on their investment. For banks to buy out policies from candidates near death is a sure payout. Just as loans were once urged on subprime candidates in the drive to expand the base of mortgages for securitization, nothing now stops Wall Street from engineering a way to encourage the sick and elderly to take out life insurance plans—before buying out these plans for repackaging and investment. 
But more than just this economic difference, a big ethical distinction exists between tampering with the mortgage market and with the life insurance market. In an increasingly interconnected business world in which the financial industry is never more than a BlackBerry’s call away from the health insurance industry, conflicts of interest are bound to arise. As the two legislative battles of the summer—financial regulation and health-care reform—have shown, the two industries are alike in their greed, ambition, and self-interest. Collusion is in the best interest of both sides: Insurance companies are encouraged to drop health care, and policyholders know that mortality ensures an even bigger payout for Wall Street. And so who better than health insurance companies to invest in these new asset-backed securities? More than merely “killing Grandma,” now someone’s getting a fat check when she croaks.
Indeed, with mortgage securitization, at least banks intervened in the right to property by way of extending mortgage credit to those otherwise unable to own a home; however corrupt the practice was in hindsight, at least a positive externality existed. But, life insurance securitization is far worse, an encroachment on Locke’s natural rights: life and liberty. To sell a financial underwriter your life insurance policy is like circulating a trading card among investors—one that cashes in when you die. Until then, it merely functions as a liability for the underwriter and investors, equally an asset and a death wish. 
More than mere financial regulation, real responsibility on the part of bankers and those on Wall Street is needed, given the absurdity of inventions flowing from these banks. Just because something can be securitized does not mean that Wall Street ought to underwrite it. Financial engineering must be constructive and bear value not just to financial firms, but also to the inherent goals of the world of finance—providing credit and financing to firms and households. The industry’s latest ideas seem more like “Modest Proposals” than serious pitches, more tongue-in-cheek ways to expose the industry’s greed than earnest ideas to provide financial services. The future will certainly be grim if, in the drive to resurrect the financial markets, reason and ethics are further abandoned along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, the issue of texting while driving was everywhere, appearing as the subject of editorial cartoons, news stories, and even legislative action: 18 states have now passed laws banning the practice, up from only six at the beginning of the year. Texting may owe its spot in the national debate to the ascendance of Twitter, as drivers turned to their cell phones to trade messages about the Iranian election or the whereabouts of David Lynch or Diddy. Perhaps crucially, the widespread use of smartphones makes texting far easier because of built-in keyboards. But whatever the cause, texting while driving is a danger to society, and Congress should act to stop it by banning the practice nationwide, imposing strict penalties, and launching an informational campaign to educate the country about its dangers. 
Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that texting makes driving—an already dangerous activity—much more accident-prone. A study released by Virginia Tech found that the risk of an accident increases 23 times. A casual test by Car and Driver magazine, performed in actual cars, found that drivers who were texting reacted far more slowly than when under the influence of alcohol.
Despite national attention, simultaneous text messaging and driving remains legal in much of the country. A national ban may deter many potential text messagers, especially if the penalty for causing an accident while texting rivaled that of drunk driving, like the law passed last month by the Utah legislature that could send offenders to prison for 15 years. But while such a law may help ensure that perpetrators get the penalty they deserve, it may save few lives. Texters who get lucky and avoid an accident will be hard to detect, since phones are small and many hold theirs in their lap.
The airwaves have been filled with proposals to prevent texting while driving. One proposed solution is to require all car manufacturers to disable cellphone use while the car is in motion. Cellphone-jamming technology not only exists, but it can also easily be made portable and moderately precise. But this approach is unnecessarily invasive, may prevent crucial emergency calls, and could be prohibitively expensive to implement retroactively.
Other services are on the market that detect whether a cell phone is in motion using GPS technology and shut off texting services accordingly. But whether the product comes in the form of software on the phone or a special car key that communicates with the phone via Bluetooth, these products are unreliable, and determined teens would find a way to subvert such electronic safeguards.
Though technology appears to lie at the cause of the problem, we cannot turn to technology as a solution. As mobile technology continues to improve, texting will likely be superseded by some distraction we have yet to discover. If we try to prevent texting accidents with electronic blocks, it could mean the start of an arms race we are unlikely to win.
Instead, the approach to preventing accidents due to cellphone use should borrow from strategies used to combat drunk driving. Years of propaganda from government agencies and well-meaning non-profits like Mothers Against Drunk Driving have helped dramatically change cultural attitudes about drinking and driving. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey found that only 2.2 percent of nighttime weekend drivers were drunk in 2007, down from 7.5 percent in the 1970s.
A comprehensive program to educate drivers about the dangers of texting and other distractions must be part of any future driving safety legislation. Teenagers need to learn about the risks of cellphone use in driver’s education classes and potentially in high-school civics or human-development classes as well. The government should also purchase TV and radio advertisements warning about distracted driving. Gory public services announcements will help in the short term, but we should also try to send messages that reinforce good behavior, such as praising those who don’t text by calling them smart drivers or responsible citizens.
To maximize its effectiveness, a national bill on cellphone use in cars should be enacted quickly. While text messaging has been around for a decade, its recent proliferation means that etiquette is still changing and attitudes toward acceptable behavior are still receptive to molding. Americans need to get the message immediately that texting while driving is seriously unsafe, lest the notion that one must text back immediately, no matter the activity, become a permanent part of our culture.
Admittedly, changing attitudes about phone use may be harder than stopping drunk drivers. Alcohol is already illegal for drivers under 21 and was widely known to impair reflexes since long before the emergence of the automobile. Text messaging, on the other hand, is not only relatively new and fashionable but also marketed for its convenience. Yet the fact that the dangers of texting while driving are not always clear provides the most compelling reason why an aggressive informational campaign to expose them is necessary.
The online debate over a national bill has been largely focused on the notion that a federal ban might be unconstitutional, but there are few reasons to support that claim. At the very least, the federal government could withhold funding from states which fail to pass cellphone usage laws. The underlying concern these people face is that such a law would unduly restrict their freedom. 
This complaint is entirely legitimate. However, in the case of text messaging, the temptation is so insidious that people cannot be fully trusted to decide for themselves whether it is safe to text behind the wheel. Besides, with so many lives at stake, is it really that much trouble to just pull over?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember the exact moment when I opened my inbox at an Internet café in Nairobi to see a forwarded e-mail from Marilyn Hausammann, Vice President for Human Resources at Harvard. Painstakingly slow, the page loaded with Hausammann’s announcement of the impending elimination of 275 staff positions. I had been in Kenya for only two weeks, and everything about the thickness of the air, the dirt under my fingernails, and stickiness of the keyboard reminded me of how many thousands of miles I was away from Harvard. I felt disempowered and unable to voice my opinion about the decision.  
Now that I have returned, these 275 jobs are a thing of the past. I cannot go back in time, but neither can I accept Harvard’s layoffs, or the most recent hours reductions, that bring workers below a living wage. Harvard must strive to bring these members of the community back to a living wage while finding additional ways of cutting costs that do not jeopardize the jobs and lives of the people who make up this institution. 
According to union representatives within Harvard, the administration’s most recent budget-cut tactic has been to implement hour reductions among staff while still expecting essentially the same amount of work to be done in less time. Although hour reductions appear to be a compromise, and perhaps a better option than layoffs, reducing hours continues to ask the lowest-paid workers at Harvard to bear an inequitable share of the financial burden. Staffers are physically strained by the work, and financially strained by the reduction in pay. Although hours reductions are preferable to layoffs because workers retain health benefits along with their continued paychecks, cutting the hours of people who already struggle to make ends meet circumvents the successes of the 2001 Living Wage Campaign. Therefore, although it is possible to see hour reductions as a win for workers, we must not accept them as a permanent solution.
Now that students have returned to campus, it is essential that we not forget the challenges facing the lowest-paid members of our community. Students must remain vigilant of the fact that the university seems to deliberately deceive us on issues involving budget cuts. It is apparent that administrators were merely waiting for students to leave campus before beginning layoffs. Although I had been warned of this, I still felt deceived by leaders of my university, who, weeks before, had shooed away concerns about layoffs by insisting that nothing had been decided and that we need not continue to pester them about layoffs because they simply had not happened. I recognize that there are, and were, many unknowns in this challenging financial crisis, but the administration’s approach demonstrated a failure of moral leadership. 
How do students remain vigilant when we are often excluded from the decision-making processes surrounding Harvard’s budget? The first and most obvious way is to maintain our human and personal connections with all people who live and work at Harvard. Whether it means talking with someone who works in your dining hall or stopping to catch up with the janitor you’ve seen in the Science Center, you may learn that someone you see every day has lost an eighth of her salary and can no longer afford to pay rent. These human interactions are a key ingredient to having a respectful community, but they also contribute to the public’s understanding of how administrative decision-making affects real people. 
If we know the personal stories and struggles that have emerged from this financial crisis, we may find ourselves more understanding and more dedicated to keeping the people of this university community together. Harvard workers are not a homogenous monolith with the same story, perspective, or needs, but they are individuals whom we can and should know personally and whose struggles we can and should work to alleviate. Students are not the whole answer to the challenges facing Harvard workers, but given that most of us are now back on campus, and as students we do not face the worries of being fired, we ought to be use our position to lobby for the rest of our community. Get involved with social-justice groups, write to administrators, attend rallies, and, most importantly, communicate with the people around you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of about fifty student members of the Harvard College Democrats turned out yesterday morning for the “Health Care Can’t Wait” Rally in Boston Common  in a  show of support for the comprehensive reform bill expected to come before Congress this fall.
Several thousand people turned out for the rally, which included presentations from four Congressmen and testimonials from a janitor, a doctor, a security officer, and a nurse. The event was sponsored by Organizing for America, which President Obama founded in Jan. to advance his administration’s policy agenda, and the progressive advocacy group, Health Care for America Now.
In Washington, moderate and progressive Democrats are still wrangling over the details of the bill, but the speakers at the Saturday event invoked the memory of the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 to push for keeping the controversial “public option” provision in the final bill.
The Dems gathered in the morning on Monday carrying signs, coffee, and bagged lunches. They departed for Boston after a brief stump speech by President Eva Z. Lam ’10 in front of the John Harvard statue.
Lam encouraged the students to avoid engaging with protestors, in reference to the raucous protests that dominated the town-hall meetings held by members of congress in August. She joked that the group should “stash their guns,” before the rally.
But not all shied away from a heated debate. Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 welcomed engagement on the bill, calling the health care debate “the fight of our generation.”
“The status quo is literally not an option. We’re here to support Barack Obama and his push for change,” he said.
Lam emphasized the significance of health care coverage for young people, as she said the 18-29 age bracket is the most likely group not to have health insurance. 
“I think that people are starting to realize that this matters to us, and this is the best chance we’ve had in making a significant change to the health care system since 1994,” she said. 
At the rally, the Harvard contingent was particularly boisterous during a speech by Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, who has not publicly come out in favor of a public health insurance option. Harvard students were among the first to begin a chant of “Public option: do we have your vote?” that eventually drowned out the Congressman’s speech and led him to leave the microphone.
The student turnout was brought about by an intensive, week-long effort by the Dems to ensure Harvard’s involvement in the rally. According to Lam, members of the Dems knocked on every freshman door to encourage attendance. They also pushed members of the Dems to bring “roommates, friends, neighbors, and random people they met in the dining hall,” Lam said.

The Undergraduate Council’s Capital Campaign—conceived last spring in an effort to purchase property for a new student center—closed the summer having raised $700 toward the effort. The campaign narrowly covered expenses with the help of an initial sum of $3,000 from the UC surplus budget and $4,000 in miscellaneous donations solicited before the summer began, but failed to meet the ambitious goals laid out in May. On Thursday, UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 announced in an e-mail to the student body that the campaign would no longer operate under the auspices of the UC, and would continue its operations as an independent organization. During the last meeting of the academic year, the Council narrowly voted 15-13 to begin a 16-month effort to purchase the multi-million dollar 45 Mt. Auburn St. property for use as a student community center. The tense meeting left the council’s leadership divided with UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 coming out in strong support of the proposal, even after Flores had publicly expressed reservations about the cost and the feasibility of the plan. The UC initially hired four non-UC student staffers, who received a small stipend for their work. By mid-July, none of the four student staffers remained working full-time for the project, according to Joshua J. Nuni ’10 in an e-mail over the UC-General list on July 15. The campaign efforts were sustained through volunteer work for the rest of the summer. According to a financial document obtained by The Crimson, the campaign only raised enough funds to cover the operating expenses for the summer—totaling $8,050. “When the UC voted for the capital campaign, there was the expectation that money would be raised this summer,” said Flores in an interview with The Crimson yesterday. “The campaign was not successful because there was no money raised.” Flores added that she was “concerned that the sponsors of the legislation did not work as passionately to implement the project as they did to pass the project.” But Nuni, who spearheaded the proposal in the spring, insists that although the capital campaign did not raise funds for the purchase of the property, the work done over the summer was important for building the “foundation for a successful project.” “We didn’t really solicit donations [this summer] because we weren’t ready,” said Nuni in an interview on Sunday. “We didn’t really recognize how much work had to be done to make [fundraising] a feasible operation.” According to Nuni, the students working on the campaign took about a month and a half “to get to the point where we could articulate our vision in a concise, compelling way.” Summer work on the capital campaign included outlining management changes, meetings with Harvard alumni, the administration, and student group leaders to garner support for the project. In addition the group met with a local architect, construction companies, and real estate agents to discuss potential options and plans for the physical building including the proposed acquisition of 45 Mt. Auburn St. After the upcoming elections for this year’s new UC representatives, the Council will vote on a proposal that transfers the management of the Student Community Center Capital Campaign to the separate, non-profit Student Community Center Foundation, which will eventually manage the operations of the student center rather than the College administration. It is expected to be comprised of students, faculty, alumni, and community members. —Staff writer Melody Y. Hu can be reached at melodyhu@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Brittany M.

Cambridge Street, located near the busy Lechmere T-station, is home to quaint row houses and small businesses, but behind the brown wooden door of a 150-year-old house lay a newly discovered skeleton, buried with a century-old gun.
Construction workers who were building a back porch between the house, which is owned by Rosalie Foster, and an adjacent building, discovered the bones and gun on Thursday, according to the Boston Herald.
Nick Stamos, the owner of Fresh Start Contracting, told the Herald that his workers discovered the bones below the concrete foundations of a shed that once sat behind the home.
“At that point I thought the best thing to do was to call the police,” Stamos said.
Anjali Lohani ’08, a former Crimson editor who lives in the adjacent building, recalled returning home on an otherwise normal Thursday evening. 
“My roommates and I weren’t even aware that anything had happened until our landlord called us,” Lohani said. “We were told not to go into the backyard, because it was a crime scene.”
Yesterday, yellow police tape was draped along a tall wooden fence below the connecting porch.
The construction workers, who began work last Wednesday, have not returned to the site since the discovery. “I’m not sure when construction will resume,” Lohani said.
Foster told the Associated Press that the discovery was “unbelievable at first, and then it gets a little shocky and then you go ‘Wow, I got a body!’”
She could not be reached by The Crimson for further comment.
Cambridge police spokesman Frank Pasquarello told the AP that forensic examinations are expected to reveal the age and gender of the skeletal remains, which appears to be about 100 years old.
Though investigations are still underway, The Boston Globe reported on Friday that police believe the skeletal remains may not be from a human, as was initially thought.
Foster has been told by police that she can keep the ancient gun because the object was discovered on her property.

Harvard’s trash output more than doubled during the first few days of move-in this year, peaking well above the 10 tons it posts during a typical three-day period, according to Michael D. Conner, communications manager for University Operations Services.
20.31 tons of recyclable cardboard, bottles, cans, and paper were picked up in the days immediately following move-in, Conner said.
But the boxes and recyclables students discard during the move-in process are not simply loaded into a truck and sent to the dump to deteriorate alongside rusty cars and Styrofoam. 
Instead, the boxes become part of Harvard’s sustainability effort—a system that “goes way beyond the walls of our campus” and allows more than half of Harvard’s discarded goods to be recycled, according to Robert Gogan, recycling and waste services manager for Facilities Maintenance Operations. 
Harvard owns five recycling trucks of its own, but during intense garbage periods like move-in, Gogan said the University contracts additional trucks to handle the initial volume.
“Our recycling trucks are always roaming around,” Conner said, “[but during opening days] we increase it a bit just because the volume is so much.”
During move-in period, recycling trucks work at least 12 hours a day making sweeps of undergraduate residences, Conner said. Once the quantity of trash falls back to normal levels, the truck cycle will be reduced, he said.
The trucks drive Harvard’s recycling—everything from a freshman’s  mini-fridge box to a discarded Ec 10 syllabus—to FCR Casella, a processing plant in Charlestown, MA, roughly three miles from campus. 
There the recyclables are sorted so that they can be sold to different companies to produce new products. The discarded Ec 10 syllabus, for example, becomes part of the fibers for Crane’s stationery—a company with which FCR Casella does business.
Last year, Harvard University generated roughly 7,500 tons of trash and 8,500 tons of recycling and composting, according to Conner. The resulting 55% recycling rate put Harvard at the top of the Ivy League in terms of recycling, he said. 
“For a research university, that is really good,” Gogan said.
The push for recycling is not only an environmentally friendly endeavor—it is also an economically savvy one. Disposing of garbage in a trash disposal costs the University $87 per ton, but according to Gogan, recycling a ton currently costs the University less than half that amount—about $35 a month.
“We save $52 for every ton we are able to recycle instead of discard as trash,” Gogan said. “So we do have to pay for it, but it is less than we would have paid to get it land-filled.”
Though Gogan does much to ensure that the University is sustainable on a macro level, others pitch in to keep the day-to-day operations in order. 
“My job is to ensure that we capture the most possible composting and recycling,” said David A. Seley of Harvard University Dining Services, who directs students on how to dispose of their plates and silverware at outdoor events where food is served, such as Aloha Harvard and the Activities Fair. 
According to Seley, the University’s systems have been developed to “maximize” how much of the eating accoutrements are recycled, including the wide-spread use of compostable plates, silverware, and napkins at University dining facilities.

For the first 30 minutes of its season-opening match against Stony Brook on Friday afternoon, the Harvard men’s soccer team looked nothing like the team that is expected to make its fourth-straight NCAA tournament appearance and once again challenge for the Ivy League title. The Crimson could not get anything going offensively, constantly giving away possession to the Seawolves (0-2). And in the 28th minute, Stony Brook freshman Berien Gobeil ran right through the Harvard midfield and rifled a shot from over 30 yards out into the top left corner. Questions about the team’s ability to replace the creative influences of Mike Fucito ’09 and John Stamatis ’09 suddenly loomed even larger.
Luckily for the Crimson, two fresh faces were on scene to make sure that their first game in a Harvard uniform did not end in disappointment. Seven minutes  after Gobeil’s goal, freshman Scott Prozeller linked up with classmate Brian Rogers to even the score at one. 
The Crimson (1-0) would go on to dominate the second half and take away a 4-1 victory from its season opener.
“We started off slow in the first half—maybe it was a little nerves, maybe it was a little excitement,” co-captain Andre Akpan said. “But we got that goal before halftime ,which was important, and we came out ready to play in the second half.”
Akpan—recently listed as one of the top collegiate soccer players by ESPN, College Soccer News, and Soccer America—scored twice in the first eight minutes of the second half, and senior winger Desmond Mitchell added a fourth in the 73rd minute to put the game out of reach.
“We got caught in a lull when we lost that first goal, and then we had to dig our way out,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “But we did a great job by responding right away, and then in the second half we were fantastic.”
After falling behind, Clark made two immediate changes that helped turn the game around: bringing on Mitchell and sophomore Jaren LaGreca, and moving Prozeller up to midfield. 
But the most strategic substitution may have come five minutes prior to Stony Brook’s goal, when Clark sent on Rogers for his first collegiate match. Much is expected of Rogers, and the speedy striker did not take long to show everyone in attendance that he intends to live up to the hype.
In the 35th minute, Rogers latched onto a great pass from fellow freshman Prozeller, who had slotted next to co-captain Brian Grimm in midfield. Rogers darted by the Seawolves’ defense on the right side, finding himself one-on-one with the Stony Brook keeper. Rogers shot early, lifting the ball into the top left corner to even the score.
“Before the game, [Akpan] put a lot of pressure on me,” Rogers said. “He said, ‘This is the first step to breaking all my records.’ So it was a big weight off all my shoulders when I saw that ball go in. 
“It felt like it was in the air for an eternity,” he added.
“I think he’s one of the five best freshman forwards in the country,” Clark said of Rogers. “He scores—that’s the name of his game. He gets in behind defenses, he gets on the ends of balls…and once he gets behind the defense, no one’s going to catch him.”
Prozeller, a Sudbury, Mass. native, joined the squad as the heir-apparent to Grimm in the holding role in midfield. But Prozeller quickly showed his ability to flourish in a more attack-minded function, picking up his first collegiate assist.
Playing a more direct brand of soccer, the Crimson dominated the final exchanges of the first half and continued to bombard the Seawolves’ goal after the break. 
Five minutes into the second half, junior Alex Chi fought off multiple Stony Brook defenders to win a free kick right outside the Seawolves’ box. Akpan curled the ball beautifully around the wall and into the bottom right corner to give Harvard the lead. 
Akpan doubled his tally for the season a few minutes later by heading the ball into the same corner of the net off a cross from the right side.
The relentless Crimson attack struck again for its fourth and final goal when Akpan sent a ball over the Stony Brook defense and Mitchell finished with a skillful lob.
“We believe that we are one of the top 20 teams in the country, but you have to impose it on other teams,” Clark said. “It’s hard when you play against a team that has already played a game and are just a little sharper to begin with. But by the end of the game we were fresher and more composed.”

The Harvard men’s soccer team capped off its opening weekend emphatically yesterday, shutting out Boston College, 2-0, on the Eagles’ home turf in Newton, Mass.  The non-conference win over the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Boston College (1-2-0) was the first for Harvard (2-0-0) since 2000.“We played really well,” Crimson co-captain Akpan said. “It was a tough road game against an ACC team and I think our team had a solid overall performance.”The Crimson entered the matchup following a decisive 4-1 victory over Stony Brook this past Friday, where Akpan set a new Harvard record in career points.  But the Crimson was unable to rest on its laurels as it prepared to meet the Eagles, a member of one of the most competitive conferences in the country.“We knew we were going to get a test of where we stand against the whole country,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said.  “It’s a very positive early indication of where we are.”Although Boston College led the Crimson in shots on goal, gunning for the Harvard net 17 times while the Crimson rattled off 14 attempts, the visiting team’s defense was impenetrable. A decisive Crimson effort led by sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms—who recorded two saves during the game—kept this strong Eagles attack at bay.“The team played great for the majority of the game,” senior midfielder Desmond Mitchell said. “We controlled the ball for most of the game and we were able to contain Boston to very few chances, while we had a lot of chances ourselves.”On the offensive side, the Crimson’s underclassmen took charge.  Freshman Scott Prozeller and sophomore Jamie Rees registered both of the team’s goals, while Akpan assisted both efforts and freshman Brian Rogers added an assist to his résumé.“The underclassmen that played did very well,” Mitchell said.  “While we do have a lot of upperclassmen playing on the field, all the underclassmen playing are contributing a fair amount to the team as well.”Prozeller started the scoring for Harvard, recording his first goal in crimson and white in the 21st minute of play. Prozeller found the net on Boston College fellow freshman Justin Luthy, shooting from five yards out on an Akpan assist.The Crimson later increased its lead over the Eagles to 2-0 with only seconds left in the first half,  when Rees scored his first goal of the season off of a cross and redirect from Akpan and Rogers at 44:16.Both teams remained scoreless for the remainder of the game.The last meeting of the two cross-town rivals occurred in 2001 and was also held at the Eagles’ Newton Campus Complex.  But the outcome of that matchup was far better for the home team—then-unranked Boston College trumped the visiting No. 18 Crimson, 3-2.This year, the Crimson emerged victorious on the strength of a balanced effort from its seasoned veterans and rising stars.“The team’s been great—we really came together,” said Mitchell.  “From the freshmen to the sophomores to the juniors to the seniors, we’re all working well together, and we’re all working together for one cause.”—Staff writer Alexandra J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of preparation and grueling two-a-days, Harvard men’s water polo hit the pool looking to make a splash. Instead, the squad sputtered in its first action of the season at the MIT Invitational this past weekend.Ten different players found the back of the net for the Crimson (0-3), but Harvard dropped all of its contests, falling to No. 13 Pacific, 17-4, Claremont 10-9, and Redlands, 15-7, at the Al and Barrie Zesiger Sports and Fitness center.“[This weekend] there have been a lot of good steps,” Harvard coach Eric Farrar said. “We showed that we’ve got the talent, but it’s a question of putting it all together, and we weren’t entirely successful in doing that.”While the Crimson showed flashes of potential, particularly in goal, co-captain Egen Atkinson suggested that Harvard will be able to put more pieces together as the squad adjusts to new offensive schemes.“Lack of practice with our offensive system is one of the main things [that we need to improve],” he commented. “On defense we know what we need to run, but offensively we still need to develop a few things.”REDLANDS 15, HARVARD 7Looking to bounce back from two difficult losses on Saturday, the Crimson took on the Bulldogs (2-2) Sunday afternoon hoping for its first win of the season. Harvard earned a 2-1 advantage early, but the Redlands squad settled into a rhythm, riding a 15-4 edge in ejections to a 9-3 halftime lead.Seven different players tallied goals for the Crimson—including co-captains Atkinson, junior Bret Voith, and freshman utility man Max Eliot—but Harvard could not close the gap.Senior goalkeeper Nikhil Balaraman notched seven saves and five steals in net to finish a promising weekend and provide a rare bright spot for the struggling Crimson.“Nikhil was phenomenal,” Atkinson said. “I was encouraged to see how strong he is in goal. [Balaraman] is great fundamentally, but just as importantly, he is a strong leader on defense.”Senior Dan Furman also made a positive return to the pool, netting his first goal of the season against the Bulldogs.CLAREMONT 10, HARVARD 9The Crimson concluded Saturday’s action with a disappointing loss as the squad watched a two-goal lead evaporate in the second half.The offense clicked early for Harvard en route to a 6-4 lead, but a series of third quarter miscues opened the door for a 6-0 run by the Stags.“That [Claremont game] was the toughest loss to swallow, because it was within our reach,” Atkinson said. “We were feeling good, but in the third quarter we lost focus…Hopefully one of the things we will learn is how to finish a game like that.”Voith tallied a hat trick for the Crimson, while Atkinson notched a pair of scores, nearly rallying Harvard to a late comeback. Unfortunately for the Crimson, time expired before the squad could line up a good final look.A strong returning core of sophomores also got into Saturday’s action, with Luka Babic, Mike Katzer and Evan Zepfel all adding scores for Harvard.NO. 13 PACIFIC 17, HARVARD 4The 13th-ranked Tigers proved too much for the Crimson in the Cambridge squad’s first contest of the year. Juniors Jeff Lee and Alex Thompson along with sophomore Luka Babic each scored their first goals of the weekend in the opening matchup, but Harvard consistently found itself in a hole against a talented Pacific team.“Pacific is a great team,” Atkinson explained, “And it was good to go out and get better against a team like that.”Sophomore goalie Alex Popp shined against the Tigers, posting eight saves and providing coach Farrar with the luxury of two solid options between the posts.“[Popp and Balaraman] have done a fantastic job so far,” Farrar said. “Both have been very solid and I imagine they will each see significant playing time.”—Staff writer Max N.

The Harvard women’s volleyball team showed promise in its first tournament of the season last weekend. Hosting the Harvard Invitational at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson won its first two matches—defeating Colgate, 3-2, and Stony Brook, 3-1—and dropped its final game to Toledo, 3-1.“We got better all weekend,” Harvard coach Jen Weiss said. “We improved in so many ways in our offensive and defensive system.”TOLEDO 3, HARVARD 1In its final match of the weekend, the Crimson faced the undefeated Rockets (6-0). After winning the first set, Harvard dropped three straight for its only defeat of the tournament.After the Crimson opened a 23-13 lead in the first frame, Toledo responded by winning 10 of the next 11 points. Sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll closed out the set with a kill to give Harvard a 1-0 lead, but the Crimson had lost its momentum. The Rockets then cruised in the second set, 25-11.“If you watch [Toldeo], when they get in system, they play every point all the way through,” Weiss said. “Their block really got established on us into that second game and we weren’t running the offense that we wanted to.”Harvard dropped the third set, 25-20, and trailed 22-17 in the fourth frame, but it rallied late. A kill by senior co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn followed by consecutive aces from Ingersoll cut the lead to 22-20. Two kills from sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer and one from freshman Jennifer Martin, mixed in with two points for the Rockets, brought the score to 24-23. A Toledo kill clinched the match on the next point.HARVARD 3, STONY BROOK 1In its second match, the Crimson squared off against the Seawolves (1-6) and rolled to a 3-1 win.“We did awesome,” Weiss said. “We played really well and kept Stony Brook out of system.”Harvard gathered an early lead, winning the first two sets, 25-19 and 25-23, before dropping the third set, 25-20.In the fourth frame, the Crimson jumped out to a 10-3 lead and did not look back, winning the set, 25-18, to clinch the match.Three Harvard players reached double digits in kills. Freshman Taylor Docter led with 14 kills, followed by Ingersoll with 13 and junior Mikaelle Comrie with 12. Senior Lily Durwood directed the offense, registering 47 assists, and Christine Wu carried the defense with 23 digs.HARVARD 3, COLGATE 2In front of a raucous crowd on Friday night, the Crimson (2-1) began its season with a five-set thriller against the Raiders (1-3). Trailing 2-1 after three sets, Harvard built a 23-19 advantage in the fourth frame only to see Colgate fight back and whittle the lead down to 24-23. Needing a point to advance to a fifth set, Durwood set up Comrie for a kill that landed just inbounds. The assist Durwood’s 47th on the evening.“Lily did a great job running the offense,” Weiss said. “She tried to spread it out and move the hitters…that was the goal”In the deciding set, the Crimson and Raiders were tied at 13 when Ingersoll took over. On the next two points, Durwood set Ingersoll up for resounding kills that clinched Harvard’s first victory of the season.“It just happened to be me,” Ingersoll said. “If anything, it was really important that I do my part and be up to take the blockers away so that [Durwood] could have the option to set outside or whatever she needed to do to get the kill.”Ingersoll recorded a .346 hitting percentage and finished with 12 kills, second only to Docter, who notched 18.“For her first collegiate game [Docter] did a wonderful job,” Weiss said. “It’s a hard thing to do but she got herself comfortable. She’s had a great preseason, so I had the confidence she would develop her game, and she did wonderfully.”—Staff writer Timothy J. Walsh can be reached at twalsh@fas.harvard.edu.

Despite a 2008 season in which he scored 10 goals, became the Harvard men’s soccer team’s all-time leader in points, and was named both a First-Team All American and a semi-finalist for college soccer’s top honor, Andre Akpan felt that he underachieved. “I don’t want to say that I had a bad season, but it’s definitely something I want to improve upon next year,” Akpan said last December.One of the main reasons for his disappointment was a slow start, in which he failed to find the net in any of the team’s opening four matches.Now a co-captain, Akpan entered his senior campaign determined to come out of the gates firing.So his weekend’s tally of two goals and three assists in the Crimson’s first two matches—both wins—was sure to please the striker as well as his teammates and coach.“He’s gotten off to a hot start, and that’s what our team needs right now to get wins,” co-captain Brian Grimm said.“Andre is a notoriously slow starter, so to get him on the board early is fantastic,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “We know he always comes good in October, but this will be a huge boost for him.”The first half of the Crimson’s opening match against Stony Brook was a struggle for the Harvard offense. The second half, though, belonged to Akpan. With the score knotted at one, the Grand Prairie, Texas native stepped up his game and led the Crimson to victory, scoring twice and adding an assist.Five minutes into the second half, Akpan gave Harvard the lead when he found the bottom right corner following a free kick right outside the penalty box. Too close to the goal to be able to shoot over the wall, Akpan coolly curled the ball around it, placing it perfectly into the side netting.His second came just three minutes later when he found some space in the box and latched onto a cross from the right side, heading the ball powerfully past the Stony Brook keeper.Akpan added an assist in the victory on Friday, and continued to set up his teammates in Monday’s 2-0 win over Boston College.In the 22nd minute, Akpan made a run into the box and found freshman Scott Prozeller, who opened the scoring against the Eagles. Right before halftime, the Crimson added a second, when Akpan’s one-touch play allowed sophomore Jamie Rees to score his first goal in a Harvard uniform.The seven points that Akpan collected from the two games took him past the century mark in career points, and he now sits at 104. For his weekend’s efforts, Akpan was named the Ivy League’s Co-Player of the Week.The accolade is just the most recent of a long list that he has already accumulated this year. After being named a semifinalist for the Hermann Trophy—awarded to the top collegiate soccer player—last season, the Missouri Athletic Club put Akpan on its watch list for this season. Akpan was also named in College Soccer News’ Preseason All-America First Team and Soccer America’s Preseason All-America Team, and was tabbed by ESPN as a top contender for the Hermann Trophy.Akpan came back to campus looking particularly sharp following a summer in which he played for the Chicago Fire’s Premier Development League squad. “Andre put a lot of work in this summer playing at a really high level, and it’s carried over and he’s gotten off to a hot start,” Grimm said. “He’s working well with the other people he has playing around him and it’s resulted in a lot of success for him and the team.” Grimm and the rest of the squad are now hoping that Akpan’s fast start will continue. Of course, they will be expecting nothing less, given all of the co-captain’s accomplishments over the past three years. “It’s an honor to have been able to have done what I’ve done so far, and I hope to keep it going,” Akpan said. Akpan next takes the field Friday as the Crimson faces Boston University at 4 p.m. on Ohiri Field.—Staff writer Jay M. Cohen can be reached at jaycohen@fas.harvard.edu.

With a solid back line and a three-time All-Ivy keeper between the pipes, the Crimson has enough to overcome an offense still beginning to take shape. As it turns out, all the Harvard women’s soccer team needed for its first win of 2009 was a single goal—and what a score it was.Second on the team in points and goals a year ago, junior Katherine Sheeleigh found the net for the first time this season, propelling the Crimson (1-1-1) to a 1-0 victory over New Hampshire (1-3-0) yesterday afternoon at Ohiri Field.“It feels really good for us,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said. “We’ve been wanting it for a while. It just feels good to get that now, and build off of that, and get a taste of what it feels like so we can keep striving for more.”The game’s key moment came barely three minutes into the match, when junior co-captain Gina Wideroff sent a lob in from 20 yards out. Sheeleigh headed the lofty ball straight at Wildcat goalie Ally Yost, who handled the shot but couldn’t manage to corral the rebound. The Harvard forward’s second attempt rocketed off her right foot and into the cage.“Pretty wild goal, I know,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “A great little half chance by Sheeleigh, and I’m glad she took it. A great player will score crazy goals like that sometimes.”Figuring out the kinks in its offense, Harvard emphasized staying aggressive following the early score, and finished with 11 shots in the half.“We played well at times,” Leone said. “It’s still early season form for us, and I know anybody watching can tell that. It’s coming, just slower than we all want.”Though the Crimson continues to refine its touch on lengthier passes, a constantly pressing attack forced Yost into a couple more saves on attempts off the feet of Wideroff and Sheeleigh. The New Hampshire netminder had eight saves on the day, matching her career high.For its part, the defense maintained a constant presence. The contributions of sophomore Lindsey Kowal and freshman Taryn Kurcz, who got the start along with backline mainstays Nichols and junior Katie Kuzma, who is also a Crimson sports editor, helped prevent the Wildcats from making much headway onto the Crimson’s side of the pitch during the initial 45 minutes.Of the six first-period shots Harvard allowed, none presented serious threats.“The best defense for us, especially in this game, was trying to stay relentless, not letting down offensively,” Nichols said. “I don’t think we played at the same level that we started the game with throughout the game, but we never stopped trying to go to goal, and that’s why we played so well defensively, because we tried to lock them in on our end.”As New Hampshire pushed to even the tally before the half, a final-minute 30-yard try flew over the crossbar. Senior goalie Lauren Mann grabbed a deflected ball on the next possession and held on until the clock ran out.The Crimson’s dominating play continued through the second stanza, especially in the opening minutes, when blasts by Wideroff and sophomore Melanie Baskind nearly extended the Harvard advantage.The Wildcats’ search for the tying goal would not lead to any scoring threats, and Mann’s only save of the game came on a 30-yarder late in the 83rd minute.The Crimson doubled up its opponents in shots, 26-13, for the contest. The mismatch was particularly notable on corner kicks, as Harvard had seven to New Hampshire’s one.The Crimson still has a long way to go, however.“We haven’t really established ourself yet and the style of play that’s going to define our team,” Nichols said. “It takes a lot to become a team. I felt like last season, it took the entire season to get to that really great feeling…I think we started this season better than we have in the past, so I have a lot of confidence that we’re going to do well pretty early.”—Staff writer Dennis J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the saying goes, every dog has its day.Yesterday belonged to the University of Connecticut Huskies at the Malkin Athletic Center, but by a slim margin.Following numerous lead changes, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (2-2) dropped its contest against UConn (3-5), 3-2.The day was not decided until the fifth set, which saw the Crimson jump out to an early lead. Husky blocking and a Harvard net violation put UConn on top, 5-3. Suffering from several service errors, the Huskies then stumbled into an 8-7 deficit. Sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll took advantage of the Husky lull and provided a crucial block for the Crimson, prompting the announcer to shout, “AC Ingersoll says no!”  Objecting in its own way, UConn initiated a 4-0 run to bring the win within reach. Ingersoll responded with two straight kills before two errors created a match point for the Huskies—a situation from which UConn emerged victorious, 15-13.“We’ve never played [UConn] that close before,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said.The contest featured a constant jostle for the lead that began in the first set.The teams opened the match by trading points until the Crimson found itself on top, 7-5, thanks to a monster kill from Ingersoll, who hit for .485 and 14 kills throughout the match.“You see that the glue really is [senior Lily Durwood], [co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn] and [senior Katherine Kocurek], even though she’s in and out,” Weiss said. “They really hold together the team. And so then Anne Carroll Ingersoll is seeing the block well, she’s working hard. And I’m excited for what’s ahead.”The two teams continued to trade haymakers throughout the first frame, keeping the score tight through the early stages of the contest. A drop shot gave Harvard a 10-9 lead, but the Huskies regained a 14-12 advantage using well-placed kills. Neither team could build an effective streak, however, and the Crimson climbed back to tie it at 14-14.At 14-16, Kocurek’s efforts to recover a near-lost point translated into a devastating kill from sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer. However, Harvard could not capitalize on the momentum from Kocurek’s play, dropping the next five points and, eventually, the set.A similar, back-and-forth trend characterized the second set, as neither team gained a significant lead throughout the match. A drop shot from freshman Taylor Docter started a 3-0 Crimson run—which included an ace from Docter—and caused an UConn timeout with the score at 22-19. The Huskies responded with offensive efforts of their own and nearly forced overtime, but Ono Horn closed out the match at 25-23 with a well-placed kill.Ono Horn contributed several key defensive plays as well, racking up 23 blocks throughout the match. Sophomore libero Christine Wu tacked on another 27 and made strategic plays for the Crimson, frequently saving the point with a gymnast-like style. The pace picked up at the start of the third, with both teams exchanging big kills. Ingersoll led an offensive barrage that put Harvard up 15-12. The Huskies’ deficit grew to five due in part to Durwood’s efficient serving. Though the Crimson committed several errors and allowed UConn to creep up at 21-17, a kill from junior Mikaelle Comrie earned Harvard the following possession and an eventual six-point lead. Throughout the third, the home team dominated on offense, hitting for .556, and won the set in decisive fashion,  25-17.Harvard carried momentum from the third set into the fourth, opening the frame with a 3-0 run. UConn matched Harvard’s offensive efforts, and the fight for the lead commenced yet again. The two teams tied nine times during the fourth.Jostling for the lead, Harvard received a boost from its rookies, especially Docter, who tallied another two aces, and freshman Ann Carroll. Carroll notched two of her seven kills in the fourth.“[Caroll] did amazing today,” Ono Horn said. “Every time we have someone new come on the court, they really add to the game.”—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

In 1945, Harvard let the country know about their first General Education curriculum with a hardcover red book that they mailed to schools, libraries, and universities across the country. In 2009, they are marketing the curriculum to Harvard's student body a little differently--with course trailers.
Inspired by the course trailer that East Asian Studies professor Shigehisa Kuriyama created for his class Culture and Belief 11: "Medicine and the Body in East Asia and Europe" over a year ago, Gen Ed administrators have encouraged professors to create videos to make their Gen Ed classes look new (even if they aren't). Gen Ed administrators Jay Harris and Stephanie Kenen could not be reached for comment.
Nine professors so far have pulled this off with varying levels of success. Notably, none of these eight course trailers are in the sciences. Anyway, a few of these course trailers are actually sort of cool, so FlyBy has ranked them.  Our Top Three list is after the jump.3) Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 17: "Soundscapes: Exploring Music in a Changing World"
This former Core class' course trailer has lots of beautiful world music. And a live bagpipe player.
2) Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 14: "Putting Modernism Together"
With snatches of music ranging from The Jetsons' theme song to Mahler-like brass, English professor Daniel Albright's former Core class' course trailer is pretty cool. The best part, however, may be the philosophical undertones:
1) Societies of the World 19: "Western Ascendancy: The Mainsprings of Global Power from 1600 to the Present"
This excerpt from Niall Ferguson's recent PBS documentary series, "The War of the World," without a doubt snatches the Number 1 spot. The other professors are not half as photogenic, nor do their trailers have half as many explosions (which is really the important part for FlyBy).

You may have noticed people from the venerable soft drink brand Dr. Pepper out in the Square this weekend giving away free cans of their new cherry Dr. Pepper and Diet Dr. Pepper drinks. FlyBy chatted them up before they took off Monday, and they said they'd be back near the corner of Dunster St. and Mass. Ave. on Wednesday starting at 11 a.m. No word on whether they'll be back later in the week, though, so clear your schedule. Free drinks > that course you're shopping.

Admit it. The first time you got accosted by a swarm of fifty tourists in the yard, you felt like a rock star.
And then it started to get creepy—you realized that the tourists weren’t just interested in petting John Harvard’s distinguished extremity—they wanted a picture of you, an authentic Harvard student.
Can’t get enough of that unpleasant, mildly tingly sensation?
Thanks to Harvard College Interactive Media Group (HCIMG), you can now play yourself in digital form: You, a courageous Harvard student who looks a little like Mario circa 1985, must dodge zillions of identical (suspiciously Asian looking) tourists as you scramble to gather school supplies and deliver them to Annenberg before you get caught in the crossfire of three camera flashes (and then die). The game is called Yard Quest. It’s as awesome as it sounds. More after the jump.The old school graphics and sound effects are kind of cute, and Flyby was sad when we beat the only level in about 10 minutes. If the brilliant creators Adam Gold '11 and Frances Yun ’10 feel so inclined (and read this), we have some suggestions for levels two through four: (2) Dodge disaffected youths with blue dreadlocks in The Square (3) Bathe muggers in Cambridge Commons with pepper spray (4) Avoid previous hook-ups while doing an especially conspicuous (smeared eye-liner) walk of shame back to the Yard.
Beat the game? Watch overly zealous tourists take a picture of a squirrel.

You know that scene in Matilda where Miss Trunchbull forces the poor fat boy to ingest an entire chocolate cake in front of his aghast peers? It's the most awful thing to watch, but for some reason, you can't seem to rip your eyes away, investing yourself in the horror of the scene until you seem to feel the goop greasing the sides of your own esophagus.
FlyBy thinks that might be how it would feel if it watched the play WATERBOARD, an Institute for Intermediate Studies production. Club Oberon in Harvard Square will open the play on Sunday at 8 PM.
The play "aims to create awareness and discussion about waterboarding as a form of torture." How, you may ask? Well, performers Nadeem Mazen and Stephanie M. Skier '05 will be waterboarding each other for approximately three minutes of the show. Find out more after the jump.
"Waterboarding seemed to be the term in circulation, and I think it's something that many people do not understand in terms of what it physically looks like," says Skier, the play's director and writer who sought training from someone who had gone through Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE), a U.S. program that trains troops to withstand torture.
"Part of the project of creating a visual image of waterboarding in the space of the theater, which is very much a visual space, is to highlight the present absence of documentary visual evidence of waterboarding," Skier adds in an interview with FlyBy.
The show, which seeks to explore the history of drowning torture, will encourage interaction with the audience and employ animation to demonstrate more dangerous forms of waterboarding ("We're not going to do those on stage because we don't want to die," Skier notes). To explore "the eerily whimsical linguistic connotations" of the term "waterboarding," Mazen and Skier will also "play on slip’n’slides and toss beach balls while singing about 'enhanced interrogation techniques,'" according to the event's Facebook page.
"What does it mean to bear witness to something that we had not seen ourselves and don't have access to evidence of? " Skier says. "We are functioning as witnesses but at the same time acknowledging that we are incapable of doing that in any real way."
