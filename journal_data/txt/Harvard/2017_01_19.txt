After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was in 8th grade, I spent an hour every Wednesday packed in a poorly lit room with the rest of my gym class, giggling uncomfortably as our health teacher lectured us on STDs, drugs, and proper birth control. Our teacher—a funny, sarcastic man who managed to put even hormonal tweenagers at relative ease hearing the word “vagina”—would go through the anonymous “Question Box” where we had submitted a combination of goofy and serious questions. We would then talk openly about relationships, sexuality, and substance usage. I am grateful for those Wednesdays, but I realize now that our curriculum was missing a key lesson plan.
In that classroom, I thought the main health problems adults faced were from the devastating effects of external factors—unprotected sex, tequila, cocaine. But when I entered high school, I quickly realized that no one had ever taught me how to handle a whole different set of crises. Throughout the years, friends would come crying to me in classes or over the phone, self-diagnosing themselves with depression or anxiety disorder while refusing to seek professional help.
No one had ever taught us the clinical definition of mental illness. No one had ever taught us what was happening inside our own minds. No one had ever taught us what treatments were available. And so we muddled through, taking turns serving as each other’s unqualified therapist. We Googled symptoms online, learning about mental disorders only once they had already taken root in our lives. We failed to understand that they can and deserve to be treated.
My experience in high school was not unusual. One in five children suffers from a mental illness, and almost every student knows a friend who has struggled with mental illness. It is not surprising, then, that studies find treatment rates for young adults are disturbingly low. Just 44.7 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds receive treatment for their depression, even though half of all chronic mental illnesses begin by age 14. The average delay between the onset of mental illness and the start of treatment is a staggering ten years.
Given its pervasive impact on young adults, mental health has become an increasingly popular topic in campus debates and newspaper op-eds. Harvard and America as a whole are scrambling to address this public health crisis—and they are fighting an uphill battle.
Students are entering adulthood without ever receiving a basic, scientific education on mental illness. Harvard and other universities end up having to play catch-up, providing students with the resources and education that they should’ve been receiving all along. Although schools regularly devote precious classroom hours and funds to alcohol, drug, and sexual education—and rightly so—mental health programming is often relegated to brief, one-time presentations.
There has been a recent movement for schools to support students already diagnosed with mental health issues. While this approach is a necessary part of the solution, it is not nearly sufficient. Imagine if, rather than providing alcohol education in classrooms, administrations decided to only support students already diagnosed with alcoholism. There would be a public outcry. Yet when it comes to mental health issues, our approach is precisely that. We are reactive, not proactive, and students are suffering the consequences. Early intervention can greatly benefit young adults. Yet they often delay seeking help because they’ve never been taught that it is available or that they might need it in the first place.
A new curriculum does not have to be groundbreaking. For many students, even learning the definition of “anxiety disorder” would be a drastic improvement. Just as students are told to exercise regularly and wear sunscreen, they also ought to gain a basic understanding of how to protect their mental health. Additionally, students should learn about some of the most common conditions they might suffer from and potential treatment options. Then if they suffer a mental health crisis down the road, they will already have a list of resources handy.
This education would also help remove the dangerous stigma that surrounds mental illness. It would normalize the subject and provide students with a better-educated and more empathetic support system. After all, we teach students how their bodies work in health class—Isn’t it time we teach them how their brains work as well?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The train moved towards the convention center in Cleveland, Ohio on July 18, 2016 as we sat with our matching orange shirts, posters, and megaphones in hand. Aware of our surroundings, we spoke in Spanish and had people translate quietly to the members who didn’t understand. The siren sound accidentally went off on one of our organizer’s megaphones and she hurried to shut it off. But it was too late—An older woman quickly turned to scold her.
“That was incredibly rude,” the older woman bemoaned.
“I’m sorry. It was an accident,” the organizer said.
“Well don’t do it again,” the woman commanded.
This woman’s face was filled with so much unwarranted hatred at something so trivial. I searched for some explanation for her behavior and found it in the T-shirt she was wearing as well as the straw hat of the man she sat next to: “TRUMP 2016.” It made sense then. Her vision was flawed. While I saw a group of young, strong, fearless activists, she saw a group of people who were beneath her who didn’t deserve her respect. I looked down at the poster I held between my knees: “United Against Hate.”
Two men in their twenties saw our posters as well and approached our group. They carried cameras. When they asked to interview us, we looked at each other to try and come to a consensus on what our next move would be. We asked them why they wanted to interview us, and they explained that they were filming a documentary to give Europeans a better look into our American presidential election. They introduced themselves and gave their nationalities.
The older woman’s face lit up at the news that one of them was Italian. She got his attention by speaking to him in his native language like they were old friends. This was a completely different person from the one we had been exposed to five minutes prior. The reporter decided to talk to this woman, and the man who I assumed was her husband. The other reporter stayed and talked to our group.
As we spoke to him, I couldn’t help but listen to the conversation going on behind me. The woman went on and on talking about Trump as if he was her Messiah. She spoke as if her own ancestors would not have been the ones being persecuted in this very train just a few generations ago the same way her idol was persecuting my people. She didn’t understand the marginalization that millions of people continue to feel today, but she did understand that not everybody shared her opinion on the presidential candidate.
“I know some people don’t like him. I didn’t like Bush or Obama, but I still had to live through their presidencies. They just need to get over it,” she said.
I looked down at my forearm as she delivered this shameless rhetoric. Numbers ran across my skin in black sharpie: emergency contacts we had written down, in case something happened to us as we exercised our freedom to protest the presumptive nominee.
I was reminded of why I was there that day. I was reminded of the hours we had spent preparing to make sure that we were safe while protesting. I was reminded of Ohio’s open carry law and Trump supporters’ prevailing infatuation with guns.  I was reminded of the people who had been harassed and looked down on by Trump supporters. I was reminded of the lies the presidential candidate had spread about my undocumented community.
That was the thing this woman did not understand. We might just not be able to live through such a presidency.
“Get over it.”
Her words echoed through my mind on November 9, 2016. They repeated over and over again like a broken record as I spent three hours crying uncontrollably in my bed. They repeated as I thought what my future would mean under a president who wanted to take away my DACA and deport me. They repeated as I thought of what would happen to my family, my friends, and my community.
“Get over it.”
This sentiment continues to flood my newsfeed as I read comments left by Trump supporters complaining about the way Democrats were handling this loss like children. It continues as people like Mitch McConnell tell us to “grow up,” claiming that Democrats are only upset because their party lost. They claim we are just sore losers. This sentiment continues to play out as the government prepares for this presidency — one that could mean the end to life as we know it in America. What they don’t seem to understand is that it’s not about being upset for losing an election. It’s about losing our safety and peace of mind. It’s about our lives and our futures.
“Get over it.”
I refuse to listen. I am trying to get through this. We can’t just pretend that millions of people’s lives aren’t at risk. We can’t just sit by idly and watch the country that people have worked so hard to build up burn to the ground. I will protest and I will demand justice. You can choose to join me in the fight or not. But don’t you dare tell me to get over it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My to-do list is pretty standard Harvard fare, filled with your typical Harvard stressors: academics, extracurriculars, internships, and relationships (perhaps the latter is a distant fourth). Toss in constant elevated levels of pre-med stress and garnish it with just a bit of pressure to not let my aggressive tiger mother down, and there you have it: my edition of Harvard’s stress platter. Talk about fine dining.
At a cursory glance, stress seems like the villain of this campus. Students and administrators alike have chosen this conclusion and responded to it with intense criticisms. A combination of troubling research findings about the increasing prevalence of anxiety and depression, heartfelt personal narratives about Harvard’s inadequate mental health support, and increased student activism has led Harvard, as well as other universities, to hone in on our culture of stress as a pathology that hurts students.
Harvard has told advisors and mental health services providers to encourage students to drop extracurriculars and other commitments to try to lower their stress, and even to take time off — anything to try to alleviate the stress that students have put themselves under. Harvard has also formed a stress workgroup to make recommendations for ways to “make undergraduate life less stressful.” Students themselves have also led initiatives to target and try to mitigate stress, from the development of a serenity room in the Yard to students offering free back rubs at Lamont to peers to recent Undergraduate Council campaigns making mental health reform a central tenet of their platforms.
These initiatives all lash out at stress as something that has purely negative effects. However, to push the idea that stress is bad and that students should always be working to reduce it is wrong.
We spend so much time tearing down stress that we forget that it can have value. Stress isn’t always the negative, stomach-churning anxiety induced by procrastination. Science shows that moderate stress can actually be beneficial for cognitive function. The idea that moderate stress may have a positive effect has been demonstrated in both rats and humans. In fact, moderate stress may actually make the brain more “resilient” to damage. Since many Harvard students tend to be stressed, Type A “overachievers,” it’s no secret that stress can help us achieve, whether that achievement manifests as  higher starting salaries right after graduation or a significant number of Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes.
And most of us can’t deny the role of stress in getting us to Harvard in the first place. I certainly recall a fair share of Friday and Saturday nights when I had to study for an upcoming standardized exam instead of going out with friends, or practice violin in preparation for submitting an arts supplement after I finished my homework at 3 a.m. —all instead of sleeping at a reasonable time.
So much due diligence went into preparing for an increasingly selective application process. Staying on top of grades, standardized tests, and many other facets of resume-building is not an easy feat for any teenager. But with the help of just the right amount of stress, the little voice in my head telling me “work harder, you can do it” ultimately yielded what I thought was the biggest reward of all: acceptance to Harvard. Stress is not just a wrongdoer; it can be a motivator. So the recent movement to label stress as something toxic and dangerous may be an equally dangerous mistake.
Blacklisting stress has caused us to avoid rather than confront it. This all-or-nothing approach to stress is unsafe and unsustainable. Rather than brush stress off as something that solely has adverse effects on students and advocate every measure possible to reduce stress, universities should encourage students to learn how to take greater control of it. Especially given the overachieving nature of Harvard students, simply trying to shift the culture to a less stressful one both trivializes our hardworking spirit as well as what mental illness actually entails.
We all walk a precarious line between productivity and breakdown. Unfortunately, it seems like all we’re paying attention to is the breakdown. Perhaps it is human nature to fixate on the tragedy in every situation, but to ignore the bright side is to invite a slippery slope linking even the slightest of stressors to the possibility of a mental health problem. Fixating on the breakdown and placing such a strong negative stigma on stress is dangerous for all students. Anxiety is a disease. Stress is not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Octavia Spencer, an Oscar-winning actress and children’s book author, will be the the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2017 Woman of the Year.
Spencer is widely known for her roles in “The Help,” the “Divergent” film series, and most recently as one of the lead characters in the film “Hidden Figures,” which follows the story of three black women who aid NASA in launching the program’s early space missions. She has won numerous awards for her work, including an Academy Award, Golden Globe, Broadcast Film Critic’s Choice Award and BAFTA Award.
The Hasty Pudding will honor Spencer with a parade through the streets of Cambridge Jan. 26 before presenting her with the traditional “Pudding Pot” in Farkas Hall. The event will be live-streamed on Facebook.
"We could not be more excited to offer Ms. Spencer our Woman of the Year award,”  Adam L. Chiavacci ’18, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals' Co-producer, said in a press release. “We are humbled by her talent and are so honored that our little Pudding pot will be sitting alongside Ms Spencer's Oscar and Golden Globe on her mantle.”
The Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year award, established in 1951, has been awarded to actresses including Meryl Streep, Amy Poehler, Kerry Washington, and Helen Mirren in recent years.
Apart from acting, Spencer has also authored a children’s mystery book series and directed a short film. She will appear in “The Shape of Water,” an upcoming fantasy film directed by Guillermo del Toro.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals announced earlier this month that Ryan Reynolds will be the theatrical company’s 2017 Man of the Year.

Harvard disputed union organizers’ concerns about a November student unionization vote in a filing with the National Labor Relations Board Tuesday, arguing that the University provided accurate lists of eligible voters in the election.
Last month, student union organizers argued in an objection filed with the NLRB that voter lists provided by the University for the election may have prevented eligible students from participating. The result of that vote—which remains too close to call—could decide whether the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers will represent undergraduate teaching assistants and graduate student research and teaching assistants in collective bargaining negotiations.
The union effort organizers charge that the November election, which currently indicates that more students oppose unionization than support it, should be invalidated and are calling for a re-vote. The NLRB will decide whether to consider the union effort’s objections and the University’s response prior to Feb. 21, according to NLRB deputy regional attorney Robert P. Redbord.
In its motion to dismiss the union’s objection, the University asserted that it had generated a list of eligible voters—known as an Excelsior list—that was accurate. Harvard not only provided a list of the students who were on the University’s centralized payroll, but also searched for eligible non-payroll students, the filing argues.
“There was and is no way for Harvard to have generated a materially better or more ‘accurate’ Excelsior list than the list that was created for this election,” the University’s response reads. “Harvard engaged in every good faith effort to produce an Excelsior list that identified all students employed in teaching and research positions.”
The University also argued that union organizers did not file “substantial” objections to the voter list until after the election and charged there was no evidence that the voter lists had affected the election’s outcome.
The University’s filing is the latest development in a months-long election process characterized by disputes about voter eligibility. During the election, more than 1,200 ballots were challenged; more than 300 of these ballots are still under challenge, leaving the election results up in the air. The NLRB will hold a hearing on Feb. 21 to decide which of the challenged ballots should be counted.
Union organizer Abhinav Reddy disputed the University’s claim that HGSU-UAW had not notified the University of alleged problems with the voter list prior to the election.
“The HGSU-UAW has notified the administration several times of multiple inaccuracies within the voter list and it’s ultimately the responsibility of the administration to provide accurate lists, being the employer here,” he said.
Reddy also disagreed with Harvard’s argument that the voter list had no impact on the election. He pointed to the addition of challenged ballots to the eligible voter lists as a reason the University’s initial list was incomplete.
“We’ve seen that the administration’s lists were incomplete and we’re missing hundreds—I want to stress this—hundreds of eligible voters,” he said. “Even during the NLRB post-election challenge process, the administration acknowledged that hundreds of challenged ballots...should have been counted because they were eligible individuals.”
Reddy declined to comment on whether the unionization effort would file a response to Harvard’s most recent document.
If NLRB decides to move forward with the union effort’s objections, it would consolidate discussions on the objection with the Feb. 21 hearing on challenged ballots, according to Redbord.  The University has also filed its own, separate objection about a single ballot that could be considered at the same hearing.

Harvard Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. advocated for criminal justice reform and an end to mass incarceration in a TEDx talk entitled “Justice is a decision,” arguing that wrongful convictions are widespread and often overlooked.
Sullivan, who is also a Winthrop House Faculty Dean and former adviser to President Barack Obama, began the talk with stories from his personal experiences exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals in Brooklyn, N.Y.  In some cases, wrongfully convicted individuals spent years in prison or died before their release, Sullivan said.
In an interview Tuesday, Sullivan noted that although he considers the United States’s criminal justice system “the greatest legal system in the world, there still are very many people who fall through the cracks.”
“We should aspire to have a criminal justice system where each and every person has full protection and equal protection under the law and until we get there, we as a citizenry should not rest,” he said.
Sullivan suggested changing the conservative mantra of being “tough on crime” to instead being “smart on crime” in order to remedy the understanding of race in the system.
“If we behave that way, then we will begin to weed out some of the subjective biases that adhere in the criminal justice system and all citizens will begin to be treated with equal protection under the law,” Sullivan said in the interview.
Sullivan also said that President-elect Donald Trump’s rhetoric on criminal justice has mirrored “‘tough on crime’ vocabulary.” Trump has vowed to bring “law and order” back to “crime infested” cities, and has given law enforcement officials his “complete and total support.”
“Time will tell what sort of policies he will enact,” Sullivan said. “My inclination is to reserve judgement and see how his administration handles the pressing issues of criminal justice reform.”
Nate Mook, an organizer of the Washington, D.C. TEDx conference at which Sullivan spoke in October, said he created the theme of “New Rules” with the intention of addressing what citizens should improve in the next decade.
“When we looked at our theme for 2016, we felt like the world was a little bit upside down,” Mook said.  “The future required us to start thinking about these ‘New Rules’ that could guide us in the next century.”
Apart from his work in criminal law and race theory at the Law School, Sullivan previously directed the D.C. Public Defender Service and worked to release thousands of inmates in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. He also represented the family of Michael Brown, a black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo in 2014.
“If there’s anything that we’ve learned—anything that I’ve learned—with this conviction integrity work, it’s that justice doesn’t just happen. People make justice happen,” Sullivan said at the TEDx conference. “Justice is not a thing that just descends from above and makes everything right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard government lecturer and Dunster House resident dean Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo has accepted a position in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration and will not teach at the College this semester.
Diaz Rosillo, who taught the popular class Government 1359: “The Road to the White House” in the fall, will serve as the “Director of Policy and Interagency Coordination” in the “Office of the Senior Advisor to the President for Policy,” according to an announcement released by Trump’s transition team in early January.
“I’m excited and I’m honored that I’ve been asked to join the administration,” Diaz Rosillo said. “I’ve been studying, reading, teaching, and writing about the American presidency, so it’s a great opportunity to apply what I’ve been doing for decades.”
In his new role, Diaz Rosillo said he will focus on policy execution, ensuring the new administration’s policies are implemented “the way they’re supposed to be implemented.” For now, he will concentrate mainly on domestic and economic policy, he said.
“Diaz-Rosillo [sic] brings a wealth of experience on presidential power, administrative action, executive leadership and the policymaking and executive action process to this key role,” the transition team’s announcement reads.
Diaz Rosillo served on Trump’s transition team, aiding the President-elect as an “Executive Authority Adviser,” though his students in Government 1359 said his political leanings were not apparent during the course.
Diaz Rosillo said his colleagues in the Government department have been “very supportive and very gracious” about his decision to work for Trump. He said he wished more Harvard faculty would consider taking positions in the new administration.
“I think if you care deeply about your country, you have an obligation to use your talents to help make government better,” he said. “I respect it if you don’t want to serve, that’s your choice and I completely respect it.”
“I think I have an obligation to help the administration be the best it can be,” he added.
Diaz Rosillo is formally resigning his position at Harvard to focus on his new job, and will move to Washington, D.C. in coming weeks. He said he is unsure whether he will return to the College in the long run, and added he will “absolutely” miss teaching.
“The Government department is very sorry to see him leave Harvard, and to lose his excellent course on the presidency,” Government professor and department chair Jennifer L. Hochschild wrote in an emailed statement .
Looking to the future, Diaz Rosillo said he thinks his biggest challenge will be adapting to a “brand new environment,” though he said he considers both Harvard and the White House “awesome.”
While Harvard professors have frequently worked with presidents and presidential candidates in the past, few have so far joined Trump’s team. After Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on Nov. 9, students and professors alike expressed shock and concern over the election results.
Other Harvard affiliates named to positions in Trump’s administration include School of Public Health graduate Katy F. Talento, who will work in healthcare policy, and Zina G. Bash ’04, a College and Law School alumnus who will focus on regulatory reform and legal and immigration policy. Jared C. Kushner ’03, Trump’s son-in-law, was recently named a senior White House adviser.

Researchers across Harvard received a record-high $842.5 million in grants in fiscal year 2016—but some say they are bracing for federal funding cuts under the Trump administration and seeking alternative sources of research support.
While federal funding continued to make up a majority of awards overall, non-federal awards—from sources like foundations and corporations—increased by 14 percent in the past fiscal year, compared to a 3 percent increase in federal funding. And while government-sponsored grants did increase from the previous fiscal year, they again did not reach the levels seen from 2012 to 2014, according to a report released by Harvard’s Office for Sponsored Programs last month.
According to Vice Provost for Research Richard McCullough, the University has worked to combat the trend of decreasing federal funding by raising money through private partnerships.
“This year we came back up, which was a good sign,” he said. “But it’s still a huge challenge.”
The amount committed by sponsors for future awards was down 3.3 percent in fiscal year 2016, which could indicate a “decreasing future funding stream,” according to the report. The decrease was due almost entirely to declining federal grants.
The decline in federal funding began with sequestration, the wide-ranging budget cuts enacted by the government in March 2013, according to McCullough. University President Drew G. Faust has publicly argued against sequestration, which aims to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget over ten years.
Beyond the impact of sequestration, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said federal funding levels may further decrease as President-elect Donald Trump transitions to power.
“It’s natural to have a concern about federal funding of research whenever there’s a change of administration. And so that’s a concern that we continue to have,”  Garber said in an interview last month. “In recent years we have been very much dedicated to broadening our sources of research support.”
Among non-federal funding sources, foundations supplied $146.8 million to Harvard researchers, an 18 percent increase from 2015, while corporations gave $50.2 million, a slight decrease from 2015.
Since Trump’s election in November, science professors and researchers at Harvard have expressed concerns that his administration will cut federal funding to programs, especially those focused on climate change. Daniel E. Lieberman, who chairs Harvard’s Human Evolutionary Biology department, said that while his department is preparing for a “worst case scenario,” science research has been moving towards private funding for years.
“When Congress many years ago cut off funding for stem cell research, we basically had to go private. And I think that might serve as a model for a lot of research,” he said. “We’re going to think about having to do that if we want to remain a premier research institution.”
While McCullough also said that federal funding levels could fluctuate, he said he believes there is bipartisan support for basic research.
In the event of decreased federal funding, partnerships with corporations are one alternate source of revenue. McCullough said that corporate sponsorships are “very standard among universities,” and that the corporations have no claim on the intellectual property produced by researchers.
“We have a number of policies that are  intended to preserve academic freedom by putting constraints on requirements that corporations might wish to impose on that research,” Garber said. “And we’ve had very very good experiences with corporate research agreements.”
Lieberman, however, said that he is wary of corporate sponsorships because they can “raise questions” about conflicts of interest.
In fiscal year 2016, the majority of Harvard’s research grants continued to come from public institutions. The National Institutes of Health, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, was the University’s largest federal funding source, supplying Harvard researchers $415 million. The National Science Foundation contributed the second highest level of federal funding, providing $54.9 million. Both agencies increased their funding levels from the previous year.
The Department of Defense also provided $53.7 million, contributing 9 percent of Harvard's total federal funding.
“Federal funding has played and will continue to play an essential role,” Garber said.
In terms of academic fields, $407 million, 48 percent of total sponsored expenditures, went to the life sciences, while $3 million—less than 1 percent—was allocated to the humanities, according to the report.

George Q. Daley ’82, the new dean of Harvard Medical School, introduced a task force intended to make the school more diverse and expressed concern about the “uncertainty” of federal research funding at a town hall event Tuesday.
In light of recent calls to increase diversity at Medical School and the creation of an University-wide task force on diversity, Daley—who became dean of the school earlier this month—announced that the Medical School will create a similar school-specific task force. Dean of Diversity at the Medical School Joan Y. Reede will assemble the task force, which will seek a “stronger and deeper evaluation of the issues we are confronting,” Daley said.
Last February, a group of roughly 40 Medical Students delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall urging University President Drew G. Faust to interview candidates from underrepresented minorities in medicine and choose a Medical School dean who would commit to increasing campus diversity. Medical School activists also drafted a “social justice agenda” for the new dean last year, requesting more student involvement in faculty search committees, among other initiatives.
“The point is that I need to be hearing directly from you in order to better understand you, to listen to your needs and aspirations,” Daley said at the meeting, which drew more than 100 people to the Joseph B. Martin conference center in Boston.
At the meeting, Daley also said that transitions of power in the government and “mounting concerns” over diminishing federal research funding may adversely affect the Medical School. As a result, Daley said, seeking out private sources of research funding would be a priority of his tenure.
“Our best way to counteract these negative trends are the quality of our faculty and our students and the impact of our scientists,” Daley said. “What better way than to attract investment than to focus on our continuing scientific excellence?”
Daley also said that unlike other medical institutions, the Medical School lacks a center for social interaction. He pledged to host more informal social events at Gordon Hall.
“Social gatherings directly translate into intellectual, scientific, and entrepreneurial opportunities,“ Daley said. “I want to revive the tradition of bringing people together under casual circumstances to incubate great ideas.”
Additionally, Daley said he wants to extend intellectual collaboration beyond the Medical School by planning a series of events which would bring scientists and practitioners with common goals and interests together.
Daley, who was named dean in August, joined the Medical School faculty in 1995.  At the meeting, Daley, who also attended the school, said that he was “deeply entrenched here at HMS” and “fiercely loyal to the institution.”
“It’s my hope that I can infect all of you with my sense of pride for this place,” Daley said to the audience. He emphasized the need for “transparent” and “candid” communication in the process in which others can feel “comfortable to criticize and speak out against problems.”
Harvard Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Director M. William “Willy” Lensch will serve as the Medical School’s Chief of Staff.
Several audience members said they were impressed by Daley’s presentation.
“I think Dean Daley gave a very clear account on what he will do and I think he means what he said,” Jeantine E. Lunshof, a visiting fellow in genetics at the Medical School, said. “This is what the school needs at the moment.”
Alexander Miamen, a graduate student at the Medical School, described Daley’s speech as “reassuring” and “inspiring.”
“Now, we are waiting to see implementation,” Miamen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will begin a process to replace Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides in the coming weeks, looking to fill a position that some Title IX experts say will be widely sought after.
Karvonides, the University’s first Title IX Officer, left Harvard on Jan. 17 for a position in the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, surprising some students. Bill D. McCants, the Deputy Title IX Officer at the time of Karvonides’s departure, is serving as Acting Title IX Officer until Harvard finds a permanent replacement.
Since Karvonides’s departure, the Title IX office has focused on managing the transition, according to Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga. The University’s first priority is ensuring the Title IX office can maintain normal operations throughout the search process, she said.
“It is critically important that we have staff in place to handle the caseload, that we do not lose the gains that we have made in investigating cases in a timely and thorough manner, and that we do not lose momentum on some of the important projects of the office,” deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement.
In its efforts to ease the transition, the University has hired a new Title IX fellow, who will join the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution on Jan. 30, and has “made temporary assignment adjustments” for staffers in the Title IX and ODR offices, deLuzuriaga wrote. The Office for Dispute Resolution is the central office that handles sexual harassment complaints from across the University.
Harvard will officially launch its search for Karvonides’s replacement some time in the next few weeks, according to deLuzuriaga. The Office for Dispute Resolution was initially understaffed, and Karvonides spearheaded a “pipeline program” to help bolster the office’s growth during her tenure.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said he did not think Harvard would have difficulty hiring a new Title IX Officer qualified for the position. He said he thinks the job is “particularly appealing” and will likely attract an “exceptional” applicant pool.
The appeal of the position stems from the many challenges Harvard’s Title IX Officer will face, Lake said, pointing to the ongoing federal probe of the College’s compliance with Title IX and recent scrutiny of Harvard’s athletics department as examples.
“To me, if you want to be the best Title IX coordinator in America, the Harvard challenges and opportunities will give you the chance to prove that you can be that person," Lake said. “It’s a signature opportunity.”
He added that anyone wary of dealing with these issues would not be the right person for the job.
Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, agreed with Lake. She said she thought the University would not have trouble finding many “good” candidates, though she noted Karvonides left “big shoes to fill.”
Both Bruno and Lake said they could see Harvard going with either an outside or an inside hire for the position. Bruno emphasized that both decisions would have merits and drawbacks.
“I think there’s a push and pull,” she said. “Of course you want the search done and the end to come quickly, but you don’t want it to be a rash decision, you don’t want to hire from the inside because it’s the easy thing to do.”
Bruno said she thought Harvard should look first and foremost for someone who will remain committed to Title IX enforcement independent of national political change. In the wake of Karvonides’s departure, some Harvard student activists said they thought federal enforcement of Title IX could weaken under President-elect Donald Trump, a lapse they worried might negatively affect victims of sexual assault at the University.
Reflecting on the situation, Lake reiterated that he thought the possibilities for Harvard’s next Title IX Officer were endless.
“Imagine somebody coming in and reconciling the Harvard Law faculty with the rest of the community, and crafting a policy that the finals clubs could let live, and working with the athletes,” he said. “You could be a real hero.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H. — The last time the Harvard men’s hockey team stepped foot inside Thompson Arena, the Crimson erupted for seven goals. But “only” seven.
In Tuesday night’s affair, Dartmouth proved it was not to be outdone. The Big Green could have won a batting title for its offensive efficiency against No. 6 Harvard, exploding for eight goals on just 24 shots to hand the stumbling Crimson yet another stunning defeat—this one by a final score of 8-4.
“We’re looking at ourselves; we need to be a lot better,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We were reckless with the puck and our decision-making, and it cost us. It’s frustrating [and] disappointing, but I don’t think we at any point played with the type of structure we need to have success.”
This latest snag comes on the heels of a disappointing weekend in New York for the Crimson (11-5-1, 7-4-1 ECAC), who has now lost three straight games and dropped from second to 12th in the PairWise rankings. This is the fifth consecutive year in which Harvard has dropped three or more games in the time between January 1 and the conclusion of winter break.
The Crimson was well on its way to righting the ship early on, as Harvard netted the game’s first two goals in a span of 2:05 midway through the first period—a welcoming sight for Donato considering the Crimson offense was held scoreless for a stretch totaling 119:50 over the weekend.
But Harvard’s largest lead of the night lasted all of 26 seconds. Almost immediately, Dartmouth’s Troy Crema converted on a 2-on-1 break to cut the gap in half, and in the periods that followed, the Big Green (7-8-3, 4-5-2) exposed a rickety unit that consistently left holes all over the ice.
“We were on the verge of taking over the game,” Donato said. “And we just really played with no concern for both sides of the puck.”
Dartmouth scored four times in the middle frame—twice to jump out to a 3-2 lead, then twice more to erase a 4-3 deficit and head into the second intermission with a one-goal edge. Then once sophomore defenseman Connor Yau tacked on goal number six at 3:08 in the third, Donato gave his goaltender the hook for the second time in three nights, swapping in freshman Cameron Gornet for junior Merrick Madsen, who stopped just 12 of 18 shots.
The Big Green’s backup netminder also entered the game on Tuesday following the Crimson’s fourth goal, a Tyler Moy power-play slapper midway through the second period. Freshman Adrian Clark took over for junior Devin Buffalo with his team trailing, 4-3, and his 14-for-14 performance in relief gave Dartmouth stability between the pipes while its offense took over. Backed by Clark, the Big Green scored three unanswered goals at even strength, then added two empty-netters in the final minute of play to push the final scoreline to 8-4.
When asked how his team needs to go about fixing the holes that were apparent on Tuesday night, Donato said it would take more than “X’s and O’s.”
“I think it’s an attitude thing,” Donato said. “I think we’ve lost a little bit of our focus on the process and are worried more about the results. And unfortunately the results we look like we’re playing for are goals and assists, not wins and losses.”
Donato’s son, Ryan, also echoed a need for change, calling the result “a tough pill to swallow.”
“Obviously there’s a lot of things we need to fix if we’re losing games like that, especially to teams we know we can beat,” Ryan Donato said. “I think we just need to work hard and stick to our systems, get back to what we know and how we can play, and eventually we’ll figure it out again.”
After hitting both a post and a crossbar, the sophomore center opened the scoring at 13:54 in the first, blowing by rookie defenseman Ben DiMaio in front of the Dartmouth bench and finishing off a breakaway in front of Buffalo. DiMaio’s misfortune didn’t end there, as co-captain Devin Tringale’s centering pass from behind the Big Green net just two minutes later bounced off the skate of freshman Will Graber, then ricocheted off DiMaio and into the goal.
But Crema’s 2-on-1 tally at 16:25 quickly pulled Dartmouth within one. The senior center flew up the right wing, and an outnumbered John Marino retreated a few steps too many, allowing Crema to creep into the slot and fire a shot past Madsen from point-blank range.
“I think one thing we’ve got to learn is once we score to not let up and not to cheat,” Ryan Donato said. “I think we got too comfortable after we [took] the lead, and we would take risks, and those risks came back to bite us.”
In the second period, Big Green center Kevan Kilistoff backhanded home a rebound on the power play to tie the game at 2:24. Exactly a minute later, three Harvard skaters drifted behind their net in hopes of winning a battle for a loose puck. They did not, and freshman Shane Sellar was the beneficiary all alone in the slot. His first career goal put Dartmouth ahead, 3-2.
The PA announcer quickly learned that his work was cut out for him in period two, as the goals just kept coming. Crimson sophomore Lewis-Zerter-Gossage logged his first tally since Nov. 26 from Buffalo’s left post at 5:23 to tie the game at three. Then Moy’s power-play goal from the left dot a little more than a minute later put Harvard back in front, 4-3.
Nonetheless, a turn-around blast from freshman Ryan Blankemeier and an odd-man rush finished off by associate captain Grant Opperman at 15:10 and 19:08, respectively, produced the game’s third and final lead change. Yau’s blast from the point plus the hosts’ two empty-netters represented all the goal-scoring in the last period of play.
GAME NOTES
—When asked if a goalie competition could potentially lie ahead, Donato said "we'll talk about it." In very limited action against RPI and now Dartmouth, freshman Cameron Gornet is a perfect 15-for-15 between the pipes.
—Both teams finished 1-for-2 on the power play.
—Harvard should have earned a third power-play opportunity after Dartmouth's Corey Kalk slashed the stick of co-captain Alexander Kerfoot with five seconds left in the second period. But Kerfoot dropped his broken stick following the slash, and the officials handed him an embellishment penalty as a result. Ted Donato and Kerfoot were both unsurprisingly furious, and the co-captain threw the stick onto the ice just before taking a seat in the penalty box, drawing boos from the Hanover crowd.
—Dartmouth captain Carl Hesler sat out due to injury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Wednesday marked the two-year anniversary of the last time that the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team lost.
On Jan. 11, 2015, then-No. 3 Penn dethroned the Crimson in a 5-4 affair. Since then, Harvard has rattled off 27 consecutive wins, claimed two national championships, and generally tormented the squash world.
Last weekend loomed as a threat to the Crimson’s reign, as the squad visited the No. 2 Quakers (3-1) and No. 4 Princeton (7-1). But the threat never materialized, as Harvard (4-0) dropped its first matches of the season but still dispatched Penn and the Tigers, 7-2 and 8-1, respectively.
NO. 1 HARVARD 8, NO. 4 PRINCETON 1
A well-fought squash contest takes nine matches to decide. Teams battle for every game, and the best-of-nine competition remains in doubt until all points have actually ended.
By contrast, the typical Crimson squash event lasts five matches—the minimum number to guarantee victory.
Against Princeton on Sunday, all five of Harvard’s top players won. In fact, none of these athletes dropped a set.
Sophomore Sophie Mehta also swept at No. 7, and senior Dileas MacGowan swept at No. 9. While junior Sue Ann Yong dropped a game, she rebounded for a serviceable 3-1 victory.
Freshman Eleonore Evans was the only Crimson player to suffer a defeat. The rookie responded to a first-frame loss with an 11-5 win, but she conceded both the final games by scores of 11-8.
The most dominant matches of the day belonged to sophomore Sabrina Sobhy and senior Katherine Tutrone. In clean sweeps, the two players lost a mere 12 points each.
The overpowering team victory meant that seven players continued an undefeated start to the season. This outcome was especially impressive given the Tigers’ performance heading into the match. Princeton, which entered Sunday with a perfect record, had conceded more than two matches only once—in a 6-3 win over Stanford to open the season.
NO. 1 HARVARD 7, NO. 2 PENN 2
It’s not often that Harvard women’s squash must stage a comeback. But on Saturday, after seven Crimson players lost their first game, the top team in the nation faced the unnerving task of overcoming early deficits.
The stakes were high, too. Ranked second in the country, the Quakers would likely claim the top spot with a victory. And the usurpers would gain the extra satisfaction of ending Harvard’s long winning streak—a run that began, after all, with a Quakers victory back in 2015.
But the Crimson prevented this possibility with crucial wins at lower positions. While Sobhy and freshman Gina Kennedy lost at the top two spots, all other Harvard players won to claim the 7-2 victory.
Four of the matches went the distance. Arguably the most epic was Kennedy’s loss to Penn junior Melissa Alves. After Alves took the first two games, Kennedy roared back with 11-1 and 11-9 wins to force a decisive fifth game. That’s when Alves ended the come-from-behind bid with an 11-9 victory.
More often, though, it was Crimson athletes claiming the key points. Freshman Amelia Henley, junior Alyssa Mehta, and Tutrone all won in five games.
Not all matches featured such drama. Evans and the sophomore Mehta swept the No. 8 and No. 9 positions, respectively. And at the top spot, Penn sophomore Reeham Sedkey blanked Sobhy, including an 11-1 final game.
Sophomore Kayley Leonard appeared at risk of a similar fate when she dropped her first game, 11-9. But Leonard rebounded to win the next three games and the overall match.
Likewise, at No. 7, Ann Young conceded the first game but proceeded to run off the next three—in this case by scores of 11-4, 11-2, and 11-3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team’s only win this season before Tuesday night had come on October 23 at Dartmouth. On Tuesday night in Bright-Landry Hockey Arena, the Crimson (2-13-2, 2-8-2 ECAC) faced off against the Big Green (5-13-0, 3-9-0) and were able to garner a similar result, coming through with a 2-1 win.
The team had been on a four game losing streak coming into the contest, but the wins have not been far away. Since Nov. 11, nine of 13 games have been lost by one goal or have ended in a tie, making the opportunity to push through and be on the winning end of the stick that much sweeter.
“I’m so psyched,” sophomore Kate Hallett said. “This is huge for us. To be honest ever since we started this second semester there has been a new vibe in the locker room and we are all really excited so we are just going to keep pushing each other to get better.”
Hallett broke the silence for Harvard first at the 2:26 mark when she was on the receiving end of a sequence of pinpoint passes from a junior Dani Krzyszczyk and sophomore Audrey Warner which allowed her to launch the puck into the back of the goal.
“Something we’ve been working on a lot the past couple weeks is net front and getting net front,” Hallett said. “In hockey the puck is always bouncing and you never know where it’s going to go so if you’re net front you’re ready to pounce and I just kept thinking that’s my job.”
Dartmouth answered right back less than three minutes later when Big Green senior Eleni Tebano broke away from the fray and drove to beat all defenders down the ice. She went one on one with senior goalie Brianna Laing and fooled her with a shot to the upper left hand corner.
In last five minutes of the first period the Crimson came knocking more than once on goalie Christie Honors’ door with shots by Hallett and senior Briana Mastel that went wide of the goal or were deflected before being gloved by the netminder.
The end result would come courtesy of sophomore attacker Kaitlin Tse, who picked up her second goal of the season with a rifle from just outside the faceoff circle courtesy of assists from captain Sydney Daniels and rookie Val Turgeon.
Unlike the past three contests where Harvard has given up a goal when its opponent was man-up as a result of a powerplay, the Crimson defended its powerplay well against Dartmouth. When junior Haley Mullins drew a penalty at 3:44 in the second period for a cross check, classmate Lexie Laing quickly got the puck out of the Harvard zone and gave herself the opportunity to score but was tripped up in front of the goal and could not convert her opportunity. After Mullins returned to the ice, the Crimson dominated control of the puck, with three consecutive shots on goal to test Honor.
Harvard was tested in the final two minutes of the contest as well when Laing was flagged for a tripping penalty that gave the Big Green an opportunity to pull their goalie and create a six-on-four situation until the end of the game. The defense stayed strong as the final buzzer sounded, cementing the team’s second victory.
“Your best penalty  killer is your goaltender and I think Bri did a great job tonight,” head coach Katey Stone said. “We did a great job in front of her too with our decisions. If we were going to pressure we were all over them and if we weren’t we’d lay off. We did a much better job coming up the ice too.”
When all was said and done, the Crimson left the ice having dominated offensively. Harvard led in both shots on goal and faceoff wins, with 31 in each respective category.
In goal senior Brianna Laing notched the win, improving her record to 2-4-0 on the season while making 24 saves.
“Obviously it feels pretty good to win and our kids got rewarded for their hard work,” Stone said. “We’ve talked about in other games how they’re worked their tails off and done a lot of things but haven’t been able to get over the hill and beat teams. So tonight was a really good victory, there were a lot of things we did well.”
