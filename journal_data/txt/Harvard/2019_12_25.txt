Is arts criticism a dying industry? How has social media changed arts journalism? How did we get here? In its “Live Arts Criticism Panel,” ArtsBoston assembled a panel of editors and critics to discuss the changing landscape of arts criticism and address the field’s biggest issues. Partnering with the Front Porch Arts Collective and the Boston Center for the Arts, ArtsBoston’s event drew together artists and critics from all over Boston’s art scene.
Hosted in the Plaza Black Box Theatre on Nov. 19, the event featured Kathryn Boland (dance critic), Maria Garcia (Senior Editor of WBUR’s The ARTery), Jameson Johnson (Editor-in Chief of Boston Art Review), Zoë Madonna (music critic at the Boston Globe), and Ed Siegel (critic-at-large at WBUR). Pascale Florestal, active in the Boston arts and theatre community, organized and moderated the event.
“My central goal around creating this panel was to give everyone in the arts criticism industry as well as people in the arts the opportunity to talk and have a dialogue about how the reporting and arts criticism have changed in the past years,” Florestal said.
The panel began with brief introductions of the panelists, and Florestal launched the discussion by asking how each of the panelists began writing criticism. Siegel kicked off by detailing his college work as a journalist, an experience shared by some of the other panelists. All the panelists, however, described radically different career routes. They were united by the fact that none of them intended to be in their current positions, and were instead guided by passion and circumstance.
Florestal then shifted the conversation to the recent changes in arts criticism, spurring a conversation around diversity, technology, and journalism. Garcia spoke on the changes to journalism and culture as a whole, while Madonna mentioned the power of social media in mobilizing fans and how such shifts have affected the role of critics.
When questioned about what changes they’d like to see, the panelists discussed facets of the arts criticism community. Siegel spoke on the “death of expertise,” while Garcia brought up diversity within the field, and Boland expressed a desire for the number of critics to increase.
Florestal concluded her moderated questions by asking about the differences between arts criticism in Boston and arts criticism elsewhere. Johnson and Siegel both highlighted the duality of Boston’s arts scene, with its depth and history but its smaller size and renown compared to New York City.
The panelists then took audience questions, which centered primarily around the role of social media and accessibility within the field. Closing out this portion of the evening, panelists gave budding arts critics advice, ranging from building a portfolio to contacting PR representatives.
After the discussion, audience members remained in the space, talking to the various panelists and other members of the community.
Spencer T. Icasiano, an attendee and arts writer for the ARTery, said he had further questions after the panelists finished.
“I couldn’t help but notice four of the five panelists were white, and none of them were black or indigenous people of color. This panel would have benefited from the perspectives of those who are the most marginalized among us. Those are some questions I still have,” Icasiano said.
Kristin S. Torres, a podcast producer and researcher at WBUR, commented on the content and issues covered by the panel.
“I was very interested in talking about pipeline issues, and how commentators of color can penetrate the arts criticism industry,” Torres said.
In response to the longer discussion on the role of social media, Torres responded, “I feel like the social media thing has been talked about so much, there’s no getting around it, it’s the way to reach audiences.”
Audience members and panelists alike stayed to socialize, and members of the community expressed a desire to continue this conversation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clairo walked out onto the stage at her Nov. 20 show at Paradise Rock Club in Boston exactly how you would want her to: unassuming, bubbly, and dressed like the bedroom popstar she is in a black sweatshirt, gray sweatpants, and a messy bun.
The Boston area native began her set with “Alewife,” a heartfelt tribute to the Red Line station’s impact on her youth, off of her new album, “Immunity.” With just one light coming from behind her, the performance was ethereal, her voice lifting effortlessly above the dreamy piano and her own guitar’s melody. The stage was decorated only with a semicircular screen projecting various moving images. During the next song, “Impossible,” the screen glowed with beautiful images of clouds. Her soft, sweet voice and impeccable runs dominated the song. The audience knew every single word.
“This song’s called ‘Softly,’” she said, announcing the jazzy song also from “Immunity.” The epitome of bedroom pop, the song featured mellow guitar playing and a syncopated drum beat. It was followed by a “How we feeling, Boston?” and the YouTube bred hit, “Flamin Hot Cheetos.” “I’m feeling something right,” she sang over and over in the song’s hypnotizing bridge, the crowd all swaying and shouting the lyrics in unison. “Drown” — her song with the Chicano singer-songwrite Cuco — and “Get With U” were both beautiful and smooth, blanketing the venue in a breezy trance.
“How’re we doing?” Clairo asked the audience in her small voice. “I remember seeing Arctic Monkeys here in 2015. I was stuck [watching from] behind a pole. Thank you so much for having me, it’s really a blessing,” she said before “Sis.” Images of suburbia dominated the screen behind her. The performance acted as a sort of homecoming for Clairo, noted in her next song, “Bubble Gum.” It began with just her guitar, as the rest of the band fell in slowly. The stage glowed a soft pink. As the audience sang along with the 2016 SoundCloud track, she began to get emotional. “Agh, I started crying already,” she said after finishing the song, a candid acknowledgement welcomed with cheers and applause.
“This song’s called ‘North.’ Come on, let’s dance,” she said, quickly lifting the heartfelt mood. The dancing mood was continued with her 2019 hit, “Bags.” “This one’s for you Boston!” she said as she jammed out with her three-piece band to the song’s catchy melody. “Sofia” received special live treatment, embellished by a complicated drum beat. “I just wanna say / How I love you with your hair down,” she sang as she undid her messy bun. At this moment, the whole room was alive with dancing. Everything coalesced into pure bliss as the iconic guitar riff filled the venue with an incredibly palpable energy.
For the next song, “White Flag,” Clairo seemed to surrender herself to her audience and the music, singing the entire time about loneliness from her seat at the edge of the stage. “I’m gonna need your help with this one,” she said before the bluesy “Feel Something,” as raindrops rolled down a windowpane on the screen. “Sinking,” a jazzy track also from “Immunity” was nothing short of beautiful, the lights bathing her in orange as she sang, her soft voice powerfully rising above pre-recorded heavenly harmonies. With “Closer To You,” the lights quickly changed to blue, signifying a change in mood as her lyrics shifted from melancholic to frustration with a relationship and to empowerment.
“Thank you so much for coming tonight. It feels really crazy to be here, I’m kinda freaking out. Thank you,” she said before bringing back the melancholia with “I Wouldn’t Ask You.” “Can we sing this together?” she asked softly, though the audience didn’t miss a single lyric the whole night. Here, the audience replaced the chorus from the studio recording as Clairo sang. Again, the vulnerability of her lyrics was only heightened by her place crouching at the stage’s edge. That is, until the song’s techno-infused reprise, during which she stood up and took up the entire stage with her presence. With her gorgeous vocals, the soft synths and cutting drum machine, and the audience filling the role of the chorus, the performance was perfect. It was heavenly.
“I love you more than Flamin Hot Cheetos!” said an audience member before Clairo introduced the next song, the unreleased “I Want More Time.” “I worked on a song that I really like playing. We started ending every show with it…. It’s really nice and I want to share it with you,” Clairo said. Only she and her guitar were on stage as she played the song’s lovely finger-picking melody, the entire room attentive under her spell.
“Thank you so much, Boston,” Clairo said before leaving the stage. It felt as though she was addressing a close friend.
For the encore, she treated fans to an incredibly fun rendition of “4EVER,” followed by her first ever hit, “Pretty Girl.” For the latter, the song’s viral YouTube video took up the screen and the crowd went wild as she crooned the memorable lyrics about trying to be the perfect girl. “I could be your pretty girl / I’ll wear a skirt for you / I could be your pretty girl / Shut up when you want me to,” she sang ironically.
“I don’t know if this is the type of song for a mosh pit...” she said before the final song of the night, her collaboration with EDM artist Mura Masa, “I Don’t Think I Can Do This Again.” Maybe it wasn’t the archetypal mosh pit song, but it didn’t matter. The crowd pulsed wildly as Clairo danced about on stage. It was the perfect ending to the concert as everyone completely let loose, losing themselves to the incessant thumping beat.
“Thank you, Boston! Thank you so much!” Clairo said before leaving the stage for good.
An orange screen remained glowing behind her. The only word emblazoned on it: “Immunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sleigh bells ring. Tiny lights twinkle and glisten, nestled in needle laden branches and wrapped around curling bannisters. The smell of evergreen trees and fresh snow seeps in from the outside, mingling with the thick scent of firewood turning to cinder and gingerbread cookies baking to a crisp, golden brown.
This is the idyllic winter of storybooks. But on a college campus, the closest one can get to the tinkling of bells is a morning alarm. It can be difficult to chop down an eight foot tall evergreen between 9:00 a.m. class and the club meeting looming in the afternoon, not to mention the challenge of fitting said tree into a dorm room. And don’t even think about lighting a cozy fire in your common room’s fireplace, if your room has one. But nevertheless, holiday spirit can be found all around if you know where to look.
A quick disclaimer: although Christmas is often a ubiquitous signifier of this jolly, wintertime cheer, many of us identify with another faith or no faith at all. Fortunately, many local happenings can be enjoyed as an entirely secular experience, celebrating community, philanthropy, the winter season, and those around us. Now, without further ado, here is a small selection from the many holiday events taking place in the Cambridge and Boston area in the coming weeks.

Something about turning the calendar page to December imbues many with a strong desire to give back. If you are among them, be sure to check out Faneuil Hall’s Holiday Mitten Tree. There you can hang up a pair of new or gently worn mittens, knowing they will find a wonderful home in the coming weeks.
The goal of the mitten tree is simple according to Edward Hurley, Faneuil Hall’s Marketing Director.
“Last year we decided that we wanted to give something back to the community. Therefore, we decided to install a Mitten Tree for the holidays so that those in need [can] take a pair of mittens to help stay warm,” Hurley said.
The tree is currently up, and donations will be collected until Dec. 31. This is also an opportunity to visit Faneuil Hall’s majestic holiday tree, the site of several other seasonal events, including Tuba Christmas. While this year’s concert has sadly passed, keep it in mind next year if the notion of hundreds of tubas playing holiday tunes sounds like your cup of eggnog.

Worry not — Boston has one winter tradition that is certainly a bit unexpected, and this year marks its 20th anniversary! The Santa Speedo Run began in 2000 when a group of five men decided to sprint down Newbury Street clothed in nothing but speedos and Santa hats. What began as a small stunt now features hundreds of participants and has raised nearly $2 million for children’s charities in the Boston area.
Participants in the Speedo Run must be at least 21, and the run is limited to the first 700 people who sign up. If the only thing holding you back is that you don’t own a speedo, there’s good news.
“We encourage runners to dress however they feel most festive! This could include all manner of holiday garb (Santa Suits, Yukon Cornelius outfits, Speedos, Reindeer horns, Christmas Onesies, Grinch Green),” the organizers of this year’s run write on their website.
If something more than lack of a speedo is keeping you from signing on, (frigid temperatures, anyone?), you can make an online donation.

If you are bogged down by final papers and exams and can barely imagine crawling out of the library, here is a solution that requires basically no travel time. Matinee and evening performances of “The Christmas Revels: An American Celebration of the Winter Solstice” will take place Dec. 13-29 in Harvard’s own Sanders Theatre.
Founded in 1971 by legendary concert baritone John Langstaff alongside his daughter Carol, the Revels show celebrates, “the music and customs of cultures around the world.” The show is entirely new each year. While last year’s production featured a Nordic theme, this year’s show will focus on American folk tales and cultural traditions.
“What we do is try and frame the music and the customs, the little rituals that happen in a culture,” artistic director Patrick Swanson said. “Within any given culture, the things that people really appreciate, really treasure about their own culture, frequently end up in songs and games and dances and bits of stories. And that's passed on, usually orally, from father to son and mother to daughter. And that's the stuff that we're interested in.”
The team works with a series of “tradition bearers” to get a first hand account of the world they will feature. This exhaustive research process has a profound impact on the show itself and the people who perform it.
“It was a complete musical immersion for me. And connecting with people who are experts in the field, especially the tradition bearers, helped to shape a lot of the show,” music director Megan Henderson said.
“The audience will leave with a taste of it, but these hundred people, including the kids, who have been up close, experiencing this, [are] I think transformed in some way. It makes people more aware of the fact that these are not others. These are the different versions of ourselves,” Swanson added.
And on that note, regardless of how you choose to celebrate this season, here’s wishing everyone a healthy and joyous new year.
