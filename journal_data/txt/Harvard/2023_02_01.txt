After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly one year ago, student government at Harvard College was ensnared by a variety of controversies. Following an election cycle where the winning ticket pledged to dismantle the system, scandals arose over alleged financial irregularities, debates over constitutional interpretations, and accusations of bullying. The Crimson, in an effort to fulfill its journalistic responsibilities, covered each meeting and reported out to students about the imploding system.
But that was a year ago. One year later, it appears that The Crimson is more interested in reporting on a system marred with controversy and chaos than it is sharing with students information about pertinent programs and initiatives — even if it means manufacturing the controversy.
To conceptualize this, one can take a look at the headline of the most recent HUA article, titled, “‘Not Here as a Receipt Police’: HUA Grant Usage Not Typically Monitored, Officers Say at Weekly Meeting.” At this meeting, which lasted over one hour, the Harvard Undergraduate Association allocated $9,000 in funding to promote academic inclusivity and help offset the cost of books for students. Moreover, the organization and its members voted in favor of a referendum to create two new teams, the Inclusion Team and the First-Year Team — both of which were requested by students. Rather than reporting on these developments, however, The Crimson appears to have latched on to minutiae to prompt scrutiny and criticism.
The truth is that the HUA’s receipt review process was designed based on the expert recommendations of professional auditors from Harvard University’s Office of Risk Management & Audit Services. To set the record straight, we routinely audit the purchases made by student organizations, and the book fund program requires receipts. It is disappointing when information about major developments and proposals is omitted in favor of clickbait.
This is a recurring pattern when it comes to The Crimson’s reporting on student government. Another example of The Crimson’s provocative coverage of student government occurred when the organization allocated money to support students through a professional clothing closet and funded DataMatch, an organization that exists to help foster connections between students. The title of the December 2022 article, “Harvard Undergraduate Association Allocates Nearly $17,000 in Funding at Final Fall Meeting,” bears no mention of either initiative. Compare that with the headline of an article published in 2021, and one can see the glaring difference in coverage emphasis. Why is The Crimson suddenly opposed to publishing headlines about projects such as the professional clothing closet, which will remove financial barriers for low-income students?
It is critical that The Crimson use its platform to share balanced and accurate information about student government with its readers. In fact, there’s precedent for it. Prior to the collapse of the previous student government system, headlines regularly mentioned the types of projects the organization discussed and voted on. Today, that is the exception rather than the norm — and it isn’t due to a lack of initiatives. Student government deserves scrutiny when warranted, but it is also imperative that students have accurate information on which to base their scrutiny and thoughts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before my classmates and I even set foot on campus as students, we had already received an impressive collection of school merchandise: a Harvard cap, a Harvard phone pocket, a Harvard t-shirt, a page of Harvard stickers. I was thrilled to finally be a part of this community, and I appreciated Harvard’s gesture. But this also marked the beginning of something far less exciting: a seemingly never-ending barrage of free merchandise that masks environmental damage and overconsumption under the guise of school spirit.
There is nothing wrong with wanting to collect a few items of clothing and other accessories that represent one’s school. And at Harvard, students aren’t the only ones demanding loads of logo-filled accessories — as illustrated by the numerous gift shops around Harvard Square catering to tourists who want a material souvenir to bring back from their visit. Everything from sweatshirts and shot glasses to dog leashes and infant onesies, adorned with the Harvard name and crest, line the walls of shops throughout Massachusetts Avenue and John F. Kennedy Street.
Perhaps, for tourists, merchandise sells because people like to have some sort of proof that they have been here or merely want to feel more in touch with a storied institution (after all, some of those onesies do read “Future Freshman”). But as Harvard students, our belonging to this community is not in question. We have no affiliation to prove, no need for souvenirs. Yet we continue to rely on excessive amounts of merchandise as some sort of manifestation of our belonging — to the College and to our houses, concentrations, and clubs.
It’s time to reexamine our reliance on merchandise as a student body. I expect we’ll find that any intangible benefits pale in comparison to the very real costs. The creation of a single cotton t-shirt requires around 2,700 liters of water and produces nearly 15 pounds of carbon. That means that producing t-shirts for every undergraduate enrolled at the College ends up costing more than 19 million liters of water and 106,000 pounds of carbon. These numbers feel distant when students are faced with the offer of another free t-shirt, but they drive at the heart of the climate crisis, with the fashion industry fueling up to 10 percent of carbon emissions across the globe.
One could argue that merchandise is a crucial way of showing the pride we take in our school —, of demonstrating our commitment to the College and our different communities within it. That is true, if we allow it to be. But we can also choose a different path — one that accepts limitations on the material goods we demand in order to help out our planet.
Perhaps the first Class of 2025 t-shirt did make me feel closer to this community, more like an actual Harvard student. But can most of us say the same about every subsequent Harvard blanket, water bottle, freshman Yard t-shirt, House t-shirt, Harvard-Yale game sweater, and plastic Housing Day medal we may receive (to name just a few)?
Our excessive consumption of free merchandise has offered me more climate anxiety than it has school spirit. It is particularly frustrating that one of the world’s leading research institutions, whose first and foremost role is to educate future generations, in some ways appears apathetic to that future.
I feel no closer to Harvard by being in a sea of crimson-colored sweatshirts, and I feel no closer to my House by wearing a t-shirt featuring our (admittedly great) polar bear mascot. At the end of the day, we can still be the loudest supporters at sports stadiums and the most united Houses on Housing Day without relying on merchandise to prove it. What binds our community together, rather, is the time we spend together, the activities that unite and inspire us, and our capacity to include and learn from each other.
The most compassionate thing we can do to show support for ourselves, our classmates, and the future of our school is to take care of the earth that we live on. That would be a much stronger show of solidarity and mutual engagement than the performativity of identical t-shirts. And if Harvard is looking for ways to spend its $50.9 billion endowment, it might consider investing in our future through climate-positive action.
School spirit is great — but so is the need to preserve the environment of the only planet we have. I’d be willing to trade in a few sweatshirts for the latter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Your decisions shape your life. Whether you go on to do great things or never quite fulfill your potential comes down to what you chose to do or not to do.
But making decisions is hard, whether it’s between pursuing your passion for film or a prestigious finance gig, or deciding between the grille or the entrée of the day at the dining hall. As a result, many of us are tempted to keep all our doors open and make up our minds later.
This decision-making paralysis has had a spectacular rebrand into a wise-sounding phrase you’ve no doubt heard: “preserving optionality.” This doctrine of keeping doors open promises the ability to press pause on your decisions while moving forward with your life.
But this is a fantasy, albeit one that’s awfully seductive. Tough decisions are not only inevitable but, in many ways, are necessary to unlock the parts of our lives that we cherish the most.
Here are some lessons to keep in mind at your next fork in the road.
We like preserving optionality because it feels like there’s no downside. More time to decide? Great! But make no mistake: The time you buy comes at the cost of a shrinking option set.
Oftentimes, the most ambitious paths require the earliest commitments. One of our friends, for example, decided to become a serious tennis player before he hit high school; his peers, who took much longer to decide, never quite caught up.
The lesson here isn’t to commit yourself to a path too early, but instead that there is a real cost to waiting. Many of the most exceptional options are only open to those who commit.
When we face tough decisions, the easy way out is to postpone making them entirely.
We tend to think that the answer will come to us if we give it more time. But often, we end up knowing as much (or little) about our futures as before.
This tendency to overestimate how much wiser our future selves will be is understandable — after all, having lived longer implies that we have more information. And, more information leads to better decisions, right?
Not really. Waiting a year to find yourself may not teach you about the advantages of electrical engineering over the pre-med track. So, don’t overestimate your future self: Odds are that you will be largely the same person, and less wise than you’d hoped you would be. Unless you spend time to…
Another danger of preserving optionality is that it prevents you from finding what you actually want to do.
For example, if you’re not sure whether you want to go into the public sector or pursue a career in venture capital, doing something neutral that in theory keeps both options open, like management consulting, won’t actually teach you much about the two options you’re truly considering.
Here, preserving optionality is a little bit like going to a new restaurant and trying to find your go-to meal. There are various options, so why not put them all in a blender and get a little bit of everything? That’s what the optionality compromise often ends up being: somewhat related to all your favored options, but fruitless for the ultimate decision you have to make.
When it comes to your future, leave the blender at home.
Decisions that you can’t cleanly back out of, as opposed to more flexible two-way door decisions, are uncomfortable and scary.
But many of life’s most important and, ultimately, fulfilling decisions — which college to attend, where to spend your early career, or whom to marry — are highly committal. This is what Oliver Burkeman in his book Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals calls the “joy of missing out”: the idea that “the renunciation of alternatives is what makes [your] choice a meaningful one in the first place.”
In a study done by professor Daniel T. Gilbert on photography students at Harvard, participants had a choice between two photographs they’d taken that semester to take home. In one group, they were told the decision is final: The one they choose is the one they get. In the other group, they’d have the ability to swap the print they chose for the other one later if they changed their mind.
Interestingly, the students that made the irreversible decision were substantially more satisfied with their selection than the students able to change their minds. Despite this, students across both groups overwhelmingly preferred to be assigned to the group with the option of switching photos. In other words, although we crave optionality, it might not be what’s best for us.
There’s one big caveat to all of these lessons: They’re meant to be tools for making decisions if you don’t know what you want. But if you do know, start doing that right away.
If you find yourself saying things like “I’m going to do X so that I can get Y and finally do Z,” start looking for ways to do Z today. Be methodical in learning your goals, but convicted in achieving them.
Whatever you do, don’t enroll yourself in the deferred life plan. Make the tough decisions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much ink has been spilled pointing out the sorry state of mental health on Harvard’s campus. Something clearly needs to change.
The problem is: This is far easier said than done. Expanding Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services, though certainly necessary, is nowhere near sufficient. The shortage of psychotherapists is a national problem, as demand for therapy has skyrocketed post-pandemic; initiatives to hire more therapists at Harvard would face the same pitfalls of scarcity that the general public does. As it stands, even if CAMHS were to double in size, each CAMHS clinician would need to take on over 98 clients to support the bare minimum 25 percent of the undergraduate and graduate student body suffering from psychological distress — not counting the faculty and staff that also rely on CAMHS. All told, this adds up to what seems like a thoroughly unsustainable caseload.
So what’s a $50.9 billion institution to do?
Our best hope for providing care at the scale necessary to address the mental health crisis at Harvard (and possibly in the world at large) is layperson psychotherapists — that is, non-professionals who have been briefly trained in psychotherapy by a professional.
In other words, if you can’t hire more therapists, then make them.
At first glance, this seems like an insane idea, but I promise you that it is not. This concept is well-backed by scientific literature, and has been implemented, at scale, to successfully treat over a hundred thousand people for depression. It also pushes us to take a second glance at some of our deeply held beliefs about therapy — namely, the idea that struggles with mental health should be solved within the exclusive purview of medical professionals. Though treatments by psychiatrists and psychologists are clearly extremely effective, there are many ways to skin a psychological cat.
Take for example, StrongMinds, a non-governmental organization based out of Uganda and Zambia that uses peer-facilitated group interpersonal psychotherapy to provide care for women with depression. Over the last decade, they have helped over 210,000 women, accomplished entirely with trained members. StrongMinds prepares facilitators with a short course in interpersonal psychotherapy, then recruits former group members to coordinate future group therapy sessions. The result is an exponentially growing therapeutic capacity, at a lower price. In 2022, StrongMinds’s cost per patient was $79; contrast this to the average $100 to $200 cost per session of psychotherapy in the United States. Peer facilitation doesn’t come at the cost of efficacy either: Six months after the conclusion of treatment, 80 percent of StrongMinds patients are depression-free.
This sort of approach has been validated among American college students as well. In the 1970s, a pair of Vanderbilt researchers attempted to understand whether trained therapists produced better treatment outcomes. They selected one group of experienced psychotherapists and a second group of professors chosen for their ability to form warm and trustworthy relationships with students. The trained therapists and the untrained professors each provided between three and four months of therapy to a subset of students. In the end, all students demonstrated equivalent (and statistically significant) levels of psychological improvement — despite the differences in training and qualifications between their therapy providers.
This study should not be read as a refutation of the value of professional therapeutic training — these were, after all, specially selected professors — but rather should make it clear that there is a vast reservoir of therapeutic talent that remains untapped. By educating already compassionate individuals, we can create a highly effective group of lay therapists at Harvard, at a scale significant enough to change the mental health landscape on campus.
Harvard has no shortage of warm, kind, caring professionals throughout its facilities, including proctors, house tutors, professors, and staff. It seems eminently possible to train a group of selected such people in a form of therapy that has been clinically validated for layperson facilitation. The resulting therapy could be provided on a volunteer basis (though ideally volunteer therapists would be compensated for their time).
In any case, effective psychotherapy can be made available to Harvard students on short notice, rerouting CAMHS clinicians to focus on more complex cases. This creates a rapid pathway for referring those with severe depression or anxiety to a professional, allowing for significantly more proactive care. Layperson psychotherapists operate in a similar role to EMTs in hospital systems: They solve life-threatening health problems with relatively minimal training.
The effectiveness of layperson therapists hints at a deeper truth about psychotherapy: Therapy is not an arcane art, passed down through the hallowed guilds of Freud and Beck, but rather a structured human relationship. With this in mind, we can start to look past endless medicalization, and begin to think about solutions to mental illness that don’t cost up to $200 per hour. By leveraging Harvard’s considerable resources, this kind of therapy could grant far more students access to effective psychological care, reshaping the mental health landscape on campus with more scalable methods.

Harvard University Dining Services announced on Tuesday that it will roll out an array of updates to meal offerings for the spring semester, including new lunch options and international-themed brunches and dinners.
The changes are in response to a student survey conducted by HUDS, which solicited feedback on food quality and information about dietary habits. According to the emailed announcement, more than a quarter of undergraduates participated in the survey.
Changes coming to the dining service include themed brunches, a wider breakfast variety, and “deconstructed themed menus” on Monday and Wednesday nights. These menus are designed to allow students to create “highly customizable dishes,” with themes such as mezze, dim sum, and ramen.
On Tuesdays and Fridays, HUDS will also offer grill specials such as Memphis hot chicken sandwiches, schnitzel, carnitas, and birria tacos.
New lunch options will focus on “lighter, portable fare,” like hot sandwiches, artichoke flatbread, and vegan cottage pie, according to the email. Starting on Feb. 15, HUDS will launch brunches inspired by global and regional cuisines. Menus for other meals will feature dishes from countries including China, France, Lebanon, Spain, and Thailand, according to the announcement.
Still, some students met the promise of expanded global fare with trepidation.
“I guess it’s hard because you’re mass cooking,” Kai B.J. Wong ’26 said. “Sometimes I get excited when I see something Japanese or Chinese, and then I’ll eat it and it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s not the same dish, but it’s okay.’”
Others embraced any opportunity for new options.
“Gonna make the dhall more interesting this time around,” Ivan A. Garcia ’25 said.
Notably absent from the changes is an expanded hot breakfast option, a longtime request from students. In November 2022, nearly 2,000 undergraduates signed a petition for hot breakfast service across all upperclassman dining halls.
Some students said they were disappointed by the omission.
“It’s ridiculous,” Shaina L. Adams ’26 said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me.”
HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin has previously stated that HUDS works “in close coordination” with the College to make decisions around dining hall operations and “manage financial resources efficiently without compromising community goals.”
On weekdays, hot breakfast is currently only served in Annenberg Hall and Quincy House, which Noah H. Chung ’26 said raises concerns about whether dining options are “equitable.”
“Either they should have absolutely no hot breakfast for all of them or have it for everyone,” Chung said.

Harvard Divinity School hosted a discussion on the presence of enslavement and enslaved people in early Christian stories at a virtual forum Monday night.
The event — the first in the series of public online conversations titled “Religion and Legacies of Slavery” — aims to build on Harvard’s landmark Legacy of Slavery report released in April 2022, which detailed how slavery “powerfully shaped” the school. The discussion was led by HDS professor Karen L. King; Diane L. Moore, faculty director of religion and public life; and Melissa Wood Bartholomew, associate dean of diversity, inclusion, and belonging.
During the discussion, King listed several areas in which enslavement runs through New Testament literature: the presence of enslaved persons and enslavers, references to enslavement in Jesus’s parables, discussion of the roles of enslaved and enslavers in Christian households, and the social assumptions that shaped underlying news, ethics, political life.
“The presence of enslaved people in ideologies, discourses, and practices — these enslavement permeate Christian stories and teachings, which themselves express a wide variety of attitudes, aims and assumptions involving complex relations with different groups in different ways,” King said.
“Examining these may sharpen our capacity to take account of religion in addressing and redressing the legacies of enslavement at Harvard and beyond,” she added.
King discussed how readers of the Bible have appealed to the text to support both slavery as an institution and its abolition, referencing the “Slave Bible” — originally titled “Parts of the Holy Bible, selected for the use of the Negro Slaves, in the British West-India Islands” — as a historical example of her point.
“Even though this Bible was produced by abolitionists, in order to secure the support of the slavers, they agreed to publish a select version that emphasized the duties of enslaved persons to their masters, and they left out much that might encourage the thoughts of resistance, escape or freedom,” King said.
According to King, some passages in the New Testament commonly used to rationalize slavery and racism have been “racialized in white supremacy” and “used to justify Christian slavers as righteous.”
“But another legacy is to develop a theology of God who shares in pain and suffering, and who requires justice to promote resistance to enslavement as an unjust institution, to tell other stories — complex stories, true stories — and for us to ask more about religion and the legacies of slavery,” King said.

Harvard has not publicly responded to allegations of abusive behavior by Harvard women’s ice hockey head coach Katey Stone reported in a Boston Globe investigation Friday.
The Globe reported that 16 former players, including former captains, voiced complaints about Stone’s inappropriate comments and behavior — alleging she has “denigrated” players “in ways that made them demoralized, anxious, confused, or seeking mental health support.”
The Globe’s report contains accounts from players who claim Stone was insensitive to players’ mental health issues and downplayed injuries. Stone faced a monthslong formal review in 2022 — after she allegedly made discriminatory remarks following a disappointing game — but remained in place as head coach.
Stone did not respond to a request for comment regarding the allegations.
In an email sent to the women’s ice hockey team and its affiliates on Jan. 18 — prior to the publication of the article — Stone addressed the impending report and said she has “tried to consistently listen to suggestions and accept feedback” from players and Harvard Athletics.
“This year, I have made it a priority as your coach to acknowledge and respond to direct feedback from the women in my program about my coaching style, and make concerted effort to better support my players’ experiences,” Stone wrote.
“With that goal in mind, I have sought to strengthen my communications and engagement skills,” she added.
Ahead of the article’s publication, 46 team alumni wrote a letter to Robert T. Hohler — the Globe journalist who investigated Stone — offering their contact information in order to give a “broader and more complete picture of players’ experiences.”
“We respect every person’s individual right to communicate their story and their truth, and the importance of doing so for one’s own healing, as well as to promote positive change,” the alumni wrote in an email obtained by The Crimson.
After her team’s first-round loss to Princeton in the Eastern College Athletic Conference playoffs, Stone allegedly went on a “degrading and dispiriting” tirade, describing the group as a team “with too many chiefs and not enough Indians.”
Maryna G. Macdonald ’23, a starting player from the Ditidaht First Nation of Canada’s Vancouver Island, told the Globe that Stone looked directly at Macdonald when she made the remark.
After Stone’s remarks, Macdonald reported her to Harvard Athletics, and Stone soon apologized to the team, according to the Globe.
In an April 8, 2022, email obtained by The Crimson, Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott shared with members of the team a plan for a formal review of Stone, referencing a recent meeting and “conflict.”
“The greater understanding that we have from different people will best inform any next steps that we identify, with the aim of improving your experience, whether that’s athletically or academically, or both,” McDermott wrote. “We are using this opportunity to take a ‘deeper dive’ into your experience and be as helpful as possible in the end.”
After a monthslong administrative review, McDermott sent an email on July 19 to the team with the subject line “Onward and Upward,” writing, “Coach Stone is our head coach and will remain our head coach.”
“The findings of the review affirm that decision while also identifying opportunities for improvement, particularly with communication across several areas,” McDermott added.
Macdonald ultimately left the team, along with Taze E. Thompson, a descendant of the Cree Nation of Alberta, Canada, who was named the 2021-22 Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Thompson transferred to Northeastern University following the 2021-2022 season.
Macdonald and Thompson are just two of the 14 recruited athletes who have quit the team since 2016, according to the Globe’s investigation.
The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations — an organization representing 74 First Nations in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan — publicly called for Stone’s resignation on Tuesday and sent a letter to Harvard Athletics demanding her removal as head coach.
“Racism has no place in our society or locker rooms. A place where we entrusted our First Nations young women would be free from abuse and racism,” FSIN Third Vice Chief Aly Bear said in a statement.
“This abuse should not be tolerated by any university, especially a highly regarded institution such as Harvard University,” she added. “I truly hope Harvard will stand with the Indigenous students and protect future students from this type of racist behaviour.”
Sydney Daniels ’17, a member of the Mistawasis Nehiyawak First Nation of Saskatchewan, left her position as assistant coach and filed a complaint against Harvard for alleged racial and other forms of discrimination related to Stone and the athletics department, according to the Globe.
The Globe also reported that Stone has been accused of exhibiting “little tolerance for those confronting emotional challenges,” allegedly telling a former team leader who was receiving mental health care to “toughen up and not be a burden to your teammates.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the allegations against Stone, citing Harvard Athletics policy against commenting on personnel matters, but said athletes are made aware of processes for filing complaints at the start of each academic year.
“Student-Athletes initiate a process by reaching out to their respective sport administrator via email or scheduling a meeting, if they have complaints,” Dane wrote. “An appropriate process follows of interviews with affected individuals.”
“Decisions are made in consultation with Harvard administrative offices when necessary of how to move forward,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council and Cambridge School Committee discussed plans for an “equity audit” by a Harvard-affiliated consulting group at a joint budget meeting Monday.
Councilors and committee members detailed an impending two-year assessment of its budgeting process by Thrive! — a consulting group incubated in Harvard Innovation Labs — as well as other plans for the future of the district and its 2024 budget at the virtual meeting Monday evening.
The School Committee is set to partner with the Cambridge Community Foundation to implement the audit of the district’s budgeting practices beginning in 2024.
“There is a consultant group — Thrive! — which will be conducting an assessment of our expenditures and policies with the purpose of exploring how our budget process and resource allocation aligns to equity and success for students,” said Claire B. Spinner, Chief Financial Officer for CPS.
Thrive! — founded by Omolara O. Fatiregun ’00 — will use its academic research on investments in equity to compare and assess the district’s performance. Fatiregun said in Monday’s meeting that the group’s work is most effective when conducted in partnership with school officials.
“It was most important to get school board, the district really partnering with us through a relationship to best understand their practices and obtain points from their perspective,” Fatiregun said.
The meeting also explored the city’s other educational initiatives, including those to support increased math and literacy proficiency and a universal preschool system.
City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 outlined a long-term implementation process for the city’s proposed universal preschool initiative. Huang said universal preschool would have a “pretty significant impact on the budget,” and may be more feasible in fiscal year 2025, but that the city can “create a bit of a ramp” by beginning to plan in this year’s budget.
“There’s a lot of planning that needs to happen before universal pre-K happens,” he said.
Victoria L. Greer, superintendent at Cambridge Public Schools, discussed the district plan for the next three years, outlining the School Committee’s 2024 focus on the areas of college and career experiences, universal preschool, self-evaluation systems, and professional learning.
“It was extremely important to our School Committee and our administration that we not only have realistic goals but also aspirational targets,” Greer said.
The School Committee began planning and analyzing the next year’s budget during the fall, before developing the proposed budget early this year. The budget will undergo review by the School Committee between mid-March and early April. Once adopted, the budget will be submitted to the city manager and City Council for final approval and adoption into the city budget.
During Monday’s meeting, the committee discussed the goal of increasing literacy and math proficiency to 100 percent of grade-level expectations by 2025. Greer said the committee hopes to allocate a portion of the budget to a “pretty comprehensive plan for not only strategic tutoring but also targeted tutoring.”
Spinner said the budgeting process prioritized collaboration with students and their families. She added that the district held four community meetings and offered multilingual materials on the budget process throughout last year, as well as conducting a survey of families in the district earlier this month.
“As part of our overall budget planning process, we do have a fairly robust community engagement process,” Spinner said.
The School Committee will host an additional meeting with students to discuss the budget for the upcoming fiscal year Tuesday morning at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. The final budget proposal will be presented by Greer to the School Committee on March 14.

Harvard Law School hosted a conference featuring legal scholars, lawyers, and legal journalists who discussed the impact that corporate interests have on legal education and the legal system on Friday and Saturday.
The Systemic Justice Project — an initiative led by HLS professor Jon D. Hanson to educate law students about issues of justice within the legal system — and the project’s offshoot publication, “The [F]law,” organized the two-day conference, titled “Corporate Capture of the Legal System.”
Former U.S. presidential candidate, political activist, and attorney Ralph Nader opened the event with a moderated conversation during which he criticized the U.S. government for protecting large corporations.
“We have a corporate crime wave in this country,” Nader said.
He urged students to see how these corporations have “immunities not accorded to small businesses,” such as “bailouts, subsidies, giveaways, exonerations, and being too big to fail.”
Nader, who recently penned an open letter to HLS students urging them to be cautious of corporate law, added that while the Law School aimed to “educate leaders who contribute to the enhancement of justice and the well-being of society,” it has been the “main progenitor of corporate attorneys in the country.”
U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) also spoke at the conference about the role that corporate money plays in politics and the legal system.
“There’s literally nobody who isn’t funded by corporate dark money who doesn’t want corporate dark money out of politics,” he said.
In another panel at the conference, Hanson and MIT emeritus professor Noam Chomsky discussed how corporations exert their influence on public opinion through spending on public relations.
Hanson said corporations “manufacture” a “coercion story,” one in which corporations are forced to submit to regulations, the will of shareholders, and the consent of the consumer, rendering them powerless. But Hanson said such a “story” is “the ultimate attribution error.”
“It’s the way in which we tell stories that leave outgroup members, who have been harmed, accountable and responsible for their own harms and leave ingroup members, who are powerful, immune from any responsibility or accountability in most forms,” he said.
Hanson closed his remarks by calling for united pushback against corporate power.
“This is a time to come together,” he said.
