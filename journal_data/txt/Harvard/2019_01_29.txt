After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A startling line from the recent lawsuit filed by social groups against Harvard accused the University of believing that those “who join single-sex organizations are do not [sic] act like modern men and women,” but rather in ways that are “at odds with the aspirations of [a] 21st century society.”
But what is a “21st century society,” and how should its members act?
Furthermore, are single-gender organizations really incompatible with “21st century society?” It’s a question I’ve been asking, as a graduate of an all girls’ school, long before the sanctions debacle. Granted, I may be biased, but I think the answer is firmly no.
Being single gender isn’t the problem, and one of my main issues with the sanctions rollout is that Harvard has at times strayed dangerously close to insinuating that. The administration’s newer rationale for the sanctions — that they are trying to get rid of gender discrimination — sidesteps the questions of whether gendered groups can be useful and what, exactly, is wrong with students deciding they want to associate with people of the same gender in their free time. Furthermore, Harvard’s attempts to regulate which single-gender groups are permissible and which are not will only lead down a slippery slope (couldn’t acapella groups, for example, be considered de facto social clubs?).
Just because being single gender is not inherently a problem, however, does not mean that all single-gender groups should be given a free pass. They should be treated like other institutions. They should respond to changing times, and those responses define them.
A good example of such evolution is the creation of policies for transgender students at some single-sex schools. Trans students are not numerous enough, and gender is not yet meaningless enough, to pose an existential threat to single-sex education, but nevertheless these issues deserve addressing.
Quite a few single-sex K-12 and college institutions have begun addressing these issues with varying policies. I was proud when my old school announced, last year, that it will consider all applicants who identify as female and continue to support any current students who stop identifying as female. It also emphasized, however, that its mission remains the championing of girls’ education and women’s advancement, so it expects all students to support that mission. I found the policy a balanced one that, even though it does not personally affect me, made me prouder to be an alumna.
Such policies may seem contradictory. The main objection is the one that sounds like a 21st century riddle: If there are boys at a girls’ school, can it still be a girls’ school? But this question has little practical relevance. Trans-friendly policies will only affect a few students, but signal to everyone their openness and willingness to adapt. So even if these schools compromise their missions a little, at least they’re doing so for admirable reasons.
Contrast this with the response from many of Harvard’s single-gender social organizations, especially the male-only groups, to increasing challenges on their exclusivity. Their 20th-century Harvard alumni are trying to stay in their bubble because leaving would require emerging into a society that no longer looks as homogenous and no longer wants to submit to their power as easily. They have dug in their heels and reached into their wallets because they can’t stomach any threat to their old college social club. They now borrow the word “discrimination” in a way that mocks the progress made not just in the 21st, but also in the 20th, century.
The plaintiffs’ allegation about being seen as outside of the “21st century society” is revealing because it’s actually self-incriminating. These groups are rather backwards — not because their members want to throw parties with people of the same gender, but because they are abdicating their responsibility to evolve. Though they may not deserve the College’s sanctions for their continued existence, their ploy to paint themselves as victims is more than a bit too rich.
Single-gender organizations and modernity are not mutually exclusive. In whatever groups “modern men or women” choose to belong, it is more important that they be focused on looking forward and adapting to change rather than looking back and denying its presence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, political polarization has led to silence and lack of civil discussion. Despite a high population of politically active students, there is relatively little to no dialogue between those with different political views. While the University could aid in addressing this problem, it is primarily the responsibility of the student body to change this attitude toward politics.
As a conservative, I have always faced difficulty expressing my political opinions. From class discussions where the majority held an opposing opinion to one-on-one conversations where expression of my beliefs was met with disrespect and hostility, I struggled to find my voice. In high school, I was a minority in a school that was overwhelmingly liberal. When I created the Teenage Republicans club at my high school, my intention was never to be a conservative activist. Rather, it was to be a political conversationalist. I brought this sentiment with me to Harvard knowing the liberal lean of this campus.
Despite my initial fear of being a lone conservative voice, I knew discourse was critical to upholding the democratic values of our country. I hoped to change the state of politics in my community by being enriched by different perspectives at Harvard. I desired to be an advocate for a conducive society where everyone is able to freely discuss their different political opinions. I expected that Harvard students could understand that while we may disagree we could do so respectfully. I expected that Harvard students would be able to see that even our vehement disagreement was not rooted in hatred for one another but in a stronger shared passion: the desire to see and do what is best for our country. I expected freedom of thought and expression. I expected maturity. However, it seemed I expected too much.
At Harvard, I have witnessed a lack of intellectual maturity and civil discussion on multiple occasions. For example, during the Kavanaugh hearings, I found myself having to justify my point of view from an onslaught of attacks and insults. My friend and I went to a Kavanaugh protest just to have a civil discussion with those on the opposing side; instead, we were yelled at and told to leave. Earlier this month, when I attempted to express my pro-life beliefs, I was again met with disrespect and demonization instead of civility and maturity. I would expect to see this at my high school, but not at one of the best academic institutions in the world. Harvard prides itself on being an institution that promotes diversity and inclusion. However, I do not see this correlation to diversity of thought and opinion. What is the point of everyone looking different but thinking the same?
Harvard cannot call itself a diverse academic institution without creating spaces where civil discourse can flourish. Conservatives are by far a small minority in higher education and at Harvard. It begs the question if this is due to the qualifications of conservative applicants or justifiable concerns conservatives might have about attending schools with an overwhelming liberal majority. If it is the latter, Harvard and its student body must aim to change the campus atmosphere. The goal of education is to expose students to new concepts and ideas through teaching them to interact with different perspectives. If higher education becomes dominated by an echo chamber culture where expression of differing opinions is met by hostility, then the very purpose of education is defeated.
One way the student body can address this problem is by making current conservative students and potential applicants feel more comfortable voicing their opinions by inviting conservative speakers. Student groups such as the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative, whose goal is to invite a diverse array of speakers to campus to challenge the dominant political opinion and open discourse, should be promoted more. Even groups like the Harvard Democrats, Harvard Republicans, or Harvard Libertarians Club could make efforts to promote civil discussion between their organizations without the pretenses of debate or argument, such as holding monthly gatherings where members from different groups have lunch and talk about issues in a friendly respectful manner. Outside of student groups, we as individuals should make the effort to converse with those with whom we disagree. I know I myself tend to only interact with conservatives who share my ideology. We should, however, take the initiative to step outside of our comfort zone and echo chambers to converse with those holding opposing views.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana claims that the Harvard experience should be “transformative.” But how can minds be transformed if differing opinions are shut down? Harvard claims that its mission is to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,” but it creates a campus where conservatives and others who hold minority opinions feel marginalized for speaking their mind. If Harvard and its student body want to live up to the mission it claims to serve, then it must create a campus that fosters civil discourse, no matter the issue.

Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” is perhaps the most notoriously bloated course on campus. It seems like almost every other freshman you meet is enrolled in the course, and almost every other Harvard senior has taken the course at some point in their illustrious college careers. It is supposedly taught by the world-renowned economist N. Gregory Mankiw, but in reality, it is really taught by tired graduate students with some background in economics. Some enrolled students may still be very much enthused about Ec 10, but the vast majority have more than a few bones to pick with the course and Mankiw himself. From exorbitantly overpriced textbooks to the narrow economic framework students are exposed to, Ec 10 has a lot of room for improvement, to say the least.
To begin with, enrolling in the course comes with a hefty $132 price tag. Every student is forced to purchase new a loose-leaf copy of Mankiw’s textbook in order to receive an access code to an online software on which all problem set questions and quizzes must be completed. With hundreds of students enrolled in the course each year, it is not hard to imagine the sheer amount of money Mankiw rakes in from this monopoly on textbooks. Sure, after facing backlash, Mankiw declared that royalties from his course materials would be donated to charity, but that merely sidesteps the crux of the issue at hand — the costly barrier of enrollment and the inaccessibility of the course. Students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged should not have to face additional financial strain to enroll in classes they have academic interests in. The fact that it is an important prerequisite for several concentrations further compounds the necessity of Ec 10 being more financially accessible to students of all backgrounds.
Besides exorbitantly priced textbooks, the greatest problem with Ec 10 is its curriculum — the singular approach to economics that is taught. Students are exposed to one framework for interpreting economic and policy principles, for evaluating economic failures, and for resolving economic problems. Students are taught that market efficiency is often fundamentally opposed to equity, the economy more often does better with the market regulating itself, and market competitivity always creates better economic outcomes. In his textbook, Mankiw argues that equity and efficiency are “two goals [which] often conflict,” that policies such as progressive taxation often sacrifice too much market efficiency to achieve more equality, and that free trade is beneficial for the development of all countries. Empirical evidence contrary to these neoliberal assertions exists in the mainstream, but fails to be discussed in the course unless individual TFs decide to mention different economic frameworks. Instead, neoclassical economic theories are posited as objective, universally true laws when they are not, while a wide variety of factors that influence economic behavior and phenomena are overlooked and discounted as economic systems and interactions are misleadingly oversimplified. It is reasonable that an introductory course simplifies material to build a foundational understanding upon which students can acquire more knowledge. But it is problematic when this simplification bends a particular way, implicitly and explicitly endorsing notions as objectively accurate when contradictory theories and interpretations exist in the mainstream.
When a course has nearly 700 students, when a course itself is a prerequisite to declare a notable number of concentrations, and when a course teaches principles and theories that will be the only exposure to economics many students will ever have, there is an increased degree of responsibility on the part of the course head to ensure students recognize the breadth of perspectives, interpretations, and critiques that exist in the discipline. A guest lecture about once every month, or four times a semester by Mankiw himself (discounting the two basic introductory presentations on the course during shopping week) is not nearly enough to expose students to different economic frameworks and perspectives, especially when lectures are loosely tied to section curriculum and offer limited insights on viewing economic phenomena differently. Guest lectures certainly help to make economic concepts taught in section less abstract, but they do not change the fact that the section material — based on Mankiw’s textbook — is oversimplified with a partisan bent. A plurality of perspectives and critiques of the main framework used to teach concepts in Ec 10 needs to be integrated into the curriculum in some form or another, or at the very least recognized and discussed in sections.
Ec 10 may be one of the most popular courses on campus, but that is in spite of its flaws. The course, as it is, poses significant and unfair financial barriers to many students, and teaches an inadequate, limited framework that misleadingly oversimplifies economic theories and concepts. If Harvard truly wants to foster the next generation of diverse, critical thinkers, Ec 10 needs to change.

Amid Harvard’s dismissal of calls for fossil fuel divestment, Harvard Management Company — the group that oversees the University’s $39.2 billion endowment — has been one of the lead investors in a methane emissions reduction working group started in 2017.
The working group operates within Principles for Responsible Investment, a United Nations-recognized network of investors that facilitate “responsible investments,” according to its website. The working group specifically encourages companies to manage, report, and reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas and pollutant released during natural gas production and usage.
The working group featured external reviewers including investment firm Vanguard and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, as well as investment participants like oil and gas companies ExxonMobil and Occidental.
HMC joined the working group as part of its sustainable investment policies, according to HMC spokesperson Patrick McKiernan.
“Collaborative engagements are a key component of HMC’s approach to sustainable investment,” McKiernan wrote. “As a PRI signatory, HMC seeks to identify engagement opportunities, sponsored by the PRI or others, that support Harvard University’s interest in climate change initiatives.”
The work group aims to help other companies and investors better understand methane risk exposure, reduce methane emissions, and disclose progress, according to McKiernan. It has already identified and sent letters to 42 companies regarding methane emissions.
Last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow reiterated his opposition to fossil fuel divestment, arguing as his predecessors have for years that Harvard’s endowment should not be used “as an instrument of social policy.” The University does, however, plan to operate fossil-fuel free by 2050.
The Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, a body composed of Harvard faculty, students, and alumni that determines how the University votes in investment shareholder elections, noted HMC’s participation in the working group in its annual report released earlier this month. The ASCR voted in favor of proposals calling on Chevron and Berkshire Hathaway to review and report on methane emissions resulting from their activities.
“It was noted as well that Harvard Management Company has been a lead participant in the engagement of a working group, under the auspices of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) with ExxonMobil and Occidental on methane emissions reduction and that ExxonMobil has issued a detailed report on its methane emissions,” the committee wrote of their decision to support the methane-related proposals.

​​​​​​
Undergraduate Council President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 said they plan to restructure the Council's committee system this year, a move that would require changing its bylaws.
UC committees largely decide how projects are assigned and completed. Palaniappan and Huesa’s proposal reevaluates which committees exist, as well as their purposes and goals. They will propose this effort at the first general UC meeting of the year on Sunday.
“There are several elements we’re tackling, some of which have been kind of ingrained in the Constitution since the UC was created over 40 years ago,” Palaniappan said. “These are pretty significant changes that could occur if we are able to get this proposal passed through the Council.”
Over winter break, Palaniappan and Huesa worked on assembling their executive cabinet, which includes some 14 “project managers” who will work on initiatives assigned by the duo, according to Palaniappan. Former UC President Catherine L. Zhang '19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher '19 were the first to appoint an executive cabinet for the UC.
“Laying that groundwork over the past month is going to set us up to be super effective throughout the course of the coming semester and coming year, so we are excited about the individuals who will be serving in those roles,” Palaniappan said.
Palaniappan and Huesa said they will also prioritize working to retain shopping week during their tenure on the Council. Shopping week allows students to attend courses before formally enrolling at the beginning of each semester. In recent months, the College administration formed a committee to explore alternative options to shopping week, a decision which received pushback from the student body.
Palaniappan said she believes the student response to the Council’s shopping week survey, which garnered over 1,800 student responses, signaled its importance to the Office of Undergraduate Education.
“It’s probably the topic that students most care about on campus right now, especially with all of the discussions that the Office of Undergraduate Education held in the past semester,” Palaniappan said.
The duo said they were cognizant of many students’ frustration with the Council in recent years, something they hope to remedy this year.
“This issue that we saw come up persistently from students during our campaign season, as well, was that a lot of students are dissatisfied with the way that the UC works,” Huesa said. “I think, to an extent, we are also dissatisfied.”
Palaniappan and Heusa said they also plan to appoint a “Director of Belonging and Inclusion,” a new position on the Council, to advocate for underrepresented communities on campus.
“We want to really be intentional about the way that we’re including them into our conversations and into the direct projects that we are working on,” Palaniappan said.
They also said they would work to strengthen UC caucuses — identity groups for Council members — to better serve as outreach mechanisms to the groups and students they support. When the caucuses were first created in 2017, some Council members said that caucuses would add “complex bureaucracy” to the College’s student government.
“We’ll be ensuring that the caucus system is going to be in full swing this semester because the leadership structures within those were just determined this past semester,” Palaniappan said. “This semester will really be the proving ground to see that through.”
Working from a UC office packed with boxes of past Council records that have never been indexed, Palaniappan said she hopes weekly reports from members to their committee chairs will allow the Council to keep track of current and completed projects, in addition to creating a written record of the Council’s work.
“Another major issue we’ve seen on the Council is institutional memory is not good,” Palaniappan said.
Correction: Feb. 5, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that UC leaders appoint Council members to cabinet positions every year. In fact, Zhang and Boucher were the first to appoint an executive cabinet.

College students trudged along Harvard’s salt-stained paths back to academic buildings Monday morning on the first day of the spring semester.
Throughout the day, students had to contend with overflowing classrooms and the sudden malfunctioning of “my.harvard,” the website that houses Harvard’s course catalog and registration system, Monday afternoon.
Students said many classes including Ethical Reasoning 42: “Sex and Ethical Reasoning,” Linguistics 106: “Knowledge of Meaning,” and U.S.-World 43: “Ancestry” were filled to the brim in their respective classrooms.
Christopher Ong ’22, who attended Linguistics 106, said he did not expect so many students to show up at the course’s first meeting. All 40 desks in Boylston 105, the classroom in which the course took place, were filled, and about another 30 students were seated on the floor.
“Even more students wanted to come but couldn’t get into the door,” Ong said. “I think it probably has to do with the fact that this class is structured in a way that’s designed to be very open to beginners.”
Some professors said they plan to adjust their course plans due to unexpectedly high turnout. Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, who teaches U.S.-World 43, decided to move the class’s next meeting on Wednesday from Harvard Hall 104 to the larger Emerson 105 classroom.
“As a Harvard College alum I know first hand the benefits of shopping period, especially when it comes to discovering classes you hadn’t thought of taking before,” Jasanoff wrote in an email. “But what happened in USW 43 today is a good example of how shopping period can also interfere with the student experience by adding congestion, confusion, and uncertainty to the start of the semester.”
Shopping period, the first week of each semester which allows students to try out courses before officially enrolling, has recently come under fire after graduate students and instructors criticized the difficulties it poses for course planning. Last semester, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh tasked a faculty committee with exploring alternatives to shopping week.
Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics” was yet another class that faced an unexpected degree of popularity. Five minutes past its 10:30 a.m. start time, the line to enter the class in Science Center Hall B still extended to the middle of the Science Center lobby.
Thaddeus J. Kennedy ’21, who waited in the line to enter, said he has looked forward to taking the course “for a while.”
“I thought I was just going to be able to go right in. This line is the biggest line I have ever seen for a course,” Kennedy said while inching forward in the queue.
Sometime Monday afternoon, students began experiencing difficulties logging into their my.harvard online accounts. Marissa G. Sumathipala ’22 said she was frustrated with the mass outage.
“My.harvard not working prevented me from sectioning in my class, which was annoying,” Sumathipala said.
Ong also experienced technical difficulties when attempting to check the syllabi of his courses but said he was able to work through the outage.
“It wasn’t too bad. I spent the last few days figuring out most of my stuff, so I was able to ask around through other people,” Ong said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard University Information Technology is working to resolve the my.harvard malfunction. As of Monday evening, functionality had returned for many students.
“HUIT was alerted to an outage with the my.harvard system and took steps to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,” Swain wrote. “We are continuing to monitor the system and recognize the impact the outage may have had on students.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke emailed students Monday evening announcing FAS had extended the deadline for the check-in process — which requires students to update their personal information and read University documents — to 11.59 p.m. Tuesday due to issues with my.harvard. Students previously faced a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Monday and a fine if they did not check-in on time.
Several undergraduates said they are looking forward to beginning classes this week despite these challenges.
“We had a really long break,” Kennedy said. “I’m just excited to get after it.”

Five international students who research nonviolent solutions to political conflict have been named to the Harvard Kennedy School’s first class of Topol Research Fellows, the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy announced Monday.
Carr Center Faculty Director Mathias Risse said in a press release that the newly appointed research fellows will bring a "powerful new lens” to human rights research at the Kennedy School. The fellows — current Kennedy School students — will receive funding to support a year’s worth of research as part of the program.
“The goal is to select a group of HKS students working on nonviolence as an approach to solving many complex and pressing problems and provide them support, peer learning, and faculty leadership,” Risse wrote in an email Monday.
Topol fellows Amanat Boparai, Víctor Pérez García, Rahaf Safi, Preeti Sahai, and Sofia Salas will attend classes led by Kennedy School Professor Erica Chenoweth, who studies political violence and its alternatives.
“We’ll meet a few times over the semester to talk about their own research and review other recent research on nonviolent resistance and its effectiveness and its limits,” Chenoweth said.
Chenoweth said the inaugural group of fellows will study a broad range of cases of nonviolent resistance.
“We were able to provide support to five different Kennedy School students who will be conducting research on various topics,” she said.
The fellows’ projects explore women’s roles in nonviolent movements, peaceful resistance in Syria, solutions to Catalonian conflict, approaches to political polarization in India, and nonviolent protests in Colombia.
“All of their projects are unique,” Chenoweth said. “I’m excited to work with every one of our fellows.”
Risse said he hopes the students will benefit from collaborative opportunities with Chenoweth and other Carr Center affiliates.
Risse wrote in his email that one of the goals of the fellowship is to “help students to develop a more robust, evidence based and comprehensive proposal that they can take with them once they leave the Kennedy School.”
The fellowship program is funded by philanthropist Sidney Topol, a telecommunications magnate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Cambridge residents spoke out in favor of a moratorium on cutting down trees at a City Council meeting Monday, prompting an hours-long debate between councillors.
The Council ultimately voted to delay the passage of the moratorium and allow time for more public input.
The proposal would stop granting permits to cut down trees for one year — except under special circumstances — and levy a substantial fine on violators. The resolution cited both the overwhelming public sentiment in favor of a moratorium from a previous public forum and “an urgent need to stop tree canopy loss in Cambridge.”
According to the Urban Forest Master Plan Task Force — formed by the Council in June 2018 — the Cambridge tree canopy fell from 30.8 percent in 2009 to 25.3 percent in 2018, an average net loss of 31 acres per year.
Cambridge residents gave passionate and emotionally charged testimonials in favor of the proposal. Many cited personal anecdotes regarding the loss of trees near their homes.
Shane H. Brodie, a student at the Harvard Divinity School, said he was “horrified” about the removal of 11 mature trees along a public parkland at Alewife Reservation.
“They knew they were doing something wrong when they did this,” Brodie said.
The Divinity School has faced its own controversy about felling trees in recent months after students protested the school's plans to cut down a mature tree on its grounds as part of renovations set for summer 2019.
Despite the public push in favor of the proposal, City Councillor Alanna M. Mallon contested that those present at the City Council meeting may not represent Cambridge as a whole.
“Yes, there are a lot of people here tonight speaking in support of it, but I will say that the majority of Cambridge does not know that this is going on,” she said.
Proponents of the moratorium argued that delaying the proposal would give residents an opportunity to cut down more trees before the suspension is adopted. Councillor Quinton Y. Zondervan stressed the importance of immediate action. He said a lengthy delay would prove harmful to tree canopy conservation efforts and argued that “there is quite a bit of knowledge out there on this issue.”
While several councillors advocated the need for a moratorium, others, including Mayor Marc C. McGovern, pointed out that an immediate enforcement would limit public debate.
“We cannot deny people the opportunity to have a chance for input. We wouldn’t stand for it,” McGovern said.
Councillor Craig A. Kelley also voiced his disapproval of a moratorium, saying it would hurt residents who could unknowingly violate the ordinance.
Mayor McGovern and councillors Denise Simmons, Kelley, Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., and Mallon voted for the motion to delay and send the proposal back to the Ordinance Committee, while Vice Mayor Jan Devereux and Councillors Dennis J. Carlone, Sumbul Siddiqui, and Zondervan voted against it.

With Harvard debuting Syllabus Explorer and Curricle beta, it’s clear that students and administration are seeking an alternative to the Course Search function on my.Harvard (it may work, but it is definitely in need of some updates).
While Syllabus Explorer can be helpful in choosing courses, Curricle is downright weird. But not to fear, for there’s a better solution out there. A student-made course-finder called QGuide+ is very simple, but devastatingly effective. It goes through the most recent QGuide data on a course, and allows you to filter courses by workload and overall Q rating after you’ve typed in a few keywords. If you’ve ever wished you could just search the Q guide instead of the course catalog, this is what you’ve been waiting for.
This, as many of you may now be thinking, makes it really easy to find easier courses — also known as gems. Jack. Freaking. Pot. In fact, QGuide+ prides itself on being the “Best Gem Finder.” If you have a tough workload and are looking for a more relaxed fourth class, rest assured that finding a gem is much easier with this tool. Other features on the site allow you to filter by the number of Q evaluations a course has received and the general education requirement(s) a course fulfills.
Creators Benny Chang ’22 and Blake D. Young ’22 say that the project started over J-term when Young “was thinking about what classes to take.” First, Chang and Young worked on collecting the data that was necessary for several weeks. Then it was time to build the website. Seemingly surprised by how quickly they put the whole thing together, Chang chuckled and said that they had created the entire website “probably within the past week.”
“We just figured it was something people wanted, and we did it,” said Chang.
The project started out as an extension of CS50, which both Chang and Young took in the fall.
Young said, “We both took CS50, and that basically taught me some tools necessary to learn the basics of Python. From that I built a chess bot.” From there, Young wanted to do some more “practical things.” Hence, a course search website with filters that Harvard students actually care about (like workload and Q rating). David Malan, if you’re reading this, just look at the wonders that CS50 can do.

Head to the QGuide+ and happy course searching!
