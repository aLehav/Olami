After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Why jazz? Wynton Marsalis’ answer is simple: “Because it’s the national art.” For him, jazz is perfectly suited by its history and its structure to be morphed and meatphorized as an expression of the American identity. His words and his music convey this conviction, a conviction that is very much a part of his own identity. One need only listen to him for a few minutes to be completely won over by the passionate poeticism and swinging tones that infiltrate even his speaking. He is, as University President Drew Faust said when she was introducing him, “an infectious and energetic advocate for the arts.” And so it was on April 29. “Music as Metaphor,” first of six scheduled performance lectures to be given by Marsalis over the next two years, moved a packed Sanders Theatre by its end to a standing ovation—both for his skill as an orator and a musician as well as for the art form itself, renewed in its relevance in the minds of the audience. His message was as powerful as his delivery impeccable: “This music [jazz] cost us a lot. Not knowing what it means costs more.”
The story of his ties with Harvard began with Faust and Marsalis’ acquaintance when he received his honorary doctorate in music in 2009. “President Faust had been talking to Wynton Marsalis and he wanted to do something with Harvard,” recalled Ingrid Monson, Quincy Jones Professor of African-American Music. “She asked him to write a proposal, and asked me what I thought of it. I thought it was a wonderful idea. That was a while back.” After much preparation, Marsalis’ thoughts began to take form, and the final product was a performance-lecture series that will span the course of two years. “One of them will be on New Orleans, another on the blues, and one will be about big band and jazz composition,” said Monson. The lecture in the fall will be about jazz and dance.
While the variety of topics covered and the series’ capitalization on Marsalis’ specialty is reminiscent of Harvard’s famed Norton lecture series, the University has added an element apart from the performance aspect to his involvement that will set it apart from what has come before them. “It follows in the tradition of Norton lecture series given throughout the past by Igor Stavinsky, Aaron Copland, and Leonard Bernstein,” wrote Associate Provost for Art and Culture Lori Gross in an email. “That said, Marsalis’ engagement with the University will be something very different from the Norton series. Apart from lectures, Marsalis will be interacting with students and the community at a very grassroots level.” During his visit on the weekend of April 29, Marsalis hosted a master class for high school and Harvard musicians at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.
These students who had the opportunity to interact with Marsalis during his visit were in the company of an extremely accomplished musician, and many others will learn from him in the next two years. Indeed, Marsalis can really play. “He can do anything on the instrument. He is possibly the most skilled person you could imagine on an instrument,” said Monson. “He is incredibly virtuosic.” During “Music and Metaphor” he employed extended techniques on the trumpet ranging from growling, microtones, and several different vibrato effects. Ever the versatile musician, he showed off his vocal talents, singing a smooth and lethargically mournful rendition of blues standard “Baby, Will You Please Come Home.” Even his whistling was clear, flourished, and completely in tune.
As for his lecture, Marsalis flexed his interpretive muscle, using jazz as a metaphor for the American identity. “Every metaphor has its insights that it offers for interpretation,” said Monson. Marsalis touched on the aspects of jazz—its interactivity between a soloist and the ensemble, it’s history embedded in roots of protest and change, the collaborative birth of the art form—and related them in a way that magnified its utility as a tool to understand who the American is. “Americans are unpredictable; American musicians syncopate,” said Marsalis.
He spoke of the oppression of the people in America’s history, and the way the people had to struggle. For Marsalis, the birth of the blues was a victory that set Americans on their way. “The only win is the one that satisfies a deep truth,” Marsalis said. As a teacher and a musician, Marsalis makes it his mission to spread the good news. Over the next two years, with Marsalis’ help, the Harvard community will delve into its repercussions still visible in what America is today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, my brother and I had lunch with twins from our hometown who had recently been accepted to Harvard but had other offers on the table. For an hour and a half we sat in Quincy dining hall giving them the good, the bad, and the ugly about life at Harvard. The need to distill four years into a conversation over tater-tots was a refreshingly introspective one. It allowed me to recognize how the institution has changed over the past four years, which reminded me that places like Harvard are in constant flux. They go through cycles of personalities, attitudes, and priorities. So, this column, my final one, will serve as the epilogue to that discussion in Quincy dining hall, a forward-looking stab at what I believe will be the most pressing student life issues in the coming four years.
The Office of Student Life has followed a clear trajectory since the 2009 departure of Dean of Student Life Judith Kidd. Limiting the College’s liability seems to be the ultimate goal in student life policing (programming is too generous of a term), even when it comes at the expense of common sense, fun, and fairness. The decision to eliminate hard alcohol at off-campus house formals, for example, is as paternalistic as it is misguided and as infantilizing as it is ineffective. When did it become the OSL’s job to monitor the type of alcohol consumed by of-age students at an event they paid as much as $30 to attend? The OSL seems increasingly unable to recognize that each move to limit drinking in public, monitored settings where students are interacting with tutors, faculty, and House staff, pushes students further into the recesses of their rooms and off-campus locations where pre-gaming and dangerous drinking decisions become the norm. Tensions will escalate between attempts to standardize alcohol policies across campus and students’ abilities to make their own decisions.
Next, look at the unfair and uneven application of the College’s amnesty policy to extracurricular groups and their leaders. The OSL simultaneously relies on student groups to power social life—in their eyes, a preferable alternative to final clubs–and forces those groups’ leaders to live in constant fear of being put in front of the Administrative Board when an already intoxicated student ends up at UHS after passing through their parties. The amnesty policy becomes more about assigning blame than putting safety first. Blame is removed from students who are unable to make safe drinking decisions on their own behalf and transferred to extracurricular leaders, who spend every party obsessing over whether drunk students present are going to get them into trouble. This incentivizes exclusive and invite-based extracurricular parties that make group membership a prerequisite for attendance, significantly limiting students’ options. I foresee a growing inability of extracurricular groups to serve as social hubs because the OSL’s conflicting desire to have student group leaders simultaneously create social life and accept all liability for the many students who, for better or worse, do choose to drink.
A lot of talk across campus centers on the prominence of purely social organizations, such as final clubs, at Harvard. But these discussions overlook the increasing intersection of social life and service, ethnic, or pre-professional groups. From PBHA programs to publications, involvement often entails parties, pre-games, and happy hours. While mixing work and play is not necessarily a problem, the OSL will face challenges in policing a growing number of extracurricular groups that use evening events to build community and camaraderie. Still, these groups will not meet demand for social life on campus: I predict a growing sorority network that will become more difficult for the Administration to recognize. I also hope for increased collaboration in the form of standardized rush policies between the male fraternities that, this year, received a record number of rushes.
Yet these observations, which seem to be by now widely acknowledged by everyone except the out-of-touch OSL, point to a broader shift in campus atmosphere that is cause for concern. An atmosphere of negativity, foreboding, and pessimism surrounds social life at Harvard. There is a pervasive feeling that the demands of students fall on deaf ears. Traditions are dismantled and choices limited, but we are given nothing in return, no replacements, and no alternatives. Among student group leaders there is a certain degree anxiety, among final club members a significant amount of defensiveness, and, among others, a palpable sense of frustration.
Still, when my brother and I spoke to those prospective students, I could not help trying to sell Harvard. Despite these warnings of future conflict, I maintain a strong conviction that this school can be great. In August, both twins will move into the Yard. Their Harvard experience will be different than mine has been, in large part because their Harvard will be four years down the road when they start. I simply hope that this column and the five that have preceded it serve as much-needed primers in realities of student life for the Administration, and add a student voice to the debate on important decisions. Only when these issues remain in the community discourse, when students are willing to advocate for preservation of the things that made their Harvard careers great, can the University change for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Provost of Stanford University, Condoleezza Rice was an intellectual figurehead for a large, research university much like ours. She balanced the budget, was a courtside staple at Cardinal basketball games, and forcefully articulated a vision for a multicultural humanities education for undergraduates. President Faust’s new provost, Alan M. Garber ’76, was a tenured professor throughout Rice’s term as provost at Stanford, and thus had a prime seat from which to watch a charismatic leader at work. This is a lucky coincidence, for given the evolution of the provost’s job over the past 19 years, Harvard is more in need of a Stanford-style provost than ever.
One of Faust’s long-term objectives is to unite Harvard’s disparate academic divisions and create stronger University-wide ties. To this end, she needs a strong provost, because diffusing the managerial responsibilities of the president and overseeing University academics was the reason the position was created. As former President Neil L. Rudenstine told The Crimson in 1991, “the main job would be to try to see how one could stitch together the pieces, how to get the whole to operate more collaboratively as a whole across schools.” The provost ensures that the University is greater than the sum of its parts.
Unfortunately, for the past two decades, the job has lacked a clear definition, and has primarily entailed being the ad hoc manager of individual academic initiatives. The first two provosts lasted for little more than two years each. The third, Harvey V. Fineberg ’67, served mainly as an informal advisor to Rudenstine, and resigned when Larry Summers was named president. Steven E. Hyman, the outgoing provost, has significantly expanded the role. He played a central role in planning the erstwhile Allston Science Complex, and nearly doubled the administrative size of the office.
Yet it seems clear that none of the previous provosts have been able to bring the job to its necessary dimensions. At a research university of Harvard’s scope, it is essential for the provost to do more than effect projects the president is too busy to deal with personally. While a close and complementary relationship with the president is necessary—and Garber’s background in the sciences and social sciences seems a good fit for Faust’s background in the humanities—the provost must be a strong presence on campus, independent of the president.
As the academic head of the University’s schools, the provost has a great opportunity to articulate an intellectual vision for the University. To this end, we hope Garber publicly declares his mission and goals early in his tenure. As hard as weaving together schools with as diverse an ethos, student body, and professional purpose as Harvard’s will be, it is essential for the provost not to shy away from generalizing the University’s academic mission to the extent necessary, in order for the term “University” to mean something more than a shared central phonebook.
When considering these goals, we hope that Garber will focus his energies on fostering an interdisciplinary atmosphere at Harvard. The University is already headed in this direction, with the rise in prominence of initiatives such as the Harvard Institute for Global Health and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. However, there is a strong need for an academic environment on this campus that better synthesizes the expertise of all academic divisions. To aid in cross-school collaboration throughout the academic hierarchy, there should, for instance, be an established protocol available for helping community members set up and undertake interdisciplinary initiatives. Garber should compel community members in various branches of the university to undertake interdisciplinary initiatives to utilize Harvard's intellectual breadth. Indeed, as the longtime director of Stanford’s Center for Health Policy, Garber has done just that, and we trust he will do the same in his role here.
As the first provost with extensive administrative experience at another university, Garber promises to set a new tone for this young office. We hope he brings from California instincts for compromise and academic conviction. Now more than ever, Harvard needs a strong provost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Luis Fortuño, the governor of Puerto  Rico, announced a few days ago that the island would hold a series of referendums to determine its political future, most people rolled their eyes. Given that Puerto Ricans have repeatedly—and inconclusively—voted on their status within the United   States, it is easy to see why many believe that the governor’s efforts are doomed to failure. However, there is hope to believe that this time around Puerto Ricans will fully embrace the Stars and Stripes, and elect to become the 51st state of the union.
Currently, Puerto Rico falls under the category of “commonwealth,” a word that is basically a euphemism for “colony.” Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens at birth, but islanders are not allowed to vote for president, and do not have a voting representative before Congress. Since they have fought in every U.S. war since 1917, but do not have a say in choosing their Commander-in-Chief, it might seem only logical that Puerto Ricans would have long ago opted for statehood. So why have they not done so?
The foremost reason why some in Puerto Rico like being a commonwealth is that the island has low taxes. Although they are subject to payroll taxes, most Puerto Ricans do not need to pay an income tax. There is thus a considerable financial incentive to maintain the status quo. However, lower taxes are not compensation for fewer political rights. Although Puerto Ricans enjoy considerable political autonomy, and are able to elect their own governor and legislature much like any state, they are still subject to a greater authority whose decisions they have no influence in molding. The residents of the island are effectively second-class citizens—a fact that has no monetary compensation.
Some in Puerto  Rico also feel that the unique political status of the island allows for a degree of remarkable cultural freedom. Perhaps because they are not formally a part of the United States, Puerto Ricans feel no need to conform to its prevalent cultural norms. For instance, they speak primarily Spanish rather than English, a situation some fear could change if the island joined the union. But who says that the predominant language of a state has to be English? The Constitution doesn’t even mention having an official language, let alone specify it. It is hard to see why there should be a relationship between the way Puerto Ricans communicate with each other and the legal status they possess.
But the argument that Puerto Rico is too culturally distinct from the 50 current states to ever join them extends beyond simply language. Some islanders fear that a switch from commonwealth to statehood would also entail a switch from reggaeton to rock, and from the traditional rice and beans to hamburgers. This belief is not only one that has no foundation; it is one that ignores the nature of the United States as a nation. Those who claim that Puerto Rico is not culturally compatible with the United States forget that culture is not a fixed set of norms and traits, but rather an entity that evolves dynamically over time, often for the better. Rather than fearing that statehood would mean importing culture from the outside, they should see it as an opportunity to export what makes Puerto Rico unique to the rest of the United States. There is no reason why Puerto Ricans should not be able to both proudly hold on to their customs and enjoy the same rights to which other citizens are entitled.
In two years’ time, the United States could see a new star rise on its flag. The first step in the process is up to Puerto Ricans themselves, but all citizens of the fifty states should actively encourage statehood for the island. In a country where children are taught from a young age that they belong to a “melting pot,” the cultural distinctiveness of Puerto Ricans would add a little more Latin salsa to the mix.

Students of American history often learn that Americans’ voting rights expanded with the growth of the nation. However, as Harvard professor Alexander Keyssar ’69 emphasizes in his book, The Right to Vote, practical voting access has not expanded as consistently. Though African Americans and women famously won the right to vote through constitutional amendments, local and state policies often deprived these and other groups of the franchise through more oblique avenues. “Justified as measures to eliminate corruption or produce a more competent electorate,” Keyssar explains, states and localities imposed literacy tests, lengthened residency periods, and complicated voter registration procedures. The practical goal and effect of such measures, Keyssar notes, was to “purify” the electorate, drastically reducing the voting participation of poor, uneducated, immigrant and–particularly in the South–black voters.
Throughout US history, fears about voter fraud and competency have justified policies that aimed at the systematic disenfranchisement of demographic groups considered unworthy to vote. This year, once again, concerns about voter fraud have emerged to restrict voting rights. This year alone, more than 30 state legislatures have considered new laws which would introduce new barriers to entry for voting. These laws, at various stages in different legislatures, would disproportionately affect poor, elderly, student, and minority voters. Although the precise measures being considered vary from state to state, most proposed laws would invalidate currently accepted forms of voter identification. Under these laws, even current voters would be forced to acquire less accessible identification documents. In North Carolina, an estimated one million voters would be disenfranchised based on the documents they currently have.
The forms of identification which would remain acceptable under these new laws are not equally accessible to all groups within the voting public. Many take significant time, money, or travel to acquire resources that are not distributed evenly across all Americans and would systematically pose higher barriers to entry for certain groups. For example, 2006 nationwide study found that 78 percent of African-American males 18 to 24 lacked a valid driver’s license. The same survey concluded that voting age citizens earning less than $35,000 in annual income were more than twice as likely to lack a government-issued ID that those in higher income brackets.
Some provisions of these laws would also require college students who choose to vote in the state where they attend school to register for additional state identification. College-issued student identification would no longer suffice as proof of residency or personal identification. In some states, college students whose place of residence changes from year-to-year would have to obtain new documentation at each move. Students who attend school out-of-state would be forced to choose, in such cases, between being licensed to drive in their place of birth, or being able to vote in their place of residence
Today, as in earlier times when the politically powerful sought to restrict suffrage, voter fraud is the most frequently cited reason for heightened voting requirements and restrictions. While we strongly believe that basic election regulations should be in place, recent studies have found voter fraud to be virtually non-existent in the United States. In 2002, for example, the Bush administration launched a five-year Justice Department investigation into voter fraud. By the study’s completion in 2007 the administration found no evidence of any organized efforts to skew federal voting in elections. On the other hand, restrictions that systematically make it harder for specific groups to vote would skew election results. The more that states restrict the pool of active voters, the less representative our government will be.
Although Massachusetts is not one of the many states considering new restriction on the franchise, we have an obligation to stay informed and advocate for the rights of our peers in other states. Please consider looking into the specific situation in your home state, spread the word, and add your name to our petition to state legislators across America urging them to oppose further, restrictive voting requirements.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Update 6:05 a.m. | President Barack Obama announced last night that United States forces killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, yesterday, news that sent a jubilant crowd of some 200 students into Harvard Yard, waving American flags and chanting “U.S.A, U.S.A!”
But professors cautioned that bin Laden’s death may be a symbolic victory and could result in retaliation.
The operation, which was a “surgical raid” by a small team designed to minimize collateral damage, killed bin Laden at his hide-out yesterday, according to senior administration officials.
The team was in the compound for less than forty minutes, senior administration officials said, and killed bin Laden in a firefight.
Bin Laden was reportedly buried at sea and in accordance with Islamic practice last night.
“The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al Qaeda,” Obama said.
‘A HISTORIC EVENT’
Emma Notis-McConarty ’11 sat on the sidewalk on the corner of Grant and DeWolfe Streets, listening as a student blasted the President’s statement through a window in the DeWolfe Street apartments. A few other students paused underneath the window to hear the President’s speech—continuing to walk as soon as the President concluded with a phrase from the pledge of allegiance—“one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”
Earlier last night, news of bin Laden’s death swept like wildfire across campus.
Dan J. Giles ’13 and Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson Arts editor, stood in a Quincy common room in bright costumes as the Alice in Wonderland characters White Rabbit and Mad Hatter, respectively.
They said they were on their way to the themed Adams House formal, but when they heard the news, watching the statement seemed to them to be more important.
“Formals come and go, but this is a historic event,” McTaggart said. “I don’t want to say I went to a formal instead of hearing what the President had to say.”
A Boston resident, Notis-McConarty said members of her community were on the planes that left from Boston Logan Airport and crashed into the World Trade Center. She said that the American public has been “detached” from the war in the 10 years following the attacks and hoped bin Laden’s death would remind people to reflect on September 11.
Many students said they first heard about bin Laden’s over email, text, and Facebook.
“Facebook exploded,” Harry A. Chiel ’14 said.
Chiel was one of more than 200 students—mostly freshmen—who filled Harvard Yard after the President’s speech to celebrate.
Not all students thought the celebration was appropriate, however.
“I don’t think anyone’s death is anything to celebrate,” Dawn J. Mackey ’11 said, explaining that she thought the celebration turned bin Laden’s death into a joke.
“Even though he was the enemy, all deaths are a tragedy. It’s more appropriate to honor and remember the lives of the [soldiers and civilians] whose lives were lost.”
Edward Escalon ’14, who also attended the Yard celebration, said he was surprised with Harvard students’ display of patriotism.
“My stepdad’s done a few tours to Iraq,” Escalaon said. “I hate to say ‘Oh my god it’s over,” but at least part of it is over. It’s very inspiring,” he said. “I didn’t think Harvard students were patriotic.”
Brendan P. Hanrahan ’14, a player on the Rugby team, said he heard the news on the bus ride home from a win against the College of Buffalo that guaranteed them a spot in the national championship for the first time in years.
“The already ecstatic atmosphere turned into bedlam,” Hanrahan said. “Does it get any better than that?”
LOOKING FORWARD
Since the September 11 attacks, bin Laden has come to represent the face of anti-American extremism.
Kennedy School assistant professor Tarek Masoud, a Middle East expert, said that his death could have both positive and negative repercussions for the U.S.
If bin Laden was still the operational leader of al Qaeda, his death will have significant implications for the future of that organization.
“Obviously, killing bin Laden decapitates al Qaeda and robs it of its operational leader,” he said. But Masoud also cautioned that bin Laden’s position as a fundamentalist leader could lead to a backlash from his supporters.
“It could make a martyr out of Osama bin Laden,” Masoud said. “That’s why I think President Obama was careful not to gloat about this or declare victory. He said the war on terror is ongoing and that we must remain vigilant precisely because this might potentially inspire others to take revenge for what happened.”
Ali Asani ’77, chair of the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department, said bin Laden’s death will do little to mitigate anti-American sentiment.
“Osama was just a symbol of anti-Americanism that is a product of responses to several decades of American foreign policies in the Middle East,” Asani said.
Instead, Asani said he thinks the details of the mission could help determine future U.S.-Pakistani relations. If it turns out that Pakistani intelligence tipped off American forces, he said the relationship may improve.
If not, Pakistan may find itself on the defensive.
“The credibility of the Pakistani government will be questioned because they kept on denying that he was in Pakistan,” Asani said.
Masoud said he does not expect Middle East nations to place a heavy emphasis on bin Laden’s death.
“All of those countries wanted to see him killed or captured as well,” he said. “I’m not sure this will really impact our policy towards the Middle East, especially since that region is undergoing some really dramatic changes,” he said.
Masoud nonetheless praised Obama for distinguishing in his speech between Islamic fundamentalism and the average Muslim.
“I liked the fact that President Obama was saying this because this is not really addressed to American Muslims; this was addressed to Muslims around the world,” Masoud said. “You just want to make sure you’re not framing our killing of Osama bin Laden as a victory against a Muslim freedom fighter or Muslim leader.”
“There will be also a sense of justice among both Muslims and non-Muslims alike,” said Asani, “especially those who have lost family and friends in Al-Qaeda attacks,” Asani said.
Masoud said Americans should reflect on the moment and realize the immediate implications of bin Laden’s death.
“Let’s not lose sight of the fact that this is a very good thing to have happened,” Masoud said. “It’s a very good thing that he was killed and captured and that we never gave up on that ambition and that we were dogged in trying to bring him to justice.”
A PRECISE STRIKE
The firefight that killed bin Laden took place on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a city about 40 miles north of Islamabad.
Three other men—two of bin Laden’s couriers and his adult son—and one woman, were killed in the battle, according to senior administration officials, who added that the woman was used as a shield by male combatants.
No American lives were lost, though a helicopter was grounded due to mechanical failure.
During his statement, Obama said that top U.S. intelligence officials received a tip in the fall of 2010 that bin Laden might be hiding in a compound in Pakistan.
The compound, which was built five years ago in all likelihood to safekeep bin Laden, sits on a relatively large piece of land on the outskirts of the center of Abbottabad.
Surrounded by twelve to eighteen foot walls topped with barbed wire, the gated, isolated compound—lacking television and internet connection—attracted the attention of the American intelligence community.
In addition, officials said, the brothers who owned the compound had no explainable source of wealth.
The U.S. identified one of the brothers as a courier with connections the former number three of Al Qaeda and a mastermind of the September 11 attacks who was captured in 2005.
The courier was also considered to be one of the few couriers trusted by bin Laden, officials said.
A third family residing in the complex matched the size and make-up of the family US officials expected would be living with bin Laden, including his youngest wife.
Given the information at hand, Obama ordered the operation Friday morning. No other countries were notified about the operation, the officials said.

Gordon S. Jones, a businessman and Harvard Business School admissions officer, has been selected as the inaugural director of the Business School’s Innovation Lab in Allston and is set to take up the position on May 9.
Jones said he was “thrilled” to have been tapped as the Innovation Lab’s first director. The I-Lab—a space that will connect University affiliates from across Harvard’s schools to discuss and develop their business plans—is set to open in September.
“This is a chance to further develop entrepreneurship at Harvard,” Jones said. “The University is making a real commitment to resources and facilities to equip entrepreneurs around the University.”
University officials have in the past said that the Innovation Lab would serve as a resource to the Allston community. In a recent interview, Jones emphasized how the lab would benefit the University and said that as director he will ensure that the Innovation Lab will be particularly focused on students.
“My desire is to help as many student entrepreneurs as possible,” Jones said. “And I want to aid student entrepreneurs interested in for-profit ventures but also ones that will make an impact on the world.”
Jones, who is also an adjunct lecturer at Bentley University, has contributed to the development of many commercial products and has served as a consultant to a variety of companies and startups.
“With his extensive background helping undergraduate and graduate students, as well as his work with entrepreneurial ventures and his strong ties to Harvard University, Gordon is a superb choice for this new and important position,” said Joseph B. Lassiter, HBS faculty co-chair of the Harvard Innovation Lab in a press release.
“He has the skills to build relationships between students and local entrepreneurs, create partnerships with area small business organizations, and develop a center of innovation that fully brings to life the spirit of innovation present throughout the wider University and community.”
University officials have said in the past that the Lab—which will occupy the currently vacated 125 Western Ave., a building that housed the radio station WGBH until 2007—will also provide workshops, business coaching, and other educational resources for Allston residents. Jones echoed those statements when asked about the lab’s relationship to the community.
“It’s really important that community engagement happens simultaneous to University activity at the I-Lab itself,” Jones said. “The facility itself will be a resource to the community, where student innovators and entrepreneurs who have an interest in small business can interact with neighborhood small businesses.”
The I-Lab will also offer a coffee shop and a 24/7 public meeting space.
Jones said he looked forward to developing programming at the Innovation Lab.
“It’s like we’re now holding an infant that is going to grow up and be the president some day,” Jones said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has won $100,000 to harness the electrical power generated by microbes in the soil beneath our feet.
The Microbial Fuel Cell, which researchers hope will one day charge cell-phones in regions lacking access to power, is one of 88 projects to win the Grand Challenges Explorations grant through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Harvard’s project is led by Aviva P. Aiden, a SEAS graduate and current student at Harvard Medical School.
The idea first came to Aiden when she was a PhD student at SEAS working to develop a project with students, mostly from Africa, who had personal experience with lack of power.
“We started looking around at energy solutions that would be appropriate for parts of Africa that are off grid,” she said, adding that the phenomenon through which soil microbes generate power had not been worked with before. Her team was ultimately able to power an LED.
The research areas in the GCE program prompted Aiden to consider using these same soil microbes as a source of power for cellphones—a solution that has both economic and health advantages in Africa.
People who are “off the grid” often spend hours walking to neighboring schools and villages and then pay to charge their phones—a combination of costs and opportunity costs that might dissuade families from calling for medical help when it is truly necessary, according to Aiden.
The Gates Foundation recognized Aiden’s project despite the fact that she had not yet tried to power a cellphone—a testament to the GCE program’s desire to support ambitious ideas.
First introduced in 2008, the program has already awarded almost 500 grants and received more than 2,500 applications from nearly 100 countries this year.
Applicants were asked to submit research proposals for projects that would “address persistent health and development challenges” in predetermined research areas—including the eradication of the poliovirus and the application of cellphone technology to solve global health issues—according to a press release from the Gates Foundation.
The application process is open to anyone and requires only a two-page research proposal.
“They’re designed to give people the opportunity to pursue things that are a little bit more novel, a little bit off the beaten track,” Aiden said.
Winning the GCE Grant qualifies Aiden to apply for another $1 million from the Gates Foundation in the future, but the technology itself will eventually prove very inexpensive to assemble, she said.
The necessary microbes are easily found in the soil, and harnessing their power requires little more than a few electrodes, carbon fabric, and window screens.
“You want it to be really inexpensive and really easy to use and maintain,” Aiden said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty, staff and students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences joined SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray for this semester’s All Hands meeting to highlight the renewed emphasis on teaching labs at SEAS as well as goals for future investment across the School.
Growing interest in SEAS—the school has seen steady increase in student interest both at the undergraduate and graduate levels—has paralleled expansion. But Murray said there is still work to be done.
“[We are] still building, working on lab space, [and] suitable infrastructure for enhanced student needs,” she said, adding that the School intends to improve student experience by “filling out” key faculty slots and planning more student-faculty social events.
SEAS has also dedicated considerable resources to improving teaching labs—space for students to fulfill course lab components—and maximizing their use in course curricula, a primary focus of Friday’s meeting.
Anas Chalah, director of instructional laboratories at SEAS, said that teaching labs represent “an exciting educational experience for our students” by allowing them to design solutions to the problems they study in class.
But Chalah noted that the continued efficacy of teaching labs will require greater investment in infrastructure and facilities, a sentiment that was brought up during last spring’s All Hands meeting and echoed again by Murray on Friday.
SEAS currently supports lab components for 50 percent of its courses—a statistic Chalah hopes will double by next year.
Professors of lab-supported courses presented on the work of their students during the second half of the meeting.
Projects included the modeling of structural dynamics of bicycles, hands-on techniques to determine the chemical and physical properties of minerals, and the transmission of music using a laser beam.
“Around SEAS, we’ve got lots of bright students who are really looking for real world problems to get their hands on,” said Conor J. Walsh, a lecturer on engineering sciences.
Faculty members said they supported the continued discussion on teaching labs.
But professors and students alike also acknowledged that teaching labs cannot be SEAS’ only focus.
“Engineering has a ways to go at Harvard before it reaches its full potential,” said Robert W. Brockett, a professor in electrical engineering and computer science at SEAS who was awarded the Capers and Marion McDonald Award for Excellence in Mentoring and Advising at the end of the meeting.
He added that in addition to supporting lab space, SEAS must support its faculty, who have to meet a slew of demands—from being “inspiring teachers” and conducting research to supporting and funding graduate students—he said.
Jared D. Dourdeville ’11, who was awarded the second prize of the afternoon—the Society of American Military Engineers Award—said that labs should be incorporated into the curriculum with care.
“I’d say, honestly, two of the engineering classes I enjoyed the most were ES 50 and ES 51, and a big part of the reason I enjoyed those classes was the lab component,” he said. “There has to be a balance. Engineering is already one of the most, if not the most, rigorous concentrations on campus ... Labs in theory are great but they also do come with that time expense.”
The All-Hands meeting meets biannually in an effort to update the entire SEAS community on developments in and future goals for the School.

On a poster taped to the window of the penthouse in the Student Organization Center at Hilles, one girl had written the phrase, “Not conforming,” next to which she had drawn a heart in pink marker. Her words were one response to the poster’s heading, “I blast through stereotypes by...” which was one of many prompts on the signs that lined the walls of the SOCH yesterday during the Athena Program’s annual conference—“Engender Justice: Act Now!”
During the day-long conference, local high school students attended workshops that focused on empowering women.
Participants attended workshops geared toward encouraging attending college and a session on sex-ed. They also chose electives on topics including women in politics, healthy relationships, and women in leadership.
A culmination of the Athena Program, a PBHA initiative, the conference featured several workshops taught by students enrolled in the program.
During the semester, Harvard undergraduates taught high school students about women’s issues and devoted a portion of their time to planning the conference together.
In one group session, Amanda I. Morejon ’13, a director of the Athena Program, said participants watched a “problematic” video by rap artist Nelly and brainstormed ways to combat sexism.
Jenay A. Israel, a junior at Boston Trinity Academy, said a friend who was leading a workshop encouraged her to attend the conference.
“I leaned about injustice and how I can change it,” Israel said.
This year’s conference is the first that is open to participants of all genders. While only women attended this year’s conference, Morejon said she hoped men would attend in the future.
Israel said her favorite workshop was one called Trans 101, during which the women learned about issues facing the trans community and individuals.
Maya W. Rogers, a junior at Malden High School, said she enjoyed learning about the history of feminism.
“Part of what I want to get from the conference is a stronger feminist identity,” she said.
The day ended with a keynote speech by E. Abim Thomas ’96, deputy chief counsel to Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78.
“I really hope people leave with a sense that gender doesn’t limit you in what you can obtain in life,” Morejon said.

In its final meeting of the semester last night, the Undergraduate Council passed the Harvard University Forum for Change Act (HUFC), which seeks to establish a public forum for interaction between students, the administration, and faculty in order to encourage community engagement at Harvard.
The proposal—which was drafted in response to a perceived lack of facilitated discussion on campus—will now be sent to President Drew G. Faust for approval.
As the proposal currently stands, the HUFC will be formally supported by the University and will meet twice a semester. The forum will include some individuals designated as regular members but will also be open to administrators, faculty, staff, students, and interested alumni.
However, various characteristics of the proposal are subject to change and UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 will continue to meet with the administration through the summer.
“Things such as membership and the name for the forum are still up in the air,” Ebrahim said. “But the substance and the essence that are outlined are hopefully what will we be seeing next year.”
In creating the proposal, the Council looked to peer universities who have undertaken similar initiatives—including Princeton, Brown, and Columbia—and adopted various elements from each, creating a product that UC representatives said would be the best fit for Harvard’s unique decision-making structure.
The most significant way that HUFC will differ from forums at peer institutions is that it will also serve as an organizational tool for students interested in addressing on-campus issues.
“The establishments at other schools are really just a mouth piece for the administration.” Ebrahim said. “That is important, but we also want students, faculty, and those in the constituency to have a forum to voice their concerns because this facilitates actual progress on the issues that students care about.”
But Ebrahim did express apprehension about potential challenges that the forum may face.
“I am worried about physically implementing this meeting,” he said. “We are asking that about 30 of the busiest people on campus meet at one time and take the discussion seriously.”
Several concerns were also expressed within the legislation itself. These included the possibility that the forum would merely serve as a communication channel and not exercise any influence on University decision-making and that the forum will not become institutionalized in a way that will allow it to survive each president’s tenure.
Despite these challenges, the Council remained hopeful for the future of the forum, most notably pointing to its potential to expose top University decision-makers to student voices.
“Ultimately the same people will be making the same decisions, but this gives them a chance to ask students and faculty for their opinions,” said Ebrahim. “So in terms of how the forum gets used, I think it is up to administrators to decide if they want to be proactive.”

As Canadian undergraduates watch the federal election unfold today in their home country, they will see one candidate who is a fellow Harvardian—Michael G. Ignatieff, a 1976 graduate of Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a former professor at the Kennedy School.
Ignatieff is running for prime minister as head of the Canadian Liberal Party and hopes to defeat his Tory rival Stephen Harper, the sitting prime minister.
After his graduation from Harvard, Ignatieff lived primarily in England, working as a professor and journalist and writing several influential pieces on human rights.
He was appointed as director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School in 2000.
“He was outstanding in his qualifications,” said Joseph S. Nye, who was Dean of the Kennedy School at the time. “The things he’s written are the very best.”
Kennedy School Professor Alex Keyssar said that while Ignatieff was widely appreciated and respected at the Kennedy School his tenure was also marked by tensions regarding his political views.
At a time when many Harvard intellectuals opposed the recently-declared Iraq war, including both Nye and Keyssar, Ignatieff stood out as one of the few faculty members in favor of the invasion.
“My recollection was that Ignatieff was the strongest advocate of the war [at the Kennedy School],” Keyssar said.
Ignatieff later changed his opinion about the conflict but after departing from Harvard he published a piece in the New York Times about how Harvard influenced his views on the war.
“He seemed to be suggesting that the Harvard environment encouraged him to support the invasion,” Keyssar said of the piece. “I and a number of people found that surprising.”
When Ignatieff left Harvard for a visiting professorship in Canada in 2005, many speculated that he might launch a political career.
According to Nye, who sat down for a meal with Ignatieff shortly before his departure, his intentions to pursue politics were clear.
“I think he had a feeling this was a chance to do something for his country and that he ought to do it,” Nye said.
Shortly after his departure, Ignatieff announced that he intended to run for Canadian parliament.
During his political career in Canada, Ignatieff’s opponents criticized him for his lack of patriotism, arguing that he had lived abroad for a major part of his life.
Yet Nye said he doesn’t doubt Ignatieff’s patriotism.
“This conversation is rather ironic,” Nye said. “He gave up a very important position at Harvard because he wanted to go back.”
This is Ignatieff’s first run for Canadian prime minister. As of last week, he placed third in the polls, behind Harper and New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton.
Some have speculated he might leave his leadership position if he finishes third today.

The teaching staff of Life Sciences 1b has changed the course’s grading policy as a disciplinary measure for “course-wide cheating” that was reported earlier last week. The staff has reduced the amount of credit for components of the course for which cheating was alleged and increased the weight of the final exam.
Breakouts—questions that are asked during lecture and answered via clickers registered in students’ names—will be worth 1 percent of final grades and in-class quizzes will be worth zero percent.
In an email to all LS1b students, preceptor Casey Roehrig wrote that concerned students brought the possibility of cheating to the attention of the teaching staff.
“While we cannot be certain that cheating occurred, we think that it is likely, particularly given the complaints we received,” Roehrig wrote.
“I think that cheating probably occurred for the in-class quizzes, just because it was so easy to cheat,” said Amy Wann ’14. “I do think they did the right thing by omitting the in-class quizzes, because people definitely were comparing answers.”
Roehrig explained that collaboration during breakouts was encouraged for discussion-based questions only. But some breakouts were meant to test solely the students’ understanding of the material, she wrote.
“Partway through the semester, we became aware that some students had discussed their responses to these clicker questions—either in the classroom or online or both,” Roehrig wrote.
The teaching staff said that they believe that students were using a Facebook group called “Ls1b” to cheat on questions during breakouts and in-class lecture quizzes.
Roehrig wrote that due to the large size of the course the staff relied on the honor system while quizzes were administered.
“I don’t really think it makes that much of a difference. If you honestly did the work in the class there’s no substitute for that,” said Vishal S. Arora ’14, a student in the course. “It does add a little bit more pressure, but if the student has done the work he or she will be fine.”
Robert B. Krabek ’14 agreed and said that the increased weight on the final could benefit those who have not been performing well.
“But I think it’s stupid how they just assume that people were cheating with the LS1b Facebook group,” Krabek said.
The teaching staff, however, believes that the change will not affect students who have not cheated.
“Everyone will have an equal opportunity to demonstrate his or her understanding of the course material on the final exam,” Roehrig wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard sophomore Jane was in kindergarten, she could not communicate with her teacher or classmates. She was only able to speak and read Spanish, and the sole phrase she could express in English was to ask if she could go to the bathroom. As an American citizen growing up with parents who were undocumented immigrants from Mexico, Jane—whose name has been changed to protect her identity—had to learn the English language on her own.
However, unlike many other children whose parents are undocumented, Jane had a valuable resource in her mother, who attended law school in Mexico. Her mother consistently encouraged her and stressed the value of education, allowing Jane to ultimately excel at her academics and gain admission to Harvard.
But in many ways, Jane is the exception.
Hirokazu Yoshikawa, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, conducts research on the effects of growing up as the child of undocumented parents. In his recent book, titled “Immigrants Raising Citizens,” he concludes that these children often show signs of developmental delays due to the additional challenges posed by their parents’ status.
Though the Harvard students with undocumented parents have managed to overcome these education challenges, several of them say that they have seen firsthand how living under the radar can take its toll.
STRUGGLING IN THE SHADOWS
Yoshikawa conducted interviews with Dominican, Mexican, and Chinese immigrant families in New York while writing his book. He found that the children of undocumented immigrants were often outperformed by their peers.
“For quite a few of our families, it looked like, in a variety of ways, being undocumented had effects in lowering their [children’s] cognitive skills and their language skills,” he says.
Yoshikawa cites multiple reasons for this lag, but he said the root cause was the stress of living in the United States under the radar, which meant parents had to work longer and harder with illegally low wages and, in some situations, were afraid to seek out or didn’t know about educational resources.
During Jane’s childhood, she faced many of the difficulties documented by Yoshikawa. Her father labored without the legal protections afforded to U.S. citizens, and her parents were often fearful that their illegal immigrant status would be discovered.
Nonetheless, Jane managed to thrive with the support of her mother.
“She was very interested in my education,” Jane says. “So I feel like that sort of fostered my own interest in learning and made it easy for me to get by, even though I was at this really crappy, large public school.”
But Jane saw firsthand how her classmates—many of whom were also the children of undocumented parents—struggled through their educations.
“I remember back to elementary school, kids reading at 2nd grade levels in 5th and 6th grade,” Jane says. “Since my mom helped out a lot, she would sit with them and try and help them. It’s hard to see. It’s not their fault. It’s not their parents’ fault.”
Jane adds that she also encountered students in her community service work that had parents who acted in the way Yoshikawa observed.
“I’ve encountered a lot of parents who just don’t know how it is they can help their kids, that there are Head Start programs,” she says.
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK
Jane says her mother learned English mainly by helping with her homework.
“She was a very hands-on mom, but I feel like she’s very much the exception in my community,” she said.
Jane’s mother and father, who is now deceased, first arrived in California in the 1980s. They lived near the border for several years before ultimately making the decision to seek a life in the U.S.
During the time, immigration policies were much more relaxed, and Jane said her parents simply drove into California.
In 1986, Congress passed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which made illegal the hiring of undocumented workers but also granted amnesty to seasonal agricultural immigrants and illegal immigrants who had been in the United States prior to 1982. Jane says her father was eligible for these requirements.
“My dad was here for the 1986 amnesty and he started going through the process, but he irresponsibly never finished it,” she says.
Her father’s failure to pursue citizenship ultimately resulted in a difficult economic situation for Jane’s family. He worked in landscaping and gardening, and eventually became self-employed, but his wages were barely enough to support a family of four.
“Work was very uncertain,” Jane says. “It isn’t really a stable occupation.”
Though Jane’s father made a minimal amount of money, her mother nonetheless stayed at home because that was what was expected of her.
However, after her father passed away, Jane says her mother began working full time, and she struggles to invest the same amount of time in raising her younger brother, who is now 10 years old.
“She still tries to sit down with him and work on homework with him, and she wakes up early to go over it,” Jane says. “She still puts in the same amount of effort, it’s just very taxing on her.”
Though he is smart, Jane says she worries about her brother’s future since he now spends time after school with his cousins, who are not as studious as Jane. She goes on to say that, due to their mother’s undocumented status, her brother may not have access to educational resources that could help ensure his academic success.
FEARING THE GOVERNMENT
In his book, Yoshikawa writes, “The undocumented parents in our sample lived this paradox: the very same government that could deport them also offered resources to their citizen children, in the form of public supports for families in poverty.”
Oftentimes, he says, parents do not know about opportunities for their children, or might be reluctant to pursue them for fear of being exposed as an illegal citizen.
“[The families] were avoiding situations where they had to show a lot of paperwork and identify their employers,” Yoshikawa says.
Because children are unable to seek out these opportunities themselves, Yoshikawa writes, parental involvement is vital for their early development.
For Joanna Marquina ’10, whose mother was an undocumented immigrant, it was her father’s conditional residency that allowed her to be involved in these opportunities at a young age.
“We found out about different opportunities that I think my dad was able to push us toward, because he had the advantage of residency,” she says.
Marquina says her father had previously been married to an American but later divorced her and overstayed his visa. Despite the complications, she said his status still allowed him to work and provide for his children.
“We were really dependent on him and took our lead from him,” she said. “He was the one who encouraged us to do well in school and take advantage of different resources within the community like libraries or enrolling us in bilingual preschool.”
When Marquina began excelling in her studies, she said her father was able to go to her teachers and inquire about additional resources.
“Just having the comfort of not being found out makes you feel more comfortable looking for other opportunities and asking certain questions,” she says.
However, Marquina said her cousins and other children she knew were afraid to pursue educational opportunities due to their parents’ undocumented status.
“You don’t really know who was in charge of certain things or if they were going to ask questions dealing with your status or if anything was dependent on your status,” she said.
IMPROVING THE SYSTEM
Though Yoshikawa is an expert in child development, he says his research is relevant to the larger immigration debate. In his opinion, Yoshikawa says the lack of assistance to undocumented parents is a “public failure.” He has testified in front of Congress and appeared on NPR about this research, and says the developmental delays of children who grow up with undocumented parents is an argument for immigration reform.
“If you play by the rules and demonstrate commitment and contribute to the United States, you should have an opportunity to get in line and wait for citizenship,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie condemned his state’s spending on education and teachers’ unions Friday at the Harvard Graduate School of Education as part of the last Askwith Forum of the year.
Christie—who has been criticized for his plans to significantly alter tenure policies and introduce merit pay—said he is not worried that his controversial education initiatives could impede his chances of reelection.
“I could care less,” Christie said to applause. “I won’t be able to sleep at night if I decide to incrementalize and compromise the principles we talked about today just to get myself an extra four years in office. It ain’t worth it.”
His principles, Christie said, include defeating the interests of teachers’ unions, which he likened to “political thuggery.”
“[Teachers’ unions are] an operation that rules through fear and intimidation,” Christie said. “They are there to protect the lowest performers and to protect a system of post-employment compensation.”
Joseph Klein, a graduate student at the Ed School who spent 38 years running his own steel company and interacted with industry unions, said that he agreed with Christie’s outlook on teachers’ unions.
“There are few union leaders who truly want reform and truly are interested in children and children learning rather than keeping their own power,” Klein said.
Among Christie’s plans for reform is an overhaul of the tenure system, requiring teachers to be evaluated annually as either effective or highly effective in order to maintain their tenure. Currently, Christie said teachers may be awarded tenure after three years of teaching without further evaluations. Though he was accused of attacking teachers in his campaigns, Christie said the opposite is true.
“I want to empower teachers,” he said. “I want teachers who understand that they are going to be rewarded for excellence, and that there are consequences for failure.”
Union leaders argue that Christie’s plan to remove tenure and instead implement monetary incentives for better teaching would discourage teachers to collaborate with one another.
“I’m sure at Facebook, given the competition for pay, they no longer collaborate,” he said sarcastically. “It’s ridiculous. Of course they collaborate.... What an awfully cynical, ugly characterization of teachers.”
Christie also argued that the New Jersey state government overspends on education, partially as a result of a state supreme court ruling there.
“In our state, the supreme court makes it up as they go along,” Christie said. “They are the architects of a failed legal theory that money equals quality.”
New Jersey is consistently among the states with the highest income, property, and sales tax rates, Christie said.
But, he said, high spending on education in New Jersey is not producing noticeable benefits.
Despite the fact that some districts spend as much as $33,000 on pupils per year, less than one-third graduate and up to 90 percent of those who continue on to college require remedial courses, Christie said.
“Money is not the answer to this problem,” he said. “New Jersey is the laboratory which proves the failure of that. No one spends more.”
The audience of several hundred responded enthusiastically to Christie’s remarks, and gave him several standing ovations. However, one member of the audience, Ed School student Jennifer L. Hanson, criticized Christie’s incendiary rhetoric and for boasting about his nickname “The Disrupter.”
In response to Hanson’s comment, Christie said he would tone down his rhetoric only after he could find a successful compromise with union leaders.
“You can’t reason at the moment with these folks,” he said. “They’ve gotten their own way, all the time. This fight has to be had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By sweeping Dartmouth in two doubleheaders this weekend, the Harvard softball team clinched its second consecutive North Division crown and gained home-field advantage at next weekend’s Ivy League Championship Series.
The Crimson (34-14, 18-2 Ivy) offense was on fire the entire weekend, scoring a total of 37 runs against the Big Green (17-22, 10-10 Ivy) to earn two comfortable victories.
“We knew we needed only one win to host and to clinch the title,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “But the girls just stayed hungry for all four games and continued to play great.”
“We played so well,” freshman third baseman Kasey Lange added. “This is great for us going into Ivy League Championships next weekend, to get this momentum going.”
HARVARD 10, DARTMOUTH 1
In the final contest of the weekend, Harvard junior pitchers Rachel Brown and Mari Zumbro shut down the Dartmouth offense, holding the Big Green to a single run.
The Crimson took an early 5-1 lead in the bottom of the second off of freshman Shelbi Olson’s two-RBI single to center field, sophomore Stephanie Regan’s RBI single, and Lange’s RBI double.
One inning later, Harvard increased its lead to 8-1 on a Zumbro RBI single to right field and co-captain Ellen Macadam’s single to center, which plated in two more.
The game’s scoring concluded with a Lange two-run home run, which extended her RBI count to nine for the weekend and an Ivy League-best 64 for the season.
HARVARD 10, DARTMOUTH 9
The first matchup of yesterday’s doubleheader was the closest of the weekend, with the lead switching hands nearly every inning.
After being tied in the first inning, 1-1, the Crimson took a 2-1 lead in the second on an error by the visitors.
But Dartmouth came back swinging in the third, scoring seven runs to gain an 8-2 lead on Harvard.
The Crimson responded in the fourth by scoring seven runs of its own, taking back the lead, 9-8.
After a scoreless fifth inning, the Big Green tied the game back up in the sixth at 9-9, but ultimately lost, 10-9, in the seventh when Harvard junior Eve Rosenbaum scored off of an Olson single to left center field.
HARVARD 9, DARTMOUTH 7
The second half of Saturday’s doubleheader proved much like the third game of the weekend, with the Crimson gaining and losing the lead several times throughout the matchup before ultimately winning, 9-7.
RBI singles up the middle from Lange and Macadam helped Harvard grab hold of an early 3-0 lead in the top of the second inning.
But the Crimson soon found itself in the opposite position, when three innings later, Harvard was losing, 7-4, after the bottom of the fifth.
The deficiency didn’t last long, as the Crimson scored six runs in the top of the sixth to take back the lead, 9-7.
After knocking a two-RBI triple to bring in Olson and junior shortstop Jane Alexander, Macadam scored on an illegal pitch. Junior first baseman Whitney Shaw then singled to right field to bring in Lange and Regan, the last runs scored in the matchup.
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 1
In the first game of the weekend, Brown and the Harvard defense silenced the Dartmouth bats, striking out six batters and allowing the Big Green only one run in seven innings.
After a scoreless first two innings, the Crimson offense came alive in the top of the third, with a Lange three-run home run.
In the fifth, Harvard sophomore Ashley Heritage plated in two more with a single down the left field line, to bring the Crimson’s lead to 5-1.
Harvard scored three in the top of the seventh with an RBI single from Zumbro and an Alexander single that brought home Zumbro and Heritage.
The victory earned the Crimson both the North Division title and home-field advantage at Ivy League Championships next weekend. It will host either Cornell or Penn, which will play a doubleheader this week.
“Having home-field advantage is great,” freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone said. “It really sets the tone for things. They have to come to us, they have to beat us on our own field, and it gives us an upper hand right from the get-go.”
“It’s so important,” Lange agreed. “The fans here are just awesome. It’s our house, and we’re not going to let anyone take us down in our house.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard-Yale-Princeton never needs an introduction, but the rivalry takes on special significance when the schools are ranked first, second, and fourth in the country.
In lightweight dual racing, it simply doesn’t get any bigger than this.
With the stakes the highest they’ve been all season, the Crimson lightweights delivered their best performance yet.
No. 2 Harvard’s first and second varsity eights both earned victories over the No. 1 Tigers and No. 4 Bulldogs in the team’s final dual race and the seniors’ last race ever on the Charles.
The victory in the first varsity eight gave the Crimson the Goldthwait Cup for the second straight year and will, in all likelihood, grant Harvard the top seed at EARC Sprints and the top spot in the national rankings.
The Crimson second varsity eight also likely earned itself the top seed at Sprints, and the top two eights led Harvard to a runaway victory in the Vogel Cup, which uses a points-based system to recognize the top team finish. The Crimson won with 36 points, while Princeton was second with 23 and Yale was third with 21.
FIRST AND SECOND VARSITY EIGHTS
They say that third 500 meters is where races are won and lost.
Indeed, the Harvard 1V’s dominant third 500 sent it straight to the top of the nation.
The Tigers took a slight lead in the race’s early stages, but all three crews were fairly even in the first half of the race.
“I think we were probably a seat or maybe two seats down in the first 750 meters,” seven seat Austin Meyer said.
“It was pretty much neck and neck across all three crews,” added captain and six seat Will Newell.
But all that changed when the Crimson crossed through the Mass. Ave Bridge.
“We made a really strong push in the third 500 that got us five or six seats,” Meyer said.
Harvard’s pace proved too much for the Bulldogs to handle.
While Princeton was able to maintain overlap with the Crimson, it was never able to retake the seats it lost, and Harvard was able to survive a late Tiger surge to win by a one-second margin.
“I think it’s one of the best pieces we’ve put together,” Meyer said. “It was really a focused and internal effort on everyone’s part.”
It was the second straight year in which the 1V has gone unbeaten in dual season.
This season, that spotlight was shared by the Crimson’s 2V, which has also won every race this season.
While it was Harvard’s second half that earned the boat the victory in the 1V race, the 2V made its biggest move in the middle 1000 meters of the race.
The Crimson reached the 500-meter mark around three seats behind Princeton, but managed to convert that into a three-seat lead on the Tigers by the 1000-meter mark. Harvard continued to move on the Tigers in the third 500, and by the time the boats reached the final push of the race, the Crimson’s lead was too much for Princeton to overcome, and Harvard earned a 1.9-second victory over the Tigers and a 9.8-second victory over Yale.
The Crimson 2V, which had been seeded fourth in the latest EARC polls despite having won all of its races, will likely earn the top seed in the final seeding poll.
It would have been hard to script a better ending for the seniors in Harvard’s top two boats—Newell, Andrew Trott, and Jared Dourdeville in the 1V, and coxswain Lizzy Maybank and rowers Tyler Caldwell, Sean Duncan, Billy Hennrikus, and Ben Bayley in the 2V.
“There’s nothing else you can ask for,” Newell said.
THIRD VARSITY EIGHT
While the Crimson 3V was unable to match the success of its 1V and 2V counterparts, its finish ahead of Princeton helped Harvard win the Vogel Trophy and the 3V better its own seeding for the Sprints.
The Bulldogs, clearly the fastest crew in the race, took an early and sizeable lead, leaving the Crimson and the Tigers to duke it out for second place.
Harvard had a slight lead over Princeton heading into the halfway mark and used a strong push in the third 500 to help it earn the second-place finish. Yale cruised to a 10-second victory and posted a time 3.4 seconds faster than its own 2V.
FRESHMAN EIGHTS
While the varsity rankings in the EARC polls are bound to change dramatically, the freshman seeding seems to be spot-on. In the 1F event, the crews finished in exactly the order they were seeded, with the top-seeded Bulldogs winning, the fourth-seeded Tigers in second, and the fifth-seeded Crimson in third.
“We didn’t get a very good start, and Princeton and Yale got a length lead pretty early,” said Harvard freshman coach Linda Muri. “Our guys ... pushed back. They had to spend a lot of energy to [get back into it]. That kind of gassed them for the rest of the race.”
Because the Tigers and the Bulldogs didn’t have 2Fs, the Crimson’s 2F raced against a Yale 4V/2F combination crew and the Princeton 4V. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the experienced rowers carried the day, with the Bulldogs winning, the Tigers in second, and Harvard in third.
“We knew it was going to be tough, and they were just going to do as well as they could do,” Muri said. “[Princeton and Yale] got a good jump off the start, which you expect from varsity oarsmen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team was in action up and down the East Coast this weekend, as it competed in the Brown Springtime Invitational and the Penn Relays. The team continued its trend of personal-best performances in Providence, R.I., while a school record fell in Philadelphia.
“This weekend went well,” said Crimson coach Jason Saretsky. “Our student-athletes handled the conditions and competed hard.”
BROWN SPRINGTIME INVITATIONAL
Yesterday, the Harvard squad competed against a number of schools from the New England area at Brown’s Springtime Invitational.
Younger members of the Crimson squad blossomed at the meet, including freshman thrower Adabelle Ekechukwu. Ekechuwku posted her best mark of the season (50.62 meters) in the hammer throw, which was good for fifth place overall.
On the men’s side, freshman Dustin Brode won the shot put with a personal-best throw of his own. His distance of 17.01 meters earned him the event win.
“[Our throwers] had a very strong weekend,” Saretsky said. “They’re continuing to do a great job for us, and it’s exciting to see them continue to put up big marks week after week.”
Junior John Dingus also had a strong showing at Brown, as he ran the 400-meter dash in a blistering 48.11 seconds to win the event.
PENN RELAYS
The Harvard team also traveled to Philadelphia this weekend to compete in the oldest and largest track and field invitational in the country, the Penn Relays. Some of the team’s members were taken aback by the magnitude of the event.
“The atmosphere at the Penn Relays was incredible,” freshman Alaina Murphy said. “I’ve never performed in front of so many people in my life.”
But the big stage didn’t intimidate the Crimson, as its runners and throwers turned in a number of strong performances.
Harvard’s 4x800 meter relay team had the weekend’s biggest showing, breaking the school record in the event with a time of 7:29.41.
Junior Darcy Wilson was the lead-off runner for the Crimson, with classmate Brian Paison and sophomore Weishen Mead running the middle legs, and co-captain Brian Hill in the anchor position.
It was a strategic decision to have Wilson in the lead-off position in this race. During the first leg, he was able to avoid being crowded by other runners and handed off to Paison with Harvard in the front of the pack.
“[Wilson] is not going to get pushed around,” Hill said. “In a very crowded race, he’s still going to be able to find his own speed.”
When Paison received the baton, there was congestion in the exchange area. He ran into and knocked over a runner from Clemson University, but still managed to finish his leg and keep the Crimson within striking distance from the leaders.
Mead, who was coming off of personal-best performances in the 800, was next for the relay team. His split of 1:53.73 put the squad in third place going into the race’s final leg.
Hill found himself well behind runners from Clemson and Hampton when he received the baton and knew that he would need to run his best race of the year if he hoped to improve his team’s position.
Luckily for the Crimson, that’s exactly what he did.
After keeping his distance in the first lap, Hill drew a roar from the crowd as he made a move around Hampton’s Jaleel Rogers to go into second place. The senior then began closing the gap between himself and Clemson’s anchor, Nathan Hendershot. With 300 meters to go, Hendershot made a big mistake.
“The Clemson kid looked back,” Hill said. “And when he did that, I was like, ‘Now, I have to get you.’”
Hill moved into first place with 150 meters to go and was able to hold off a late surge by Hendershot to win the heat by 0.09 seconds.
“It was a culmination of four years of him really making track and field the highest priority with his academics,” Saretsky said. “It was on display during that anchor leg. He took it to another level.”
Harvard’s other relay teams found success at Penn, as well. The women’s 4x400 meter relay team finished in sixth place with a time of 3:51.82.
The team was composed of Murphy, classmate Natalia Paine, junior Meghan Looney, and co-captain Thea Lee, who do not typically run the 400.
“It was our goal to have a lot of fun,” Murphy said. “We ran against other Ivy League schools, and we beat people. It was cool because we are usually [800-meter] runners.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rowers say there’s no such thing as a perfect race, and maybe there’s no such thing as a perfect season either.
But up to this point, Harvard’s performance has been about as good as it gets.
All of the Crimson’s eights are undefeated and top-seeded in the EARC, and this weekend—Harvard’s last on the Charles and last dual race before Sprints—the Crimson was triumphant once again, prevailing over Northeastern in the first varsity and first freshman races to take the Smith Cup.
“It’s a mix of dedication on our part and just great coaching,” said junior Mike DiSanto, three seat of the first varsity eight.
While a loss by the freshman four to the Huskies marked the first time a Harvard boat has lost to any opposing crews—including 4V wins over Princeton’s 3V and 1Vs—the 4+ race was a scrimmage, rather than a race for shirts, and therefore the Crimson can rightfully call itself undefeated.
FIRST VARSITY EIGHT
Harvard’s most dominant win came in the first varsity eight race, which the Crimson won by 14.7 seconds.
“We got up, and we just kept moving,” DiSanto said. “That’s something we’ve been working on ... We had what I think was the best race of our season.”
Harvard earned a commanding lead in the first 500, and by the end of the race, it seemed to be racing itself more than it was racing against Northeastern.
“The most important thing to us was rowing our race,” DiSanto said. “We kind of talked about ‘If we do our thing, everything else will fall into place.’ I was really happy with it. I think all the other guys were equally as happy. Everybody in our boat understood that it was our dress rehearsal for Sprints. Guys realized that this race was just as important as any other one we’ve raced this year.”
SECOND AND THIRD VARSITY EIGHTS
While the 1V race proved to be rather one-sided, the race between the Crimson’s 2V and 3V was a hotly contested battle.
Northeastern didn’t have a 2V or a 3V, so Harvard’s eights raced each other.
The 2V’s win over its own 3V was unsurprising, but the 3V kept the race impressively close.
“It looked like the 3V had a very strong row,” said captain Anthony Locke, four seat of the first varsity eight. “I think they were very happy with it.”
The 3V managed to stay neck and neck with the 2V for the first 500 before the 2V made a move in the second 500 that would prove to be the race-winner.
But the 3V never allowed the 2V open water, which was especially impressive given that the 2V had moved to the 3V’s bow deck in the third 500, pushing it out of the line of sight of the 3V’s rowers.
The 3V actually moved in on the 2V in the sprint, and the 2V only won by seven to eight seats.
“That was really close,” DiSanto said. “I think it was back and forth pretty much down the entire course. The JV got them in the end. When we were paddling [up to the starting line], everyone was pretty happy to see that kind of intra-squad competition. Both of those boats are very fast—I think that bodes well for Sprints.”
FRESHMEN
The tightest race of the day was the first freshman event, and the Crimson was only able to pull out a 1.2-second victory.
The crews were dead even for the first 1000 meters to the point where their bow balls were nearly indistinguishable from each other.
Harvard took a move in the third 500 that gave it a three to four-seat lead. While the Huskies was able to halt the Crimson’s move, they were never able to counter, and Harvard squeezed out a narrow victory.
The Crimson crossed the line in 6:03.1, while the Northeastern finished in 6:04.3. Both eights’ times were faster than the 6:11.4 posted by the Huskies’ 1V.
Harvard’s 4V also participated in the race and finished well off the pace set by the 1Fs.
“They had a really good race on their hands,” Locke said. “That’s going to give them a little more motivation going into Sprints.”
“Northeastern’s freshman [eight] is one of the best freshman eights in the league,” DiSanto said. “They’ll be good in the coming years with that freshman class.”
The Huskies had their way in the first race of the day: the freshman four event. Northeastern moved to open water early in the race and was able to maintain a steady lead throughout en route to a 2.9-second advantage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing the team that had eliminated his squad from postseason contention in last year’s regular season finale, Harvard men’s lacrosse co-captain Dean Gibbons decided that this time around, he didn’t want his season—or his collegiate career—to be over quite yet.
It was a tone Gibbons set early on his Senior Day, and his teammates responded. In so doing, the Crimson lived to play another day, earning a bid to the Ivy League Tournament with a 9-5 victory over No. 14 Yale on Saturday.
With the win, Harvard (9-5, 3-3 Ivy) earned the No. 3 seed in the four-team bracket—while bumping the Bulldogs (10-3, 3-3) down to the four-spot—and will play No. 2 Penn in the first round of the tournament in Ithaca, N.Y., on Friday.
“The Yale game is a huge game regardless of the Ivy Tournament implications,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “With the old rivalry, there was a lot of emotion, a lot of energy and effort in this game. We played really hard and left it on the field; I don’t think there was one point today when I wasn’t happy with the effort.”
After falling behind by at least a two-goal deficit to begin its three previous Ancient Eight contests, Gibbons got the Crimson an early lead in the must-win match Saturday. With 5:23 left in the opening period, senior Matt Hull came around the net and hit his classmate in front, and Gibbons beat Yale goaltender Jonathan Falcone with a line-drive shot to put Harvard up, 1-0.
Later in the quarter, Falcone blocked three consecutive attempts by Harvard sophomore Jack Doyle, but junior Jeff Cohen was able to put back the rebound off the third shot to double the Crimson advantage.
“[The early lead] was nice,” Wojcik said. “I think we’ve had a real problem starting [in the past].”
Harvard sophomore goaltender Harry Krieger held the Bulldogs off the scoreboard for most of the period, until he was beaten by Yale’s Jack Flaherty with just 28 seconds remaining.
But in the second quarter, Krieger would hold the shutout for all 15 minutes, making six saves in the process. Yale replacement goalie Jack Meyer matched him stop-for-stop until 2:49, when Gibbons fought his way towards the goal through contact and beat Meyer while falling forward, giving the Crimson a 3-1 lead heading into the half.
“I got lucky early and was able to find the back of the net,” said Gibbons, who finished the year second in the Ivy League with 53 points. “The other guys stepped up and kind of made my job easy.”
Harvard added to its advantage 12:38 into the third, when Doyle took a pass from Gibbons, wound up, and fired past Meyer to make it 4-1. But seven seconds later, the Elis responded, when Cole Yeager picked up a post-faceoff groundball, ran through the Crimson zone with little opposition, and beat Krieger low.
At 6:38, Yale’s Matt Gibson came from behind the net and scored, and under a minute later Flaherty tied the game at four by squeezing through two hits before beating Krieger.
But Harvard would dominate the remainder of the game offensively.
With 2:37 left in the third, junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan took an outlet pass, sprinted half the field, and fired past Meyer in transition to put the Crimson back ahead. Under a minute later, Vaughan cut towards the net, took a pass from Gibbons, and scored again to put Harvard up by two.
Yale cut the lead to one at 11:17, when Mark Dobrosky beat Krieger off a cross-field pass, but the Harvard goalie would shut the Elis out the rest of the way.
The Crimson added three goals of its own to clinch the win. At 8:55, junior Terry White bounced off a defender and fired a high shot past Meyer from 12 yards out. Four minutes later, sophomore Peter Schwartz came from behind and found himself with an open look after Meyer had been pulled out of the crease. Cohen added an easy score shortly thereafter, finishing the year as the team-leader with 28 goals.
“I think our offense started to really possess the ball and play smart, try to take the air out of their offense,” Gibbons said. “We just held the ball and tried to not make any turnovers, and we were able to do that effectively.”
Krieger capped a dominant, 16-save performance with a cross-body save on a Bulldog attempt with 30 seconds to go.
“Unbelievable,” Wojcik said. “Harry was seeing the ball really well right from the start, he just made so many big saves that not only kept us in it, but kept us in it where we could pull away...he’s just been getting better every single game.”
The Crimson will need two more strong performances from its goalie if it is going to keep the year going with wins in Ithaca next weekend.
“When you’re a senior, it all kind of hits you.” Gibbons said. “This is it for me; this [could be] my last time playing competitive sports in a team environment. We just wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to extend the season as long as possible. We did that today, so hopefully we can keep it going next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team’s strong performance this weekend earned them a sixth-place finish in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Championship at the Indiana University Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatic Center. It was the Crimson’s (17-15, 3-2 CWPA) highest finish in the tournament since 2005.
Harvard went 2-2 in the championships winning against Bucknell and Gannon while losing to No. 20 Princeton and dropping a close one-goal loss to the eventual tournament champion, No. 13 Indiana.
“Indiana just won the championship game, and we only lost to them by one point,” freshman Shayna Price said. “It really shows we are right there with these teams, and we can come back next year just as strong.”
PRINCETON 11, HARVARD 8
In its final game of the season, the Crimson took on No. 20 Princeton with a fifth-place finish in the CWPA Championships on the line.
The Tigers (16-10, 4-1) took an early two-goal advantage, thanks to scores by senior Tanya Wilcox, en route to a 7-4 halftime lead.
Harvard started the second half strong with goals by sophomores Elise Molnar and Aisha Price. Sister Shayna Price evened the score with a penalty-shot score, her second free-penalty shot and score of the day.
“I had an opportunity to two penalty shots,” Shayna Price said. “So those weren’t really [just] my goals—someone pulled off a great foul, and I was able to finish for them.”
The run forced Princeton to call a timeout to regroup.
The respite served the Tigers well, as the team responded with two quick scores which proved too much for Harvard to overcome.
Despite the loss, the team finished its season playing well and only losing to ranked teams.
“We were very happy with our outcome of the weekend,” Shayna Price said. “We had some very close games, and I think overall we played our hearts out. We are proud of what we did this season.”
HARVARD 13, BUCKNELL 8
The Crimson rebounded from its tough loss the night before against Indiana to take a 13-8 win over the Bison (13-18, 1-4).
Both teams came out firing at the start, with each side scoring two goals in the first four minutes of play.
Harvard pushed the lead to 4-2 with back-to-back goals by Shayna Price and junior Lizzie Abbott.
Bucknell came back to tie the game at five in the third period. But the Crimson responded with three consecutive scores to build a late 8-5 lead.
Junior Monica Zdrojewski started the run with a man-up goal before junior co-captain Devan Kennifer and junior Shannon Purcell finished the run.
Kennifer had three goals and was named Player of the Game by the CWPA.
The lead proved to be too much for the Bison to overcome.
“I was a little concerned about a letup emotionally and physically; after playing such a tough game the night before,” Minnis said. “Bucknell has done a great job this year of continually getting better. We talked about taking that first half, playing well, keeping the game close, and taking advantage of that third quarter push. We did [all] that.”
INDIANA 7, HARVARD 6
The Crimson rally fell just short against the No. 13 Hoosiers (25-11, 3-2) in the team’s second game on Friday night.
“[Indiana] is the No. 13 team in the country and [won] the championship,” Minnis said. “We were really focused on them, and we did a really good job. I’m so proud of the way the girls played. They played real hard; they played some good quarters.”
Indiana had the home-field advantage and fed off the crowd’s energy on its Senior Night, as the team jumped out to take a 4-3 halftime lead.
After the half, Indiana extended the lead by outscoring Harvard, 3-1, in the third quarter.
The Crimson rallied in the fourth with two goals in the last six minutes.
Harvard got two shots on goal to try to tie the game, but Hoosiers goalie Cassie Wyckoff came up with the saves to preserve the lead and ensure the Indiana win.
“We talked about [how it was Indiana’s] Senior Night, and we talked about how it was going to be a very electric building for them,” Minnis said. “They were really going to play off of that for the first half. [The goal] for us [was] to keep it close and make the push in the third and fourth quarter, and we did that. We gave ourselves an opportunity to tie it at the end, [but] it just didn’t float in for us.”
HARVARD 17, GANNON 3
The Crimson started the weekend with a dominant performance against the Golden Knights (9-19, 0-5).
“We played good defense,” Minnis said. “I think we settled down and played well...It was a good game to start the tournament with, to get the jitters out, and to get ready for a tough game [against Indiana].
Harvard was led by the strong play of Zdrojewski and Purcell, who had five and four goals respectively.
All five of Zdrojewski’s scores came in the first half, giving the Crimson an insurmountable 12-2 halftime advantage.
“[Zdrojewski and Purcell] did a good job of getting themselves into a position where they could shoot and score,” Minnis said. “[Zdrojewski] has done that all year; she has over 60 goals this year, second on the team in scoring. Shannon is leading the team in assists, so it’s nice to see her take a few goals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming out of halftime down by four to Dartmouth with a share of the Ivy League championship on the line, it seemed as if the Harvard women’s lacrosse team was poised to make a comeback.
Just 95 seconds into the second period, Crimson sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen took a pass from junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind and beat the Big Green goalkeeper to bring Harvard within three, 8-5.
But the Crimson’s comeback attempt was stifled as quickly as it began. Dartmouth dominated the next 16 minutes of play, using a 6-1 run to build an insurmountable 14-6 lead.
Harvard found the back of the net once more before the final whistle, but it was not nearly enough, as the visiting Crimson (9-5, 5-2) fell, 14-7, to the Big Green (10-3, 6-1) Friday night at Scully-Fahey Field.
“Dartmouth came out strong and is obviously a good team,” VanderMeulen said. “We were a little flat and didn’t quite play our game.”
The loss dropped Harvard into a tie for third place with Princeton in the Ancient Eight standings. Meanwhile, the win propelled Dartmouth to a tie atop the standings with Penn and a share of the program’s 11th Ivy League title.
While the Crimson failed to capitalize on the opportunity to earn its first conference championship since 1993, Harvard’s season is far from over.
The Crimson will travel to Penn’s Franklin Field this coming weekend to participate in the four-team Ivy League tournament, with the winner earning the Ancient Eight’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The third-seeded Harvard squad will meet a familiar opponent in Friday’s semifinal matchup—No. 2 Dartmouth.
When the Crimson meets the Big Green again next weekend, Harvard hopes it can improve on its early-game performance.
In Friday’s contest, the Crimson fell behind quickly, going down by as many as five goals in the first half.
Dartmouth’s Courtney Bennet drew first blood, notching the first of her three goals of the night just 68 seconds into the contest.
Harvard had a number of opportunities to even the score in the early going, but two saves by rookie Big Green goalie Kristen Giovanniello and a pair of errant shot attempts kept the Crimson off the board.
After falling behind 2-0, Harvard finally found the back of the net 10 minutes into the contest thanks to a score from junior Jess Halpern.
But Dartmouth won the ensuing draw control and pushed its lead back up to two with a score from Kat Collins off a pass from Greta Meyer.
It didn’t take long for the Big Green to light up the scoreboard again. This time, Meyer did it herself, scoring off a free-position shot 35 seconds later that put Dartmouth ahead, 4-1, and forced Harvard coach Lisa Miller to burn an early timeout.
The Crimson came out of the timeout firing, outshooting the Big Green 9-0 over the next 9:10 of play. But Harvard was unable to find the back of the net, as Giovanniello came up with four saves during the stretch.
“I think we played against a really good goalie last night,” Baskind said.
With 8:30 left in the first half, VanderMeulen finally snuck one past Giovanniello, scoring off a free-position shot.
The Big Green responded, rattling off three scores in less than two minutes to grab the commanding 7-2 advantage with 4:50 to play, and Dartmouth went into the break leading, 8-4.
Harvard, which has trailed at halftime in five of its nine wins this season, appeared ready to mount another comeback when VanderMeulen notched her second score of the game early in the second period.
But Collins won the ensuing draw control for the Big Green and raced to the Crimson goal where she finished an unassisted score in 17 seconds.
It took just 16 more seconds for Collins to record her next score, as she finished a pass from Kristen Goldberg to put Dartmouth ahead, 10-5.
Things kept going downhill for the Crimson from there, as the Big Green continued on its 6-1 run that featured three scores from Meyer.
Meyer notched Dartmouth’s last tally of the night with 12:27 to play, finishing a pass from Bennett. A late score from VanderMeulen made the final score 14-7.
The Crimson women will put the biggest loss of its season behind them and will focus on the task ahead.
“We’re really excited about the opportunity to face them again,” Baskind said. “As frustrated as we are, I think it would be a lot more frustrating if we didn’t have [that] chance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping two games at Dartmouth on Saturday, the Harvard baseball team (9-36, 5-15 Ivy) hoped to rebound at home in its third and fourth contests against the Big Green (28-10, 14-6). But unfortunately for the Crimson, this season’s Rolfe Division champions upheld their title, as Harvard dropped both games of its final twinbill of the season at O’Donnell Field yesterday afternoon.
DARTMOUTH 10, HARVARD 8
Before the start of the sixth inning, the Crimson was up 6-1 over last year’s Ivy League champions. But a 9-2 run in the remaining three innings led Dartmouth to victory.
“We were in the second [game of the day]…and I wish we could have come out on top,” captain catcher Tyler Albright said. “It was exciting and kind of a downer to go out of the season like that.”
Harvard came out strong in yesterday’s nightcap, as junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds batted in senior shortstop Sean O’Hara for the first score of the game with two outs in the first. Albright carried the momentum into the second inning, batting in two runners to push Harvard to an early 3-0 lead.
In the top of the third, O’Hara hit a long home run over the scoreboard to put the Crimson up by four, and in the following two innings, Harvard outscored Dartmouth, 2-1.
“O’Hara’s [home run] was an absolute bomb, and that was awesome for him,” Albright said. “He just absolutely crushed that.”
Senior pitcher Ben Sestanovich started the game for the Crimson, striking out eight batters and allowing two hits in 5.1 innings.
In the top of the sixth, Dartmouth took over, earning three runs to put the game within two on a two-RBI single from senior second baseman Jeff Onstott and an RBI fly out from sophomore Ennis Coble.
Harvard came back to close out the inning, as freshman leftfielder Jack Colton hit a home run to left field and batted in freshman outfielder Jeff Hajdin.
“[Colton’s hit] was a laser shot through the bushes,” Albright said. “It helps us gain a lot of momentum when we have guys who can hit it out of the yard like that.”
Although Harvard increased its lead to four in the bottom of the sixth, a five-run seventh inning put the Big Green on top.
“When you’re giving up 10 runs on six hits, it’s just not there,” Walsh said. “When you get in the game and you’re up 8-4 going into the last couple innings, you need to win those games.”
With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, senior leftfielder Sam Franklin hit a groundball right to the Dartmouth infield but a missed throw allowed the senior to get on base. The Crimson was unable to capitalize on the error, as senior shortstop Sean O’Hara grounded out to end the game.
DARTMOUTH 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson struggled early on in its first game of the day, as three errors allowed Dartmouth to score an unearned run in the first inning.
Junior lefty pitcher Brent Suter walked Big Green senior outfielder Sam Bean to set up the play after a grounder sent Dartmouth’s first batter back to the dugout. Bean advanced to second on a throwing error, as Suter attempted to pick off Bean at first. A pop fly by Dartmouth sophomore catcher Chris O’Dowd was dropped in the infield and an attempt to throw the runner out at third backfired, helping Bean to third and eventually home. This run gave the Big Green a lead it would not relinquish, despite a strong late effort by the Crimson.
“We didn’t run the bases well,” Walsh said. “We made mistakes out there. The little things it takes to win ballgames, we just didn’t do well.”
After a grounder and two strikeouts made the bottom of the first a quick half-inning, Dartmouth struck again in the second to take a 2-0 lead. Junior outfielder David Turnbull batted in freshman Jeff Keller—who earned Dartmouth’s first hit of the day on the previous play—with a double to right center.
Harvard narrowed the gap to one in the bottom of the third, after senior shortstop Sam Franklin was hit by a pitch with two outs. Reynolds earned the RBI for the Crimson, sending home Franklin with a single up the middle.
The Big Green—which outhit Harvard 7-4—held on for the victory, tallying the game’s final run in the fourth inning on a Bean RBI. Three scoreless innings followed, as the Crimson was unable to string together hits.
Suter had an impressive game on the mound for the Crimson, striking out 11 batters in seven innings pitched.
Though the 2011 season proved to be a disappointing one for the Crimson, which failed to qualify for the Ivy League championships, the squad looked positively upon the season.
“[Playing at Harvard] been a great experience,” Albright said. “Obviously we would have liked a few more wins, but when it comes down to it, that’s not what matters. We have a great group of guys, great teammates, and great coaches, and it’s been an absolute pleasure to play here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 13 Radcliffe heavyweights (11-4) wrapped up the dual meet season last Saturday, as the heavyweights competed against other Boston schools—Boston College, MIT, Boston University and Northeastern—in the fifth annual Beanpot Regatta.
With near-perfect weather and ideal rowing conditions on the Charles, all four Black and White heavyweight crews fared well against the local competition, ending the regular season with added momentum before entering the postseason.
“We’ve definitely been building speed, confidence, and momentum throughout the course of the season,” said senior co-captain Rachel Rauh. “But everyone is still so excited about finding even more speed and those last few seconds that we need to really be competitive with Princeton at Sprints. But we feel really confident that we’ve been pushing in that direction.”
With a first-place finish in the Varsity Eight, Radcliffe laid claim to its fourth Beanpot title in its five years. And the additional victories of the Black and White 2V and Varsity Four A, in addition to the second-place finish of the 3V, Radcliffe showcased its the depth of its team and mastery of the Charles.
For the rowers, the Beanpot Regatta provided further evidence that the Black and White’s efforts so far this season has made them well-positioned to produce winning results at the EAWRC Sprints later in May.
“I think that we are really proud of our performance,” said junior 1V rower Liz Soutter. “Obviously, it’s always a good feeling to win a race. Our next race is at the Eastern Sprints, so this weekend was a great rehearsal for that.”
The Black and White and the Huskies both started out strong against the field in the Varsity Eight race, with Radcliffe holding a slight lead for the first 500 meters. From that point on, it was a two-boat race, as Northeastern surged ahead to stay in contention for a first-place finish. But during the final 1000 meters, Radcliffe began to widen its lead as it opened a boat-length gap against the Huskies.
In the end, Radcliffe’s vigorous pace proved too much for its local rivals, as the Black and White crossed the finish line first with a time of 6:43.9, while the Huskies completed the course 8.1 seconds behind with a time of 6:52.0. In the battle for third place, the Terriers was able to hold off the Engineers, as Boston University finished 2.7 ahead of MIT with a time of 6:59.7, while the Engineers finished in 7:02.4. The Eagles were fifth, finishing 17.2 seconds behind fourth-place MIT with a time of 7:19.6.
With its first-place finish, the Radcliffe Heavyweight crew not only captured the Beanpot title, but also added two additional trophies to its cabinets. For its victory over BU, the Black and White held on the Allen-DeWolfe Trophy, and for its defeat of Northeastern, Radcliffe reclaimed the Rowlands Trophy back from the Huskies.
During the Second Varsity Eight race, the Black and White established its rhythm early on and never looked back, as it rowed away to an open-water victory. In this dominant performance, Radcliffe recorded a time of 7:07.0, finishing more than 12 seconds ahead of second-place Northeastern (7:19.8). BU placed third with a time of 7:26.3, with MIT in fourth in 7:38.0 and BC fifth (7:43.5).
In the third race of the day, the Black and White Varsity Four A recorded an open-water victory as it pulled away from the field to win by 9.3 seconds (7:43.5). Radcliffe was followed by the Huskies (7:52.8), Terriers (7:58.5) and Eagles (8:15.4).
The final race of the day for the Black and White Heavyweights was the 3V race. In this race, both of the Radcliffe 3V and 4V crews started together on the line against crews from Northeastern, BU, and BC.
The Huskies crew got off the line very quickly and led throughout the first half of the race. But by the second 1000 meters, the Black and White 3V fought back and closed down Northeastern’s lead. At the conclusion of the race, the Huskies were able to hold on, crossing the finish line in 7:15.0, while the Radcliffe 3V finished 1.9 seconds behind with a time of 7:16.9. BU finished third with a time of 7:29.2, while BC came in fourth (7:39.6). The Radcliffe 4V finished fifth with a time of 8:04.1.
After two weeks of strong performances and victories—against Yale to win the Case Cup and in the Beanpot Regatta—Radcliffe just might have found the momentum builder it needs as it looks ahead to the EAWRC Sprints, set to take place in two weeks’ time.
“I think that the 1V boat has been pretty confident throughout this season, but I think that the other boats having wins this weekend was definitely a confidence booster,” Soutter said. “The great thing about Sprints is that the results of each boat is equally as important. It’s really important that every boat is making a difference towards the team’s result. So I think that a lot of people are feeling pretty confident heading towards Sprints.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4 Radcliffe lightweights (6-2), much like their heavyweight counterparts, also saw success on the Charles last Saturday. In its final dual meet of the season, the Black and White left its local rival MIT black and blue after a day of dominating performances.
With EAWRC Sprints Championships looming just two weeks away, Radcliffe could have easily looked past No. 7 MIT on Saturday and stumbled.  However, faced with glorious a spring morning and near perfect conditions on the water, the Black and White was able to showcase its mastery of not only its local rival but of the Charles itself.
“I thought we performed pretty well,” said sophomore rower Elizabeth Hamilton. “We’ve been working really hard all winter and spring. The team has really come together, and we’ve been really putting in the hours. I think that the biggest takeaway from this weekend is that hard work can really take us places.”
In its three races, the Black and White recorded three blowout open-water wins against the Engineers to record a sweep for the day and to hold on to the Muri Cup for the third consecutive year.
With this commanding performance on the Charles this past weekend, the Radcliffe lightweights not only notched an important victory against its Cambridge rival, but also reasserted the Black and White’s momentum, which it had lost against the Tigers last weekend.
“Last week against Princeton, we gave our best effort but we came up short,” said junior coxswain Maryana Vrubel. “This week, in response, has given us confidence. We learned a lot this past couple of races. We learned that we have improved a lot. We also learned that we have a good amount of speed to work with, so we just need to keep giving it our all.”
In the 1V race, Radcliffe quickly established a fast-paced rhythm and pulled away early from its local rival MIT. After capturing the lead in the first 500 meters of the race, the Black and White would never look back, as its furious pace throughout the race powered the varsity crew to victory. By the race’s end, the Radcliffe 1V had extended its lead over the Engineers by more than 25 seconds to finish with a time of 7:04.12, while MIT finished with a time of 7:29.31.
In the 2V and the Varsity Four races, the Black and White won by even larger margins. In its race, the Radcliffe 2V recorded a time of 7:27.34 to beat the Engineers 2V (7:59.06) by a little less than 32 seconds. In the Varsity Four, Radcliffe won by an even larger margin, crushing MIT (9:05.02) by 44 seconds to win in 8:21.09.
“This weekend, I think we just went out there and had a really solid race,” Vrubel said. “When we were racing, it wasn’t just about beating [MIT], it was about putting out our best performance and getting the best time. So I guess the results that we posted were just a product of that.”
This past Saturday’s regatta marked the end of what has been an impressive season for the Black and White lightweights. In its eight dual meets, the Radcliffe 1V dropped only two races—to No.1 Princeton and No.2 Stanford—throughout the season. Heading into its two-week break before the Eastern Sprint Championships in Camden, N.J., the team will now look for additional ways to maximize its speed.
“Overall, as a team, we’ve worked on coming closer together so far this season, Vrubel said. “Also, we’ve worked on making all our boats faster than they were last year. I think that we accomplished that during this dual meet season. In every race, we worked on making each boat faster.”
“Looking forward, we are looking to do our best in both Sprints and in Nationals in the coming weeks,” Vrubel added. “We are going to continue to stay focused and work on making little tweaks everyday to get that extra edge in races.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team (9-34, 5-13 Ivy) scored just one run in its two games on Saturday, and the squad dropped yet another doubleheader to the Big Green (26-10, 12-6), losing, 4-1 and 6-0.
The team was swept in a doubleheader for the eighth time this year.
“This was a disappointing season for us in a big way. This was a losing season in the Ivy [League] and a losing season elsewhere,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “[Dartmouth is] a good ballclub, and they proved why they’ve been the champs the last couple years. Those guys really stepped up.”
DARTMOUTH 6, HARVARD 0
Through six innings, the second game of the twinbill was held scoreless. But the Big Green blew the game open in the seventh and the eighth, scoring three in each frame to take the easy 6-0 win.
Dartmouth chased senior starter Max Perlman in the seventh after he surrendered three runs, two of which were earned.
“We were going into the game knowing that we couldn’t win the Ivy League, so we just played for ourselves,” Perlman said. “We did what we could do, but their pitchers did very well to shut us down. But we kept fighting all throughout [Saturday].”
With the bases loaded, Big Green third baseman Jeff Keller singled to left to drive in a pair. A throwing error by freshman Jake McGuiggan allowed the third run come home all the way from first.
“It was 0-0 as we entered the seventh inning, and I was lucky enough to keep us in the game,” Perlman said. “I thought we played very well, but we just let it slip away.”
Perlman struck out the next batter, and junior southpaw Will Keuper came into the game in relief to retire the side.
In the eighth, the Big Green continued adding to its lead, driving home three off of the lefty to push the lead to six.
Though the team was never able to capitalize, Harvard had its chances to score.
In the second inning, junior Marcus Way, who already had advanced to third on a passed ball, made a break for the plate on an errant pitch from Dartmouth starter Mitch Horacek. But a quick recovery and throw from Big Green catcher Chris O’Dowd was in time, and Dartmouth ended the threat.
The Crimson had one more shot in the ninth to get on the board. With runners on second and third with one out, Way lined into a double play to end the game.
Senior Sean O’Hara went 2-for-3 and reached base three times, but Harvard was limited to just six hits.
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 1
Despite hurling a complete game, senior lefthander Eric Eadington could not keep Harvard in the game, surrendering three runs in the final two innings en route to Dartmouth’s 4-1 win.
The Big Green jumped out to a lead in the third, as Dartmouth’s lead-off hitter and shortstop Joe Sclafani drove in the game’s first run on an RBI groundout.
After another inning and a half of scoreless play, Big Green left fielder Sam Bean knocked a homer off of Eadington to right-center field, giving Dartmouth a three-run lead.
Harvard finally got things going in the sixth. Sophomore first baseman Danny Moskovits hit a double down the left-field line to put a runner in scoring position. Freshman left fielder Jack Colton singled up the middle, and the Crimson had runners on the corners with no outs.
Senior center fielder Dillon O’Neill grounded out to short, but the run came home to make the score 3-1.
But that’s as close as Harvard would get. Dartmouth added an insurance run in the bottom of the same frame, and Harvard could not mount a comeback.
“When you have this kind of season, you think you’re going to have an opportunity to turn things around…and we never got it for ourselves,” Walsh said.

If you're upset with your love life of late or feel like you're better at solving chemistry problem sets than developing chemistry with another student, help may be just a few short clicks away.
A slew of dating websites has begun sprouting up around Harvard's campus, each with its own twist, but all with one common goal: to connect students with their potential soulmates.
Date My School
One particular website, Date My School, created by Columia Business School students Balazs Alexa and Jean Meyer, has established itself at Columbia and NYU, and is beginning to make waves in the Boston area. Available at Harvard, BU, Tufts, and MIT, this site claims to be best for students who are looking for anything from a friend or a date to a "booty call" or a "green card."
Harvard students are certainly taking notice of Date My School, signing up for the site at a rate that would leave Mark Zuckerberg impressed. According to Alexa, about 5 percent of the University registered in a single weekend.
The founders of Date My School have focused their efforts on overcoming the negative connotations that are usually associated with online dating.
"I know that people have a bad idea of what online dating is about," Alexa said. "The problem is that no one has really come up with a better way to serve these needs that everyone has, from college students to young professionals. Everyone needs to find a partner. Why wouldn't we use these tools that we have to help us?"
Alexa compared online dating to writing a book with Microsoft Word as opposed to a typrwriter. "The quality of the book would probably be the same," he said. "But it's going to be less of a pain in the ass for the guy writing it with Microsoft Word."
Date My School aims to eliminate three typical issues with online dating websites: safety, inefficiency, and embarrassment. Users are required to have an email address from their respective college to access the site. From there, the site offers a number of ways in which a person's dating pool can be narrowed according to his preferences. If a user is embarrassed to be using the site, he can opt to only be viewable to other users who lie outside of his network. According to Alexa, dates have been arranged using the site in a matter of a few hours.
Date Harvard SQ
Matches are also being formed on Date Harvard SQ, a website created by Harvard Business School alumni Beri Meric and Philipp Triebel after they "realized that all too often, our friends, classmates and alumni were sacrificing romance for their education and careers." Meric and Triebel are hard at work to ensure that students no longer have to make this sacrifice.
IvyDate
The duo created a second website, IvyDate, to allow love-searching students to get in touch with current students and alumni at the eight Ivy League schools, as well as MIT, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics.
nChooseTwo
A student's friends can help him find love with nChooseTwo. This site lets students suggest that two of their friends go on a date with one another. nChooseTwo is based on the idea that couples often meet one another through mutual friends. Students at Harvard, MIT, and BU can search for romance on the site.
In a world becoming more and more connected through the internet, the development of online dating websites increases the opportunities that students have to interact with one another. Only time will tell whether or not relationships will develop as well.

If you're looking for somewhere to go after you finish your last final, why not explore Haymarket, Boston's historic open air market? Haymarket, which was opened in 1830, is an open-air fruit-and-vegetable market located in downtown Boston near Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market. With the beautiful weather and Haymarket's college-friendly prices, there are few reasons not to visit this Boston landmark.
