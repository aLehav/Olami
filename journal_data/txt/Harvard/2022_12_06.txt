Ramon “1000WORD$” Lazo is a photographer, show promoter, and creative strategist operating at the cutting edge of the East Coast hip-hop landscape. “I’m the media for people with no media,” he said in a sit-down interview with The Harvard Crimson. Perhaps best known for his Polaroid film portraits, 1000WORD$ has photographed the likes of Jay Electronica, Mach-Hommy, Nas, al.divino, Chaka Khan, Westside Gunn, ANKHLEJOHN, several members of the Wu-Tang Clan, the late DMX, and the late Nipsey Hussle, to name a few. Over his nearly decade-long career as a photographer, Lazo has built up a formidable Rolodex of artists whom he has called upon to perform at his own concerts and to appear on his 2020 “1000 Words” album that he curated with rapper 38 Spesh.
“Hip Hop Hooray,” the 1992 single by Naughty by Nature, was Lazo’s first introduction to hip-hop as a kid in the South Bronx. After hearing the track on his neighbor’s CD player, a young 1000WORD$ became obsessed with the culture of the emerging genre, but was never really interested in rapping himself. “I enjoy documenting a lot more,” he said. “Seeing everybody’s different talents and different ways of performing. Going to their neighborhoods and seeing things from their point of view for a brief second. I get a rush out of traveling and meeting new artists.”
Before picking up photography, 1000WORD$ was an avid hip-hop vinyl and CD collector. He regularly brought his records to East Coast concerts as a way to collect signatures and get face time with artists like Capone-N-Noreaga and Cam’ron. During this period, a pop-up in New York City hosted by the late A$AP Yams pushed Lazo to pursue photography.
“I actually got inspired because I went to an A$AP Yams auction,” 1000WORD$ said. “There was a signed Polaroid of him and I wanted to buy it. At the time, I didn’t understand that it wasn't an original Polaroid. It was a print, so they wanted a certain amount, but I ended up getting a different painting. After that I said, ‘Yo I could fuck around and do this shit myself.’”
Lazo bought his first Polaroid camera on eBay for $25. The first two images he took were of close friends. His third was of Harlem rapper Smoke DZA. Lazo began to treat his photography like his physical records, using the image as a vessel to collect artist signatures. “Eight wishes come in these film cartridges that I got in my hand,” he said. “I’m gonna make sure that these eight shots count, so that I can get my autographs.”
Instead of his vinyl and CDs, 1000WORD$ started bringing his Polaroid camera to concerts, waiting backstage — sometimes for several hours — for a chance to photograph the talent. Lazo said that this strategy emerged partly from his inexperience. “It’s tough when you try to be a photographer and go to these events,” he said. “You see everybody going to these events and you don't know how and people don't want to share those little connections with you, so you gotta figure it out on your own. What I did was play the wall. I see who I want to take a picture of and then come back to the wall. Go and then come back to the wall. Eventually I became a regular.”
Such an approach led 1000WORD$ to meet Conway the Machine, Westside Gunn, and Benny the Butcher of Griselda Records at their first-ever New York City show at Webster Hall in 2017. As a fan of the Buffalo label’s music, Lazo recognized Griselda affiliate Chef Dred standing outside the artist entrance to the venue and struck up conversation. “I had no access to the show. I didn’t know these guys. But, I see that they're backstage and I go: ‘Yo Mel, Can I get inside?’ He didn't even know me. I said, ‘I'm taking Polaroids.’ And he said, ‘Yeah, come on.’ So shout out to Chef Dred.”
“I went back there to the green room,” Lazo added. “And Conway was like, ‘Yo, everybody get the fuck out the room.’ So I stood there like a robot. Then everybody left and I just started flicking them up. Daringer was there. Gunn was there. I got all of them.”
In the half-decade since the Webster Hall show, Lazo has developed a close collaborative relationship with Westside Gunn and Griselda. His Polaroid of Conway the Machine serves as the cover art for the rapper’s 2019 single “Bang,” which features Eminem. Lazo’s image was used as the tour poster for Griselda’s 2021 “Claire’s Back” national tour. This September, 1000WORD$ enlisted Griselda rapper Stove God Cooks to perform at “The Cookout,” a show organized by Lazo himself. In November, he followed it up with “The Crib,” a concert in Providence, Rhode Island, that featured Griselda signee Rome Streetz as the headliner. When Westside Gunn and Stove God Cooks attended a Celtics game last month, 1000WORD$ was sitting on the floor with the two rappers. Lazo can be seen directly behind Westside Gunn in a post from the official Celtics Instagram.
“Shoutout to Westside Gunn because he inspired me as a kid from the Bronx to sell art, to treat my stuff as art,” 1000WORD$ said. “We listen to music and we all do our part, but some people understand the message. I'm very grateful that I get to see him and all his team elevate. It just inspires me to be great.”
1000WORD$’s photography is part documentarian and part art. On the one hand, his images are historical documents that serve as an important record for hip-hop; Lazo estimates his archive contains between one and two thousand individual Polaroids. Yet, the intimate nature of his portraits, the addition of signatures from his subjects, and the breadth of his coverage places Lazo in an artistic category with critically acclaimed portrait photographers like Annie Leibovitz and Deena Lawson. In 2021, two of his Polaroids featuring rappers Eto and RLX, respectively, were published in a retrospective about the history of Polaroid as an artistic medium.
“I just want to make sure that whenever I go that all my shit goes somewhere special because everybody that I took pictures of is special,” he said. “I want someone to be able to display that shit for the world to see.”
Lazo shared a personal dedication to his work. “I'm barely in my daughter's life right now due to certain circumstances that life hit me with, and I’m just trying to make everything right,” 1000WORD$ said. “I want to be able to leave a legacy for my kid because I have nothing else to leave behind. So, I love you and I hope whenever you get to read this, just know that I always love you.”

“Down in Atlanta,” the latest single from Travis Scott and Pharrell Williams, is a bouncy, entertaining love letter to southern hip-hop’s center and the birthplace of trap, Atlanta. However, it lacks the swelling grandeur that makes Scott’s best work amazing.
The track features the heavy, crisp bass and tapping trap drums that can be expected from Scott by this point in his career. Williams’s impact on the production and mixing is clear as well, as the legendary producer is able to create a classic danceable bounce. The beat starts strong, and accelerates as it moves, growing into its chorus as Scott’s voice raises registers. In the second chorus, the bass groove is matched with a high, screaming synth that hangs and bends nastily off key. The beat keeps moving, and adds enough to remain fresh throughout. There is nothing truly surprising thrown at the listener, which we have seen from Scott at his best, but the instrumental break near the end of the song provides an exciting contrast.
Scott’s delivery is similarly simple and effective, with characteristic autotuned vocals and high-pitched adlibs. His lyrics focus on his appreciation for the city of Atlanta, referencing cultural landmarks like the pub “Graveyard Tavern,” the strip-club “Magic City,” and a clever reference to Cleveland Avenue with “Not talkin’ LeBron home when I say I’m in Cleveland.” The song is an homage to trap culture, which Scott has become an integral part of. His performance isn’t lacking energy or clever one-liners, but it doesn’t bring anything truly new and exciting lyrically or vocally like he does in some of his defining verses on songs like “90210” or “Antidote.”
This song is good — it’s clean, grooving, and fun, as could be expected from a collaboration between two industry veterans like Scott and Williams. But, it lacks the powerful mix of features, glittering bridges, and epic beat-switches that made Scott’s masterpieces on albums like “Rodeo” so special. “Down in Atlanta” is a high-quality single, but it isn’t a good sign for fans who hope to see a return to Travis Scott’s heights of musical ambition and originality.

If there is one thing that half of the dynamic duo that comprises Lowertown — Avshalom (Avsha) Weinberg — wants you to take from this interview, it's to “take a listen to the album. You will like it. And that is good for you.” What album is he referring to? That is, of course, Lowertown's latest LP, “The Gaping Mouth.”
The album, released in October of 2022, is an evolution from their previous works in a key way. While continuing to create a “sense of relatability” that the band — and, in particular, the duo’s other half Olivia (Liv) Osby — has always tried to maintain, they are proud of this album for the variety of emotions that it has captured. Weinberg characterizes this record as a “little more angry” than their previous works, allowing it to be more reflective of how the world feels around them. It is representative of the acceptance that emotions like sadness or anger exist as a response to difficult life circumstances. However, their record isn’t completely hopeless as it captures a full range of emotions, recognizing that “equally amazing things can happen,” serving as inspiration for feelings of happiness.
Both members of the band express the fact that their main hope for their listeners is that they have “not only a distraction but something to look forward to because they feel understood.” Representation of emotions that makes audiences feel excluded is unfortunately too frequent. Lowertown wants to make sure that none of their listeners feel as if they are outcasts, but instead know that this is a community where they are not alone in their experiences.
Lowertown has a hard time being categorized into just one genre. The public has referred to them as bedroom pop while their PR has defined them as lo-fi darlings. However, when asked how the band would categorize themselves, the band would ideally be “genreless and nameless,” according to Lowertown. They don’t hate the title of lo-fi — although they recognize the fact that their music making process isn’t low fidelity — defining themselves as both “eclectic and lo-fi.” When asked what their inspirations were, band member Osby said that “whatever Radiohead is categorized as, that’s what I wanna be.”
While they have been evolving thematically and stylistically, the band has also begun evolving the visuals of their persona. Noting the importance of building “a world for the viewer to be immersed in,” the band understands that as many modes of media as possible must be utilized to keep audiences engaged. They understand that art can be stylized to such an extent that it builds a whole world that viewers can be obsessed with. In light of this, they have attempted to capture the emotions of “loneliness, anger, and confusion.” This has come to light not only through their very stylized and gothic album covers, but also their music videos. Weinberg highlights their “Bucktooth” video as a shift, “embracing more real life visuals and real life emotions” in order to convey the tone that they seek to offer their viewers.
Want to explore their music but don’t know where to start? The duo believes that their song “Waltz” is a perfect jumping off point. According to Osby, Waltz is “different from anything [the band] has ever made before” and it came out just as they hoped it would. Similarly, Weinberg describes the tone of the song as “sickly and a little emotional” largely due to Osby’s vocal performance on the track. A focal point for the song that each member was sure to note was the fact that they spent a ton of time trying to refine it to convey the exact emotions and feelings that they intended.
As for the band’s future, their main hope is to do a headline tour of the United States in 2023. At the same time, the band has already begun thinking about themes and general points to hit with their new album, all of which will be captured once the band gets “to that phase of [their] lives.” These two talented artists don’t limit themselves just to their group work though, as they are also each working on solo projects that audiences can expect to release within the next year.
Right now though, the band is wrapping up their U.S. tour as the opener for indie artist Beabadoobee. Weinberg, who was actually born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is particularly excited for the final stop of the tour, at Roadrunner in Boston. With the ambition this band clearly has, it is almost certain that they will be making waves across the country with listeners who not only resonate with where the band is at currently, but crave their evolving style and tones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the temperature drops, more and more students are abandoning the lounge chairs in Harvard Yard and the sunny, sprawling steps of Widener Library to return to their favorite indoor study spaces on campus. Often prioritizing sunlight (whenever possible) and aesthetically pleasing locations, students recently told the Harvard Crimson about their favorite places on campus.
Frequenting the Harvard Art Museums courtyard for a class, Sahana Narayan, a first-year Masters student in the Media, Medicine, and Health Program, started going to the Harvard Art Museum’s courtyard to study.
“I love the open layout of this lobby area because it’s aesthetic, but it’s also, you know, not too quiet,” said Narayan. “I don’t like studying in libraries too much because it’s always too quiet. And I like the fact that it’s pretty. It’s in a good location on campus; It’s close to other things.”
The popularity for the museum courtyard was clear when Ramya Chunduri, another first-year Masters student in the Media, Medicine, and Health Program, noted its perks as well.
“I like the proximity to the café, and I like that there are people in the morning, but then there are times when there’s no one here,” Chunduri said. “And, I really like the architecture, it’s pretty to look at, and I can take breaks and go look around the museum, so that’s always fun.”
The Harvard Art Museum Courtyard, also known as the Calderwood Courtyard, was built in the 1920s, replicating a villa in Tuscany, and it is part of the original museum’s structure. More so, the courtyard was built with travertine stone, the same stone used in the villa on which it was modeled, imported from Italy.
Another place on campus that gathers lots of attention for its design, architecture, and environment is Widener Library. From the cavernous stacks to the grand reading room, Widener has much to offer students who want a quiet space to work.
“I really like coming to Widener during the day because of the sunlight that comes in,” said undergraduate Stephanie Sanjines ‘23.
Again, natural lighting seems to be highly prioritized by Harvard students, especially as the sky darkens and winter returns. In keeping with the affinity for a well-lit and sharply designed space, another popular study space on campus, known for its design and atmosphere, is the Smith Campus Center.
“I’d say I like Smith because there’s a bit of noise, and yet, it’s a space for concentration. Personally, I don’t like spaces that are completely silent, like Widener, which I know a lot of people like, but not Smith –– so that’s like a personal preference for me,” said Rabsa Sikter ’24. “I like the architecture style, and you get sunlight. Just the environmental vibes, I guess.”
Many other students, it seems, also enjoy the Smith Campus Center. Quentin Aufort, a visiting student in the class of 2024, enjoys the relaxed atmosphere of the 10th floor, a modern, student-only space with couches, coffee tables, and pool tables.
“Well, I love Smith because you can basically work and chill at the same time. Like, you have some pretty nice couches, also some pool tables. I’m just with my friends, when I’m tired of studying, and just go play some pool, and, yeah, just to relax also,” said Aufort.
Also on the 10th floor of the Smith Campus Center, Emily Parke ’24 said, “I like the natural lighting, obviously, I mean right now it’s a little rainy, but I mean I like working up here too. I’m not sure if it’s the most aesthetically pleasing place, but I do like the windows. I definitely need some natural lighting. And, I like places a little more quiet, I guess, than on the rowdy side.”
In addition to the well-known study spaces, like the Harvard Art Museums Courtyard, Widener Library, and the Smith Campus Center, many students seek refuge from the winter chill in less-crowded, more eclectic study spaces that offer an equally enchanting atmosphere.
“Very few people know about it, but the Business School Chapel is really beautiful. It has a greenhouse and koi fish, and it’s just very peaceful and meditative. And that’s one of the most aesthetic places on campus,” said Zazie Huml ’25. “I think that the Quad is underrated… And Cabot’s dining hall with the glass walls is just very nice… I like the art, I like the trees, I like it especially in the fall when it turns a lot of colors.”
“Oh, and also,” said Huml, “the Harvard Arboretum is a piece of land that they [Harvard University] own and it’s just like full of trees.”
With an emphasis on nature, peacefulness, and natural lighting, students seem to be drawn to the more meditative and peaceful Harvard spaces.
Reiterating the love for natural lighting, Sikter said, “I also like the Education School Library… it’s really very well lit. I think I personally like well-lit spaces.”
“There’s the EPS Lounge… the room there is beautiful. It has a really nice view of a courtyard in front of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. There’s a piano in the room and there’s just a globe, and it’s really pretty,” said Parke. “I guess I like places that have an academia vibe, but I don’t like places that are super dark. I’m not actually a big library studier… but, I mean if I did have to pick a library space: the Poetry Room, in Lamont, is very nice.”
Overall, the priority on light, atmosphere, and the right type of study environment defines students’ perceptions of spaces on campus. Unsurprisingly, modern spaces and academic environments come out on top, with some more niche and eclectic spaces thrown into the mix as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember getting my first pair of Off-White shoes. My family and I were visiting New York City for the first time, and Virgil Abloh had just finished organizing his first fashion show as the Men’s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton in 2018. That time period was magical for me, and so I clearly remember begging my parents for — and getting — my first pair of Off-White Vulc Low Top sneakers.
Virgil Abloh, who died of cancer a little over a year ago on Nov. 28, was a multi-talented artist, fashion designer, and founder of the famous fashion brand Off-White. But before he became the superstar creator he’s known as today, he was an ordinary kid from Rockford, Illinois. After earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he then received his Master of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. While getting a formal education, he still designed clothes and t-shirts.
When I watched Abloh's first Louis Vuitton fashion show in 2018 on a live stream, nothing else mattered to me except being able to see a Black man — someone who looked like me — on my laptop as the head of one of the largest and most influential fashion houses in the world. Abloh’s show, which drew inspiration from “The Wizard of Oz,” created a new world filled with vibrant colors and Black culture, which has often been excluded or exploited by fashion houses.
Abloh not only created a unique space within Off-White and Louis Vuitton, but he also created a new world for young Black creatives.
For many, Abloh was a primary influence on their childhood and teenage years. Few other artists could flawlessly navigate through so many mediums of art. He left a mark not just through his role as the art director for “Yeezus” and “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” but he also designed Kanye and Jay-Z’s “Watch the Throne” collaborative album, Contributed to projects including Nike “The 10,” and had multiple museum exhibits across America. Crucially, his impact also extended outside of art through projects like his partnership with UNICEF.
Looking back at videos preceding Abloh’s unfortunate death is devastating, but his strength in continuing to host talks and provide people with his insight despite a cancer diagnosis is emblematic of Abloh as a man. He was always dedicated to democratizing fashion and opening it up for more diverse people to enter.
Unfortunately, Abloh’s death was the second recent death of a high-profile Black man due to cancer; actor Chadwick Boseman passed away from colon cancer in August 2020. Both Boseman and Abloh were well-known Black men at the top of their respective professions when they passed, and the deaths of both inspired conversations about Blackness, the current healthcare system, and disability.
Blackness and disability are often seen as two distinct identities. One can either be Black, or one can be disabled, but not both because current normative discourse around disability is viewed through the lens of whiteness. Abloh and Boseman chose not to disclose their diagnoses not just for their privacies it was also due to the stigma around Black people with disabilities and illnesses.
Black-disabled representation within the public sphere is almost non-existent. Disabled people are treated as disposable and not needing or deserving of care. There were many instances where people would comment on Chadwick Boseman’s weight or look without truly knowing what he was dealing with. This however is emblematic not just of individuals but of institutional structures writ large. Our society runs on work and production. Capitalism cannot function any other way, and because of it, people are treated poorly as laborers, and not viewed as human beings who deserve adequate rest and care. What’s heartening, though, is that while struggling with their health as Abloh and Boseman struggled with their cancer, they continued to do the things that they loved until their passing.
Abloh changed the world, and his presence is sorely missed. Watching the Met Gala last May, many missed seeing Abloh and his designs on the red carpet. Abloh changed the world of fashion. He was a part of the generation of artists and designers that merged streetwear and high fashion, and the world continues to feel the impact he made on the numerous art mediums that he touched.

“How does it make sense — that the ancestors would give me gifts and skills to save my brother, but I couldn’t?”
Such is the all-important question Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright) poses to Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) near the midpoint of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” Despite being a brilliant scientist and having access to the most advanced technology in the world, Shuri is unable to prevent the death of her older brother, T’Challa, a character made famous by the late Chadwick Boseman in “Black Panther.” Following Boseman’s tragic passing in August 2020, it became clear that this sequel would need to address the situation in an inevitably painful way. “Wakanda Forever” hence sets the heavy tone early, including a moving funeral for T’Challa, as well as a tear-jerking alteration of the Marvel Studios title sequence featuring clips only of Boseman, shining light on his many contributions to films through the years.
As for the continuing story of “Wakanda Forever,” the central conflict is predicated on the weakened state in which Wakanda finds itself following T’Challa’s death. The nation, which is known to be the only one on Earth that has access to a rare metal called vibranium, faces increased scrutiny for not sharing its resources. It is also threatened by the underwater civilization of Talokan, which is revealed to possess vibranium as well and fears that Wakanda’s actions may jeopardize its survival.
“Wakanda Forever” excels in all the same ways as its predecessor, as it features a compelling villain in Namor, offers exceptional world-building, and boasts powerful visuals. At two hours and 41 minutes, the film does become slightly bloated and therefore struggles to tie up all of its loose ends. However, slight shortcomings in the story are outshone by an emotional thesis that places T’Challa’s core principles at the center of Shuri’s journey, making the film a worthy tribute to T’Challa as a character and to the talented human who brought him to life.
One of the most fascinating elements of “Wakanda Forever” is the introduction of Namor, the King of Talokan. Among a civilization of humanoid aquatic creatures born from a Mayan tribe’s experimentation with a mystical concoction, Namor uniquely possesses super strength and winged ankles that allow him to fly. His people hence call him “K’uk’ulkan,” or “the feather serpent god.” This lore lays the groundwork for excellent world-building, as Talokan revolves around Namor in a way that is analogous to how the first film establishes the Black Panther as the heart of Wakandan culture. Namor justifies this significance through his driving desire to protect his people from oppressive surface civilizations.
He is also a ton of fun to watch in combat; adorned in vibranium armor and wielding a gleaming golden spear, he powerfully bounds through the sky as if running on air, often single-handedly disposing of entire warships. Namor’s robust character development draws sympathy but the threat he poses to Wakanda spurs fear, giving Talokan a nuanced position in the story as the film progresses.
The clash of cultures central to the film is repeatedly defined by stunning visuals. One of the clearest examples occurs when Namor takes Shuri to Talokan and reveals it to be a complex city covered in vibranium, as if the futuristic architecture of Wakanda had been dragged under water. Reversing the nature of this juxtaposition, during a fight sequence that occurs in Wakanda, Namor unloads water bombs that shatter the windows of the Wakandan throne room. What follows is a beautiful slow motion shot in which the throne is fully engulfed by a sea of white, showing just how much the civilization of submariners threatens the power structure once held strong by T’Challa. One more instance of this contrast comes in the final battle, when a Wakandan group of women soldiers known as the Dora Milaje, dressed in bright orange, uniformly leaps towards the turquoise seawater to face warriors from Talokan. The film is strong in its visual representations of the conflict between nations, which only adds to the weight of this conflict as the film nears its climax.
Before it can get to this point, though, it becomes clear that the story could have been more complex had it leaned into an early indication that other world powers would also intervene in Wakanda. Namor alludes to this in a conversation with Shuri; he had previously overheard her talking of wanting to “burn the world,” so he says, “let us burn it together,” implying the potential for a plotline involving the nations’ different approaches to handling foreign intervention. However, after Namor leads an attack on Wakanda that results in a tragic death, the story loses its focus on this element and becomes centered on Shuri’s quest for vengeance.
Misplaced focus becomes a pattern more generally, as well. For instance, the film spends an excessive amount of time on new character Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), who isn’t fully integral to the main story, while it doesn’t spend nearly enough time on a potential redemption arc for returning character Okoye (Danai Gurira), nor on the trauma of Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o), T’Challa’s former girlfriend. “Wakanda Forever” does become rather bloated at points, the completion of Shuri’s journey is executed extremely well in the end, which is undoubtedly most important.
“Wakanda Forever” is at its best when it synthesizes Shuri’s sympathies for Talokan with T’Challa’s penchant for nobility. At the film’s climax, the prior world-building of Talokan, as well as its juxtaposition with Wakanda, becomes instrumental to the story’s success. As Shuri considers a bold set of choices, there is a touching montage that illustrates her realization of the similarities between Wakanda and Talokan, both in the simple joys their people experience in their daily lives and the treacheries of oppression they’ve each faced. She then tells Namor, “vengeance has consumed us … we cannot let it consume our people,” in a line of dialogue nearly identical to one uttered by T’Challa in his first appearance, in 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War.” Shuri’s decision is thus both motivated by her own empathetic experiences and empowered by T'Challa's ideals, showcasing the film’s beautiful ability to unite these two entities.
Ultimately, despite missing some opportunities in the larger scope of its story, “Wakanda Forever” is a wondrous tale of colliding cultures that provides emotional closure to the character of T’Challa. In regard to the result of Shuri’s journey, Namor perhaps puts it best: “Only the most broken people can be great leaders.”
By the film’s final scene, though, it appears that Shuri is picking up the pieces, as she sits on the beach and fully comes to terms with her brother’s passing. However, a surprise element of this progression then comes into play, as Nakia joins her and introduces a boy whom she reveals to be her and T’Challa’s son. Shuri is left in disbelief, which then clearly gives way to joy. In the end, through these characters’ love for T’Challa, through the moving performance of Letitia Wright as Shuri, and through the memory of the great Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther will live on.

For Kathryn R. “Katie” McClanan ’22, writing is a practice that draws on her physical body to stimulate the spiritual. She speaks from experience. Creating her senior thesis play “Sexy Girls and A Fish Contemplate Impermanence” was a spiritual journey in and of itself, involving a month in a Zen buddhist monastery and two months farming in different parts of the world.
The play is keenly aware of its spirituality and the culture that informs its creation. In the stage directions, McClanan makes it clear that actors should not pretend to meditate onstage. “They meditate onstage. These moments should also be guided by the Buddhist advisors,” she wrote. This reverence comes from McClanan’s own interactions with Buddhism. While she does not self-identify as a Buddhist, she engages in a variety of Buddhist practices including daily meditation, chanting, and prayer.
“My positionality as a white woman in that culture is super complex. It feels weird to me to put that label on myself, especially as a white girl who’s raised in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, with two Presbyterian parents,” she said.
“Ultimately this play was inspired by a spiritual journey that I went on. But as I created the play, the writing of the play itself also became integral in that spiritual journey, just writing as a means of making sense of my own experience,” she said. Thus, by approaching writing as a spiritual practice rather than as an intellectual exercise, McClanan wrote a play that she describes as more truthful and candid.
“I came in with the expectation that I wanted to write a very philosophical and spiritual piece of academic work. I was looking at Camus and Satre, all these playwrights who had written these dense allegorical texts,” she said. “Once I let go of that image of what I wanted my play to be, it ended up being way more centered around topics that are more raw and rich for me.” For McClanan, that topic was the “relationship between spirituality and romantic love.”
However, her thesis play is more than just a result of her spiritual journey: It is a product of her journey at Harvard as well. Initially trained as an actor and heavily involved in theater, McClanan was inclined to choose dramatic conservatories over Harvard. But she explained that being an actor meant having to mold herself into specific roles in order to get cast, something that was detrimental to her mental health in the long run.
At Harvard, she serendipitously discovered the Theater, Dance, and Media (TDM) concentration. She credits the explorative nature of the department with helping her discover her potential as a writer and director. It allowed her to gauge her internal compass and tap into her own creative agency, prompting her to reevaluate her whole identity.
“I think that TDM is one of the very few academic disciplines that really values embodied knowledge and experiential living,” she said. “I feel so lucky that so much of my college education has been on my feet in studios creating cool work that is recognizing my whole experience as a person: my body, my emotions.”
Leaving TDM with a stronger voice as an artist and a human being, McClanan is optimistic about life after graduation in December. She plans to spend the next six months doing residencies and apprenticeships in different monasteries and ashrams.
“I know that that’s what I’m feeling called to do. That’s a way that I feel like I’ll come into better contact with my own consciousness and my experiences and be able to live a more intentional life from here on out,” she said.
Afterwards, she plans to move to Chicago to start a job in creative brand strategy. Although this change of direction might seem jarring, it is a well-thought through decision. She noted that she values security, stability, and the ability to support herself.
“I feel really confident that I’m going to wind my way back to something that is more purely creative after this year,” she said. “But now I’m feeling really happy to get my feet under me as I graduate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are certain moments in our lives that accrue meaning retroactively, exerting a stubborn gravitational pull even as we forge ahead. It is these moments that guide Hua Hsu’s precise, penetrating memoir “Stay True,” an account of growing up in 1980s America and experiencing the death of a close friend. Hsu is not interested in conscribing himself to a single genre; at once a eulogy and a bildungsroman, a homage and a work of autotheory, the book is a layered form of searching.
Hsu does not tell his reader what he is looking for; it is quite possible he himself cannot put a name to it either. Through precise ruminations on friendship and loss — ones all the more potent because of their rich historical grounding — Hsu illuminates at once the lingering ends and new beginnings that follow loss.
“There are many currencies to friendship,” Hsu writes early in his memoir. “Some friends complete us, while others complicate us.” His reflection is a cogent analysis of what happens when an easygoing, ever-inquisitive peer named Ken walks into his life. Readers meet Hsu, a college student at UC Berkeley, similar to how they may have been during that time in their lives: eager to become themselves, but unsure of what that means. In the coming years, Ken becomes at once a confidante and a foil, someone Hsu leans on and measures himself against as he attempts to articulate his identity. Particularly delightful is the way Hsu melds popular culture with literary theory, not dissimilar to how a real college experience transpires. His prose is infused with references to Kurt Cobain and Jacques Derrida, Pearl Jam and Aristotle, resulting in a synthetic framework that captures the heady intellectual growth of his college years.
Hsu’s period of dynamic discovery alongside Ken comes to an abrupt end when he and his friends receive a harrowing call early one morning: Ken, walking in the early hours of dawn alone from a party, was robbed and shot dead. The event uproots the stability and fellowship Hsu had developed with his friends in the months before. His college years, which had been defined by an enterprising intellectualism — a desire to find patterns and answers — is replaced by a deafening absence that defies logic. Hsu’s prose unearths with aching candor the difficulty of moving past a tragedy that seems at once disorienting and deeply unfair.
It is after this event that “Stay True” turns inward to meditate on the purpose of its own prose — and of writing at large — in addressing the aftermath of grief. “I became obsessed with the possibility of a sentence that could wend its way backward,” Hsu writes. “I picked up a pen and tried to write myself into the past.” It is with this understated yet forceful revelation with which Hsu’s memoir comes to a close — to grieve means to bend time. Ken’s death does not curtail Hsu’s dialogue with his beloved friend; instead, it enlarges and complicates it.
“I wrote out of a sense of responsibility for our past,” Hsu writes. Indeed, Ken becomes a part of Hsu. It is through this intimate post-mortem embrace that the memoir — and, by extension, Hsu himself — is able to achieve what seems impossible: to hold the departed close while also letting them go.

Divorced, Beheaded, Died; Divorced, Beheaded, Survived. The famous rhyme takes on a new life as the basis of “Six,” a musical reimagining of the six wives of King Henry VIII as they battle to emerge as the leader of a new pop girl group. Upending the conventional theatergoing experience, the queens of “Six” took the stage at Boston’s Emerson Colonial Theatre on Nov. 16 for a dazzling, but ultimately superficial, celebration of female empowerment.
“Six” forgoes the traditional musical format and is instead staged as a pop concert for the new and aptly named group “Six,” made up of the six ex-wives of Henry VIII. The queens immediately break the fourth wall, informing the audience that they will be tasked with determining which one of them has the most tragic backstory and will therefore be named leader of the new girl group. From there, the queens take turns performing musical numbers telling their tragic backstories and making their case to become the group’s star.
The first queen to tell her story, Catherine of Aragon (Khaila Wilcoxon) serves as the sextet’s de facto leader after singing the jealousy-tinged anthem “No Way.” The spunky Anne Boleyn (Storm Lever) follows with the fan-favorite “Don’t Lose Ur Head” before Jane Seymour (Jasmine Forsberg) delivers the sole somber moment of the show with the power-ballad “Heart of Stone.” Anna of Cleves (Olivia Donalson) performs the most genuine display of feminism in the show, reclaiming her freedom during “Get Down.” While Katherine Howard (Didi Romero) and Catherine Parr (Gabriela Carrilo) round out the sextet with “All You Want To Do” and “I Don’t Need Your Love.” The final track leads the queens to abandon their competition and reclaim their stories, rewriting their histories as happy endings.
If you’ve spent any time on TikTok in the last two years, you’ve heard the music of “Six.” Clips from “Don’t Lose Ur Head,” “All You Want To Do,” and “Haus of Holbein” have all been used in hundreds of thousands of TikTok videos and can easily be mistaken for hits from your favorite female pop stars. With a runtime under 90 minutes and no intermission, the musical consists of just nine songs. But with each track bringing a distinct and catchy pop sound, there's still plenty of crowd pleasers to entertain throughout.
The surprise stunner of the show was Jasmine Forsberg as Jane Seymor. Forsberg faced an uphill battle in winning over the audience. While the other five queens are given flashy dance numbers, spunky personalities, and intricate stage production during their solo numbers, Jane Seymor is pigeon-holed as the boring queen. “Heart of Stone” is the only ballad in the musical and could easily be an energetic low. Couple that with her comparatively plain costume, less tragic backstory, and simple staging, and Jane Seymour is set-up to be the most lackluster queen. Yet despite the odds stacked against her, Forsberg delivers a show-stopping vocal performance earning the biggest and longest applause of the night.
With a solid tracklist and intriguing premise, “Six” has the potential to bring something fresh and new to the theater-going experience. The short, concert-based format creates a unique and interactive viewing experience and opens up Broadway to new audiences. The songs are modern, catchy, and upbeat, with a heartwarming and kid-friendly message of female empowerment.
But it’s a message that fails to penetrate past the show's soaring vocals, bright lights, and dazzling costumes. As audience members flooded out of the Emerson Colonial Theatre, more than one could be overheard asking “Which was your favorite Queen?” even after a 90 minute story showing that such contests are meaningless and harmful.
Moreover, the show’s message leaves no room for subtlety, nuance, or complexity. The dialogue in the show is sparse, but the limited lines can be cringe-inducing and dated even just five years after the show’s creation. From the repeated and unironic use of “Her-story” in place of history to the insistence on constantly referring to each other as “Queens,” the portrayal of feminism in the show paints the characters as feminist caricatures rather than actual feminist icons.
Even packaged in the heavy-handed delivery of pop-princess feminism anthems, “Six” isn’t without its problematic portrayal of women. The infantilization of Anne Boleyn as a chronically online preteen that sings about how she seduced Henry VIII is uncomfortable at best. But the discomfort of Anne Boleyn’s characterization pales in comparison to the treatment of Katherine Howard. The adoring sound of audience cheers and shouts filling the theater following her performance of “All You Want To Do” borders on dystopian, after the song packages years of emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of men into an upbeat dance number.
Lacking any real depth in it’s feminist message, “Six” is a show best enjoyed at the surface level, where dazzling costumes and impressive vocal performances overshadow the story’s superficial foundation.

“Dot” finds its voice in simplicity. The latest poetry collection from Pulitzer Prize finalist Ron Padgett imbues the mundane with whimsy, treating the human experience with a fantastical salve of literary and poetic devices. Language, coming-of-age narratives, relationships, loss, and even grief are folded into the foray of everyday encounters with an almost otherworldly twist. Padgett takes great care of the little things, portraying normal life — including incredible highs and devastating lows — with a thoughtful and magical lens, creating a quick read that is sure to put a smile on any reader’s face.
Bright and imaginative verse and prose can too often become disjointed in their otherworldliness; “Dot” deftly circumvents this pitfall, with cohesive themes and repetitive motifs throughout the collection. While the subject matter hops from Padgett’s frustrations with the spelling of “forty” to keeping mice out of a room to the loss of his mother, his consistent stylistic choices keep the book grounded without stifling his creative freedom. Common fantastical imagery rings true in each separate work. He plays with size, for example, in “At Benny the Bungalow,” where “the sandwich started to grow bigger and bigger,” and in “Geometry of the Sandwich,” where he laments the difference of slices in a sandwich to be “so small as to be useless in the great rush of life.” Simultaneously, the observable world anchors Padgett’s whimsy, finding comfort in earthy, yet not necessarily natural experiences like “a bird opening its breast to air” or “my face … mashed into wet concrete.” Even the title itself creates a cohesive motif: Much like a small dot on a large canvas, “Dot” enhances the smallest moments with a sort of reverent fantasy — no experience is too small or too mundane.
Structurally, "Dot" is equally immersive. The prosaic, free-verse style of much of the collection at times resembles spoken word, and plays a key role in developing the overarching themes of dissecting and appreciating everyday events, providing a structural parallel to the subject matter of the poems. Even through the illusion of more traditional poetic style, like in “Sonnet (Thunk),” which is in sonnet form, complete with the characteristic “volta,” the poetry remains grounded in its down-to-earth, free style. This departure from the structural norm further glorifies the mundanities of day to day existence, while providing refreshing variety to the collection. Padgett takes this breath of life one step further with interesting and exciting variability in the length of the poems, as well as interspersed passages of prose that create a dynamic pace when paired with the already quite prosaic poetry that fills the pages. Though the work is comforting, it’s an ode, not a lullaby — this read is a page turner.
The real magic of the collection stems from its ability to fully immerse the reader in a fantastical yet familiar world; sometimes, however, this suspension of disbelief is challenged. Nearly insurmountable quantities of allusions don’t allow the reader too much leisure; periodically, an unfamiliar name or reference requires an explanation outside the material. This cycle of “read, research, repeat” can get exhausting for many, though the trudge is worth it to experience the world of words that Padgett creates between these brightly-colored covers.
“Dot” provides a fulfilling and immersive experience from cover to cover and somehow still manages to leave readers wanting more. The unique combination of the intrigue of fantasy and the relatability of the unexceptional creates a poetic experience that enraptures, perplexes, and amuses. Padgett finds the innate beauty in every otherwise forgettable experience, which culminates in a wonderfully human collection with a convincing message to take life slow and appreciate the depth of emotion to be found in the little things.

In the hustle of their daily commutes, most of those who pass by Cambridge’s Christ Church do so without a second glance. The average passerby has no idea there is a tomb in the basement holding the remains of a formerly enslaved person. His name was Darby Vassall. Vassall chose to be buried at the church, though no one knows the reason why.
Founded in 1759 and located at Zero Garden Street in Harvard Square, Christ Church has been deeply ingrained in the Cambridge community for centuries, with generations of Harvard students and towering figures like George Washington passing through its doors. Despite its lasting presence in the area, most people are unaware of the tomb concealed in the church’s basement. Nicole Piepenbrink, who graduated from Harvard Graduate School of Design in spring of 2022, wants that hidden history to come to light. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Piepenbrink described how her film “HERE LIES DARBY VASSALL” aims to achieve that goal.
“HERE LIES DARBY VASSALL” is an 11-minute short film that was projected on loop on an 8-foot high by 29-foot long curved screen outside of Christ Church every evening from Oct. 12 to Nov. 6. It is part of the church’s broader commitment to racial justice, which includes efforts to reckon with the institution’s ties to slavery. Piepenbrink’s film offers biographical information on Darby Vassall and his connection to the church in the form of a voiceover, with key words from the narration displayed on the screen. The text is overlaid on a video of people slowly walking into the basement of the church and encircling the tomb in the center of the space. A song inspired by a hymn plays in the background, with the lyrics, “Oh mighty God, from you no secrets are hid.”
Piepenbrink, who describes herself as a multidisciplinary designer, began working on “HERE LIES DARBY VASSALL” as her thesis project at the Graduate School of Design. The project arose from her investigations into the church’s history.
“A lot of my research involved following the money,” she said. “So looking at transactions and sources of wealth in white colonial families that were giving money to Christ Church. But that research was juxtaposed with this tomb, and specifically Darby Vassall’s presence in the tomb. It was kind of like the history of slavery was so evident in the story of this site, in this church in this parish, but it was nowhere to be found, nowhere to be seen.”
Working with her advisers, Piepebrink realized the story of the tomb had to become the core of her project. “So the question for us became: How does this repressed narrative — and the tomb — how does it come above ground, become visible, become accessible to the public, and become known?”
Her film was the answer to that question. Most people — even most parishioners — have no easy access to the basement of the church, Piepenbrink explained.
“It’s just so symbolic of so many things, right. It’s underneath the ground, the public can’t access it,” she said. “It’s just been treated like a receptacle for stuff like most basements… not like a sacred space, or not respected at all, really.”
Piepenbrink’s film brings Darby Vassall’s often overlooked story to the public eye.
It begins by stating that he was born on May 16, 1769 and died on Oct. 12, 1861, and identifies him as a son, brother, husband, father, co-founder of the African Society, property owner, and activist. Narrator Timothy Joseph goes on to explain that the proprietor of the church, Henry Vassall, who was described by Darby as a “very wicked man,” purchased Darby’s father Tony from Jamaica. Henry paid 13 pounds, six shillings, and eight pence in Jamaican currency for a church pew; in an inventory of Henry’s belongings, Tony is estimated to be worth the same amount as a church pew.
Contrasting the presentation of these stark and chilling facts is the video of people — including parishioners and even Darby Vassall’s descendants — standing around the tomb in a moment of reverence. Piepenbrink said that she was especially grateful to have worked alongside Darby’s living descendents, including Dennis Lloyd and his daughter Egypt Lloyd, who founded the Slave Legacy History Coalition.
Notably, “HERE LIES DARBY VASSALL” was an outdoor, highly visible public installation, difficult for any Harvard Square passerby to ignore — an intentional choice.
“History doesn’t end at the border of Christ Church’s grass,” Piepenbrink said. “It is connected with the history of its immediate context and broader context. So it’s really trying to connect the site to external geographies like Jamaica and Antigua. This is really a story about the parish and beyond. It only made sense, I think, for it to be public.”
Piepenbrink noted that the film isn’t meant to offer people neat answers.
“I really wanted it to start up a process of thinking and reflecting and engaging and communicating — to sort of ignite change, ignite movement, ignite something,” she said.
She also acknowledged that each individual viewer has a unique take away from the film. “If someone has questions and they want to know more, it’s a win,” she said.
In addition to providing a historical education, Piepenbrink wanted the film to emotionally resonate with people.
“I wanted it to enter the head. But then with the music, and the visuals, I really wanted it also to enter the heart.”
“HERE LIES DARBY VASSALL” can be watched online through the project’s website hereliesdarbyvassall.art.

BOSTON — Federal prosecutors on Monday told a jury that Harvard’s former longtime fencing coach, Peter Brand, leveraged his team’s recruiting spots for more than $1.5 million in bribes from a wealthy Maryland businessman who was desperate to get his sons admitted to the College.
Brand was struggling to pay his bills in the early 2010s when he was connected with Jie “Jack” Zhao, prosecutors said during the first day of a federal trial in which the two men face bribery charges.
“As if by magic, someone began making his bills disappear, one by one,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian Stearns told jurors in his opening statement. “That person paid off his loans and college tuition for his son.”
“Who paid for all those bills for Peter and why? The answer is sitting right there,” Stearns said, pointing toward Zhao, who sat stoically behind the defense table in a courtroom at the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse in downtown Boston.
Brand and Zhao were arrested in 2020 and later indicted by a grand jury on bribery charges. As part of the bribery scheme, prosecutors say, Zhao bought Brand’s home for almost twice its market value, paid off the coach’s loans, and covered his son’s college tuition.
A defense attorney for Brand, who was fired by Harvard in 2019, painted a starkly different picture during his opening statement Monday, telling jurors that the government has “chased newspaper headlines, rushed to judgment, and ignored all the facts.”
Lawyers for Brand and Zhao told jurors that Zhao’s two sons, Eric Y. Zhao ’18 and Edward Y. Zhao ’21, were accepted to Harvard on their own merits. The boys “checked off every box imaginable,” said Douglas Brooks, Brand’s attorney.
The defense attorneys also rejected prosecutors’ bribery allegations.
“This is a friend loaning a friend money,” Brooks said of the payments Zhao made on Brand’s behalf between 2012 and 2015, adding that they were all later repaid with interest.
Following opening statements, a key government witness, Alexandre Ryjik, who coached Zhao’s sons at a Virginia-based fencing academy he founded in 1991, told jurors he acted as the middleman between Zhao and Brand in the bribery scheme.
Defense attorneys painted Ryjik as a liar and an unreliable witness who is cooperating with prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability.
“Ryjik is a thief, a cheat, and a liar, and the government knows it,” said Brooks, Brand’s attorney.
In his testimony, Ryjik admitted to paying off personal expenses with his fencing academy’s credit card, misrepresenting his fencing credentials on the academy’s website, and unintentionally underreporting its revenue on federal loan applications.
“He’s got a free ride thanks to the government, and he’s trying to take that baby all the way home here to trial,” Michael Packard, an attorney for Zhao, told jurors. “He will lie to you.”
Prosecutors say Ryjik helped carry out the bribery scheme. The Soviet-born fencing instructor arranged for Zhao to donate $1 million to his nonprofit, a sum he planned to direct to a foundation run by Brand. Only $100,000 was ultimately transferred between the two sides.
Ryjik testified that Zhao told him “more than once” his sons’ admission to Harvard “would be worth a million dollars” to him. At the time, Ryjik did not take the comments seriously, he said.
Brand wrote in a 2012 text message to Zhao that Zhao’s “boys don’t have to be great fencers. All I need is a good incentive to recruit them[.] You can tell him that[.]”
Ryjik testified that he and Brand discussed the idea of exchanging money for recruiting spots at a dinner in California during the United States Fencing Association National Championships in the summer of 2012.
Ryjik said Brand told him “he wanted his future to be secure,” offering to recruit Zhao’s sons in exchange for payment.
Ryjik and Zhao developed an escrow agreement that would direct $500,000 to Ryjik when each of Zhao’s sons were admitted to Harvard, Ryjik testified. Ryjik said the agreement was designed “so it looks like money goes to me,” while it was in fact intended for Brand. He told jurors that he and Zhao “discussed different ways to get the money to Peter Brand,” ultimately settling on moving the money through Ryjik’s tax-exempt foundation to one Brand would set up.
In 2013, four days after Zhao informed Brand via email that his oldest son planned to apply to Harvard College, Zhao made a $1 million donation to Ryjik’s nonprofit, the National Fencing Foundation.
Ryjik testified that Brand had told him by that point he would recruit his son in exchange for payment.
Packard, Zhao’s lawyer, said Zhao’s donation was simply a gift to Ryjik’s foundation.
“Jack Zhao’s donation to the NFF was just that: a donation,” he said.
Prosecutors presented Harvard documents Brand signed declaring outside income sources and agreeing to the school’s conflict of interest policies.
“The evidence will show that Peter Brand lied to Harvard,” said Stearns, the assistant U.S. attorney. “He had to for this thing to work.”
“That’s what this case is about: a stream of bribes solicited and accepted by a college coach in exchange for recruiting two students,” Stearns added. “Until they got caught, Peter Brand got fired, and the scheme unraveled.”
The trial is set to resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A routine tackle left Ben Abercrombie ’21-’23 paralyzed from the neck down. But five years later, Abercrombie is slowly but surely making progress, with a wide coalition of allies by his side.
That coalition includes his parents, Marty and Sherri, who live with him in his Winthrop House suite, his teammates, as well as an unlikely source — El Jefe’s Taqueria. On Tuesday, El Jefe’s will host the 5th Annual Ben Abercrombie Day fundraiser, with all sales between 8 a.m. and 4 a.m. going toward the Benson M. Abercrombie ’21 Fund, founded by the Harvard Varsity Club to finance Abercrombie’s rehabilitation and travel to and from his home in Alabama.
When he arrived on campus for his freshman fall in 2017, Abercrombie was like any other student athlete. But in that year’s season opener against Rhode Island, the defensive back’s life was altered forever. Although the hit looked benign at first, it quickly became clear to veteran head coach Tim Murphy that the consequences would be severe.
“I’ll never forget it,” Murphy said. “I knew immediately, as anyone who was right there, because it just happened to be directly in front of me on the sideline … but I knew immediately, just intuitively, this was something very, very serious.”
Abercrombie had come out of Hoover High School in Alabama as a touted prospect. At Hoover, he was part of three state championship teams across football and baseball, and those Buccaneers football teams were close-knit squads anchored by a fierce defense. Abercrombie started at safety his junior and senior years, and he was named to the All-State First Team after his senior year.
“We hated to let teams score,” Abercrombie said about the Hoover defenses. “We were trying to get a shutout every game, basically.”
When he came to Massachusetts on a recruiting visit, Murphy and several other recruits made an early impression on him. One fellow Alabamian, safety Tanner Lee ’17, gave Abercrombie the nickname “The Badger” for his tenacious play and his resemblance on the field to Tyrann Mathieu, the former LSU defensive standout who currently plays for the New Orleans Saints. Lee and other veteran players like Raishaun McGee ’17 later became some of Abercrombie’s early mentors on the team.
Throughout Murphy’s 28 seasons as Harvard’s head coach, one of his top priorities has been to develop bonds between players, making sure all freshmen have an upperclassman mentor. The unassailable community the Crimson program has forged was evident in the hours after Abercrombie’s injury. Instead of traveling back to Cambridge with the team, Murphy and his wife stayed with the safety into the early hours of the morning at Providence Hospital.
“I actually had a chance to speak with Ben just as he was being wheeled into emergency surgery,” Murphy recalled. “I had the chance to let him know that we were here for him.”
The first month after his injury, which he spent in the hospital, presented tremendous challenges. He suffered from pneumonia, as patients recovering from traumatic spinal cord injuries typically struggle with temperature regulation. Listed at 175 pounds entering his freshman season, he lost nearly all of his muscle mass in the hospital, dropping to 130. He also had to re-learn basic functions, such as eating, speaking, and drinking.
At that point, Marty recalled, the family’s focus was on survival — getting Abercrombie accustomed to breathing with a ventilator, for instance, and teaching his family how to attend to his needs, as he required someone to be with him 24/7. One of Abercrombie’s early strides was regaining the ability to eat normally, which he celebrated with a meal from a Mexican restaurant with a speech therapist who had been working with him.
Throughout these early days, he had the support of several teammates and Harvard football alumni. Shortly after his injury, Harvard Athletics released a video of several players vowing to dedicate the season to him. Additionally, in a 26-20 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 3, 2017, two members of the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers — tight end Cameron Brate ’14 and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 — wore cleats dedicated to Abercrombie as part of the league’s “My Cause, My Cleats” campaign. Fitzpatrick even sent his shoes to Abercrombie after the game.
Former Harvard players showing their support for the safety has been commonplace since his injury. An alumnus whom Abercrombie had never met before came to visit him at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, a specialized hospital focused on brain and spinal cord injuries, where he was transferred after his month-long stay at the hospital in Providence. McGee, his former Harvard teammate, founded the Bowl for Ben fundraiser, an annual event to kick off Harvard-Yale weekend that donates all of its proceeds to his recovery. This event also serves as a reunion for several former players from Murphy’s early years with the team, who aid in Abercrombie’s recovery despite never having shared the field with him.
“We went to the Bowl for Ben and there were some guys who played for Coach Murphy decades ago,” Marty said. “You can just tell that connection’s there.”
In 2019, after taking two years off to focus on his rehabilitation, Abercrombie returned to campus and re-enrolled in classes, where he found an academic home in Economics and lived in a suite in Weld Hall. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic presented another challenge, with his injury making him more vulnerable to the virus, but Abercrombie continued taking classes remotely before moving into his current home in Winthrop in fall 2021. His room reflects the people and the sport that has shaped him, with flags representing the Crimson and the Alabama Crimson Tide, his original hometown team, adorning the walls.
Abercrombie’s favorite class this semester was one on finance, which he cited as the best that he’s taken at Harvard. After graduation in May, he hopes to work in sports finance, representing professional athletes. Wherever his career takes him, though, he will likely continue to be a presence for the Harvard team.
In addition to attending every home game, Abercrombie watches the away games in his suite with friends and family, and he occasionally attends defensive backs meetings. His football insights have continued to be valuable to Murphy, as the head coach meets weekly with Abercrombie and his family, where they usually talk about college football, including the upcoming week’s opponent. Abercrombie has also promised to keep Murphy abreast of promising prospects who, like him, hail from the Yellowhammer State. Along the way, the two families have built a deep personal relationship.
“They always stop by once a week to chat, and for me, it’s by far the most enjoyable and inspirational part of my week,” the coach said. “We’ve grown very close to Ben and his family. … The remarkable closeness, resilience, and such big hearts, whether in these circumstances or not, they’re a very charismatic family in the best possible context.”
Even as he has reintegrated himself back into campus life, his emphasis on his physical recovery has not waned. Throughout the course of his rehabilitation, Abercrombie has focused on regaining the muscle mass that he lost in his first weeks in the hospital, and on keeping his muscles strong. Since 2018, he has attended therapy sessions at a facility in Canton, Massachusetts, called Journey Forward, a non-profit, activity-focused rehab center, which is “dedicated to bettering the lives of those with spinal cord injuries or disability.” Journey Forward tailors its programs to every individual patient, focusing on improving clients’ weaknesses.
“With spinal cord injuries and any neurological injury, everybody is a snowflake,” said John Walters, the vice president and program director at Journey Forward. “Everybody’s unique and different in how they present and in their recovery.”
For Abercrombie, the emphasis is balance, stamina, and breathing. At Journey Forward, which he visits every Friday, Abercrombie uses a variety of equipment to strengthen his muscles and stimulate the neural connections involved in walking and standing. The Lokomat, for example, is a machine that resembles a full-body harness and which moves Abercrombie’s legs in a walking motion. He continues his training at home each day, by using his specialized wheelchair to stand up and an exercise bike, by which electrodes can be connected to his arms and legs in order to stimulate the nerves and allow him to ride. One prominent goal is to get him off the ventilator and tracheostomy tube that he currently uses to breathe.
“We [do] a lot of trunk work,” Walters said of the weekly sessions. “We do a lot of standing activities and a lot of balancing things, through his shoulders, his neck, and his head.”
All of these exercises help prepare his body for any breakthrough in spinal cord injury treatment that could come with advancing medical research. Abercrombie’s father pointed to a clinical trial beginning this year for a compound intended to boost nerve regeneration after spinal cord injury as a potential difference-maker. The family also travels to Chicago every few months to take part in rehabilitation studies there.
Abercrombie talks about his recovery with a sly smile, which breaks out into a full grin when he talks about the Harvard team or the college football predictions that he makes each week. People who know him well rave about his optimism and energy throughout the last few years.
“I grew up watching Ben from afar, as he was a couple grades ahead of me at Hoover,” a fellow Hoover native, senior cornerback Alex Washington wrote via text. Abercrombie cited Washington, who is two years his junior, as one of his closest friends on the team.
“When you talk about character, you generally talk about very basic — good person, highly motivated, resiliency skills, adversity skills, leadership skills,” Murphy said. “Ben would be the absolute epitome of all that through the most challenging of circumstances. We’re always looking for the next Ben Abercrombie.”
Walters echoed this sentiment from his time working with Abercromie.
“You got to have a sense of drive and determination and character,” he said of Abercromie’s motivation to continue his studies, his rehab, and his involvement with the football team. “It’s definitely inspirational.”
Another person who entered Abercrombie’s life after his injury and has since been struck by his personality is John Schall, the owner of El Jefe’s and the organizer of the Ben Abercrombie Day fundraiser. Shortly after the injury, he emailed the Harvard Varsity Club and later introduced himself to the Abercrombie family. On Dec. 12, 2017, he hosted the first Abercrombie Day.
Schall has a deep understanding of what Abercrombie faces: 46 years ago, his younger brother, Mike, suffered a spinal cord injury from a car accident that left him paralyzed, at the same age of 18. Mike was also a state champion athlete in track, but his decades-long road to recovery has presented challenges that Schall and his family have faced together. Schall also gave back to another high school track star in 2011, when he hosted a fundraiser at his other restaurant, Fire + Ice, for Brenna Bean, a state champion pole vaulter who had been involved in a serious car accident the year before and was paralyzed from the waist down.
“Once Ben got hurt, I knew I was going to do something,” Schall said.
Five years later, Schall’s efforts have combined to raise over $127,000 for the fund, which helps finance Abercrombie’s recovery and has pledged to support any other future athletes who may suffer spinal cord injuries while playing for the Crimson. The day is an all-hands-on-deck effort, and that doesn’t only include every El Jefe’s worker, it also includes the football team, which stands outside the restaurant’s doors each year to bring attention to the cause. Schall is hopeful that, after the franchise moved to a new, larger location in August, the 2022 edition will be the biggest yet. His goal — $40,000.
“More people fit inside here as well,” Schall said. “We can do greater volume out of here than we could do out of that smaller store. … Partly, this is just about how many people we can get through and how quickly can they get through.”
On Tuesday, hundreds of Harvard students, dozens of Abercrombie’s current and former teammates, and Abercrombie himself will flood the store, generating thousands of dollars towards his recovery and further installing El Jefe’s as a prominent Harvard institution in the square.
As for what Abercrombie will be ordering?
“I like their nachos,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing at Lynah Rink is not for the faint-hearted. With the Cornell Big Red’s passionate fans, a cowbell in the student section, and the famous pregame fish toss, it has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the toughest places to play in college hockey. That makes a victory there all the more special.
“Coming out as a senior with a win was something that I know our senior group is really excited about,” said senior forward and captain Baker Shore. “Over the years, we've learned it's always gonna be a tough place to play, so getting that win on our last trip was something that's special to us.”
After a game that was tightly contested until the bitter end, the No. 7/9 men’s ice hockey team left Ithaca, N.Y. on Friday night with a thrilling 2-1 overtime victory. They were unable to carry the momentum forward on Saturday in Hamilton, N.Y., as Harvard fell to the Colgate Raiders 6-4 after a back-and-forth contest.
“I think tonight we learned that you have to be ready every night and you can't beat yourself,” said head coach Ted Donato after the loss to the Raiders. “I give Colgate a lot of credit, but I feel like some of what happened to us we did to ourselves.”
HARVARD 2, CORNELL 1 (OT)
The raucous crowd had a lot to cheer about early on, as the Lynah faithful continued their tradition of pelting the ice with fish before any game against the Crimson. The Big Red gave its fans a reason to celebrate just over two minutes into the game, as after Cornell won a puck battle along the boards, defenseman Travis Mitchell beat senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson with a wrist shot from the point that snuck through traffic. However, Big Red forward Winter Wallace ran Gibson over after the puck had crossed the goal line, giving Harvard a two-minute power play. The Crimson was unable to find the immediate equalizer, as the Big Red killed off the penalty, only allowing a single shot attempt. The rest of the first period was an even battle, as each side put together a few shifts of sustained offensive pressure. Harvard’s best chance came for junior forward Alex Laferriere towards the end of the frame, but Cornell goaltender Ian Shane snuffed out the threat, and the Big Red ended the first period leading 1-0, with Cornell recording a 9-7 advantage in shots on goal.
“It's definitely a challenge, but it's one I think our guys look forward to,” said Donato regarding the scene in Lynah. “I think our guys enjoy the privilege to have that kind of environment.”
In a back-and-forth second period, the Crimson and the Big Red traded chances at each end of the ice. Harvard’s top line of sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, junior forward Sean Farrell, and first-year forward Joe Miller posted a strong shift in the offensive zone four minutes into the period, creating a chaotic netfront scramble that forced Shane to cover the puck. Cornell responded shortly thereafter with a strong three minute stretch where they put six shots on Gibson, who similarly withstood a scrum in front of the net to locate the puck and prevent any damage. The Big Red continued to carry play for the majority of the rest of the period, but the Crimson’s top line found the equalizer with just over 90 seconds to play. Farrell made a great play at the left faceoff circle to elude his defender and attack the net, and while his initial attempt did not find twine, Miller was there on the doorstep to clean up the rebound and tie the game at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting conclusion in the third period.
“I think something we pride ourselves on as a team is winning in different types of situations,” Shore said. “So whether that's a fast paced game or a tight 1-0, 2-1, whatever it may be, I think we pride ourselves on winning in all types of situations.”
Harvard improved its play in the third period, limiting Cornell to a single shot on goal. With both teams eager to avoid making a fatal mistake against a bitter rival, the game evolved into a defensive slugfest, as the first shot on goal for either team did not come until over six minutes had passed. The Crimson began to pick up the pace halfway through the period, throwing more pucks on Shane and forcing the Big Red defense to lay out to block shots. With the tension and energy in the arena rising and the home crowd on their feet, Cornell had a late chance to win the game in regulation after a Harvard icing forced the Crimson to use a timeout to set their defensive strategy. However, no damage was done after sophomore forward Zakary Karpa won the ensuing faceoff, and after an anxious final few minutes, the archrivals headed to 3-on-3 overtime deadlocked at one goal apiece.
In the five-minute, sudden-death extra session, the packed house of 4,267 waited with bated breath as the two teams battled to find the winning goal. In the end, the game-winner came from a familiar combination. Just over a minute into overtime, Coronato and Farrell sprung out of the defensive zone for a breakaway against Shane, but the Big Red netminder made a fabulous save on Farrell to keep the game alive, sending the home crowd into a frenzy. However, Shane failed to locate the rebound, which had popped high into the air above the crease. When it landed, Farrell wasted no time hammering the game-winning goal into the half-open net, silencing the crowd and sending Harvard pouring off the ice to celebrate along the boards.
“We try to stay on our toes, not our heels,” Donato said. “As a team, we have good team speed, so we try to use that not only offensively but defensively…in the third period and overtime combined, we had one shot against so we did a good job, while still having opportunities.”
COLGATE 6, HARVARD 4
For the second consecutive night, the Crimson allowed a goal after less than three minutes of play. After Raiders defenseman Reid Irwin’s shot from the point was deflected by a player in front of the net, the puck pinballed around in the crease and off forward Matt Verboon before it slid past first-year goaltender Aku Koskenvuo, who was making his second start of the season. Harvard controlled play for the next few minutes, with Farrell hitting the post two minutes after Verboon’s tally, but they were unable to find the equalizer. Colgate had several strong shifts in the middle of the period, as well as a late power play after Coronato was penalized for slashing, but Koskenvuo withstood the pressure to keep Harvard’s deficit at one, although a cross-checking penalty on Coronato after the buzzer had sounded set Colgate up for a power play to start the second period.
“I don't really want to put any of the blame on external circumstances,” Shore said. “I think as a group we'll look at tonight and use the break to learn from some of our mistakes.”
The Raiders were unable to capitalize on their power play to open the second frame, and only four seconds after their man advantage expired, the Crimson tied the game. After Farrell forced a turnover in the offensive zone, Shore located the puck and fired a spinning pass back to Farrell, who fired a rocket one-timer past Colgate goaltender Carter Gylander, knotting the score at 1-1. Farrell gave Harvard a 2-1 lead just over 30 seconds later, as he maneuvered around the Raiders defender into prime scoring position before redirecting a point shot from sophomore defenseman Ian Moore past Gylander. The Crimson extended their lead to 3-1 halfway through the period, as a sustained offensive zone shift for the third line of first-year forwards Marek Hejduk and Philip Tresca and senior forward Austin Wong produced a goal for Hejduk, whose long-range wrist shot beat a screened Gylander.
Despite surrendering its early lead, Colgate did not go away quietly, battling back to tie the game by the end of the second period. After first-year defenseman Mason Langenbrunner was sent off for interference only 25 seconds after Hejduk’s goal, the Raiders’ power play cut into the deficit just over a minute later. Moore attempted to clear the puck up the boards to spring Farrell and Coronato for a shorthanded rush chance, but he misplayed the puck, and forward Alex Young, left all alone in the slot, received a quick pass and made no mistake on the shot, beating Koskenvuo and trimming the Harvard lead to 3-2. Colgate returned to the power play less than two minutes later after an interference penalty on sophomore defenseman Kyle Aucoin, and Young scored his second power play goal of the night when the Crimson lost track of him during a puck battle in the slot, granting Young a wide open net. Harvard had its own power play towards the end of the period, but despite registering five shot attempts in the two minutes of man-advantage time, the Raiders penalty kill held the score at 3-3 after two periods of play.
“I think we took some undisciplined penalties; we took penalties in the offensive zone, getting some penalties that were unnecessary in relation to the threat of the other team scoring,” Donato said. “When you do that you play with fire. We had some opportunities to play the puck and didn’t, and it came back to bite us.”
Colgate opened the third period much like the first, scoring in the first two minutes of play. Forward Ross Mitton won an offensive zone faceoff against Coronato, exploding past him to find the loose puck, and Mitton quickly fired a centering feed to forward Alex DiPaolo, who deflected the puck over Koskenvuo’s shoulder, giving the Raiders a 4-3 lead. The Crimson had a chance to answer on the power play halfway through the period, but Colgate capitalized on a shorthanded breakaway for Colton Young, who rammed through Koskenvuo in the process of tallying a critical insurance goal. The call on the ice was reviewed but the goal was upheld, padding the Raiders’ lead to 5-3. However, Harvard took advantage of their remaining power play time, as senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun poked home a loose puck after an intense netfront scramble. The Crimson turned up the pressure on Gylander late in the game, generating chance after chance with Koskenvuo on the bench for the extra attacker, but despite some close calls, Harvard failed to find the tying goal, and Alex Young secured a hat trick with an empty net goal as the buzzer sounded, handing the Crimson their second defeat of the season in a 6-4 final.
“They got a couple of bounces but you kind of make your bounces when you work hard and you do the right things and I thought for us, we cheated the game a little bit at times,” Donato said.
With the season at an unofficial halfway point for final exams, Harvard’s next game will come on Friday, December 30th on the road against the Boston University Terriers.

Are you deep in the trenches as finals loom closer and closer? Are you dreading the month’s worth of lectures that you have to watch in 24 hours? Same, bestie. What better way to feel better about yourself than to meander over to a different study spot and get a change of scenery? Your roommate will thank you for leaving the room for the first time in a week. Trust me. Without further ado, here is a round up and rating of classic study spots around campus.
Smith Campus Center, 10th Floor
This is arguably my favorite spot to study with my roommate this semester. When you come during the less busy hours, like weekday evenings, there’s so many couches to lounge on and, of course, lo-fi music to listen to. Most recently, they were playing a lo-fi mix of K-Pop songs — shoutout to the Smith playlist gods. When you’re looking to catch up on those months worth of Stat lectures (I’m not even kidding, please send help), this is a perfect place to do it.
Comfort: 4/5
Volume: 3/5
Workability: 4/5
Activity: Depends on the day and time
LISE, Buckminster’s Cafe
A hidden study spot that I discovered deep into my freshman year is Buckminster’s Cafe in the LISE building (behind the Science Center). Not only is there a Peet’s Coffee that accepts BoardPlus (unless you already spent all of it, like my roommate), but there’s plenty of seating. Don’t let the crowdedness of the first floor fool you — there’s more seating on the second floor, which overlooks the first floor cafe (perfect for people watching).
Comfort: 2/5
Volume: 4/5
Workability: 4/5
Activity: Busiest right after morning classes
Widener Phillips Reading Room
Overheard: “People who actually like working in Widener are friends with the voices in their head.” If you’re too intimidated to go into the main reading room because you have a perpetual fear of your hydroflask dropping and everyone death-glaring at you, consider going to the side reading room on the first floor. You can still enjoy the ~light academia vibes~ without the death glares.
Comfort: 2/5, but it’s aesthetic
Volume: 1/5
Workability: 4/5
Activity: 2/5, surprisingly
Lamont Second Floor Booths
Nothing will beat the night I bought a Celsius and a pack of Twin Snake gummies from CVS and marched over to Lamont at midnight to grind out my work. IDK what they put in the Lamont air, but I am a psetting-essay-writing-lecture-watching beast in Lamont second floor. Warning: beware of the awkward eye contact you make with the people walking to the bathrooms.
Comfort: 3/5
Volume: 1/5
Workability: 100000/5
Activity: 3.5/5
LamCaf
If you want to be ~perceived~ by other people as you work, this is the perfect place. The wide windows are perfect for you and passing tourists to have staring contests, and the layout of the tables ensures that people can sneak a look at your screen. Lamont Cafe, endearingly nicknamed “LamCaf,” is splendid for romanticizing your study session. IMO, the best place for a meet-cute or to have a study date <3.
Comfort: 3/5
Volume: 3/5
Workability: 3/5
Activity: 3/5
Boylston Ticknor Lounge
I remember having my little-mouse-moment here last year after grabbing sushi from the SEC. Featuring couches that sink way lower than you expect them to and people who weirdly stare at you when you enter, Ticknor is great for group gatherings or solo study sessions. Also great for taking meetings!
Comfort: ?/5, I cannot decide if the couches are actually comfortable when they’re trying to swallow me whole
Volume: 2.5/5
Workability: 4/5
Activity: 2/5
Honorable Mention: Blue Bottle
When you’re feeling like you need a bit more motivation to study, head over to Blue Bottle Coffee, conveniently located in the Square. Sip on your matcha latte (that you definitely spent too much money on) as you waste your time admiring how aesthetic you look to the passing people on the sidewalk. Will you get work done? I cannot guarantee that. I can guarantee that you will gaslight yourself into thinking that you accomplished more than you actually did, though.
Comfort: 3/5
Volume: Depends on time of day
Workability: 10/5, if you convince yourself
Activity: 3/5
Good luck on your finals, y’all got this. Touch some grass, breathe in the fresh air, and try out some new (or old and classic) study spots to complement mental pain as you try to teach yourself Markov Chains for the thousandth time in a row. Virtually sending everyone a million functioning brain cells <3.
