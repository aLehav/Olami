After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARIS, FRANCE — As I stroll down the grand boulevards of Paris, I look down occasionally, consulting my paper map: Boulevard Raspail, Boulevard de Montparnasse. These are the large roads which I can see on my paper map, but what I'm searching for is a small hot chocolate place I once read about in a book, marked on my map between the outlined roads. It's always the smallest streets where I feel the most welcome. These are the shops I see from the buses and tramways that I yearn to enter as they whiz past me, the shops where I can afford to eat, where I can continue my search for an artsy map of Paris like the vintage one of Boston at Black Ink in Harvard Square.
I was naive, which may be understandable considering it was my first trip to Europe and the first time traveling alone. I didn't know that my AT&T plan was so terrible that I had zero internet access in France. (Use T-Mobile or Sprint or the AT&T family plan for that, FYI.) Fine, I thought. My program does require us to buy SIM cards so let's chance the French companies. After 20 euros went down the drain as I tried to recharge my phone, I decided that I was going to manage without mobile data this summer.
Don't get me wrong: I have access at my host family's house and in the classroom. But as I roam around Paris, it is with a pre-planned itinerary, bus routes and metro stops saved as screenshots on my phone, with a large paper map in my pocket. I always feel so conscious about using a paper map; even the other tourists seemed to be judging me for it behind the screens of their phones, with navigation apps open. I once mentioned this to my roommate, and she just looked at me quizzically. "Do you think Parisians know their way around every single part of this huge city? They carry maps, too."
I have nothing against Google Maps; it's a great tool when you are crunched for time, or in the beginning when you really have no idea how to get home. However, I very much enjoy searching for the nearest train station, switching to a tramway for the above-ground view, hopping off when it's just too slow to take a random bus and then changing to the metro when I'm tired of the charade. Internet access on the go is a privilege, not a guarantee, and this summer has more reinforced that more than ever.
And besides, there's nothing like the feeling of being hopelessly lost and suddenly recognizing a familiar landmark or a shop which leads back to familiarity (or chancing upon the much awaited hot chocolate shop, L’heure Gourmande, only to find it packed with tourists).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a fancy-cheese-platter kind of dinner party with conversation as light and bubbly as the champagne. As we sat politely, the conversation slowly took a turn for the worse, from general groanings about President Donald Trump to local L.A. politics and finally to the homelessness crisis, all while retaining an airy detached tone.
It became too much for Lisa, the woman next to me. She interrupted, agitated, “But it doesn’t matter what we do! We talk and donate, but nothing will change unless big people start to care about little people. And they never will.” We awkwardly sipped our drinks.
Deep down, I felt comforted by Lisa’s outpouring. It meant I wasn’t alone feeling an inflated responsibility towards local, national, and international news and angered by privileged apathetic political conversation. So what was the remedy? After stammering a little, I countered: Even if the outcome is the same, the value of having conversation contributes positively. Just like voting is a contribution. She didn’t buy it. She locked eyes with me and said, “Those things are fine, but when you have world-wide systematic problems and corporations, you lose hope of positive change. How do you stay optimistic?” By the look in her eyes, it seemed more a question for herself than for me.
At the time I was taken aback, but I had felt her pessimism. I used to be intimidated by politics until my last summer in Shanghai. I tentatively started listening to daily news podcasts and learning about things like “subpoena” and “Robert Mueller.” It was easy going until news broke about the child separation policy at the border. I had a crisis. I wondered, did my tears have any meaning on the other side of the world? What was the point of conversations with fellow Americans abroad if the only remnant was a more acute feeling of helplessness? Even if I was in America, what would I do, share more Facebook articles and have more useless conversations?
Lisa’s outburst also reminded me of conversations I’ve had at Harvard. There is deep pessimism here as well, the build-up of resistance to living wages and proper healthcare for HUDS workers, resistance to creating an ethnic studies major, resistance to divesting funds from fossil fuel and prison industries, among other issues. Sometimes, these systems designed for humans don’t feel like they show any humanity. How do we stay optimistic?

I was thinking about none of this the day before the first Democratic presidential debates. The political media company I work for was preparing for a late night and I wanted to ground myself before the mayhem. So, when I saw an online coupon for floating in a sensory deprivation tank — a solution of 1,000 pounds of Epsom salt, devoid of sound or light — my inner Marianne Williamson jumped up.
Within a few seconds of floating, my mind drew a map of everything I was trying to escape because it wanted them in the tank. My thoughts relentlessly flung back to unresolved feelings: a heated conversation with a friend, imposter syndrome at work, growing numbness to news. I lost feeling of dimensionality and was suddenly washed with existential fear. I felt vulnerable in this dark tank like a baby in a womb. I wondered if this was what the afterlife was like. What does it matter if I got the 4.0 GPA or cried tears on the other side of the world or endeavored for greatness in this darkness? There was nothing.
My breath was my only sensory input, so I listened, rapt, and at that moment I resolved to love. If in death everyone was alone, I would fill my lifetime with cherished relationships, sacrifices for justice, and legacies for a kinder world. I imagined the water turning into a pool of golden compassion. When I left this chamber, I would embrace the world with open arms, come what may.
I began to feel dizzy, then distracted. I writhed as I looked up at the faint stars (were they on the ceiling or in the back of my mind?) and felt again loneliness. I mused, how do we carry on if no one could feel our individual pain, even with words or empathy? America had lost so much empathy, it seemed our ongoing crises of climate change, drug addiction and so forth were doomed to continue in ceaseless waves. In this distorted political climate, these disasters will haunt us by feeding on broken, underfunded infrastructure and lessons never learned. At that moment, I realized I could only depend on myself, not any bureaucracy or anyone else. Intuition and self-preservation were my highest truths. Self-love was my new philosophy.
I floated there, between thoughts of narcissism and altruism, solipsism and utilitarianism. It felt urgent to choose one way of living or another, but both sides felt heavy with truth.
How do we care about the big things while taking care of our individual selves? Loving people is hard; loving populations harder still. But because I can’t force others to act how I feel is sensible, I can only better myself to be an example. To fight the slogging bureaucracy of Harvard and the corrupt, racist Trump administration, I hold myself with integrity. I acknowledge my weaknesses and learn from criticism. In that way, maybe I can love others by loving myself. Earlier, Lisa essentially asked, should we engage or disengage? So maybe if I engage — with an awareness of my limited energy and resources — I realize devoting myself to societal causes and close friendships reflects what I love in myself. I volunteer to help Chinatown residents take their citizenship exam because I remember helping my mother with her exam over 10 years ago. Being a teacher is an act of love towards her. In this way, maybe I love myself by loving others.
I quietly climbed out of the tank feeling weak. I showered off the salt and put on my clothes. My mind was still floating in the tank, but still, I walked onto the busy street and called my mom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of Harvard’s graduate student union declared their intention to hold a strike authorization vote if Harvard does not change its approach to bargaining negotiations in an open letter addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow Monday.
Union organizers from Harvard Graduate Students Union–United Automobile Workers presented the letter — which has garnered more than 300 signatures — to the University’s representatives at the beginning of their Monday bargaining meeting. The letter referenced the signatories’ growing dissatisfaction with the state of contract negotiations, which began in October 2018 and have continued throughout the summer.
“If the Harvard administration’s bargaining team continues to put forward untenable positions for negotiation and prevents us from attaining a fair contract that responds to core issues of our campaign, HGSU-UAW intends to hold a strike authorization vote,” the letter reads.
The letter cites enduring stalemates over harassment and discrimination resolution procedures; wages; and medical benefits as issues that have yet to see agreements.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that HGSU members’ calls for an authorization vote are “unwarranted.”
“The bargaining process has allowed both the University and HGSU-UAW to gain clarity on each other’s positions. In response, both sides have worked together to offer meaningful advancements for student workers,” Swain wrote. “Although the University and HGSU-UAW still have areas of disagreement between them on issues important to both sides, the University disagrees with any characterization that these negotiations have not seen progress.”
Students, however, contended that the University’s proposals and responses were inadequate.
“If they don't want to bargain over those issues, then I think we need to take stronger action than we have up to this point,” Matthew R. Volpe — a Chemistry and Chemical Biology Ph.D. student who read the letter aloud at Monday’s meeting — said in an interview Wednesday.
Medical Sciences Ph.D. student Alexandra C. Stanton, who drafted the letter, said Wednesday that it is a “good next step.”
“As organizers, we collectively decided that this made sense as a good next step, to show our collective voice and show that we're serious about getting the things that we're asking for in bargaining,” Stanton said.
A vote on strike authorization is not the same as a vote on a strike itself. Rather, an affirmative vote for strike authorization would simply empower the bargaining committee to call for a strike when it deems necessary.
The HGSU-UAW bargaining committee distributed its letter in an email to its members Tuesday along with several updates from the Monday bargaining session. The union representatives said they discussed a number of issues during the meeting, including the ones mentioned in the letter that have not yet seen agreements.
The email specifically noted that negotiators spoke about gaps in coverage for specialists, mental health, and dental care on the student health plan. In particular, organizers argued that Harvard’s $50,000 total annual dental subsidy would only reduce individual students $558 cost by $12.50.
Swain wrote the University has offered proposals on wages and benefits that are consistent with those in contracts between other universities and their school workers.
“The University has also offered proposals on many new benefits for student workers that HGSU-UAW has identified as important to its members,” Swain said. “This includes the creation of funds totaling more than half a million dollars to assist bargaining unit members in covering the costs of dental and dependent health care, as well as child care.”
The union’s newsletter update also discussed deadlock on the HGSU’s proposed “neutral, third-party grievance procedure” in cases of sexual harassment. Committee members wrote that they would not give up their right to strike — as proposed by the University — without a “trade” for a “fair grievance process.”
This dispute has long been a point of contention between union and University negotiators. Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution currently adjudicates formal sexual harassment allegations.
“The University is concerned that HGSU-UAW’s proposed approach would create a separate set of processes for union members compared to all other students,” Swain wrote. “Additionally, the University would point out that an independent arbitrator would have no legal power to issue sanctions or any form of punishment on an offending faculty, student or employee.”
Swain wrote that the University “remains committed” to strengthening its resources for addressing and preventing instances of discrimination and harassment.
Despite the continued impasse on some issues, the union’s bargaining committee wrote in the newsletter that there was significant progress in Monday’s meeting in negotiating international student rights, intellectual property rights, personal days, and travel reimbursement.
