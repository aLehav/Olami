After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CW: The following piece contains references to sexual assault, child sex abuse, and victim-blaming. 
At the start of Netflix's "Athlete A," 16-year-old Maggie Nichols shows off her bedazzled white competition leotard with a giddy, unrestrained excitement. Before the 2-time NCAA champion gymnast met Larry Nassar, there was a lightness about her, the footage seems to say. She was a kid who liked sparkly things and dreamed of going to the Olympics. That should have been the end of the story.
There are many things that could be said about “Athlete A,” Netflix’s new documentary on convicted serial sexual abuser Larry Nassar. The film’s cast of survivors, including Nichols, each make a sacrifice that is difficult to fully describe, re-telling horrific abuse with an unflinching determination nothing short of inspiring. At the same time, the movie’s filmmaking techniques, including constant displays of young women’s bodies, frequent tearful confessions, and an underlying focus on the childish “innocence” of each victim, can feel misdirected and gratuitous, at times bordering on "trauma porn."
It would be remiss to unpack the implications of this kind of storytelling without first acknowledging the risk each survivor takes to tell their stories in the first place. Many of the survivors in the film have already faced countless hours of questions — from news reporters, police detectives, even friends and colleagues. Now, three years later, they have to answer those same questions again and bear the burden of proof in front of a larger, global audience. And with that re-interrogation, many survivors in the film attach their faces and stories to the crimes of Larry Nassar in a public, permanent way. Will the athletic or professional career of a decorated gymnast be overshadowed by a “victim” narrative? Will future partners see the movie’s Wikipedia page if they google you before a first date? Will a mother’s two-year-old daughter have to watch this someday? These incalculable sacrifices are not for nothing. A trial — even if some of its footage makes its way to Youtube — does not inscribe itself in cultural memory the way a mainstream documentary can. Its youthful subjects and story-centered narrative arc has the potential to help impressionable viewers begin to name a similarly traumatic experience or learn the long-term impact of sex abuse for the first time.
That being said, there are numerous problems with the way “Athlete A”’s creators choose to frame these brave advocates. Many directorial decisions — gratuitously displaying women’s bodies and athleticism to win sympathy from the audience, reminding viewers of just how much “potential” they had — send an implicit message that a victim’s positive characteristics are a valuable or necessary part of evaluating the criminality of sex abuse perpetrated against them.
They aren’t.
When advocacy work is centered around painting a survivor as a saint or a “perfect victim”— highlighting their total sexual naiveté, athletic prowess, or sweet "family values" — it sends the implicit message that their sexual abuse was only wrong, or only matters, because of how “good” they were. It implies that victims who aren’t prepubescent virgins, who can’t recount the exact details of their abuse because of dissociative amnesia or PTSD, who were too ashamed to tell their parents the first time, aren’t quite as innocent. It leaves us with an excuse each time a sexual abuse allegation is met with silence; the victim just wasn’t “innocent” enough.
So, is “Athlete A” a “good” documentary, per se, or even a necessary one? I’d argue the answer might be yes — but not without qualifications.
For better and for worse, “Athlete A” is not a story framed only in the past tense. All of its desperation to convince you to sympathize with Nassar’s victims extends beyond the final conviction of Nassar himself, but to the many, many people who protected him for so many years. That desperation can read as almost insulting — how could these talented, dedicated, and beloved kids be anything other than innocent? Yet former president of USA Gymnastics Steve Penny has faced no charges for his alleged years-long cover-up of Nassar’s abuse, and neither have dozens of other top officials who were allegedly informed of his behavior countless times.
All of this serves to answer the question — do filmmakers have to trot out the most heartstring-pulling footage of formerly-carefree kids who love sparkly leotards just to get people to care enough to do something? Do we have to force kids to relive their trauma, to prove their gymnastic potential and youthful naiveté over and over again in order to convince audiences to take sexual abuse seriously? Perhaps the answer is less of an indictment of “Athlete A” itself, and more of a reminder of just how broken our cultural understanding of abuse, justice, and “innocence” really is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — moved to maintain a typical endowment payout of around 5 percent for Fiscal Year 2021, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email last week.
The decision reverses administrators' previous announcement that the endowment payout would be reduced by 2 percent to compensate for financial losses brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
The decision was “based on the current performance of the capital markets” and an improved economic outlook for the University, Gay wrote.
“We are gaining a clearer understanding of the costs associated with the many elements of our fall plan, though we do not yet have final estimates,” she wrote. “We do know, however, that we will have more resources to put against those costs than we had initially anticipated.”
“This is good news, but we still will find ourselves operating in deficit and will need to continue carefully managing resources in the coming year,” Gay added.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed Gay’s message, but declined to comment further.
The Corporation previously voted to make 3 percent of all restricted funds in the endowment and make them available for immediate use as part of a “special assessment.” Around 80 percent of the endowment — which is made up of over 13,000 individual funds — is typically restricted to a specific program, activity, or school by its donor.
Newton confirmed that the special assessment will remain in place for the coming fiscal year.
Around 75 percent of Harvard undergraduates will learn remotely during the coming semester, per Gay’s email.
Thomas D. Parker ’64 — a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy — wrote in an email that the change could be due to increased need from Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools.
“In a universe that doesn't follow previous patterns, planning gets to be a bit difficult. It's no surprise then that financial policies would also be in flux,” Parker wrote. “I can only guess the Harvard specifics, but it's certainly possible that as income and spending projections came into sharper focus over the summer, it became apparent that the Schools needed more endowment draw to meet basic needs.”

The Harvard Management Company added three biopharmaceutical companies — including a firm developing a coronavirus vaccine candidate — to its investment portfolio in the second quarter as the overall value of their public securities holdings dropped 28 percent.
HMC's losses and acquisitions in the second quarter — which ran from April 1 through June 30 — were revealed as part of its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investment managers who oversee more than $100 million are required to disclose public securities holdings each quarter.
The decline in the value of HMC’s public securities follows a 32 percent drop in the first quarter of 2020.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and the Chief Investment Officer for Beacon Trust, wrote that the drop in value this quarter is not necessarily indicative of the endowment’s poor performance.
“What's most probable is that the management team decided to reallocate equities to other investment areas, such as alternative investments,” Longo wrote in an emailed statement.
“Most equity markets around the world rallied strongly in Q2, so it is highly unlikely a diversified portfolio of equities fell 28% in value without changes to the asset allocation,” he added.
All three of the new additions to the portfolio this quarter are biopharmaceutical companies: BioNTech, Generation Bio, and Pliant Therapeutics.
BioNTech is currently working with Pfizer to create a vaccine for COVID-19. The companies secured a $1.95 billion order for the vaccine from the U.S Departments of Health and Human Services and Defense in July.
Harvard bought around 30,000 shares of BioNTech stock, in addition to 500,000 shares each of Generation Bio and Pliant Therapeutics. Both companies had their initial public offerings in the second quarter.
HMC sold all of its shares in two other companies — the biopharmaceutical firm NuCana Plc and the software company Ping Identity Holding Corp., which it had just bought last quarter.
HMC also adjusted some of its investments in other prominent tech companies in the second quarter. It grew its shares in Uber Technologies Inc. for the third quarter in a row, this time from 2.8 million to 3.11 million. It also doubled its shares of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, from 28,000 to 63,000.
HMC significantly reduced its shares in Facebook, from almost 1.3 million to just 170,000, and Palo Alto Networks Inc., from nearly 1.18 million to 342,000.
The changes remain consistent with HMC’s previous investment patterns. All of the public companies HMC currently invests in are either technology companies or biopharmaceutical companies. HMC also invests in index funds, exchange traded funds, and gold.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard College students logged on to my.harvard earlier this week, some noticed a mysterious change: the disappearance of course ratings — known as Q Guide scores — from course listings.
Some undergraduates said they feel perplexed and frustrated about the missing scores as they sift through classes before the start of a virtual “early shopping week” on Monday. Several students added that the Q scores, which include average time commitments, qualitative comments, and instructor feedback, are their primary tools for selecting classes.
Harvard’s Office for Undergraduate Education completed its transition to a new vendor-managed version of the Q Guide in February, moving on from the “home-grown” system it developed for itself in 2004 and 2005. Though the new site still exists, its data is not displayed in the my.harvard course search tool as it was in previous semesters.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that, after hearing from faculty, Harvard decided to only display scores from within the past three years.
However, as of Friday night, students noticed that no courses — including those taught within the last three years — have Q scores attached to their listing on my.harvard.
Dane did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the universal absence of the scores in the my.harvard course catalog.
Sonya Kalara ’21 said they felt “enraged” that my.harvard’s course search results currently do not display any course ratings or a button that redirects students to the course’s individual Q Guide website as it has in the past.
“Everything else in the course search when you click on a specific course is the same. Everything else is in the same space, but there's no links to the course evaluation,” Kalara said. “For a while, I just thought I couldn't find it.”
“I don't take a course unless I've read almost all of the Q Guide responses — responses about what you would tell other students about this class, the time commitments, and how well people would rate the instructor,” they added.
Kalara also said that, while upperclassmen may understand how to navigate the various course catalog and evaluation websites, they worry the process is now more inaccessible for freshmen who are not yet familiar with the sites.
“It's only through being at the school for as long as we have that we know how to navigate these things, and we know where they're located,” Kalara said.
Still, some students have come up with creative solutions to the current absence of the scores.
Kendrick Foster ’22 said he also consults the qualitative feedback in Q Guide evaluations to assess whether or not courses would be a “good fit” for him. This semester, he is using a “workaround” to take advantage of previous course feedback when selecting classes.
“What I do now is go to the Syllabus Explorer page and find out whenever the last time the course was offered, and then I would have to go to the the Q Guide site itself and manually figure out the Q Guide results based on when was the last time the course is offered and then backtrack from there,” Foster said, referencing another Harvard website which posts course syllabi from previous semesters.
As my.harvard frustrates some students due to the missing Q scores, Joshua S. S. Archibald ’22, an inactive Crimson news editor, said he designed the course searching and scheduling platform Vericlass as a more student-friendly alternative.
“I've had plenty of painful experiences with my.harvard, as I'm sure many of us have,” he said.
His app “scrapes” course listings from my.harvard and their corresponding ratings from the Q Guide site, streamlining the circuitous process that Foster and Kalara described. His app also allows students to sort by both course ratings and average course hours — a function that my.harvard never featured.
So far, Archibald said, his app has seen more than 700 users.
“Insofar as [course evaluations] are actually visible on my app — whereas they're not readily accessible on my.harvard — I think that is definitely a selling point,” Archibald said. “We all like to see what other people thought of classes when we're trying to choose our own courses for the next term.”
