If you haven’t watched the seventh season premiere of “The Walking Dead” yet, read no further: Here be spoilers.
For the millions of viewers left in suspense by the shocking season six conclusion—charismatic yet supremely evil Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) savagely murdering one of the main characters—tonight’s episode provided a deeply upsetting answer. Negan’s brutality was worse than any fan theory suggested. Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) is the target of his season six attack, and his death is revealed after about 20 minutes—perhaps not the most expedient or respectful treatment, but effective nonetheless. The situation quickly becomes even worse when Daryl (Norman Reedus) attacks Negan in a fit of rage. After his men quickly subdue Daryl, Negan punishes the blow by murdering Glenn (Steven Yeun).
This is perhaps one of the most gruesome deaths ever aired on network television and certainly one of the most upsetting on the show. Negan smashes in Glenn’s skull, popping out one of his eyes and opening his forehead. The show’s incredible production team really struts their stuff here, as they have with great makeup and effects throughout the show. Aside from a fairly brief scene where Rick (Andrew Lincoln) has to fight through a swarm of zombies, however, the essence of the episode is the character contrast between Rick and Negan, the clash between the old world of the show’s first six seasons and the new world yet to come.
Morgan does a great job fleshing out the show’s newest “big bad.” He is the ultimate predator: controlled chaos and rage backed up by a deep well of sociopathic rage. He’s charming, but you never forget how deeply unstable that veneer of calm is. And he’s not just tough when he’s surrounded by his many, many goons.
This premiere, fundamentally, is about Negan breaking down Rick’s sense of agency. Over the last six seasons, Rick and his crew have steadily become more powerful. In season six’s Alexandria story arc, they were the best-adjusted, most competent members of the community. They seemed able to handle whatever the world threw at them.
Negan, leader of a mercenary empire, proves them wrong. He has more people than they do; he is a better hunter than they are; and all told, he’s a better killer than they are. Our heroes are not murderers—at least not in the way that Negan is. Even when killing a house full of people, they don’t revel in the violence the way he does. When Negan is literally smashing in heads, he’s playful. He’s cracking jokes, talking congenially with the survivors, a monster completely comfortable with misery.
Negan is unlike any other villains on the show for that reason: He doesn’t seem to be doing any of this for survival. He’s doing it because he wants to. Rick ultimately can’t handle someone with such power over him and such a ready trigger finger.
In the face of such uncertainty, there’s one thing that’s for sure: The show will be forever changed by this episode. Negan’s presence means more than the deaths of two main characters. It means a fundamental restructuring of the way the world of “The Walking Dead” works.
For the last six seasons, the story has mostly focused on short term goals, risks, and conflicts. The group deals with immediate problems of food, water, shelter, and safety. Season six represented a shift towards longer-term thinking, but even in Alexandria our heroes were still wrapped up in day-to-day activities. With the introduction of Negan’s empire, there’s a largeness to the world now that never before existed in the show. How far does Negan’s reach extend? What will Rick’s group have to do, and where will they have to go? How long will it take for them to exact revenge—or failing that, escape?
And this is where the most pressing question about the future of the show comes in. After the darkness of this episode, after Negan’s titanic shadow has been cast across the show, where do the showrunners go from here? Maybe Rick will somehow end up taking down Negan. More reasonably, they destabilize his empire. But how do the stakes get any higher? Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited to watch this season and expect it’ll be very different from what we as viewers have come to expect. But there’s a little voice inside me that’s almost sure this impactful premiere may mark the beginning of the end for one of the best shows on TV.

The last episode of the second season of British sci-fi anthology series “Black Mirror,” “The Waldo Moment,” centered on a TV comedian whose cartoon creation, Waldo, enters a local by-election as a joke. Waldo is extremely profane and frequently jokes about certain male genitalia but quickly gains traction due to his outsider status and authenticity; his unscripted rants seem like a welcome departure from the artifice of traditional politicians. The populace is largely entertained by his antics, and fervent groups of supporters develop and quickly become violent in his presence. Sound familiar?
This might seem like a mockery of the events of 2016, but look at the date it aired—Feb. 25, 2013. This episode isn’t merely parody; it’s prophecy. “The Waldo Moment” provides a perfect illustration of the prescient power of “Black Mirror.” The pessimistic vision of Charlie Brooker, the creator of the Channel 4 show and writer of nearly all of its episodes, has consistently infused the show with cutting social satire that is both audacious and eerily prescient.
Now, three years later, Brooker brings us six new hour-long tales. The third season, now on Netflix, has a somewhat different feel to it: The episodes are a bit longer and varied, and the show has largely set its sights on America rather than Britain. But the incisive satire about our relationship with technology and the media has thankfully stayed the same. Nearly every episode delivers a devastating gut punch reminiscent of the best “The Twilight Zone” episodes. The new season of “Black Mirror” fires on all cylinders.
For one thing, each episode is a masterclass in acting; the season’s relatively unknown starring actors and actresses (although some may recognize the main actress of “Nosedive,” Bryce Dallas Howard, from “Jurassic World”) navigate their respective episodes’ dark turns excellently, grounding the show’s abstract ideas and satirical points with genuine human emotion. Each leaves a crushing feeling of despair in his or her wake that underlines the urgency of Brooker’s satire, with one notable exception—the starring actresses of “San Junipero,” who introduce some much-needed optimism to the season. The effects are sleek and often dazzling, perhaps more so than the visuals of previous seasons, and the direction is extremely effective in ratcheting up the tension of each episode.
This tension is often the emotional crux of “Black Mirror” episodes, and with the new season Brooker has proved once again that he is a master of generating and tightening suspense. A constant presence of claustrophobic, maddening anxiety inhabits the darker episodes, keeping viewers glued to the screen in spite of the inevitable doom many of the characters face. “Nosedive” provides a perfect example of this, with the titular fall from grace of the main character grippingly paced across the episode, perfectly capturing the incessant, unrelenting pain of social humiliation. The new episodes’ near Shyamalan-level twists come as turns of the knife, raising the stakes of each episode to a fever pitch and finally driving home a devastating defeat of humanity’s goodness.
This isn’t to say the season is completely faultless. “Playtest” feels somewhat scattered, with a rushed conclusion, and a few episodes—“Men Against Fire” and “Hated in the Nation” in particular—indulge in some uncharacteristically clichéd science fiction tropes. Episodes tend to hit viewers over the head with their morals, which are sometimes rather obvious. But the genius in “Black Mirror” lies in not just what the episodes are saying about society but in how they are saying it. Brooker uses unusual but often brilliant narrative mechanisms to deliver his satirical messages, from swarms of mechanical bees to an online-rating-based social hierarchy to communities of genetically mutated outcasts. The various future worlds of the new season are laid out in meticulous detail, lending real depth and authenticity to each episode. The technologies that Brooker devises are made frighteningly realistic, and there is incredible invention in the uses and social effects of his projected technologies. It all adds up to a triumphant return for the sci-fi anthology show. The third season of “Black Mirror” is astute, unpredictable, and undeniably powerful—a satirical tour de force.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a music video opens with a dramatic, zoomed-in shot of Perrie Edwards mouthing “shout out to my ex,” one assumes the obvious: This is a shout out to her ex. And given that Edwards’s former flame is none other than former One Direction member Zayn Malik and that the fifth line in the song says something to the effect of “you suck in bed,” one continues to extrapolate: This is a snarky number designed to throw serious shade at Malik.
Except there’s more to it than that. Sure, Edwards and her girl crew (Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall, and Leigh-Anne Pinnock) repeatedly bash on Zayn’s underperformance as a boyfriend. After the “I hope she’s getting better sex / Hope she ain’t fakin’ it like I did” number, the Little Mix members continue to make snide jabs and declarations of independence. But these liberated lyrics and the emphatic thumping of the bass are mere distractions from what’s really important: the guide to Insta-fame.
Just think about it: The girls dance in front of their hipster trailer home with random Urban Outfitters-esque decor items placed throughout the background—a retro green lamp, a wooden cactus, a 1960s antenna TV. What at first glance seems a random scattering of objects is soon revealed to be a careful arrangement deliberately made to look effortless. Such is the secret to a successful Instagram flatlay, Edwards’s wink seems to say: exorbitantly-priced, kitschy household items and 30 minutes of rearranging for that perfect shot.
At the 30-second mark, Pinnock holds up a pistol; from her face hangs a Lady Liberty-esque frown and from the gun, a flag with the words “Over It.” This seemingly unnecessary diversion may perhaps be integral in expanding the horizons of what’s considered Instagrammable. Or could it be a poorly placed piece of social commentary, drawing the viewers’ grid-obsessed gaze away from their mobile screens and into the raw, real world of Sandy Hook and questionable interpretations of Second Amendment rights.
Nah. Less than a second later, the girls are back at it, throwing sarcastic words in Zayn Malik’s face while secretly pointing us in the direction of Instagram glory. They breeze by in a quaint antique Cadillac while purple trees dance in the background, reminding us that unconventional colors really stand out in an Instagram feed! Establish visual unity! One color only!
It’s true: The overall visual aesthetics of the four-minute-long video reinforce the didactic tone of this not-so-subtle tutorial on how to step up your Instagram game. The entirety of the video is filtered so that the girls’ skin looks effortlessly tanned. The backdrop, too, seems artfully faded: the blues of the sky, the dusky evening light…. Filters save Instagram feeds, y’all.
What, then, does the last shot do but reinforce this lesson? As the four girls wrap their arms around each other in pretend solidarity just as the sun falls down the mountain, the now-expert Instagrammer is reminded of two key takeaways: Firstly, the best candids involve fake laughs, and secondly, find good lighting.

The new CBS sitcom “Man with a Plan” features Matt LeBlanc as a recent stay-at-home dad, a premise that could have been somewhat engaging. Yet based on the staleness of the pilot, perhaps LeBlanc should have stayed home himself.
The former “Friends” star plays Adam Burns, a contractor from Pittsburgh whose wife, Andi (portrayed by Liza Snyder), goes back to work as a nurse after the youngest of their three children starts kindergarten. “I gave you three perfect babies, and as far as I can tell, you ruined them,” he soon laments to her after seeing new sides of their personalities. On drives to and from school the kids—messy, fatigued, and very hungry from a long day—begin to lose the initial excitement of spending time with their easygoing dad when he does not meet their demands. In response to this, Adam feeds one of his children the only snack he has in his car: a Listerine strip.
Adam’s incompetent plight is exacerbated when he learns that Andi had signed up to be “room mom” and that (as no other parents offer to take the role) he must fulfill these responsibilities. In this capacity, he meets a stay-at-home dad of four years, whom he initially views as pitiful but whose veteran experience he soon begins to emulate. Specifically, upon hearing that the other man rewards his children with scratch cards for good behavior, Adam discovers the glory of incentives. He successfully implements a Wifi password that changes daily so that his kids will perform their chores before relaxing after school; this action impresses his wife and is his only success since adopting his position.
The problem with “Plan” is not its simple concept but rather its failure to expand upon many aspects of it. The pilot starts with Adam and Andi preparing to announce their modified duties to their children, but it could have been more interesting to depict their conversations leading up to the decision. Furthermore, the episode never shows Adam in his career as a contractor (a job that he continues but restructures after becoming the primary caretaker of his children). The writers missed an opportunity to display the reactions of his coworkers to the adjustment. Would they mock him for taking on some of his wife’s responsibilities or hold their tongues? A show that has the potential to be a compelling exploration into gender roles has, so far, failed to be nuanced or insightful.
The series is plagued not by poor acting but rather by subpar writing. Both LeBlanc and Snyder are convincing in their roles as conventional parents, and most of the show’s minor roles are also competently acted. But regrettably, the show simply isn’t funny. The only memorable joke of the half-hour pilot comes when Adam tells Andi to “cut the cord and go to work” when she takes too long to kiss her youngest daughter before her first day of kindergarten. The rest of the humor relies largely on either cliché situational irony (“Guess who’s room mom now. Me!”) or ignorance (“Hormones? My mom had those”). Finally, the show has not yet developed the personalities of the three children—who seem to descend stairs and walk around school together, despite age disparities—enough for them to contribute to the comedy.
Only one chapter of the Burns’ story has been written, and perhaps “Man with a Plan” will improve with age. Adam believes that raising children is similar to building a house: Both require a “strong foundation.” Ultimately, such an infrastructure is precisely what this sitcom desperately needs, and it seems unlikely that one will be constructed in the coming weeks.

Poet Rupi Kaur performed spoken word poetry and read from “Milk and Honey,” her bestselling book, for a packed lecture hall in Sever on Oct. 28. Kaur became well-known in large part through her Instagram and Tumblr accounts, where she posts original poetry and art. The event drew a large local audience and attracted many students from area universities.
At the event, Kaur was introduced by members of Speak Out Loud, Harvard’s slam poetry group. She divided her performance into four segments, each a chapter from “Milk and Honey.”
Kaur’s fans admire the simplicity and honesty of her writing, said audience member Madison C. Schmitt ’19. “I like that she’s so raw in it,” she said. “It doesn’t take her a lot of words or any sophisticated words to say what she feels.”
Kaur herself also spoke about her interest in writing candidly. “My writing is a product of how I would interact with things that have happened to me or things that have not happened to me but have happened to somebody else,” Kaur said.
Audience member Anju Okutani, a sophomore at Boston University, expressed appreciation for Kaur’s acknowledgement of her generation’s concerns.  “I love Rupi’s work,” she said. “I think it’s really raw. I think it speaks to a lot of millennial anxieties and feelings. She writes about all these emotions in a really honest way.”
Because her publications are mostly presented through social media, Kaur’s poetry is accessible to a wide readership. She has sometimes been labeled an “InstaPoet”—one of a generation of writers who self-publish through social media. “I really don’t associate myself with [that label],” Kaur said. “That’s not the title I would go to add on my résumé. But… I think social media is… really cool in the sense that I don’t think that a writer like me would’ve found a readership if maybe Instagram wasn’t there. I tried to submit to publishers and anthologies and journals, but [they always said,] ‘We can’t publish this because there’s no market for it.’ But you post it on social media, and… it evens the playing field a little bit.”
The intersection of art and social media has improved users’ experience, according to Alin D. Clement, a junior from Northeastern University who attended the event. “That’s one of the coolest parts of Instagram,” she said. “There’s a lot of the more basic stuff, but that’s kind of where Instagram becomes more than just a social media platform. It’s a great way to share [not only] words, but also images and art.”
Grace Fernandez, a senior at Northeastern, agreed. “It’s really cool to have such immediate access to people who you think of as creative icons,” she said.
During one portion of the performance, Kaur asked for an audience participant to share the stage in a reading of her poem “to do list (after the breakup).” The participant was Moses Kim ’18, president of Speak Out Loud. “It just kind of happened. I really thought someone was going to raise their hand and I didn’t want to take their space, but then I thought, ‘I guess I’ll do it,’” Kim said. “I perform a lot as part of Speak Out Loud, but I’ve never felt as relaxed on that stage as I have with her. She opened the stage to make room for me. How playful she was in reading it made me feel confident.”
Kaur’s poetry focuses largely on themes of female empowerment, abuse, relationships, and cultural roots. “The topics just kind of come to me,” Kaur said. “If they are relevant, it’s because they’re happening in the world around me and it’s affecting me. Poetry is my way of dealing with it.”
Kaur, the daughter of Punjabi immigrants, concluded the performance with “Broken English,” a poem about her family’s adjustment to life in Canada. The poem resonated deeply with some audience members who identified with the immigrant narrative. “The poem about her parents being immigrants… that last poem really hits home for me,” Clement said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When an “Oriental” Las Vegas hotel operates under the Mikado’s tyrannical reign, how far will its staff go to save their love lives—and actual lives? Moreover, how far will the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players go to address race and gender in this highly controversial rendition of “The Mikado?” Despite the whirlwind of outcry and op-eds, the play still goes on, running from Oct. 28 to Nov. 5. And despite the talented cast’s efforts, “The Mikado” still fails to confront its historically racist past, bringing to this revision an unexpected bit of transphobia and an array of technical mishaps.
This version of “The Mikado” transforms the town of “Titipu” into an “Oriental” Las Vegas hotel in the 20th century. It’s a comedic love story at heart, following the tale of Nanki-Poo (Benjamin D. Grimm ’18) as he attempts to win back his true love—Yum-Yum (Isabella Kopits ’20), who is currently engaged to Ko-Ko, the hotel’s High Executioner (Aaron A. Slipper ’18). Things don’t seem to be looking good for Nanki-Poo’s love life, until Ko-Ko strikes a deal with him. Forced by the Mikado (Deng-Tung Wang ’17), Ko-Ko must execute someone by the end of the month. So he asks Nanki-Poo to sacrifice himself—in exchange for a month of married happiness with Yum-Yum. The agreement goes well until it is derailed by an array of absurd events, including a visit by an ex-lover and the Mikado himself.
In an op-ed in The Crimson, the Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ president, Kathleen C. Zhou ’17, wrote that the group’s reimagination of “The Mikado” wishes “to confront, not to ignore” the play’s controversial past. However, this version of “The Mikado” does neither. For example, the scene is set at an “Oriental” hotel in 1960s Las Vegas, complete with a stereotypical Japanese cherry blossom painting in the background. The characters are introduced as Americans with pseudo-Japanese names. In a self-referential twist, the characters seem to recognize that these elements exist—but not the fact that they are controversial. They simply let things be as they are. Rather than confronting the play’s historical racism, this revision ran away from it.
The one moment that comes close to confrontation is during the song “Mi-ya sa-ma,” when the hotel staff members are handed sheet music and are forced to perform the song for the Mikado. They clearly look confused, which is a step toward meaningful confrontation. But it’s still not enough. This scene tries to subvert the play’s previous racism but merely recognizes that the song is strange, never alluding to its racially controversial nature.
“The Mikado” appears also surprisingly, if unintentionally, offensive towards transgender identity. Katisha is portrayed by a man (Zachary Mallory) in heels, a wig, and fake breasts. Drag isn’t necessarily offensive towards transgender people, but in this case, the only instance in which a man plays a woman is when this man plays a particularly ugly and villainous woman.
In a forthcoming Frequently Asked Question document, Zhou wrote that the character "is not that of a trans woman, but rather a female character played in drag."
"While it was not our intention to present a negative portrayal of a trans character, we understand that the confluence of the character traits of Katisha and the male actor embodying her raises questions about trans representation," Zhou wrote, indiciating that the show had originally cast a female actress, but that actress had do drop the show last-minute.
Still, this metatheatrical drag distinction is unclear. When Katisha is first introduced in the song “With aspect stern and gloomy stride,” the hotel staff members cower in fear. They are clearly horrified by Katisha’s appearance. At the end of the song, when they finally push Katisha away, the rest of the ensemble gathers at the center of the stage in triumph, with Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum lit by the spotlight. It’s rather disturbing, and it reverses the progressive work the play has tried to accomplish.
Moreover, “The Mikado” fails in several technical aspects, most importantly in that it is very difficult to understand what the actors are saying. This isn’t necessarily an issue with the orchestra, as the two rarely compete for sound. The articulation of the words is just not clear during the songs. Additionally, the mirror behind the bar reflects a blinding light into the audience at times.
Another issue with “The Mikado” is the serious lack of worldbuilding. The action is set in 1960s Las Vegas—but why? The setting seems to have no purpose. Furthermore, the set seems confused about this particular aesthetic, combining elements that are either “retro” or “Oriental” but never both. The fact that the characters are recognized as American but have pseudo-Japanese is also strange. Perhaps the Mikado forced them into these roles in an attempt to keep his hotel’s theme? The answer is unclear, adding to the confusion.
Aside from these technical issues, “The Mikado” still has several redeeming qualities. Even though they can’t be understood, the actors clearly are all very strong singers, particularly Ida Paul ’20 and Wang. The acting is strong across the entire performance as well. It is clear that all actors fully understand their characters, especially Slipper, whose portrayal of Ko-Ko is near-perfect.He embodies a kind of hilarious poshness: “I have to get used to that first,” he says, cringing, after commanding Nanki-Poo to put his arm around Yum-Yum. He shudders, then asks Yum-Yum to rest her head on Nanki-Poo’s shoulder. After recoiling in disgust, he says with great reluctance, “Now kiss her.” The whole scene is entirely hilarious, mostly due to Slipper’s stellar performance. His character transforms from annoying to lovable under his direction. And the chemistry between Yum-Yum and Nanki-Poo is undeniable. When they try to flirt with each other in “Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted,” they do so with a sweet, innocent intimacy, rarely breaking eye contact. It’s moments like these that make “The Mikado” mostly entertaining despite its troubles.
“The Mikado” clearly has a talented cast—but, unfortunately, with its avoidance of confrontation, this retelling of “The Mikado” is not the subversive play its staff may want it to be yet. However, if the dedication from the Players and the revision of “Mi-ya sa-ma” is of any indication, a truly successful version of “The Mikado” may very well be on its way.

“Fertile Solitude” at the Boston Center for the Arts creates an immersive experience complete with art that appeals to every sense. The visitor's experience can encompass everything from smelling rain and cigarette ashes to touching withered 1950s magazines. These varied interpretations of solitude seek to redefine what it means to be alone. “It’s fine art in a very accessible way and a subject matter we all can relate to,” says Elizabeth Devlin, the exhibition’s curator.
The gallery features works by 15 artists, including Harvard’s own Annette R. Lemieux, senior lecturer in visual and environmental studies. Devlin says she selected some pieces, such as Cig Harvey’s “The  Screen Door,” for their individual merits, and others for the dynamics between them. Oftentimes, she let artists create pocket environments that visitors can move through within the gallery. Those environments include various depictions of solitude, such as a painting of a goldfish bowl, detailed photos of the moon and sun, and a 1950s boy’s bedroom.
Hao Ni’s exhibit, “Night Sculptures,” stands adjacent to the entrance and consists of art constructed from cigarette ashes, raindrops, fried rice, and more. “With everything we do and see and experience, there’s always something lurking behind, like this ghostly presence, so there’s a lot of reference to ghostly figures in the show because nighttime is dangerous,” Ni says. However, his work takes inspiration from everyday actions such as eating, smoking, driving, and drinking. “What’s haunting is mundane, everyday things,” Ni says. When asked about how his work relates to the theme of fertile solitude, Ni again references the monotony of modern life with which people have grown tired. “The loneliness comes in when you’re just thinking about and dealing with the things surrounding you,” he says.
Lemieux’s piece also interacts with humdrum actions. She found inspiration for her photograph in a Philip Guston painting called “Painting, Smoking, Eating.” She calls her own black-and-white photograph “Bad Habits.” Lemieux says that she wanted to recreate the painting not only because she relates to Guston as an artist but also because the painting captures an all-too-familiar feeling. “It’s that moment when someone is alone, thinking, or probably worrying,” she says.
Her piece shares a space with an eclectic group of multimedia works, including those of Erin M. Riley, which consists of several hand-woven tapestries depicting scenes from porn films. A public display of such a private, tabooed subject aims to reflect a kind of public loneliness that Devlin says she finds intriguing. Devlin herself mentioned experiences such as going to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, only to stand in a crowded room, unable to enjoy the art in solitude. She selected Noritaka Mimori’s photographs of a 1972 capsule hotel in Japan for a similar reason; the project, “1972,” also captures the clash of public and private. Devlin describes the hotel as a place of living in isolation together, similar to the way in which visitors take in the art at her exhibit. Devlin says the maze structure and intimate spaces of the show inevitably create individual experiences but also promote mingling as conversations arise regarding the pieces.
Moving out of Lemieux’s space, Devlin uses the sound of a fountain, sculpted by Piper Brett, to draw spectators toward the center of the gallery through a maze of other rooms. Devlin describes Brett’s piece as anticlimactic because people will expect some grand finale at the source of the sound, only to find a small, underwhelming recreation of the Belgian fountain “Mannekin Pis.” Rather than conclude the labyrinth, the fountain pushes spectators past it toward three more rooms. On the right sits the most interactive exhibit: a bedroom in which visitors are encouraged to open drawers, look under pillows, and browse photo albums. The claustrophobic space and dim lighting create a heightened sense of solitude as well as intimacy with the art and other visitors.
Fertile Solitude will be at the Boston Center for the Arts from Oct. 14 to Dec. 18.

Paulette Jiles’s latest piece cements her talent as a writer of historical fiction. “News of the World,” recently announced as a 2016 National Book Award finalist, is a delicately written lyrical ballad. This is no surprise, given Jiles’s prior work as a poet. Each word is chosen carefully, and despite the simplistic plot of the novel, Jiles manages to fashion a complex, sympathetic, and penetratingly honest account of her two main characters.
The plot of “News of the World” is by no means groundbreaking. The aged Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a traveling news reader in late 19th-century Texas, is tasked with bringing a white girl back to her extended family in San Antonio. The girl, Johanna, has been recaptured from the Kiowa Indians who kidnapped her and killed her parents years earlier. Now, with a language barrier and little trust between the odd pair, the Captain and Johanna must make their way through the nearly 500-mile journey to return her to her aunt and uncle. It is a story that has undoubtedly been told multiple times: Among others, Charles Portis’s “True Grit” shares a similar plot about an older man-younger girl friendship, and Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road” has the same long journey-based story. But it is Jiles’ writing that makes “News of the World” shine above the rest.
The novel takes place in 1870, following the passage of the 15th Amendment in a Confederate state soon after the Civil War. The Captain’s primary story is thus delivering the news of the passage of the amendment and the amendment’s unforeseen consequences: “Let us have no vaporings or girlish shrieks,” he says after conveying the news that African-Americans can now vote. Jiles manages the historical context of her story with finesse: The context of the post-Civil War era is present in the book, but the setting does not overcrowd Jiles’s characters or the incredibly strong narrative. Ultimately, the balance between history and fiction exemplifies the novel’s overall success.
As in Jiles’s previous work on orphan psychology in “Lighthouse Island,” “News of the World” contains an incredibly well-researched younger character. Jiles certainly uses a high level of detail in portraying the psychology of children “adopted” by Native Americans, and Johanna’s character directly speaks to Jiles’s studies. Johanna herself is an enigma, a paradox of emotion and determined resolve, a child and an adult, a Kiowa Indian and a white girl. Captain jokingly lists rules for her: “One, don’t scalp anybody. Two, do not eat with your hands.” His tone is light, but clear gravitas underlines his view of Johanna’s potential for “Indian savagery”. Yet Jiles’ novel also demonstrates Johanna’s growth from this previous characterization. She is initially described as “A redheaded stepchild destined for the washhouse,” a living stain on civilized white society. “News of the World” is a story of her integration first with Captain and her natural surroundings, then with the travelers that they pass on their way.
The book is ultimately a successful exploration of old age and resolving differences. Most noticeably, the cultural gap between Captain and Johanna narrows as the two adopt a shared language, customs, and familiarities with each other. An eventual grandfather-granddaughter relation forms along their journey, evident in the care and investment each of them have for the other. The novel speaks volumes about the passing of time: Both the narrative voice of the book and Captain himself grow wearier as his journey progresses, and by the time he reaches San Antonio, there are already signs of mass printing of newspapers indicating the end of his career.

The end of October brings bad weather, shorter and shorter days, and, of course, Halloween. For college students, Halloweekend usually means one thing only—get wasted—but some among us still appreciate the eeriness that comes with All Hallow’s Eve. If you are one of those souls, you can add Houghton to the list of places that will make your skin crawl. The library, as a collector of old books and manuscripts, has plenty of creepy stuff that is not the human skin-bound book bound lying around in the stacks, and any horror enthusiast will have a field day exploring the collection items below.
To start off on a more orthodox note, Houghton possesses a fair share of first editions of the Gothic novels that terrorized 19th century minds and made our high school nights a bit more sleepless (mostly because it took hours to read them). Among its holdings are the 1818 first edition of Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” (access to which is, unfortunately, restricted due to its fragility—the microforms can be found at Lamont under HOLLIS no. 006587145), the 1897 first edition of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” in its yellow cloth binding stamped in red (009433204), and plenty of original Edgar Allan Poe serials and books.
On the more modern side, Houghton also has plenty of materials connected to 20th-century American horror icon H. P. Lovecraft. Emilie Hardman, Houghton’s Research, Instruction, and Digital Initiatives Librarian, has written an article about the appearance of old books and manuscripts in Lovecraft’s stories. Ironically, the author’s use of these materials to set “the tone for terror in his work” often leads him to appropriate items that are not at all demonic, and his “book-based horrors are often fleeting, unsubstantiated in the light of day.” Hardman points to one of Lovecraft’s short novels, “The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,” as an example of how the author converts innocent books into harbingers of horror and evil; many of the works Lovecraft mentions in the novel can be found at Houghton. The library is also linked to Lovecraft in a much less obvious way: The board game “Call of Cthulhu,” based on Lovecraft’s œuvre, has a game card depicting Houghton Library, complete with a sinister drawing of the building.
Moving away from fiction and into reality, the library owns some oddly fascinating material concerning Aleister Crowley, a 20th-century British esoteric known for founding the religion of Thelema. A whole set of Crowley’s letters are at Houghton (013362685), and they are creepy, to say the least. Formulaic statements, unrecognizable symbols, and numerology abound, and Crowley signed his letters with the number 666 rather than his name. Crowley also contributed to a set of tarot cards, proofs of which are at Houghton; pentagrams and other eerie imagery are present throughout (013340169).
Finally, since Harvard is so close to Salem, Houghton has more than enough material on witches and witch hunts and trials, from the 19th-century manuscript for Elizabeth Gaskell’s “Lois the Witch”—the cover is laden with pentagrams (009585378)—to whole subject classes on witchcraft. An exploration of the old Widener classes on HOLLIS Classic (begin with 24245 on “other call number”) also yields spooky results from centuries ago, such as a report from 1647 about witches in the English county of Norfolk (005777103) and the description of a 1664 witch trial in Suffolk (007218007). If you have some free time between Halloween parties, do come in to rescue the true spirit of Oct. 31. Happy Halloween, and happy searching!

Source of Inspiration: I’m telling people about some really interesting things that are happening in the arts… and all these students that are doing amazing things. And that’s great, just seeing the wealth of imagination and creativity.
Meaningful Works of Art: I have two kids, and I take them to the Harvard Art Museums and we sketch because otherwise they’ll run around like crazy people. They don’t know that I can’t draw, and they don’t care…. I’m forced to do it because I can’t tell them no, because if I tell them no then they can be like, “Well, I don’t want to do this either, because I can’t draw either.” So I have to get over the fact that I don’t know how to draw and just do it.
I listen to The Band a lot…. Crazy hippies, right. Through them, I’ve learned so much about rock and roll and the history of rock and roll and… how [it] was formed in the South…. Bob Dylan just won the Nobel Prize, and I love that he doesn’t call them back; it’s hilarious, very Bob Dylan. So I’ve been listening to the stuff that he did with The Band because they were his backing band when he went electric. I’m really drawn to things that I can revisit at different parts in my life and see in completely different ways.
Favorite Book: “The Robber Bride” by Margaret Atwood…. It’s the story of four friends—well, three friends and, like, the most extreme frenemy ever…. Margaret Atwood really does female friendships very well.
When Not Working: I used to do a lot of little crafty things when I was younger, before I had children. And now they’re old enough… that I can do things again. I make little books, and I’ve been working on pop-up books because my kids are really impressed by them.
If You Could Have Lunch With Any Three People, Who Would They Be?: Definitely Margaret Atwood. Gogol, the Russian writer, because when I was a senior… we read all of these Gogol stories... and I was like, this is the best literature I’ve ever seen…. And how about Jackie Robinson? I just actually finished reading “In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson.” I read it to my kids last night. and he seems like a nice guy.
Best Piece of Advice You’ve Ever Gotten: In “Ghostbusters,” they say, “Don’t cross the streams,” and then later they say, “Cross the streams”…. Thinking about how you should follow the rule, but then at a certain point maybe you don’t have to—maybe doing exactly the opposite is what’s going to work.

You might have seen a few installments of Gregor, my interactive fiction game, on the Crimson over the past few weeks. Here are parts one and two. This week, instead of releasing the next installment, I want to provide a bit more background on interactive fiction and suggest a few of my favorite games. If you don’t really care about the details of the medium but still want to play, skip to my suggestions at the bottom. I won’t mind.
“Interactive Fiction” sounds like it’s for nerds. It is… but it’s also for everyone else. Interactive Fiction—also known as IF, text adventure, and choose-your-own adventure—describes any text-based narrative in which the player/reader uses text commands to navigate or control elements of the game. This may involve controlling characters to solve puzzles or simply choosing what happens next at certain points in the narrative. There are two main types of IF: text parsers and clickthrough adventures.
Text parsers are played by typing commands into a command prompt, as below.
-----
>listen          You search the silence for a hint of your prey, but there is nothing. Only the                     rustling of bats, off to the side.
Something shifts in the darkness ahead, a great silent bulk. Your prey.
>go north          Those directions have meaning under the stars and the sun. These caves...                   contain only themselves.          >look          Branching Cave          You glance around again. The cave narrows ahead, a tight crawl winding around           folds of limestone. A low passage descends to your right, and there is a side                 chamber on the left.
A faint rustling echoes deep in the side chamber, and the laughing chitter of                   bats.
>
-----
(From Hunter, in Darkness by Andrew Plotkin)
The commands in green are entered via the command prompt at the bottom (>). After each command, the game responds—sometimes with a clever error message, like the one that came up when I tried to “go north.” Even though the commands must be entered using certain syntax, these games can understand hundreds or even thousands of commands, even if they don’t all yield super relevant responses. Plotkin, one of the foremost IF writers, provides this guide for players learning to effectively use typed commands.
Since they have to handle far fewer inputs, these games can be created much more quickly than text parsers. They often rely more heavily on well-crafted prose than on complex interactive components, though this has been changing with new game writing platforms like Twine 2. Twine, a program that is extremely easy to learn and not too hard to master, effortlessly allows for game elements like health, variable conversations, randomness, and complex puzzles. Companies like Choice Of Games LLC have also been bringing dynamic choose-your-own adventures to the Apple and Android app store, creating a much wider audience for these games.
Much like a good book, a good IF game uses your imagination to build half the story. With a simple line like “You are likely to be eaten by a grue,” a game can suggest a creature and let your brain do the rest of the work. This creates highly personalized worlds in which everything is completely based on your own perception and imagination. As an active participant in the story, you really get to be the character instead of just reading about him or her in a linear fiction piece.
-----
Here are some of my favorite IF games:
Birdland—Brendan Patrick Hennessy—2015
A teenage girl is plagued by strange dreams during a summer at sleepaway camp.
Cat Petting Simulator—neongrey—2014
Pet that cat.
Zork—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—1980
This is one of the earliest and most iconic games of the genre. Written in the late ’70s, this classic adventure is full of trolls, treasure, and a weirdly normal house. You won’t win, but you’ll have a ton of fun trying.
Hunter, In Darkness—Andrew Plotkin (Zarf)—1999
A relatively short, non-traditional game. Claustrophobes be warned: You start off in a terrifying cave. First time players should type “about.”

Club Passim can be easy to miss. To get there, one must traverse the unsavory alley between the two buildings occupied by the Harvard Coop and descend a flight of stairs. The space at the bottom is unassuming in its tininess—the size of a large living room, with a glut of tables in its center and chairs pressed up against its perimeter. The stage sits at the back of the room, slightly elevated, able to accommodate three uncomfortable musicians at most. Club Passim’s modesty belies its unbelievable history: In the ’60s, when it was known as Club 47, it was the foremost spot to catch singer-songwriters in the Boston area. Joan Baez got her start there. A young Bob Dylan played between other people’s sets; billing was so competitive that even a future Nobel Laureate in Literature never managed to land a performance of his own. "Even then in 1962, 1963, [billing at Club 47] was the seal of approval that you had made it as a folk musician," said Millie Rahn, Club Passim’s archivist, in a retrospective for NPR. In other words, David Ramirez had enormous shoes to fill.
He filled them with aplomb. Stopping by Club Passim on his Bootleg Tour, in which each show is recorded live and distributed among the audience afterwards, Ramirez brought both professionalism and soul to his set. The Austin-based singer-songwriter is a seasoned performer, having released his first album, “11503 Lansbury,” in 2005 and toured steadily since then. Armed with just a guitar, a harmonica on a holder, and his voice, Ramirez never once slipped up onstage. He opened the set with a cover of a Neil Young deep cut, “Vampire Blues,” which lent him an opportunity to show off his range: His powerful voice, perfectly coated in reverb, alternated between upper-register howls and tuneful mumbles when he wasn’t ferociously attacking the harmonica.
“Vampire Blues” turned out to be a mere warm-up. Its subtle, purely decorative guitar strums and brooding mood instantly gave way to virtuosity and warmth once Ramirez shifted to his original compositions. Every chord change and turn of phrase in his songs united the room in exquisite sadness. Ramirez himself never fell short of captivating, bringing a presence and animal force to his set that exhausted him; he frequently wiped his face with a cloth, which sat on a nightstand beside Ramirez’s picture of “Groundhog Day”-era Bill Murray. On “Mighty Fine,” he slid in and out of a smooth falsetto, a rarity among his folk peers, before belting, “Boy, make up your mind,” holding the last word for a few seconds to create the maximum emotional impact. “The Bad Days” in particular, with its interpolation of Bonnie Raitt’s heartbreaking “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” provoked audible snuffles.
Ramirez proved to be charismatic in between songs as well. While at first, he merely delivered curt thanks in a stoic, Southern accent, he soon began to loosen up and banter with the audience. The moment he ended “Mighty Fine,” a glass shattered, to which Ramirez deadpanned, “Good timing. Too bad it was in the wrong fucking key.” A woman in the audience complimented his accent, and he feigned blushing. A man, who had been making incongruous headbanger gestures all night long, got up and exited in a flurry of obscene motions. “Did someone get kicked out?” Ramirez asked. “All I saw was what looked like the silhouette of Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters.” He then turned to the picture of Bill Murray. “That’s your friend, isn’t it?”
Compounded with his forceful songwriting and musicianship, Ramirez’s charm seemed to win over his audience, who continually expressed their fondness for him: One old lady felt compelled to exclaim, “All night long, baby!”, disturbingly. Her reaction was not incongruous. Ramirez succeeded in every aspect, crafting a truly absorbing experience. While it would be disingenuous to compare him to the likes of Baez or Dylan, he nonetheless proved his mettle and his immense talent, making himself right at home in Club Passim’s legacy.

Zoe: Have you ever looked in spaces, searching for faces that resemble your own, only to find none? It scares me that even while racial demographics have changed—making Latinos the largest minority in the United States—the spheres that should reflect that diversity within this country have remained the same: overwhelmingly white. Lack of representation, or representation without power, means never having the issues that matter most to our community resolved and never being recognized as more than just entertainment.
Ruben: And when the White People represent us, it’s for their own sake. They want our “exotic” identity to be one that is easily consumed. Don’t you see it in the sexualization of our brown, beautifully imperfect bodies? They want us to have the Latin lover’s smile or the JLo ass, and if we don’t, we don’t exist. Latinos lacking chiseled jaw lines or boner-inducing curves don’t grace our television screens. I stand shirtless in front of the mirror, and what is reflected there is not what I see on TV or on my movie screen. Instead of sculpted abs, I have a fairly normal stomach, but because there are nothing but sexualized, desirable individuals with my skin tone in our media, I begin to hate what I see. Unless they can call us Papi or Mami in bed to fulfill some wet dream, we’re not worth seeing.
Z: They do not deem us worthy of being in positions of true power. We can be seen for our beauty, our sexuality, but to open our mouths and demand for change is impossible. Every generation of Latinos has taken to the streets to fight for the issues that have always affected our community: immigration reform, better resources, struggling for a basic quality of life that should be guaranteed to everybody. But their cries echo in a chamber of whiteness founded on the broken promises that come from the lips of white politicians who can speak Spanish, but do no real work towards bettering our community. These politicians who thrive in their privileged institutions of power, meant to serve the people, but only if the people look like them. Where is the Latina senator that can demand for change for our communities?
R: It’s all about power. We can’t have it. They pretend that they’re okay with us having a voice, but all they’re doing is using us without having to grapple with the reality that we are more than the goods they seek to reap from our browness. They’ll try “ethnic” cuisine made by the colored folk to try feeling more cultured. They scream, “Oh my god, I love tacos—but I don’t love it when the men and women who make them move into my neighborhood.” A white, frat boy who went to an elite prep school suggests they have a South of the Border party. He thinks to himself, “We all love tequila, and there are no Mexican guys in our frat to be insulted, so it’s perfect.” They bastardize our cultures, drink their hearts out and claim it is appreciation, while brown children face deportation to war-strewn countries where they will die. White People love Hispanics, but only when it’s convenient and when they can use our culture as a commodity for their own purpose, whatever that may be.
Z: Some would say that we should be happy that we get a nod of acknowledgement at all,  that our culture has been deemed substantial enough for the majority to take note and “celebrate” it. But that celebration looks more like cultural appropriation to me, and when coupled with a complete lack of Latino voice on any major national stage, it spells continued oppression and marginalization of our community.
Maybe people wouldn’t so ignorantly wear my culture like a costume if they actually recognized us as a community worth listening to. Maybe if they saw Latinas in the Senate, in the corporate world as professionals, in the courtroom as lawyers and not criminals, then we would be more to them than just vessels of sex, food, and cute costumes. I am not your entertainment. I am not your costume. My community is one of beautiful diversity and tradition that isn’t meant to be adorned when you feel like being “exotic” for the night.
R: All I hear is, “Dance for me. Entertain me. Speak Spanish because it’s exotic and sexy, but don’t speak Spanish in the classroom because this is America and we speak English in this country. Let us decide how brown you’re allowed to be. You are too brown for Congress, academia, and the boardroom. You are too brown to be powerful, so entertain me. Dance for me, sing for me, because that is how I can consume you. That is how you are acceptable.” They are scared of our voices, yet they claim they want our melanin and culture to be in their lives.
But only if it is unthreatening. Only if it is theirs to own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was seven, my dad took me to a Cleveland Indians game, and I wanted a hat. He led me to the merchandise shop. We surveyed their shelves, stocked with blue hats, red foam fingers, gray t-shirts, and so on. Most featured a symbol I had seen throughout my hometown: Chief Wahoo, grinning obscenely, with terrifying eyes, an exaggerated nose, and a feather sticking out of his head. My dad asked the clerk if we could buy anything without Wahoo. I later learned that my dad had been involved in the rather unpopular effort to change the name of the team—or at least the logo—for decades. In keeping with his stance, we walked away with a very uncool hat commemorating the tenth anniversary of the stadium’s construction. I was unenthusiastic, but my dad wore it all the time, until it finally fell apart (or did chew-toy duty for our bulldog) years later. I now understand that my dad’s lame commemorative hat was almost defiant, the only way to show civic baseball pride without endorsing the ugliness of his favorite team.
Any sentimentality I have related to Chief Wahoo differs wildly from that of most Clevelanders, who grew up rooting for “the Tribe” without a lefty-activist dad. Like any sports logo, Wahoo serves to many as a visual synonym for the town. Clevelanders wear hats or shirts sporting Chief Wahoo intending to express solidarity with their team and city, a symbolism especially strong because the two share a certain long-suffering, working-class pluck. So, efforts to persuade Clevelanders of the insidious racism of Wahoo meet declarations of sentimentality and dubious claims that the name and logo “celebrate” Native Americans. Now, just as the Indians had begun to gradually retire “the chief”—the team changed its primary logo to a block C in 2013, keeping Wahoo on the sleeves but off the hats and score displays—the increased national scrutiny that came with their first World Series berth since 1997 has provoked a renewed defensiveness among the fans and, sadly, the team itself.
If viewed with fresh eyes, the problems with the mascot become obvious. But it’s hard to view something with fresh eyes when you’ve seen it daily for your whole life. And it’s even harder when the loudest critics are outsiders. Defenders are used to Wahoo-related controversy, but only from the city’s out-of-touch liberals and the occasional tiny cluster of Native Americans protesting outside the ironically named Progressive Field before games. Criticism from the East Coast media—the same people who only rarely remember that there’s anything between New York and Chicago, who predicted that first the Warriors, then the Red Sox, then the Blue Jays, and now the darling Cubs would steamroll the underdog Cleveland team (whether in basketball or baseball)—provoke even more hostility: Sigh, Cleveland against the world, as usual. Fans, whether or not they show up in actual redface complete with tasteless red-white-and-blue headdress, seem more determined to “keep the chief” than ever. And as a taunt to the haters, the team returned Wahoo to the caps.
But, strong as Clevelanders’ associations with Wahoo may be, I sincerely hope my neighbors can disentangle their civic identity, their justified resentment that the country belittles the town and forgets us until election year, and their pride in the marvelous journey of the baseball team from this image. It is not a celebration. It reduces an entire continent of cultures, identities, and histories into an insulting caricature.
Opponents of Chief Wahoo often ask his defenders whether they would defend analogous team names based on other ethnicities—especially in locations associated with the abuse or genocide of that group. (The last detail anticipates the “Fighting Irish” argument, which absurdly compares the Indians to the Irish-selected name and logo of the Irish-founded University of Notre Dame.) I’ve asked other Jews whether they’d want supporters of a team named the Munich Juden to stop toting a Jewish caricature or wearing yarmulkes or oversized noses to the game. Yes, it’s deliberately shocking, but the perspective shift is necessary to gain a clearer view of the impact of the Wahoo. If the noses strike you as insensitive, why does the blood-red Wahoo seem okay? If the nation that killed your ancestors and attempted to annihilate your heritage named a sports team after you and “celebrated” you by wearing crude imitations of your spiritual ornaments, would you really feel honored?
One potential reason Wahoo has endured so long, based on my own experience and conversations with fellow fans, is that the caricature is so extreme that our brains’ facial-recognition software doesn’t even see it as a human face. But, my fellow Clevelanders, force yourself to look into Wahoo’s creepy eyes. Try to find any humanity at all in his leering grin. Consider all those he putatively stands for, the millions of Native Americans whose identities we co-opt for a baseball team. After we beat the Cubs and bring a World Series championship back to Cleveland for the first time since Dewey beat Truman, let’s really think about Wahoo, and, while we’re at it, the name “Indians.” Sure would be nice to retire them on a high note.

This election, the people of Massachusetts will be voting on four ballot questions, the first of which, if approved, would expand a five-year old casino to allow a second slot parlor in the state. Currently, a 2011 casino law limits the number of casinos and slot parlors are to three and one, respectively—with two of the three casino licenses awarded. The ballot proposal would allow opening of one more slot parlor. The man behind this petition is Eugene McCain, a real estate developer who made his fortune in luxury hotels in Thailand. While the Mayor of Revere, Brian Arrigo, is campaigning against the ballot and the people in Revere have expressed disapproval of the plans in a non-binding referendum, the real estate developer seems intent on steamrolling his way through these local objections.
The narrow wording of the ballot question deeply concerning, and borders on the farcical. The proposed question would not open a statewide competition for licenses. Instead, it specifically would allow a slot parlor to be built on a property that it at least four acres in size, with a race track within 1500 feet of the property and not separated from the race track by a highway or a railway. This description points to some properties that Mr. McCain owns, or at least plans on owning, near Suffolk Downs in Revere. The specificity of this question leaves little doubt that it is intended primarily for one very specific private intent. It seems to be an instance of a wealthy individual trying to bend state laws and regulations for very particular benefits.
Another troubling aspect of this question is the opacity behind McCain and the proposal. Though McCain had previously filed for bankruptcy, he has refused to disclose his fellow investors or the source of seed money for the project. Arrigo has called the plan a "fly-by-night" operation, and it certainly seems like it.
Earlier research that helped draft the 2011 casino law showed that one slot parlor together with three casinos would maintain economic competition without over-saturating the market. Since all three casinos are not operational yet, the economic merits of the added slot parlor are difficult to assess. Furthermore, relatively high unemployment from the recession helped catalyze the 2011 effort.  Since the local economy has become better since then, the economic impetus that backed the 2011 legislation is no longer as pressing.
The proposed plan is not popular among local residents either. In a non-binding referendum in Revere, the residents voted to reject the opening of the gambling facility. While local residents can still stop the construction if Question 1 passes, the people of Massachusetts would do well to take account of the local opinion in their vote.
Moreover, gambling facilities like the proposed slot parlor have disproportionately detrimental effects on people from lower income class. Given the regressive nature of gambling, it is important that we prevent private motives like McCain’s from exploiting people who are struggling to make ends meet.
We, therefore, stand with the people of Revere in rejecting this ballot question. Not only is the opacity and the sloppiness of the proposal disturbing, but the plan doesn’t carry much economic merit either. The inclusion of this question in the ballot seems to be primarily an instance of a wealthy individual using the referendum process for essentially private motives. We oppose such a finagling of regulations, and urge a "No" vote on Question 1.

Michèle Lamont, professor of European studies, Sociology, and African and African American studies, explores the experiences of racism for five distinct ethnic groups spanning three cities on three continents in her latest book, “Getting Respect: Responding to Stigma and Discrimination in the United States, Brazil, and Israel.”
The book’s September release concluded roughly 10 years of research and more than 400 in-depth interviews with middle- and working-class citizens in New York City, Rio de Janeiro, and Tel Aviv. The book, which Lamont co-authored with six other academics, provides a multinational analysis of how politics and culture influence the racism members of these groups experience in their respective localities.
Lamont was inspired to write “Getting Respect” following her work on a previous book, “The Dignity of Working Men: Morality and the Boundaries of Race, Class, and Immigration,” for which she interviewed African American and white workers in New York as well as North African and white workers in Paris, France.
“One of the questions we explored in [“The Dignity of Working Men”] was what makes people equal?” Lamont said. “I became really interested in folks’ understanding of racial equality and inequality.”
Lamont added that “Getting Respect” explores different ethnic groups’ varying degrees of “boundedness,” or how strongly individuals identify with their racial identities.
Two of the groups Lamont analyzed in her recent book, African Americans in the United States and Arab Palestinians in Israel, were “very strongly-defined groups, in the sense that the ethnic identities of the groups are extremely salient to the groups.” The Ethiopian Jews Lamont studied were "bounded" to a lesser extent. In contrast, the Mizrahi Jews in Israel and black Brazilians were weakly "bounded."
Lamont hopes the book will inform readers with limited daily exposure to African Americans, and even highlight for African Americans aspects of their own experiences previously invisible to them.
“It’s a little bit like fish in water. If you spend your life in water, you don’t see the water,” Lamont said.
Lamont also hopes to contribute to the academic literature on racism in the United States.
“While most of the literature on racism in the U.S. is about discrimination—things that people can sue about—we find that when people talk about their experience, most of what they talk about is stigmatization,” Lamont said. “We’re advocating a readjustment of the literature on race that would be much more on the subject of people’s experiences.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sugar flowed this weekend as many Houses made candy displays and celebrated Halloween.
A number of Houses held social gatherings to celebrate the spooky holiday, while others undertook more extensive activities.
Kirkland converted its library into a haunted house. According to event organizer Daryn J. Forgeron ’18, this was the second year the House hosted this event. She said she wanted the event to be a chance for students “to get into Halloween spirit,” and that it was successful.
Luke Walczewski, a tutor in Kirkland who has staffed the party both years, said he was surprised the House had never held a haunted house event before last year.
“It was a lot of fun. We had a great time,” he said. “I couldn’t believe we hadn’t done it before.”
Despite a number of events occurring around campus on Saturday, the party had a high attendance rate.
“We had people lined up the door the whole time. People just kept coming throughout the whole night,” Forgeron said.
Kirkland resident Jiha Min ’18, who attended the party,  said she enjoyed the event and saw it as a way to encourage social gatherings in the House.
“I think it’s a really nice idea and a nice bonding experience,” she said.
Both Walczewski and Forgeron said they hope the event continues next year but recognized the planning process was time intensive.
“I would love to continue doing it,” Walczewski said. “It takes work to do it, and so you have to have somebody who's willing to take point and organize, but as long as there’s somebody who's willing to put in work, it’s great.”
Winthrop’s House Committee organized a catered soiree in the House dining hall Saturday night. Matthew T. DiSorbo ’17, a social chair on Winthrop’s House Committee, said the event hoped to provide a unique experience for attendees.
“We try to stay away from doing something at the same time or the same exact theme, because we obviously support what other Houses are doing and we want to have the most social thing possible,” he said.
He added that House-wide events of this sort require extensive planning.
“Dealing with sort of the building aspects—being able to move the dining hall, turn off the lights—that can actually be kind of a hassle,” he said.
Min said she appreciated the Houses’ efforts and hoped the events expand next year.

Freshmen may have a little more motivation than usual to clean their dorms this weekend as parents descend on Cambridge for Freshman Family Weekend from Nov. 4 to 5.
Students and businesses are preparing for the parents and family members who will be joining their children this weekend. The name of the event was changed this year from Parents Weekend to Family Weekend in an attempt to be more open to all families, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
“We are hoping that they have a wonderful reunion and that the families get a chance to learn more about Harvard and to meet their son or daughter's friends, faculty, and advisers,” Dingman said.
Many students expressed excitement for their family to visit them at school, and have been preparing for their parents’ arrival. Allison Piper ’20 said she will “definitely” be cleaning her room before the weekend.
Once students reunite with their families, they will have the opportunity to bring them to classes and hear special faculty presentations, including an address from University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Piper said she is excited about taking her parents to classes and club meetings.
“I’m going to try to take them to one of my classes on Friday and then to a meeting with the Women's Initiative in Leadership at the [Institute of Politics],” she said.
Other students are looking forward to the various special events held over the weekend. Michael Horton ’20 said he will attend the Catholic Student Association family mass on Sunday.
The weekend will also feature a football tailgate for freshmen and their families prior to this weekend’s match against Columbia. Dingman said that proctors will be by the football field so they can meet families of students, adding that “students whose families aren’t coming are invited to participate as well.”
Horace Payne ’20 said he was excited for the football game.
“We’re going to go to the football tailgate,” he said. “That should be a lot of fun.”
Local hotels and businesses are also preparing for the weekend. Several hotels, including the Hyatt Regency Cambridge, the Courtyard Boston Cambridge and the Boston Marriott Cambridge are offering special rates for the weekend, according to the Freshman Family Weekend website.
Harrison J. Choate ’17, managing director of apparel store the Harvard Shop, said the store will host an event with Harvard parents’ apparel “prominently on display.” Choate also said parents will be able to use their child’s 25 percent discount at the event, which will also include refreshments from David’s Tea and Pinkberry.
Horton said he was excited by the opportunity to see his parents.
“I’m excited for [the weekend],” he said. “It’s going to be good to see them.”

The Cambridge City Council passed three resolutions aimed at preserving the character of Harvard Square, including a proposed meeting with the University and other local stakeholders, at their weekly Monday night meeting.
Harvard Square has been at the center of city council discussion in recent weeks because of the proposed renovation to the historic Harvard Square "Out of Town News" kiosk and real estate firm Equity One’s planned reconstruction of three buildings at 5 through 11 JFK Street. 
The first resolution, sponsored by Councillor Jan Devereux and Mayor E. Denise Simmons, requests that Devereux, the chair of the Economic Development and University Relations Committee, host a “hearing” to discuss Harvard Square with organizations involved in local development such as Harvard, Equity One, and Colliers International. In an amendment to the resolution, the Council voted to add real estate mogul and Harvard donor Gerald L. Chan to the list of invitees. Chan owns a number of buildings in Harvard Square, including Hotel Veritas and the building formerly occupied by Uno Pizzeria and Grill.
According to the resolution, the prospective meeting will give the local stakeholders and residents an opportunity to “share their thoughts about the future of Harvard Square on the record, for business owners to share their concerns, and to provide the community with an opportunity to weigh in on this important discussion.”
Without naming a specific developer, Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen was critical of those who do not consult the city council before building or renovating.
“Developers need to know as a class broadly that we do have plans and hopes for this city and that if you try to jam something through that does not comport with those hopes, that it will not be an easy time and it will not be an inevitable win either,” Mazen said.
Two other resolutions each focused on the “Out of Town News” kiosk, one encouraging the Cambridge Historical Commission to perform a study granting the structure landmark status, while the other extended the period of time for a community taskforce to meet regarding the renovations.
Members of the council and Historical Commission Executive Director Charles M. Sullivan were previously skeptical of the impact that a landmark designation would have on preserving the kiosk. This spring, the City Council passed the city budget for the 2017 fiscal year, which included more than $4 million in allocated funds for kiosk and Harvard Square renovations. The kiosk has been on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places since 1978, and is within the jurisdiction of the Harvard Square Conservation District.
However, according to Devereux, assigning the kiosk landmark status is significant.
“Landmarking is symbolically and procedurally important,” Devereux said. “Once [the Historical Commission] actually does the study it will be obvious that it should be landmarked.”
Many local residents and Harvard Square business owners, including Suzanne P. Blier, professor of fine arts and of African and African American studies, spoke publicly to offer their support for the three resolutions. Blier, an active member of Our Harvard Square, an organization founded this year, has spoken often at city council meetings.
“I come here with a lot of thanks and praise for everything that people have done here,” Blier said. “I would simply urge you to think about this broadly.”
Along with concerns over the future of the kiosk and the Equity One proposal, Blier and Harvard Square residents have been troubled by a series of restaurant and retail closures in recent weeks. Just last week, longtime local favorite Café Algiers closed its doors after 45 years of operation.
“There’s obviously been a great deal of anxiety about what's happening in Harvard Square,” Devereux said. “Iconic stores and restaurants have been closing and there's a lot of rumors and a lot of concern.”
The Cambridge Historical Commission will meet Thursday Nov. 3 at Cambridge City Hall to continue discussion of the Harvard Square kiosk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s janitorial staff and security guards rallied Monday afternoon to draw attention to their contract negotiations with the University, marching a week after Harvard's dining services workers ended a historic strike.
The janitors and guards, represented by the local union 32BJ Service Employees International Union, are currently engaged in bargaining sessions with the University that kicked off in mid-October. Their contract is set to expire Nov. 15.
The rally, which began in front of the Smith Campus Center and advanced through Harvard Square and Harvard Yard, drew about 60 workers. With some wearing purple SEIU shirts and others opting for festive Halloween costumes, the workers organized in front of Mass. Hall, where Jason Faria—Higher Education Division Director for SEIU—spoke of the progress of the union’s negotiations.
Faria said the union had put all of their proposals on the table, though he did not delve into specifics.
“We are expecting a lot of responses from Harvard tomorrow, and we’ll have a clear sense from Harvard of where we’re going with this,” Faria said Monday.
Their march comes less than a week after Harvard’s dining hall workers’ historic strike came to a close after rocking campus for three weeks and resulting in the closure of nearly half of the undergraduate dining halls. Last week, the dining services union reached a tentative agreement with the University that established a $35,000 minimum guaranteed salary for full-time employees and covers, until 2021, health care copayments when they increase in 2019.
SEIU spokesperson Eugenio H. Villasante declined to comment on whether the union modeled their proposals on the HUDS agreement.
“Broadly speaking, the main bread and butter issues are fair wage increases to keep up with the rising cost of living, maintaining affordable family health care, and ensuring adequate funds for retirement,” Villasante wrote in an email.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement that “Harvard has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with SEIU. We continue to negotiate in good faith towards a mutually beneficial agreement.”
Absent from the rally was the same show of student support throughout the HUDS strike. When addressing the crowd, Faria asked for students to cheer if they were present and elicited only a few cries from the gathering. Soon after he finished speaking, that crowd disappeared.
Addressing those students, Faria said: “I know you’re tired. It was a long fight with the dining halls.”
The Student Labor Action Movement—the organization that spearheaded efforts amongst students to support the HUDS workers during their 22-day strike—was not present as an organization, according to SLAM member Gabe G. Hodgkin ’18.
Faria said the union intends to hold “small actions” throughout the campus for the duration of the week. Negotiation sessions are scheduled for Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, according to Faria.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday marks the first time that the full Faculty of Arts and Sciences will discuss a motion opposing the College’s controversial policy on unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Under the policy, undergraduates starting with the Class of 2021, who belong to those organizations— primarily final clubs, fraternities, and sororities—will be ineligible for leadership roles in recognized student groups and for Harvard’s endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The motion, which 12 professors submitted last May, states that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.” Its signatories argue the policy infringes upon students’ freedom of association.
The Faculty originally was slated to discuss the motion last month. But Harry R. Lewis ’68, a vocal opponent of the new penalties and a signatory of the motion, said some miscommunications between himself and members of the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body, spurred his decision to move the discussion to the November meeting.
The earliest date for a potential vote on the motion is December, in accordance with FAS meeting policies, Lewis wrote earlier in October. It is unclear, however, whether a Faculty vote in favor of the motion would override the College policy.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Faculty will vote on whether to delegate to the Faculty Council the power to recommend the rescission of degrees from the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Extension School, according to a copy of the meeting agenda obtained by The Crimson. If the Faculty approve the proposal, at least two-thirds of the Council present at a given Council meeting will need to vote in favor of revoking a degree for that degree to be rescinded.
Currently, rescission cases from the College, GSAS, and the Extension School must come before the full Faculty. In October 2009, the Faculty delegated to the Faculty Council the power to expel College or GSAS students.
According to agenda item on Tuesday’s meeting docket, “Though rescission cases are very rare, they, like cases of expulsion and dismission, can involve personal and complicated details that can be better handled by a smaller body, which can conduct a full and complete review of such serious cases.”
The Faculty Council would summarize any decisions it made about degree rescission to the full Faculty at the next meeting following such a decision. In addition, for any given case, Faculty Council members with conflicts of interest would not be present for discussion and voting on those cases.
The Faculty and the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, must approve the proposal for it to go into effect.
On Tuesday, members of FAS will also vote on updated procedures for Faculty Council elections, according to the meeting agenda.
The updates clarify some of the language used to describe the Faculty Council election process, including what kinds of Faculty members can hold one of the 18 Faculty Council seats. Nine Faculty members will be elected from three divisional areas—Arts and Humanities, Natural and Applied Sciences, and Social Sciences—and the remaining nine positions are “At-Large seats.”
While a previous iteration of the Council procedures stated that “any voting member” of FAS may run for an At-Large seat, the new wording states that “[a]ny ladder or senior non-ladder member (a professor of any rank, a senior lecturer, or a senior preceptor)” may stand for election to an “at-large seat.” In both versions of the elections policy, the “at-large” candidate cannot also run for a divisional seat, and the candidate’s given department must not already have two members on the Council.
The phrase “ladder or senior non-ladder member,” replaces the former phrase “voting member,” throughout the updated Faculty Council election procedure policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Constitution Center, a nonprofit that “seeks to illuminate constitutional ideals,” plans to host a debate at Harvard about the University’s new sanctions on final clubs and Greek organizations.
The event—which according to an email from NCC President Jeffrey M. Rosen ’86 would be co-sponsored by the Harvard Federalist Society and the American Constitution Society—would explore “the constitutional issues raised by sanctions on single-gender clubs and fraternities.”
Rosen, a George Washington University Law professor and contributing editor to The Atlantic, wrote that the three groups co-sponsoring the event have yet to nail down a date. Starting with the Class of 2021, the College’s new policy will bar members of final clubs and Greek organizations from leadership positions in recognized student groups and College endorsement for prized fellowships.
At least one Harvard affiliate has agreed, should scheduling permit, to argue against the sanctions at the debate. Computer science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, a vocal opponent of the sanctions and signatory to a faculty motion that he says would strike down the historic policy, wrote in an email that he was aware of the planned event and would be willing to present his case against the policy. College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that current Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who played a major role in crafting the policy, declined to participate because of scheduling conflicts.
While University President Drew G. Faust, and several other Harvard affiliates, publicly endorsed the policy after it was announced in May, many critics have continued to voice their opposition. Administrators involved in implementing the policy were met with a frosty reception at a preliminary town hall hosted in October.

Twenty Harvard undergraduates, including at least one athlete and members of final clubs and Greek organizations, will serve on a committee tasked with recommending how to implement a new College policy penalizing future members of single-gender social organizations.
The undergraduates are joined on the 37-member committee by professors from across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in addition to Harvard administrators. Last month, the two Faculty chairs of the committee—University Professor and Faculty Dean of Eliot House Douglas A. Melton and Music and African and African American Studies professor Kay K. Shelemay—reached out to students to solicit members. 
“There were many more applicants than we were able to accommodate,” Melton said.
“We hoped to get people who were athletes, people who were involved in single-gender social organizations, people who were not; we have people from the Undergraduate Council,” he said.
Last spring, Harvard administrators announced an unprecedented policy that will ban members of  unrecognized single-gender social groups from leadership roles in recognized student organizations and varsity captaincies. In addition, the policy will bar those undergraduates from College endorsement for top fellowships.
The policy is not without its critics; just days after the announcement of the sanctions, hundreds of women marched in protest through Harvard Yard, while several faculty—including former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68—have argued the sanctions infringe upon students’ freedom of association.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the convening of the committee in September and tasked them with recommending how to best implement the new policy when it goes into effect. The committee is expected to submit a recommendation to Khurana by the end of the spring semester.
Some students and faculty have questioned how the policy will be enforced. At a town hall College administrators hosted earlier in October, some attendees wondered whether the policy would require students to inform on their peers.
In addition to Melton and Shelemay, committee leaders include Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, and History of Science professor Janet Browne. Four undergraduates, including Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17, are also leaders of the committee. Rather’s campaign platform last year with Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17—who is also serving on the implementation committee—emphasized reforming campus social spaces.
Melton said that while reviewing applicants and appointing members, he and Shelemay hoped to find “people who have been involved with various organizations, people who have concerns with undergraduate student life, people with different experiences. The charge is to make sure that we get undergraduates from the broad spectrum.”
The steering committee oversees three sub-groups—“Governance/Implementation,” “Social Groups/Campus Community,” and “Communications/Benchmarking”—chaired by English professor Louis Menand, Pforzheimer House Faculty Dean Anne Harrington ’82, and Director of Undergraduate Studies for Women, Gender and Sexuality Caroline Light, respectively.
Several students on the committee chose to join because they wanted to help shape new social spaces on campus. Ethan B. Reichsman ’19, who transferred to Harvard from the small all-male, two-year college Deep Springs, said he envisions the committee working to “diminish the influence of the final clubs and fraternities and sororities not by penalizing the members but by finding a way to replace the important social role they play.”
Reischman also said he applied because he is interested in being involved in student governance on campus.
Ben I. Sorkin ’20, who is a member of the “Social Groups/Campus Community” subcommittee, said he applied for a position because he thought it was important to have “a freshman at the table” in the discussion of campus social life.
“Our short term goals are to provide a proposal to Dean Khurana on how to fill the gap left by single-gender social organizations that could be created by the policy,” he said.
Several other students on the committee declined to comment on their involvement and referred all questions to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.

Four pairs of students will run to become the next Undergraduate Council president and vice president, according to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
This year’s candidates for UC president, and their running mate for the vice presidency, are:
- Scott Ely ’18, with running mate Evan M. Bonsall ’19
- Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, with running mate Alex Popovski ’19
- Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, with running mate Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18
- Grant S. Solomon ’18, with running mate Alexander T. Moore ’18
Three of the presidential candidates—Ely, Gonzalez, and Sachee—are all juniors currently serving their third term on the UC and have served on the Council since their freshmen year. Ely is the UC’s current Education Committee Chair, Gonzalez is the former Freshman Class Committee Chair, and Sachee is the current Student Relations Committee Chair. 
Each of those three presidential candidates’ running mates—two of whom are sophomores—are currently serving their second term on the UC. Solomon and Moore have not previously served on the Council, though Moore ran for the UC last fall.
The four tickets received the necessary 150 signatures by Sunday night required to appear on the election ballot, according to Estes. The campaign period for candidates will begin next Tuesday, and voting will be open from Monday Nov. 14 to Thursday Nov. 17. Candidates are prohibited from appearing in the media prior to the campaign period.
In addition to voting for the next UC president and vice president, students may also vote on referendum questions. For referenda to appear on the ballot, either one-tenth of the undergraduate population must sign a petition in favor of the question appearing, or two-thirds of the UC must vote to put the question on the ballot.
The UC may vote to add additional questions to the ballot as late as next Sunday. The following questions have been submitted to the UC by students, and must receive 670 signatures in order to appear on the UC’s November ballot:
- Should Harvard College repeal the proposed sanctions on unrecognized single gendered organizations?
- Should the Harvard Turkey become the official mascot of Harvard University?
- Should exams be allowed on Housing Day?
- Should Harvard College raise the UC student term bill fee by $6?
- Should the single-gender organization sanctions also affect the casting division of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals until they formally allow women to perform?
According to the UC Constitution, any referendum question that appears on the ballot and receives a majority vote will compel the UC to act on the motion, as long as a majority of the student body votes in the election.
The new UC president and vice president will take office starting at the beginning of next semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While freshman Bente van Vlijmen took home Athlete of the Week honors after leading the field hockey team to an Ivy League-clinching victory over the weekend, three other Crimson student-athletes had especially notable performances, earning this week’s Athlete of the Week runners-up honors.
Courtney Smith (Women’s Cross Country)
This past Saturday, the women’s cross country team enjoyed a first place finish in the Heptagonal 2016 Championships thanks in part to junior Courtney Smith, who won the individual competition. Smith, completing the six-kilometer race in 20:19.6, found herself in a familiar position, as she has reliably finished first among her Crimson teammates since the start of last season. The West Chester, Pa. native improved upon her previous Heps times—20:55.9 in 2015 and 22:05.3 the season before that—to help clinch Harvard’s first individual title since 1989 and just the seventh Heps title in program history. Smith’s fleet-footedness set the tone for her entire squad, as four Harvard runners placed in the top 10 on the way to a decisive margin of victory over runner-up Yale and third-place Penn.
Sam Brown (Men’s Soccer)
The Harvard and Dartmouth men’s soccer teams entered Saturday tied for the Ancient Eight lead, with conference records of 3-0-1. Needless to say, their clash this past weekend was pivotal in determining the outcome of the Ivy League campaign. So, when Crimson junior Sam Brown buried his 80th minute goal—the only score of the contest—from the top of the box, he just might have altered the course of Harvard’s season. Brown was active all match, leading the Crimson with two shots on goal. With two conference games remaining in 2016, Harvard has the ability to dethrone the two-time reigning league champion Big Green and clinch the Ivy title for itself with a win against Columbia next weekend.
Corie Bain (Women’s Volleyball)
The Harvard women’s volleyball team battled through a five-set thriller against Princeton, which remained a flawless 10-0 in the Ivy League by ultimately winning the match. Crimson captain Corie Bain put forth a stat sheet-stuffing performance on Saturday, however, and was a major reason why her team was able to challenge the Tigers’ 13-game win streak. Bain recorded her fifth triple-double of the season, tallying 20 kills, 24 assists, and a dozen digs while also ripping two serving aces. The senior surpassed her average of just under three kills per set and commanded the offense with veteran poise. Bain, who notched her second highest kill total of her career this past weekend, was involved in all areas of the match—distributing, attacking, defending, serving—and proved why she is the Harvard record holder for career triple-doubles, double-doubles, and single-season aces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fog hung over the nearby White Mountains, and the temperature hovered just above 40 degrees as rain started to steadily cascade down onto Memorial Field in Hanover, N.H.
These conditions, paired with the memory of a gritty 14-13 showdown between Harvard and Dartmouth a year ago, pointed toward a similarly low-scoring game.
However, in a matchup that seemed destined to be defined by defense, both teams’ offensive attacks shone through as the deciding factors in the Crimson’s 23-21 triumph over the Big Green.
BALANCING ACT
The returns of junior running back Semar Smith, his sophomore backfield counterpart Charlie Booker, and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley gave Murphy a myriad of options offensively against Dartmouth.
Harvard recorded 206 yards through the air to go along with 199 yards on the ground. However, the offense was slightly more run-heavy than the yardage would make it seem. The Crimson ran the ball 48 times and threw the other 30 plays.
“Obviously, we balanced the offense today,” Murphy said. “Being able to run the football obviously takes the pressure off the passing game.”
The balanced offense seemed to work well, especially with a solid performance from the offensive line. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano was not sacked once, and he had ample time in the pocket to find his receivers or decide to keep the ball and pick up yards on the ground. Viviano was intercepted once, but this was Harvard’s only turnover.
A TALE OF TWO QUARTERBACKS
The Big Green has played like two completely different teams in conference and nonconference play this year.
It is an understatement to say that Dartmouth has struggled against its Ancient Eight counterparts, as it has yet to win an Ivy League game in four attempts.
In three nonconference contests, the Big Green is undefeated and has outscored its opponents, 77-48. These wins include a 35-10 rout of a Holy Cross team that beat Harvard and a 22-21 victory over No. 22 New Hampshire.
The team’s poor record in Ivy League games led Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens to make a switch at quarterback in hopes of sparking the offense against Harvard. Teevens went with sophomore Bruce Dixon IV over incumbent starter Jack Heneghan, a junior.
“I’m just a small part of Dartmouth football, so I need to listen to what our decisions are and do my best in whatever role that may be,” Heneghan said. “It was frustrating, but I looked at it as another chance for me to keep growing.”
However, Dixon IV struggled early, throwing an interception on his first pass attempt. He finished with only one completion in six tries.
Heneghan entered the game at the very end of the first quarter, and he never looked back. He finished the game with 301 yards and a touchdown on 32-for-48 passing. After the Crimson commanded a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Heneghan nearly guided the Big Green to a comeback victory.
“He didn’t miss a beat, and he and a lot of other guys gave them an opportunity to win the football game,” Murphy said. “They seemed at times to move the ball effortlessly with their controlled horizontal passing game.”
JUSTICE FOR FIRKSER
For the first five games of 2016, senior tight end Anthony Firkser was one of the few constants for the Harvard offense. Firkser averaged 99.8 receiving yards per game in the first half of the season, and he scored five touchdowns. In two games since, he has only caught four passes for 29 yards and one touchdown.
At the midpoint of the season, Murphy was possibly wary of Princeton and Dartmouth constructing defensive game plans to curtail Firkser, so he enlisted his other offensive weapons in these games.
Firkser’s lone catch in the Dartmouth game was a seven-yard gain to pick up a first down on the final drive of the game. For most of the day, the Manalapan, N.J. native was utilized for pass protection and as a decoy so the Big Green could not impose double coverage on Shelton-Mosley.
“We thought we’d get more opportunities to throw him the football, but we didn’t necessarily get the looks we thought we’d get,” Murphy said. “On the last play of the game, I said, ‘Anthony, that’s it for you at wide. You’re going back to H.’”
While Firkser has seen his targets decrease in recent weeks, Shelton-Mosley has trended in the opposite direction.
After sitting out of the Holy Cross loss, the second-year receiver has reintegrated himself into the offense the past two games with 159 yards on 12 receptions. Shelton-Mosley also scored his first touchdown of the season against Dartmouth. He tallied six his freshman year.
On the first play of the second half, Viviano connected with Shelton-Mosley on a short toss to the right side. The second-year wideout snagged the pass, cut hard to his left to evade a defender, and sprinted up the sideline before being pushed out of bounds.
This 39-yard gain was emblematic of how Shelton-Mosley can change this Harvard offense. Though Murphy has other options at wide receiver, such as senior Joey Foster and sophomore Brian Dunlap, Shelton-Mosley’s extraordinary athleticism allows him to extend plays after the catch further than the average Ivy League receiver.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The No. 16 Harvard field hockey team won its first Ivy League championship since 2004 by way of a hat trick from freshman midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. The Crimson (11-5, 6-0 Ivy) emerged victorious against Dartmouth (4-11, 0-6) thanks to the Netherlands native breaking the gridlock at the beginning of the second period with three goals within 12 minutes.
“She really brings a certain oomph to our team on the forward line,” junior midfielder Ellie Cookson said. “She’s been moved around a lot. I know last week she was playing center back, which is the complete opposite end of the field, so the fact that she can play center back and then go back to forward and score three goals is just awesome and a show of her dedication to the sport.”
Van Vlijmen has proved her versatility on the field by swapping between both defensive and offensive positions in a matter of days. She made her debut in the back line during the season’s most critical game against Princeton last week. She adapted seamlessly, allowing Harvard to remain undefeated against its hardest opponent.
“Due to injury with [sophomore back] Olivia Allin for the last week and a half we had to start to play Bente in the backfield,” said Harvard coach Tjerk van her Waarden. “I think she did that very well, she’s strong there and I think we’re comfortable playing her in that role. Bente in the forward position—that’s where we think she’s strongest and thankfully for us she was able to break through a little bit of a deadlock….her true talent showed and her fortuity and her quickness of her shooting really allowed us to set ourselves up to win the game.”
The stakes were high on Saturday—despite having beaten the Big Green the past two games, Harvard had the Ivy League Championship on the line that day. A surprise upset by Cornell against favorites Princeton meant the Crimson only had one obstacle in its way before achieving its fourth Ivy League Championship. The game started off slowly with both teams entering halftime without having scored. Despite the blank scoreboard, Harvard dominated the game from the beginning with 13 attempted shots versus Dartmouth’s three in the first half.
“In the beginning, we definitely had trouble playing the way we usually played but once that first goal came, we were all set,” senior back Sophie van Weede said. “[Bente] definitely came through for us, she just has such crazy power on the field and once the first goal came, they just kept rolling.”
Van Vlijmen hails from Zeist in the Netherlands and coach van her Waarden sees her international transition as a reason for her rapid development over the season.
“I know for any international student athlete coming to Harvard, everything is new and it can be overwhelming in a different culture and different environment far away from home,” van her Waarden said. “In my experience, most international students take a little time to grow into that and I think Bente has done that very well and as soon as she actually started to get really comfortable…you can see her influence on the field more and more.”
Coach van her Waarden even went so far to compare rookie van Vlijmen with senior forward Marissa Balleza, the program record holder for career goals and points scored.
“It was often Marissa Balleza or Bente…who were able to break down the gridlock we had when we were having difficulty scoring,” van her Waarden said. “It’s really exciting for us to see that a freshman can play such a huge role and step up and score goals when we need it the most. I’m excited to see what’s coming up for Bente in the upcoming years.”
Bente and the Crimson move on to play their final Ivy League game against Columbia this weekend. It will be Senior Night as well as the team’s final tune-up before going on to the NCAA Tournament.
