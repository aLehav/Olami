After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I think of Kevin James, I think of a strangely affecting image from early on in “Paul Blart: Mall Cop”: James, alone at a modest dining room table, breaking down over his shambles of a life, sputtering uncontrollably, his chin pressed to his chest. Yet no matter what search engine I type “paul blart crying” into, I can’t seem to find a clip of it anywhere. I’ll probably never know if this scene exists (life’s too short to revisit “Paul Blart”), so I’ll just say it’s my brain answering the question, “What does Kevin James do in his spare time?”
This profound sadness seems to inform James’ latest opus, “Kevin Can Wait.” The title plays on the phrase “heaven can wait,” an idiom which essentially means, “I think I’m gonna hold off on dying for now; I’ve got stuff to get done.” Unless James also wants us to postpone any dealings with him, it’s hard to tell what he can wait for and why he’s so proud of it. I imagine him mumbling to himself in the third person as he patiently awaits the sweet release of death. “It’s okay. Take your time. Kevin can wait. Kevin’s always been waiting.”
“Kevin Can Wait” is reportedly a sitcom, but James’ sunken eyes tell otherwise. He appears haggard, exhausted—a strange look for a multimillionaire most Americans find reasonably diverting. Yet James has made a career out of merely ridiculing his size in the decent CBS sitcom “King of Queens” and in consistently miserable Adam Sandler anti-comedies. It’s bound to be soul-sucking work. When I was a younger and especially undiscerning kid who somehow gravitated toward filth (“Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2?” Sign me up.), I used to find his turns as Doug Heffernan and Paul Blart endearing. James himself does not seem to share this sentiment. This apparent resignation colors his performance: He delivers his lines with an appropriate energy, but his expression remains hopelessly lost.
James plays a character named Kevin, which either means that he’s given up entirely or that he was just itching to get the pun “Kevin can wait” out to the masses. I hope for his sake that it was the latter. Kevin Gable is a cop desperately awaiting retirement, but he can only afford it once he manages to rent out a room in his house; only then may he dedicate time to his hastily sketched cop friends and non-cop children. However, trouble arises when his eldest daughter reveals she has dropped out of law school and taken up her old job at a diner to support her fiancé, Chale, who is developing a “visionary” app that no one bothers to outline in the slightest. While Kevin is at first outraged by Chale because of his name, English accent, and reluctance to ramble about football, he learns to accept the relationship, even offering the couple the spare room so that his daughter may return to her studies. In the process, he nobly sacrifices his retirement.
The drama works surprisingly well; it’s perhaps the most effective element of the show. Yet “Kevin Can Wait” is foremost a comedy, and in this regard it stumbles. The dialogue is lively but uninventive and not really that amusing, reminiscent of the dull, genial patter one can overhear at every family get-together ever. The characters are more peppy than clever, and all are poorly defined save for Kevin and his wife Donna, played by the admirably game Erinn Hayes. The overriding impression that the people onscreen give is that of their utter normality, and “Kevin Can Wait” begins to feel like a glimpse of the most deeply ordinary family imaginable. However, this impression is problematized by the extended bits, which grow bizarre no matter how familiar they are: Kevin dwells on the fact that he wants to eat four burgers, then on the fact that he has eaten the four burgers. There is protracted product placement for an unspillable bowl within the first few minutes of the episode. Perhaps the one good gag was the grisly murder scene cake at Kevin’s retirement party, complete with a decapitated figurine. I appreciated its incongruity (What’s a murder cake doing on CBS at 8:30 p.m.?), as well as its insight into James’s troubled state of mind.
Despite the near-absence of good material, the laugh track comes in far too frequently—to a shocking degree, in fact. “I’ve been battling a pretty good sized drinking problem,” confesses a potential tenant during his interview, as unseen beings tumble violently into hysterics. “Blackouts, mouthwash, the whole 9,” as the feverish laughter escalates. It almost feels like a punishment for the characters onscreen, haunted by disembodied cackling as they go through deeply mundane motions. Perhaps it’s the ghost of James’s conscience, shadowing him for the rest of his days, reminding him of what he has had to kill within himself in order to have this career. My question: Who are the humans on these laugh tracks? Are they in fact humans? And what’s making them laugh? Because whoever they are, they are certainly not watching “Kevin Can Wait.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt unexpectedly passed away on April 12th of 1945, his vice president, Harry S. Truman, found himself at the helm of a nation recovering from war and the most gripping economic depression in American history.
The day after he was sworn in as our nation’s 33rd president, Truman famously remarked to reporters on Capitol Hill: “Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellows ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me yesterday what had happened, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me."
Truman was at that point only 82 days into his vice presidency, and needless to say, he felt daunted by the task ahead of him. He wasn’t totally unprepared—Truman had a history of service in the Missouri National Guard and had fought in World War I. He presided as a local county judge and served a decade in the U.S. Senate. By many accounts, he had earned a reputation of honesty and integrity and was praised as being a “man of the people.”
As president, his experience and preparation were crucial. In the first four months of his presidency, Harry Truman negotiated the end of the war in Europe, led the Potsdam Conference to determine Germany’s future, and made the grueling decision to detonate two atomic bombs over Japan.
The deployment of the world’s first atomic bomb in Hiroshima and the subsequent bombing in Nagasaki killed more than 120,000 Japanese citizens instantly, and tens of thousands more were gravely injured from radiation. Truman made the decision, the most difficult of his life, to save hundreds of thousands of American lives and finally halt the Second World War.
After the war, in 1960, Japan and the United States signed a mutual cooperation treaty. The Japanese constitution, written during the U.S. occupation, precludes the country from maintaining a military, so U.S. bases are responsible for the country’s defense. Today, Japan pays over $4 billion towards America's military presence in the country, and the alliance is a linchpin for the U.S. defense strategy in East Asia.
At the Presidential Debate last Monday, the Republican nominee for president boldly declared, “They [the countries we defend] do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we’re losing a fortune,” and “that's why we’re losing, we’re losing, we lose on everything.”
Answering a question by the moderator about his stance on our country’s  policy on first use, Trump’s answer devolved into incoherent criticisms of China and the Iran Nuclear Deal. He denounced our decades-old alliances with countries like Japan and the Republic of Korea, a bulwark against growing Chinese influence, while also criticizing the president and the State Department for not doing enough to combat rising Chinese economic and military power.
Last Monday, Donald Trump failed to demonstrate even a modicum of understanding of foreign policy. And most frustratingly, he appeared to give no thought to the consequences of his statements.
It was abundantly clear that Donald Trump did not invest a single ounce of energy into preparing substantively for the first debate, nor has he invested any energy into preparing for the responsibilities of being president. Trump’s visionary foreign policy agenda is to build a wall and negotiate better deals—whatever that means—while backing down on support for our allies and receding further into American isolationism. His flippant threats about the use of force are unsettling, from his intention to “bomb the shit" out of ISIS to his threat to shoot Iranian ships out of the water. His comment about knowing “more about ISIS than the generals do” illustrates both an incredible lack of respect for the U.S. military and an unacceptable arrogance about the complexities of armed conflict.
And at one point in the debate Trump yelled about having a good temperament.
As a leader like Harry Truman showed us, no one is ever truly prepared to be president. But they can try. Behind every decision to act to save an American’s life, soldier or citizen, is a series of trade-offs and consequences we have to accept. Our commander in chief should approach the job with thoughtfulness and appreciation for the complexities that make governing and international diplomacy so challenging. He or she should understand that when it comes to nuclear warfare, our whole planet is at stake.
Our country’s next leader will face their share of trials; from coping with international terrorism and trying to heal painful racial divides to helping our nation compete in a global economy.
Donald Trump is not a “man of the people.” He is not prepared to be president, nor, in my opinion, does he have what it takes to be the leader our country deserves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Tuesday, Oct. 4, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is scheduled to debate the new restrictions on members of single-gender “unrecognized organizations,” including final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Since Dean Khurana announced the new policy last spring, it has drawn fire from critics who have argued that it is “over-reaching,” and imposes upon our students a "values test." As a result, a group of FAS faculty has proposed a motion that seeks to overturn the new regulations of these private, “unaffiliated” clubs. Professor Harry Lewis, a noted and outspoken critic of the new rules, reported three weeks ago that he had asked his CS 121 students to hum if they supported the rules; he then asked those who opposed the rules to hum. According to Professor Lewis, in this way he anonymously determined that the consensus was “overwhelmingly negative.”
Regardless of one’s point of view regarding the new restrictions on members of single-sex clubs, there is little debate that these “unrecognized” final clubs, sororities, and fraternities have a deleterious effect on College social life. Exclusionary by design, they undermine essential values that Harvard has sought to instantiate over at least the last half century. During this period, Harvard College evolved from a men’s school into a fully co-educational institution, committed to equality and merit in student admissions, faculty appointments, and staff hiring. These essential changes came slowly, but they are undoubtedly among the most important shifts in higher education writ-large, and Harvard specifically, over its history.
My colleagues who have sponsored the motion have expressed serious concerns that these policies, which would prohibit students who are members of the clubs from holding leadership positions and from securing the dean’s support for prestigious fellowships, would unduly compromise rights to “freedom of association;” and that the College has no business creating rules and attempting to influence these private, unrecognized clubs. This, it is worth noting, was an argument widely used by white-only and other discriminatory clubs and institutions during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and 70s.
What does it mean that the clubs are “unrecognized” or “unaffiliated?” If they were “affiliated” with the College, their admissions practices and discriminatory policies would clearly be prohibited. So the arguments against the new rules center on the clubs’ “independence” as private “unrecognized” organizations. But as those of us who study and work in the College know, the clubs are far from independent. The clubs are related to the College in many ways and they shape its culture. In this respect, they create harms for members of our community that invite scrutiny and regulation.
The new rules, rather than “imposing values” as opponents have claimed, seek to affirm core consensual values that motivate our work and unify our community. First, the social clubs undermine the essential tenets that have shaped our commitments to diversity, equality, and inclusion. These values are fundamental to our institutional identity and to how we seek to build a community in the College. Second, as the FAS and University reports on sexual assault and harassment over the last year have documented, the clubs have contributed to an environment that puts our students at risk of serious harm and, in some instances, criminal behavior. A wide range of interventions will be required to address comprehensively the problems of sexual harassment and violence, but we can no longer permit the “unaffiliated” or “unrecognized” status of these clubs to constrict the ability of the College to assert modest restrictions on their members. These single-gender clubs are “of” if not “in” Harvard College. Too much is at stake for the University and the values that we prize.
Two decades ago the College changed its rules about blocking and House affiliation, recognizing that there were fundamental issues about diversity in residential college life that could be addressed at least partially through “randomizing” the process of house assignment. Not surprisingly, there was considerable opposition to the policy. Critics voiced concern that the character of House life would be disrupted and the cultural traditions of the Houses eroded. Those of us who observed the introduction of this policy knew that it would take time to adjust, but hoped in the long run that this important change would serve the wider interests of our community. Professor Lewis, then Dean of the College, endorsed the goal of reaching gender-equality in the houses, irrespective of randomization. He noted at the time, “there was educational merit for all students in living in the same community with other talented students with different backgrounds and interests.”
It seems ironic that the opponents of the new rules express such serious apprehension that the policy will lead to the potential for discriminatory policies along a “slippery slope” with a “frightening prospect,” when the clubs insist on maintaining clearly discriminatory policies that promote material harms. These fears of hypothetical future abuses of administrative authority promote a status quo of exclusion and privilege that reflects Harvard’s past, not its future. If we had relied on such anxieties during the decades of advocacy for civil rights and gender equality, we would not have made the progress we have in the promotion of tolerance, diversity, and egalitarianism that increasingly characterize Harvard today and make it a better place to study, to work, and to live.

Harvard has announced the creation of a University Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, in part as a response to the College's diversity report of last year. This committee, comprised of 46 members drawn from across the University, will aspire to of “strengthen our shared commitment to building a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.”
Issues of diversity have long been prevalent on campus, and the University deserves credit for its continuing efforts to tackle these complex problems across all of Harvard's schools, many of which have seen burgeoning student movements dedicated to greater inclusion. Formalizing a task force that is wholly committed to the goal of making Harvard a more inclusive and diverse place shows true concern for the well-being of all Harvard students. While it is all too easy for undergraduates to view the formation of the task force as yet another overly bureaucratic response—the College already has the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, and released its own diversity report last year—this newly created task force spans the entire University, and it will only improve our understanding of multifaceted problems that require careful scrutiny. What’s more, the task force's deliberations will improve the odds that needed institutional changes  are carefully positioned for success.
That said, the imperative for collective, University-wide change should not stop the College from making administrative changes based on last year’s report. A plethora of actionable problems concerning the undergraduate population can likely be resolved on a faster timetable than the one on which the new task force will operate.
Indeed, affinity groups on campus have long been advocating specific changes that do not require a two-year process to implement. For instance, a more widespread program to diversity art around campus can proceed without waiting for a new report. In a similar vein, Harvard must make a concerted effort to hire more faculty of color. The undergraduate curriculum should continue to expand beyond traditionally Eurocentric disciplines, as exemplified by the steady growth of Asian-American Studies, and academic departments should make concerted efforts to diversify syllabi and reading lists. These changes are necessary to ensure that life in the College more accurately reflects the diversity of its student population.
Additionally, the new, University-wide task force should also be sure to address itself fully to issues of physical ability and health status that are too often overlooked in discussions of diversity. As renovations continue across Harvard's campuses, ensuring that physical spaces are planned with care will continue to be in imperative. And for people with chronic illnesses, clearer University-wide policies will prove invaluable.
Ultimately, the formation of this task force bodes well for diversity at Harvard, and downstream efforts to organize and research its recommendations should not be rushed. But as we wait for the task force's efforts to translate into larger movements to create institutionalized change across all the University, it is important to remember that there are smaller steps that the College and other schools can take along the way.

Deal-savvy college students acquainted themselves with the Museum of Science in Boston by exploring the intersection of art, music, and science during its annual College Night on Friday.
College Night, which drew hundreds of students from across the city, offered free admission to anyone with a college ID.
James R. Preiss, the museum’s marketing coordinator, said, “It’s a really good chance for us to give back… to college kids who wouldn’t necessarily be able to come on another night, especially since it’s September and everyone’s almost settled in at this point in the Boston area.”
Many college students and organizations planned outings to College Night for this very reason. Hundreds of students could be seen wandering the museum during the event.
Jeremy A. Goodsnyder, a student at Brandeis University, and Ben Palmer ’20, who were close friends in high school, decided to use College Night as an opportunity to meet up again after beginning college.
“It was something fun to do and I got to see [Ben],” Goodsnyder said.
Elaine Zhang and Marlin Elizalde, undergraduates at Babson, attended College Night as part of a “scholarship event” hosted by their sorority.
“It’s nice to relax and de-stress from school, especially on a Friday night,” Elizalde said.
Many student attendees cited the free tickets as a major draw. But while admission was free with a college ID, attendees still had to pay for some of the museum's shows.
One popular show was "SubSpace: Prince," the Museum’s newest addition to its SubSpace Project, which consists of a series of artist tributes in the museum’s planetarium.
Students who visited the show were immersed in images of spinning galaxies and molecule structures pulsating to the beat of Prince’s “Purple Rain” soundtrack.
SubSpace: Prince was just one example of the museum’s work this year to combine art and science, according to Preiss. The museum used the event to highlight its new lobby and the Yawkey Gallery.
“We’re really excited to show people the new face of the museum, how everything is constantly changing and on the cutting edge,” Preiss said.
Although College Night is over, the museum plans to continue hosting events geared toward adult museum-goers. The SubSpace series will continue with Tom Waits and Lady Gaga.
Many students said they enjoyed spending their Friday evening at College Night.
“This only happens once,” Jack H. O’Shea, a student at Tufts, said. “When you were little you couldn’t understand all of the science behind [the exhibits]. Now it’s cooler to understand what’s going on.”

Chicago Chief Innovation Officer Brenna Berman highlighted examples of data-driven analytics leading to policy reform and social change at the "Engineering and Entrepreneurship: The Internet of Things" symposium.
Two hundred and fifty attendees registered for the symposium, according to Gabriella Fee, a coordinator for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences' Center for Research on Computation and Society. Attendees at the event, which took place in Harvard’s Northwest Building on Friday, ranged from Harvard graduate students and faculty to members of the technology industry.
The Internet of Things refers to the phenomenon in which data is exchanged through ordinary objects.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria introduced Berman, who also serves as commissioner of Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology, lauding the power of digital infrastructure and innovation in business models and technology.
“In [Boston’s] history, as a city, we have been pioneers in many, many things, including the formation of this country. [Internet of Things] is an opportunity to be pioneers again,” Nohria said.
Berman, the symposium’s keynote speaker, outlined her vision for transforming what she calls the “future city.” She said efforts to improve cities require an “effective integration of human, physical, and digital systems in a built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous, and inclusive future for residents.”
“What [cities] do and how they behave matters, and they’re growing,” Berman said. Major social, economic, and environmental issues “are going to be solved or not solved in cities, and technology is going to play a major role in that,” she added.
According to Berman, the lack of information on the underground structures of cities poses a serious safety hazard. Using data-driven technology and stereoscopy, a type of scanning technology, Berman’s team has begun rolling sensors that will eventually create a city-wide map of underground infrastructure for construction companies and city officials.
Berman also emphasized the importance of increasing the functionality of data for citizens. She also explored privacy challenges associated with collecting data for public use.
The Internet of Things symposium was sponsored by SEAS’ Center for Research on Computation and Society and the Institute for Applied Computational Science. Both groups co-sponsored the event with the Business School and HUBweek, a week-long innovation showcase in Boston.

Amid a splash of colors and aromas, the new DAVIDsTEA shop that opened Friday in Harvard Square brings exciting products and flavors to its JFK Street location.
The store’s opening drew a large crowd with special promotions and giveaways. The branch is the company's first in the Cambridge area and its 11th in Massachusetts.
Over 150 tins of loose-leaf teas line the shelves behind the store’s counter, organized in color-coded “tea families” from white to herbal. These teas range from the more traditional, such as a pure-leaf “Spearmint,” to the whimsical, like the fruity “Midsummer Night’s Dream” with gooseberries.
According to DAVIDsTEA event marketing specialist Cindy Carlson, fan favorites include herbal blends such as “Forever Nuts,” comprised of almonds, apple chips, and beetroot; “Read My Lips,” a Chinese black tea with chocolate and candied red lips; and “Cold 911,” an organic blend with juniper berries, apple, and orange.
“I like that you can smell all the teas,” Maxine A. Patwardhan ’18 said, referring to the DAVIDsTEA “sniffers,” which allow customers to sniff each blend before purchase.
In addition to its loose-leaf teas, David’s Tea also sells tea accessories and kits. DAVIDsTEA offers a student care package for $10, which includes student-favorite blends such as the high-caffeine “Super Charge.” Other products include bagged tea, gift sets, travel mugs, and the company’s unique “ice tea shaker,” a specially designed bottle for iced tea on the go.
John Langois, a tourist who visited the shop, praised his experience at the store and called the staff “very helpful and friendly.”
“There are lots of different flavors, aromas, and things to brew the tea in,” he said.
According to a company press release, the chain opened its first location in Toronto in 2008. In the eight years since, the company has expanded to over 150 locations throughout Canada and, more recently, forayed into the United States.
DAVIDsTEA has a social impact initiative that provides direct assistance to nonprofit organizations, according to its website. The shop features an herbal blend, “Me to We,” whose proceeds go to the charity Free the Children, which provides clean water to children in Kenya.
The company also emphasizes local community outreach, according to Carlson. DAVIDsTEA recently ran a booth at the Igniting Innovation Summit on Social Entrepreneurship that took place at Harvard’s Northwest Labs Saturday. The store will also run a booth at the Head of the Charles Regatta, she added.

University President Drew G. Faust argued at a conference last week that universities have a responsibility to begin a public dialogue about the legacy of slavery on their campuses and in the United States.
In a discussion moderated by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a writer for the Atlantic who argues descendants of slaves should be paid reparations, Faust joined John J. DeGioia, the president of Georgetown University, in a discussion at the Washington Ideas Week about histories of slavery and racism on college campuses.
“We are exploring that and trying to understand what was the place of slavery in building the institution that we have today; what were the contributions made by slaves, enslaved people, to Harvard’s past, and trying to dig that out,” Faust said during the event.
In the last few years, both Harvard and Georgetown have started to publicly engage with their respective histories of slavery. At Harvard, Faust dedicated a plaque to four enslaved people who lived and worked on Harvard’s campus in the 18th century, and the Law School retired its seal because of its connections to slavery. This summer, Georgetown announced it would offer preferential status in its admissions processes to descendants of the 272 slaves owned by the university.
In an interview with The Crimson last Tuesday, Faust said a similar program would likely be untenable at Harvard, since the University did not directly own any slaves and kept incomplete records of those who did work there.
“I am not aware of any slaves that were owned by Harvard itself, and slavery was much less of a presence and an economic force in New England than it was in Washington, D.C., and the South,” Faust said. “Mostly slave records were kept as economic records, business records, and the records we have of slaves at Harvard are much scarcer and less complete.”
At the Washington event, Faust also discussed what she sees as the importance of values-based education at colleges and universities, a major theme from her commencement speech this year.
“We don’t just want to train them like automatons; we want to educate them in the larger context in which whatever field they’re pursuing will be practiced,” Faust said. “I think we have a huge responsibility to attend to these many, many issues in the field of race relations, in the aftermath of slavery, but in a number of other dimensions of injustice and social crisis as well.”
Harvard plans to further its conversation about the history of slavery at colleges and universities in the United States at a conference, which Coates will headline, in the spring. Faust has also appointed a committee of historians to further study slavery on Harvard’s campus and propose other potential memorials.
The sobering discussion was not without moments of levity.
“[Faust] is one of our finest living historians also, to my mind,” Coates said to applause. “It’s been a little hard to not fanboy out up here, but I’m not going to do it, guys, I promise. I’ll save it for backstage.”
“Well, that makes my year. My life,” Faust responded.

Braving dreary weather, dozens of students gathered Saturday beneath a tent in the Science Center Plaza to dance, raise money, and socialize at Zumbathon, a charity event for the local student-run youth homeless shelter Y2Y.
The two-hour event, sponsored by Harvard Common Spaces, is part of Y2Y’s ongoing outreach strategy to spread awareness of youth homelessness. The event raised money through the sale of $10 tickets. All proceeds from the event went to the homeless shelter, according to Samuel G. Greenberg ’14, co-director of Y2Y.
Participants engaged in Zumba, a group activity that fuses dance with fitness. Led by an instructor, participants swayed, jumped, and twirled to music blasting from speakers.
Kelsey Vercammen, a student at the School of Public Health, said she was attracted to the event because of its cause.
“It’s nice to get out here and exercise with a bunch of people,” she added.
Jacqueline D. Modesett ’17, Y2Y’s fundraising director, and Greenberg said they hoped the event would not only raise money for Y2Y, but also help spread awareness for youth homelessness more generally.
“Our objective in going into this program isn’t targeted around a specific number, but instead on community exposure and community involvement,” Modesett said.
Y2Y opened last December and serves young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. The shelter employs a “youth to youth” model to foster a safe environment for the residents, according to its website.
Greenberg said he hoped the event would create buzz about the shelter, which will reopen its doors in less than two weeks after a closed season.
“Hopefully, this Zumbathon event will set an exciting tone as we’re just two weeks away from opening for our second season,” he said.
This year, after doubling its season length from three months to six months, Y2Y leadership is hoping to expand on its work after spending the summer reflecting upon its first year operating.
“We’re perpetually reimagining ourselves,” Greenberg said. “In all ways, we benefit and depend upon the community.”
As the second season opening date quickly approaches, Greenberg noted that events like Zumbathon are important ways to attract volunteers for the shelter and spread Y2Y’s message to Harvard and beyond.

Harvard is stockpiling frozen foods in its dining halls ahead of a potential strike by Harvard’s dining services workers, according to workers stationed across cafeterias in the College.
Nine different employees said that they have seen unusually large quantities of frozen food being brought into the dining halls after their union announced in early September its preparedness to strike. HUDS workers have been bargaining with Harvard since May in an effort to hammer out the details of their new contract with the University. 
“Harvard does order some frozen foods on occasion, but nothing like this,” Laquiesha N. Rainey, a HUDS workers and union organizer wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Things like stuffed peppers, mac and cheese, and soups are taking up so much space in the freezers that a lot of halls don’t have the space to hold the current menu items we need.”
Annabel A. Pappas, another HUDS worker stationed in Pforzheimer and Cabot Houses, added that she was concerned that, should the union strike, students will have to eat “unhealthy” frozen entrees instead of food made fresh by dining hall staff.
Though it is unclear exactly how much food Harvard may have in reserves, Robert A. James—a general cook in Quincy House—said that, by his estimates, three days worth of frozen food has been stockpiled in the freezers in his House’s kitchen.
When asked directly about the stockpiling, Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin declined to comment beyond saying that Harvard administrators “remain focused on negotiations, but have a contingency plan in place” in the event of a strike.
The College's Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair echoed that sentiment in an email she sent to undergraduates this weekend, writing that “in the event that information needs to be shared regarding changes to your dining service, the College will immediately communicate those details with you through email.”
Harvard’s dining service workers announced on Friday that they intend to strike this Wednesday if a contract settlement is not reached by midnight on Tuesday, marking the culmination of a month of tense negotiations with the University. At their 17th negotiation session on Friday, the two parties continued debating the workers’ health benefits package and wages.
According to a press release from Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck, HUDS employees will begin picketing at breakfast on Wednesday if they decide to strike.
Should HUDS workers form picket lines Wednesday morning, it will mark the first time in their history of bargaining with the University that they have went on strike during the academic year. The last strike in 1983 occurred during the University’s summer recess.
Harvard has several options if the workers do go on strike. If past dining worker strikes at peer institutions like Yale are any guide, Harvard may elect to provide vouchers to undergraduates to dine at local eateries. The University could also hire temporary workers to staff dining halls.
Ten Eyck said workers were concerned about how their strike may affect students across the University.
“They believe in cooking,” Ten Eyck said. “How this will affect the students has been at the center of every decision they’ve made about the strike.”
Ahead of the strike deadline, Harvard’s dining workers have received an outpouring of student support from across Harvard’s many campuses. A rally last week in Harvard Yard drew over 400 Harvard affiliates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted 45-3 Sunday to endorse Harvard University Dining Services workers in their intent to strike should they not reach an agreement with the University over contract negotiations.
The endorsement comes a few days after UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers, announced that HUDS employees would strike beginning Wednesday if a “fair agreement” with the University is not reached by the night before. 
“HUDS workers are members of this community. As a UC body, we are elected to improve the lives of everyone in our community,” Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 said.
The UC’s vote was preceded by several rounds of contentious debate. Some representatives expressed concern that the Council was not adequately informed on both sides of the issue. Representatives from Harvard Student Labor Action Movement—a student group that supports HUDS—attended Sunday’s meeting, but some UC members noted that just one perspective may be insufficient.
“We have only heard one side of the story here,” Mather House representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19, who ultimately voted against the endorsement, said. “We didn't have a representative from the University. We didn't technically hear from them.”
UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said that although the Council tried to bring in a representative from the University to speak at the UC’s general meeting, schedule conflicts prevented that from happening.
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 acknowledged Boucher’s concerns, and cautioned the Council against voting without all of the facts.
“We have had only one group come present to us,” Banks said. “We shouldn't be voting based on our guts, we should be informed on both sides.”
Representatives from HUDS and the University have been in tense contracts talks since mid-June. Early last month, HUDS workers voted overwhelmingly to support a strike should the University not comply with their demands—increased wages and health benefits different than the proposed benefits, which would create lower salary tiers for premiums but increase copayments. Harvard, in turn, has proposed a 10 percent increase in hourly wages over five years, and points out that HUDS workers’ wages are, on average, higher than other food service workers’ wages in the region.
UC representatives also argued over the impact a potential strike would have on undergraduates. The University has indicated it has a “contingency plan” should HUDS strike, but spokespeople have not specified the details of that plan.
“Our main prerogative is towards the students who elected us to serve them,” Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18 said. “I'm failing to see how supporting this and endorsing this is helping the student body.”
“When students don't know where their next meal is going to come from... that's going to create a lot of uncertainty,” Ely, who ultimately voted in favor of endorsement, added.
The UC will release an open letter expressing support for HUDS workers by Wednesday.
Also during Sunday’s general meeting, the Council voted unanimously to allocate $51,607 from the UC’s Finance Committee to student organizations—predominantly club sports teams—during this week’s grants pack.
The Council also unanimously voted in favor of an amendment to the grants allocation, proposed by Boucher, who has served on the committee since last spring. The amendment allocated $2,107 to TEDxHarvardCollege, an organization which was denied UC funding last week due to concerns about the group’s finances.
Boucher conducted an audit of the organization’s expenditures last week, and concluded that the group did qualify for UC funding.
At the start of Sunday’s meeting, Native Americans at Harvard College President Damon J. Clark ’17 presented a memo to the Council urging the UC to support “the initiative for Harvard University to officially recognize the second Monday of October as ‘Indigenous People’s Day.’”
“I think just recognizing our history is something we really want to address,” Clark said. “We'd like to address this and talk to administrators.”
The Rules Committee will consider Clark’s petition for UC endorsement later this week before the proposal goes to a full Council vote, according to Rules Committee chair Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18
During the meeting, Rather announced that Currier House representative Ziyad J. McLean ’18 will serve as the Council’s new Parliamentarian.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will wait another month to discuss a motion opposing the College’s policy penalizing members of unrecognized single gender social organizations, according to computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, a vocal opponent of the new penalties and a signatory of the motion.
Although a version of this Tuesday’s Faculty meeting agenda includes a discussion of the motion, Lewis said some miscommunications between himself and members of the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body, spurred his decision to move the discussion of the motion.
“There was an honest misunderstanding of what the Council had discussed and how that affected the status of the motion,” Lewis wrote in an email. “By the time that was straightened out, I decided that even though the item was going to appear on the agenda for Tuesday, it was better to wait until November for the first discussion.”
He added that some of the motion's signatories will be observing Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and will not appear at Tuesday’s meeting.
While Lewis may present the motion to the full Faculty next month, the earliest date for a potential vote on the motion is December, in accordance with FAS meeting policies, Lewis wrote.
The motion, which 12 professors submitted last May, opposes sanctions against members of final clubs and Greek organizations, who, starting with the Class of 2021 will be ineligible for leadership roles in recognized clubs and Harvard endorsement for top fellowships like the Marshall and the Rhodes.
The motion’s signatories wrote that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join,” and argue that the policy infringes upon students’ freedom of association.
The vote’s delay means that many final club leaders who hope a Faculty vote approving the motion could strike down the sanctions will have to wait at least another month—or two—for certainty. It is unclear, however, if the Faculty vote in favor of the motion would override the College policy.
The next full Faculty meeting is scheduled for Nov. 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unsure whether Harvard University Dining Services workers will staff the dining halls Wednesday morning, some students said they would support workers in a potential strike, though others feel they do not know enough about the workers’ negotiations to take a firm stance.
Harvard’s dining workers announced last week that they intend to strike this Wednesday if Harvard and the HUDS' union do not reach a contract agreement by midnight Tuesday, months after the two parties began bargaining in mid-June.
Some students said they are forming their opinions from information disseminated by groups that support HUDS' potential strike. But some said they are uncertain what both sides have offered in the negotiations, what impact a strike could have on their dining, or how long a strike might last.
“I don’t know what to really expect for the strike, but I am on the side of the HUDS workers,” Rachel E. Clemens ’19 said, adding that she felt most other students she knew sided with HUDS.
Marcella J. Park ’19 said she was sympathetic to HUDS because their efforts have involved connecting with students. 
"The dining hall workers are people, too," she said.
The Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate group that has rallied behind HUDS workers during the most recent round of contract talks with the University, has urged undergraduates to sign up for shifts on a picket line should the workers strike on Wednesday. The organization is hosting what they describe as a “dine-in” Thursday, during which students would bring their trays from the dining halls to eat with HUDS workers in front of Mass. Hall. As of Monday evening, more than 200 people had indicated they would attend the event on Facebook.
Some of their members also spoke to the Undergraduate Council ahead of the body’s vote on whether to support the strike. After a contentious debate, the UC voted 45-3 to endorse the strike, should it occur. Despite an overwhelming majority siding with HUDS, some students raised concerns that no University position was presented to the council, and several representatives said they did not feel well enough informed on the issue.
Though some students felt inclined to support HUDS, others said they did not know enough about the specifics of the negotiations to have an informed position on the strike.
Evan S. Mateen ’20 said that though he understands the gist of the negotiations—which hinge on disagreements over health benefits and wage increases—he was hesitant to immediately support one side over the other.
“I understand why that is a difficult situation for them and why they would be striking to maintain the higher level of health care benefits, but beyond that, I am not really sure what else is occurring at the moment,” Mateen said.
Student support for the strike is not unanimous, however.
“[HUDS] is not striking because they’re underpaid relative to their compatriots in the area, they’re striking because they have a lot of leverage,” Kyle G. Sargent ’19 said.
Sargent said he believed that threatening a strike was opportunistic at a time when Harvard’s endowment returns have performed poorly and the University’s sanctions on single-gender organizations is facing backlash. Sargent said that HUDS workers were already overpaid for their field—they make more hourly than the average dining services worker in the region. He said increasing their salary would be “ridiculous” given that workers do not generally work over breaks; he also does not like the quality of the food.
Students were uncertain how a strike would affect the dining halls, some of which are currently stockpiling frozen food. Some expressed confidence in the College to keep students fed; others said they would wait for further notice from administrators.
“I haven’t really thought about it to be honest,” Clemens said. “But I think [the negotiations] are more important than me being inconvenienced, if that’s what you could call it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A light rain during Saturday night’s game at Jordan field gave way in the second half to a rousing comeback for the Harvard women’s soccer team.
The Crimson found itself down 1-0 early against Yale, and for over an hour, it dominated the ball, sending in cross after cross, but unable to find an opening in the Bulldog’s resilient defense.
The breakthrough came in the 74th minute, off of a free kick from near-midfield by sophomore defender/midfielder Leah Mohammadi that senior forward Rachel Garcia headed backwards towards fellow senior Midge Purce. The star forward one-timed the ball into the lower left corner for her ninth goal and 20th point of the season.
With new life breathed into the team, Harvard scored again less than seven minutes later to complete the comeback, taking the victory, 2-1. The victory extended the Crimson’s (7-3-0, 2-0 Ivy League) winning streak to five games, while Yale (4-4-3, 0-1-1) still has yet to win within the conference.
Junior midfielder Caroline Chagares tallied the game-winning goal, once again assisted by Mohammadi. The goal was the first of Chagares’ Harvard career, and the timing couldn’t be more perfect to achieve such a milestone.
“One goal down, we just had to keep fighting,” Chagares said. “Keep the ball moving, keep going forward and do our thing. Yale is a great team, and we were happy to get the win.”
Mohammadi’s second assist, this time from the left corner, arched inwards towards a mass of jerseys, and Chagares was able to head the ball into the top right corner.
“I think that in the first half, our message was, we could easily be up by a goal or two, and we’re not—we’re down,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “I was really, really proud of the patience and the maturity we showed, just to keep plugging away. Just chip away at them and break them down.”
Yale freshman Aerial Chavarin gave the Bulldogs the 1-0 lead when she headed a through ball over senior goalie Lizzie Durack in the eighth minute of the game. The freshman has been a bright spot for Yale, as she now has eight goals on the season.
The Crimson played well from that point onwards, controlling possession for the vast majority of the game, and when it did lose possession, it always got the ball back soon thereafter.
“These are the games in which we had a lot of the ball, we had a lot of opportunities,” Hamblin said. “We knew that Yale would be a very strong defensive team in the way that their shape was, with five defenders and three midfielders. We knew we’d have to be patient to break them down.”
Harvard ended up outshooting the Bulldogs 17-2, and on the defensive end in the second half, generally weren’t threatened until scrappy play set in in the final ten minutes, when Durack and the defense were able to thwart all attempts.
Mohammadi, whose two assists on the night gave her a team-leading three on the season, emphasized how the team effort complemented the team’s two goals coming from set-piece plays.
“We played a well-rounded game overall,” Mohammadi said. “[The set pieces] were just another small part that we practiced all week, but the most important part was that we played 90 minutes as hard as we could.”
The end of the game suffered from a bit of controversy from the Yale side after the clock continued to run after a corner kick was awarded to the visitors. With just a few seconds left in the game, the clock hit zero before the Bulldogs could get set, but the game was called officially over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy weekend for the Harvard sailing team, with Crimson sailors competing at six regattas over two days. Although the difficulties of the team’s full racing schedule were further compounded by some tricky conditions, Harvard managed to secure a handful of solid finishes, highlighted by two top-three marks, in a weekend of mixed results.
“This was a cold, rainy weekend that made for some tough sailing conditions,” sophomore skipper Nick Karnovsky said. “While our score lines weren’t quite as strong as in our other regattas, we gained invaluable experience that will surely help us next weekend”
HARVARD INVITATIONAL
Harvard began the weekend in promising fashion with a top-ten result in its second and final home regatta of the fall season. Racing in FJs under cloudy skies, the Crimson ended up sixth of 12 teams.
The weather was overcast on the Charles River, but the wind was strong, and Harvard took advantage, as both the A and B boats cracked the top three in several races. A series of bottom-half finishes sank the team’s hopes of a top-five finish, however. In the end, crosstown rival Boston University edged Harvard out for fifth place by one point.
MYSTIC LAKE INVITATIONAL
The Crimson overcame a lack of wind to pick up its highest finish of the weekend at the one-day regatta hosted by Tufts. Sailing in Larks, Harvard posted 32 points to end up second out of eight teams, 12 points off of Tufts’ second entry and 20 points ahead of the Tufts first entry.
Relatively windless conditions meant that the fifth race of the day was cancelled, but the Crimson A duo of freshman skipper Jessica Williams and sophomore crew picked up a first place finish in the fourth race to ensure second place overall for Harvard. The race also saw the Crimson A boat finish first in points on the day.
REGIS BOWL
Harvard ended up on the winning side of some very tight margins to pick up a third-place result in the Boston University-hosted, all women’s regatta. The Crimson’s 130 points were just enough to see them past fourth-place University of Vermont on a tiebreaker, with Roger Williams and Rhode Island a mere one and three points behind, respectively.
Harvard was able to secure the result thanks to some strong sailing from the A boat of sophomore skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Emma Wheeler. The pair finished inside the top three in four of ten races, picking up two first-place marks along the way.
DANMARK TROPHY
The Crimson was unable to match its third-place result from last year in the two-day, bi-divisional regatta, hosted by Coast Guard, as the team finished the weekend 16th out of 20 programs. In the end, inconsistency and mistakes condemned Harvard to a bottom-half result.
The Crimson A boat of junior skipper Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Christine Gosioco picked up a handful of top-three finishes, including a win in the 10th race, but they were unable to consistently replicate their success. A number of results outside of the top 10, as well as a disqualification for the B boat of sophomore skipper Jackson Wagner and sophomore crew Catherine Tang sealed Harvard’s fate.
HEWITT TROPHY
Sailing in FJs, the Crimson fought through perhaps the most challenging, variable conditions of the weekend to pick up 155 points en-route to an eighth-place finish out of 15 schools at the in-conference, tri-divisional regatta hosted by Dartmouth.
“The breeze was really up and down in velocity, and the wind shifts were pretty unpredictable, so you had to be really mentally in it all day,” junior skipper Taylor Ladd said. “It was tough conditions and we learned a lot.”
Ladd and sophomore crew Kristin Anderson had an especially strong weekend in the B boat, notching a handful of top-five results to keep Harvard in a competitive position. In the end, Yale took top marks, with host Dartmouth and Coast guard more than 100 points behind in second and third, respectively.
GEORGE WARREN SMITH TROPHY
Led by a strong showing from its B boat, the Crimson sailed to a solid finish at the two-day, MIT-hosted regatta. Despite finishing behind a quartet of local rivals, Harvard capped a successful weekend on the Charles by ending up in fifth place out of 19 teams. Tufts, Brown, BU, and Northeastern, listed in order of finish, took the top four spots.
After a slow start, the Crimson B boat of sophomore skipper Andrew Puopolo and freshman crew Tancredi Castellano Pucci Di Barsento notched a string of competitive finishes to keep Harvard in top-five position. The duo did not finish outside of the first six places for eight races in a row, coming away with two victories along the way to help consolidate the team’s lead over sixth-place MIT.

No. 8 Harvard went 2-1 on the weekend in its fourth week of play. After sweeping the competition last week in the Bison Invitational, the Crimson picked up additional wins this week against Iona and No. 14 Princeton. The team’s first loss since the opening week of the season, and only second loss overall, came to St. Francis. With this weekend's results, the team continues its impressive run to start the season.
“It’s family ball as our coach calls it,” sophomore defender Grant Harvey said. “We’re playing Harvard water polo the way we always wanted to play it. We don’t have any of those selfish players who want to have the glory for themselves, they just want what’s best for the team. I think that’s what it is, everyone’s on the same page; everyone’s grinding and we all rejoice the same no matter who scores the goal because that’s all that matters”
HARVARD 8, PRINCETON 7
Following the loss to St Francis, Harvard returned to action on Sunday, facing off with No. 14 Princeton in Ivy league play.
“We definitely tried to put the last game against St Francis behind us,” sophomore goalie Anthony Ridgley said. “It was definitely a disappointing loss but you need to take everything in the present, the now, and that’s the only way to face an opponent, with a clear head. So we went in with the mentality that we had to get out and get after really early. Our counterattack and our defense are our biggest strength and we definitely got out on them early and took a 4-0 and had a good control over the game the entire time.”
The Crimson raced out to a four goal lead in the first quarter with help from senior defender Dan Stevens, senior attacker Joey Colton, freshman defender Benny Seybold, and junior utility player Colin Chiapello. However, Princeton responded in the second quarter with strong defense and three goals of its own to make it a 4-3 game going into halftime.
Stevens and senior attacker Viktor Wrobel scored in the third, and Harvard went into the fourth quarter with a 6-4 advantage. In the fourth, the Tigers quickly scored three goals to retake the lead. With 2:30 remaining in the game, Chiapello scored to even up the game; a minute later, Ridgley played an outlet pass to senior attacker Noah Harrison, who tucked it in behind the Princeton keeper for the score. With the goal, Harrison extended his scoring streak to 14 consecutive games.
“We knew we had to create movement and stick to our gameplan the entire game,” Ridgley, who finished with 11 saves and two assists, said. “We did that and we executed and even with varying scores the entire time we knew we had control and we had trust in our system and the system prevailed in the end.”
ST. FRANCIS 10, HARVARD 7
The Crimson’s second contest Saturday saw the team fall behind in the first quarter and struggle to come back against St. Francis Brooklyn’s attack. Harrison scored early in the first quarter. Sophomore attackers Nick Bunn, Grayson Judge, and Nathan Ondracek also scored for Harvard, with Bunn’s two goals leading the team. Ridgley started the game, finishing with three saves, one assist, and four steals. Freshman Nikhil Suri would later replace Ridgely, recording four saves of his own.
The conditions of the pool played a role in the Crimson’s performance on Saturday.
“When we always go on our New York trips, it’s always an interesting experience,” Harvey said. “Both of those schools we play in aren’t really a regulation water polo pool but it’s what the school has and what we have to, unfortunately, play in...We were able to overcome it in Iona but at St Francis we weren’t able to beat them in their own pool. However, we look forward to them coming to our big pool, what we call our big water, and taking us on here at home, because we like our chances a lot”.
HARVARD 16, IONA 10
After finishing a tough first quarter tied up 4-4, Harvard turned to Harrison, who responded with a career day. Harrison scored three of his career high eight goals in the second quarter. Stevens scored the Crimson’s fourth and final goal of the quarter, and Harvard went into the half with an 8-7 advantage.
Defense was the theme of the third quarter, as the Crimson held Iona scoreless and scored five goals of their own, increasing the lead to 13-7. Bunn started off the quarter with a goal. Harrison struck again this quarter, scoring four straight goals and finishing with a career high seven steals. Seybold and freshman attacker Austin Sechrest scored two goals and one goal one assist, respectively, to carry the offense in the fourth quarter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Split between coasts, the Harvard cross country women and men both had impressive meets against deep fields of runners. The women traveled across the nation to compete in the Washington Invitational while the men stayed near the east coast to compete at the Paul Short Invitational
WASHINGTON INVITATIONAL
Coming of her individual victory at the season opener, junior Courtney Smith led the Crimson to a third place finish at the Washington Invitational, hosted by the University of Washington at Jefferson Park Golf Course.
Finishing a close fourth—behind Oregon’s Katie Rainsberger and Washington’s Charlotte Prouse, who won the race and Amy-Eloise Neale—Smith recorded her fastest 6K time in a competition with Harvard with a time of 19:47.6.
Freshman Lisa Tertsch was the other Crimson athlete who finished in the top-10, beating many runners from Washington, Oregon and everyone from Colorado St., three of the top teams in the country.
“The stand out performance definitely came from Lisa in her first ever collegiate cross country meet. She really stepped up and executed an incredible race,” Smith said. “I think it's a good life lesson of what can happen when you don't put limits on yourself because she had no idea what to expect going into the race so she didn't put a cap on what she could do”
Fellow rookie Judy Pendergrast crossed the line less than 20 seconds after Tertsch, finishing with a time of 20:39.20, good for 20th, while sophomore Erin Dietz was just over a second behind to finish in 21st.
Junior Elianna Shwayder capped off the scoring contingent for Harvard finishing in 27th place with a 20:55.60. The Crimson finished off with 78 points, just 21 points behind the fourth ranked Ducks. The trip was a special experience for the Harvard women, as the meet is one of the few chances the team will get to compete on the West Coast.
“One of the luckiest parts of being on the team is traveling. It's a really special thing we get to do, to explore the world with our best friends doing what we love,” Smith explained. “I think it's important sometimes to step back from the stress and busyness within the Harvard bubble and just remember to enjoy life and appreciate how lucky we are.”
PAUL SHORT INVITATIONAL
Across the country in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the Crimson men raced in one of the largest annual cross country meets in the nation and finished in 13th place overall.
In the men's gold 8K race, sophomore Kieran Tuntivate finished first for the Crimson with a time of 24:14, coming in 29th place in a very deep field.
“The biggest performance was sophomore Kieran Tuntivate who ran 24:14 which was over a minute faster than his previous best,”  senior captain Brandon Pierce said.
Price was close behind Tuntivate, crossing the line with a 24:20 time to finish in 39th place. The underclassmen continued to make their mark as freshmen teammates Murimi Nyamu and Will Battershill finished as the third and fourth Harvard runners in 79th and 94th place.
Junior Gabe Montague rounded out the scoring contingent with a 25:44 finish, as the team finished with 443 points, good for 13th out of 38 teams.
At this point in the season, the Harvard cross country teams are focused on training hard and learning from each experience.
“We went into Paul Short knowing that it was still early in the season and that we were training hard at this point.  Because of that we had no expectations and just executed,” Price said.
Next weekend, both the Harvard men and women return to race at home in the New England Cross Country Championships at Franklin Park in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Split between coasts, the Harvard cross country women and men both had impressive meets against deep fields of runners. The women traveled across the nation to compete in the Washington Invitational while the men stayed on the east coast to compete at the Paul Short Invitational.
WASHINGTON INVITATIONAL
Coming off of her individual victory at the season opener, junior Courtney Smith led the Crimson to a third-place finish at the Washington Invitational, hosted by the University of Washington at Jefferson Park Golf Course.
Finishing a close fourth—behind Washington’s Charlotte Prouse, Oregon’s Katie Rainsberger, and the Huskies’ Amy-Eloise Neale—Smith recorded her fastest 6K time in a competition with Harvard with a time of 19:47.6.
Freshman Lisa Tertsch was the other Crimson athlete who finished in the top 10, topping many runners from Washington and Oregon as well as all of the runners from Colorado State. All three schools boast some of the top women’s programs in the country.
“The stand-out performance definitely came from Lisa in her first ever collegiate cross country meet. She really stepped up and executed an incredible race,” Smith said. “I think it's a good life lesson of what can happen when you don't put limits on yourself because she had no idea what to expect going into the race so she didn't put a cap on what she could do”
Fellow rookie Judy Pendergrast crossed the line less than 20 seconds after Tertsch, finishing with a time of 20:39.20, good for 20th, while sophomore Erin Dietz was just over a second behind to bring home a 21st-place finish.
Junior Elianna Shwayder capped off the scoring contingent for Harvard, finishing in 27th place with a 20:55.60. The Crimson finished off with 78 points, just 21 points behind the fourth-ranked Ducks. The trip was a special experience for the Harvard women, as the meet is one of the few chances the team will get to compete on the West Coast.
“One of the luckiest parts of being on the team is traveling,” Smith said. “It's a really special thing we get to do, to explore the world with our best friends doing what we love. I think it's important sometimes to step back from the stress and busyness within the Harvard bubble and just remember to enjoy life and appreciate how lucky we are.”
PAUL SHORT INVITATIONAL
Across the country in Bethlehem, Pa., the Crimson men raced in one of the largest annual cross country meets in the nation and finished 13th.
In the men's gold 8K race, sophomore Kieran Tuntivate finished first for the Crimson with a time of 24:14, coming in 29th place in a very deep field.
“The biggest performance was sophomore Kieran Tuntivate who ran 24:14, which was over a minute faster than his previous best,”  senior captain Brandon Pierce said.
Price was close behind Tuntivate, crossing the line with a 24:20 to finish in 39th place. The underclassmen continued to make their mark as freshmen teammates Murimi Nyamu and Will Battershill finished as the third and fourth Harvard runners in 79th and 94th place, respectively.
Junior Gabe Montague rounded out the scoring contingent with a 25:44 finish, as the team finished with 443 points, good for 13th out of 38 teams.
At this point in the season, the Harvard cross country teams are focused on training hard and learning from each experience.
“We went into Paul Short knowing that it was still early in the season and that we were training hard at this point.  Because of that we had no expectations and just executed,” Price said.
Next weekend, both the Harvard men and women return to race at home in the New England Cross Country Championships at Franklin Park in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking the course for the third time this fall, the Harvard men’s golf team traveled to New Haven, Conn. looking to defend its MacDonald Cup title from a season ago. After 54 holes of play over the weekend, the Crimson was able to squeak out a win by two strokes, hoisting the trophy once more.
Heading into play Sunday, Harvard found itself trailing Stirling University by two shots. However, the Crimson was able to rebound, recapturing the lead it had lost in round two by firing a 277. Stirling put together a team total of 281 in round three, cementing a runner-up finish.
“Our team is in a really good place right now,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “They looked that way last week at Dartmouth; they really looked that way this week. There were some extenuating circumstances with [the] round being really long and having to finish holes at sunrise on Sunday, but it didn’t seem to affect the way our guys played.”
The tournament, hosted by the Yale Bulldogs, took place at The Course at Yale, which played at a par 70 over the weekend. The course features two par five holes, as well as four par threes.
Placing third was fellow Ancient Eight squad Yale, which rode a third-round shot count of 274 to move four spots up the leaderboard. That output was good enough to put the Bulldogs six strokes under par Sunday, the best round three total of any school.
Also finishing in the top 10 was Toledo, UConn, Boston College, a second team from Yale, Hartford, and Rutgers.
On the individual side of play, Harvard was led by senior Robert Deng. Deng’s five-under finish was good enough to position him fourth out of 88 entrants. His first round 65 put him five shots below the watermark, behind only eventual champion Matt Naumec of Boston College and Nabeel Khan of Connecticut.
“We are enjoying a really fun space right now with a team that is both very deep and very good,” Rhoads said. “For Rob, he had to miss the first tournament due to family funeral, but he’s been able to come back and finish second last week and fourth this week, so he’s really overcome any setbacks from missing play.”
Yale’s Li Wang finished with the top individual score among Ivy League players, riding a seven-under to a finish in second place. He came into play Sunday tied with Naumec for the lead.
Junior Greg Royston sandwiched round one and three scores of 69 around a round two output of 72, leaving him at even par overall and in seventh place. Sophomore Seiya Liu ended as part of an eight-man tie for 16th at four-over. Senior Kendrick Vinar was one stroke behind him, tying with two others for 24th. Rounding out the squad for Harvard on the weekend was freshman Rij Patel, finishing tied for 33rd.
Several players for the Crimson had to finish their round two holes early Sunday, as darkness postponed play Saturday night. In accordance with tournament rules, these players are not allowed practice prior to the completion of the round.
“The way we’ve been working on thinking on the course is how to approach things the right way,” Royston said. “It’s a part of golf that things don’t always go your way, like having to finish the round two holes on Sunday, but we were able to retain composure and put forth our best effort.”
Princeton, Dartmouth, and Penn joined Harvard and Yale to represent the Ivy League, finishing fourth, 12th, and tied for 15th, respectively. 17 schools took part in the tournament overall.
Additional teams who competed over the weekend were East Tennessee State, Fordham, Sacred Heart, St. Edward’s, and Fairfield.
The Crimson will take three weeks off from tournament play before next traveling to South Carolina to take part in the Camden Collegiate Invitational to conclude the fall half of its split season.

The Harvard women’s field hockey team found itself in a very familiar position this weekend against University of Pennsylvania. The Crimson (6-4, 2-0 Ivy) fought through yet another double-overtime to overcome the Quakers (6-3, 1-1 Ivy), 3-2, and continue on undefeated in Ivy League play. This is the third Crimson game this season that has gone into overtime.
“I think we came out and played very well,” said coach Tjerk van her Waarden. “I think in the second half we kind of let go a little bit of our swing and we knew that Penn was going to be dangerous team. So we had to go into overtime. Again!”
Balleza’s 88th minute game winning goal was her second of the day—she converted a short corner head-on and managed to steal a victory yet again.
“Marissa has been doing what she’s been doing her whole entire career,” van her Waarden said. “We were all tied up and she was able to get the goal in overtime. I think that really tells you a lot about who she is and what she is made of. I don’t know how many game-winning goals she has scored in her career but I know it has been a few…she is able to stand up and do the right thing at the right moment.”
Balleza’s second goal of the night means she is tied for second in the Harvard history books for most game-winning goals in her college career. Chloe Keating ’11 and Balleza both have scored 10 game-winning goals for the Crimson. Balleza already has 16 points this season, bringing her career total to 96—only six fewer than the current Crimson record.
Balleza’s first goal of the night put Harvard up 2-0 in the second half. Senior defender Sophie van Weede got the Crimson on the board with her first goal of the season in the 25th minute. However, Harvard’s hopes of winning the match in normal time were dashed when Penn’s Alexa Hoover retaliated with two goals in the second half at the 45th and 63rd minutes.
“We were up two nothing and it would’ve been really nice to end the game in regular time,” co-captain Kyla Cordrey said. “We let up two goals in the second half and it was a little disappointing. But we kind of got back into our groove in the second overtime and we were able to win in overtime which is always exciting.”
Sophomore goalkeeper Libby Manela continued to start for the Crimson and made four saves during this weekend’s game. Manela improves her record as goalkeeper to 4-0.
“Sometimes we need people to stand up and lead the team and I think Libby did that today,”  van her Waarden said. “A goalkeeper is able to do that just by her presence. She is able to give them an extra push and I think Libby showed up in a big big way today.”
The Quakers are the second Ivy League opponent that the Crimson has played so far this season. With last week’s victory over Yale, Harvard moves forward in Ivy League play as one of three undefeated teams. The Crimson is joined by No. 11 Princeton and Brown as the only teams who have not yet lost a game. Harvard will continue its conference play with a game against the Bears next Saturday in Providence.
“The next game is the biggest game – our next game is against Brown,” said Cordrey. “Right now we are going to focus on Brown for the next week and hopefully we will be the only team left undefeated in the Ivy League.”

Entering its second tournament thus far on the season, the Harvard women’s golf team traveled south to compete in the Princeton Invitational. In its first three round event of the season, the Crimson walked away with a ninth place finish.
The tournament took place at the Springdale Golf Course. The 6,100 yard course played at a par 72 for the weekend. The course features two par five holes and four par threes. Two rounds were played throughout the day Saturday, with one additional round taking place Sunday.
After the conclusion of play Sunday, Ancient Eight squad Columbia walked out of Princeton, N.J. hoisting the championship trophy, two shots ahead of Georgetown. The next four finishers all hailed from the Ivy League, with Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Penn placing third through sixth, respectively. Brown was also in attendance.
Other school that took part in the event were Rollins College, Delaware, and Lehigh. As hosts, Princeton fielded two squads at the tournament.
Harvard went into the tournament with a depleted lineup. Captain Anne Cheng traveled with the team and was in the original lineup, however a wrist injury kept her out of play for the weekend. It was the first tournament Cheng has missed due to injury in her career. As a result, the Crimson was only able to utilize four players on the scoring team of the five that were allowed.
Freshman Chloe Belle Hooton has also been sidelined since the opening tournament of the season with a muscle injury in her side.
Due to injuries, the Crimson was forced to call on walk on freshman Ji Hae Lee to step in and assume a place on the scoring team.
“I’m very proud of what Ji Hae Lee was able to do for us this weekend after being thrust into a challenging situation,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “She had a tough first round, but came back pretty nicely in her second and third rounds, which helps us when we’re dealing with these injuries we haven’t had over the past few seasons.”
12 schools took part in the event overall. In its ninth place result, Harvard finished three shots behind Delaware, but 18 strokes ahead of Brown.
Round two was Harvard’s lowest score of the three, as the Crimson shot a 305 in the second half of play Saturday.
On the individual side, sophomore Michelle Xie jumped out of the gates by firing a -4 68 in round one. She never looked back, holding onto the top slot throughout the course of the tournament en route to the individual title. She finished six strokes in front of her nearest competition, represented by Jennifer Peng of Yale, Camilla Vik of Columbia, and Christina Park of Penn.
“Despite conditions not being ideal for our team, everyone was still able to rally together and individually stay on top of our games,” Xie said. “Everyone was able to focused throughout the weekend, which is a real credit to our coaching and the team chemistry we have.”
Fellow sophomore Anna Zhou finished as part of a tie for 13th out of 66 competitors in the event. Senior Nina Fairbairn ended play as part of a group of five women tied for 32nd.
Of the top nine players on the individual leaderboard, eight of them hailed from Ivy League schools. Jacquelyn Eleey of Georgetown, who finished as part of a five-way tie for fifth place, was the only exception.
“I like to see that the other Ivy League schools are playing well at this stage of the season,” Rhoads said. “It provides an affirmation about how high the quality of competition in the league is, and just provides us with that additional incentive that each of us individually needs to keep doing our best to move forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the ball floating in the air and just under 12 seconds left in the second overtime frame, it only seemed right it would find the back of the net after almost 110 minutes of crazy back and forth action between the Harvard and Yale men’s soccer teams.
As it found its way into a frantic Yale box, it was redirected towards goal by Crimson junior forward Christian Sady. But just like in the rest of the frame, Harvard was denied the game-winning goal as the ball hit the post and the referee called a foul as time expired to seal the game.
The sequence was part of a thrilling 3-3 draw between the Crimson (4-3-2, 0-0-1 Ivy) and the Bulldogs (1-3-2, 0-0-1), as both teams saw leads disappear in a back and forth affair that served as the Ancient Eight opener for both teams.
After falling behind 2-0 with 35 minutes to go, Harvard looked to have mounted a stunning comeback with three goals in the span of less than 20 minutes, but Yale pulled it back with just three minutes remaining in the second stanza, as Bulldog captain Henry Flugstad Clarke found the back of the net to even the score. Though both teams had close chances in overtime, neither was able to come away with the victory.
“We went down early which is always tough in these kinds of games but our intensity is very consistent” Sady said. “We’re fighters so we’re fortunate to come back into it but I’d like to have that one back.”
Despite coming out with high pressure and registering the first three shots of the game, Harvard continued its trend of falling behind when forward Kyle Kenagy’s goal gave Yale the lead. After a no-call for a penalty in the Yale box following the takedown of Crimson freshman forward Phillip Housen, the Bulldogs quickly counterattacked and gained a corner. Kenagy met the cross near the far post and sent it into the top left corner.
The lead doubled for the Bulldogs in the second frame, as Harvard junior Tyler Savitsky fluffed a ball from junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks, allowing Yale rookie John Leisman to send a shot from outside the area into the bottom right corner past a diving Parks.
“It’s a hard one,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We’re competing and we’re trying to get in a position where we score early but we keep putting ourselves in a spot where we’re not so we’ll look at it and make adjustments.”
It took just less than five minutes for Harvard to respond, as Sady sent a rocket towards Yale goalkeeper Kees Schipper. The sophomore was unable to control the ball, allowing senior forward Jake Freeman to tap in the rebound to bring the Crimson within one.
Senior defender Daniel Smith evened the scoreline in the 76th minute for Harvard, soaring into the box to head in the goal as Sady played facilitator once again.
“[Coming back] is very common for the guys,” Lehrer said. “They do that in training every day. They fight and compete regardless of the score, that part they’re not really phased as much, being down. They’ll continue to compete regardless of what the scoreboard is [and] it’s huge that they do that.”
The momentum continued for the Crimson less than two minutes later, as a missed tackle allowed Sady to collect the ball and initiate a rapid counterattack. With the Yale backline in disarray, the junior laid it off outside the box to freshman midfielder Matthew Glass, who cut back to get rid of his man before blasting the ball into the mesh to give Harvard the lead. Sady was credited with his third assist of the game, a career high for the junior.
With time winding down, the Crimson looked to close out the match and open Ivy League play with a victory but the Bulldogs had other plans. Off a long free kick played into the box, Kengay redirected the ball into the path of Flugstad-Clark, who beat the Harvard defenders in the air and headed it past Parks.
The two overtime periods presented various chances for both teams to take the lead. A miscommunication between Parks and the defense in the box allowed a routine ball to turn into a standing, close range header from Flugstad-Clark that hit the crossbar before going out, while Sady sent a shot just wide three seconds before the end of overtime.
In the second extra frame, the Crimson continued to pile the pressure offensively but were unable to find the back of the net. The last 30 seconds of the game proved particularly frustrating as junior midfielder Eric Gylling saw his close effort off a corner narrowly saved by Schipper before Sady’s last second shot hit the post.
Though the team was unable to pick up a vital Ancient Eight victory, it looks to regroup and pick up the win against a scrappy Cornell squad next weekend. With the Crimson sitting in a six way tie for first at one point along with favorites Princeton and Dartmouth, there is still plenty at stake for Lehrer’s men, who will look to improve on their performance.
“[We need] to have a good week of training, it starts there.” Sady said. “Like I said before, we just approach [Cornell] the same way we did today and I think we’ll come out on top…. Set pieces, we’ve got to focus on that and just staying consistent...if we do those two things we’ll be good to go.”

The Harvard women’s rugby team (3-1, 1-1 Ivy League) saw its first three games pass with a large amount of charm, outscoring its opponents 131-22 over the course of the opening few weeks of the season.
The fourth game, however, the team did not encounter the same amount of success, falling to fellow Ivy foe Dartmouth (4-1, 3-0) on Saturday in its second straight conference match-up. Despite Harvard having the ability to control the ball for a majority of the game, the Crimson ultimately fell to the Big Green, 22-19, for its first loss of the season.
“Yesterday’s game was a wake up call for us,” junior Maya Learned said. “It was definitely the hardest competition we’ve had the whole season. Some of our players felt pretty down about it but we have to look forward and only improve from here.”
Despite trailing 12-0 in the opening half of play, Harvard was able to mount a comeback that brought the team within five late in the first period following a try and a successful conversion, putting seven point on the board for the visitors.
Early in the second half Dartmouth grew its lead to double digits, pulling ahead 17-7 before the Crimson once again brought the lead within five. The defensive effort from the Big Green was strong, keeping Harvard’s offense at bay and forcing multiple turnovers throughout the course of play.
“Dartmouth has a really strong pressure defense so even when we did have the ball we were under a lot of pressure and getting pushed back but I think our forwards were really strong and our set pieces were really strong and we were able to win the ball back after a lot of turnovers,” senior Claire Collins said. “There was a lot of back and forth on the field and we were able to play where we wanted to play in their attacking end, but their fast defense made it hard for us to execute our game plan.”
Dartmouth’s offense was headed by freshman Isabel Boettcher, who scored three tries in the game.
Late in the second half, the Crimson was able to mount a comeback on the pitch, scoring a try and converting in the 77th minute of play that brought the team within three points of the hosts. The Big Green defense was able to hold strong for the final three minutes of the game, as the score stood at 22-19 in the books.
“I felt like we had a very strong chance of winning, we just didn’t capitalize on tops of the little things in our plays and it cost us but… I think they [Dartmouth] had very different strengths that our team,” Learned said. “They have very different strengths in their backs and we have strengths in our forwards which makes it come out to very different forms of play.”

With all the bowties and bullsh!t that continue to flow around campus, it’s clear that recruiting season isn’t ending anytime soon. If you’re a junior or senior still considering consulting as a career (or a freshman who is already attending OCS career sessions and prepping with cases), this time of year is inherently stressful. To simplify your introspection and facilitate your career exploration, Flyby has outlined the various skill sets that many of you already possess based on your academic concentrations at Harvard. This evidence-based (don’t ask for citations) report describes those skills which are seamlessly translatable to a job at any top management consulting firm. See if your concentration is below!
English: you’re really good at making meaning out of nonsense.
Economics: you’re good at Excel.
Statistics: you’re better at Excel.
Applied Mathematics: you’ve been training for this job since Day 1.
Chemistry: you know how to avoid toxic meltdowns in the workplace.
Astrophysics: you’re already comfortable managing out-of-this-world working hours.
Folklore and Mythology: you’re a Jedi master who will be able to convince your clients that the service you’re providing is totally worth the hundreds of thousands of dollars your employer is charging. Alternatively, you read Harry Potter in class so you understand how to use a Time Turner to ensure that you have enough hours in your day to complete all the work that will pile up on your desk.
Government: you’re experienced at making good friends in even better places. Now, you’re ready to take advantage of them.
Philosophy: you’ve already contemplated your existence and greater purpose in life, so why waste any more of it in a low-paying field?
Sometime down the road, your secondary field might help you make that crucial pivot into private equity (you know, the one you've had in the back of your mind since this grueling recruiting season began). Until then, onward with case prep!

Starting freshman year of college can be a big change. It's likely the first time that you're living away from home, with little to no supervision. Naturally, this means that freshmen can be known for occasionally doing stupid stuff, like getting too drunk, hoarding food, or just being plain rude. We all know that kid. We all have been that kid. So if you do these things…just stop right now, we beg you.
Swiping the last 20 cookies “for later” and stashing them in the large container you brought from your room. The sad person behind you is forced to come to terms with their cookie-less milk.
Filling up your 1L water bottle that has been your best friend ever since FOP and gives you something to do during math lecture. But seriously, no one has the two minutes that it takes for the slow trickle of the water fountain to keep you hydrated.
“Merging” at the front of the tray return line at 12:59 right before LS1a (and why haven’t you figured out that this just isn’t a good time to return your tray?). Or maybe you sneak in the “out” direction of tray return and knock into an angry wrestler. Or you don’t even bother with a tray anymore and you force other people to clear your plates on their trays so you can avoid the 12:59 rush.
Leaving your sandwich in the griddle to burn while you flirt with the guy from CS50 in front of the soda fountain (please get out of the way there, too, and let other people get their drinks). Even worse, you put your sandwich in the middle of the griddle so there is no space for anyone else’s.
Taking zoom-in Snapchats of your friends from the balcony as they awkwardly shovel salad into their mouths. Or worse, accidentally letting tourists sneak in the back entrance and are take photos for their vacation album.
If you laughed knowingly at any of these Annenberg faux pas, on behalf of the freshman class, all we can say to you is: dude, that’s rude.

After dealing with a sudden blackout that left some stranded, we thought there wouldn’t be any more surprises. But here comes the news of the HUDS strike that could start on Wednesday.  Since we don’t know Harvard’s plans for feeding us during the impending strike, other than rumors of frozen mac and cheese as far as the eye can see, it’s probably wise to starting buying as many expensive supplies from the Square as possible.
But like a ray of sunshine in our dark & rainy day, a hero comes in to make our day just a little brighter.  And the hero of this tale is C’est Bon, which is valiantly offering 10 percent off purchases if you show your student ID. Yes, C’est Bon is the Batman to Harvard Square’s Gotham.
It is not the first time that C’est Bon came in clutch during the cold. And though this deal had existed weeks before news of the strike, it seemingly came at just the right time.
But now, for every wine bottle you buy for your next presidential drinking game, you save some money for important things like a slice of Noch’s or a late night Uber ride.  In fact, just by showing your Harvard ID with your state ID you’re actually one step closer to being a responsible adult by saving money every time you buy PBR or Franzia.

We all know that HUDS alone will not cause the Freshman (or Sophomore, or Junior, or Senior) 15. Despite having sat through countless lectures about how important sleep is and knowing that eating right before bed is pretty much the worst thing for our metabolisms, we somehow all manage to find ourselves wandering around the Square late at night itching for something to satisfy our cravings. Whether you’re up past midnight studying hard or partying hard, where your late night food excursions lead you says something about who you are.
Tasty Burger This is probably the only restaurant in Harvard Square that sells more food between 12am-2am than in the rest of the day combined. Obviously this is because grease leads way to a great post party recovery. If you find yourself stumbling in here late at night you are probably either a jock, trying to beef up for the season, or just somebody craving a burger that is a step up from McDonalds.
Clover It’s 11:50, and you’re the type that doesn’t want to regret your night too much and is aiming to get up early enough to secure a spot in Lamont. Right before Clover closing, you will find yourself trying to figure out if the $6 sweet potato and bean salad is worth the 6 min wait. Your friends may be pissed that you would not settle for anything else with a couple grams of fat or sugar but hey you gotta keep in mind your beach body goals and satisfy your Type A personality!
Pinocchio's Ok so maybe you didn’t party hard and instead conquered your terrifying CS pset or managed to scrape together your Expos essay (props to y’all that are focused on getting your lives together). Naturally, you are probably looking for a reward and pizza is probably the best reward for anything. If you are really the coolest member of your p-set you will probably end up buying a whole pie to share for celebration.
Insomnia Warm cookies are great…but what does it take to make you crave them until 3AM? A sweet tooth. If you find yourself here you are the kind of person who may say “Oh I am not that hungry, I don’t need a meal, instead lets just get a cookie, actually maybe a cookie sandwich, actually maybe a couple cookies sandwiches.”
CVS If you are the type to prepare for the week during the weekend, you probably will end up in CVS late at night. You probably will buy three packages of Oreos, eat two by the time you get back to your dorm and then wake up in the morning thankful that you bought the third.
