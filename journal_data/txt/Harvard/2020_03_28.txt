After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early March, in Farkas Hall Room 303, Hyperion Shakespeare Company put on their semesterly scene recital. “Exit; Pursued by a Bear” is a series of Shakespeare scenes themed around animals, co-produced by Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20 and Anna M. Schuliger ’20 and featuring snippets from “Two Gentlemen of Verona,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Richard III,” and “Twelfth Night.”
On a whiteboard next to where the audience sat, a stick-figure bear stood on its hind legs and the word “Shakespeare” was drawn next to it in black, then red Expo marker. The Expo marker text drooped as it was written. The outlining was sometimes distant from the letters themselves, or swallowed by some other letter, each one almost alone on a bright abyss.
“Usually we have five or six scenes and they're a little longer, but the process this year was a little different. We ended up bookending [the recital] with two monologues,” co-producer Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20 said.
Before the show, the Shakira “Zootopia” song, “Try Everything,” and “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” played. An actor in a white puffer shirt on a piano bench in the back lip synced, then sashysheyed, swiveling his chest as he went. His head did not bop.
Pyramus and Thisbe and the wall from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” entered in what resembled Halloween costumes, Thisbe’s dress unzipped. The wall, the actor whose head was not bopping earlier, draped himself in a vampire robe. The lion, in a pink turtleneck and jeans, reclined in cat pose on all-fours. Occasionally, the director, Andrew M. Solomons, a student at the Harvard Extension School, intercepted with lines and asked for a repeat.
Thisbe french-kissed the wall’s hand, cupped donut-like. The wall stood still.
“I would practice kissing around. But tonight was the night I decided to actually kiss the guy's hand,” said Caty L. Vigil ’21, who played Thisbe.
“Roar,” the lion (Cecilia R. Trujillo ’21) said.
“I told [the lion] to either be incredibly timid or incredibly confident. She does timid pretty well,” Solomons said. “I told everyone to take themselves as seriously as possible.”
The stage turned black in transition. The actors threw off their costumes, crawled onto the floor, and moved a stool for King Richard to sleep on to center stage in preparation for the scene from “Richard III.”
After the wall from the “Pyramus and Thisbe” scene fed Richard III wine like a dog. Richard III’s head collapsed. Stock horror sounds played. Actor Jeremy Ornstein ’23, in a peasant blouse and curly, frazzled hair, ran from the dark walls blocking out the crew. A strobe-light slideshow displayed Ghost of Clarence, then Ghost of Rivers, then Ghost of Grey, then Ghost of Vaughan. Ornstein caught his breath after the Ghost of Lord Hastings and rose into a screechy falsetto. The falsetto heightened, now the Ghost of Lady Anne.
“Now fills thy sleep with perturbations. To-morrow in the battle think on me!” Ornstein said.
The Ghost of Lady Anne jumped. A pixelated illustration of teepees, then a cartoon from the New Yorker about dogs, revealed itself. About to face his final battle, King Richard hunched over, reading the script.
“I shall despair,” Vigil, portraying Richard III, said.
“Richard III would be in Adams because, first of all, it's a bit castle-like and, second of all, he's quite thinky and has a chip on his shoulder about prestige. He would probably like being in one of those more well-known, older houses,” Vigil said after the show.
Another actor lurched over from under the table, took a sip from the bowl, then finished off the wine, an action Harvard University discourages in the wake of Coronavirus, per university email.
“Oh no, we're not afraid of Coronavirus in the theatre,” Vigil said.
“We're really inclusive and we just want people to be a part of this fun Shakespeare event,” McAuliffe said.
She provided an elbow bump, per what was once University protocol.

Sophie Allison is a tough act to follow. The singer-songwriter, who performs under the name “Soccer Mommy,” garnered critical acclaim for her visceral gut-punch of a debut album, “Clean,” in 2018. On her sophomore album “color theory,” released Feb. 28, Allison doesn’t pull her punches, but she does hesitate before delivering each one. The infectious melodies, intricate production, and biting lyrics that made “Clean” so intoxicating are still present, but with more introspection. Trusting her instincts and turning her critical eye inward, Allison doesn’t fight the sophomore slump. She embraces it.
The slump, in this case, is emotional. Allison’s musicianship is no less deft, but her subject matter is more fraught, creating a captivating dissonance between her ambivalent intonation and aching lyrics. Nowhere is this clearer than on “circle the drain,” the album’s stunning lead single. “I wanna be calm like the soft / Summer rain on your back / Like the fall of your shoulders,” Allison sings in the first verse, masking the seriousness of her subject matter with a country-rock love song beat à la Taylor Swift. But “circle the drain” is deceptive. The melody continues to swell and expand as Allison’s mental health deteriorates. “’Round and around, ’round and around / Circle the drain, I’m going down,” she sings in the chorus. The resigned lyric floats above layered sounds of guitar, percussion, and bubbling water. It’s a master class in calculated angst.
Where “Clean” was seamless, “color theory” is bumpy. The transitions from song to song are often abrupt. The subtle edge of the opening track, “bloodstream,” jumps into the searing whine of “circle the drain” and the blunt, a capella opening of “royal screw up.” The sprawling, seven-minute track “yellow is the color of her eyes” is the album’s solid center. It is a record that, by all accounts, should not work. Gratuitously long songs, no matter the talent or skill of the artist, are rarely done well, but Allison pulls hers off. Grounded by her steady strumming and laissez-faire vocals, the song strikes gold in its outro. “Loving you isn’t enough / You’ll still be deep in the ground when it’s done,” Allison croons as her guitar whines, coalescing with the plucking of a harp and hum of a subtle keyboard. Rather than lying stagnant, the song’s seven minutes pull together the album’s disparate motifs. The anxiety of “crawling in my skin” folds neatly into the song’s orchestral opening while “up the walls” crawls out of its delicate finale. The album’s individual tracks may struggle to find a cohesive sound or style, but each song’s individuality is reconciled by calling back to the themes of “yellow is the color of her eyes.”
Allison is often praised for sounding wise beyond her years. Her high-pitched, sardonic vocals and tendency towards wearing youthful pigtails are tempered by self-aware lyrics and balanced instrumentation. On “color theory,” she lets go of some of this balance. Tracks like “royal screw up” and “stain” are quick and dirty, their sound sparse save for Allison’s vocals and heavy-handed strumming. They’re beautiful on their own, but appear uneven when set against more cohesive tracks like “lucy” or “night swimming.” This is a trade-off for which Allison is unapologetic. In an interview with Pitchfork, Allison said, “I wanted the album to have this incline in energy and then drop into full emptiness.” The album’s sparkling but solemn closer, “gray light,” does just that.
“color theory” does not succeed in spite of its contradictions, but because of them. It is brilliantly oxymoronic, constantly subverting its own lyrical and instrumental inclinations. The album’s sound is layered and distorted, but its lyrics are crystal clear. They are most beautiful when they articulate Allison’s lowest emotional points without sacrificing the tempo, as though the music itself might be a means of pulling herself out. It’s like she sings in “bloodstream”: “Happiness is like a firefly on summer free evenings / Feel it slipping through my fingers / But I can’t catch in my hands.” On “color theory,” Allison can’t quite catch herself. She lets her guard down. She flickers. But she never burns out.

“When I sing, it reminds me of what I’m supposed to do,” singer-songwriter Emily King said to a sold-out crowd during her show at the Somerville Theatre.
King evoked the atmosphere of a quaint living room jam session with her latest show, which supported “Acoustic Tour Pt. II.” King performed a sold-out show Feb. 29 — before the current restrictions were enacted — at the Somerville Theatre. The stage was set simply with two stools and two mics surrounded by the soft, warm glow of bare Edison light bulbs. When King took the stage with her writing, producing, and performing partner Jeremy Most, they brought only two guitars, a handful of beautiful harmonies, and minimal backtracking. The venue and setup provided the perfect backdrop for an intimate, stripped back performance.
The Somerville Theatre, which sits in the center of Cambridge’s Davis Square, features both a full movie theater and a live events venue. The events venue is reminiscent of a traditional theater, with a stage for performers and rows of orchestra seats beneath a balcony section. This smaller venue easily adds to the intimacy of an event. King’s show, however, was fittingly held in the theater, and the night felt like more of a show than a concert. While King sang, the audience was quiet, respecting her musicality. The atmosphere of the night felt similar to a group of friends listening on as one casually, beautifully entertains the rest.
King, who hails from New York, reminisced on her personal relationship with Boston, saying that the city has “a special place in my heart.”
“When I was starting over again because I had been fired from my record label” — here, the audience booed — “I started doing gigs again and Boston was one of the first places I came,” King said. “I took the Megabus. I made $75. I performed at a restaurant and I felt like shit after.”
King explained that the sound wasn’t good, the dressing room was lackluster, and it hurt to be restarting her career. King then explained that after leaving the venue she found four people standing outside with CD’s that had three songs she had been working on at the time. They told her “we heard you on soundcloud and we came to your show!” King explained that she cried realizing that they had come to this random restaurant just for her. She finished the anecdote saying that this “changed her whole [mindset].”
“I just felt like, I can do it again,” King said. The audience cheered after her story and before she began her next song, “Down.” The moment of applause was pitch-perfect, illuminating how far King has come from those few dedicated fans to a sold out show in the same city. Boston was the last stop on King’s tour, and it seemed fitting to end in the place that helped her regain her confidence.
In between her heartfelt speeches and songs, King had the audience in hysterics. She spent many of the interludes laughing and joking back and forth with the crowd. She introduced the song “Look at Me Now” with an anecdote, joking that she was walking down the street when she ran into an old friend. She explained that she had seen all the things they had done over the years, but they didn’t know what she was up to, “So I had to tell them like this,” King said before diving into the song, which describes how she is thriving in her life and career. The song ended with a punch. “The sad part is, they still don’t give a fuck about me!” King said.
Throughout the show, the audience quietly listened to King’s humor and serene vocals as well as Most’s incredible guitar skills and harmonies. King invited the audience to join her in the final song of the night, making the crowd just as much a part of the performance as she and Most. King had the audience sing multiple vocal lines, coming together to create a beautiful synergy unique to a concert this small. Instead of one mass of noise, the audience created a beautiful mix of voices that added to King’s performance. The night ended with a beautifully full version of her song “Sleepwalker,” perfectly exemplifying the care and passion that King has for her music and for her fans.

Nothing nabs the hearts of the American public quite like romance reality TV, and “Love is Blind” on Netflix is the most recent example of this inescapable trend. This “social experiment” challenges several men and women to find a soulmate they are willing to marry before ever seeing the other person, interrogating whether it is possible for an emotional connection to surpass everything from physical attraction to the social pressures of the real world. Social media has run rampant with fans fawning over some couples and relentlessly mocking others, but regardless of the idealistic premise and romantic soundbites, the structure of the show makes it nearly impossible for any couple to actually survive the experience.
At the beginning of the show, married hosts Vanessa and Nick Lachey tell participants that if they fall in love on the show, they will either have their wedding in 37 days or “walk away from that person forever.” This notion is constantly repeated throughout the show — either make a permanent commitment or walk away completely. Thus, the premise does not actually answer the question of whether love is blind. Rather, it just tests whether anyone would be willing to marry a person they have known for 37 days.
First, participants date for ten days in “pods,” during which they speak to one another from separate rooms. If they come out of that experience engaged, they get to meet in person, go to Mexico together, and then supposedly test their relationship in the real world by moving into a temporary apartment. Relationships are expected to move at a breakneck pace and, even though couples can dedicate their full attention to one another each day, these people get less time to commit to a life partner than Harvard students do to commit to a class. Even shows like “The Bachelor” give participants several months to get to know each other. On “Love Is Blind,” couples are constantly reminded of their impending weddings, and every couple, no matter how in love they seem, struggles with such a commitment.
It never seems like a possibility to just postpone the wedding and keep dating to see what happens. So, if your options are absolute commitment in the face of uncertainty or giving up on a partner of a few weeks, the low success rate of the experiment is pretty obvious. To make matters worse, this pressure almost ensures that couples who make it to the end and do not tie the knot are actually forced to part ways forever, since it is hard to imagine making it work with someone who turned you down at the altar in front of your family, friends, and millions of viewers.
This flaw hardly turned out to be fatal for the show — by the release of the last episode, it had become a pop culture sensation. The show delivers a great mix of deliciously romantic and sentimental moments and intense drama, and there are enough couples to make sure viewers are least hooked on one of the storylines. The show is watchable from home, but for anyone actually seeking love via these methods, it seems like a surefire way to end up with a broken heart.

On a cloudy March afternoon, dozens of bright-eyed, newly admitted Harvard Law School students scuttle through the main thoroughfare of the Harvard Law School Library, scanning the spaces where they will study for the next three years. Monumental pillars and regal portraits of presidents and Supreme Court justices look down on them. Slowly, the bustling procession approaches a small room with glass doors at the end of the library. This is the crown jewel of the Law School: the Caspersen Room.
Before 1995, the room was called the Treasure Room, home to the Law School’s prized fineries. The library invites visitors to gawk at the diverse set of objects that fill the room — including rare legal manuscripts, portraits, and even the first Broadway Playbill.
Upon the completion of the room’s construction in 1948, the director of the library said that the room was “not to be a stationary object, but a vital, active force working for the benefit of mankind.” While initially meant to serve as a memorial to the Law School students who fought and died in the World Wars, a walk around the room today reveals Harvard’s connections to long histories of racism and injustice.
The Royall family Crest — three bushels of wheat arranged in a triangle on a bright blue shield — towers above the room. Before 2016, the seal was the symbol of Harvard Law School. In 2016, the Harvard Corporation agreed to allow HLS to remove and replace the seal because the Royalls were a slaveholding family.
Here, in one of the most distinguished rooms on the Law School campus, is one of the only places on Harvard’s campus where the crest can still be found.
Isaac Royall Jr. provided the initial endowment to found Harvard Law School in 1817, using his family’s money generated by the lucrative trade of sugar, rum, and enslaved people in Antigua. The Royall family enslaved the highest number of people in all of mid-18th century Massachusetts; to this day, anyone can visit the slave quarters they built at their home in Medford. Isaac Royall and his father once burned 70 slaves at the stake in response to a quickly muted rebellion.
Daniel R. Coquillette, a professor of American legal history at HLS, was one of the scholars who helped to uncover the law school’s ties to the slave trade. To him, the crest’s exhibition in the Treasure Room is necessary. “We should not sweep history under the carpet,” he says.
Below the painted shield, an exhibit that explores the Royall family’s ties to enslavement explains the process of removing the shield from the Law School’s official crest. Coquillette praised Harvard Law Morgan and Helen Chu Dean John F. Manning ’82 for presenting this information in the room itself. “We cannot revoke the shield because we cannot revoke the past,” Coquillette says.
Portraits of English and American legal scholars line the walls of the room, breaking up the dense collections of books that line the cabinets. These portraits include Charles Hamilton Houston, an HLS alumnus who mentored Thurgood Marshall and has been dubbed “The Man Who Killed Jim Crow.” Perpendicular to the portrait of Hamilton is a painting of fourteen women proudly standing on the steps of the library. These women comprised HLS’s first ever graduating class of women in 1953.
In the corner, a grandfather clock shadows the bust of Finn M.W. Caspersen — the room’s namesake. There are the chairs of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. of the class of 1861, portraits of Justice Joseph Story, class of 1798, and Senator Daniel Webster, and a pencil sketch of HLS Dean N. Roscoe Pound.
The Caspersen Room proudly boasts the desk and lunch box of Pound, the dean of HLS from 1916 to 1936. But, during his tenure as Dean, Pound also spent the decade openly supporting Adolf Hitler. In the midst of Hitler’s rise to power, Pound accepted an honorary degree at the University of Berlin in 1934, signifying his legal approval and backing of the Nazi Party in Germany.
After receiving this honorary degree, Pound and his wife enjoyed a long European summer vacation that included lunches with six of Hitler’s closest aides, including Josef Bühler, Edmund Mezger, and Hans Frank — whose self-proclaimed mission was to “‘rid Poland of lice and Jews.’” Frank and Bühler were both defendents in the Nuremberg Trials of 1946 and were sentenced to death, while the Polish Supreme Court ruled capital punishment for Mezger. Pound once said that Hitler was someone who could bring “freedom” to nearby European nations.
Coquillette acknowledged that Pound’s Nazi connections have not been discussed or acknowledged. He is currently working on Volume 2 of Harvard Law’s Bicentennial History, which will offer an in-depth look at Pound’s collaboration with the Nazis. The report will outline Pound’s support of the Nazi agenda, describe his personal assistant who worked as a Nazi spy, and detail the Nazi party’s plans to use Pound’s power to quell unrest in the United States.
The Treasure Room, however, seems to present Pound as a great leader, scholar, and contributor to HLS. Some of history’s most cherished legal masterpieces surround his memorabilia, and a sign asks visitors to “respect the desk” and not lean on it.
The gaze of the Royall family is unavoidable in the Room — their massive family portrait shadows the exit, elevated and reigning over the room. And for now, the eyes of the family will continue to watch.

Harvard College will adopt a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system this semester as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh announced in respective emails to faculty and students Friday afternoon.
All undergraduates will receive grades of either “Emergency Satisfactory” or “Emergency Unsatisfactory” in their spring classes. Faculty may supplement this terminology with a “qualitative assessment of student learning” in my.harvard.
The decision comes several weeks after University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in a March 10 email that all classes would move online and that Harvard would require students not to return to campus after spring break.
The Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, an FAS standing committee that oversees undergraduate education, made the recommendation for a universal grading system after conducting a review comissioned by Gay. In its survey, the EPC solicited input from directors of undergraduate studies, the Undergraduate Council, and the Honor Council, as well as from graduate, fellowship, and internship programs, according to Gay’s email.
Gay added that the Faculty Council discussed the proposal “at length,” ultimately granting it a “unanimous endorsement.”
“We of course remain committed to academic continuity, but we cannot proceed as if nothing has changed. Everything has changed,” Gay wrote. “This new terminology is purposefully chosen to indicate the unique nature of this semester in the archival record and to distinguish this semester’s grades from Harvard College’s standard grading system.”
Gay wrote that she feels it is “important” to adopt a universal grade policy, rather than an opt-in approach, for reasons beyond “the apparent equity concerns.”
“As colleges and universities have begun to impose similar temporary grading policies for this semester, graduate and fellowship programs have signaled that they will accept these grades if they were instituted for all students. Their flexibility is less certain in any grading system that retains the option for a letter grade,” she wrote.
Last week, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke announced extensions to the deadlines to drop courses and change grading statuses between letter-graded and pass-fail options. Several academic departments also said they would accept pass-fail courses for concentration credit.
In her email to students, Claybaugh emphasized the crucial role student voices played in the decision.
“Our thinking was informed by The Harvard Crimson editorials, by Undergraduate Council proposals, by consultation with the Honor Council, but it was informed just as much by the individual emails sent by so many of you,” she wrote. “We have tried, in this new policy, to address the needs of all of our students, while also responding to the enormity of the situation we find ourselves in.”
Gay conceded that not all students would be pleased with the new system. For the past several weeks, undergraduates have engaged in fierce debates over their preferred grading systems. Some argued they need to raise their grade point averages; others highlighted the unprecedented circumstances in which they will now study.
“Not everyone will agree with this policy, and I have heard reasonable arguments on all sides of the issue. That said, we are facing something that imperils the health of every human on the planet,” she wrote. “I can’t help but be moved by how present our students want to be. But we must in this moment adjust our expectations of them.”
“This grading policy better meets the needs of today, and I hope prepares us to face challenges to come as this situation continues to evolve,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union is alleging that administrators have asked to suspend ongoing contract negotiations while the University reevaluates its financial situation due to the novel coronavirus pandemic — a claim that Harvard denies.
Harvard Graduate Students-Union bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’15 wrote in an email to members Friday morning that the University requested to suspend bargaining for three to four weeks.
“The administration said they need to re-evaluate the University’s finances in the next 3-4 weeks and suspend all bargaining in the meantime,” Yumusak wrote.
“The administration says that when there is more clarity about their finances, they will resume bargaining,” she added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain called the union’s allegation “inaccurate” in an emailed statement Friday. He wrote that Harvard has not suspended bargaining, even as it continues to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 emergency and its impacts on the University.
“It is inaccurate to say that the University has suspended negotiations, and it’s disappointing that HGSU-UAW members are creating this misleading impression,” Swain wrote. “The University, including members of its bargaining team, have and continue to make the safety and wellbeing of every member of the Harvard community the top priority as we work to manage the impacts of this unprecedented public health emergency and meet the academic commitment we have to all of our students.”
Yumusak wrote that the bargaining team believes the University has neglected the needs of student workers amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding they are “truly disappointed” in the move.
“Not only do student workers have urgent needs in the midst of a crisis, but there are several articles on the table that are not about financial needs, such as critical protections against harassment and discrimination,” Yumusak wrote.
The email comes a day after the two parties’ first virtual negotiation session since Harvard closed most operations to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. Yumusak’s email also updated union members about that meeting, during which she wrote they did not reach any new agreements.
The two parties attempted to negotiate a workload provision but did not ultimately come to a consensus, according to the email.
Yumusak also wrote that the union — which launched a “COVID-19 Impact Survey” this month — unsuccessfully pushed for changes to members’ medical benefits during the session, given the coronavirus crisis. Harvard has waived limits on specialist and mental health visits through July 31, but declined to extend the policy past that date on Thursday, according to Yumusak.
“The administration declined to immediately extend this improved health coverage past that date—even though the social and health effects of this pandemic will be felt well beyond this summer,” she wrote. “In addition, the administration once again refused to agree to provide any paid family or medical leave to student workers, characterizing 4 weeks of leave for a student worker’s serious medical condition or to care for a sick family member as too generous.”
Swain further added that the University remains committed to continuing bargaining sessions in the future and engaging in negotiations virtually.
“The University is also working with the mediator and the union to confirm a date for a bargaining session in April, and the two parties are free to exchange proposals through email in the meantime,” Swain wrote.
Yumusak also said the bargaining committee disapproves of the fact that the University has laid off workers, failed to provide adequate safety protections for custodians, and not committed to pay guarantees for undergraduates staffing the Harvard Summer School programs, in transitioning to remote classes.

Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller will step down in June to fill a new post as vice president for student development at Denison University, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced in an email to students Friday.
O’Dair wrote that Miller’s departure is “bittersweet,” and praised his work for the Dean of Students Office, including expanding the College Events Board and Crimson After Dark, as well as creating policies regarding independent student organizations.
“Much of what he achieved cannot be summarized on a resume or in a bullet point,” she wrote. “Throughout the last four years, Alex has left a lasting impression on the many students and colleagues who he has partnered with. I know I am not alone when I say that I will miss Alex’s presence, leadership, energy, innovative approach to challenging situations, and his ability to bring out the best in others. Most of all, I will miss his unwavering commitment to you, our students.”
Miller, who will begin his tenure at Denison on July 1, also currently serves as acting associate dean for inclusion and belonging at Harvard College. He is slated to serve in that role until Alta Mauro takes over on May 1.
Miller wrote he is “beyond excited” to move into his new role, but also acknowledged the transition from Harvard will be difficult for him.
“I am both humbled and honored to take on this exciting role at Denison University and build upon the ongoing and extraordinary work of their Student Development team,” Miller wrote. “At the same time, this is also a difficult transition for me emotionally and professionally. Harvard has been one of the most formative professional experiences of my career, and one I will always cherish.”
Miller joined Harvard College in June 2016 as assistant dean for student life. As associate dean, Miller served as a liaison between student organizations and the College. He and his colleagues helped implement the historic sanctions against single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, which barred members of those groups from serving as captains of varsity athletic teams or holding leadership posts in recognized student groups.
Miller, who worked at the University Of Chicago prior to his appointment at Harvard, also said he is looking forward to returning to the Midwest.
“Returning to the Midwest excites me, but the fondness I have developed for New England will cause me to miss it dearly," he wrote.

Harvard Medical School is developing a plan to give fourth-year students the option to graduate a month early and join the healthcare workforce in anticipation of a major influx of coronavirus patients.
The announcement came in the form of a Friday email to Harvard Medical School affiliates co-signed by Harvard Medical School Dean of Faculty George Q. Daley, Dean for Medical Education Edward M. Hundert, and Dean for Students Fidencio Saldaña.
The announcement follows a Wednesday meeting between Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders and the deans of several medical schools in Massachusetts, including Daley. Sudders urged the deans to graduate their fourth-year students early, with 90-day licenses provided to expedite the process of getting these students “into hospitals as soon as possible to help on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the administrators wrote in the Friday email.
According to the email, administrators held a Zoom meeting Thursday night with graduating students to discuss the option of an expedited graduation and receive their feedback.
“We are working with the University and our accrediting bodies on the details and expect to have more information to share soon,” the administrators wrote.
The trio also noted that the Medical School would not pressure any students to graduate early and join the workforce, though many have already expressed their eagerness to do so.
“They will each have to make a personal decision about whether to graduate early and respond to hospitals in Boston or in other parts of the country where absorbing early graduates as part of the workforce is being built into COVID-19 contingency plans,” the administrators wrote.
In a Friday interview with The Crimson, Daley said healthcare leaders are anticipating a “surge” in COVID-19 patients, placing a strain on the staff at hospitals across the country.
“We're deeply concerned about losing health care workers, technicians, nurses, physicians because of exposure and infection to COVID,” Daley said. “Any strategy that could reinforce the healthcare workforce I thought was very, very, very wise.”
Daley said that, while he saw the “wisdom” of expediting the graduation of medical students, leaders at the Medical School are still trying to explore its implications on students.
Rather than imposing early graduation on all students who have met the requirements, Daley said the process should be “fully voluntary.” Students can “opt in” if they want to graduate early, depending on their individual circumstances.
“Every student has a unique situation,” Daley said. “Some will have more significant concerns for family members, some will have pre-existing conditions or will be in an immunosuppressed state for whom this would add undue risk.”
Daley also mentioned several factors that might impact students’ ability to join the workforce early, including immigration status and outstanding student loans.
“We're trying to be as responsive as possible and give every student who wants it the opportunity, but we also want to be very protective of those students for whom this may represent an undue burden,” Daley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard faculty said they believe the College’s universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system announced Friday afternoon will level the playing field and take pressure off students during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
All undergraduates will receive grades of either “Emergency Satisfactory” or “Emergency Unsatisfactory” in their spring classes, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh announced in respective emails to faculty and students Friday afternoon.
Slavic Languages and Literatures professor Stephanie Sandler wrote in an email that she was “very pleased” to hear of the decision because it takes into account the “disparate circumstances” students find themselves in since the University transitioned all courses online and closed undergraduate dormitories due to the outbreak.
“Removing the pressure of grades for all students seems to me a humane and entirely appropriate response to the shift to remote courses, and a way to help all our students focus on the learning they are able to do this term,” Sandler wrote.
Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 called the change “exactly the right one” because he sees no way to ensure that access to academic resources remotely is as equal as it is with students living on campus.
“One of the things that you can accomplish in a residential college is to a very significant degree level the playing field,” Lewis said.
Some students may live 12 time zones away, in cramped quarters with family members, or in an area without quality internet connection, Lewis added.
Art, Film, and Visual Studies Director of Undergraduate Studies Matthew Saunders ’97 said remote learning “exacerbates a lot of potential unfairness,” particularly for his courses, which involve evaluating students’ physical creations.
“There are ways we can share that over Zoom and I certainly can see a lot in that format, but that’s not the kind of nuance that you would want for, you know, really specific evaluation,” Saunders said. “I didn’t really trust the technology to put me in a position to make confident choices.”
Saunders said students should not be concerned the non-letter grade could derail their applications to graduate programs.
“The arguments that this is detrimental to people’s applications to programs pretend that this is happening just at Harvard, and that this is a vacuum,” Saunders said. “Every graduate program in the country looking at people in the class of 2020, 2021, 2022 is going to be aware of what this moment means in the transcripts.”
Classics department chair Kathleen M. Coleman wrote in an email that she expects graduate programs to be understanding of the circumstances, but faculty members will take the “precaution” of explaining the SEM/UEM grades in letters of recommendation.
“This is a pandemic; it spans the globe,” Coleman wrote. “Everyone looking at a student’s transcript will have lived through it. The reason for the grade will be neither a mystery nor a secret.”
Coleman added she does not believe the shift will affect honors designations for graduating seniors in her department.
The Computer Science department is developing a “thoughtful” way to take the new grading system into account when developing its cutoff for honors, which will include qualitative evaluation in some cases, according to Computer Science area co-chair Edward W. “Eddie” Kohler.
Several professors said they hoped the decision would push grades to the back of students’ minds during an already tumultuous semester.
Applied Physics area chair Eric Mazur said that this semester’s system will be a “very interesting experiment” into how students behave without the motivation of grades.
“I’ve always thought that grades are a very poor incentive to learning because they replace an intrinsic desire to learn with an extrinsic one,” Mazur said. “It’s not conducive to learning.”
Lewis said that Harvard students tend to “greatly overvalue” grades and how they are applied.
“This should be liberating — you should now be able to focus on learning and not worry about the grade,” he said. “I just hope everybody takes a step back and kind of tries to, you know, think about what they were going to school for in the first place.”
“At a time that’s otherwise presenting lots of challenges to lots of families, it should be reassuring and a somewhat positive thing,” Lewis added. “That’s the way I hope students will approach it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several hospitals and research institutes affiliated with Harvard Medical School have increased healthcare and research activities to help fight the novel coronavirus pandemic, despite facing resource shortages.
HMS-affiliated hospitals — like many other hospitals across the nation and the globe — must grapple with treating an increasing number of patients even with dwindling numbers of beds and supplies.
As COVID-19 continues to spread, more than 150 Boston hospital workers have tested positive for coronavirus, and the United States now has more confirmed cases than any other country. In collaboration with Massachusetts government officials and other medical schools in the state, the Medical School is considering allowing its fourth-year medical student to opt into graduating a month early to help bolster the ranks of the healthcare workforce.
Meanwhile, research seeking to understand and address the coronavirus pandemic is flourishing in many Harvard laboratories. Though the University directed all research laboratories affiliated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — with the order extended to Harvard Medical School, Dental School, and School of Public Health — to wind down activities to only essential functions, the University has allowed vital COVID-19 research to continue.
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley said in a Friday interview with The Crimson that local laboratories, institutions, and individual sponsors have stepped up to provide additional personal protective equipment, or PPE, to the school’s affiliated hospitals. A survey this week conducted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found almost 90 percent of more than 200 cities do not have an adequate supply of personal protective equipment.
“We’ve been fielding a tremendous number of very generous offers from alumni and supporters of Harvard Medical School from all over the world really to donate PPE,” Daley said.
Daley said the school gathered the donated equipment in a central storehouse and turned over its management to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.
He also said the hospitals are coordinating the receipt of materials with a central supply network created by the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, dubbed Supply Hub. Using a centralized database to optimize the distribution of PPE, Supply Hub has allowed supplies to more easily reach Western Massachusetts, where protective equipment is scarce.
“Most of our hospitals have been very effective at being able to maintain supply chains and coordinate the receipt of a lot of this material,” Daley said.
Despite these efforts, many Medical School-affiliated institutions themselves continue to face medical equipment shortages. Cambridge Health Alliance — a Harvard-affiliated public healthcare system — reported a shortage of supplies on its website, where it is seeking PPE donations from the public.
“Like all hospitals during this outbreak of COVID-19, Cambridge Health Alliance is facing a shortage of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment,” its website reads.
At the same time, Cambridge Health Alliance has also had to grapple with the conservation of its existing supply of PPE, spokesperson David Cecere wrote in an email.
“We are pursuing different avenues to bolster and conserve our supplies so that we can meet the critical need and support our frontline staff,” Cecere wrote.
Harvard-affiliated Boston Children’s Hospital is also facing an equipment shortage, though Chief of the Division of Medical Critical Care Michael S.D. Agus said the hospital’s supply is not “critically low” at the moment.
“We’ve already invoked our reuse protocols, which are CDC-approved and carefully designed protocols to minimize the use of PPE to begin with, only to the circumstances where it’s truly needed, and then to have decontamination procedures so that masks and our protection can be cleaned and reused by the same practitioner,” Agus said.
Because health experts expect sick children to require ventilators in lower numbers, Agus said the equipment in the hospital “may be even available for use by adult populations.”
Michael J. Mina, the associate medical director in clinical microbiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital — another Medical School-affiliated hospital — said supplies of nylon flocked swabs, which are used for testing, are “becoming completely nonexistent.”
“We’re going through multiple channels just to get in touch with manufacturing plants in China,” Mina said. “They’re actually producing a lot of swabs for us.”
Meanwhile, several Medical School-affiliated hospitals have bolstered their coronavirus-related functions and changed certain policies in response to the pandemic.
Massachusetts General Hospital — the Medical School’s largest teaching hospital — has activated its Hospital Incident Command System, which delegates responsibilities in emergency situations.
In addition, MGH announced that it would not allow visitors during the pandemic, “with very limited exceptions” as well as virtual visiting options.
Cambridge Health Alliance wrote on its website that it will provide doctor’s appointments by phone and video.
Additionally, CHA recently launched a drive-through service for coronavirus testing at its Somerville hospital. Due to a limited number of testing kits available, the tests are only being offered to current CHA patients experiencing coronavirus symptoms for the time being — but according to Cecere, CHA hopes to expand the service to the public in the future.
“The service aims to maximize access to tests while minimizing potential exposure of the virus to our patients and staff,” Cecere wrote in an email.
Judge Baker Children’s Center — a Medical School affiliate that specializes in children’s mental health — has closed its Manville School for children with special education needs and moved classes online, according to Christopher Bellonci, Chief Medical Officer at Judge Baker Children’s Center.
“We mobilized quickly to ensure that all the students that we work with had a functional computer that they could access,” he said. “We were set up already to be able to shift to remote teaching.”
“Many of our students and families also struggle financially and so we’ve been providing food to some of those families in need, just as many of the public schools are doing, and our clinicians are reaching out trying to support the families in helping our young children,” he added.
So far, the number of pediatric COVID-19 cases remains lower than adult cases — placing Boston Children’s Hospital in a different position than most other medical centers. Agus said the hospital may experience an influx of patients as other medical centers try to make space for adult COVID-19 cases.
“We are preparing for the possibility that institutions that care for adults and children will be forced on a temporary basis to allocate their pediatric resources to the care of adults,” Agus said. “We are standing ready to care for those kids.”
Beyond patient care, Agus also said the leadership at Boston Children’s is focused on the protection and management of illness amongst its healthcare workers.
“The number of people that are out is extraordinary,” Agus said. “There's never been this much fear of getting a life-threatening illness through any random interaction with either patients or colleagues.”
Many researchers across Harvard’s Longwood medical campus are working on coronavirus-related projects across a wide range of disciplines, including refining diagnostics, developing vaccinations, and predicting public health concerns.
Perhaps most notably, that work includes a long-term collaborative research effort between Harvard-affiliated researchers and collaborators in China, funded by Fortune Global 500 company China Evergrande Group to the tune of $115 million.
At the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering — a Harvard cross-disciplinary research institute — administrators announced they would be “ramping down” most research operations as a part of University protocols.
But coronavirus research at the institute has continued at full throttle. Wyss Institute spokesperson Benjamin Boettner wrote in an email that though researchers are seeking to address the pandemic through a variety of methods, research largely remains in “early or intermediate stages.”
“It will probably take a while before they will be in doctors’ hands,” he wrote.
Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald Ingber said in a press release that the Wyss Institute has been able to “refocus” its efforts to help address the coronavirus, even as other research ceased.
“With our highly multi-disciplinary and translation-focused organization, we were able to quickly pivot, and refocus our unique engineering capabilities on much needed diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine solutions, and we hope to be part of the solution for many of the innumerable problems the present pandemic poses,” Ingber said.
Correction: March 28, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the material of testing swabs running low in Harvard-affiliated hospitals. They are nylon flocked, not cotton.
