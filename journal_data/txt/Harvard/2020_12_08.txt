After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beloved “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek passed away recently after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Here’s to you, Alex.
Trebek’s legacy is hard to quantify. He truly impacted many lives during his time on screen, even more behind the scenes. With a nod to Johnny Gilbert and a patient ear for each contestant, Trebek was more than just a host to those he met — he was an idol.
Although his fame was most widely attributed to the game show “Jeopardy!,” Trebek was active beyond the scope of 7:30 p.m on NBC. He was a philanthropist who championed many educational causes in his home country, Canada, especially supporting his alma mater the University of Ottawa. Trebek traveled far and wide for his charitable work with World Vision, an organization that he and his wife Jean supported. He also received the honorary Order of Canada appointment for his lifetime achievements. Trebek reflected on his heralded love for giving back in his book “The Answer Is…: Reflections on My Life,” which was published earlier this year. True to his own spirit, Trebek donated all of the book’s proceeds to charity.
It’s clear that Trebek himself lived beyond the shadow of “Jeopardy!”’s legacy. He was, however, principally responsible for cultivating that legacy in the first place.
Since the debut of the show’s modern iteration in 1984, “Jeopardy!” has consistently proven itself to be America’s favorite quiz show. Its broad-ranging trivia style had people of all ages and backgrounds tuning in to try their hand at a category or two. People soon began rooting for their favorites to win week after week, sparking a dramatic intrigue that is rare for game shows. That popular demand paved the road for the game’s long term success, eventually earning it a spot in the Broadcasting Hall of Fame.
Although a riveting question-and-answer contest may be what initially captivated viewers, there is no doubt that Trebek was what kept them coming back.
From a young age, Trebek had a true knack for hosting, booking broadcasting roles and radio gigs alike. After landing “Jeopardy!,” young Trebek — still bright-eyed and bushy-tailed — put those skills to good use. His charisma and energetic personality kept the pace lively and the nerves wracking, meshing well with the action-hungry audience tuning in during the ‘80s. As time went on and “Jeopardy!” cemented itself in the spotlight, Trebek developed a more collected and informed presentation style that provided a perfect balance to the competitive and variable edge of the game. Always known to have a positive attitude and an engaging presence, it is no surprise that Trebek claimed the title of Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host seven times.
Perhaps Trebek’s character is most accurately summed up in the words of some who knew him best.
“Alex wasn’t just the best ever at what he did,” “Jeopardy!” GOAT Tournament champion Ken Jennings reflected on Twitter, “he was also a lovely and deeply decent man.”
“Alex Trebek entertained and educated millions around the world,” Canadian Prime Minister and Trebek’s countryman Justin Trudeau wrote.
“Alex Trebek was a legend of American television who will never be forgotten or truly replaced,” legendary “Jeopardy!” contestant James Holzhauer concluded.
Not only was Trebek celebrated for his kind personality, he was also revered for the lasting impact he left on so many lives. “I grew up, I learned English because of you," Albert Thakur, a contestant from November’s tournament, tearfully admitted during his time on the show. Led by a man whom the entire country has grown to love and cherish, an appearance on “Jeopardy!” truly became an American Dream for so many.
So when a future answer reads “The greatest game show host of all time,” the world can confidently respond, “Who was Alex Trebek?”

Attention, Upper East Siders: The hit 2000’s show “Gossip Girl” is coming back as an HBO Max reboot! Although delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, HBO officers and screenwriter Joshua Safran have confirmed the arrival of 1o new episodes in 2021. Fans and critics alike have been paying close attention to updates, which have included limited casting picks, plot details, and costume reveals.
The sharpest disappointment is obvious: The original cast will not return. Instead, the reboot will pull a “Glee” Season 4 and introduce a whole new host of characters within the same universe as the originals. The only returning cast member will be Kristen Bell, presumably as the iconic voice of Gossip Girl, which clearly could not be replaced. The series will be led by Emily Alyn Lind, playing Audrey, who "has been in a long term relationship and is beginning to wonder what more could be out there.”
Other leads include Canadian star Jordan Singer, “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”’s Whitney Peak, and “Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists” star Eli Brown. The cast itself is far more diverse than the original show (low bar), and aims to focus on relevant social issues. This will likely pose a challenge. The original show is rife with soap-opera drama, and besides a few drug busts and Bart-Bass-attempted-murders, it steered clear of addressing social issues. Probably for good reason, too: It’s difficult to balance dramatic teen drama with serious conversations about identity and politics without diluting and misrepresenting one or the other.
The “Gossip Girl” reboot’s biggest challenge will be avoiding a “Heathers”-like failure. In attempting to update the cult classic “Heathers” by marrying social commentary with exaggerated teen-drama, the 2018 project flopped. Its timing was abysmal, and the series never really satisfied either of its intended purposes. The “Gossip Girl” reboot will need to be mindful of this as it proceeds, especially when its directors and writers have emphasized the importance of social media in the new series.
There is potential in the “Gossip Girl” reboot, though. Look towards HBO Max’s “Euphoria,” which managed to wrap together a myriad of relevant social commentary with juicy teen drama. The show, despite its initial shock factor, received decent reviews from both casual fans and critics. Although far more successful than other attempts, “Euphoria” still toed the line between glamourization and truth. “Gossip Girl” will have to do the same thing, as the fictionalized world of the Upper East Side is synonymous with luxe and glamour, even without Serena van der Woodsen. With its goal to depict the changed landscape of New York City on top of the new social-media-driven world, the reboot has quite the challenge ahead.
Amid all the cautionary tales and uncertainty, the “Gossip Girl” reboot can look forward to one thing: the return of Eric Daman. The original show’s costume designer is responsible for Blair Waldorf’s iconic headband collection and Serena van der Woodsen’s trendy (although sometimes questionable) 2000’s fashion. Despite none of the original characters taking leading roles in the reboot, Daman’s return highlights the show’s main draw as a nostalgic escape into the world of Manhattan’s elite. The writers ensure long-time fans will stay connected with the series by creating new stories within the original universe. The reboot’s characters will still don Constance Billard’s signature uniforms while lunching on the steps of the Met, as pictured in the latest pictures of the set. Furthermore, original characters will be mentioned in the reboot, suggesting a Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-like continuation of the timeline full of Easter eggs. These intricacies will keep “Gossip Girl” devotees coming back, but ensures a new generation also explores the woes and peril of the Upper East Side.
There are many pitfalls and traps that the “Gossip Girl” reboot could fall into. Trying to meld together social commentary and teen drama while preserving the original voice of the show is a tricky line to toe. However, the new series also brings the promise of 2000’s nostalgia and revisited fan favorites. The cast and director understand the task ahead, and are trying to limit rumors and fan theories. There is certainly dedication, and the efforts to expand the original show’s limitations are valiant. One thing’s for sure– fans cannot wait to see if the reboot can bring the drama of an iconic Thanksgiving episode.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 13, Harry Styles made history as the first solo man to ever grace the cover of American Vogue. He did so in a periwinkle ball gown designed by Gucci. In other images from the cover shoot, he wore pieces from long-time collaborator Harris Reed, a designer known for his genderfluidity and andogynous designs anchored in glam rock and Victorian influences.
Also on Nov. 13, conservative author and commentator Candace Owens unleashed a tirade of social media posts berating Styles for his dress-wearing and the rest of society for allowing such an “outright attack” on “manly men.” She later followed up her original tweet — taking a break from tweeting conspiracies about the COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and about the Black Lives Matter movement (which she falsely claims is a “domestic terrorist cell”)— by reinforcing that, yes, she did mean “bring back manly men,” adding in the claim that “terms like ‘toxic masculinity’ were created by toxic females.”
The idea of “manly men” that Owens is talking about, however, is a retrograde conception of masculinity rooted in a false sense of nostalgia for a society that never was — one in which masculinity was predicated on a skewed conception of John Wayne-esque machismo, and in which women were outwardly barred from taking up as much space as they do now. As many of Styles’s defenders were quick to point out, men have been wearing fashion we currently see as “feminine” for centuries.
As MSNBC wrote in their coverage of the incident, “Did she forget about Jesus?”
Indeed, from the elaborately decorated high heels worn by aristocratic European men throughout the 16th and 17th centuries (and, prior to that, by Persian soldiers in the 15th century) to the sparkly outfits worn by musicians like David Bowie or Freddie Mercury that dominated arena stages for decades, the conception of what fashions can and should be worn by men has always been at least somewhat fluid.
The fragile form of masculinity that is scared to wear a dress is the same one that refuses to care enough about other people to wear a mask during a pandemic for fear of being emasculated. And it is the same misconception of masculinity that Donald Trump took advantage of in order to create the sense that his administration would bring back a chauvinist America whose “greatness” is questionable at least.
In fact, the tradition of masculinity aggrandized by Owens is the type of hypermasculinity that exists as a direct backlash against feminism and the freedoms it has granted women — freedoms which include Candace Owens’s right to be a public figure rather than a doting housewife confined to the four walls of the family kitchen and, of course, her right to wear a suit, as she did in an Instagram post from Nov. 2019. The post is now flooded with over 40,000 comments from people either quoting Styles’s lyrics in an attempt to clog her feed or using Owens’s own superficial conceptions of gender against her.
“Bring back feminine women!!!” reads one of the comments. “Delete this picture!” reads another. “A woman shouldn’t be wearing a suit!”
Elsewhere on her Instagram, fans have flooded Owens’s tagged photos section with pictures of the “Adore You” singer from the Vogue shoot and his countless other ventures into more genderfluid fashion.
As comedian Kathy Griffin tweeted, “Candy Owens doesn't know what she in for going up against the Harry Styles stans."
“When you try to drag Harry Styles but he looks amazing...anyways, #TPWK Candace Owens” wrote one such stan in the Twitter tirade that followed Owens’ post, employing Styles’s signature “Treat People With Kindness” slogan in their tweet. That tweet was just one of the hundreds of thousands written by Styles fans in support of the singer and his fashion choices.
Celebrities, too, were quick to jump to the singer’s defense. Everyone from Olivia Wilde — who is currently directing Styles in his sophomore acting role in her upcoming film “Don’t Worry Darling” — to actor Elijah Wood spoke out against Owens’ comments.
Attacks in the name of preserving “masculinity,” like the one launched by Owens, however, are nothing new. As actor Zach Braff said in his defense of Styles, “our whole life men and boys are told to be manly. Life is short. Be whatever the fuck you want to be.”
Add in Owens’s forced connection between what she sees as “the steady feminization of our men” and the rise of “Marxism,” and the whole incident follows a deeply established pattern in the U.S.’s history of fearmongering and discrimination. For decades, the American right has perceived any moves towards the breaking down of a gender binary as somehow both queer and anti-manliness. It has also long conflated this perceived proximity to queerness with a leftist communist takeover. At the same time as the Red Scare and McCarthyism were taking over the nation’s consciousness in the 1950s, for example, there was also the “Lavender Scare.” While the former was a massive political scheme targeting communists that was rooted in an intense fear of anti-capitalist ideology, the latter targeted members of the LGBTQ+ community by dismissing them from government en masse. Both populations were seen as subversive in the beliefs they represented, and were therefore shut out just as Owens attempted to shut out Styles.
Of course, gender fluidity in fashion did not start or end with the pop singer. Artists have explored fluidity in their dress for decades, and it would be remiss to ignore the massive strides made by the LGBTQ+ community that allowed for Styles to wear a ball gown and skirt in a Vogue photoshoot.
While Owens continues to tweet about men in dresses and the subsequent downfall of society, Styles has yet to publicly respond, and it would be no surprise if he never does. He looked incredible in the Vogue shoot, anyway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Strange times call for strange art, and artist Benjamin R. Zank is quite familiar with the strange. A journalism major turned surreal photographer, Zank has built an extensive body of work around beautiful portraits that are lighthearted, unusual, and haunting all at once. Zank’s images, which often depict oddly-contorted human bodies in both urban and natural environments, grapple with such themes as loneliness and isolation — themes that resonate particularly strongly in the middle of a global pandemic. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Zank to discuss his connection with photography, the surreal nature of his work, and the effects of a pandemic on his creative process.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve mentioned your story for getting into photography before — discovering your grandmother’s Pentax ME Super at age 18. As you’ve journeyed through film and digital in your transition from hobby to career, what have you learned about photography as a medium? What makes it special?
Benjamin R. Zank: You’re taking what’s there and sort of molding it into something entirely different, whether that’s going to be surreal, whether it’s going to be a portrait — I think that’s really cool. You’re capturing a moment that isn’t going to happen again as well.
THC: Your work has been described as surreal by many, including yourself. What drew and continues to draw you to surrealism?
BRZ: I guess it just came out of becoming bored with other types of photography. When I first got into taking pictures, I did anything from landscapes to portraits. And then in college, I pursued a 365 project, which was taking a photograph everyday for a year, and during that project I discovered a lot of other young photographers who were doing 365 as well. They were not only just taking self portraits of themselves, but they were pushing the boundaries of what an image was in terms of photo editing and whatnot. I found that to be very interesting.
I was also majoring in journalism at the time, and like I said, photojournalism is the complete opposite of art in the sense that it’s very objective, so that bored me at the time. Being able to do something that was subjective — making an image appear exactly how you wanted it — was very intriguing to me. I guess over the years, the more bizarre the image is, the more fun it became for me to create.
THC: You’ve mentioned that you don’t try to convey a specific message with your images, but your work is guided by your emotions. What’s your typical creative process? Is it usually fixed, or do you go about crafting images differently every time?
BRZ: I would say that my creative process remains generally the same, with the exception of — if I do come up with a solid idea, I will take steps to prepare for that loosely. I used to try to map out exactly what I was going to do and I found that particularly the way I work is that whenever I try to overplan for a photograph, it never comes out the way I want it to. I’m always disappointed with it, and I’ve found that it’s more beneficial for me to be spontaneous. I find myself doing something that I wouldn’t have expected and that ends up making the image more unique. That’s pretty much how I do almost all my photographs these days. I don’t really overthink it. If I take an image and I find that there’s something there, I may reshoot it with a more solid concept. But mostly I just go out and find a location, and if the location’s really unique, I’ll work with that and then go from there.
THC: Is your creative process ever influenced by current events, or is it more of an individual endeavor?
BRZ: It’s incredibly influenced by the events — emotionally, psychologically. Unfortunately, most of my friends have moved out of New York, so it’s been very lonely here in New York lately, and I would say that’s kind of hurt my creativity. New York doesn’t feel the same as it did. I’ve lived here all my life. I didn’t move here, I was born in New York. I grew up in the Bronx, I live in Brooklyn now, and… it’s the last straw here for me, and I think I’m probably going to relocate. I know that I can’t solve all of my problems by moving somewhere else, but what I can do is I can definitely put myself in a position where I’ll feel more motivated to go out and create. I feel like right now — the state I’m in — I’ve sort of done everything there is to do here in New York — creatively, that is, in terms of location because I don’t have a studio. I always shoot on location, and I feel like the landscape here is just not suitable to what I want to do anymore.
When the pandemic first started, I did do a humorous parody photo when it didn’t seem that serious at the time, but outside of that I think there’s so much art and media surrounding current events that I think it’s a breath of fresh air to get out of that and escape reality. I think people like to escape reality most of the time because there’s already enough content addressing the current issues.
THC: Isolation seems to be a theme that surfaces again and again in your images. Do you view your work any differently as the world struggles through a pandemic that has imposed isolation on many?
BRZ: I think I don’t really view any of the old work versus the stuff I’ve made now any differently. I think it still blends together quite well and I’m happy about that… The funny thing is that the concept of isolation, or the appearance of isolation, in my images usually stems from the fact that it’s a lone figure, but in reality I couldn’t feel less alone when I’m photographing things, when I’m shooting with myself. When I’m out there creating I feel quite fulfilled[,] actually. It’s kind of funny.
THC: How has COVID-19 impacted the way you showcase your work? Since typical art exhibitions aren’t particularly feasible at the moment, have you been more focused on your website or your social media presence?

BRZ: Well, my social media presence has always been a large and important factor in the way I share my work and the way I’ve gotten jobs and whatnot. Unfortunately, I think the pandemic has affected physical exhibition prospects that I had lined up, but outside of that not much has really changed. In fact, I think with everyone at home and on the internet more, it makes sharing work online even easier. I mean, it’s great but it also kind of sucks because it’s nice to go outside and meet people and talk about art with people. There’s always a silver lining; there’s a negative and a positive to it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Happy (belated) birthday, Leo! In honor of Hollywood’s favorite Scorpio turning 46 on Nov. 11, here’s a ranking of his top five movie roles.
5. “Inception” (2010)
“Inception,” directed by Christopher Nolan, is lauded for mind-bending special effects and an intricately woven plot that challenges audiences’ perceptions of time and consciousness. Holding these elements together is the protagonist Dom Cobb, brought fully to life by Leonardo DiCaprio. Cobb, a thief with the power to infiltrate dreams, is tasked with planting an idea into someone’s mind in exchange for his being able to return to the United States where his children live. DiCaprio reveals the cracks in Cobb’s usually stoic facade with great care, portraying this complicated character as ultimately very sympathetic.
4. “Titanic” (1997)
This list would be remiss to leave out James Cameron’s “Titanic,” the blockbuster that made everyone fall in love with DiCaprio in the first place. He stars as Jack Dawson, a steerage passenger aboard the ill-fated Titanic who falls in love with the affluent Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). DiCaprio was a ’90s heartthrob, but that isn’t the only reason his character is so adored; he brings Jack's boyish optimism to life with a certain irresistible charm. Granted, the relationship between Jack and Rose is a bit melodramatic in the countless obstacles that keep them apart. (Is the scene where Jack is handcuffed to a pole while the ship is sinking really necessary?) Nevertheless, it’s still an evocative love story, the kind that stays with you and leaves you wondering, even 23 years later, why Rose couldn’t share that door with Jack.
3. “The Revenant” (2015)
The biopic “The Revenant” might not be as rewatchable as “Titanic,” but it does deserve recognition as the role that finally earned DiCaprio his first Oscar. He stars as frontiersman Hugh Glass, who struggles to stay alive after a grizzly bear attacks him. It’s a story of both physical and mental endurance, as Glass simultaneously grapples with life-threatening injuries and grieves the loss of his son. DiCaprio famously went to great lengths to authenticate this role, from eating raw bison liver to sleeping in animal carcasses to wading in frozen rivers. “The Revenant” might be difficult to watch at times, but DiCaprio’s performance reflects the amount of painstaking effort he put into it — the Oscar is well deserved.
2. “The Departed” (2006)
In Martin Scorsese’s gritty crime drama “The Departed,” Leo co-stars as Billy Costigan, a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the Irish mob in Boston. At the same time, Matt Damon’s character Colin Sullivan joins the police force as a mole for the mob. Although there’s strong acting all around, from Jack Nicholson as the sadistic mob boss to Alec Baldwin as the police captain to the divisive rat in the final scene, DiCaprio’s performance truly stands out. He convincingly grows more and more desperate as Billy, who feels he’s losing his true identity as he’s caught between two worlds.
1. “Romeo + Juliet” (1996)
Baz Luhrmann’s modernized adaptation of “Romeo + Juliet” might be controversial, but there is a distinctive originality to it that makes it compelling. Leo stars as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet, star-crossed teenagers who come from rival gangs in the fictional Verona Beach, where Shakespearean dialogue contrasts with a modern setting. Luhrmann’s creative direction particularly stands out in the film’s iconic love-at-first-sight scene. Romeo and Juliet notice each other while standing on opposite sides of a fish tank, gazing at each other through coral and clownfish as Des’ree sings her ballad “I’m Kissing You” in the background. This scene could easily have been overdone, but it ultimately works really well, made especially effective by the chemistry between Danes and DiCaprio.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and undeniable influence on the world. Part of this influence will be some very bad art — after all, taking advantage of horrific tragedy for personal literary gain is a noble, longstanding tradition. The Corona-novel — an emerging and extremely bad genre certain to haunt literary houses for years to come — is the only logical next step. Even now, it is beginning. Across the country, in socially distanced MFA programs and coffee shops alike, aspiring novelists are getting ready to write.
I have taken a fun little trip into the future (followed by, of course, a fourteen-day quarantine and disruption of the space-time continuum) to assemble this list of excerpts from Corona-novels to come. They may not be enjoyable, literary, or even realistic. But they are, unfortunately, inevitable. Here’s a short sample of the bad literary tropes the future holds in store.
Kissing Through a Mask
I consider the half-hidden face before me. I can nearly make out the lips draped under the cold blue fabric. Without thinking, I lean in, and so does she. And we kiss like that: cloth against cloth, mask against mask. We pull back and exhale, taking a long, shuddering breath. For a moment, the world faded away. It was just us: her, me, our masks, and our lack of knowledge about the germ theory of disease.
Trashy Barnes and Noble Romance Novels Á La “Trapped With Him” 
At first, Natalia hated the banker. His grating voice, his constant phone calls, his slightly-too-tight suits. But after the past week of mandatory quarantine, she started to notice other things: his tousled bedhead in the mornings, the way his eyes twinkled when he laughed, his frantic typing as he checked the skyrocketing rates of disease on Huffington Post.
“This Was All Just Fine Until It Started Affecting ME”
Before, the virus was scary. But when it affected aunt Jeanine’s ex-wife’s dog... it became all too real.
Elderly Couple Forced to Quarantine Together Remembers Why They Fell in Love
“It’s been a while since we spent time together like this. I… I missed this.”
He grabs her hand.
“I missed us.”
Young Couple Forced to Quarantine Together Immediately Breaks Up (Feat. Screaming, Misplaced References to “Marriage Story”) 
“You and your stupid nail biting! It’s all I can hear, all I can think about!”
“At least,” she spat, “I’m not constantly talking about my rock collection.”
Jerome fought back tears. “Eloise, you know my dead brother gave me those rocks.”
There was a long, terrible pause. “Maybe you should just go.”
“I wish I freaking could,” Eloise said, gritting her teeth, “but epidemiologically speaking — you know I can’t leave.”
Stock Anti-Masker Characters
“I think masks are bad,” said the antagonist angrily.
“You are mistaken,” said the love interest knowingly. “Masks are, in fact, good.”
Using Loss of Taste or Smell as a Dramatic Corona-Reveal
“This curry sucks! I can’t taste a thing,” said Bradwick, rolling his eyes.
We exchanged a horrified glance across the table.
“But Bradwick,” said Elizabeth, “it’s extremely spicy.”
The table went silent. We looked at him: his pale countenance, the bead of sweat on his forehead. Then suddenly, the silence was broken: a single dry cough rang through the air.
Quarantine Ennui (Quarantennui, If You Will)
Every day, he woke up in the same comfortable, rent-controlled apartment. He stared at the same wall. He watched the same clock. The days began to blur into each other. He downloaded Animal Crossing. He went to bed. He woke up. He deleted Animal Crossing. He went to bed. He waited.
Self-Quarantine Turns Into “The Yellow Wallpaper” 
“There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.
Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.
It is always the same shape, a sphere with club-shaped glycoprotein projections, only very numerous.
And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder — I begin to think — I wish I could be done with my mandatory period of quarantine!”
Last Minute Confessions
Before we get sent home because of COVID-19, does anyone want to admit they have a crush on me? Contact ezra.lebovitz@thecrimson.com with any inquiries. Watch out: I am not a catch.
Zoom as Metaphor
I knew we were miles apart, an insoluble barrier. But sometimes, when our cursors were in the same place — it was almost like we were touching.
Dystopias Abound
Day 39. I talked to Scrgeorge* last night, although he is not a member of my Pod. I do not believe I was seen, but I just had to see his face, warped by disease and radiation as it may be. I can only pray I was not tracked by the secret police; known by the underground as “Friends of the Pod” for their rigid and brutal enforcement of social pods after the Great Disease. Scrgeorge says the people have grown restless. It is only a matter of time before a reckoning.
Zoom as Tragedy
“Oh. Oh, fuck.”
“What is it?”
“Diana, I didn’t send that to you. I sent it in — in the public Zoom chat.”
*Editor’s Note: The name “Scrgeorge” was taken from this online fantasy name generator’s results for "George Bush."*

Warning: This article contains major spoilers for the latest season of “Grey’s Anatomy.”
If you’re like much of Gen Z, then you’ve binge-watched all 16 seasons of “Grey’s Anatomy” on Netflix. You’ve traveled through the ever-changing social dynamics of Seattle Grace/Seattle Grace Mercy West/Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. You’ve watched the majority of the original characters either die or leave the show. You’ve watched the evolution of Meredith Grey — and the 11-season-long evolution of Meredith’s relationship with Derek Shepherd. And quite recently, you tuned into the Season 17 two-episode premiere, only to experience some powerful emotions of shock, nostalgia, and confusion, even by Grey’s Anatomy standards. Out of nowhere, Derek Shepherd is back.
It is unclear to what extent Derek is back, but there are some clues. The premiere was unique even prior to the momentous reveal — the episodes are set in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The doctors are struggling with new safety protocols, a shortage of masks and PPE, and their usual complicated social lives. Meredith is in charge of the frontline workers, and as her patients die, her exhaustion and frustration mount throughout the two episodes. In typical “Grey’s Anatomy” fashion, the major moment occurs at the very end and leaves us with a major cliffhanger. Meredith mysteriously passes out in the parking lot, and suddenly, she is on a beach. Like a mirage, Meredith hears Derek, who died six seasons ago, calling out to her. Meredith finally sees him and, overwhelmed with emotion, calls out to him in return. Fans know that these emotions have grown over the last six seasons — their relationship was an integral part of the show, and Derek’s death was unexpected and heartbreaking.
After being hit with the emotions of this absolutely epic moment, fans wondered: What does this mean for Derek’s future on the show? The “Grey’s Anatomy” IMDb indicated that Patrick Dempsey will at least be in the next episode. But what does Meredith seeing Derek mean? Meredith has had near-death experiences where she interacted with past dead characters in prior episodes, but she always managed to stay alive. Fingers crossed for a full Meredith and Derek scene in the next episode, but I think it’s obvious that just hearing Meredith and Derek say each other’s names again was exciting enough.

Nothing seems to happen in some films. In others, everything occurs at once. Taiwanese auteur Edward Yang’s mesmerizing drama “Yi Yi” (2000) deftly bridges this dichotomy, detailing the monotony of adulthood while also illuminating the complex emotional upheavals that strain even the closest of familial bonds.
Situated in Taipei, Yang’s film follows the lives of the intergenerational, working-class Jian family through the perspectives of three individuals: a disillusioned engineer and father NJ (Wu Nien-jen), his reserved adolescent daughter Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee), and his uncannily perceptive eight-year-old son Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), who uses his camera as a means of making sense of the world. By braiding together these three narratives, Yang communicates the unique challenges of each stage of life while emphasizing shared themes of change, loss, and longing.
“Yi Yi” opens with the marriage of NJ’s brother-in-law A-Di (Chen Hsi-Sheng) and a pregnant Xiao-Yan (Hsiao Shu-shen). Their wedding, though supposedly an occasion for celebration, is anything but — the bride and groom are expressionless, perhaps even bored, and the attendees’ uncomfortable silence is punctuated by a baby’s distressed cries. The unnerving juxtaposition between the wedding’s exterior pomp and its bleak atmosphere exemplifies a core tension in the film: that between performative calmness and interior turbulence; between neat lies and complicated, repressed truths. Though Yang’s characters are profoundly unhappy and confused, they refuse to admit this to both themselves and to others.
The film also succeeds as a subtle study on the distressing vapidity of life. Between dramatic sequences, Yang inserts uneventful, panoramic shots of ordinary scenes — a busy crosswalk, a diner, and a wedge of skyline – all steeped in saturated hues of red, cerulean, and green. These memorable shots of kinetic cityscapes and lively arguments are at once breathtaking and unsettling. Their slow pace suggests an agitating stagnance, one that steadily grates on Yang’s characters as the film progresses.
The visceral discomfort evoked by the film’s meticulous cinematography is accentuated by the emotional frustration of Yang’s characters. Shortly after A-Di and Xiao-Yan’s wedding, the mother (Yang Ru-Yan) of NJ’s wife Min-Min (Elaine Jin) has a stroke that leaves her comatose. The cramped bedroom where she subsists on life support becomes the backdrop for some of the film’s most raw, unnerving moments of emotional vulnerability.
In a particularly memorable scene, Min-Min sits at the edge of the bed, detailing her daily routine to her mother in hopes of coaxing her to consciousness. Abruptly, she begins to weep, expressing her confused remorse over the repetitiveness of her daily activities: “I have so little,” she laments between violent sobs, “How can it be so little? I live in a blank! Every day … every day … I’m like a fool! What am I doing every day?” Her despair over the possibility of her mother’s imminent death is shadowed by a subtler existential anxiety about the insignificance of her own life.
Toward the end of the film, an exhausted Ting-Ting walks into her grandmother’s bedroom to find her awake. She rests her head on her grandmother’s lap, closing her eyes. “Why is the world,” Ting-Ting begins, “so different from what we thought it was? Now that you’re awake and see it again — has it changed at all?” The camera transitions abruptly to Ting-Ting dozing alone, suggesting that her fleeting exchange with her grandmother was a dream. This supposition is confirmed by the doctors crowding the bedroom: Her grandmother is dead.
It is deeply symbolic that Yang chooses to open with a wedding and end with a funeral. During the latter, Yang-Yang speaks to his late grandmother. His small figure, clothed in starched black, vividly contrasts the heaps of white flowers resting on draped tables below a photograph of his grandmother.
“Do you know what I want to do,” he asks, “when I grow up? I want to tell people things they don’t know, show them stuff they haven’t seen — it’ll be so much fun. Perhaps one day, I’ll find out whether you’ve gone.” The purity of Yang-Yang’s undeterred aspirations — his shining, carefree vision for the future — throws the disillusionment and melancholy of the adult world into sharp relief.
It remains unclear whether Yang-Yang will preserve the audacity of his dreams or resign himself, like those before him, to the bleak tedium of a life filled with obligations and regrets. This thematic ambiguity is precisely Yang’s intent: Rather than confer to viewers a simplified binary of optimism and despair, he provides glimpses of newness and hope within the largely grim fabric of the family’s intergenerational story, ones that intimate the potential for change. It is for the audience to decide for themselves what complex sentiment lingers behind Yang-Yang’s knowing gaze as the screen cuts to black.

In his sensitive comedy-drama “Chungking Express” (1994), director Wong Kar-wai uses stunning visuals, layered dialogue, and a unique narrative structure to challenge the boundaries of time and the imagination. It is undeniable that Wong’s film is breathtaking; some may even argue that it borders on the creation of its own cinematic genre. However, despite its revolutionary vision, Wong's excessive abstraction often renders his film aimless and ungrounded.
“Chungking Express” is structured around two consecutive stories which both follow post-breakup cops’ encounters with mysterious strangers. Though thought-provoking, this unique narrative structure often does more to obscure than to illuminate. The first story focuses on a cop named He Zhiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who, devastated following a break-up, seeks new love and meets a mysterious woman in a blonde wig (Brigitte Lin) at a bar. The second story, which follows a cop referred to simply by his badge number 663 (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung), details his enigmatic relationship with a restaurant worker named Faye (Faye Wong). Moments of retrospective, first-person narration provide the film with a confessional intimacy.
By focusing on two stories, both of Wong's narratives end up feeling underdeveloped. In the first story, it quickly becomes clear that the mysterious blonde woman is involved in drug trafficking, a lifestyle Wong accentuates with thrilling chase scenes drenched in hyper-saturated shades of red, cyan, and dark green. Though these moments of cinematography are stunning, they often serve more to elevate the film aesthetically than to clarify its fundamental plot. At the end of the first story, the characters remain frustratingly unknown. The transition bridging the first and second story is disjointed and abrupt, connected only by a single shared interaction at the titular snack bar named Chungking Express.
In the second half of the film, the confused abstraction of Wong’s cinematography is partially redeemed by consistent themes of solitude and human longing. The song “California Dreamin,’” for instance, serves as a musical through-line in the chaotic film. The symbolism of the song is two-fold. For one, California, a place radically different from Hong Kong, underscores the characters’ desire for escape and reinvention. Secondly, the latter half of the song’s title reflects the film’s tendency to occasionally take on a surreal quality, blurring the line between the real and the imagined until they merge into one.
The use of ordinary objects as narrative tools also acts as a cohesive motif in Wong’s film. In the first story, He buys canned pineapples following his breakup as a homage to his ex-girlfriend May, who loved the fruit. He reflects, “When did everything start having an expiration date? Swordfish expires. Meat sauce expires. Even plastic wrap expires. I’m starting to wonder: Is there anything in this world that doesn’t?” He’s obsession with expiration dates underscores his own fear of abandonment. In the second story, Cop 663’s idiosyncratic tendency to speak to inanimate objects in his house as if they were people — a towel, a stuffed animal, a shrinking bar of soap — emphasize his loneliness following the departure of his lover.
Though evocative and poetic, “Chungking Express” at times seems like an amalgam of partially executed ideas that are further developed in Wong’s future projects. The narrative duality of “Chungking Express” reflects that of “Fallen Angels” (1995), which revolves around two largely disconnected stories. The trope of romantic intimacy between strangers, exemplified by He’s infatuation with the woman in a blonde wig, is further explored in Wong’s magnum opus “In the Mood for Love” (2000).
Wong’s dreamlike film is weird and gorgeous. It is by no means, however, a fully realized idea. Nor is it the consummate film on the agony of loving and of letting go, of the blurred space between loneliness and romance. For that, skip six years into the future to Wong’s “In the Mood for Love.”
“Chungking Express” is being screened virtually as a 4k restoration by Film at Lincoln Center.

“Rebecca," a gothic romantic thriller directed by Ben Wheatley, certainly has big shoes to fill — its source material, a 1938 novel of the same name, was a massive bestseller. Eventually, it inspired a film adaptation by Alfred Hitchcock that went on to win Best Picture at the 1941 Oscars. This new adaptation is stunning, stressful, and messy: It delivers beautiful cinematography and psychological thrills, but fails to address the more interesting aspects of the source material.
While serving as a lady’s maid at a French coastal resort in the early 20th century, the film's nameless heroine (Lily James) meets the rich Maxim de Winter (Armie Hammer), a widower whose wife, the titular Rebecca, recently died under mysterious circumstances. Maxim and our heroine embark on a whirlwind cross-class romance, which leads to their eventual marriage. However, things turn south when the de Winters move to Maxim’s Manderly estate, which is overseen by Mrs. Danvers, a foreboding housekeeper with an almost obsessive loyalty to Rebecca. The new Mrs. de Winter is haunted by the legacy of Rebecca, whose power over the household lingers posthumously.
One area where the film succeeds is its aesthetics. The opening act of the film, with its warm gem-toned color palette and sunny lighting, screams nostalgia and romance. The costumes are especially brilliant, with vibrant shades of pinks, reds and yellows. This wistful visual language is contrasted by brief glimpses of something sinister floating just beneath the surface. Back in her room after her ventures with Maxim, the heroine is cloaked in darkness, the warmth of the previous scenes completely absent. By switching the visual tone, Wheatley builds tension and hints at a lurking darkness just around the corner. When the heroine moves to Manderly, this sinister tone takes over the film, leaving it cold, suffocating, and sterile. The once warm palette is replaced with hollow hues of blues, grays, and blacks. The only shade that remains from the first act is red, which takes on a new severe and unnerving tone as seen in Mrs. Danvers' lipstick and the dress worn by the heroine’s hallucinations of Rebecca.
The performances in “Rebecca,” however, are a mixed bag. Lily James’ Mrs. de Winter and Kristin Scott Thomas’ Mrs. Danvers are both engaging, especially in scenes where they play off of each other. There is a tension between them that borders on sexual, as Danvers attempts to seduce the new Mrs. de Winter into a state of madness, and when the two occupy the screen at the same time, it's impossible to turn away. However, both actresses have a tendency to deliver their lines in a melodramatic fashion that can distract from the film’s stakes. In contrast, Armie Hammer’s Maxim — and his half-hearted British accent — is completely forgettable. Hammer seems to be attempting a Bronte-esque performance, however, he ends up coming off as more off-putting and boring than brooding and intriguing.
Hammer’s performance reveals a greater issue with the film — that it fails to meaningfully explore why the new Mrs. de Winter is so committed to her boring husband. There are moments in the film that seem to be suggesting something interesting about men and the power they hold over women, but Wheatley never fleshes out these themes. There are clearly power differences between Mr and Mrs. de Winter which the film starts to address but never really takes a stance on. The main character only derives her sense of self from her relationship with Maxim and his dead wife, so much so that she doesn’t even have a name. In the final scene of the film, which does not appear in the book, the new Mrs. de Winter explains why she stood by Maxim, quipping about the power of love. This extra scene feels like a massive cop-out and is emblematic of larger narrative issues: Wheatley doesn’t have the courage to delve into the complicated power dynamics between the characters and often chooses instead to explain away the more complex elements of the story — which leads to a sloppy, convoluted conclusion.
“Rebecca” is a visually beautiful film, but it doesn’t say or do anything new. The film is often suspenseful and exciting, but with its uneven performances and failure to address the key tensions between its characters, “Rebecca” ultimately feels like an unnecessary update to a classic.

America’s latest page of history is a curious one. The penmanship is incoherent and the visuals are abstract. Our national narrative is a mess of reality, brutality, and wide-eyed fantasy. From this hurricane of national uncertainty, "Boys State" was born. Known for their unconventional, often wildly thought-provoking undertakings including “Moonlight” (2016), “Mid90s” (2018), “Midsommar” (2019), and “Uncut Gems” (2019), A24 proves that the best is yet to come.
It is Texas in the dead heat of June, and the annual Boys State summer program has begun in its characteristic pomp and circumstance. With a quintessentially American fanfare playing in the background, a brief description of Boys State scrolls across the screen: “Since 1935, the American Legion has sponsored a program for teenagers to learn about democracy and civil discourse through a week-long experiment in self-governance.” Sepia-tinted photographs of alumni like Bill Clinton, Samuel Alito, and Dick Cheney float across the viewer’s sightline.
Boys State is a democratic experiment — think Model United Nations or Junior State of America on steroids. The documentary film closely follows four participants: charismatic Southern Westpoint-hopeful Robert MacDougall, political junky Ben Feinstein, Chicago native René Otero, and underdog Steven Garza. Each of these characters presents distinct tropes of current political affairs in the United States. Campers, randomly divided into the Nationalist and Federalist parties, campaign for various positions — the most prestigious one being the Governorship.
Despite being in the racial and political minority, Garza, now a freshman at University of Texas at Austin, manages to secure the gubernatorial candidacy for the Nationalist party in an upset against MacDougall. Feinstein and Otero win their respective parties’ State Party Chair elections. Though Garza and the Nationalist Party ultimately lose in a tight race against the Federalist party, the film illuminates Garza’s ability to unite people and approach those with radically different political beliefs with humility, dignity, and compassion — suggesting the possibility of a new political normal.
In a recent “Boys State” College Conference Call hosted by A24 Studios, Garza, Feinstein, and MacDougall, along with directors Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine, spoke on their process making the film.
Moss and McBaine commented on their inclusion of minority voices in the film. "[Texas is] still a big majority of conservative and white groups, and so we were very excited to follow Steven through this process because he was a little bit of an underdog, you know, in a lot of ways,” McBaine said.
Both commented on their initial reservations about Garza’s capacity to lead, as well as their pleasant surprise when he eventually did. “He really inspired people to their sort of better selves and I love that about what we experienced when we watched it, and what it just reminds me that this country is capable of if people are given a chance and their voices heard,” McBaine said.
The subjects of the film, also present at the conference call, pitched in their two cents on the restrictions and structural challenges of the American political system.
“I don’t think that your values and your ability to win an election are actually mutually exclusive,” Feinstein said. “I would much rather vote for someone who I disagree with who I think is honest, respectable, will make a call based on evidence, than someone who says what I want to hear but I don’t trust to have those morals.”
MacDougall mentioned how refreshing it was to witness real progress and political compromise be made at Boys State. “That’s something you don’t see in actual big-world politics,” the Texan native said. “I hope we’re able to see more of that — actual difference-making, actual conversations, actual moving forward on important things."
Garza called attention to the danger of beleaguering the superficiality of labels and the importance of leveraging the underlying humanity of all constituents when engaging in political processes: “I wish that more politicians around the country would actually sit down with the opposition,” Garza said, “not the enemy, the opposition.”
Brandon Barzola, a reporter at the University of Connecticut’s The Daily Campus expressed his appreciation of the conference call.
“I found the documentary to be really impressive and impactful,” Barzola said, “So hearing stories about both the filmmaking process and Texas Boys State from the filmmakers and subjects alike was really interesting.”
Kate Button, a reporter at the University of Utah’s The Daily Utah Chronicle, voiced similar sentiments. “While the film on its own was an incredible feat of vérité filmmaking and offered unique insights into our current political climate,” Button said, “I was fascinated to hear how the directors, Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine, approached the filming and editing process.”
“The film beautifully captured the chaos and competition of the Boys State program,” Button continued, “The in-depth focus on these few subjects highlighted the necessity of seeing people for their humanity rather than their party identity.”
What democratic traditions will the leaders of tomorrow choose to reinforce, and what political wings will they begin growing today? In our new normal, it is difficult to say. However, “Boys State” dares viewers to believe that some things might just change. As the conference call concluded and students began to log off the Zoom session, the subjects’ and filmmakers’ voices still rang in the air, passionate, profound, and very much hopeful.

Not many can claim to have been born six years old. Calvin, of “Calvin and Hobbes,” proves the exception to that rule. Bill Watterson drew the first of the now-iconic comics in November of 1985, and the last in 1995. Now, 35 years later, Calvin is no older, and “Calvin and Hobbes” remains the complex, philosophical examination of childhood it has always been. The eponymous Calvin and Hobbes, named respectively for John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes, occupy their time with sledding, torturing their babysitter Rosalyn, and engaging in the wild bouts of imagination which define the comic.
Less a running gag and more a part of the underlying structure of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the question of Hobbes’s realness. One frame Calvin is clutching a tiny tiger plush, and the next he’s on the shoulders of a standing tiger twice his height. Every few comics they are busy transmogrifying each other into pterodactyls and aliens. Watterson paints it all in an exquisite reality, depicting the world exactly as Calvin imagines it. Occasionally, especially in the classroom, his reality is a cynical one. But there are just as many instances of wonder.
One of Watterson’s favoured tricks is to depict Calvin and Hobbes in the midst of a deeply philosophical conversation, ruminating on how to best find meaning in their lives, and have the last frame “cut away” to reveal them spending their precious time watching television. But that is not always the case. One of the most distinctive parts of the comic is its portrayal of the great outdoors. “Calvin and Hobbes” was inspired by the suburban world of the American Midwest, specifically the forests of Ohio, and it is that Midwestern forest where Calvin and Hobbes seem to find conclusions in their grand search for the meaning of life. One of the most touchingly wondrous comics, the last Watterson ever drew, shows the first snow day of the New Year. Hopping onto his sled, Calvin declares, “It’s a magical world, Hobbes, ol’ buddy… Let’s go exploring!” And off they whizz into the endless white.
Equally terrifying as the impending loss of childhood is the decline of the natural world. In that sense “Calvin and Hobbes” is a manifesto on climate change. Hobbes lists all the reasons for fear: “Our oceans are filled with garbage, we’ve created a hole in the ozone that’s frying the planet, nuclear waste is piling up without any safe way to get rid of it…” Where does it leave us in our search for meaning, asks Watterson, if we have no more nature to find it in?
“Calvin and Hobbes” remains an icon for the very thing which brought it to fame –– its willingness to accept the impossible, to embrace the irrationality of the moment. Other things are less central but still essential –– Calvin’s perpetually exhausted parents, his emphatic boredom in the tiresome classroom, his relentless imagination, his deep philosophical ponderings when set free with Hobbes to roam the forest in his iconic red wagon.
One famous full-page frame includes a still image of a little yellow path, weaving through a meadow surrounded by forest. There are three iterations of Calvin and Hobbes zooming along in their wagon. In the first and leftmost, Hobbes says, “Well, summer is almost over. It sure went quick, didn’t it?” Calvin responds with characteristic unconcern: “Yep.” A moment of silence is a hard thing to achieve in one comic frame –– here, Watterson executes it with remarkable simplicity. The little wagon flies through the center of the strip, elevated as always slightly above the ground. The last image of Calvin and Hobbes is a tiny one, just a blurred shock of yellow hair and the rainbow’s-arc of Hobbes’s tail as they crest a hill. In the moment before they disappear down the other side, Calvin remarks, “There’s never enough time to do all the nothing you want.”
It is a melancholy thought. Even for someone eternally six years old, the idea of growing up is a difficult one to come to terms with. In the midst of immense global uncertainty, “Calvin and Hobbes” remains terrifying –– and strangely reassuring.

McKinsey & Company is in the news, again. The consulting company — at times dubbed “McHarvard” for its reliance on our graduates — has found itself at the center of a controversy over its role in the ongoing opioid epidemic. The story is as depressing as one might expect, featuring top executives seeking to increase revenue in a Machiavellian, almost too-dark-to-be-true fashion, including by discussing the possibility of offering rebates to distributors for Oxycontin overdoses attributable to their sales, helping Purdue turn a profit despite the deaths.
That much isn't surprising, not at this point. The consulting firm's penchant for unethical practices has been broadly publicized. This isn't even the first time McKinsey’s collaboration with Purdue Pharma has come under scrutiny: last year, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 highlighted the firm's role in opioid marketing, including its efforts to “counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed” on Oxycontin. McKinsey has also faced (and denied) other accusations of unethical conduct across nations and continents. Some are mundane and even meme-inspiring, like the alleged price-fixing efforts of bread in Canada; others, like the firm's ties to American immigration authorities and its efforts to cut spending on food and medical care for immigrants, prove more concerning. If that wasn’t enough, reporting by the New York Times has accused the firm of helping "raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe," through its work with Saudi Arabian, Chinese, and Turkish governments, among others.
But again, those controversies should hardly shock us as they embody the basic, understated ethos of the firm: ensuring increased profits for its clients, whoever they might be, at almost any cost. It fits a decades-long pattern that has, through cuts to middle management in the name of efficiency and the promotion of hyper-glorified managing consultants, helped gut the American middle class.
Yet every year a very sizable portion of our student body chooses to work for McKinsey or similar firms. More than one in 10 Harvard graduates of the class of 2020 chose a career in consulting straight out of college, a number that rises to more than one in five among those who entered the workforce in their first year after graduation. More of our graduates chose to work for firms like McKinsey than to work in the academic, government, non-profit, education, and art sectors combined. Individuals selected for their academic curiosity and leadership spend eight terms in a vibrant intellectual community and come out of it with a passion for the high-income lifestyle that McKinsey and other consulting firms guarantee. If McKinsey has developed a feverish devotion to wealth accumulation, so have a significant portion of our graduates.
It’s worth wondering what this says about our institution and ourselves. The trend is partially the result of McKinsey's aggressive hiring policy, featuring numerous initiatives across the academic calendar. But attributing our choices to external influences, acting as if our peers are poached into entering the consulting field, is both naive and shortsighted. Look no further than the Harvard College Consulting Group, an entirely student-run organization, for proof that we really don't need outside partners to devote our time to the most lucrative yet morally ambiguous endeavors.
The question, then, is why we actually go through with it, why scores of graduates relinquish the passions that brought them here for a paycheck and a reptilian nickname. A campus filled with overachievers is bound to seek easy indicators of prestige, and money and its comfort can be tempting — even HCCG advertises events ranging “from concerts, to food-tasting, to go-karting” and more.
But why do we find money so validating in the first place?
We have a campus culture that instills a very specific set of normative values. We tell our students what we value — money, power, influence. Get enough of it, and you'll be invited to parade around the yard even if you're a convicted sex offender, or name a school even if you aid anti-democratic efforts. You'll even get your kids into the College, even when others with comparable qualifications would be rejected. Our courses teach the importance of curiosity, persistence, and intellectual promise. The halls where they take place and the elitist clubs that dominate our social life instill a very different story. Harvard remains an icon of an economic elite, not just an academic one — no matter the college’s efforts to the contrary.
The past few months I've worked on columns zooming into billionaires from different corners of the world and I've found myself wondering if perhaps I wasn't being realistic; if imposing a high moral standard on the way our university funds itself was counterproductive or banal as long as our institutional influence remained a net positive. I’ve wondered whether any of it mattered; whether it was such a big deal to have scholarships named after prominent Donald J. Trump donors and museums that help whitewash the opioid epidemic.
But it does matter.
I believe that our world is deeply broken, but that it doesn't have to be. That it can be better, fairer, brighter. But how can we challenge a broken system on which we entirely depend, one that we represent, embody, and strengthen? How can we advocate for deep, radical, positive change when we spend so much time currying the favor of precisely the individuals who engineer so much grief; when our students are increasingly and depressingly focused on the career fields that will allow them to do so themselves? How can we expect 22-year-olds, anxious for the same validation that brought them to our doors, to choose anything but the well-trodden paths of wealth that Harvard itself treasures so dearly?
I don't know. But I'm not sure there's a point to a transformative education devoid of transformative ambitions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States President Donald J. Trump’s rise within the Republican Party has forced conservatives across the country to decide whether to embrace him, condemn him, or stay silent. This is no less true for right-wing students on Harvard’s campus. The Harvard Republican Club, for example, chose not to endorse Trump in 2016 — calling him a “threat to the survival of the Republic” — yet reversed that decision to endorse the president’s reelection campaign earlier this year.
The number of self-identified conservative students on campus has dwindled since Trump received the Republican nomination four years ago, and far fewer Harvard students supported Trump in the presidential election than supported Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012. Many of the remaining Harvard conservatives have expressed frustration at what they believe to be the increasingly hostile environment on campus for Republicans, despite the fact that nearly a third of Americans identify as such.
We sympathize with those who feel uncomfortable expressing their views and part of their identity on campus. And it’s worth noting that conservative students are by no means the only ideological group that faces marginalization. That experience is shared by many students who are leftists, religious minorities, or otherwise occupy a space outside the prevailing ideological norm.
And yet we want to caution against drawing an equivalence between being a conservative and being a member of a historically marginalized group. That underrepresentation is not comparable and speaking of it as if it is — or in the same breath — is misleading and manipulative.
Moreover, conservative students do not, by virtue of their ideologies, deserve the same protections or support those minorities need. Their political beliefs are perfectly reasonable grounds for the judgment of their peers.
To be sure, we continue to believe in the freedom to voice any opinion. But that also entails a reciprocal freedom to react, dissent, and protest those opinions in as strong a manner as feels fit. And the crucial process of engaging with those we strongly disagree will inevitably be messy and leave people feeling hurt. We cannot deny those emotions on either side. Politics is personal; pretending it’s not is silly, at best.
It is critical that everyone, regardless of background or ideology, challenge their own beliefs and have their value systems challenged by others — by friends, classmates, academic advisors, and professors. Not only is this engagement a central component of the liberal arts experience Harvard offers, but it also helps transform us all into more thoughtful individuals with battle-tested beliefs that we can defend to ourselves and in public spheres beyond this campus.
Professors and other discussion facilitators should not assert their own bias in a way that discourages contributions from students with political views counter to the majority; our classrooms should not be echo chambers. Professors should welcome a breadth of opinions into a discussion and challenge their students to think critically about all of them.
But as we have opined before, the views a student expresses in the classroom are not and should not be immune from judgment. Political views have real-life consequences, and classrooms or academic forums are not hermetically sealed zones of no-consequence intellectualism. Our classrooms are part of a broader world, and the conversations we have in them bear on that world and the lives we carry into them from outside. There is no pure space of ideas, no space where we can just toss around ideas without regard for their implications.
As always, the best way forward in the face of political divisiveness is to seek out the humanity in others through open-minded, good-faith discourse. Finding that way forward is hard work — fraught with emotion, frustration, and discord — but it begins with acknowledging that what we’re doing is always more than argument and bears deeply on our lives and the world we are constantly making.
