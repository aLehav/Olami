SEOUL, South Korea — The months leading up to South Korea’s college-entrance exam, the College Scholastic Ability Test, are some of the most stressful in a South Korean teenager’s life. Far more than the SAT or ACT, the CSAT holds bearing on people’s well-being  20 years after they take it. If students score highly enough to get into a “SKY” university—a Seoul National University, Korea University or Yonsei University—they land on the path towards an enviable job, salary, and social class. 
The heavy consequences of CSAT scores drive the Korean high school education system into a frenzy—one those creepy parents on CollegeConfidential.com can’t even touch. High school students almost all attend “cram school” classes, where they’re taught material expressly for the CSAT. Even more serious parents send their children to boarding cram schools, where they study for the test from 7a.m. until midnight, and are banned from watching videos, the Internet, and having boyfriends/girlfriends.
The CSAT holds a singularly sacred place in Korean culture. On the day of the national exam, many businesses and the stock market open late in order to keep the roads clear for students driving to their testing locations. Airplanes are prohibited from landing or taking off from Korean airports during the listening section. Korea’s temples and churches are filled with praying parents.
And yet, despite its excesses, the CSAT is compellingly meritocratic. Rich students and poor students alike get to compete for the same lucrative prize and are judged by the same measure. The best example of this is the South Korean president, Lee Myung-Bak. Lee grew up as the penniless son of an agricultural laborer but he aced the CSAT, got into Korea University, and was vaulted into a sphere of job opportunities completely beyond the reach of his father. Sure, wealthy students have access to more personal tutoring and highly rated cram schools, but with hard academic work, every Korean has the chance to earn a higher place in society.
In a highly stratified culture, this promise is a powerful one. When I ask my Korean friends what they think of students who go to Seoul National or Yonsei, their first reaction is, “They must work really hard.” In contrast, when a Harvard student drops the H-bomb, often the first reaction is, “Wow, you must be really smart.” Since Korean college admission is based entirely on a test score, it is widely acknowledged that no matter how naturally intelligent you are, if you don’t study intensively for the exam, you won’t go to a top-tier university. Grades don't even matter: I know one Korean girl who got sick of her high school’s competitive atmosphere, dropped out, and studied on her own for the CSAT. She scored highly enough to go to Ewha University (the top-rated women’s college in Korea, and part of SKY’s emerging acronym rival, SKYPE, which adds Pusan and Ewha Universities to the older triad).
The dark side of this unequivocal faith in hard work is that people who don’t succeed academically take this failure very personally. In America it’s comforting and often valid to write off disappointing admissions results as bad luck or unfortunate circumstances. Korean students blame themselves. It is common for those who don’t get the score they want on the CSAT to take a year off to study and then re-take the exam. If they fail again, it’s even more heartbreaking.
Yet, harsh as it sounds, the equalizing nature of the entrance exam—which reflects  the value Korean society places on hard work—makes the CSAT well worth the stress and heartbreak it visits on thousands of students each year. Sure, the thought of having your college admission and social cache based on a day of testing is terrifying for everyone already in the upper echelons of society. But, for those at the bottom, it’s a uniquely Korean opportunity that’s missing in so many other countries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LONDON, England — “Britain has been hit worst by the recession,” asserted my father at the dining table. Forks fell from mouths and fists emphatically banged on the table as the rest of my family rushed to violently agree.  My brother vigorously traced the entire world crisis back to Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s actions, while my mother gazed fretfully around the table and expressed her concern for “you kids.” Each family member offered a doomsday prediction that aimed to top the last, and collectively denied the International Monetary Fund’s statement that Britain is the best placed to counter the crisis.
Last week, while skies were tauntingly grey, my work colleagues ignored their sheltered office confines and persistently grumbled about the awful lack of summer. We collectively awarded Britain the title of worst climate in Europe, and this topic of conversation was deemed important enough to invade every exchange. Nevertheless, this week, when the heat wave finally struck, each sweat-stained commuter on the underground wore a pained expression while newspaper headlines lamented—never celebrated—the oppressive weather. Train passengers thought wistfully back to cooler days, and whined that their English bodies were not suited to such weather.
Britain is a notoriously negative nation. We were convinced we wouldn’t be granted the opportunity to host the Olympics in 2011, and when we were, we moaned about the cost. In contrast to the chipper optimism in the U.S., pessimism runs rampant throughout Britain. 
For some reason, I find it a strangely refreshing attitude, and take great comfort in the shared grumbles of my compatriots. Recently, during a company presentation at work, I realized the reason for my seemingly illogical preference for complaints.
The Chairman of News International, James Murdoch, summarized recent newspaper figures in a speech for a company. Due to the current state of the industry, Mr Murdoch was naturally bound to deliver a depressing series facts. “There’s a lot of positive news too,” he encouraged, “but we’re going to focus on the negative, in order to improve.”
With this same rationale, I will continue to favor critical evaluations over positive ones, because to be consistently positive is to accept flaws as inevitable. The British may be a little extreme, but our constant disapproval means we never miss an opportunity to progress.

SANTIAGO, Chile – The woman who sits next to me waltzes into the office at about 12:30 p.m. everyday, carrying a bright orange cup of Vendomatic coffee from the machine downstairs. She checks her e-mail, raves about her life to whoever might be listening, then generally leaves work after about 2 hours in the office. Last week she stepped out early to go swimming. 
Supposedly I work at the best newspaper in Chile.  El Mercurio is the oldest continuously printed publication in the country, and its paper-of-record. Santiago’s two other newspapers are the aptly named El Segundo (The Second) and La Tercera (The Third).
Someone here must be working hard. But in the month that I’ve spent interning in the section “Artes y Letras,” my office seems more like a high school than a respected newspaper.  
My computer directly faces the Vida Social (Social Life) section. Each week, this collection of eight or so people puts out a page of pictures and caption-length blurbs about the social goings-on in Santiago. Even with my Photoshop deficiency, I estimate that I could put this section together by myself in about 5 hours. 
Instead of toiling over articles, they spend most of their time admiring each other’s manicures, looking at pictures on Facebook, pretending to be models, eating, and practicing the Chilean national sport (gossiping). I am not sure why they have a secretary, but I have seen her practicing her dance moves in front of the mirror in the bathroom on multiple occasions. 
Earlier this week, someone blew a trumpet from the second floor of the newsroom.
“I thought this was a newspaper,” said the poetry reporter who sits on my other side, “not a stadium.”

SANTIAGO, Chile – “Waiting at bus stops alone at night on the street may be seen as inviting problems.” 
As I squinted to get a glimpse of my watch in the dim streetlight, these cautionary words from a Harvard-produced guide to Chile briefly crossed my mind.
Indeed, I was companionless at one such deserted bus stop. And finally the watch’s slender hands came in to focus. 4:39 AM. That would probably qualify as night. Textbook case of time-to-hop-in-a-cab-itis.  
Yet I had just sunk over $20 on a (lame) club’s cover and a single drink (and God knows what in future dry-cleaning/medical expenses from the ubiquitous cigarette smoke/deafening reggaetón beats). Public transportation suddenly sounded delightful. 
The hasty driver bumpily steered me to my silent neighborhood, an eclectic collection of gated stucco and wood-clad residences separated by impressive, seemingly impenetrable walls. Passing these fortresses, some crowned with electric fences or barbed wire, noobs would probably fear being mugged by knife brandishers or kidnapped by a roving band of gypsies. 
A three-week veteran of Santiago living, I did not share that fear.
I intrepidly moseyed down my street, eager to greet my lonely bed. In the distance, I spotted a pack of wild dogs across the road. Yet again, this would petrify a rookie of Chile. But I’ve witnessed neighborhood strays togged up in tartan vests (though these nude mutts obviously were not aware that plaid is back). Homeless dogs here don’t badger you. They don’t really move, even. Excessive motion does pill cashmere, after all.
Then they started barking. 
I walked faster. The barks got louder. I walked faster. The barks got closer. I turned around. 
Shit.
Three canines launched themselves towards me at full speed, jaws unlocked (ready to sink into some gringo flesh, I surmised). Instantly, I morphed into a sprinter, shredding layers of leather off of my driving mocs as I drowned my lungs in icy air.
“Help me!” I shrieked incessantly between breaths. Realizing I was in Chile, not Chicago, I quickly translated those screams to the Spanish “¡Ayúdame!” 
The dogs counteracted with more barks.
Still hightailing it, waiting for a sharp bite into my thigh, I heard the growls gradually grow more distant. The dogs had stopped. I had left their territory (in addition to waking up the entire neighborhood, including my host parents, who offered to scatter poisoned bananas around to protect me).
Yesterday, I saw a dead puppy laying on the side of the road, its mother standing over it, crying to the passing cars. I recognized her. She had chased me that night.
My fingers toyed with the three rocks in my pocket I now carry, ready, if need be.

NEW YORK, N.Y. — Last Saturday morning at 5:30a.m., two Vassar friends, Crimson writer Jun Li '10, and I headed to Central Park. We decided to wait for free tickets to the Public Theater's latest Shakespeare in the Park production at the Delacorte—Twelfth Night with Raúl Esparza, Anne Hathaway, Audra McDonald, and Julie White. It's a thing to do in New York City during the summer on a limited budget. The culturally-aware, unpaid intern gets in line. A very, very long line.  
5:30 a.m.: My first alarm goes off. Then the second and the third. I wake up and so does Jun. We brush teeth, hair, and map out our route to the Central Park entrance near 81st Street. 
5:47 a.m.: That cooler we filled with five bottles of water, two bags of cherries, Boursin, non-gluten salsa, chive-and-onion cream cheese, and a zillion ice cubes? Felt like a great idea when we packed it back home. Now It just feels like I'm dragging all of Brüno’s wardrobe down Fifth Avenue.
5:50 a.m.: "It's definitely this way," I say. We drag beach chairs and Food Emporium bags toward 81st. A guy selling old photos of New York in plastic covers shakes his head. He points farther downtown. "That entrance's better," he says. 
6:00 a.m.: On one Park pathway, a guy walks up behind us. "Are you going to the theater?" he asks. "Yeah," we all say. He takes big steps, leaves us in the dust. O, what men dare do! He makes a left turn. "Shhh," I say as we bear right.  
6:07: a.m.: We reach the Delacorte, and no one's in line. What luck! "Good Morning," I say to a NYPD officer. "Line starts on Central Park West," he says. He's so not going to let us cut.  
6:12 a.m.: Near the theater, we watch a parade of people walk by, dragging air mattresses and blankets and cardboard boxes and yoga mats. Definitely the slept-on-the-street-overnight crowd. We stare.  
6:13 a.m.:  People walk, we stare. 
6:15 a.m.: Still staring.  
6:22 a.m.: Staring.
6:23 a.m.: We decide to look for the end of the crowd and walk toward Central Park West. "Hey, Harvard," someone yells, "back of the line." (Jun's wearing a Harvard sweatshirt).  O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
7:15 a.m.:  A Public Theater representative yells: "That's the end, right there." No chance for tickets, now. A crowd of people—including us—shrug shoulders and kick the dirt. Most pack up, disperse. Jun spots a friend and I encourage her to wrangle his extra ticket. Hey, it's a tough world and the lone wolf survives. No luck.  
7:18 a.m.: The troop is in low spirits. We decide to salve the wound of this failed mission with breakfast. We set up camp in the sun. Bagels and cream cheese all around. What's done is done. 
7:22 a.m.: Jun and I read embarrassing books (I've got Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, she's got New Moon). One Vassar friend listens to music, another flips through Marie Claire.  We learn that New York City ranks 16th out of 20 on the magazine's "Top Cities for Single Gals on the Prowl." Seattle's number one. Good to know. 
7:32 a.m.: In the moments since we’ve left the line, it’s grown into the “Stand-by Line.” The desperate pray for cancellations while waiting for last-minute tickets. We give it a shot. "What are you waiting for?" Three older men in too-short running shorts, tank tops, and sweatbands approach. We explain about Shakespeare in the Park, about people sleeping overnight on Central Park West. "Oh," says one man. "the neighborhood's going to the dogs." Another adds: "Four pretty girls should never sleep on the street."  
7:40 a.m.: People continue to ask us about the wait. But I've got some serious reading to catch up on. Ron just got splinched (sorry, Book 7 spoiler). 
8:00 a.m.: We give this stand-by line thing up as a bad job. It's meant to rain tonight, anyway, and we shake our fists at the heavens and pray it pours so we can rationalize our disappointment. Damn that Annie Hathaway and her Devil-Wears-Prada popularity!
