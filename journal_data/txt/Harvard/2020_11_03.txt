After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an Art, Film, and Visual Studies concentrator, recent graduate Jasi D. Lampkin ’20 worked on a myriad of projects during her time at Harvard. Her thesis film, “The Harvard Bubble,” is a particularly notable entry in her body of work. The film, which follows a computer program called “The Harvard Bubble,” attempts to evaluate one Harvard undergraduate’s college experience and predict her likelihood to succeed beyond graduation. Lampkin simultaneously draws from her own experiences and explores Harvard’s institutional inequities. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Lampkin to discuss her thesis film, her artistic journey, and what it’s like creating art in the middle of a global pandemic.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you initially become involved in filmmaking?
Jasi D. Lampkin: In hindsight, I think I was always kind of on the path to becoming a filmmaker. When I was little, even from age four and five, my favorite thing to do was watch movies over and over again, and I used to love quoting them. I used to have stuffed animals and make up scenes and stuff like that, which people do, but I never really stopped doing that. Then in high school, I did a lot of theater, which is not the same as film. I thought I wanted to be an actress, and so I was really invested in doing all these productions at my high school. But then the first time I was ever backstage for a show — I was a stage manager and then I was a director and then I was an assistant director of three different shows senior year — I realized that I don’t like acting nearly as much as I like being behind the scenes and putting together a show or something for people to enjoy, entertainment like that. And then I also realized — critical choice — that I also didn’t love theater that much, because due to copyright and also just sort of the way the medium works, you can’t save anything that you do. It's not easy to share with other people, and you have your memories, but it’s not really what I’m up to. So when I got to college, I knew I wanted to do film, and yeah, I guess I've been doing film for four years now since my freshman year.
THC: Tell me a little bit about your thesis film. How did you come up with the concept?
JDL: Backing up to April of my junior year, I decided I wanted to do a thesis. I didn’t really have any ideas, truthfully, since up to that point I’d mostly done these awkward comedy-type fiction stories, so I was wondering if I was maybe going to try to write something like that, but I didn’t really have any good story ideas. But my mom had mentioned to me a long time ago that when she went to Harvard, she had no idea that there were any people of color there. She arrived for Visitas and was like, “woah,” and that’s why she ended up going: She was like, “maybe I can fit in here.” But before she visited, she just thought it was a place for the rich, the white, and the hyper-intellectual. And that got me thinking about peoples’ perceptions of Harvard and how the media has typically portrayed the University. And so I loosely had this idea, in April, “I want to make a movie about the Black experience at Harvard,” which is way too big, so I spent the following seven to eight months just panicking about that and trying to figure out where to start, because there are thousands of different experiences for Black students here — everyone does different things, we’re all very unique and individual, and I didn’t really know how I wanted to capture what it’s like to go here as a person of color. There’s so many layers and there’s so much history.
THC: What do you most want your audience to take away from your film?
JDL: I want people to realize that [Harvard] is a very complicated place. It’s not all bad or all good. I want people to take away that the institution itself is built by and built for, initially, one population of people: the rich, the white, and mostly the male. Now, obviously, things have changed and people from all different backgrounds and identities go there, but it doesn’t mean that the school has necessarily adjusted to accommodate everybody’s needs. I think there’s something to be said for the damage that is done when you throw people into a space that — although they’re going to be fine at and can work through and eventually prevail and succeed — it’s both psychologically and emotionally, and potentially even practically, damaging to not address the inequities and where people are different in their backgrounds and act like everyone’s the same. I want people to realize that because the place is so complicated, not everyone’s going through the same thing. It’s okay to feel like you’re having a hard time, because it is hard. I think for myself going through Harvard, I kind of thought there was something wrong with me or that I was doing something wrong because I was so tired, so sad, and so stressed. I was having fun, but I was feeling like I was maybe missing something. Like in the film, it’s a place of “equal opportunity,” but there aren’t that many efforts put forth to make sure that everybody’s getting the same baseline of experience.
THC: What kinds of stories do you want to tell going forward?
JDL: I’m definitely interested in the idea of going into my fiction. I love stories that are very character-driven, and the characters that I’m interested in are people who kind of don’t fit in for whatever reason. Maybe they’re awkward, maybe they’re way too passionate about something they believe in, and maybe they’re surrounded by people who aren’t like them. (That can lead into marginalized identities, things about gender, but can also be more general). I’m interested in really diving into this question of what it’s like to be alive. I think there’s a lot of both good and bad all the time in life; it’s very complicated, there’s a lot of contradictions, and it can be painful, honestly, to try to make new friends, or try to get a new job, or to discover yourself, but it can also be very fun and funny. I think there’s a lot of weird things in life that I like the idea of exploring more: just weird interactions. For example, my last film before my thesis was about two people who end up falling in love, they’re on a double date together, but one of them is such a know-it-all and the other is way too talkative and constantly distracted. That’s the kind of thing I’m talking about: people who are just people, and uncomfortable in the world as we all sort of are, but still able to be okay and be happy by the end.
THC: What’s your favorite part about being a filmmaker, and what are you proudest of in your work?
JDL: I think it's just so fun. I’m definitely proudest of this thesis just because it’s the piece I've worked on the longest — I’ve never worked on something for this long — I worked on it for a year and a half. And it was really nice to just be able to sit with a project for that long, and to really be able to think about it. Normally, I’m just panicking and scrambling with my projects and trying to meet a deadline and trying to get something done for school. But this was the first time I ever really was making something that I wanted to feel satisfied with by the end, and I wanted it to be right for me, honestly. I think what I love about being a filmmaker is kind of just getting to do whatever I want, and i think it’s so fun to make something meaningful out of something average, or out of regular life, or out of something that didn’t even exist before. I think it’s just like a really fun way to tell stories, and I think also I love how accessible it is compared to other mediums of art. Obviously there’s film that’s very esoteric and very high concept — and there’s also value in that as well — but overall across mediums, not everyone is going to take the time to read a book, not everyone’s going to go to a play, not everyone has money for a museum, but I think film is something easy to kind of put online and add subtitles and try to get as many people to see and experience as possible. So that’s also, compared to other art forms, why filmmaking is my favorite.
Jasi’s thesis film “The Harvard Bubble” is streaming until Jan. 31, 2021 on the Carpenter Center website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the POTUS and FLOTUS testing positive for COVID-19 to a fly landing on Vice President Mike Pence’s head during the Oct. 7 debate, the 2020 presidential race has been full of surprises. As with every election year, celebrities have injected themselves into the socio-political conversation, urging Americans to vote for their candidate of choice. The most recent development, however, has shocked the nation: Curtis James Jackson III, better known by his stage name 50 Cent, recently took to social media to endorse President Donald J. Trump.
On Oct. 19 the Queens native posted a photo of an infographic titled “Top Tax Rates By State Under Biden Tax Plan” to his 26.2 million Instagram followers. The visual contained statistics from California, New Jersey, New York State, and New York City at rates of 62.6%, 60%, 58%, and 62%, respectively.
The enraged “Before I Self Destruct” rapper exclaimed in a caption accompanying the photo, “WHAT THE F***! (VOTE ForTRUMP) IM OUT.” He continued, “F*** NEW YORK The KNICKS never win anyway.” He concluded his tirade with a fuming emoji. (50 Cent currently resides in New York City.)
The post, which has racked up over 464,000 likes and 66,800 comments, was met with mixed reactions. One user exclaimed, “Damn 62.5%!!!” Another commented, “#trump2020.” A disappointed supporter wrote, “You just lost a fan. Sorry.,” while a similarly miffed user fumed, “if you make over 400k a year YES be taxed!”
Other celebrities have challenged 50 Cent’s controversial endorsement. Radio presenter and author Charlamagne Tha God expressed his mixed reactions to the rapper’s social media outburst.
“Unlike 50 Cent, I can’t pick racism and bigotry and fascism,” he said in a virtual conversation with political commentator Lisa Kennedy Montgomery. “I can’t choose that over my finances.”
50 Cent’s ex Chelsea Handler took to Twitter to allege that she would help pay his taxes if he reversed his endorsement.
“You used to be my favorite ex-boyfriend,” she wrote in a tweet on Oct. 20 that has since received over 11,500 likes and 460 comments.
50 Cent’s emphatic endorsement of the current president marks a sharp departure from his previous comments on the businessman-turned-politician. In a tweet from September 2016, before Trump’s election to the presidency, the rapper implored, “Let us pray, lord please don’t let Trump into office. We will spin out of control” with an accompanying image of praying hands holding a rosary haloed in light.
In February 2019, 50 Cent appeared on “The Late Late Show with James Corden” alongside Senator Elizabeth Warren, revealing that Trump offered him $500,000 to simply show up at his 2017 inauguration. In response to Corden’s question of whether he accepted, 50 Cent replied, “All money’s not good money,” expressing his reservations about the political implications of attending. “Don’t bring me to fix the African American vote,” he said during the show. “Bring somebody else, I’ll see you later.” His words were punctuated by thunderous applause.
When Corden asked how Warren could attract young voters, 50 Cent advised her to stay connected to hip-hop culture, even going as far as to tell Warren to hang out with him when she became president.
It turns out, however, that 50 Cent’s anxieties about the financial burden of the Biden team’s tax strategy may not impact him to the extent he anticipates. A recent CNBC article breaking down Biden’s tax plan explained that taxpayers rarely pay full statutory rates, citing deductions, credits, loopholes, and “other sources of income” as ways individuals lower their effective tax rates.
Despite the intense backlash, 50 Cent will likely stand by his decision. On Oct. 20, following his initial Instagram post, he tweeted, “yeah, i don’t want to be 20cent.” To many, the artist’s choice to champion the POTUS marks a selfish gesture at the expense of the public good; to others, it demonstrates an understandable impulse to protect his finances. Amidst the chaos that has followed the rapper’s social media tirade, one thing remains clear: The towering music icon’s endorsement has only served to further polarize fans and Americans at large ahead of the momentous election to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m back in the studio for the first time in six months — the longest I’ve gone without stepping inside one since I was 8 or 9 years old. The feeling is nothing short of euphoric: to hold a real barre and not my dining room table, to travel across an open space, to turn on real marley. There’s just one thing that mars this bliss — I can’t look at myself in the mirror.
This is nothing new or unique to my experience: Dancers so often hyperfocus on their bodies because they are the tools with which they create their art. In ballet especially, being extremely thin is the aesthetic standard, something that developed over time similarly to the industries of fashion and modeling, and was perhaps concretized by the advent of the Balanchine aesthetic. Thinner lines, better art. Staring into mirrors all day critiquing positions and movements, too, contributes to an obsessive focus on one’s body, all of which is incredibly damaging both physically and mentally. Ballet typically requires that one start training at a very young age. Thus comments from teachers about how “I can see your lunch sticking out!” (a line I’ve heard countless times) as well as the general pressure of the industry and the world come during formative years and shape our thoughts and perceptions. Those kinds of thought processes are difficult to break; friends who have long since quit dancing still tell me how much they struggle with their body image, unable to escape the mentality drilled into them.
Body dysmorphia is defined as “an obsessive focus on a perceived flaw in one’s appearance,” most commonly on one’s shape, size, or weight. “Perceived” is the operative word — individuals who struggle with body dysmorphia perceive their bodies to look a different way than they actually do, which often causes distress and or leads them to take drastic action to change the way they look. And dancers, who tend to be immensely driven and determined individuals, often will do whatever it takes to improve, to get ahead, to be a better dancer. We live to perform, to create and share this art, and to do so “successfully,” one must please an artistic director, a company, or a casting director. As a result, dancers go to great lengths to stay thin, lose weight, or even stave off puberty because having the body of a child is what is desired by this industry. Studies have shown that dancers are three times more likely than the general population to suffer from an eating disorder.
In some ways, there’s even something enticing about giving your body up to the art, allowing others to dictate or shape it, and feeling like it is serving a larger purpose. But this artistic pursuit isn’t worth it when the price is your health. In a recent viral video, ballet star and popular Youtuber Kathryn Morgan discussed her decision to leave her company after they repeatedly denigrated her for being “too large” to perform in their shows. “No company contract, or title… is worth your mental or physical health,” she stresses in her video. For Morgan, the health consequences of undereating and overexercising were particularly severe due to the autoimmune disorder that had kept her away from dance for almost a decade prior. The harshness of their demands in asking her to lose more and more weight (“I was a size 2,” Morgan says), as well as the toxicity of the way in which they treated her (casting her in roles then pulling her two days before the show), carries echoes of countless other stories on the sometimes exceedingly negative environment in ballet. In fact, after Morgan posted her video on Youtube, it and the accompanying Instagram post were shared widely across social media, and countless other dancers began to add their experiences to the narrative.
Morgan’s Youtube channel has always been about transparency, sharing insights into the ballet industry with aspiring young dancers who look to her for inspiration. This video, and the resulting furor, might feel like yet another point on the laundry list of issues that the ballet industry, and the world, needs to grapple with. Yet it is exactly in this time of incredible social upheaval that I am most hopeful for change. There may be, to an extent, certain traditions and aesthetic standards that ballet must hold itself to, but at the end of the day this work is fundamentally about expression, storytelling, and emotion. It should be a dancer’s performance, movement quality, and artistry that ultimately determine their success, not their body shape or size.
Morgan is a beautiful performer, as evident in the clips she shared of rehearsal and stage in her video, and no matter what any company director thinks of her body, she is every inch the ballerina when she dances. Let’s remember what this art is really about, and stop leading students and working artists to damaging mental and physical spaces by making the body into the be-all-end-all. Let’s bring the joy and beauty back into this art form for those who make it what it is — the dancers.
—Sara Komatsu '23’s column “Backstage at the Ballet” explores anything and everything ballet-related, from its moments of joy and despair to the broader, systematic issues within it.

“Social distancing” has joined the ranks of everyday vocabulary in the pandemic era. Taking its place alongside phrases such as “herd immunity,” “asynchronous instruction,” and “quarantine,” the notion of physical isolation — once incredibly alien — has become as commonplace as a favorite oversized T-shirt.
While the concept of standing six feet away from other people is understandably foreign, humanity is no stranger to isolation. Despite Facebook, Instagram, and other tech giants’ claims that social media brings individuals closer together, one could argue that curated profiles, canned emoji reactions, and counting likes work to exacerbate human superficiality and loneliness — a phenomenon that “Social Distance,” Netflix’s new miniseries focusing on ordinary people braving the pandemic, attempts to explore.
The common struggle of reconciling with solitude is investigated throughout the series, particularly in episode one. Ike (Mike Colter), a good-natured man who has just broken up with his girlfriend, is depicted sitting alone through a Zoom screen. Though the quarantine has rendered the Zoom platform far too familiar for many, it is still largely unexplored in television. By inserting social media interfaces – namely Zoom, FaceTime, and Instagram – directly into the camera frame, “Social Distance” cleverly dips its feet into a novel form of televisual expression that is representative of the new normal.
Ike speaks to a tapestry of human thumbnails, later calling a friend from the help group. “It’s stupid,” he says after confiding about a recent heartbreak. “Especially when so many people have actual problems, you know?”
This guilt is a frequent motif throughout the series, one that colors the quarantine experiences of all the show’s characters in distinct and dynamic ways. Not only is there a guilt, as Ike mentioned, of feeling low in the midst of unprecedented casualties, but there is also a general sense of defeatism, of lethargy coupled with an inclination to do absolutely nothing. In episode four, a couple argues over the optimal way to pass the days in quarantine.
“We’re supposed to be doing nothing. That’s the whole lesson of this,” one man says. “You need to stop optimizing and just be.” In episode five, a man with a COVID-infected spouse FaceTimes his sister on the brink of tears:
“I feel like I’m failing all over the place,” he says.
Although the series’ dialogue sometimes walks the tightrope between authentic and unrealistic, the most memorable bits of conversation are these raw, brief bursts of emotional vulnerability. Similarly, while there are instances when performances are awkward and sometimes even halting, it is during these honest depictions of fear and loneliness that the actors shine through the screen.
As the series progresses, there is a palpable shift from the gentle warmth of human togetherness to the sharp edge of political crisis. In episode seven, introverted Chinese teenager Mia must reconcile with her crush’s perpetuation of racist rhetoric on social media. Though the 20-minute episode leaves the viewer wishing there was increased opportunity to explore Mia’s complex relationship to her Chinese heritage in an evolving American landscape, the abrupt realization of her crush’s racism illustrates an awakening that is as necessary as it is disruptive.
Intergenerational racial tension is further explored in the final episode, in which two Black men, an employed adolescent and his boss, are setting up cameras for a largely white preparatory school’s socially distanced graduation. The two engage in an escalating argument about the Black Lives Matter movement; while the teenager believes protest is the only step towards actual change, the employer argues that economic advancement is the singular answer to Black empowerment.
“That’s the problem with y’all generation,” the man says. “Think y’all discovered racism.”
“Why are we the ones that are expected to regulate our response,” the boy responds, “but no one expects them to stop killing us?” In its refusal to provide solutions to escalating racial and intergenerational conflicts (the argument crescendos until the boy quits his job in a rage), “Social Distance” paints a bleak future for collaborative change-making.
While a wide range of critical societal conundrums are well exhibited in each episode, the 20-minute timestamp restricts the creative breadth and emotional depth of each story. Though “Social Distance” endeavors to redress a status quo that is fraught with death, uncertainty, and political divisiveness, viewers are frequently left with a superficial, already anticipated takeaway in place of an earth-shattering revelation.
Despite its shortcomings, however, “Social Distance” makes a valiant effort to warm our lonely hearts. In a new normal where there are more technological devices in a room than there are people, in a world populated by more social media posts than candid conversations, “Social Distance” strives to elucidate the commonality in our mutual solitude.
We are all alone, and in that aloneness, we are together. Each 20-some minute episode of the televisual anthology illuminates heartwarming instances of human connection in a tragically disconnected status quo. Whether it be a Type A professor learning to care for her mother’s caretaker’s daughter or an eclectic family uniting over Zoom for a virtual funeral, the contents of each episode reflect an intense reverence for the enduring connective tissue of the human experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Poetry has long occupied a complicated position in the literary tradition. At once venerated and dismissed, feared and mocked, the ancient genre is one of the most demanding for both writers and readers alike. Poetry necessitates continuous scrutiny: Every choice — whether it be capitalization, a spatial rearrangement, a line break, or an image — confers an important meaning to the text as a whole. The subtle, symbolic complexity of the genre is what so often renders it frustrating and inaccessible.
The form, however, has experienced an abrupt resurgence in recent weeks. On Oct. 8, 2020, American poet Louise Glück was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, turning heads from around the world. Articles abounded, book sales skyrocketed, and critics debated. Just one question remains: Who is Louise Glück?
A New York native and professor of English at Yale University, Glück is a towering voice in the contemporary American canon. Currently residing in Cambridge, Mass., she is the author of twelve books of poetry, some of which include “The Garden” (1976), “The Triumph of Achilles” (1985), Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Wild Iris” (1992), “Averno” (2006), and National Book Award-winning “Faithful and Virtuous Night” (2014).
Both stoic and emotional, shrewdly economical and radically expansive, Glück’s poetry charts nuanced pathways to understanding by challenging and reimagining critical aspects of the human condition. Drawing from nature and mythology as prisms of inquiry, she writes with knife-like observational powers, penning meditations that are merciless in their uncomfortable honesty.
The most striking quality of Glück’s poetic voice is her perpetual awareness of death: its voice, its contours, its devastating and at times imperceptible ubiquity. Oftentimes, she employs natural imagery to demonstrate that endings serve as beginnings, and vice versa. In her poems, flowers have mouths and landscapes bear witness to the desperation of human folly. Water sings of loss, and white lilies eulogize the tenderness and transience of passion.
Glück’s literary and imagistic obsessions are the body, flowers, and decay. In every book — and perhaps every poem — Glück scrutinizes and reimagines the nature of endings. Death inverts itself, yielding to rebirth and reinvention. The old lapses into the new, and the liminal spaces bridging past, present, and future become confused, expanding into luminous meditations on the function of memory and distance in preserving life.
It is impossible to step into the world of Glück without considering the question — the problem — of grief. More than any other idea, grief, that human reaction to loss, is the thematic core through which Glück probes the melancholy, rearrangements, confusions, and psychic disruptions that accompany change and death.
To characterize Glück’s engagement with grief as total or assured, however, would be deeply remiss. It is in the tension between her simultaneous dependence on and intense distrust of mourning that her most astounding arguments arise.
In as early as her third collection, Glück adopts a distinct poetic technique: the conferring of sentience to natural objects as a means of questioning the human condition. This narrative methodology expands in her later works, particularly in the “The Wild Iris” (1992). In the poem “The Garden,” included in the book of the same title (1976), Glück questions the implications of self-awareness. Using the second-person in both an accusatory and tender manner, she writes, “Yet / there is still something you need,/ your body, so soft, so alive, among the stone animals.” The poem concludes, “Admit that it is terrible to be like them, / beyond harm.”
Through these “stone animals,” Glück concedes the burden and privilege of feeling. By evoking the oxymoron of being “beyond harm” as “terrible,” she posits the necessity of being harmed — of feeling pain, grief, loss, and fragility — as an integral part of human existence. In this implicit insistence, Glück intimates the possibility of virtual death for humans, one brought about by the end of feeling, of caring enough to be harmed.
The theme of sentient beings as inherently fragile also pervades her poems “The Red Poppy” and “The Wild Iris,” both published in her seventh book “The Wild Iris” (1992). Whether this fragility is tragic or triumphant depends on the reader. Glück’s masterful use of subversion in both texts, however, seems to suggest the latter.
Glück concludes “The Red Poppy” — written in the perspective of the opiate flower — with the lines, “I speak / because I am shattered.” Through her cryptic yet expansively beautiful verse, she argues that the communication of meaning — of anything of genuine or enduring value — is predicated on anguish. Her masterfully understated lines exemplify the devastating breadth of her emotional understanding. Herein resides Glück’s iconic poetic contradiction, that tension between stoicism and boundless emotion, between disciplined confinement and transcendence.
In “The Wild Iris,” Glück again employs grief, death, and estrangement as forms of meditative empathy. The piece begins, “At the end of my suffering / there was a door.” The lines exemplify her nuanced understanding of grief not as an end in itself but, rather, as a site of dynamic transformation, a portal into another iteration of reality and the self. The speaker continues, “Hear me out: that which you call death / I remember.” By narrating the poem through the perspective of the titular flower — a pattern consistent throughout the entirety of the book — Glück subverts and repurposes the notion of an end. Death is no longer the final destination. Rather, it is an experience to be scrutinized and remembered, to be held to the light of the mind and turned, slowly, as though questioning a witness.
Toward the conclusion of “The Wild Iris,” Glück writes, “whatever / returns from oblivion returns / to find a voice.” These lines serve as one of the most nuanced, stunning encapsulations of the celebrated poet’s artistic impulse. To describe the recently crowned Nobel Laureate’s literature solely through vocabularies of grief and austerity is tragically misdirected: It perpetuates the very disposition that she so artfully strives to resist. In writing lucidly and richly about loss, Glück resists total grief. Instead, she insists on the presence of transformative qualities — retrospection, dynamism, glimpsed beauty — that allow for revival after even the most intense periods of devastation.
The outpouring of articles in the past days detailing Glück’s career and corpus of poetic work is expected, even unavoidable. The swift turnaround, however, seems ironic considering the lengthy introspection her poetry demands. Recent reflections on Glück’s writing — likely ones hastily assembled in the span of days, perhaps even hours — are steeped in observations of austerity, desolation, and bleakness. Though these are undeniably important themes in the Long Island native’s texts, when considered alone they fail to embody the towering ambition of Glück’s foray into the complexities of the psychic and emotional interior.
So what, then, does it mean to read Glück? What does she stand for, and how? More broadly, what does it mean to truly read poetry, to engage with it in a manner that deeply unnerves, stirring something unspeakable within us and daring us to live?
Though these questions are deeply complex in the least, it helps to frame them through that which Glück does best: contradiction. To read Glück is to embrace the confounding enigma of change as both an enabler and a destroyer. To read Glück is to grasp the affective complexities that impel care and violence. To read Glück is to lament the inherent misery of the human condition while simultaneously leaning into glimpsed moments of enduring beauty.
Perhaps most important, to read Glück is to be tricked. As readers, when we step into the world of a poem, we find ourselves standing at what resembles a precipice, the finality of an end. Steadily, the piece progresses. We watch as the landscape shifts and reassembles — slowly, imperceptibly, then all at once — and a new world shows its face.

The “Frozen” franchise, it seems, has become an unexpected companion throughout these several months of the pandemic. On Mar. 13, the day Donald Trump finally declared COVID-19 a national emergency, Disney released “Frozen 2” on Disney+ — months ahead of schedule and a welcome relief to fans and families entering quarantine. Throughout April and May, Disney produced a made-from-home series of absolutely adorable animated shorts called “Home with Olaf,” culminating in an original tear-jerking quarantine ballad written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. And on Jun. 26, Disney released “Into the Unknown: Making Frozen 2,” an immersive and uplifting docu-series about the making of the animated sequel: a bittersweet reminder of the magic of coming together in-person.
And now, as we enter our ninth (!) month of quarantine, Olaf returns in an eight-minute animated short, titled “Once Upon a Snowman.” Written and directed by Dan Abraham and Trent Correy, the short tells Olaf’s origin story — that is, the brief time between when he is magicked up by Elsa in her “Let it Go” sequence and when he first meets Anna and Kristoff. In these eight minutes, we finally get answers to the questions no one ever asked about Olaf: why he’s obsessed with summer, why he doesn’t come with a nose, and — most iconically — why he loves warm hugs.
Olaf is, of course, adorable. In the same way that puppies are cuter than adult dogs, newly sentient, slightly uncertain Olaf is somehow even more lovable than his more assuredly wise-cracking future self. “I appear to be some sort of snowman,” Olaf says, followed by an iconic Josh Gad chuckle, and then, “What am I even saying? Who am I?”
The short, with Olaf at its center, gives the animators ample opportunity to show off their chops. His appendages and body segments detach freely, making for a never-ending supply of visual gags and mechanical creativity: “Have you seen our butt?”, his head says to his torso in perhaps the most whimsical chase scene of the “Frozen” franchise. This — plus the masterful lighting, vivid backdrops, and flawless production design — once again cements Walt Disney Animation Studios’ place at the forefront of animation.
The short also contains plenty of callbacks to the original film. Kristoff, Anna, and Elsa make brief appearances, as do Oaken the shopkeeper and a pack of hungry wolves. Die-hard “Frozen” fans will also recognize Anna’s coronation dress being sold at Oaken’s, as well as the picnic blanket from “Some Things Never Change” flashing by for (quite literally) a single frame.
Deviating from “Frozen Fever” and “Olaf’s Frozen Adventure,” this short sadly lacks its own original songs, but motifs from the original film surface in the score: Most obviously, themes from “In Summer” and “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?”, but also a lighter, bouncier version of “Sorcery” (the haunting leitmotif that plays when Elsa initially flees Arendelle in the original film). In the short, this theme plays as Olaf begins his journey — a musical parallel that emphasizes Olaf’s creation as the manifestation of Elsa’s repressed childhood joy, a physical embodiment of the happiness and fun she yearned for after being locked away.
One could argue that, of all the characters in the “Frozen” franchise, Olaf has had the most on-screen character development — becoming sentient in “Frozen”; learning the true meaning of Christmas in “Olaf’s Frozen Adventure”; grappling with anger, accepting change, and literally dying in “Frozen 2.” Ultimately, however, he’s still the same lovable, goofy, relentlessly optimistic snowman we met almost a decade ago: a reminder that, even in these uncertain times, (to use a line from “Frozen 2”), some things never change.

CW: The following piece contains references to sexual assault. 
From its first scene, “Grand Army,” demands your full attention. Netflix’s new series about teenagers at a competitive New York City high school begins in the girls’ locker room, a microcosm of the show’s universe: crowded, grey-toned, and buzzing with energy and characters you might actually want to be friends with. The camera follows aspiring dance team captain Joey Del Marco (Odessa A’Zion) as she barges into a bathroom stall where Grace (Keara Graves) sits, weeping. Totally unfazed, Joey kneels on the floor, asks “are you ready?”, reaches up and, in a painfully drawn-out sequence, struggles to extract a stray condom from inside her friend. Miraculously, she succeeds, and the two hug in a genuinely endearing moment. The scene embodies the show’s greatest draw — a gritty, authentic portrait of teenage friendships (particularly between women) brought alive by a talented cast of young, mostly breakout actors.
“Grand Army” strives for this no-looking-away realism throughout its first season, making the show at once mesmerizing and hard to watch. While the show joins a growing cadre of “Euphoria”-core dramas exploring high school life, it replaces “Euphoria”’s sun-splashed, aestheticized vision of suburban adolescence with a claustrophobic, constantly-shifting vignette of life in the city. Its characters are (for the most part) compelling, charismatic, and complicated. Their friendships feel genuine and deep, drawing on years of shared history and loyalty as they navigate the school’s web of social groups and deal with its endemic racism and sexism. In short, the characters feel remarkably real — which is why the show’s sometimes extreme storylines, from a terrorist bombing in the first episode to a leaked college essay and, later, a confusing fake bomb threat, don’t drag “Grand Army” down as much as they could.
Though the show has a long lineup of supporting characters, it focuses on the struggles of five main characters: Dominique “Dom” Pierre (Odley Jean), an aspiring psychologist struggling to support her family while finishing high school; Siddhartha Pakam (Amir Bageria), a competitive swimmer grappling with his sexuality; Jayson Jackson (Maliq Johnson), a passionate saxophone player who protests against the school’s racist disciplinary policies; Joey Del Marco (A’Zion), a dancer and revered figure in the school until she accuses classmates of rape; and Leila Kwan Zimmer (Amalia Yoo), a lost freshman desperate to fit in. The show tracks all five stories, but Joey, Jayson and Dom’s emerge as the central plot points, grappling with systemic injustice, privilege, and disadvantage in moving, unexpected ways.
“Grand Army” is an adaptation of showrunner and writer Katie Cappiello’s play “Slut,” performed at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival. The show’s portrayal of sexual violence, specifically, is unique in the landscape of modern TV; it joins Michaela Coel’s groundbreaking “I May Destroy You” in offering a visceral, unflinching look at the aftermath of assault, social stigma, and dangerous versions of victim blaming by another name. At times, though, the show’s depiction of sexual violence feels gratuitous, going for dramatic effect rather than empathy towards survivors. While it’s important not to shy away from the devastation of sexual violence or to euphemize it, the scene in which the assault occurs is brutally drawn-out, while the show rushes past subtler opportunities to examine the creeping shadow of rape culture. For example, in the show’s first episode, the swim team makes a “Bomb P*ssy List” on Instagram, posting pictures of the women at Grand Army they most want to have sex with, but beyond some feeble criticism by a member of the team that doesn’t want his sister included, the plotline is largely forgotten and dismissed as a stupid bro-bonding experience rather than a symptom of the school’s pervasive rape culture.
As Joey deals with the devastating fallout of her assault, Jayson and his friend Owen (Jaden Jordan) face the school board’s punitive, biased disciplinary policies after a lighthearted prank against Dom turns serious. Jayson, given a shorter suspension than Owen, struggles to protest his friend’s exclusion, leading to a grim several episodes as their friendship fractures. Meanwhile Dom, whose grueling daily efforts to support her family come to light when Jayson and Owen’s prank costs her $200, struggles to stay afloat and maintain her studies.
As Dom and Sid advance towards their goals (although not without some challenges) and each navigate first love, Leila evolves from a nervous, sympathetic outcast to a perfectly-hateable villain. Seriously, her transformation from well-intentioned to delusional nightmare happens so fast it’ll give you whiplash — but it’s one of the show’s most unpredictable narrative choices, and it unfolds artfully. A jarring, seemingly unnecessary gag in which Leila imagines herself as a comic-book zombie queen gets explained in the final episode, revealing that what appeared to be a cutesy, empowering fantasy is actually a manifestation of Leila’s simmering toxicity. Even at her worst, though, she’s still recognizable as a completely misguided girl trying to fit in and feel desirable. This nuance traces back to Amalia Yoo’s gripping performance, which combines with A’Zion and Jean’s to make the show what it is.
However, as much as Grand Army may feel like a step in the right direction for teen TV with storylines focused on BIPOC and female characters, the behind-the-scenes dynamics of the show call into question its commitment to sincere representation. Cappiello, a white woman and former teacher who created the show based on experiences with students, was accused of racism in the writers’ room by several writers earlier this year. Ming Peiffer, one former writer for the show, said she and three other writers of color on the show left after Cappiello criticized one writer’s hair and refused to listen to their concerns that the show was becoming “poverty porn.” Indeed, elements of the show’s exploration of class and misogyny sometimes seem gratuitous — for example, Dom’s sudden decision to get married (as a high school junior) because the groom offers to pay her family if she helps him get a green card.
Ultimately, these elements of the narrative detract from the more subversive, interesting work that the show does to confront some of the problems facing teenagers in one of the world’s biggest cities. The series is part of Netflix’s greater efforts to expand the diversity of its storytelling and characters, a crucially important step towards equity in media — after all, as Joey says in her English class during Episode 4, “The world just can’t get enough of shoving white boy stories down our throats and labelling them as American culture at its finest.” This show is not perfect, certainly, but may be worth checking out for fans of “Euphoria,” “I May Destroy You,” and other interpersonal dramas grounded by strong female characters — so long as you know what to expect.

Despite the hiccup in production presented by the pandemic, the inimitable David Letterman returned this October with Season Three of his Netflix show, “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.” Featuring none other than Kim Kardashian, Robert Downey Jr., Dave Chappelle, and Lizzo, this latest (and necessarily shorter) season provides intimate, meaningful portraits of celebrities while also capturing the gravitas of the present historical moment.
“My Next Guest,” which reads a bit like a longform talk show, displays a very different Letterman than the acerbic host of “Late Night.” Nowhere is this more evident than in his interactions with Kim Kardashian, his first guest of the season. Though Kanye, whom he interviewed in Season Two, now sits in the audience, Letterman exhibits a similar restraint in discussion of the more outrageous presentations of celebrity life with Kardashian. While recounting the traumatic Paris robbery (in which Kardashian had nearly $9 million in jewelry stolen), she explains that Kanye had flown out to Paris that day, because he “didn’t like my outfit,” to which Letterman responded with only the mildly sarcastic “If that isn’t true love…” — where he might previously have skewered such an account of celebrity extravagance.
Despite this restraint, Letterman does push Kardashian to reveal her political standing, inquiring after her advocacy for prison reform, interactions with President Trump, and how she felt about the actions of the current administration. Kardashian carefully refuses to answer, a frustrating response as viewers watch the episode so close to the election.
Unsurprisingly, Letterman seems far more comfortable with Robert Downey Jr. than with Kardashian. Despite broaching serious topics like alcoholism and addiction, this interview features far more banter between host and guest; Letterman opens the show saying, “I’ll do most of the talking,” and then launches into an anecdote about his hip problems. Adding to the good humour was footage of Downey and Letterman touring the actor’s ranch home with its “menagerie,” which included alpacas, goats, and pigs. These cutaways break up the interview portions nicely, and give them a documentary-like feel that fill out the portrait of the celebrity more fully.
At the start of Downey’s interview, Letterman notes his appreciation for the live, enthusiastic audience, saying, “the thrill that runs up my spine is indescribable.” Unfortunately, these words would come back to haunt him, as this is the last interview he conducts before the pandemic hit in full force. His next interview with Dave Chapelle is held outside, with a much smaller, masked, and socially distant audience. His interview with Lizzo does not feature an audience at all.
The restrictions of the pandemic do not detract from the quality of the content; rather, by not shying away from showing the masks and precautions, these episodes are imbued with further relevance and significance. Watching b-roll of the prep at the start of Lizzo’s episode, with temperature checks and measurements of the distance between chairs, a viewer can’t help but feel the archival significance that these sorts of moments, captured on television, may come to bear.
In conversation with Dave Chappelle — who brings wonderful ideas about art, fame, parenting, and more — Letterman also discusses the summer’s events concerning George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. He expresses the gratitude he felt at seeing Chappelle’s response to the event, feeling Chappelle to be a leader. The cutaway clips, which show the two walking around the small town of Yellow Springs, Ohio where Chappelle resides, are even more valuable than before, as they captured windows and storefronts papered with Black Lives Matter signs.
Letterman also discusses activism with Lizzo, who is vocal on her various social media platforms (including TikTok) about BLM, voting, and body positivity. Yet the very advantage of the longer format of this Netflix series is proven here, as she also is able to provide a nuanced, intimate perspective on her activism. “I'm sick of being an activist just because I'm fat and Black,” Lizzo says. “I want to be an activist because I’m intelligent, because I care about issues, because my music is good, because I wanna help the world.”
Though there is no audience, and the two don’t leave her house for the cutaway segments, the interview as well as clips and images from Lizzo’s career and footage from her appearance on “Late Show with David Letterman,” serve to create an even more intimate, mini-“musician’s documentary” sort of episode. Lizzo’s passion for spreading positivity shines through, with uplifting clips of her leading packed concerts in screamed affirmations that are sure to bring a smile to viewers’ faces.
With “My Next Guest,” Letterman brings us more than late night television entertainment. Though still, at times, humorous the way a talk show would be, these episodes are filled with important, meaningful conversations and capture both complex, interesting people, and a significant time in history.

It is of no surprise that “Just Us: An American Conversation,” Claudia Rankine’s sixth collection of poetry, is a beautiful work of art. Rankine, author and Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry at Yale, is known for her provocative work on themes of race, class, and gender, and her brilliant and astoundingly accessible mind has once again invited us to ask ourselves necessary questions on race that push beyond our comfort zones. This book combines poetry, narrative, interview, and visual art into a contemplation on the far-reaching nature of American anti-Black racism and belonging in American society.
Comprised of 21 reflections, “Just Us” begins with a section of six poems titled “what if,” immediately priming the reader for the contemplative nature of the book. She lays out multiple questions throughout the poems, all revolving around ideas of race, struggle, and the desire for change, and ends the last poem with her intention for the book. She asks “What if what I want from you is new, newly made / a new sentence in response to all my questions.” Her rhetorical devices transform into an invitation to participate and an imposition of difficult reflection.
“Just Us” is poetic yet understandable. In each of the next 20 sections, Rankine structures the book around interviews she conducts with various people in her life, ranging from the spectrum of quotidian interactions with strangers to formalized interviews of colleagues, the very nature of which requires a conversational analysis. These interviews, however, are not conventionally transcribed as conversations but are instead written as essays. She invites us into her own narrative consciousness.
The lack of quotation marks in her dialogue transforms the questions she asks them into questions she asks herself, and into questions she asks the reader. She creates what she aptly calls an “American conversation” in a manner that questions the complicated, invites reflection, and implicates uncomfortable participation in American racist thought all while withholding judgment upon the reader. She interrogates others, asking “Am I being silence?” and interrogates herself “Am I being silenced,” and asks us, without “Are you silencing me?” Are we, as individuals, being silenced, or are we silencing others?
She poses unanswerable questions that evade nice, bow-wrapped conclusions. When she asks these deep questions about the nature of race and racism, Rankine herself does not know the answer. She admits, “I don’t know. I’m simply exploring and not insisting.” Rhetorically, she places these ideas in the reader’s mind while giving them the information to conclude, but she does not answer them directly, because she cannot know the complete answer herself, and she knows we cannot know either. She gives the reader the opportunity to discover themselves within the fabric of our American society by implicating without accusing.
But don’t be fooled ­­— she doesn’t let the reader off the hook either. In considering the complex racial dynamic of quotidian experiences, she forces the reader to acknowledge that these interactions and reactions are unavoidable. It is impossible, as an American, to evade completely the structures and institutions that surround us — whether we like it or not. She forces us to interrogate our own actions to see how we shape belonging in this country.
Rankine employs a sophisticated inclusion of sources to beautifully represent the difficulties of speaking on race as a Black person. As if her authority is not enough and as if her experiences are not enough, Rankine interrupts the narrative to provide page-long citations in a way that challenges a person’s tendency to demand “legitimate” references especially from Black women when speaking about their lives.
“Just Us” forces the reader to face these uncomfortable realities which we, as individuals, may not want to acknowledge. But Rankine seeks to provide avenues through which we, as a society, can heal. She admits that questions like these may fall short of providing answers, but without disturbing the racial social contracts within quotidian interactions, we will never be able to reconcile with the tragedies that still befall the American public today.
Within these contemplative and sometimes difficult to read interviews, Rankine effectively includes us in this valuable practice of self-reflection. She makes us question, who is included within the polity of “us”? How do our actions harm others? How do our words exclude others? What are the answers embedded in these questions and will we ever solve them? Rankine ends in a stroke of optimism — we may not know the answers at this moment, but we do know one thing: We are here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first episode of HBO's six-episode miniseries, showrunner Nicole Kidman graces the screen as wealthy New Yorker Grace Fraser. Accompanied by her on-screen husband Jonathan (Hugh Grant) and middle school-aged son Henry (Noah Jupe), the upper class walks through Central Park on the way to and from work and school, makes messes in the kitchen, and appears at high-class fundraisers for Henry’s elite school, Reardon, alongside a host of other elite families.
One of these mothers, Elena Alves (Matilda De Angelis), stands apart from the rest. Her son is at Reardon on scholarship, a harsh contrast to the exorbitant lives of the typical student. This dash of diversity — which the show itself jokes about during a luxurious school auction — is a unique and almost picturesque representation of diversity today. A seemingly normal woman without the thrills of first class life attempts to infiltrate the world of New York’s elite only to show up one morning murdered. Quickly, the harsh, dark tone of “The Undoing” floods the screen, overshadowing the gold and glam of these Tiffany’s and Sach’s Fifth Ave. families. A missing spouse, the hush-hush death, and a mystery surrounding Grace’s well-to-do father sets up this series to stay intriguing and interesting throughout its run.
Unsurprisingly, with such a star-studded cast, the show also pulled a phenomenal crew behind the camera. With Susanne Bier from critically acclaimed “The Night Manager” as director and David E. Kelley, from the Emmy awardwinning “Big Little Lies,” the show has pulled out all the stops for what should be another award-winning venture. With Kidman on-screen and Kelley behind it, it’s hard not to compare “The Undoing” to its predecessor.
Whether from the unusual nature, delays, and stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic, the writing for this show seems less developed, less polished than that of “Big Little Lies.” The majority of the writing is witty and intriguing, paired well with the acting talent, but the odd moment stands out. The star-studded cast has to force the occasional scene where dialogue detracts from the progression of the story. These moments come off as clunky and uncomfortable. Quick and dirty attempts to build discomfort around the stand-out mother Elena come off as unrefined and unusual for a big-budget HBO miniseries.
In the moments where the writing seems to drag, the scoring by Victor Reyes catches the ear, evoking strong emotions from the pit of the stomach. The show's score is raw and emotional. Even in the most lighthearted moments, these ominous overtones weave their way into scenes — slowly and artfully building to the episode’s climax and cliffhanger. Using a beautifully choreographed mix of New York City sounds and looming, gentle tones, Reyes sets the mood and creates subtle foreshadowing. Every moment Elena takes center stage of the screen, moody, eerie chords establish the mystery that surrounds her.
One thing this show does exceptionally well is establish its characters. From the moment Nicole Kidman enters the screen, her character, Grace, begins building and taking form. We get to see her anxiety dealing with the other high-class, high-strung mothers, her ease while working with her patients as a successful psychiatrist, and her joy in being kind and caring to Elena, a mother in need. Hugh Grant’s Jonathan, too, excels. This charming man is one of New York’s finest oncologists, but presents as down-to-earth and witty as he jokes with his son on a walk to school or cheers up a young leukemia patient. At the end of the episode, all of the outward-in views of the family — as if the audience were other parents at Reardon — shatter as fragments of truth come out about Jonathan’s true personality and the fragility of Grace’s life.
Although only six episodes in length, this limited series adaptation of the 2014 novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz, “You Should Have Known,” brings intrigue and excitement to the screen in a time where streaming services are vying for the attention of an at-home audience. With its phenomenal casting and scoring, the remaining episodes of “The Undoing” are sure to be thrilling as they dive deeper into the lives of the Frasers.

Released Sept. 11, the second season of the Netflix original show “Family Business” picked up right where it left off — and not just in terms of the plot. Indeed, the second season of this show was just as ridiculous, light-hearted, and downright funny as the first, adding a second chapter to a story so entertaining that it makes the promise of a third something to genuinely look forward to.
Created by French writer Igor Gotesman, the second season of “Family Business” sees actor Jonathan Cohen star as the goofy, charismatic, and clumsy Joseph Hazan, still a key figure but now no longer the driving force of the marijuana-growing operation into which he dragged his quaint but fracturing family in the first season. This season picks up a year after the end of the first, and tracks the Hazan family as they continue to expand their operation; yet, as always, unforeseen events continue to drag the family deeper into the illicit business they never imagined they would be a part of.
The writers’ number one rule for this second season was simple: Don’t take anything too seriously. Like “The Office,” “Family Business” draws its humor from many sources, from Clémentine’s painful lack of self-awareness to Joseph’s ridiculous attempts to scare his family out of the weed business (for example, placing a crow on their doorstep in place of a horse’s head, which he couldn’t muster the will to cut off). And, like “The Office,” the humor employed in “Family Business” works. Here, cringe-worthy moments meet the completely unexpected and, at times, the wildly inappropriate, and the result is reminiscent of the spirit of the NBC cult classic.
The key player in most jokes is the witty and overconfident Joseph. The success of the second season is, of course, a testament to how well Cohen is able to interpret this character; in addition, the other members of the cast mesh well together to create the semblance of a quirky, dysfunctional family that is perfectly suited to their bold (and highly illegal) endeavor.
The plot of this season moves quickly, and its pace compliments the show’s dismissal of characters’ motivations and its choice to instead focus on the absurdity of the situations in which they find themselves. The storyline itself does require a robust suspension of disbelief — viewers must accept, for example, that the Hazans are able to escape detection by the police as they run their business next to a Gendarmerie shooting range — but this is acceptable for a show that has no intention of bringing groundbreaking thematic elements to the screen, that simply aims to draw comedy from the absurd.
It is worth mentioning that “Family Business” is a French show, though it can be watched in English, for which subtitles are also available. And while most American viewers may shy away from the French, something major would be lost by foregoing the experience of listening to the show in its original language. When the characters speak in French, their intonation, their turns of phrase, and even the profanities they choose to use are, as one would expect, perfectly in tune with the situations in which they find themselves. “Family Business” would just not be the same, for example, without the expressiveness of Joseph’s (Cohen’s) language, which is unmatched in the English dubbing of the show. Aside from using voices that are a terrible fit for their actors, the English audio translation also fails to come up with an answer for the intonation and word choice — especially Cohen’s habit of repeating phrases like “c’est bien” or “pas mal” or the modifier “très” — that Cohen uses so elegantly to convey the tactlessness and absurd optimism of Joseph’s character.
In the end, it would be difficult to finish the second season of “Family Business” and not wish that the third had already been released. The cliff-hanger ending of the last episode is merely the icing on the cake: The show’s cast, pacing, and comedic elements are all so well put together that such a suspenseful ending is hardly necessary; in fact, it is these elements that make the show work so well. Indeed, if the second season is any indication, “Family Business” may be well on its way to becoming a cult classic in its own right.

Fantasy readers rejoiced when news broke in late 2019 that Susanna Clarke was returning to the literary scene. “Piranesi” hit shelves in mid-September, capping a sixteen-year wait between novels. It is engrossing and enigmatic, a testament to Clarke’s personal resilience and literary prowess.
Clarke’s debut novel, “Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,” won praise upon its release in 2004. Longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, it is the platonic ideal of the word “tome.” Its nearly 800-page length enriches Clarke’s stuffy and quintessentially British characters, echoing the 19th-century classics that now inundate high schoolers with their chunky prose. But in Clarke’s hands, this writing is nostalgic and entirely fitting. Along with “The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories,” Clarke appeared content to remain in this magic-filled but deeply temporal world.
Unfortunately, life got in the way. Clarke suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome, which slowed progress on her second novel down to a halt. In an interview with The Guardian, she described how her condition kept her “bound in one place by illness,” leading her to reconsider her goal of writing a sequel to her debut. While she left the world of “Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell” behind, she crafted an equally stunning landscape in its wake.
“Piranesi” contains the journal entries of a devoted inhabitant of the House, an infinite composition of classical rooms with statues filling each wall. Some of these rooms are high enough to contain clouds, others low enough to contain oceans. Like many of us during quarantine, the protagonist Piranesi can barely remember life before the House. He spends his days exploring its many rooms and chambers. His only human friend — Piranesi often talks to statues and bones — is the Other, who searches for a way out. Suffice to say, Piranesi is trapped.
While not even one-third of the length of “Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,” “Piranesi” packs a lot of punch. What the novel lacks in length, it makes up for in depth. Every room is lovingly populated with detail-heavy statues, and Piranesi’s aggressive indexing of his journals harkens back to the pages-long footnotes of “Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.” His entry titles range from intensely descriptive (“The Other describes the circumstances under which it will be right to kill me”) to downright hilarious (“Do trees exist?”).
Bibliographical humor aside, Piranesi is submissive and fundamentally broken. He instills in the House godlike powers (“The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its kindness infinite”) and gives it the ultimate respect of capitalization. It would be cliché to describe the House as a character in itself — Piranesi’s prayers never provoke a response — but its layers serve to augment this subservient aspect of Piranesi’s personality. Clarke’s House is both cold and unfeeling and bright and full of life.
Piranesi exhibits the same deference to the House as he does the Other, whom he relies on for companionship and occasional supplies. The Other is not his other, someone who would help make him whole again. This Other is manipulative and sees Piranesi as a means to an end. Clarke is no stranger to crafting complex power dynamics between characters — see Norrell and Childermass in her debut — and Piranesi’s relationship with the Other evolves and twists into a web of lies and deception, underpinned by control.
One can’t blame Piranesi for his demeanor. After all, spending years in an infinitely expanding house would be immensely traumatizing, and there are hints that Piranesi is not the first to succumb to this mental torture (e.g. the aforementioned bones). He somehow remains a decent man through his struggles, retaining a childlike innocence as he comforts a stray albatross and assists the Other in his search for Knowledge, capitalization intentional.
As a narrative device, Piranesi’s journals improve once his encyclopedic memory starts to falter. In the early chapters, his pithy titles give away almost too much information. Later on, the dual pressure of processing new information and the weight of being confined together introduce doubt into his accounts, forcing a more thoughtful read that is altogether more fulfilling.
Piranesi’s predicament parallels Clarke’s own battles with fatigue. His struggle is hers: reaching to break free of a seemingly endless rabbit hole. Clarke’s case offers hope; on the other side, maybe her character can offer the world something as unique and beautiful as “Piranesi.”

Over the course of his nearly five decade career, John Lithgow has played a plethora of characters, ranging from an apprehensive banker to an incredibly short and incredibly evil animated villain. Most recently, he assumed two interconnected roles: a poet with a razor-sharp wit and masterful command of rhyming couplets as well as an illustrator who renders risible cartoons of boorish politicos. Lithgow’s flawless performance as both an author and a caricaturist can be witnessed not by way of the silver screen, but through the pages of his latest work, “Trumpty Dumpty Wanted a Crown: Verses for a Despotic Age.” Following Lithgow’s first book of political poems (“Dumpty: The Age of Trump in Verse”), “Trumpty Dumpty” is a clever, pertinent, and uproarious poetic lampoon of the second half of President Donald Trump’s disastrous reign — it is an unapologetic masterpiece far more deserving of a crown than “Dumpty,” the text’s primary target.
The book begins with a collection of poems examining Trump’s impeachment in late 2019 and navigates its way through the bevy of misjudgements, oversights, and lies that form the fragile membrane of the current administration. With the exception of Lithgow’s introduction, the satirization of Trump and his cohorts’ instability and incompetency is realized in the rhyming couplets, a literary device incorporated into all 30 poems. Although the repetitive usage of one rhyme scheme may initially seem unimaginative, Lithgow manages to craft poems that are not only distinctive, but also hilarious, engaging, and surprising.
What characterizes each poem’s allure, however, is its duplexity: They simultaneously introduce a note of levity and deride the socio-political circus that is the Trump administration. As one reads Lithgow’s diverse collection of parodic and snarky laments, they are invited to engage in a guffaw-inducing affair, one which welcomes those who are neither fluent in political jargon nor possess ample knowledge of governmental proceedings.
This accessibility allows “Trumpty Dumpty’s” commentary to have an ubiquitous influence that can be felt by all readers. Lithgow’s inclusion of brief profiles of the corrupt politicians he skewers (poetically, of course) removes the potential for misinterpretation — Lithgow’s agenda, unlike Trump’s, is clear and refreshingly honest. Politicians are not given the benefit of the doubt, glorified, nor defended. Instead, their transgressions are listed in “Trumpty Dumpty,” providing readers with a rare literary portrait of a deglamorized United States.
Contributing the most to the creation of this portrait is not the incorporation of descriptions, but instead the addition of cartoons. Due to the text’s short and succinct nature (it is roughly 54 pages), the illustrations append another layer of comedic element to the piece, which would otherwise be rather sparse. What is impressive about Lithgow’s line drawings is how well they complement the text. For instance, placed beside “Recipe for Disaster” — a poem about “the viral new cuisine, COVID-19” — is a graphic of a solemn-looking Trump cooking what looks to be eggs while donning a chef’s uniform. This is all set to the backdrop of a succession of doctors and nurses wearing PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). Other notable examples include Trump (wearing a USA hat) blowing COVID bacteria “bubbles” during a golf session; three politicians emerging from a toilet bowl; and — perhaps the most important one — a nude Trump, standing behind a group of police officers, staring into a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters carrying signs stating "I Can’t Breathe," "No Justice No Peace," "I am Not a Threat," and “Racism Kills."
Despite its length and the relatively simple drawings, Lithgow is detailed, so much so that Trump and many of his associates cannot escape from being placed under scrutiny. Readers are presented with a myriad of politicos including Mitch McConnell (“the Tortoise”), Roger Stone (“Rueful Roger”), and Jim Jordan (“Buckeye Firecracker”). The poems dedicated to them, as with many of the others included in “Trumpty Dumpty,” are mired with factual evidence.
That said, “Trumpty Dumpty” does not seek to inform and neither reveals new insights into the Trump administration nor proves any given statement is untrue. Instead, Lithgow transforms the obvious into a creative and magnificent world that readers can escape to at any given moment. As Nov. 3 approaches and the stress surrounding the uncertainty of the nation’s future mounts, “Trumpty Dumpty” distracts readers from the ridiculousness of America and lets them make use of their precious time by engaging with a funny and informative text.

In “All In: The Fight for Democracy,” filmmakers Liz Garbus and Lisa Cortes center on Stacey Abrams, the first Black woman to be a major party’s nominee for Georgia governor. Her battle and fraught election against Brian Kemp in Georgia’s 2018 gubernatorial election becomes the lens “All In” uses to study the history of voter discrimination in the United States. Garbus and Cortes collate personal accounts and shared memory to tell a sweeping story that at times falls short of its lofty goals.
The documentary features a range of experts who are introduced, effectively, in an opening montage, where they seem to break the fourth wall and talk directly to viewers. They are constants throughout the film, like a cast of characters. These speakers include leading political thinkers, such as Emory Professor of African American Studies Carol Anderson, journalist and author Ari Berman, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young Jr. “All In” uses these speakers to guide viewers through heavy historical material, but they also bring their own tones in delivery, which helps vivify each of their passionate perspectives on the film's themes.
The film covers a lot of ground, touching on key moments in voting history from the era of slavery in the U.S. to voter suppression today. “All In” is roughly split into different chapters to help viewers digest all this commentary. However, as expected with such complex subject matter, Garbus and Cortes struggle to clearly present and neatly contain their topics. This confusion is partially exacerbated by the film's use of transitions, which try to connect events through superimposition of images or word repetition, but none of these choices clearly signals the end of one segment and the beginning of another. For example, Abrams recounting her experience in advocacy at Spelman College is tenuously linked to a sequence around the women’s suffrage movement.
"All In" is also complicated by the sporadic use of various media, such as animation, comics, newspaper clippings, photos, and videos — both black and white and in color. The result is a barrage of tone, from the comedic cartoons to the serious footage of campaign speeches, which serves to overwhelm the viewer rather than inform them. This is evident in a scene of Florida Rights Restoration Coalition member Desmond Meade’s personal memoir that cuts to the infamous Ku Klux Klan film "The Birth of a Nation" to dramatic, but disorienting effect.
Despite these shortcomings, Garbus and Cortes speak directly with contemporary viewers. The film goes in depth into the disappointing results of the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court Case of 2013, which overturned part of the Voting Rights Act and allowed for the revival of racist tropes like required stricter forms of ID that disproportionately impact BIPOC. It finishes with the 2020 primaries and Black Lives Matter protests. The result is powerful: Viewers feel like they are part of a movement bigger than themselves, and bigger than their generation.
In the end, "All In" serves as a riveting last call to go to the polls. While it may be too ambitious in its attempt to cram centuries of history into a 100 minute film, it still succeeds in weaving a compelling tapestry of the struggle for minority voting rights. The result is a reminder that viewers need to respect the battles fought hundreds of years before them, and carry them forward.

John Manuel Arias is a Costa Rican poet and fiction writer based in Washington, D.C. His debut novel, “Where There Was Fire,” is forthcoming from Flatiron Books. The Harvard Crimson spoke to him about his writing process, his thematic and historical concerns, and the importance of Central American literature.
The Harvard Crimson: I’m curious how you think about your practice of fiction versus your practice of poetry. Are they separate or similar in your mind?
John Manuel Arias: So with me, my poetry is a little odd. I know people sort of write a poem, they work on it for like 9 months or they write it like 9 times over. Poetry for me is like regurgitating: it just comes out in one sort of heave. It's a little painful, equal to sort of watch[ing] it explode onto the page. Fiction for me is a lot slower, it's a lot more observatory and less conceptual. Although I do think my fiction is sort of conceptual, because I always come up with really super weird plots. With poetry, it's a lot more self-introspective, whereas with fiction I really get a chance to not only look at the exterior of the world, but also the interior of other people.
THC: Your poems have really great titles, such as “Self Portrait As Tear in Tympanic Membrane Poolside at the Hostel in Dominical”. How do titles come to you?
JMA: I got the idea of having fun with titles from my very good friend Aziza Barnes. [Their collection] “i be but i ain’t” is one of my staples in my poetry library, and they have really fantastic, long, sort of irreverent, but very piercing titles. And so, because my poetry is less fun to read, I try to have more fun with the titles.
THC: Do you have a different process for doing that in your short fiction, or your fiction just in titles?
JMA: I think they're a little bit more straightforward. With fiction, you really can't reel someone in with a very long, irreverent title. I had a story come out earlier this year in Barren Magazine called “For the Love of Dior” because in Spanish it's “por el amor de dios,” but instead of the Dios, it’s Dior. I also had a story called “Yurássic Park”, and because it's centered around the Costa Rican staff on the island, they wouldn't be pronouncing “J” as in English.
THC: You got interviewed by Bidwell Hollow in March, and you said that in your fiction you're really interested in history. I'm curious how you choose the history that you want to engage with. Is it something that you actively choose or do the historical topics come to you naturally?
JMA: It's a little bit of both. My degree, besides literature, is also Latin American studies, so I've been very history-centric. Duke University Press has been really incredible. Their Latin American studies section is wonderful and they've helped me a lot with research. I try to be as precise and as meaningful with my insertion of history. If I decide to put something on a date, I will look up what happened that day in history. I will look up the moon phase. In order for someone to live their life, even if it’s not incredibly pressing, history is influencing the way that they’re carrying on their day and their life. If the United States is causing a coup, then someone making some rice in the morning is going to be affected by that. The fiction is a way to explore both the exterior, the political, the historical, the natural, the cosmic, while also exploring the interior with not only the psychological and emotional, but also on the cellular level. I have a copy of Grey's Anatomy, and so [when writing fiction] I need to see what muscles are doing, I need to see what vessels are doing — they’re all influencing the way that we operate.
THC: What's most exciting to you about your new novel “Where There Was Fire”?
JMA: Goodness gracious me, well, bring your bananas! The history of Costa Rica, which I think is absolutely fascinating. It has been my focus for probably the last eight years; I lived in Costa Rica for 4 years. Costa Rica has a very ignored history internationally, but it's absolutely fascinating. Many people don't know that Costa Rica is the first Banana Republic. This very quote unquote peaceful country is the birthplace, unintentionally, of the most violent corporation that the western hemisphere has ever seen. It's a fascinating dichotomous place.
Also, I just get in the brains of a bunch of ghosts from my life. There's a lot of family history in the pages, which has been hella interesting. It’s predicted a few deaths and a hurricane, it's also read the past in a lot of ways that I've confirmed by other family members. It's been this weird crystal ball into both the past and the future, which has been very uncomfortable to write at times, but [I’ve been] really getting inside the heads of these people and sort of letting them lead me.
THC: There's a growing awareness of various queer and Latinx literatures in the U.S. literary world. What questions or gaps that you think exist in that discourse right now?
JMA: The huge gap will always be Central America. It's ignored on two uncomfortable levels, the first being obviously the American white mainstream: The white gullet that devours our work, and by our, I mean very broadly Latinx. And then also these Mexican, Chicanx, sort of hegemony that happens within not only the literature community, but also is pervasive throughout the United States.
I do believe that Central America needs much more focus and room. I feel like the American gullet loves warfare and loves civil war [narratives for Latin America]. To be clear, it's very important to Salvadorian, Guatemalan, and Nicaraguan people. But I think the American readership needs to calm their bloodlust a little, and not have violence be the center of a piece in order for it to be desired or readable. To have these narratives [of civil war] is natural and totally valid, but I want this very small circle to expand and allow people to explore other themes.
THC: How you have formed a community of queer and Latinx writers?
JMA: I love my Central American group chat. You just kiki with people! You talk politics, but sometimes you just like to talk s***. The natural chemistry and attraction is all of us being regular human beings, and then we are Central Americans, so we have a very specific lens through which we see everyone else and interact with everyone else. Yeah, that's more fun than anything.
Can I recommend some writers for you?
THC: Yes, of course!
JMA: Ricardo Alberto Maldonado's book “The Life Assignment” is an incredible work where there's an English version and [Spanish] language version; he is Puerto Rican and the poems are gorgeous and stunning. Also, Joy Priest’s “Horsepower.” I am always going back to Monica de la Torre’s new collection “Repetition Nineteen.” Whenever I need to feel like I can experiment with literally anything, I will go back to her. It has the freedom to absolutely blow my mind. And [make me think that] yes, I can also do that too; I give myself space to think outside of the box and break it.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wild West conventions abound: sweeping shots of a vast desert in the late-afternoon sunlight; the town sheriff having a drink in the local pub; an outsider walking in and the sheriff telling him, “I figure only one of us is walking out of here.” The camera lingers on the pistol in the leather holster during an almost-duel, the sheriff’s fingers hovering slightly over the trigger, and the lone wolf protagonist rallies the town against an outside threat.
These are the images that writer and director Jon Favreau reproduces in “The Mandalorian” Season Two premiere, “The Marshal.” Released on Oct. 30, the episode follows Din Djarin, the titular Mandalorian, as he continues his quest to reunite the Child (aka Baby Yoda) with its kind. Stylistically, “The Marshal” serves in part as an ode to Western film tradition. From the location (the desert planet of Tatooine) to the characters (the unnamed marshal of desert town Mos Pelgo and the stereotypically lone wolf Mandalorian), the season premiere pulls tropes and themes liberally from mid-century Western classics to create an intricate tapestry of “Star Wars” mainstays — like desert speed bikes and all manner of interesting animal species — and fresh, outside influences.
With the conventions of Western films as his backdrop, Favreau subtly draws parallels between cinematic cowboys and Mando, making his position as a lone ranger and outsider in Mos Pelgo especially palpable. At the same time, the similarities the episode has with Western cinema serve, too, to mark obvious differences. Despite being effectively solitary in his mission, the Mandalorian escapes the trap of becoming a one-dimensional John Wayne-type character. Instead, viewers see a Mando who is complex yet noble. He serves as the mediator between the warring groups of townspeople and the purportedly barbaric Tusken Raiders, all while treating both with respect. Favreau’s fidelity to Western tropes makes the Mandalorian’s divergence from the image of the macho cowboy all the more meaningful.
The episode, in classic Star Wars fashion, delves deep into themes of family and lineage. In the original Star Wars films, it’s Anakin Skywalker’s lack of a strong father figure that turns him toward the dark side and sets the Star Wars saga into motion. Fatherhood is central to the story, and Skywalker’s need to be a father to Luke is what eventually saves him. In “The Mandalorian,” this need is paralleled by Mando and the Child. The narrative — both in Season One and in “The Marshal” — is fully driven by the Mandalorian’s desire to help the Child.
Still, the relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child is far less prominent in this episode. While all of the Mandalorian’s own actions throughout the episode are rooted in his care for the Child, “The Marshal” still follows a very “side-quest” type of story when it comes to the grander trajectory of Mando’s mission. As he spends most of the episode uniting the people of Mos Pelgo and the Tusken Raiders in an epic fight to slay the krayt dragon, the Child falls to the wayside. Furthermore, rather than serve a purpose in the deadly fight — as he did on Tatooine in Season One when he used the force against a mudhorn — the Child here is used solely as a form of quick comic relief. For the nearly-hour-long episode, it does little more than make faces at the screen whenever there’s a moment of tension, which, albeit capitalizing on the cuteness of the Child, does little to forward the narrative.
While it was long, the episode’s commitment to getting a fresh look at the Star Wars universe — one that is just as rooted in shows of solidarity among different peoples (Tusken Raiders and Mos Pelgo townspeople) as it is in gunslinging action scenes — makes “The Mandalorian” a worthy watch for Star Wars diehards and more casual fans alike.
With the release of Episode IX and Season Seven of “The Clone Wars,” “The Mandalorian” is the only piece of new Star Wars content left. And yet, it is more unlike “Star Wars” than anything released in a while. Mando’s commitment to a singular journey and the show’s commitment to representing this goal in short, character-rich vignettes serves as a breath of fresh air in the Star Wars canon. In recent Star Wars films and offshoots, the stories seem to find their value in their connection to the grander Star Wars mythology, but in ”The Mandalorian,” the substance is in the episodic vignettes themselves.
In “Clone Wars,” each installment in the series would also follow one-off characters in random battles, but even then, the lore was always heavy, and it still felt very much like Star Wars. “The Mandalorian,” in contrast, just feels entirely like the day-to-day adventures of Mando. By rooting the story on him, a complex character with a strong background and a steadily growing character arc, “The Mandalorian” is able to exist without relying on the celebrity of the Star Wars universe as a crutch, while still engaging with the expansive themes and characters provided by the franchise. In this way, the show allows for the definition of Star Wars to move beyond campy dogfights and corny dialogue to something fresh and unique.

French artist-provocateur turned semi-professional chess player Marcel Duchamp once remarked that “while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists.” If the imaginative and perceptive protagonist of Netflix’s new seven-part miniseries “The Queen’s Gambit” is any indication, American writer, director, and producer Scott Frank and co-creator Allan Scott share Duchamp’s sentiments. Adapted from Walter Tevis’ 1983 bildungsroman of the same name, the show is not a treacly melodrama; instead, it is a reinvigorated variation of a sports narrative, the sport being chess and the athlete being fictional chess prodigy Beth Harmon (embodied by the exceptional Anya Taylor-Joy). Taylor-Joy is supported by a stellar cast whose refined performances and superb chemistry present a convincing look into the 1960s chess scene. Despite being centered around an occasionally dull game, “The Queen’s Gambit” is unfailingly thrilling, endearing, smart, and — somehow — a bit sexy.
When audiences first meet Beth, however, her life is void of allure. She begins her story in the late 1950s as a nine-year-old Kentucky orphan who is exposed to the intricacies of chess through her orphanage’s custodian (Bill Camp). Quickly, but not surprisingly, her prowess as a chess player increases, eventually allowing her to join the international chess circuit as a teenager. She is accompanied by her alcoholic adoptive mother Mrs. Wheatley (Marielle Heller), who is entranced by the profitability of her daughter’s natural talent and the prospect of replacing her lonely life in suburbia for one of luxury.
It is through Beth’s effortless global defeats of men twice her age that her prestige and celebrity grow, in some cases garnering attention and fondness from her challengers. What her admirers and male interests aren’t aware of is that as she fights against seasoned cognoscenti for world chess domination, she battles another opponent in private: addiction to the tranquilizers her orphanage used to dispense to the kids.
But “The Queen’s Gambit” is not a tragic tale about addiction and overcoming adversity. Although Frank’s rich teleplay examines Beth, her birth mother, and Mrs. Wheatley’s substance abuse issues as well as the former’s extreme preoccupation with chess, the series is by no means drab or somber. Of course, there are periods of vulnerability, doubt, and desolation. Beth struggling to reconcile herself to the deaths of those closest to her is a heartbreaking image to behold. But Frank’s expert interpretation of the source material presents audiences with a balanced portrait of Beth’s complicated life — he includes moments of levity between Beth and her chess acquaintances; illustrates explorations of intimacy and sexual identity; and provides insight into successful and failed relationships, both familial and nonfamilial. “The Queen’s Gambit” explores every path in Beth’s narrative trajectory, and the complexities that layer upon one another as the series progresses make for a tremendously electrifying viewing experience.
In fact, the power of the show lies in Frank’s ability to build characters who are dynamic, organic, and raw. No character, perhaps with the exception of Beth’s training partner and former competitor Benny Watts (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), is completely likable and flawless. Beth, in particular, is initially unfriendly, quiet, and difficult to engage with. Over the course of seven episodes, though, Beth changes, challenging audience members’ preconceptions and predictions. This is precisely what makes the show so captivating. Frank replaces consistent and static characters with those who have story arcs that are elaborate and unexpected. Better yet, almost no role is overlooked, ensuring that Beth’s voice is not the only one amplified.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about every character. At times, “The Queen’s Gambit” falls short, especially in relation to race and gender. While Frank does not center race and gender in the series, he moves a pawn to another square but fails to execute the play well. The series hints at the respective significance of race and gender but merely through superfluous dialogue. Take, for example, Beth’s Black childhood friend Jolene, who points out that she won’t be adopted because she’s Black, or Beth — who appears unfazed by the rampant sexism in the chess community — never explicity attributing the discrimination she faces to her gender. In both cases, no further examination or response is made. If “The Queen’s Gambit” wanted to depict strong, well-rounded roles, then the teleplay would have benefited from additional social commentary by Beth and Jolene.
Still, in spite of its missteps in critically discussing race and gender, “The Queen’s Gambit” is largely rewarding. Although the show may have managed better with quicker pacing and fewer episodes and drawn-out storylines, its tonality and visual language is so stunning that the extra hours are a gift. The effect of Beth’s tale is nuanced by elements of the production such as the pensive and eerie score, which soars in the right places, effectively raising the stakes in turbulent chess sequences by subtly hinting at the competitor’s interior tactics as they attack and retreat.
Building on the precision of the orchestration are the impressive visual effects and costume designs. Recurring segments of Beth imagining moving oversized chess pieces on the ceiling are breathtakingly translated for the screen. Similar attention to detail is directed toward the hair, wig, makeup, and costume design, which not only transports audiences to the 1960s, but also transforms according to the character’s distinctive developmental arcs. Namely, the silhouette, texture, and color palette of Beth’s rich outfits metamorphose as the show progresses, offsetting the muted cinematic look and making for a mesmerizing visual treat. From Beth’s iconic coiffed hair and Benny Watts’ Western style to floating pawns, “The Queen's Gambit” never misses a play in terms of production design.
Shockingly, what is most enthralling about “The Queen’s Gambit” are the chess scenes, which are not only beautifully and engrossingly shot, but also gripping. Several are sad, while others are amusing and in rare instances, sensual. What links each scene together is the essence it conveys: Beth is the artist and the chess board is her canvas. Just as she is drawn into the world of chess time and time again, “The Queen’s Gambit” draws the viewer into Beth’s world through the exhilarating maneuvers of the game.

Ten years after graduating from Harvard College, Damien S. Chazelle ’07 made history as the youngest recipient of the Academy Award for Best Director for “La La Land.” Outside of his work building an extensive filmography, which includes “Whiplash” and “First Man,” Chazelle is currently involved in the ALL IN Voters Campus Democracy Challenge. On Oct. 30, Chazelle spoke to Harvard College students through the Harvard Votes Challenge about civic engagement, film, and his time as a Harvard student himself.
Days away from what is arguably the most consequential presidential election of our lifetime, Chazelle began by addressing the urgent and timely topic of empowering others to exercise their democratic freedom. “There are pretty compelling statistics that show how much more effective friend-to-friend, acquaintance-to-acquaintance, and family-to-family recommendations to vote are, than ‘the stranger knocking on your door,’” Chazelle said.
He emphasized that engaging one’s existing social circle to encourage political participation has never been more necessary than in the age of COVID. “In the past, my wife and I had done stuff door-to-door," he said. "That was not on the table this time round, so it opened me up to other ways to get the vote out. And as much as I like to complain about cell phones and social media — using that as a way to network is especially effective amongst young people.”
Reflecting on the state of political participation in his youth, he said, “When I was in high school and college, apathy was the cool thing. Exhibiting overt political engagement just wasn’t.” Through his current work with voter participation initiatives, he describes today’s much-improved state of political awareness amongst youth as “extremely heartening” and said that he sees "way more enthusiasm."
But Chazelle still sees room for improvement. “Historically, this country hasn’t been that great at making voting feel like the easiest, most accessible thing you can do," he said.
He urged students to adopt a comprehensive approach to voting, paying attention to not just one or two races, but even the local ones. His message is clear and simple: Every vote matters, and one must “widen their aperture on what voting can be.”
One of the organizers of the Harvard Votes Challenge, Kevin Ballen ’22 enforced Chazelle's comments. “From what Damien said about himself and the entertainment industry and what we heard from our attendees, this election has awoken something in all of us," Ballen said. "The impact of electoral politics at all levels of government has never been more clear. And the potential for the 22 million college students to influence the future of our country is even clearer.”
After the discussion, Chazelle took questions from the audience regarding his creative career both during and after Harvard. On campus, Chazelle concentrated in Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) –– now offered as Art, Film and Visual Studies (AFVS) — lived in Currier House, and played in an indie band (Chester French).
When asked about his first film, “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench," he revealed that the black-and-white romantic musical film set in Boston had evolved from a short for his VES thesis. “Students, at least when I was there, could apply for a Harvard research grant that was given out every semester, and there was also an additional artist fellowship grant for theses that were in the arts,” he said. “I couldn’t really hire crew; the actors who were in it were really just working for free. I was able to pay them little honorariums in case they had to take time off from work, but it was essentially just a few actors, some fellow VES students and myself using the camera from the college.”
Chazelle’s commitment to film “cannibalized his time” to such an extent that he took a semester off to focus on it and ended up never going back to Harvard. He later chose to apply retroactively for Advanced Standing to graduate.
By the time he finished editing "Guy and Madeline" on his computer, he had packed his bags and moved to Los Angeles. “Actually, I had this kind of deluded sense that like, ‘Oh, I’ve done a feature, now my next step’s going to be the studios!’ And it didn’t really work that way," he said. "There were some critics who saw ("Guy and Madeline") and really liked it, but agents and Hollywood folk would kind of go, ‘What the hell is this?’”
Chazelle made a name for himself in Hollywood, primarily by developing and sharing his talent as a screenwriter. “Writing’s the one thing I could do for free,” he said. “I just mainly locked myself in my room, and just wrote, and wrote, and wrote… One bad script after another until there was a good one.”
Chazelle acknowledged the role that Harvard’s VES department played in his development as an artist. “It’s thanks to those professors and the equipment room there that I was able to do it at all," he said.
Audience members said they found Chazelle’s humility both refreshing and inspiring. “Key takeaways for me included the importance of honing one’s craft in solitude, and that making one’s first feature film is very doable, even with limited resources,” Nicolas V. Medrano ’22 said. “As I plan on making my first narrative feature soon, it’s quite motivating knowing that a fellow Harvard film student has done it before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For centuries, politicians have sowed distrust as a tactic for disarming, subverting, and dividing. In the historical drama “Good Night, and Good Luck” (2005), American writer, director, and actor George Clooney deftly explores the tension between patriotism and treason — between baseless fears and informational integrity — that defined the Red Scare when Senator Joseph R. McCarthy accused hundreds of Americans of sympathizing with the Communist party. Clooney’s film, which follows the gripping conflict between McCarthy and a CBS News team led by shrewd journalist Edward “Ed” R. Murrow (David Strathairn), is apt commentary preceding the momentous 2020 presidential election.
“Good Night, and Good Luck” opens with a banquet hosted by the Radio-Television News Directors Association and Foundation, where Murrow has been invited to speak. In his characteristically prudent, austere tone, Murrow admonishes, “We are currently wealthy, fat, comfortable, and complacent. We have a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information. Our mass media reflects this.” His words are interspersed with shots of the banquet’s elegantly dressed attendees, a stark juxtaposition to the sobering gravity of his words.
The film then transitions to October of 1953. Murrow and his news team, which includes friend and producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney), stumble upon a story from Dexter, Mich.: The Air Force chose to discharge lieutenant Milo Radulovich because his father was accused of Communist ties. Though Murrow and Friendly plan to run a story on the baseless accusations, CBS News director Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) strongly dissents, citing that many of the show’s sponsors possess military contacts. Irate, he demands, “Do you understand the position you’re putting us in?” Mickelson’s adamance underscores the prioritization of finances over the integrity of political information, a central theme that crescendos as the film progresses.
The most exhilarating aspect of "Good Night, and Good Luck" is that it is filmed as though in real-time. The frantic, disjointed shots of journalists smoking cigarettes, secretaries rushing over to pick up ringing telephones, and broody executives reclining in the newsroom simulate the propulsive spontaneity that individuals must have felt as they raced against the clock, eager to illuminate McCarthy's groundless political movement.
In stark contrast to the film’s suspenseful sequences, moments of understated vulnerability provide a change of pace that draws viewers more intimately into the granular details of journalistic life. Seconds before going live to contest the lack of due process in allegations against Milo Radulovich, a normally unflappable Murrow turns to Friendly and confides, “You know, it occurs to me that we might not get away with this one.”
As the political clash between Murrow’s team and McCarthy escalates, Clooney incorporates real clips of the Wisconsin senator, lending the film a sense of historical immediacy. The genius of Murrow’s political maneuvering is that he does not insert his own words into the picture. Rather, he uses McCarthy’s own arguments against him. Unlike the rest of the nation, which clings to the vagaries of McCarthy’s accusations, Murrow forces the senator’s meandering rhetoric to a standstill, interrogating the validity of each word.
At the conclusion of the film, viewers are lifted from the tense political uncertainty of 1953 back to the opening banquet scene. Murrow stands in the limelight, his austere features etched with urgency and concern. He reflects on the capacity of television, back then a fairly new technology, to either subdue or empower: “This instrument,” he says, “can teach. It can illuminate, and yes, it can even inspire. But it can only do so to the extent that humans are determined to use it toward those ends. Otherwise, it is merely wires and lights in a box.”
Murrow’s reservations about the misuse of technology rings uncannily true in today’s era of informational distortion. The film ends with Murrow's iconic salute, “Good night, and good luck.” Despite the recurrence of the iconic phrase, Clooney never clarifies its meaning. As Murrow underscores to his audience at the banquet that bookends the film, the onus to demand truth from political turmoil ultimately rests on citizens themselves. Perhaps “good luck” is a nod to this dual responsibility and privilege that individuals possess to demand more from the systems and institutions that surround them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quite reasonably, one might be drawn to calling “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” satirical — but satire thrives on ruthless scrutiny of a phenomenon, dramatizing that observation to such an absurd conclusion that onlookers end up saying “oh yeah, this is actually kind of messed up.” Following this train of logic, the film, released on Amazon Prime Video on Oct. 23, is not really satire at all, but a devastating and raunchy exposé of various American personalities that coastal liberals try to forget about. Terrifyingly, it’s a real-life Stanford prison experiment: Sacha Baron Cohen — producer, writer, and lead actor — shows us over and over again that people will go along with atrocities rather than question them and risk making anyone uncomfortable.
As in the 2006 original, Borat travels around the United States in unscripted skits, meeting Americans who genuinely believe he is a foreigner with no understanding of how the country actually works. In this release, Borat has been disgraced and is sentenced to death in Kazakhstan — unless he can deliver a pornographic monkey to Vice President Mike Pence as a reconciliation gift. Things go awry when he opens the monkey crate and finds his disheveled daughter, Tutar (Maria Bakalova) instead. Change of plans: She's the gift now (to Borat, women are not people). Preparations include attending a Texan debutante ball, scheduling $21,000 worth of plastic surgery, and seeking advice from a sugar baby. You know, all the prerequisites to womanhood.
SNL has had trouble satirizing the never-ending string of horrors stemming from decisions in the Trump White House, and Baron Cohen encounters the same problem in this sequel. With the exception of Borat’s misogyny, which slowly dissipates as the film goes on, the other moments throughout the film simply must be observed without much commentary: They are so ridiculous (in a bad way) that there isn’t much more to say.
Baron Cohen shows how ugly parts of this country can be. Examples include the man who doesn’t bat an eyelash when Borat buys a cage for Tutar (implying how lucky she is, unlike the children separated from their parents at the border by the current administration, to be its sole inhabitant) and the woman who more-than-willingly writes an anti-Semitic message on a cake for Borat. There’s also the woman who laughs when Borat asks for Tutar’s dress to scream “no means yes” and the woman at the tanning salon who recommends a skin tone “acceptable” to a racist family — Borat prompts her to say this, but it’s striking that she doesn’t even think twice before answering him in the way he expects to be answered.
Then there’s the pastor more concerned with his crusade against abortion than Borat’s admission of incest (“God doesn’t create mistakes,” apparently) and the two men who take Borat in once COVID hits — both of whom think liberals are worse than the virus (which is a conspiracy theory, of course!) but who spout their own conspiracies without any acknowledgement of their cognitive dissonance.
Throughout it all, Borat’s and Tutar’s racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism serve as the basis for the bonds between them and the various fringe characters who say bigoted things without even blinking. Herein lies Baron Cohen’s point: People are much, much likelier to feel comfortable displaying their own bigotry to someone who has already revealed their own. What’s shocking is not the unmasked opinions, but how easily they’re shown to the viewer. Borat is able to run through the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) wearing KKK garb, and none of the people at the conference stop him. (The Republican Party isn’t officially affiliated with the KKK, but what’s on the screen speaks volumes.)
This sequel is far more politically charged than its predecessor — viewers expecting more of the same will likely be disappointed. Above all, it’s a commentary on truth: People will create their own truth even in the face of contradictory facts. We see Mike Pence say that COVID isn’t a problem to a crowd of adoring fans; we see people attend an anti-mask rally at the end of June when nationwide deaths had already cleared six digits. What else can really be said?
The irony of how these fringe, xenophobic characters embrace Borat, a foreigner, isn’t lost either. As long as Borat conforms to some ol’ fashioned bigotry, he is readily accepted.
Another interesting take in “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” is its discussion of misogyny. Indeed, it’s the only form of discrimination that approaches any kind of satirization. Borat, a father, receives a manual from the government on how to raise daughters; one particularly “touching” story forbids female masturbation, which scares Tutar so much that she is afraid she will die if she attempts to do it.
The only person who cuts through Borat’s many -isms is Tutar’s babysitter, Jeanise Jones (a mask-wearer and social-distancing adherent!), who tells her that any man should like her as she is and teaches her that, yes indeed, masturbation will not lead to death. That, along with the absurdity of forbidding women to drive, the metaphor of golden cages, and the ridiculousness of foisting plastic surgery upon a 15 year old all show the extent to which female existence is contingent on repackaging the self and crafting palatability to an observer.
Borat shows character development by the end while America does not. It’s been said that the way to change people’s minds is to engage in personal conversations. Borat shows that this is true to some extent, but his conversion from a father who tells Tutar that women can’t ask questions into a “feminist” reporter teaming up with his own daughter on live television also shows that unfortunately, people often have to realize that their personal lives will be harmed if they don’t change their beliefs. As Upton Sinclair said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” It is more expedient to espout a variety of -isms if doing so upholds some aspect of one’s identity, no matter how vile the opinion.
Borat tells us in the last five minutes of the film that the greatest threat to Kazakhstan is, in fact, the Yankee — and his statement is amusing, but it also belies a stronger, unmissable message if you’ve watched the entire film up to that point. The enemy is us.
Accordingly, the credits say: Go vote.

With “Who Made the Sunshine,” his third project of 2020, Griselda Records president and founder Westside Gunn continues his hot streak with the same attitude and vintage beats that have come to define the Buffalo label’s sound. Familiar but effective, the album is another successful application of the throwback Griselda format that, aided by an all-star guestlist, strengthens Gunn’s chokehold on the rap game.
Despite a relentless release pace, Gunn and the rest of Griselda Records continue to maintain a consistency unmatched in the current hip-hop landscape. Led by Gunn, Griselda is reviving classic ’90s New York hip-hop, spitting unfiltered drug rap over gaudy instrumentals. First gaining major mainstream attention with Gunn’s 2016 mixtape “Flygod,” the Buffalo label has garnered co-signs from Jay-Z, Eminem, 50 Cent, and the Wu-Tang Clan. Griselda signed a licensing deal with Eminem’s Shady records in 2017 and finalized a contract with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation last year. “Who Made the Sunshine” is Gunn’s first major label release, published by Shady Records, and the seventh project from a Griselda-affiliate this year.
Like the rest of the Griselda catalogue, the album recalls vintage New York rap with a focus on witty lyrics and delivery. Supported by in-house production from Daringer and Beat Butcha, the album is packed with slow-roll beats that highlight verses from Gunn and his guest artists. The solo track “Big Basha’s” showcases Gunn’s typical lyrical extravagance: “Glock next to my nuts, Balenciagas oversize,” he raps over a creeping melodic loop. On “98 Sabers” Gunn trades back to back verses with Griselda rappers Conway the Machine, Benny the Butcher, and recent signee Armani Caesar. He boasts of the group’s lyrical consistency and recent run of projects: “Move like Chef Dred in the kitchen / You’d rather be dead than go against us.” Other posse tracks like “The Butcher and the Blade” evoke a similar group energy to the Wu-Tang team-ups on solo albums from Raekwon, GZA, and Ghostface Killah.
It may be Gunn’s album, but the project’s best verses come from the all-star lineup of guest artists. Similar to Kanye West and Travis Scott, Gunn’s ability to curate a guest list is one of his strongest talents. Appearances from past collaborators Black Thought, Jadakiss, and Busta Rhymes prove that rap’s last generation can still compete with the new school. The most interesting and perhaps least relevant name on the guestlist is Golden Age hip-hop pioneer Slick Rick, known for the 1988 hit “Children’s Story.” Yet, on “Ocean Prime,” Rick holds his own with Busta Rhymes and on “Good Night,” Rick completely steals the show with his effortless delivery. The eight-minute cypher “Frank Murphy” is a lyrical slug fest with each guest at their absolute best. The track hosts five Griselda affiliates from New York and the Northeast including Harlem MC Smoke DZA and Lynn, MA rapper Estee Nack. DZA goes second to last: “The FLYGOD sent the smoke signal and I appeared out the pound.” Verse for verse, it’s a better track than any XXL Freshman cover cypher from the past few years.
Compared with such high quality bars, the beats are much less memorable. A majority of the production credits belong to Daringer and Beat Butcha, who seemed to have found the outer limit of their no-sample production method. Most of the loops and drums on the tracklist are simply remixes of beats from Gunn’s earlier projects. “The Butcher and the Blade” has the same tempo and drum kicks as “George Bondo” off of Gunn’s May release “Pray for Paris,” just with a different loop over the top. And “Ishkabibble's” mirrors “Dr. Birds” on the Griselda group album “WWCD” released last year. The choice to rely so heavily on Daringer and Beat Butcha feels limiting, considering that his previous projects have had a more diverse range of collaborators. Even though the producer lineup on Gunn’s new album is narrower, the collaboration with veteran beatmakers is still successful. “All Praises” is produced by longtime Griselda collaborator and Mobb Deep affiliate The Alchemist and is the most layered and melodic beat on the album. And, “98 Sabers” showcases flashy production from Jay-Z go-to producer Just Blaze that sends the project out on a bang.
Ultimately, “Who Made the Sunshine” is another medal on the neck of Gunn and Griselda. What takes other labels and rappers years to accomplish — three solid albums — Gunn has done in a matter of months. His unparalleled work ethic has flipped the rap landscape on its head, putting pressure on the competition. With a rumored fourth project of the year in the works and an upcoming release from Benny the Butcher and Hit-Boy on the way, Gunn has solidified 2020 as the year of Griselda.

On “Burden of Proof,” Benny The Butcher teams up with multi-platinum producer Hit-Boy to take the Griselda Records format mainstream while staying true to his Buffalo roots. Featuring a completely revamped sound, the album solidifies Benny as a lyrical force, lining up his career for bigger things to come.
Although the album is his first solo project this year, Benny has had a blockbuster 2020. In July, he debuted a group album from his own label, Black Soprano Family, with help from DJ Drama and eOne Entertainment. Throughout the summer, he featured prominently on Griselda projects from Armani Caesar, Conway the Machine, and Westside Gunn. Benny also garnered guest spots on new albums from underground rap heroes The Lox and Freddie Gibbs, as well as industry titans T.I. and Lil Wayne. Even Drake tapped Benny for a collab, which has yet to be released.
Perhaps signaling a new era for the Buffalo rapper, “Burden of Proof” is entirely produced by chart-topping beatmaker Hit-Boy. Hit-Boy’s production captures the essence of Benny’s throwback sound and successfully updates it for mainstream appeal. Possessing a chameleon-like ability to change production style, Hit-Boy gave similar treatment to recent albums from Big Sean and Nas. The track “War Paint,” which features Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine, has a creep and slow roll reminiscent of beats from Griselda in-house producer Daringer and long time Benny collaborator The Alchemist. Tracks featuring Gunn, Conway, and Benny, have become a staple of Griselda Records projects, with at least one such song appearing on every release from the label. The addition of Hit-Boy to the Griselda universe elevates Benny’s sound to new heights.
While incorporating the boom-bap style of Griselda, Hit-Boy ditches the grimey loops used by Alchemist and Daringer in favor of polished melodic sampling. On “Where Would I Go” and “One Way Flight,” the vocal samples are crisp and lively, a departure from the downtempo brooding of the beats on Benny’s last project “The Plugs I Met.” On the last track of his new album, “Legend,” Hit-Boy achieves an up-tempo swing that is evocative of the early hits of Jay-Z, who has voiced his approval of Benny on multiple occasions, signing him to a management deal with Roc Nation in 2019. In fact, “Timeless,” the sixth track on “Burden of Proof,” was a beat that Hit-Boy originally produced for Jay-Z and Kanye West’s 2011 team up project “Watch the Throne.” Connection to Jay-Z aside, Benny’s revamped sound is readily accessible and is sure to attract new fans.
Despite the pivot in production style, Benny’s lyricism is as familiar and powerful as ever. He manages to out-rap each of his heavyweight features including Lil Wayne, Big Sean, and Rick Ross. Over the past couple years, Benny and Griselda have steadily risen to dominate the conversation in the hip-hop community, bringing about a resurgence of ’90s New York rap. On the album title track, Benny reflects on his ascendancy: “Yo, last year was ’bout brandin’, this year about expandin.’” Besides his business ties with Roc Nation and Griselda, Benny maintains his status as an independent artist. With financial freedom and control of his creative agenda, on “Legend,” Benny raps about the immense potential that his future holds: “They say I’m the next so and so.”
In addition to owning his success, “Burden of Proof” sees Benny open up about his past. The mix between deep reflection and unapologetic confidence showcases his maturity as a writer. On “Trade it All,” Benny talks about the rappers that inspired him as a young man in Buffalo: “I’m a product of the block I lived the Pacs, Nas’, and B.I.Gs.” He also addresses the tragedy in his life. On “Thank God I Made It,” Benny speaks about his brother, MachineGun Black, who was murdered in 2006: “I look in my nephew eyes and I see my brother / Sometimes I gotta look away ’cause it hurt so much.” Earlier this year, Benny’s long time manager and producer, DJ Shay, died after contracting COVID-19. At the end of “Famous,” he pays tribute to his mentor and his late brother: “Rest in Peace DJ Shay and MachineGun Black.” On each verse, his matter of fact delivery heightens the emotional content of his words.
With Benny’s stirring lyricism and expertly tailored production from Hit-Boy, Benny continues the Griselda Records hot streak and levels up his own solo career. The first full length follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2018 album Tana Talk 3, “Burden of Proof” is the crowning achievement in Benny’s catalogue. Recently earning the respect of celebrities like Virgil Abloh and Lebron James, Benny is ready to go big time. The album has the potential to considerably widen his fanbase. Still arguably at the beginning of his career, Benny continues to surpass all expectations. It’s only up from here for the Butcher.

The cover of “Nectar,” the latest album from YouTuber-turned-musician George Kusunoki Miller, features a candid, Rembrandt-esque profile photo of the artist with half of his face covered in a dark hue and the rest in a tinted red. Known by his stage name of Joji, Miller released his sophomore studio album on Sept. 25 via 88rising.
The intro song of the album is titled “Ew,” leading with the reoccurring melancholy of an isolated piano solo. This is well-blended into approaching instrumentals until Joji’s voice seems to appear at the horizon, singing of heartbreak and solitude. “Teach me to love just to let me go, he laments, “I can’t believe that I’m not enough.” These lines allude the overarching theme of the album — lost love and questioning one’s self worth.
The album progresses to more catchy soundbites, starting from its second song, “MODUS.” Playful lyricism is highlighted with rhyme schemes such as “I’ll take a peek to across the peaks / This grass is neat and I’m quite unique.” The theme of insecurity from “Ew” is furthered when Joji sings, “I’m not strong enough for you,” and, “I wanna be a Chevy, not a Sentra,” (a Chevy being a stronger car). The song then descends into chaos with a repetitiveness and prickliness, as if Joji is trying to convince himself that he is good enough: “I feel good, I feel good, I feel good (I fixed it).”
“Tick Tock” follows as the album begins to immerse into a lo-fi atmosphere, backed by more bouncy, relaxed instrumentation. Against that monotonous sound, Joji sings of wasting time under the guise of still being in love. The track is followed by “Daylight,” the first collaboration song on the album, featuring the DJ Diplo. This is where the album begins to fall apart, and it becomes clear that some songs function more like fillers to add variety. The conspicuous intention for these collaborations expands over the rest of the album, where Joji’s vulnerability in other solo tracks feels less valuable to the listener because of these collaborations.
An astounding gem in this album was released before “Nectar” — the single, “Gimme Love.” In “Upgrade,” the preceding track, Joji sings of love as “optional.” The lyrics in “Gimme Love” seem to directly contradict this, asking for love in a more demanding and urgent manner. Beyond this contradiction, the track begins to stand out at its midpoint; in contrast to many others on the album, “Gimme Love” is divided into two distinct halves. A frantic “gimme love” suddenly turns into a chiming, harp-like atmosphere, a sharp contrast from the heavier beats in the prior half. Joji then sings, “When I’m far too gone, can you show me love? / Give me love,” and, “Everyone’s looking for someone to hold / But I can’t let you go.” This raw, quieter section is heartbreaking, and the division of the song into halves paints a maturing of sorts, one from a childish, “gimme,” to a more communicative, “give me.” Written now in full sentences, his yearning for love and sympathy becomes, suddenly, sincere.
The rest of the album is more collaboration-heavy. Though adding variety, the lineup of features skews the listener away from Joji’s otherwise uninhibited and honest lyrics, making some parts of the album more shallow than others. An example is the track, “Pretty Boy,” featuring Lil Yachty. The track seems to backtrack from the honesty and open communication Joji established earlier in the album, as he now sings, “Livin’ so loud, you could never hear me cry, nay-ay / See no tears run down my eyes,” and, “All this pain I’ll never let show (No) / My real thoughts, you’ll never know (No).”
Joji’s “Nectar” is not without its moments of creative sincerity; the theme of mourning love comes through and is universally felt. However, bogged down by collaborations and repetitive instrumentals, the album falls short of the artist’s full potential. The background synths quickly begin to feel formulaic, and apart from a few gems, like the experimental “Gimme Love” or “Reanimator” starring a more experimental and virtuosic style, the album too easily becomes background noise.

Is it really possible to do anything new in music anymore?
It is easy to grow cynical of the tireless machine that is the contemporary music industry. Some call its sonic output plastic, others blame plastic production for housing anything but genuine intention. Critics bemoan a culture that celebrates commercial success over creative fulfillment.
From the fog of today’s music emerges a welcome hand. It is a strange hand, no doubt, but a sure one. Unlike its contemporaries, Gorillaz extends an artistic limb that is older than its younger counterparts yet retains an enigmatic freshness. The band’s unapologetically raw sound and uncompromisingly vulnerable lyrics are diamonds in a sea of dust. Gorillaz’s artistic luminescence is bright enough to convince you they are the new newness, the only assured newness in a modern musical scene that seems to be unsure of what it wants to be.
Their endearingly eclectic discography, from sensational single “Feel Good Inc.” (2005) to the sonically arresting album “Humanz” (2017) proves time and time again Gorillaz does not exist to emulate, nor do they create sound to please. “Song Machine” — the group’s latest project — is no exception.
Despite their technically fascinating composition, what truly makes Gorillaz stand out is their ability to leverage technical creativity as a vehicle for dynamic sound. Thanks to the diversity of featured artists on any given Gorillaz discography, the band boasts a sonic palette that is constantly in flux, providing a rare opportunity to make each song unique, even irreplaceable.
British sensation Gorillaz was formed in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and illustrator Jamie Hewlett. One of the world’s most popular virtual bands, Gorillaz is composed of a cast of characters that are not corporeal artists, but rather animated individuals. Though membership remains fluid, the four signature characters are Stuart “2-D” Pot, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. In addition to releasing music, Gorillaz is also known for releasing dazzlingly-animated music videos, interviews, and cartoons.
Gorillaz boasts a long list of trophies and titles, including a Grammy for Pop Collaboration with Vocals (“Feel Good Inc.,” 2005), over 20 million record sales, and Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards. What makes them truly stand out, however, is their refusal to emulate conventional legacies of success in the music industry.
Whether it be the completely virtual nature of their band or their postmodern musicality, Gorillaz challenges its listeners to question what meaningful sound is.
By making the radical creative choice to dress down, not up, Gorillaz achieves a subliminally self-assured, wondrously expansive tone. Interlaced between lazy voices and dreamy sonic landscapes dwells an easy honesty that shines through both sonically and lyrically. Paired with melancholic piano chords and a crooning harmonica, the aching verses to “The Pink Phantom” are poems in their own right:
“You’ve more or less forgotten me this summer,” 2-D croons. “Try to tell you that I love you but I’m choked up,” featured rapper 6LACK confides. “In a sky made of diamonds,” Elton John serenades, “And where the world is flawless / I’ll be waiting for you on the other side.”
This complicated emotionality presents a radical shift from much of contemporary music’s binaristic interpretation of feeling. Some songs submerge themselves wholly in bombastic self-love, an affinity so unidirectional it risks sounding self-absorbed. Other Gen-Z and millennial acts have grown comfortable with a heady sense of melancholia, frequently penning lyrics that are hugely pessimistic, almost carelessly so.
“Song Machine” presents a rare opportunity to sink into a wholly different experience. Rather than subscribe to one avenue of emotion, Gorillaz delightfully careens through diverse boulevards of sentiment. Even in their album’s most melancholic moments, the virtual band manages to cultivate a startling luminescence, a bittersweet euphoria that wells through the sonic cracks of their album.
Perhaps the most notable challenge of “Song Machine” is its waffling between superficial and sustainable fulfillment. This exploration is particularly visible in “Momentary Bliss.” “We could do so much better than this,” Isaac Holman, member of English punk rock duo Slaves, sings. “Mausoleum faces and momentarily bliss / We can do so much better than this.” British rapper Slowthai adds, “It makes me sick to think you ain’t happy in your own skin.” 2-D follows, singing wistfully, “Oh, you need to change your face / You’re gettin’ sold, you’re such a waste / Oh, we could do so much better than this / Swimmin’ in pools of momentary bliss.”
Though “Momentary Bliss” holds infinite interpretations, what is universal is its overwhelming resonance with many, if not all, human experiences. Faux happiness and plastic fulfilment are common phenomena that Gorillaz work to undress in their latest musical installment. In doing so, the virtual band paints a sonic landscape of lucid epiphany.
If anything is in demand during these strange contemporary times, it is creative respite. Listeners are granted the rare privilege of placing their weary minds against the magnificently novel, complex shoulder of “Song Machine” and letting out a sigh of something in between bliss and relief.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nothing gets you in your feelings quite like the right R&B record. The past decade gave way to many such gems, with few albums more memorable than Grammy-nominated Bryson Tiller’s “Trapsoul.” His culture-resetting debut quickly became synonymous with the trapsoul movement, with the quadruple platinum Billboard-worthy single “Don’t,” closely followed by the instant hit “Exchange,” standing out as pivotal catalysts to Tiller’s career.
The Louisville artist went on to cement his rise to fame in his 2017 “True to Self” album tour alongside fellow new R&B icon SZA. More recently, he returned to his origins with a “special edition of his debut album, “Trapsoul” — featuring some B-sides and two new tracks including the SoundCloud demo “Rambo (Last Blood)” in collaboration with The Weeknd.
The bar has been set high for Tiller ever since, but few knew what tricks the reclusive artist had up his sleeve.
Many speculated about his new release; some guessed it was another set of B-side tracks, while others expected a meditation on the artist’s personal life. Regardless of how it would be being conveyed, however, a consensus remained: that mid-2010’s feeling of being in their bag, a memento so commonly attributed to the trapsoul genre and Tiller himself — listeners wanted that feeling back.
At first glance, Tiller's new album “Anniversary” seems to do just that.
Intentionally reminiscent of “Trapsoul” both in its album art and slated release date (the literal “anniversary” of “Trapsoul”’s original release), the album seems to be a continuation of its successful older sibling, just with a more refined sound. Many fans wondered: Would it be merely another echo of the “Trapsoul” legacy, or exceed those high-set expectations?
The verdict’s out, and it’s none of the above. “Anniversary” is more of a ghost in “Trapsoul”’s shell than a deliberate echo, neither moving past previous styles nor striving to maintain them. The result is a record constantly caught in the limbo of aimlessly trying out new sounds and falling back into the reverberations of its past.
There exists a clear-cut dichotomy between the two kinds of tracks on “Anniversary.” On the one hand, songs like “Things Change” and “Timeless Interlude” employ the same vocal range and audio-backing of “Trapsoul”’s “Let Em’ Know” and “Exchange,” constantly switching up the flow from raw vocals to straight bars. “Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah,” Tiller lamented in 2015, revisiting the conversation five years later with: “No, I never go too deep … It's a evident relapse.” This trademark self-reflection bleeds flawlessly into the lo-fi beats of “Always Forever” and “Next to You,” where more of Tiller’s refined yet unfalteringly authentic mellow melodies shine. “Loving you is intoxicating,” Tiller harmonizes, an epitome of that intimate, bittersweet lyricism Tiller is known to execute so perfectly.
A conflict arises, however, when these vocal-centered numbers clash with the new sounds Tiller experiments with on “Anniversary.” Samples of radio clips and more experimental vocal effects on tracks like “I’m Ready for You” and “Sorrows” make for an unfocused, heavily-reworked sound. The narrative of jealousy and argument is muddy at best, either pushed to the background or wholly drowned out by the busyness of the synth-tones and layered beats. Tiller’s attempts to innovate, then, end up only holding back.
Thankfully, if there’s one thing “Anniversary” does execute successfully, it’s the larger thematic scheme of the album. In the midst of switching between serenades and bars, lo-fi beats and busy chords, messy relationships and even messier ones, Tiller establishes a very clear theme: growth.
From the get-go, the intro track establishes that this isn’t the old Tiller in the recording booth: “Do you see, so many things have changed… But now I've been reborn.” That theme is carried out beautifully throughout, even on tracks that otherwise fall flat as a whole like “Inhale” and “Keep Doing What You're Doing.” On these tracks, Tiller finds the sweet spot between overthinking and self-reflection, a balance his music often struggles to strike.
And then there’s the Drake song, which is particularly disappointing. It lacks the hook, line, and sinker effect one would expect from the household name. What makes the flop even worse is that Tiller fans have greatly anticipated this collaboration ever since Drake first cosigned on “Don’t,” but the overhyped and highly-anticipated fantasy remains unsatisfied.
Regardless of the clout and any future success (or lack thereof) of the album, Bryson Tiller as an artist has spent a significant amount of time and energy on making new and evolved music. That effort ends up being to his detriment, clashing with the already-established sound present in the more authentic-sounding tracks. All in all, “Anniversary” feels like a diamond in the rough in comparison to “Trapsoul,” which is superior in nearly every respect. But Bryson Tiller’s signature flow still shines through — and arguably, manages to save the album.

In her latest EP “dusk,” bedroom pop-artist and occasional TikTok sensation mxmtoon delivers a contemplative meditation on quarantine. As the follow-up to her cheerful EP “dawn” released earlier in the year, “dusk” introduces us to a quieter side of the artist as she sings about her newly secluded life. In the opening track, “bon iver,” mxmtoon lilts, “Time waits for no one, but there’s beauty in the moments and the spaces in between.” “dusk” is a love song to those moments. Over the course of seven tracks, mxmtoon gazes out the window, stares at the clouds, and focuses on herself.
Musically, this latest EP is no great departure from the artist’s past aesthetic of lo-fi ukulele-tinged melancholia. But this style works especially well in “Dusk,” as the spacey production and lethargic melodies perfectly capture the ennui of the present moment. “Dusk” is easy listening, sometimes to a fault; tracks seem to melt into each other and sometimes fail to distinguish themselves. The song “wallflower” is perhaps the most guilty of this lack of distinction.This ballad about wanting to disappear is the least-produced song on the EP and, without much to support its languid melody and directionless piano accompaniment, it fails to gain its footing.
Yet there are some moments of “dusk” that sparkle through the EP’s woozy atmosphere. Notably, “ok on your own,” featuring Carly Rae Jepsen, has the energy of an early 2000s girl group number. It's a surprising shift, but a really fun one. While the song has a more traditional pop sound than others in the EP, the heavy reverb and uke makes “ok on your own” feel at home with the other tracks. “bon iver” is another strong point on the EP, especially from a production standpoint. Her voice floats above a rich mixture of acoustic and synth instruments. The result is an atmosphere that feels at once dreamy, distant, and lavish.
“dusk’s” hazy atmosphere is furthered by the videos mxmtoon released in tandem with the album. Only “bon iver” has an actual music video (featuring mxmtoon singing in a field surrounded by animated birds and flowers), but mxmtoon released an “audio” video for each of the tracks. These videos feature the songs played over sepia-toned shots of mxmtoon going about her daily life. She takes the subway wearing a mask in one of them and walks through a park in the next, and some videos are less compelling than others. The one for “bon iver,” for example, features an unedited shot of mxmtoon halfheartedly playing the guitar while looking at the album cover for “For Emma, Forever Ago.” But in general, these videos add to the lethargic atmosphere of “dusk,” portraying the often lonely, but occasionally beautiful moments which make up life in social isolation.
Lyrically, however, mxmtoon fails to shine on “dusk.” From her description of “holding onto moments” during “late night drives,” to her insistence that a “chapter has to end,” mxmtoon relies heavily on clichéd images and turn-of-phrases that could appear in any teen-centric pop song. She sings about the chaos of the world, about being lonely, about living by yourself, and about love, but all without much depth. The penultimate song, “show and tell,” itself points out the major problems with the EP. Singing about her desire for normalcy and the unfairness of the current situation, mxmtoon reveals “I don’t have much to say,” and she means it. Listeners will not leave “dusk” with a new understanding of our shared moment of isolation — the EP is a personal reflection more than it is a commentary or a reframing of the pandemic. Yet its haziness and simple symbolism is comforting nonetheless.

After months of consecutive single releases, pop artist Gia Woods has finally unveiled her debut album, “CUT SEASON.” With the release, Woods takes risks to establish her sound as an up-and-coming artist. Blending industrial electronica elements with shining hyper-pop melodies, she thoughtfully explores her own fears and struggles with identity.
The daughter of Persian immigrants, then-shy Woods was discovered in 2014 by her manager in a coffee shop performance for her high school choir class. She began her music career in earnest with the 2015 release of her debut single, “Only a Girl.” It was also with “Only a Girl” that Woods established herself as a queer pop icon, using the song to come out as lesbian to her listeners along with her friends and family. “Only a girl / Knows how a girl feels / Only a girl / Can make me feel this way,” she sings in the track, her voice crystalline over the song’s pop sheen. Shortly after, she held her debut performance as a recording artist at LA Pride 2016.
“All the messages from LGBTQ fans telling me that my song inspired them to come out made me realize what I'm doing is completely worthwhile and important,” she wrote in her “Love Letter to the LBGTQ Community,” sharing her experience with both “Only a Girl” and Pride. “Performing at LA Pride 2016 was such an overwhelming emotional experience because having my very first show at an event specifically for the LGBTQ community was a dream come true.”
From then on, Woods has been unapologetically open about her sexuality. While her music often serves as a vehicle for both LGBTQ+ representation and candid emotional expression, nowhere in her repertoire is this clearer than in “CUT SEASON.”
“It’s all a progression of reasons to cut people and toxic emotions out one by one, and as soon as I started to get into this theme, every song just kept coming,” she said of the album in a March interview with Flaunt Magazine, back when it was a work in progress.
The dark pop album centers around Woods’ own relationship with herself and previous partners, inviting listeners to empathize with — and dance to — her self discovery. Over the course of twenty minutes, it evolves from a grungy collage of synthesizers and distorted drum beats into glittering dance songs with bright melodies and uplifting lyrics.
The album’s opener, the eponymous “CUT SEASON,” starts slow and brooding, steadily building into a crescendo of crashing drums, distant sirens, and heavily-produced keyboards. The cacophony is anchored by Woods’s heavenly vocals: a perfect chaos. “I tried to take the right way / All you do is stress me out… I don't need a reason / It's cut season,” she sings, her voice low and sultry. Through this titular opening song, Woods also introduces listeners to the central dilemma of her album: a relationship she can’t fix without taking a step back first and looking at herself.
Immediately afterwards, “EGO” brings listeners deeper into Woods’s psyche as she grapples with her cyclic self-perception. “I think when you are in such a toxic cycle and it’s never-ending, and you can’t get out of it and you can’t solve these issues, you kind of step back and you’re like these issues are just paper-thin.... It’s really just your ego that’s always in the way of all these issues,” she said of the song in an interview.
A steady drum beat throughout the song creates a sense of foreboding before it explodes into the song’s chorus: “My ego loves to rough it up with your ego / Throwin' uppercuts to get equal / That's just how it goes / You want love and control, but you can’t have both,” Woods sings on top of a gritty mix of snare hits and synthesizers. The song’s musicality sounds menacing, almost dangerous as Woods lays bare her demons and insecurities in pristine harmonies.
While most of the album incorporates industrial sounds — like sirens, distorted synths, and syncopated drum beats — and other alternative pop conventions, some of the album’s tracks also open the doors for more rock influence. In “NAIVE,” for example, a swirling guitar solo towards the end of the track complements the song's electronic elements to create a dynamic blend of old and new influences.
By the end of the album, with “SABOTAGE” and “ALL I KNOW,” Gia Woods’s classic, pure pop sound is back at center stage. In “SABOTAGE,” Woods clearly expresses her own growth, making the choice to cut off her old relationships to work on herself instead. “I know I'm not good for me / Always fall back into you / No, I don't need sympathy / Yeah, I know just what to do,” she sings, as upbeat dance music drives her voice, and with it, her emotional resolve.
“ALL I KNOW,” the last song on the album, fittingly wraps up Woods’s EP-length push-and-pull between what she wants and what is good for her. The track is guitar-based, complemented by shimmering synths and summery melodies. “When life's no grеat, that's okay / There's no matter what wе do / A little bit of me, a little bit of you / And a little bit of love will get us through,” Woods sings, her lyrics and musicality both showing growth from the dark, muddled themes that dominated the release’s beginning. As Woods lets herself be free of the control she was so desperate to hold onto in songs like “EGO” and “NAIVE,” the track’s production, too, feels lighter.
Woods’ candid explorations of self cement “CUT SEASON” as a thematically powerful pop album primed for dance parties, lonely nights, and everything in between.

As the lead singer and guitarist of Big Thief, Adrianne Lenker spins elements of folk rock into a delicate but visceral sound without compare. Big Thief’s two most recent studio albums, released just months apart last year, showcased a quartet of compassionate musicians with a deep reverence for their art. On Oct. 23, Lenker once again dazzled listeners with a duo of albums — except this time, without her bandmates. Recorded in a secluded New England cabin in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, “songs” and “instrumentals” contend with the idea of finding closeness in isolation.
With the help of recording engineer Philip Weinrobe, Lenker let the newfound quiet amplify her creativity. In an interview with the New Yorker, she described the cabin itself as “like the inside of an acoustic guitar” — the instrument that takes center stage in both albums, accompanied by minimal percussion and the occasional burst of thunder or birdsong.
As Lenker’s music plays, snippets of ambient noise envelop her voice and guitar as naturally as if she had asked the woods to contribute a backing track. Her connection to her surroundings is at its strongest in “instrumentals,” two songs whose pristine tranquility somehow feels both improvisatory and deliberate.
The first of these two songs, “music for indigo,” moves along at such a leisurely tempo that it draws attention to the gaps between motifs more often plucked than strummed, where the sounds of the cabin gradually replace the decaying notes. Its soothing lilt is no coincidence — Lenker intended the track as a lullaby for her former partner. The next track, “mostly chimes,” remains true to its name as a brief guitar intro gives way to a chorus of jingling wind chimes.
Lenker wrote the albums while still reeling from a breakup, and her determination to explore the newfound emptiness in her life may explain her focus on the silence between notes. “Now there isn’t anyone to text; there are no love messages coming through. I feel so empty,” she told the New Yorker. I want to understand—what is this feeling of emptiness? Is that me? Am I just hollow and empty? Or is emptiness actually something beautiful?”
Lenker’s voice, hovering between vulnerable fragility and self-assured precision, adds another layer of magic to the 11 tracks of “songs.” The album opens with the up-tempo guitar flourish that forms the foundation of “two reverse,” its quickly ascending notes reappearing to introduce each verse. The chorus cycles through a kaleidoscope of colors that evoke the memory of a loved one: “Light blue, dark blue, grey / Crimson trail,” she sings, her voice rising and falling as she names each hue.
The album’s third track and lead single, “anything,” captures the agonizing complexity of a lost relationship in its forthright lyrics. Warm memories of doing laundry and shopping for groceries are interspersed with sharp, violent images — a Christmas Eve dinner that spirals into a fight, a dog bite that leads to an ER visit. “I don’t wanna talk about anything,” Lenker starts each chorus before repeating the phrase a step lower as the impossibility of her wishes sets in.
Several other songs attempt to portray Lenker’s constantly shifting perception of romance as her attitude fluctuates between devotion and disappointment. Her description of her partner in “forwards beckon rebound” embodies her uncertainty: “Villain and violent, infant and innocent.” On “half return,” she reckons with how someone who once meant so much to her caused her immense pain. “Honey in your mouth when you gave me my name / Tears in your eyes when you pull it likе a chain,” she sings in the second verse, lingering on the same note as if refusing to let go of the memory just yet.
Sung from the perspective of a dying parent to their daughter, “come” approaches death with hauntingly straightforward acceptance. “Don’t be afraid, my girl,” begins the chorus. Despite containing just one verse and chorus, the track is the album’s longest at over five minutes — exemplifying how Lenker harnesses emptiness as so much more than a simple lack of sound.
The final track, “my angel,” concludes the album on a gentle note. When Lenker starts to sing halfway through the track, she exalts the titular angel as a savior whose presence brings safety and love. “She kisses my eyelids and my wrists,” Lenker sings, bringing closure to the longing to “kiss, kiss your eyes again” that she expresses in “anything.” As her music blurs the boundaries of song and silence, she finds the beauty that lives where they meet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the overwhelming challenges faced by Harvard student groups operating in the pandemic, the Radcliffe Choral Society (RCS) has hit the ground running this semester. The music group is finding its rhythm, adapting to meet both the social and technological demands of a digital college experience. With no in-person performances on the horizon, RCS has focused on fostering community through Zoom hangouts and using new technology to create a virtual environment for singing this fall.
As one of the three primary student choirs at Harvard, the ensemble has been singing soprano-alto music since it was founded in 1899 as the official chorus of Radcliffe College. However, in its long tenure of performing everything from classical music to original commissioned pieces to contemporary a cappella, the Radcliffe Choral Society has never had to deal with most of its members residing off campus.
In a normal year, RCS members meet at least twice a week for more than four hours to prepare for two or three performances throughout the fall semester. But the members of the choral group do more than just sing.
“It’s a very social choir, as well, so in addition to our practices and rehearsals we go on a retreat together to Cape Cod every year, we hang out a lot on campus, we go to Boston together,” said Madison L. Fabber ’22, one of the group’s vice presidents and a contributing writer for Crimson Arts.
The group’s social dynamic, as well as the actual mechanics of singing, have been upended by the pandemic.
“It’s hard,” Fabber continued. “While not everybody who’s in RCS was in a choir before RCS, a majority of our choir is used to practicing together all in the same room. And it’s just, it’s really hard to describe how much it’s different when you can’t hear the people around you.”
Other members, including special projects manager Sophia J. Li ‘21, echoed this sentiment.
“I think the challenge is, obviously, not being in person just changes the environment that you have when you’re singing,” Li said. “During rehearsal, we’re singing in a room by ourselves, usually on mute, so it’s not just that you can’t hear other students around you, it’s that you’re not even being heard.”
The Society has begun investigating digital avenues for making music together. Li noted their use of a program called Soundtrap, which functions “like Google Docs but for music.” Soundtrap allows members of the ensemble to record themselves singing and upload it to a shared workspace.
In addition to partaking in RCS’s more technical activities through Soundtrap, members like Fabber and Li are attempting to restore some semblance of social normalcy by designating portions of rehearsal time for checking in with one another. Rachel L. Ma ’21, the manager of the group, mentioned that “it’s tough being virtual” but highlighted activities the club has arranged to connect beyond their choral work.
“Last week we had a fun little, ‘take three minutes, come up with a costume, and everyone come back on Zoom and let’s see what people have come up with,’ just to make sure we’re staying in touch,” Ma said.
Fabber said she thinks fostering a sense of community is essential to building a cohesive choral unit.
“I’m pretty sure this is not scientifically proven of course, but choirs just sound better when everybody knows each other and feels comfortable with each other, because you take more risks vocally and you feel comfortable,” she said.
Li discussed having a similar community-oriented experience, emphasizing the group’s enthusiasm and desire to stay connected.
“Someone last week was like, ‘Oh, who wants to start a knitting group?’ And then she made a Slack channel, and we’re going to meet and knit for an hour every Friday over Zoom,” Li said.
As for sharing their talents with the Harvard community this fall, Fabber noted that the group had not yet finalized its plans for concerts.
College students are tasked with navigating unprecedented circumstances in order to socialize this year, and the effects of transitioning to a digital learning environment have extended far beyond the classroom. Members of the Radcliffe Choral Society, however, have managed to rise to the occasion and enjoy a socially distanced, yet fulfilling, choral experience this fall.

Eight months ago, I never would have imagined myself listening to country music from the trunk of a car. But last month, it had been so long since I’d been to a concert that I was more than willing to give a drive-in Chase Rice concert a try.
I saw my first-ever concert at age 11. I bounced in my chair at The Giant Center in Hershey, Pa. waiting for Selena Gomez to come on stage. Not even an ominous weather forecast could hinder my excitement as the lights finally dimmed. Something magical happened when those stadium lights went down; a crowd became one. One heart that dropped. One voice that screamed. Ushers handed out plastic ponchos as it began to thunder, and like a cheesy romanticized movie I screamed “Slow Down,” along with my parents, Selena, and the thousands of others huddled together in the rain. The flashing lights sparkled in the raindrops, and the music was loud enough to mask any thunder.
From major music festivals with Travis Scott and Zedd to The Philadelphia Orchestra, I have found the same connection in music crowds. Perhaps this nostalgia for concerts is why, despite a minimal interest in country music and even less knowledge of his songs, I dragged a few friends to go see a drive-in Chase Rice concert. I was skeptical when I first saw Rice’s bio on the advertisement, but the North Carolina country musician’s discography soon grew on me. His single “Eyes on You” is catchy even for someone not familiar with country music, and I learned that he co-wrote the popular song “Cruise” with Florida Georgia Line.
At any other concert, they’d be shouting at us in line to have our tickets ready. When I drove to see Chase Rice, I peered out our car’s front window and saw signs. “Please have your mobile tickets ready” they read, and after putting on masks we rolled down the window to get our tickets scanned. Two men directed us to a parking spot in the front row, and we clamored into the trunk to wait for Rice to come out.
My initial reaction was a pessimistic one — the only thing similar to a typical concert seemed to be the music itself. Rice came out and sat on a wooden stool, setting a calming ambiance on stage different from any I’d ever seen before. He said hello, how happy he was to be here, and told us to look out for his photographer walking around the lot. Next to him was the usual concert stadium screen displaying the radio station that was amplifying the music. Similar to a drive-in movie and antithetical to a standard concert, the sound was so soft that, if we spoke in the trunk, Rice sounded far away. Every concert separates the artist from the attendees, but this one was different. Six feet felt larger than ever before.
In a concert crowd, the proximity to others steals any individuality of sound and amplifies one large voice. This sense of togetherness from sound waves was lost in a socially distanced concert — the sounds were distant, so distant that the car next to us was playing music on a speaker and we could barely hear it. The show was sold-out, but because the cars blocked our view, we could only see the people adjacent to us. Even with the four surrounding groups, tuning out the rest of the world is simple within the four walls of a trunk. Rice strummed his guitar while we relished in the warmth of our blankets and the sounds of one other.
It wasn’t until looking outside the window that the feeling of isolation dissipated. The surrounding groups huddled around in lawn chairs and on the backs of trucks eating and drinking and laughing together. A woman waved at me while I was peering out the window, and her enthusiasm was (almost) enough to excite me about country music. When you looked for it, there was a palpable excitement in the air: the memory of safe gatherings mingled with the anticipation of a new experience. It was no concert crowd, but innovative social distancing allowed us to be isolated, together.
With our lack of prior Chase Rice knowledge, it was a sigh of relief when he began to sing “Cruise.” Suddenly, the apprehension to sing from both my friends and the groups around us eased. People took that leap of faith to sing without the security of a crowd around them.The concert was beginning to end, and the song’s familiarity was welcome during a night of such newness. It was easy for me to sit inside our trunk and remember the days of calling Ubers to drop us off outside of concerts, but we soon began to enjoy the trunk’s serenity. We were able to look outside and revel in the beauty within our new normal.

Perhaps the best thing an AC/DC song can sound like is, well, an AC/DC song. Or, at least, that’s what one would gather from listening to the rock group’s latest single, “Shot In The Dark.”
Written sometime before the passing of the rock and roll band’s co-founder and rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young in 2017, the track was released on Oct. 7 in anticipation of the band’s upcoming album, “Power Up.” The first single off the album, “Shot In The Dark” is pure, unbridled AC/DC — signifying a major comeback for the Australian band after their 2016 hiatus.
The track begins with co-founder Angus Young’s sludgy, bluesy guitar playing as it leads the way for Brian Johnson’s iconic metal-tinged vocals and Phil Rudd’s sharp, violent drumming. Immediately, the powerful combination of hard rock riffs and bluesy bass lines makes clear that “Shot In The Dark” is primed to join the ranks of AC/DC classics. In fact, the track debuted at number five on Billboard’s mainstream rock charts on Oct. 17, making it the first song to chart so highly with its debut in over a decade.
At a time of upheaval and general strangeness, “Shot In The Dark” reliably brings listeners back to a time when things were simpler: the mid ’80s. “Blasting on the radio, breaking on the TV show / Send it out on all the wires / And if I didn't know any better, your mission is to party / Till the broad daylight,” Johnson sings of his entourage’s late-night antics, his voice raging over a heavy mix of crashing cymbals, thumping bass lines, and gritty power chord guitars.
Where the track’s lyrics fail in terms of relatability to the current, they make up for in nostalgia points. With “Shot In The Dark,” AC/DC immerses listeners in the height of ’80s debauchery and rock mythology, where rockstars would spend the nights partying without a care (and superfans would spend their days pissing off their parents by playing AC/DC’s music too loud in their basement). Young’s soaring guitar shredding at the song’s bridge provides the final ingredient to complete the modern classic.
More and more artists are turning to their own versions of quarantine-ready music, like Taylor Swift’s stripped-back “Folklore” or Fiona Apple’s musically expansive “Fetch the Bolt Cutters.” AC/DC, however, breaks from that narrative. Instead, they choose to stick to what they know best, and with it provide a deeply needed sense of continuity within the greater sphere of rock and roll legend.

Although it was released almost 60 years ago in 1964, Stanley Kubrick's film “Dr. Strangelove” is still downright absurd today. The characters are crazy, the theories are wild, and the spectrum of jokes land across the Big Board. Yet behind its facade of sheer lunacy, “Dr. Strangelove” is dreadfully sane — and even tugs at heartstrings you didn't know existed.
Following deranged United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack Ripper's (Sterling Hayden) deployment of his bombing wing, “Dr. Strangelove” becomes steadily more chaotic. The POTUS, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), attempts to prevent the fleet of hydrogen-bomb toting B-52 bombers from reaching their targets. Initially, he demands General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) to recall the planes, but after failing to do so, he warns Soviet Premier Dimitri Kissov of the incoming attack. However, all hope appears lost when Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) spuriously reveals the existence of their Doomsday Machine, an “automated and irrevocable” system of nuclear bombs that would blanket the entire world in radioactive holocaust.
At its worst, the black comedy genre is as satisfying as a wrapped stick of gum. Both aim audiences at a specific outcome: Either a sweet strawberry-flavored release, or a dark thematic catharsis that comes with gut-splitting entertainment. Done poorly, this thematic catharsis never comes to surface — the "essence," as Gen. Ripper would say, is denied. A crudely-executed black comedy not only fails to be humorous, but with that shortcoming, it also loses its ultimate purpose. Either an actor delivers the line crooked, the doom isn’t sufficiently dreadful, or the funny man simply doesn't make you laugh.
“Dr. Strangelove,” though, like Premier Kissov’s voice over the hotline, comes through just fine. Kubrick finely whips lampooning social commentary into an otherwise plain Cold War subtext. In nearly every scene, Kubrick openly declares dramatic irony through staging and dialogue. Take the Strategic Air Command's motto, “Peace is Our Profession,” which ostensibly decorates the interior and exterior of Gen. Ripper's Burpelson base. Below these motto-filled signboards, heated firefights break out as U.S. Army troops are deployed in an operation to secure Burpelson and revert Ripper's order. What's even more ironic is that the only casualties of a “shooting war” in the film come during this heated infiltration, which itself is self-defeating to peace.
Kubrick cleverly infuses this deadly irony to show what happens when communications are obstructed. Fundamentally, the tragedy lies in dialogue being lost in translation, which begs the question: Who do you blame? What's ironic is that many of the maladapted situations that play out in the film (such as the misused hotline between President Muffley and Premier Kissov) could have been easily avoided with proper considerations and equipment. However, Kubrick does not romanticize the War, nor does he downplay its terrifying implications. By creating caricatures of the foolish men with power, Kubrick effectively trains the viewer to his own visions on society itself: people with power are out of touch with reality and will destroy us all. Gens. Ripper and Turgidson literally embody this madness, perpetuating radical claims. Ripper fiercely purports his self-formulated Communist conspiracy of fluoridation of American waterways, delivering the ultimate sap of essence. Turgidson, toying with unsubstantiated casualty figures of a nuclear war, claims a coordinated preemptive strike limits retaliation to a “modest” 20 million Americans killed. As the grown men begin to brawl in the War Room, Kubrick, too, wrestles with a world gone M.A.D. to cogently warn of blind trust in the system, one which might cause your unheeded demise or might abandon you in a deep, dark mine shaft.
While the terrors of the Cold War have largely subsided since the release of “Dr. Strangelove,” Kubrick's unsettling imagery, which suggests the inevitability of nuclear war, can still strike fear into one's heart — even today. Up until the end, Kubrick sharply saturates “Dr. Strangelove” with conflictory emotions of joy and panic, or of patriotic fervor and vexed hatred. Although its excessive signaling at first deters, “Dr. Strangelove” wears on you as its fallout envelops the mind. While Vera Lynn's “We'll Meet Again” plays in soothing chorus, choreographed shots of nuclear explosions fill the screen: When we meet again, my dear friend “Dr. Strangelove”?

The protestors outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention chant in unison: “The whole world is watching.”
There are films that are good, there are films that are great, and there are films that must be watched.
In an era characterized both by heightened political divisiveness and an abysmally declining movie industry, the arrival of Aaron Sorkin’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7” is more than aptly timed. The master screenwriter’s newest sensation is the fourth film adaptation of the trial of Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weine. These people constitute the Chicago Seven, who were tried by President Nixon’s Republican administration with conspiracy to incite a riot at the 1968 DNC.
While it doesn't stand out as a visual masterpiece, Sorkin's dizzying rhetoric and politically-charged screenplay arrest the viewer's eye. Sorkin’s signature screenwriting prowess, particularly his effortless construction of conversation, renders “The Trial of the Chicago 7” as much a richly intellectual experience as a stirring cinematic one.
Much of Sorkin's dialogue is anchored in enduring American archetypes of masculinity. For instance, upon meeting prosecutor Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the newly elected Attorney General John N. Mitchell (John Doman) impressed the need to charge the Chicago Seven. “I can’t let these shitty little fairies be a threat to national security,” he said. "The decade’s over. The grownups are back.”
This masculine rhetoric rears its head in every line of the script as Sorkin challenges viewers with an intimate conversation about an American status quo riddled with cyclical strains of injustice. There is a clear discrepancy, Sorkin contends, between the dignity of archetypal masculinity and how the American legal system achieves its ambitions through anything but decency. In reference to the federal government’s decision to encourage an undercover agent to spark a romantic relationship, Jerry Rubin (Jeremy Strong) asks, “Aren’t there ethics rules?”
The answer grows all too clear as the film progresses. No. There are no rules of ethics within the walls of the Chicagoan courtroom, which withstands the antics of a politically-motivated prosecution and a politically complicit judge. There are no rules of ethics when the judge orders Black Panther Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) be taken out of the courtroom, only to be dragged back in — to the horror of every spectator — beaten, bound, and gagged.
Through his clever, often humorous, but always uncomfortably truthful dialogue, Sorkin unpacks the role injustice has in shaping a revolutionary. As the film capitalizes on tension between hippie Abbie Hoffman (Sacha Baron Cohen) and student activist Tom Hayden (Eddie Redmayne), the two reveal an underlying animosity that divides the protestors. Hoffman implicitly states that Hayden has benefited from the Chicago riots; without the Chicago riots, the Hayden that Americans wrote down in history would have been a nameless nobody.
“We’re not goin’ to jail because of what we did, we’re goin’ to jail because of who we are!” Hoffman exclaims, laughing maniacally as he reaches the apex of his fight with Hayden. “Think about that the next time you shrug off cultural revolution.”
Hoffman paints a dreary picture of not only the American legal system, but American politics at large. Despite the good intentions of the democratic system, if the people who populate that system have no regard for other people, particularly those who appear different or harbor differing ideas, justice is perennially jeopardized.
Despite the film’s commendable attempts to provide depth for all seven of the titular defendants, Sacha Baron Cohen's Abbie is the clear winner. The comedian’s intellectual ease coupled with occasional outbursts of emotive forcefulness result in a sensational performance.
What does it mean for the world to be watching? Is history not made in the most unsung moments, where the decisions that people make are not remembered nor recorded? In an era of maddening politics and sobering crisis, Sorkin presents his American audiences with a particularly American form of injustice. As the screen fades to black, the familiar protest chant is heard once again:
“The whole world is watching!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not as euphoric as “Lovers Rock” or as exciting as “Mangrove,” but director Steve McQueen's “Red, White and Blue” is a cogent, politically charged meditation on structural racism. Along with “Lovers Rock” and “Mangrove,” “Red, White and Blue” is part of McQueen’s anthology “Small Axe” — a series of five biographical films that capture the West Indian experience in Britain from the sixties to the eighties. “Red, White and Blue” is a key entry in that series: It asks timely questions on police brutality, delivers a balanced well paced plot, and features a strong lead performance from John Boyega.
In his latest film, McQueen asks two central questions: Is police brutality the symptom of a few bad eggs or a deeper systemic rot? And can you truly challenge that system by playing the inside game? Leroy Logan (Boyega) is a forensic scientist, a position his father — who invested in his education — is extremely proud of. But to everyone’s surprise, Leroy takes a “demotion” and enlists in the police in an attempt to change the law enforcement system from within.
Soon, Leroy finds himself confronted with the brutal, but perhaps unsurprising, reality that changing a bigoted, predominantly white institution from the inside is an excruciating task that leaves a lasting mental toll. Despite leading the rest of the other cadets in training, Leroy is one of the few officers rejected for a promotion. At the same time, he starts finding that members of the West Indian community begin alienating him as a “traitor.” It’s a situation that’s further complicated when Leroy’s father, a victim of police brutality, is denied a day in court to clear his name. “Red, White and Blue” depicts Leroy’s struggles as he must weigh his sense of duty in bringing justice to his community against the turmoil of fighting an upstream battle against a bitterly entrenched system.
Boyega (“Attack the Block” and Disney’s “Star Wars” sequel trilogy) delivers a dynamic performance in the challenging lead role: He’s likable and relatable, but also calculating when his peers doubt him, and explosive when they endanger him. On the shoulders of his performance, “Red, White and Blue” deftly navigates huge shifts in tone from a fuzzy nostalgia for the eighties to the inescapable tension of race relations.
McQueen lands his social commentary much more effectively in “Red, White and Blue” than in “Mangrove,” which also explored structural racism in the law enforcement system. This is largely because “Red, White and Blue” is not as exposition-heavy and doesn’t juggle as many main characters, allowing McQueen to give the audience breathers during which they can better internalize the drama on screen. This takes the form of an easy ‘80s soundtrack and an occasionally dormant camera, which sits in the corner of a room or in the backseat of a car as a passive observer — content with letting audiences discover the drama of the film themselves.
However, for all the thematic questions McQueen raises and all the character arcs the film develops, “Red, White and Blue” doesn’t devote much time for closure. This is particularly disappointing because towards the end of the film, McQueen indulged in multiple, explosive confrontations that teetered on melodrama. But leaving audiences without much in the way of payoffs to these setups, McQueen leaves those scenes of escalation feeling empty — nothing more than a hollow burst of shouting that doesn’t significantly move the plot or its characters.
McQueen leaves audiences wanting more, but perhaps that’s the effect the acclaimed filmmaker sought to achieve — to leave audiences with a feeling of unsettled eeriness because the call to justice that brought Leroy Logan to action 40 years ago remains unanswered today. In light of police brutality in the United States and around the Western world, “Red, White and Blue” is a stirring call to confront the broken pieces of the law enforcement system.
“Red, White and Blue” premiered at the New York Film Festival on Oct. 3 and will be released on Amazon Prime Video on Dec. 18.

“How are you doing?”
The question seems simple enough. But given today’s charged socio-political moment, the opening remark of Shawn Finnie, Associate Director for Member Outreach at the Academy, invited a multitude of potential answers. Delroy Lindo (“Da 5 Bloods”), Gina Prince-Bythewood (“Love and Basketball” and “The Old Guard”), and T. J. Martin (“LA92” and “Undefeated”) provided three unique responses.
“Icon Mann: We Are the Culture” was released on Oct. 1 on YouTube and marks the seventh installment in the “Academy Dialogues: It Starts with Us” series. “Academy Dialogues” explores race, gender, equity, and inclusivity in film by inviting actors and filmmakers to engage in virtual conversation.
Prince-Bythewood answered Finnie’s question by sharing how, just two days before, her 19-year-old son was pulled over by the police for speeding. Rather than having the luxury of scolding him for his ticket, Prince-Bythewood noted, she and her husband were simply relieved that he had returned home safe.
Martin continued Prince-Bythewood’s acknowledgement of current racial tensions, voicing his desire for transparent dialogue.
“The flaws of this country — just the window, the curtains — have been opened. And the curtains are open,” Martin said. “I am appalled by the inability to actually have an empathetic conversation about who we are as a community, and that I find really unnerving.”
Finnie then asked the creators about their opinions on the political function of art.
Both Lindo and Martin spoke of the challenge of leaning into race as a creative prism without being circumscribed by it. While noting the interdependence of artistic and political sensibility, Lindo also emphasized the importance of first acknowledging his basic identity as a human being.
“I think I am not defining my various responses as an artist. I think I’m defining my responses as a human being on the planet,” Lindo said.
Martin recounted how his directing of the vérité (shot without voiceover) documentary “Undefeated” encouraged him to reflect critically on filmic portrayals of race and class. In “Undefeated,” a white volunteer coach from East Memphis — markedly more affluent and white than the, as Martin emphasized, “99.9% Black” North Memphis — attempts to lead a high school football team to victory. Martin addressed the reservations about the film’s apparent spin on a “white knight story.”
“That became a challenge creatively,” Martin said, “but it was something that was very necessary, to get a film for people to actually look beyond race and class and acknowledge it at the same time.”
When reflecting on her distinct experience with race and belonging, Prince-Bythewood spoke of her adoption by a Salvadoran mother and Irish father. She expressed how she vividly remembers going to the theater in a nearly all-white area as a 17-year-old and seeing Nola Darling in the trailer for Spike Lee’s “She’s Gotta Have It.”
“It was me seeing someone who looked like me up on that big screen, and I was floored. And I’ve never forgotten that feeling,” Prince-Bythewood said.
Lindo underscored his wish for Black art not to be seen simply as representation but, rather, its own form of universal creative expression.
“I’ve gotten the gift of being a part of very specifically examining something through the lens of who I am as a Black individual, sharing that with the world, and hopefully affirming the humanity — not the Black humanity — the humanity that exists in those journeys. And that’s extraordinary,” Lindo said.
Finnie then posed questions regarding the role of a genuine ally. Prince-Bythewood and Martin underlined promising trends of diverse allyship catalyzed by the Black Lives Matter movement in the past months. However, the three creators also expressed doubts about how superficial allyship might be in the current movement.
“The part that I’m a little more wary about is — because we do live in a day and age when everyone is almost a walking brand through social media, whatever it may be — is Black pain, is that a fad?” Martin asked. “Does your support fade away because the dominant community is no longer talking about it?”
Lindo corroborated Martin’s ruminations on the potential limits of allyship, admonishing against the “potential fadism of Black pain” and expressing the need for allies to commit to small, regular actions to effect enduring change.
Allyship, he noted, “can take many forms, as long as one is doing something on an ongoing basis to enact change.”
As Finnie concluded the dialogue and thanked the creators for their involvement, Lindo expressed a final thought regarding how his artistic work could be deeply personal, yet bear universal implications.
“Through our work, our engaging our work,” Lindo said, “we are impacting, frankly, the world. And I do not believe that is hyperbole. I believe it to be true.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2016 election came as a shock — even if it shouldn't have. I remember exactly where I was that night. Awake at 5 a.m. Spanish time, eagerly refreshing and cursing at the New York Times’s infamous needle. Four years and a pandemic later, the memory still haunts me.
Of course, 2020 is not 2016. Joseph R. Biden's lead is significantly larger than Hillary R. Clinton's ever was, and most pollsters agree that undecided voters (who decisively broke for Trump in 2016) are few and far between. But the outcome is still far from guaranteed. From concerns over lackluster Black and Latinx turnout to alarming Supreme Court rulings (including Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s assessment that late absentee ballots shouldn't be allowed to flip a state, as if that specific set of Democratic-leaning votes was somehow illegitimate), uncertainty has plagued the last few days of the campaign. And that doesn't even take into account the small but concerning possibility that the results will be outright rejected by a volatile president. Trump, despite the polls, could still be re-elected.
So what then? What if he wins? Or, for that matter, what if he refuses to lose?
Yale Philosophy Professor Jason Stanley sees tomorrow's contest as “a survival election” for American democracy. He thinks the Trump administration has been “performing fascism,” embracing its key elements.
“Fascist talking, fascist propaganda, a lot of white nationalism, we've seen a lot of fascist symbolism,” Stanley said in an interview.
Of course, a president performing fascism doesn't mean the country is dominated by a fascist regime. As Stanely is quick to note, he's not in prison for his vocal criticism. But it does signal a concerning trend. The United States is sprinting towards authoritarianism. Over the past four years, its status has fallen from that of a “full” to a “flawed” democracy, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's "Democracy Index" report; the Republican Party has morphed significantly and is now, by some measures, ideologically closer to Hungary's autocratic government than to any of its Western European peers.
Universities are likely to find themselves caught in this illiberal wave. Indeed, American colleges have already become a target of the president and his party. They have threatened our tax-exempt status over absurd accusations of “radical left indoctrination” and pushed to dismantle affirmative action and sexual assault guidelines. The moves might be politically savvy — after all, attacking the kind of elite education that Trump himself enjoyed is much in line with his particular brand of golden-toilet-faux-populism, particularly at a time when a majority of Republicans believe that universities have a negative effect on the nation.
According to Stanley, universities are too eager to dispel these concerns, too anxious to appear impartial in political struggles. “Harvard University is not a den of Marxist radicals,” he said. But University administrators often fail to counter the narrative, trying to prove their bipartisan character instead.
“What I see universities doing is going ‘No, no, don't worry! We don't have any radicals, not us!’” Stanley deems this “anticipatory obedience,” borrowing a Timothy Snyder term that alludes to the pre-emptive institutional adjustment to increasingly undemocratic regimes. So Harvard, instead of openly defending its right to foster Marxists and embrace intellectual exchange, finds itself in a bad faith argument over whether our disproportionately wealthy student body is, in fact, a neo-Trotskyist commune.
Stanley’s argument reminded me of a friend’s terribly optimistic prediction in the immediate aftermath of the David D. Kane controversy. He thought that Harvard would “disinvite [Charles A.] Murray, sack Kane, and become a nightly topic on Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Whether a pre-emptive concern over the kind of anti-“cancel culture” backlash shaped our institution's poor decision making is uncertain. Yet it offers a plausible explanation for our University’s lack of boldness on issues ranging from establishing a multi-cultural center to creating an ethnic studies program. It goes back to our deeply flawed core message — at times parroted by University officials — that we are fundamentally an apolitical institution. But academia is never apolitical — particularly not when it faces increasing governmental encroachment. Trump’s incoherent rants about the 1619 Project might seem harmless now, but they are eerily similar to similar lines of attack against progressive academia that led to the outright ban of gender studies in Hungarian colleges.
According to Stanley, we’re not above the partisan fray. “Don't try to be apolitical. A university is a political institution. That's why it's under siege in these moments.”
What openly embracing this political role looks like is harder to say. For some, it means direct action — highlighting the inconsistencies between your institution’s stated mission and the incongruencies it perpetuates. Early in Trump’s mandate, Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government came under fire after the resignation of Professor Bo A.M. Rothstein over the school’s ties to Leonard Blavatnik. Blavatnik (whose donation earned him the naming rights to the school) philanthropically supported Oxford’s research on better governance, yet simultaneously donated to President Trump’s Inaugural Committee. The committee and its donations have been broadly seen as an easy way to purchase access to the administration. (A spokesperson for the Blavatnik School of Government declined to comment beyond the School’s statement on the matter, reiterating that Blavatnik has never attempted to direct the school’s work; a spokesperson for Mr. Blavatnik declined to comment.)
This incongruence, the tension that Rothstein described as a “sharp conflict” between his work and the donations of the man who helped fund it, proved too much.
Rothstein believed that not resigning “would destroy [his] credibility as an intellectual and as a researcher.” He’d looked into Blavatnik when he was offered the position at the school, and analyzed the concerns brought up by human rights activists that highlighted Blavatnik’s alleged ties to the Russian Government, though Blavatnik’s lawyers at the time denied he was an "associate of Vladimir Putin" and said he had no ties to a "campaign of harassment" in Russia. Rothstein himself couldn’t find a smoking gun.
“I'm pretty sure you cannot make that enormous amount of money without stepping on some toes, but that is how capitalism works — I didn't invent it,” Rothstein said.
But when he learned of Blavatnik’s ties to the Trump administration — one he views as antithetical to his life’s work on good governance — he simply couldn’t continue in his position. Universities, he said, have “important normative philosophical values,” red lines on issues like democracy and freedom of speech that ought not to be crossed.
Mr. Blavatnik is also a prominent Harvard donor and a member of the Harvard University Global Advisory Council responsible for the naming of the Blavatnik Institute, Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator, and Blavatnik Fellowship. Reached for comment for this article, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain described the GAC as a group of the University’s alumni and friends from around the world who meet annually with the President, senior leadership, and other members of the community regarding the University’s global footprint and agenda.
Our University’s politicization (or rather, its acceptance of its unavoidably political character) is crucial to the survival of academia in an increasingly hostile national environment. It might mean looking at our donations to make sure we don’t engage with, for example, authoritarian-leaning billionaires. It might include continuing our recent, more combative stance; or even making actual space for radicals within academia. As Stanley puts it, “if universities are supposed to be filled with Marxists, maybe hire a Marxist.”

Clarification: A previous version of this article stated that Blavatnik did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To clarify, the request was sent to Blavatnik through his company, Access Industries, who declined to comment. This article has been updated accordingly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay sent an email to faculty and staff with an update on how the school is planning for the spring semester. “Early indicators of what the remote academic experience this fall has been like are favorable,” she wrote. According to surveys administered by FAS, students are engaged with their instructors, “a factor identified as essential to successful remote learning.”
That would seem like a particularly rosy picture of what has been a difficult semester to say the least.
Earlier this month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said that the College’s public health measures, meant to contain the spread of COVID-19, were successful enough to raise the possibility of inviting more students back for the spring. While five graduate schools have already announced plans to remain virtual through the spring, and instruction will continue online regardless of how many students are invited to live on campus, this announcement raises questions about what our spring will look like.
Last week, Khurana and Gay began to answer some of those questions: The spring class schedule will run as normal, from January 25 to April 28, though spring break will be replaced by five intermittent “wellness days.”
As the administration continues to plan for the spring, we encourage them to take a more nuanced look at what virtual education has really meant for students. The Pulse survey would seem not to paint a complete picture. Zoom fatigue is a real and pressing concern — and especially at this midpoint of the semester, the exhaustion of long days of hopping in and out of Zoom rooms, staring at the empty waiting rooms, sighing through the glitches, lags, and freezes is taking its toll.
Indeed, there’s something to be said, moving forward, for less Zoom, not more. Instead of raising the requirements of a Harvard education — more hours of required engagement with all the additional obligations that come with those hours — the College should consider how it could maintain the quality of its education with a more minimalist approach.
We urge the College to reconsider its initial approach of setting high online time requirements — 8 to 12 hours of engagement per course per week — and to more carefully consider how those time demands may actually make learning more burdensome, a series of virtual hoops to jump through. Smaller, shorter courses with a higher ratio of independent work, for example, may, at least for some students, be a healthier online learning style.
How will the University accommodate the needs of students to be away from their screens in the material reality of their lives? How will it acknowledge that living online is itself quite taxing? Creating more flexible and downsized online requirements may be one important part of that work for the coming term.
While that might nominally and quantitatively reduce engagement (as tracked by a survey), it may in fact improve the quality of that engagement and allow students to engage on their own terms.

What’s so important about rhyme? Why does it have a stranglehold on so much of humanity’s collective creative output? It has aesthetic power: “Let us go then, you and I / When the evening is spread out against the sky.” It flaunts wit: Lin-Manuel Miranda rhyming “jettison” with “debt is in.” And some artists show how much they value these qualities when they reach a little too far for a rhyme: “Don’t ever fix your lips like collagen / And say something when you gon’ end up apologin.” Well done, Kanye.
But rhyming is not just aesthetic. It establishes a constraint that can jumpstart the creative process. More than that, it prompts us to connect words that we otherwise wouldn’t, simply because they rhyme. Words have semantic properties — their definitions and connotations — and syntactic ones, which we’ll broaden a bit to just mean not semantic.
When we force ourselves to rhyme, words are brought together because of purely syntactic similarities, which allows us to discover semantic similarities — similarities in meaning — that we might have missed. The power of syntactic reasoning might be obvious in rhyme, but it’s incredible in its far-reaching utility.
Stanford mathematician Ravi D. Vakil tells his graduate students not to despair when they go to academic talks that mostly fly over their heads. Over time, they’ll keep hearing the same words, though they may not hammer down their definitions at first. Eventually, they’ll “be able to make sentences using those words; [they] won’t know what the words mean, but [they’ll] know the sentence is correct.” Not only that, but they’ll be able to formulate mathematically interesting questions using those words. Without knowing what they mean!
And when a mathematician actually knows what all the words mean, the rhyming principle can play out in spectacular ways.
Case Western mathematician Mark W. Meckes tells the story of how he once read a paper whose acknowledgments included the line, “Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Mark Meckes, whose talk in Marseille in May of this year provided the final insight I needed to completely answer Kuperberg's Conjecture.” Professor Meckes had never heard of Kuperberg’s Conjecture. And after reading the relevant paper, he still couldn’t figure out how anything he’d ever done could possibly have contributed to this solution.
Mathematical concepts brought together by Professor Meckes for one reason inspired another academic to draw entirely different connections between those same concepts. In rhyme, a syntactic juxtaposition allows us to find unrelated semantic similarities. In this case, one set of semantic juxtapositions allowed academics to find unrelated semantic similarities.
We can observe a similar dynamic in literature. Critic Harold Bloom staked his literary theory in large part on “poetic misreading.” He argued that poets, faced with an all-encompassing literary canon, cannot escape it. But at the same time, they can’t engage with it faithfully without sacrificing some originality. Instead, poets draw on the richness of the canon — the countless juxtapositions made with whatever justification — and misinterpret those juxtapositions, discovering new justifications and so creating new ideas.
This idea of creative misinterpretation affects even everyday conversation. We’re used to treating speech as a direct transmission of information when in reality, any audience will miss far too much of the context in our head. We are constantly being misunderstood in subtle ways we might not even realize. Words enter minds faintly altered, and often instead of even trying to choose the interpretation that best approximates intent, we slide into the one that’s easiest for us.
This is a persistent problem for journalists. In an interview, misinterpretations are an unfortunate inevitability. Journalism, after all, is about real discovery — striving for an accurate record of reality. But for a columnist — well, good conversation, like math and literature, is often less about approximating a particular instance of reality than creating an interesting idea.
Ultimately, creative misinterpretation is useful because of how much harder it is to create than to discover. Anytime we read or listen to someone, we have to do some work to find justification for the ideas they have juxtaposed. Because we can’t get inside their head, there is a chance we will come up with new justifications that don’t match theirs. This is creation by way of discovery.
Periodically, when I see a Harvard billing statement or hear a tired platitude about the value of a liberal arts education, I wonder why I’m not sitting in a library going through OpenCourseware videos with a couple of friends. A cynical answer is that I’m signaling to employers. A depressing answer is that I’m paying my professor to embarrass me into doing problem sets. A cliched answer is that a liberal arts education teaches me how to think.
But an answer that appeals to me is the constant opportunity for creative misinterpretation. We are surrounded by smart people thinking about wildly different things in wildly different ways. We are surrounded by countless juxtapositions, bombarded daily with miscommunication. And we get to misinterpret it all however we want.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Luke D. M. Albert ’22 has spent months trying to flip Arizona blue.
The state has sided with the Republican presidential candidate in every election for the last 24 years. Still, disappointing results aren’t the potential outcome keeping Albert up at night. He worries about post-election scenes more commonly associated with autocracies than the U.S.: “possible political violence from the president stoking it amongst his supporters” and the federal judiciary intervening to “cut off the counting of ballots,” to name a few.
“I’m just worried about interference with that process — with the democratic process and the election,” said Albert, who took the fall semester off to work virtually as a field organizer for the Arizona Democratic Party. “So definitely have a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear that sort of keeps me going. But focusing on my work is good, talking to voters is exciting, and I’m definitely very hopeful about the outcome we’re going to see here.”
Dispersed around the globe, Harvard’s majority-liberal student body has been left to grapple with anxiety and apprehension as tomorrow’s election approaches.
“I’m very stressed, very anxious,” said R. Elizabeth Hoveland ’22. “Very excited to not be stressed and anxious anymore.”
But, she added, “knowing that we probably won’t know the results on Tuesday is really scary.”
Michael Zhu ’22 also said he is unsettled by potential uncertainty in the days to come. The prospect of the U.S. Supreme Court deciding the election — as it did in 2000 when seven justices ruled to halt a crucial recount in Florida — is “very worrying,” he said.
“I wasn’t around for 2000, but everything I’ve read about it is that it was a complete dumpster fire of an election debacle — as much, or even more, than 2016 was,” Zhu said. “And so the idea that we’re hurtling towards something like that again is definitely very concerning.”
Hoveland has been working as a volunteer training captain for the Montana Democratic Coordinated Campaign while still enrolled at the College. Teaching fellows and professors at Harvard have been “super understanding” of her campaign commitments, she said.
“It really is a good symbiotic relationship that I wasn’t expecting,” she said. “But I think 2020 is such a unique year in so many of these aspects that people are a lot more understanding than if, say, I was doing this in 2018 or even 2016.”
In Montana, which voted for President Donald J. Trump by 20 points in 2016, Hoveland is focused on down-ballot races, including a closely-watched U.S. Senate campaign between Governor Steve Bullock and incumbent Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.).
“I am acting as if we’re down 20 points,” she said, although polling shows the Senate race to be within the margin of error. “I want to be able to keep working and keep the momentum going as if we’re losing, whether or not we are.”
Many undergraduates have worked on campaigns this cycle, even as most candidates organize virtually.
“The fact that many of us are living in our home communities and have exited the Harvard bubble, I think, just makes the political issues in this election so much more salient to us,” said Richard M. Sweeney ’21, who has informally helped involve Harvard students with the Biden campaign. “We’ve seen how the politics of today is quite literally tearing some of our communities apart. And being outside of the Harvard bubble and in our homes, I think, is motivating a lot of my peers to action.”
President Trump’s victory in 2016 halted academic work in many Harvard courses during the days after the election. This year, some courses have made scheduling adjustments in advance.
“I know after the election in 2016 it was really tough on a lot of students the day after,” Rick Li ’21, a Crimson Arts editor, said last week. “I could imagine that a lot of students might feel really isolated — not just on campus, but even wherever they live.”
Hoveland, the Montana Democrats organizer, said she plans to put academics on the back burner for at least the next two days.
“It’s hard to manage anxiety, but being able to see the end goal is really helpful,” she said. “Being able to see what we’re trying to get to, and just how possible — not just possible, plausible — it is that we get to this end goal is really helpful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month after its due date, 84 percent of College students have completed the Title IX Office’s annual compulsory training module, according to University Title IX Coordinator Nicole M. Merhill.
In 2018 and 2019, the College only permitted students who had completed the module to enroll in fall courses. This year, administrators gave students a grace period before noncompletion affected their ability to select classes, tying the module to spring — rather than fall — registration. The module aims to educate undergraduates about the University’s Title IX sexual harassment and misconduct policies, procedures, and resources.
In 2018, 100 percent of undergraduates had completed the training by mid-September. Last year, 99 percent of students did the same.
Merhill wrote in an emailed statement that her office rolled out the module later than usual to address updated federal and University-wide Title IX rules and to allow “flexibility for completion” during the remote semester. In August, the University released two interim policies in compliance with new federal Title IX regulations issued in early May by the U.S. Department of Education. The federal regulations narrowed the definition of sexual misconduct and mandated that schools hold live hearings in the grievance process.
“It was important to the Title IX Office to ensure those policies were addressed in this year’s eLearning module,” Merhill wrote. “Additionally, considering the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the move to remote learning for many Harvard students, flexibility for completion, with a much longer timeline than in previous years, seemed valuable with the many unknowns students faced.”
On Sept. 2, College Title IX Coordinators Brian Libby and Erin E. Clark first notified enrolled undergraduates to complete the training module by the end of the month. Those who failed to complete the module by that deadline received a reminder to do so by Oct. 13.
After the October deadline passed, the Title IX office shared the names of students who had yet to complete the training with their resident deans, who sent out another round of reminder emails. Merhill wrote that involving the resident deans was “consistent with past practices.”
In some of these notifications from resident deans, students were asked to complete the module “as soon as possible.” Adams House Resident Dean Charles E. Lockwood asked residents of his house to complete the module by Oct. 30.
“Students who do not complete the module by that time run the risk of having a hold placed on their account for spring term course registration,” Lockwood wrote in the email.
“The Title IX training is crucial so that we all have a shared understanding of the College's resources and policies, and so that we can all do our part to make Harvard a community free of sexual harassment and misconduct,” he added.
While it is unclear whether Harvard will grant students who continue to hold off on tackling the online training further extensions, Merhill wrote that her office will provide them “case-by-case” support.
“We are working with students on a case-by-case basis to support those students who have yet to complete the module,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen seniors were announced Friday as senior class marshals for the Class of 2021.
The marshals, who collectively comprise the Senior Class Committee, are tasked with organizing class-wide events up until Commencement in May. They also coordinate the Senior Gift fund and plan post-graduation reunion events.
This group of marshals will undertake a task unlike that of previous classes. With the pandemic displaying no clear end in sight, it is still unclear whether seniors will return to campus in the spring, let alone enjoy its usual pre-commencement events like the senior soirée, senior olympics, senior talent show, and the Last Chance Dance. Harvard has yet to announce which cohorts it will invite back to campus next semester.
After a two-round election last week, Samyra C. Miller ’21 and Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 were named First and Second Marshals, respectively.
Miller said she received the news Thursday morning right after Hurricane Zeta had hit her hometown of New Orleans and her house lost power.
“I was kind of laying in my bed and listening to this little emergency radio because it was the only thing that would work, listening to storm recovery updates on the radio, trying to find some way to pass the time,” she recounted. “Then I get a phone call and turn the radio down, and it's them telling me that I was the first marshal.”
Miller said she is excited to create long lasting connections for her class during their final semester at Harvard and future reunions.
“The final few semesters of our time at Harvard, we spent separated, and so I think that will play a crucial role, especially down the line, when having those reunions,” she said. “We might have some big turnout simply because we weren't able to kind of be all together for those last times.”
Kumar acknowledged that the pandemic and social distancing guidelines would inevitably reshape the canonical senior week, which usually involves a number of large, indoor gatherings.
“How do we use our amazing people to create the sense of community for other people who don't feel part of the community as much right now? Or if you didn't feel like Harvard was the best four years of your life?” he said. “We're catering to everyone.”
“I'm sure we can figure out ways to host more outdoor events or more socially distanced and fun events around campus,” Kumar added.“There'll be ways to break down the larger class of 2021 community into smaller groups.”
Christopher M. Altizer ’21, one of the six Program Marshals, said he is confident that the senior class can celebrate itself and its accomplishments this spring, even within the restrictions imposed by coronavirus. The program marshals are people who place third through eighth in the election process.
“I really enjoy putting on events that are inclusive and exciting for students,” he said. “I'm also excited to really just be trying to embody that spirit of the senior class that I know is there, but that might be a little quiet now because of the pandemic.”
In addition to the Program Marshals, six seniors were appointed Gift Marshals by the Harvard College Fund after they underwent an application and interview process.
Lin Zhu ’21, one of these Gift Marshals, said she is eager to help spearhead the senior gift campaign during this “unique and challenging time.”
“The senior gift really goes to support many different clubs and student activities. And I think during this time with Covid and the pandemic, it makes it so important that these clubs do have funding so when students do come back, they are able to have these really enriching and fulfilling experiences,” she said. “It makes a direct impact.”
In the coming weeks, the class marshals will work on interviewing and selecting the remainder of the committee: the secretary, treasurer, media team, and house representatives.
Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21, a Program Marshal, said despite the uncertainty of the upcoming semester, she is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with the rest of the committee to serve their class.
“I think it's hard for any of us to know what's next and how we're going to form this community, especially virtually, probably the most atypical time last century,” she said. “My personal focus is to build and bolster a sense of community at a time when this community feels so awfully hard to come by and just to remind people that for the rest of our lives, community will exist and persist through all of this.”
The full list of seniors selected as members of the Senior Class Committee is below:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a meeting on Monday night, the City Council discussed motions to reduce or limit campaign donations from donors seeking money from the city and to ban the use of tear gas in Cambridge.
The City Council voted to refer two policy orders to the Ordinance Committee to cap campaign donations from donors seeking financial reward from the city. This proposed ordinance would include potential donors who are trying to enter into a contract with the city, seeking approval for a special permit or up-zoning, seeking to acquire real estate from the city, or seeking financial assistance from the city.
The motions aim to combat the “perceived influence of money in politics” and “to put the onus of campaign contribution accountability on potential donors and not target individual elected officials.”
The City Council also discussed the history of tear gas use in the city, voting on an official policy order to prohibit its use in Cambridge.
While the initial amendment to ban tear gas included language which stated it had not been used in Cambridge for more than 30 years, Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler voiced concerns during the meeting about passing the motion as originally worded because of the potential for “glossing over” the historic use of tear gas in the city.
“There are Cambridge residents living here today that were tear-gassed,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
As a result, the Council voted to adopt a follow-up amendment proposed by Sobrinho-Wheeler which added clarifying language acknowledging the previous use of tear gas by the Cambridge Police Department on city residents protesting for racial justice.
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale and Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob also provided updates on measures taken by the city to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, with Jacob stating that he believes Cambridge is “as well-positioned as any city to adjust to the next era of COVID.”
But Councillor Quinton Y. Zondervan warned Cambridge needs to be “careful about how well we’re doing when in fact our case load is increasing,” when examined in the context of the Commonwealth writ large.
“I also think we need to be careful not to victim blame,” Zondervan said. “It seems to be more because a lot of people, including black and brown communities, are facing difficult living and working conditions, that they are facing increased risk of getting COVID.”
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon added she believes the city should encourage residents to get tested, whether or not they are symptomatic, now that the city has increased testing capabilities.
“We have plenty of testing,” Mallon said. “I think even just communicating that to the residents so they don’t continue to wonder ‘if I get a test, am I taking an appointment away from someone who really needs it,’ because I think that has been where we have been, right? There have been a limited amount of tests, so people haven’t wanted to go.”
The City Council meeting — which was conducted through Zoom — grappled with its fair share of technical issues, including concerns about audio quality during the proposal of amendments and temporary lost connections from the meeting.
Another topic of discussion was a motion to increase the fee for a resident parking permit from $25 to $40. The motion ultimately failed 4-5.
“I have a saying I have often used where I say that we should applaud our accomplishments and critique our shortcomings, and this is one of the times I am going to critique,” Councillor Marc C. McGovern said. “I would rather that we had means testing and exempted low-income people and you made people like me pay $50 instead of $40, if that made up the money.”
“When we talked about this two years ago, we talked about increasing the amount as a way of discouraging people from owning cars; $40 is not going to do that. I think this is strictly about revenue,” McGovern added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council passed legislation on Sunday to sponsor a low-cost winter and summer storage program for students currently living on campus.
The legislation will allocate $30,000 for winter and summer storage in a partnership with Five Star Movers, a Boston-area moving company.
The UC will select 500 students for the program, with preference to those eligible for the Student Events Fund, a College initiative that provides event tickets to undergraduates with demonstrated financial need, as well as based on distance from campus and on a first-come-first-serve basis.
Sunday’s legislation comes after what Council members described as a successful partnership with the company in summer 2019, during which the UC rented a warehouse to store the belongings of 500 students for $15 each.
Following students’ departure from campus in March, the College partnered with Olympia Moving and Storage, offering all students receiving financial aid a $200 subsidy for storing their belongings. Many other students, though, had to pay hundreds of dollars to store their belongings.
Five Star Movers offers a better and cheaper option in many respects, according to representatives sponsoring the legislation.
For instance, they said that the UC’s experience in 2019 with Five Star Movers was “incredibly reliable,” in contrast to the complaints from students of financial and logistical hurdles faced in retrieving their belongings from Olympia. They acknowledged some drawbacks, though, such as lack of insurance options and inability to return storage boxes directly to students’ dorm rooms.
For the new program, elected students will pay $5 per box for the winter storage program, which will be reserved for students likely to return for the Spring 2021 semester. Students planning to store their belongings until fall 2021 will pay $10 per box, according to the legislation.
Dropoff for UC storage will take place on Nov. 18, four days before students leave campus for the Thanksgiving holiday and the remainder of the semester. Students returning to campus for the Spring 2021 semester will pick up their boxes on Jan. 23.
The UC hopes that costs for students living on campus next semester will be lower since many will likely be seniors, who will not be in need of summer storage.
In response to concerns that Harvard has not yet finalized its plans for the Spring 2021 semester, sponsors of the legislation assured students that the program’s timeline is adjustable.
“Five Star Movers has proven to be a flexible and understanding partner and they have assured us they will work with us, no matter the situation,” Swanson, Zhang, and Harris wrote.
“Students who are on campus in the fall but do not yet know whether they will return in the spring should err on the side of caution, and store their items until the summer,” they added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Artists and activists highlighted the role of creative expression in telling stories and fostering empathy at a webinar Monday hosted by the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Harvard University Common Spaces.
The artist evrYwhr set the tone of the event with a recording of his song “Letter to the White House,” which lays out his vision for national unity. The discussion which followed — moderated by HGSE Director of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Tracie D. Jones —featured actor and singer Dyllón Burnside, chief executive officer of Pathways to Creative Industries Joiselle Cunningham, and hip-hop dancer and HGSE lecturer Aysha Upchurch.
Panelists agreed that art deepens people’s understanding of themselves and each other. Through their work, Burnside said artists can encourage people to pursue meaningful change.
“I think it starts with the self,” Burnside said. “It starts with understanding who we are as individuals, and what we bring to the table. And as we engage with the world and have different realizations, how do we share that with folks in a way that allows them to connect to their humanity in a way that creates change?”
Upchurch said dance can empower members of historically discriminated groups, specifically Black women, to “reclaim and rightfully write the narratives around our bodies, our moving bodies, our still bodies.”
“I don’t consider myself an activist,” Upchurch added. “But I do understand that my work sits in advocacy, it sits in helping folks understand their own voice.”
Cunningham said her organization, Pathways to Creative Industries, equips young people with the confidence to realize their artistic passions.
“A lot of our work is trying to really make sure that the adults in their lives really have the tools to cultivate that greatness, and affirm it,” she said. “Also, that there are systems in place to really support them in their dreams.”
Like many other industries, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the arts world. The pandemic has forced artists to rethink their relationship with their craft, panelists said.
During the event, Burnside shared his music video “Silence,” which he filmed during quarantine. Burnside said the filming process helped remind him of the value of self-awareness.
“That’s the inspiration for the song and the video — just encouraging people to really be okay with the silence and be okay with stillness and realize that the true magic of their lives is found in the silence,” he said.
In the face of a global pandemic, recession, and racial reckoning, panelists said they believe art can bring people together.
In an interview preceding the event, evrYwhr said artists can share their personal purpose with others through their work.
“My understanding is, world peace comes from individual peace. It’s just individual peace, magnified — being able to take the message for yourself, and to live with conviction and accountability in the spaces that you believe you need to hold high and true,” he said.
Following the discussion, Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson concluded the event by relating art to current movements for racial justice.
“We’ll only get to justice and freedom if we’re able to talk about it, if we’re able to dream it — we always say that you can’t fight for something you can’t imagine. And the work of art is fundamentally the work of imagination,” he said.

Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony S. Fauci and medical anthropologists Jim Y. Kim and Paul Farmer, a professor at the Medical School, discussed the social, political, and public health dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic in a panel moderated by HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82 Monday.
Setting aside the scientific aspects of the novel coronavirus, Daley led a discussion on a series of fundamental questions, which he said were aimed at addressing the “systemic forces at play” that have shaped the trajectory of the pandemic.
“I fear that in our reckless race for the next biomedical silver bullet from cure to drug to life-saving vaccine, we risk losing sight of the systemic forces at play,” Daley said. “Without [these] we cannot learn the lessons in the future that will allow us to avert another similar disaster.”
Among these systemic forces, the panelists focused on understanding the societal and political motivation behind the United States’s pandemic response.
Fauci said the lack of a unified response across the U.S. has contributed to its inability to fully contain the virus.
“I think one of the issues that we have in this country is that there is a beauty to the individual independence of states doing the things that they want to do,” Fauci said. “It's a very important part of our country, but sometimes when you have an outbreak, which involves the entire nation, you really have to pull together in a uniform manner.”
“That's something that we didn't see as much as we would have liked early on,” he added.
Kim said the lack of a collective response has also resulted in inadequate emphasis on and funding for safety and containment measures including social distancing with masks, testing, contact tracing, and patient care. Kim said business leaders he spoke with were more interested in waiting for vaccines and therapeutics as compared to funding public health efforts.
“I do not think they understand — these business leaders — how difficult it is, even when we get a vaccine or better therapeutics, to deal with this particular virus,” Kim said. “We still have not emerged from the magical thinking which says, ‘once we get a vaccine, this is over.’”
This approach contrasts with the successes of Asian countries, including China and South Korea, which have contained the virus through rigorous contact tracing and public health measures rather than concentrating efforts on vaccine development, Kim said.
“The only places where the economy is recovering is where they have the full public health response — they're chasing down every single case,” Kim said. “There's a sense that we don't need to do that in the United States because we'll have a vaccine and treatment.”
While the herd immunity gained from a vaccine is key to ending the pandemic, public safety precautions including social distancing and mask wearing should still remain in place, according to Fauci.
“No matter how sophisticated we get with our technologies, with our better platforms for vaccines, with our targeted antiviral drugs — a core, good public health system is so important,” Fauci said.
Still, Fauci said he was hopeful the prospect of a vaccine will incentivize people to follow public health guidelines, as scientists and the public closely await results of five vaccine candidates in phase-three clinical trials.
“I believe the idea that a vaccine is on the horizon is going to be playing a major, major role in how people accept the continuation of the stringent public health restrictions that they have,” Fauci said. “If they don't see any relief in sight, that may be really difficult for them to just swallow it and say, ‘Oh my goodness, when is this going to end?’”
Farmer emphasized that preparing for the administration of vaccines will be crucial, including relying on local individuals to mitigate mistrust and miscommunication about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.
“There's a good chance that we can prepare communities for and enlist the support of communities in rolling out this vaccine and other preventives in therapeutics,” Farmer said. “Seeing this on the horizon — that and therapeutics — may help us in promoting the importance of the other tried and true measures such as social distancing and mask wearing.”
To address the mistrust surrounding vaccinations, Fauci said it is key to communicate to the public that vaccine production happens in a “firm” process.
“It's time-honored and it's transparent, because all the data ultimately is going to be made available,” Fauci said. “I think any attempt at circumventing the process is going to be so apparent that it just won't happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Governor Charlie D. Baker '79 announced a number of initiatives to respond to rising coronavirus cases in Massachusetts, including a stay-at-home advisory, a mandate on mask-wearing in public spaces, and a curfew on restaurant service.
Monday’s announcement comes as Massachusetts grapples with a recent spike in COVID-19 cases. The state reported 1,139 new cases and 22 new deaths on Sunday.
Baker announced a stay-at-home advisory that will remain in effect from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. Residents are advised to stay at home other than to go on walks, go to work, or go to the grocery store.
Baker also announced a more stringent mandate on mask-wearing. The new policy stipulates that everyone over the age of 5 is required to wear a mask in public spaces. Baker had previously encouraged residents to wear masks only in situations where social distancing was not possible.
Baker also announced a cap on indoor gatherings at 10 people and a cap on outdoor gatherings at 25 people.
Restaurants will be required to stop serving seated customers at 9:30 p.m., but can continue providing takeout after that time.
Sharleen Y. Loh '22, an inactive Crimson multimedia editor who is living on campus this semester, wrote in an email that she wasn’t particularly concerned by the newly-announced restrictions on restaurants.
“For the most part, the new curfew hasn't impacted me personally all too much, as I don't leave my room too often & most places are closed by 10 pm,” Loh wrote.
Lucy Frucht '22, who is living in an apartment with friends in the area for the academic year, wrote in an email that she had only eaten at restaurants “a few times” this semester. Frucht wrote that she had been attending an exercise class indoors, following coronavirus safety precautions. She noted that the new restrictions on indoor gatherings could force the class to restrict attendance.
Nonetheless, Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the 9:30 curfew could have a significant impact on restaurants already struggling with the economic consequences of the pandemic.
Jillson said many business owners were frustrated by the new policy after implementing previous public health guidelines from the state.
“I think the frustration that some of the restaurateurs expressed is that the guidelines come out, they adhere to the guidelines, everything works the way it should,” Jillson said. “And because other communities are experiencing a surge in cases, Cambridge, along with all the other communities that are doing well, effectively pays the price.”
Jillson added that the recommendations could cause some restaurants to close early for the fall season.
The new policies will take effect at midnight on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few things at Harvard have felt more salient than the 2020 election. With countless John F. Kennedy Jr. Forums, dining hall debates, and organizing pushes, it’s dominated discussions on campus — and Zoom — for over a year.
But even faculty and students who have dedicated endless time and energy to delegate math, paths to 270, and organizing never could have imagined the pandemic-stricken spectacle that is Election Day 2020.
With students scattered around the globe, the thought of packed crowds across campus watching returns come in on TV seems almost wistful. Whatever comes next, students will be experiencing it largely by themselves, leaving many with angst and apprehension in the final hours before polls close.
So, what will come next?
Buckle up — it could be a bumpy ride. Polling places, including Harvard’s Gund Hall, will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. in Cambridge on Tuesday.
Donald J. Trump’s presidency has been marked by protest and repudiation at Harvard. The president has remained deeply unpopular among students and faculty alike, and Harvard’s administration has publicly opposed many of Trump’s immigration policies, even going to court to reverse one.
Harvard’s majority-liberal student body was largely split over who to support during the Democratic primaries. But since former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. clinched the Democratic nomination, students have broadly rallied behind him.
A September survey conducted by The Crimson found 89 percent of students who were planning to vote planned to cast a ballot for Biden, with a mere 1.2 percent of respondents identifying as undecided.
There have, however, been notable exceptions. In a striking reversal from its 2016 stance, the Harvard Republican Club endorsed Trump after the first presidential debate, pointing to his “marquee accomplishments” on issues such as tax reform and foreign policy.
The timeline of when a projection will be made in the presidential race remains clouded in uncertainty, leaving students with a potentially long week ahead.
Biden leads Trump in polling averages in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin — all of which the president carried in 2016. If Biden carries all three states — as former President Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012 — and holds on to every state won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, he will win the presidency.
Biden and Trump are polling neck-and-neck in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Texas — all traditionally red states that the Democrats have made a play for in 2020.
Trump is counting on high turnout in rural parts of the swing states, which helped catapult him to victory in 2016. Notably, Trump has insisted that a winner be declared on election night, sparking concern that he could try to declare victory before the results warrant it.
No states report finalized results on election night. News organizations are typically able to make a projection based on available returns and other modeling. Projections may be delayed, however, if the election comes down to a close race in a state such as Pennsylvania, which does not allow local election officials to process ballots ahead of Election Day, even as Americans are voting by mail in record numbers. Mail-in votes take longer to process.
The once-closely-watched Massachusetts U.S. Senate race has largely fallen from the front pages since September 1, when incumbent U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) downed U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) after a contentious Democratic primary.
Still riding high after becoming the first person to ever defeat a Kennedy in Massachusetts, Markey is expected to cruise to re-election. A pair of polls conducted in October showed Markey with a whopping 30-plus point advantage over his Republican challenger, lawyer Kevin O’Connor.
Massachusetts voters are hardly averse to electing Republicans. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, a Republican who is backing O’Connor, holds one of the highest approval ratings in the country. And the state elected Republican Scott Brown to the Senate in a 2010 special election following the death of Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56.
O’Connor has been heavily outraised by Markey, though, and his support for Trump in a state that broadly disapproves of the president leaves the Republican with a steep uphill battle.
U.S. Representative Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.) — who has represented Massachusetts’ Fifth Congressional District, which includes parts of Cambridge, since 2013 — faces Republican Caroline Colarusso in the general election.
Clark, who trounced her GOP opponent with over 70 percent of the vote in 2018, is running to become the Assistant Speaker of the U.S. House. Clark has worked behind the scenes to fundraise and recruit Democratic House candidates, becoming a prominent player within her caucus.
Colarusso, a Stoneham Selectwoman who supports President Trump, described herself to the Boston Herald as “law and order constitutionalist.”
U.S. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.), who represents part of Cambridge in the Seventh Congressional District, faces an independent challenger, Roy Owens, in her first election as an incumbent.
In deep blue Cambridge, all eight Democratic candidates for the Massachusetts State Legislature are unopposed.
Incumbent State Senators Sal N. DiDomenico, Joseph A. Boncore, and Patricia D. Jehlen will coast to re-election. Jehlen easily survived a primary challenge in September.
Cambridge will send one newcomer to the House, Steven Owens, who won a three-way Democratic primary to replace outgoing State Representative Jonathan Hecht.
State Representatives David M. Rogers, Marjorie C. Decker, Mike Connolly, Jay D. Livingstone will all be re-elected without competition.
Massachusetts voters will also weigh in on a pair of ballot initiatives Tuesday.
Question No. 1 on the ballot, the right-to-repair measure, would allow motor vehicle owners and independent repair shops to have expanded access to mechanical data. Proponents say it will allow car owners greater autonomy in choosing where they get their car fixed. The fight over the right-to-repair measure has become the most expensive ballot initiative in Massachusetts history, with over $43 million spent.
The second ballot measure would enact a ranked-choice voting system under which citizens would rank candidates in order of preference in elections for statewide, state legislative, and congressional offices. Numerous Harvard faculty members — including Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, and former University President Lawrence H. Summers — have come out in support of the ranked-choice voting measure.

Stressed about the election? Me too. It’s both sad and funny how amid all the madness of 2020, the wildest stories are still about the 2020 presidential election. While I’m sure we all can’t wait to get this over with, unfortunately, we probably won’t find out who’s gonna be America’s Next Top Mod — I mean, America’s Next President on Tuesday night. So instead of going out of our minds stressing out about the fate of this country, here’s a list of relaxing-ish things that Harvard students can do while waiting for the election result.
Listen to Samyra’s Podcasts
With the virtual semester and everything else happening in 2020, it’s so easy to forget that Harvard still exists. No better time to catch up than now. Let me introduce you to the go-to news source for all of Harvard’s hottest tea: the amazing Samyra C. Miller ’21 and her awesome podcast series, The Harvard Communitea. Since reading the news nowadays makes us all want to cry, at least listening to The Harvard Communitea will make you feel like you’re ~connected~ to what’s going on without feeling sad. And if you’re craving even more podcasts to fill the void, the Crimson’s got you covered.
Rewatch Housing Day Videos
For first years, previous years’ Housing Day videos might be our only glimpse into the various upperclassmen communities at Harvard. Why obsessively check the news every 30 seconds when you can get lost in the beautiful views of Lowell House or the iconic “We Didn’t Start The Kirkland” tune from Kirkland House’s 2014 video? We have no idea what Housing Day will look like this year, but it’s never too early to start falling in love with the river houses only to get quadded in the spring! Check out these playlists from 2020 and 2017 for some of the best to get you started.
Finally Work On Those Math Psets
What better way to get your mind off a frustrating and depressing presidential election than to be stressed out by a frustrating and depressing math pset? Just half an hour with derivatives and linear algebra can make all your anxiety about the election disappear. Sure, there will be tears — but hey, at least they won’t be because of politics.
*Mom Voice* Clean Your Room
Midterm season recently ended, and if you’re like me, your room has really fallen into a state of messiness. With only a month until move-out for folks on campus, it’s wise to pick up a broom and start sweeping away. While you’re contemplating how on earth you let yourself stay in such a messy place, you won’t have time to worry for the millionth time about who’s gonna win your home state.
Binge Your Comfort Show
Sometimes all you need is a warm blanket, tea, and the joy of rewatching your favorite show for the 17th time. Usually, ignoring your approaching deadlines for essays and psets is probably frowned upon, but given the hecticness of the upcoming days, I think you’re allowed some exceptions. Why stress about the fact that it might take days, even weeks, to get the result back when you can laugh at the ridiculous plot twists in “Riverdale” and wonder how drunk the writers were when they wrote this scene?
Take Naps
Do you know what you’re not going to think about when you’re off to dreamland? The election! Since we’re all perpetually sleep-deprived anyway, we might as well take advantage of election night and sleep our troubles away, at least for a short while.
No matter what happens on Tuesday night, or however long it takes for the 2020 Presidential Election to be over, remember to prioritize your mental wellbeing and do things that make you happy :)
