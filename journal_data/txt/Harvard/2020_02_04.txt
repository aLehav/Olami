After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Contemporary pop often seems little more than a blissfully uniform influx of silky voices and sparkly costumes, delivered by stars with superhuman self-assurance. The ensuing effect on the senses is at once dulling and overwhelming.
Enter Halsey. Born Ashley Frangipane, the American singer got her start on social media and skyrocketed to chart-topping fame. Her third studio album tears apart the gilded veneer of pop perfection to expose a visceral, bracing authenticity, all while retaining traces of the sleek sound she once embraced. Out of tension and turbulence, “Manic” forges a fleeting portrait of an artist in metamorphosis: capricious and vulnerable but no less of a creative force.
Halsey doesn’t mince words. The album’s first track, “Ashley,” delves headlong into her complex self-image, especially the liminal space between her personal and performative identities. During a Jan. 16 Spotify takeover, Halsey discussed the ancient Japanese belief that each person has three faces: one they show to the world, another for close friends and family, and an entirely private face which, according to Halsey, “exists in the cracks between the two.” Halsey equates the first two with her stage and given names, respectively. With “Manic,” she hopes to offer listeners a “glimpse of that third face.” A confessional, halting introduction to the emotional upheaval to come, “Ashley” reveals the inner workings of an artistic identity crisis. As the song begins, Halsey quietly comes to terms with the autonomy of her choices over a steady foundation of synths and snare drums. “Took my heart and sold it out to a vision that I wrote myself,” she sings, possibly referring to a sense that she’s neglected her true self in favor of her fabricated alter ego. With the line “Someday, someday, when I burst into flames,” Halsey’s voice does exactly that, the background synths rising to match its newfound resonance. At the beginning of the next verse, she reverts to a rhythmic murmur just as abruptly.
As the backing track fades out, “Ashley” ends on a Kate Winslet quote from “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” one of Halsey’s self-professed favorite films. It’s a fitting segue into the album’s next song: “clementine,” inspired by Winslet’s performance in the sci-fi romance. Understated and lyrical with a lilting keyboard motif, “clementine” pays tribute to a film of deep personal significance for Halsey. “I basically built my whole personality off of [the character] Clementine,” she said in an interview with Rolling Stone.
Unlike the preceding synth-powered tracks, the intro to “Graveyard” features a mellow acoustic guitar riff, which beautifully accompanies Halsey’s torn opinions on the appeal of an unhealthy relationship: “It’s crazy when / The thing you love the most is the detriment.” But the novelty is short-lived — synths creep into the pre-chorus and eventually replace the guitar altogether. The new instrumentation lends the song momentum, but at the expense of its prior simplicity. When the next song, “You should be sad,” undergoes the same shift, déjà vu sets in. Though not quite convincing, the deliberate timing of the changes lays bare the jarring contrast between the bubbly electropop beats and Halsey’s dismal lyrics.
As a recurring musical element, Halsey’s heavy reliance on synths creates an ambiguous atmosphere, tempering the raw emotion in her voice. The album’s true unifying factor lies in its lyrical themes of transformation and self-discovery. Throughout the album, she provides nuanced commentary on different aspects of love and does not hesitate to acknowledge her own shortcomings. Even as Halsey delivers the most pointed jabs at her exes on “You should be sad” — “And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars / I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you” — she ultimately turns to reflection over anger, amplifying the honesty of her claims. “Got no anger, got no malice / Just a little bit of regret,” she sings in the first verse. Several tracks explore the limits of codependency, such as “Without Me,” the album’s lead single and Halsey’s first solo track to top the Hot 100. As Halsey grapples with the magnetism of a manipulative and ungrateful ex, her voice soars and echoes to an infectious power-ballad beat. Her searching repetitions of the phrase “I don’t know why,” in reference to her futile attempts to save her relationship, further emphasize the depth of her sadness and confusion.
“I cried the whole time I recorded it,” Halsey tweeted about “Without Me.” “But now I feel proud. And empowered.” And with good reason — for an artist whose previous albums revolved around the construction of elaborate fictional universes, the unfiltered candor of “Manic” marks an impressive step into new creative territory. Halsey describes the album’s diverse features — rapper Dominic Fike, alt-rocker Alanis Morissette, and K-pop star Suga — as “people who really represent different parts of my psyche.”
On the album cover, Halsey sports a striking blur of blue eyeshadow on one eyelid. Against a background of muted pastels, the iridescent pigment becomes the image’s focal point. From her initial concept of a black eye and its association with trauma, Halsey chose to create a “badge of honor” out of the bruise by rendering it in glitter — commemorating her inner strength instead of hiding her struggles. With verve and audacity to match her vibrant makeup, “Manic” showcases Halsey’s ability to create order from chaos, hope from loss, and beauty from pain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are now fully immersed in election season with the 2020 presidential election just a few short months away and primaries fully underway. It is, thus, an apt time to revisit one of the great injustices of the American electoral system, which is the mistreatment and disenfranchisement of the massive prison population in our country.
Senator Bernie Sanders is currently the only presidential candidate calling for granting all incarcerated Americans the right to vote. Yet, not only do incarcerated Americans lack the right to vote but their bodies are often used to further the agendas of those responsible for the growth of the modern carceral state.
Incarcerated Americans are counted in the districts where they are imprisoned and not in the districts where they are registered to vote. This fundamentally undemocratic policy has detrimental consequences on those whose votes are exploited. Either prisoners should be granted the right to vote — which I believe is the right thing to do — or they should not be counted for apportionment. It is immoral and undemocratic to count those who are denied the right to vote as citizens for district apportionment.
Elected officials are meant to serve their constituents and the public. The only mechanism by which constituents are able to ensure that their representatives are truly serving their interests is by voting them out. However, individuals who are counted in districts where they cannot vote do not have this ability. In fact, they are often served by representatives who advocate positions diametrically opposed to their own.
Imagine a district that includes a massive prison system run by a for-profit private prison corporation. In such a district the only voters would be the employees of the prison and of the corporation imprisoning the overwhelming majority of the district’s residents. The profiteers of the prisons would elect someone intended to represent the prisoners themselves. Yet clearly those voting would have drastically different interests to those whom the representative is meant to represent.
This is not just a hypothetical; in smaller districts, this is reality. In Anamosa, Iowa, a district with a massive prisoner population, only 58 people vote, despite there being 1,400 census-recorded residents. This means each voter in Anamosa has about 25 times more political clout than the typical American voter.
Allowing these districts with large prison populations to count their prisoners for political representation is the modern-day equivalent of the Three-Fifths Compromise. Though it is often rightfully lamented that slaves were only counted as three-fifths of a person, it is important to recall that it was the abolitionists who argued that slaves should not be counted in congressional apportionment and it was the slaveholders who pushed to count them.
Southerners wanted slaves to count so that they could inflate their representation in Congress. It was deemed unfair to count them as full people so they were only considered three-fifths of their white counterparts. We consider this to be incredibly heinous yet say nothing about the apportionment of the incarcerated who count as full people for purposes of allotting representation. In 1790, there were 700,000 slaves in America. None of them had the right to vote, yet three-fifths of them also had their votes stolen a second time because they were still counted in district apportionment. As of 2013, there were 2,220,300 incarcerated adults. Similarly, they do not have the right to vote, yet every single one of them has their vote stolen when they are counted in district apportionment. Just as the slaves were then represented by their slaveholders, prisoners today are often represented by the authors of the policies responsible for sending them to prison.
A manifestation of this problem that hits closer to home, albeit much less seriously, is that college students, too, are counted in districts in which they largely do not vote and often are served by politicians with interests very different from their own. We may take advantage of the incredibly progressive Cambridge, yet some schools with just as large a liberal student body are surrounded by conservative voters and politicians. And by counting the students as residents of those districts, they are exploited to advance an agenda that they do not have the power to resist.
Issues of district apportionment and who counts as being represented might not be as exciting as prison divestment or sentencing reform, but they are nonetheless critical to treating incarcerated people fairly and for our democracy to function properly. As we progress into election season and people continue to debate whom to vote for, it is important to remember that the system is rigged against those behind bars; they are unfairly barred from voting and deliberately misrepresented.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, University Professor Charles M. Lieber was charged in federal court for “making materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements” to U.S. government agencies. The lawsuit filed by the federal government claims that Lieber, who has since been placed on “indefinite” paid administrative leave, signed contracts beginning in 2011 to participate in China’s Thousand Talents Plan for personal financial gain.
But the issue at stake is larger than a professor hiding funding or personally receiving illegal payments for research — the TTP isn’t any old foreign entity. Established in 2008 by the Chinese government to bring in scientists from around the world, it has been deemed by the U.S. government to be a danger to national security. It’s not an isolated incident either. The Chinese government has been conducting a broader program of academic espionage against the U.S. and its research institutions. This espionage has most notably included attempts to insert Chinese scholars into research programs dealing with sensitive information.
Supplying sensitive information in this context is an especially grave offense given the Chinese government’s past record as an unethical actor. It’s not just intellectual property theft; the Chinese government has displayed political and military recklessness in the South China Sea and has gone so far as to perpetrate the internment and “re-education” of the Uighur ethnic group.
Lieber’s alleged acts run contrary to the spirit of our University and warrant clear denunciation — something Harvard has not explicitly or publicly offered. He not only undermines his own academic and civic integrity, but draws into question that of the University and scientific research more broadly. But given this broader context, Lieber’s case must be the beginning of a broader process of reflection.
Harvard must seek to carefully balance its first principles of open cultural exchange and the pursuit of knowledge, while also making sure that it has adequately safeguarded against similar cases. To that end and in response to the FBI and NIH launching national investigations into academic espionage this past year, Harvard has established two new oversight committees dedicated to reviewing sensitive research projects. But we ask still more. Harvard must not only address the actions and susceptibilities of its affiliates but its own institutional ties to a regime whose abuses go far beyond intellectual property theft. As we have previously opined, in cases where Harvard holds financial ties to ethically dubious regimes, the University must seriously consider the extent to which it serves to legitimize these actors and their abuses.
Yet still more broadly, we must ask what systemic factors have allowed the Chinese government to take advantage of American research institutions. After all, as of November, more than 70 research institutions were investigating potential cases of academic espionage, almost all of which involved Chinese researchers and scholars. It would seem that the increasing presence of
Chinese researchers and funding at U.S. institutions is partially being driven by the insufficient number of American-born scientists the U.S. produces. Perhaps one silver lining of the Lieber case will be increased consciousness about our own national deficiencies in this field.
While Harvard must condemn and combat China’s academic espionage, it is critical that the rhetoric denouncing the Chinese state and its actions does not devolve into blanket criticism or stereotyping of Chinese people. Chinese citizens are neither personally responsible for their government’s actions, nor do these individuals necessarily support them. Any totalizing Cold War rhetoric that attempts to erase this distinction would be not only morally reprehensible, but would also undermine the open pursuit of knowledge and innovation Harvard is supposed to champion. We must make a conscious effort to combat rhetoric and attitudes that generalize along racial or ethnic lines and which impede vital intellectual exchange.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here’s the moment I began to hate my body: I am twelve years old, standing next to one of my friends in front of the mirror in the locker room after track practice. She, like the other girls in our school who were routinely called beautiful, was stick-thin. Comparing the size of our thighs, I realized that I was not. Suddenly, I became convinced that my physical form was inferior to hers; my legs began to seem like a personal failing. From there, I undertook the project of correcting what I saw as wrong with my body; mainly, that I wasn’t medically underweight.
Food, instead of something to enjoy, became a collection of macronutrients. In some ways, this line of thinking had already been drilled into me by my mother, a registered dietician. However, her well-meaning advice about eating a balanced diet had been twisted by my own self-loathing into something much more sinister; a bowl of chocolate ice cream was now reduced to 30 grams of sugar, 14 grams of fat, and more calories than I wanted to think about. And if I ate that bowl of ice cream, it would mean almost overwhelming guilt; I had poisoned my body, and there would be consequences.
By the time I had entered high school, this way of viewing food had been reinforced by years of exposure to online dieting culture. My Instagram feed was filled with references to “clean eating”, my YouTube recommendations were filled with videos titled “what I eat in a day”, and “how I lost 20 pounds in 6 months”. I was obsessed with eating a diet free from any “unclean” foods, convinced that if I were just a little skinnier, I would finally be worthy.
For the most part, my efforts were applauded. After all, there’s nothing visibly wrong with someone who regularly eats salad, so it took me too long to realize the truth: I had an unhealthy relationship with food.
At the time, “unhealthy” was probably the last word people would have used to describe me; I was known for eating healthily. This image was heavily reinforced by the presence of my mother, who frequently gave nutrition talks at my high school. Outwardly, I was a role-model. Internally, I felt awful, all the time. When I was particularly stressed, I starved myself.
Eating disorders are a disease; to be afflicted with one is to have caught a contagion, and the virus is everywhere. Current media messaging tells us eating a balanced diet is the way to nirvana; our supermarket checkout aisles are stocked with magazines filled with tips for eating better (read: losing weight) from beautiful (read: skinny) celebrities.
I see the symptoms of the illness in my friends all the time: passing out after eating only half a salad the entire day, or taking punishingly long runs in order to lose an invisible amount of weight. Ironically, if divorced from context, a lot of the things these girls do would be viewed positively, perhaps even as self-care. This only underscores that our ideas of what being “healthy” looks like can obscure what is actually self-harm.
These narratives pretend to promote a “healthy lifestyle”, but are almost always actually about weighing less. Behaviors that are clearly harmful (drug addiction, intermittent fasting that borders on starvation, bizarre “cleanses”) are tolerated, so long as the person doing them fits a physical mold. Case in point: The periods when I was most unkind to my body — and when, as a result, I was the thinnest — were also the times when I received the most compliments. My physical and mental health were always secondary to how I looked.
I wish I could tell you that I educated myself on the body-positivity movement, or went to see a therapist, or did some other kind of personal work, and that’s how I got better. But that wouldn’t be true. I no longer skip meals, and for the most part, I’m much happier with my body. Still, I think there might always be a part of me ready to punish myself.
We are often encouraged to think about the food we eat. Americans, after all, have a junk food problem, and maybe a little more mindful eating would improve our health outcomes. But I would like to think about what I eat a little less, and I encourage others to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department is investigating a series of thefts that occurred in River Houses and Yard dorms over the weekend, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano announced in an email to University affiliates Monday.
HUPD officers responded to three separate reports of theft in Leverett House, 20 DeWolfe St., and Quincy House in the early hours of the Saturday morning, according to HUPD police logs. On Sunday, Harvard affiliates in Wigglesworth Hall reported three more incidents of overnight theft. The stolen items included Apple laptops, Canada Goose jackets, and several gold necklaces valued at more than a thousand dollars.
In three of the incidents, the burglar or burglars entered an occupied room, but residents “did not observe or have any contact with the offender(s),” Catalano wrote.
HUPD has not determined if the six incidents are connected, but detectives are actively investigating the situation, according to Catalano. He wrote that anyone with information about the thefts should contact the department.
Catalano and HUPD reminded students that while burglaries in occupied rooms are “very rare,” residents should take certain precautions to prevent theft.
“Residents should not prop interior or exterior doors at any time, hold an outside door open for strangers or allow strangers to ‘piggyback’ on their access card,” Catalano wrote. “Residents should keep their room doors locked at all times even when in the room or when going down the hall for only a few minutes.”
Catalano did not respond to a request for comment.
This incident comes a week after HUPD reported that more than $6,000 worth of electronics were stolen from the Dillon Fieldhouse in Allston, home to many varsity sports teams’ locker rooms, facilities, and coaches’ offices.
Numerous burglaries have been reported in freshman dorms and upperclassmen residences in recent years. Over a weekend in September 2016, ten laptops disappeared from Yard and River dorms. In September 2018, students reported that a suspect climbed through a first-floor window in Holworthy Hall and took laptops, wallets, and an iPad.
The Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee voted unanimously 11-0 in favor of installing security cameras outside dorms in 2016.
Roughly 90 laptops are stolen each year at Harvard University, according to the HUPD website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) has introduced a new bill which — if passed — could protect graduate student workers’ employee rights from a proposed National Labor Relations Board rule that would classify graduate student workers as non-employees, experts say.
Sanders introduced the bill to the Senate on Jan. 22. He said it would prohibit the NLRB from “enacting a proposed rule which would strip graduate student workers’ right to unionize” in a press release.
Sanders’s bill represents the continuation of H.R.5104 — the Respect Graduate Student Workers Act, which was initially proposed by United States Representative Mark W. Pocan (D-Wisc.) in Nov. 2019.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers won the right to unionize in 2018, but if the NLRB’s proposed rule were to be passed, there would be no legal requirement that the University should recognize that right.
William A. Herbert, the executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York, said the proposed rule would leave it to the University to decide whether or not to honor the union’s status.
“If there's no contract in place at Harvard with the graduate assistants, and the NLRB issues a rule that says that graduate systems are not covered under the National Labor Relations Act, then the university would have the discretion to say that they're not going to continue to recognize the union,” Herbert said.
He said regardless of the decision that the NLRB makes, whether a university chooses to honor its students’ right to unionize or not speaks to its moral values.
“Institutions that understand collective bargaining to be a form of workplace democracy probably will be more likely to engage in voluntary recognition,” Herbert added.
University of Oregon associate professor Gordon Lafer, who formerly served as a senior labor policy advisor for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor, wrote in an email to The Crimson that he believes the bill Sanders and Pocan have introduced is an appropriate response to the actions of the current NLRB.
“What Sanders' bill does is stop this ongoing game of political football with the labor rights of graduate students, by putting into law what every other authority has recognized, and what is the palpable reality of university life,” Lafer wrote.
Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV said that the NLRB has generally used rulemaking sparingly, and usually to “clarify ambiguity that exists in the current wall.”
“This would be the first instance of doctrinal reversal through rulemaking,” Gould said. “I think it's inappropriate and I think Senator Sanders and others are wise to attempt to stop this.”
Though the NLRB is likely to adopt this proposed rule, according to Gould, he said he thought that the Respect Graduate Student Workers Act is an effective response to how the NLRB has handled graduate students’ right to collective bargaining in the past.
“It would clearly give graduate students the right to organize and to bargain collectively — something that has been provided for by the National Labor Relations Act, but for which we have every indication that this board will try to take away from graduate students,” Gould said.
University spokesperson Jonathan Swain declined to comment on what effects the proposed NLRB rule would have on union negotiations. Swain referred to an earlier comment on the status of the HGSU-UAW negotiations, which said that the University is “currently reviewing the proposed rule to assess its implications.”
The proposed rule is open for a public comment period until Feb. 28, after which the NLRB will review comments and ultimately decide whether or not to adopt the proposed rule as a final rule.
Still, Gould said it’s “quite likely” that the NLRB will have a sufficient majority to adopt the rule.
“They're entirely predictable along ideological lines,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four women who have accused former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez of sexual misconduct criticized Harvard’s external review of the circumstances that enabled the misconduct during a panel Monday.
The women — former Government assistant professor Terry L. Karl, former Government Ph.D. candidate Suzanna E. Challen, former Government concentrator Nienke C. Grossman ’99, and former Government concentrator Charna E. Sherman ’80 — shared their experiences in a Government Department auditorium filled with more than 100 people.
They were joined by Harvard Law School student Sejal Singh and civil rights attorney Debra S. Katz, who represented Christine Blasey Ford after Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault in 2018.
In 2018, 18 women — including the four panelists — brought allegations of sexual misconduct against Domínguez spanning four decades.
Karl — whose allegations prompted the Chronicle of Higher Education investigation that first made public Domínguez’s misconduct public — said the panel marked her first return to Harvard’s campus in three and a half decades. She requested an “apology” from Harvard and a “confession” that the University failed to protect her and other women harassed by Domínguez.
Multiple panelists criticized Harvard’s continued promotion of Domínguez even as multiple people brought complaints about his behavior to its attention over the years.
Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay stripped Domínguez of his emeritus status and banned from campus following the conclusion of the Title IX investigation in May 2019. The same day, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that the University would initiate an external review of the circumstances that led to a failure to provide a safe work environment for Government department affiliates — a measure the women and graduate students in the department had called for since the allegations became public.
The four women met with the external review committee before Monday’s discussion. Grossman said during the panel that she feels there is a “worrisome lack of transparency” about the committee’s method and goals.
“Who are they meeting with? Are they considering best practices or research in designing their approach? What form will the findings take? Will they be public? Has Harvard committed to responding to these recommendations?” Grossman said. “Today we met with the external review committee, and they did not answer these questions.”
In a Sept. 6 email to Government professor Steven R. Levitsky, Bacow wrote that he charged the committee with using the Domínguez case to “frame the review,” rather than conducting a “re-investigation of the allegations” against Domínguez.
Sherman wrote in an email after the panel that, in her meeting with the committee, she “directly challenged” the premise that it would be able to accomplish its mission without a “full record of the past,” including re-examining complaints against Domínguez.
“I think it’s fair to say the Committee disagreed,” Sherman wrote.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the external review is “ongoing” and working to collect information through conversations and in writing.
“The committee and the University are committed to ensuring this review is a robust examination of factors that may undermine the ability to prevent or address incidents of sexual harassment and assault,” Swain wrote.
At the end of the panel, the women called on Harvard to adopt a third-party grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. The panel was co-hosted by the Government Graduate Student Association and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, which has made sexual harassment protections a central goal in its contract negotiations with the University.
The union has proposed that student workers be given an option to raise complaints through a union grievance procedure — a dispute resolution mechanism outside of internal Harvard channels that could eventually lead to third-party arbitration in some cases. The University, on the other hand, has insisted that these complaints be handled through Title IX and its Office for Dispute Resolution, and through internal discrimination procedures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council approved an order Monday night that could potentially lower the voting age for Cambridge’s municipal elections.
The council voted 7-2 in favor of forwarding home rule legislation to the Massachusetts State Legislature that would allow citizens aged 16 and older to vote in Cambridge elections for city council, school committee, and local ballot measures.
Currently, under Massachusetts state law, individuals must be 18 and older to vote in municipal elections.
The approval of the home rule petition Monday night marks the third time Cambridge has considered lowering the voting age for its municipal elections. Although the council struck down a 2001 effort to lower the voting age to 16 and 17, it passed two similar measures in 2002 and 2006. Both the 2002 and 2006 petitions, however, were not ultimately approved by the state legislature.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon acknowledged the petition’s unsuccessful past during Monday’s city council meeting.
“This isn't the first time this home rule legislation has left this building with a positive recommendation to the state legislature and not — unfortunately — gone anywhere,” Mallon said.
“But I do think that the tide is turning,” she added.
Mallon also said that over the past year a new civics curriculum in Massachusetts has encouraged high school students in Cambridge to engage with municipal elections.
“They held mock debates, they looked at all of our platforms, they wrote op-eds, they invited members in to have debates. They asked some really hard questions,” she said. “I would say that our young people were actually more involved and understood more who was running and what they stood for than a lot of people.”
Councilor Timothy J. Toomey said he was concerned the new legislation would present too drastic of a change to the current voting age.
“I certainly appreciate the activism and the passion of our young people and getting involved with this is so extremely important,” Toomey said. “But I do strongly feel that the minimum age to be able to cast a vote should be 17 and I will continue to support that.”
Councilor Toomey and Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 both voted against the petition, while Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, and Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler voted in favor.
Students who spoke during the meeting said the city needs to be more inclusive of youth voices.
Sydney Down, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin student and member of the Cambridge Youth Council, said the voting preferences of students — as demonstrated in her school’s mock election — did not line up with the actual results of the city’s recent school committee election.
“Through this and the subsequent unrest within the entirety of the community, it is evident that youth voice is not reflected enough,” Down said.
At the end of her comment, Down emphasized the benefits of including younger voices in city decisions.
“Lowering the voting age will only further support young people in being civically engaged and responsible citizens as they gain the ability to contribute to making our towns, cities, and states equitable and sustainable communities,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council is scheduled to hold its first general meeting of the semester on Sunday, Feb. 9 — later into the spring semester than in the past few years.
UC representative Alexa C. Jordan ’22 and secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 said they raised questions about the scheduling of the first meeting with newly elected UC president James A. Mathew ’21 and vice president Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21.
Jordan said she and her colleagues found the process of scheduling the meeting confusing.
“We were all a little bit confused about what was going on. Of course, we want to back James and Ify on their timeline,” Jordan said. “But, we also are concerned about ensuring that we're able to support the students on campus with our elected positions as well.”
Mathew and White-Thorpe held a meeting with the UC’s executive board on Sunday. The UC executive board consists of the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and all committee chairs. UC Finance Committee chair Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22, who attended the executive council meeting, said attendees discussed plans for a general, council-wide meeting, as well as the UC’s overall goals for the semester.
Ganesh said she is looking forward to this semester on the UC, but added that she would like to see more open communication from Mathew and White-Thorpe to the council in the future.
“It would be helpful, I think, if we were informed of things a little bit beforehand sometimes,” Ganesh said. “But, I think there's always a learning curve, and I'm sure that they'll be wonderful once they settle into their roles.”
Mathew and White-Thorpe did not respond to requests for comment.
Some representatives said they want to improve the council’s communication with students and its “legitimacy” in the eyes of the student body.
“We should focus on trying to make sure we’re really connecting with people and having some kind of sense of legitimacy among the students,” UC representative Jack M. Swanson ’22 said.
Jordan said she believes students often do not notice some of the UC’s projects.
“I think that a lot of the student body doesn't completely know — and it's not their fault — all the functions and benefits that the UC provides weekly for, and the services that the UC provides for the students,” Jordan said.
Brennan agreed and said he wants the council to be more responsive to student concerns.
“I think that everybody on the UC tries their hardest to make sure that people are well represented, and that we are hearing the voices of the people, and we're trying to respond to that as best as possible,” Brennan said.
During their campaign, Mathew and White-Thorpe proposed creating a new “Unity Caucus” that would allow students from outside the UC to collaborate with representatives on projects.
UC treasurer Noah Harris ’22, co-chair of the council’s Black Caucus this semester, said he is excited about the possibility of working with other members of the student body.
“We’re going to see if we can bring in different voices than the ones that are normally heard, and then, use those to give students a voice,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Charles M. Lieber, an acclaimed nanoscientist and chair of Harvard’s Chemistry department, appeared in handcuffs in federal court, charged with concealing funding from the Chinese government and lying to American agencies about his alleged ties to China’s Thousand Talents Plan.
Lieber’s arrest, however, marked merely the latest development in an ongoing crackdown by the United States government and American universities on “academic espionage,” the process by which scientists pass academic research at American universities to foreign governments.
Experts say the recent federal crackdown on academic espionage — particularly connected to the Chinese government — could have negative effects on collaboration between universities.
The Chinese government established the Thousand Talents Plan in 2008, hoping to attract scholars from across the world to contribute to Chinese development. The U.S. government has since said the program poses a danger to national security.
The FBI and National Institutes of Health have contacted colleges and universities nationwide warning of espionage and intellectual property theft, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs announced at a November meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Harvard formed two new oversight committees this fall in response to those inquiries.
Earlier in January, Customs and Border Patrol agents stopped Zaoseng Zheng, a researcher affiliated with Harvard Medical School, as he attempted to smuggle biological research from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to China. Zheng was charged in connection to academic espionage alongside Lieber last week.
History professor William C. Kirby — who conducts research on contemporary China — wrote in an email that instances of espionage against the U.S. in decades past may have informed the current federal investigations. Kirby also wrote that a deterioration in U.S.-China relations over the past three years may have prompted the increase in investigations.
Stephanie Segal, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said she hopes the recent federal push will not have the effect of “dividing” the global research community.
“The outcome of this will hopefully not be erecting barriers to scientific collaboration,” Segal said. “Rather, that the integrity of those collaborations and kind of respect for the findings of the research collaboration are ones that the entire global community can benefit from.”
Segal added that China should not be held to a different standard than other countries, but regulators should ensure that research can benefit everyone.
“Foreign research collaboration can benefit the United States,” Segal said. “When there are foreign research collaborations with China, the priority needs to be on making sure that the benefits and the results of that research are ones that are shared broadly across the scientific community.”
Claude E. Barfield, a former consultant to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, used the recent coronavirus epidemic — which originated in China — as an example of a pressing issue that demands the two countries maintain research ties.
“The Chinese scientists are right there on the scene, and the U.S. scientists, we are picking up from the cases here,” Barfield said. “There's some areas that you certainly don't want to cut off scientific collaboration.”
Ross E. McKinney, Jr., the Chief Scientific Officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, wrote in an emailed statement that U.S. and Chinese researchers have shared a “fruitful and constructive collaboration that has advanced science and discovery.”
McKinney warned that the recent enforcement could spark suspicions about Chinese researchers in American labs.
“The fact that the Chinese government recruited faculty then told them to lie to their US employers and the federal government is problematic because it could raise suspicions about anyone with a collaboration with China, whether warranted or not,” McKinney wrote. “This is not about targeting individuals who are ethnically Chinese — it’s about the systematic actions of a foreign government.”
Several experts said China’s efforts to recruit scholars in other countries are not unusual. Kirby wrote in an email that the efforts are “quite natural.”
“China is investing more than any country in higher education, and as it expands its universities, it seeks talent from all sources,” he wrote. “It is, to be sure, a major effort, but we need to remember that every major research university seeks to recruit the best talent available, and if that talent is elsewhere, to bring them here. Certainly Harvard does that.”
Multiple Thousands Talents members said they did not interact directly with the national Chinese government during their time as members.
Tim Byrnes, an assistant professor of physics at NYU Shanghai and a member of the Thousand Talents program, said the program bears similarities to talent-attracting programs offered in other countries.
“I’m from Australia, which has its sort of equivalent kind of startup grant funded by the government,” Byrnes said. “Unfortunately, it got these connotations of somehow being connected to espionage. From what I can see, it’s really no different to any other types of talent-attracting grant.”
Byrnes said he has never been required to submit information to the Chinese government since he was awarded his grant four years ago.
W. Martin de Jong, a business professor at Erasmus University and former Thousand Talents participant, said he was appointed by the Shanghai government, rather than the national Chinese government, to serve as a part-time professor at Fudan University.
Segal and Barfield both said that, ultimately, they believe universities have the onus to police their own researchers’ connections to China.
“A lot of this is going to get back to the universities, to Harvard in this case — it should know what its scientists are doing and what impact that has, if any, on Harvard's own goals and Harvard's own standards,” Barfield said.
In the wake of Lieber’s arrest, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain announced Harvard was launching an internal investigation into Lieber’s case, though he declined to specify the scope of the probe.
Segal said that because universities have “pushed back” against heavy-handed enforcement measures taken by the federal government, such as restricting work with specific individuals, academic institutions will bear the responsibility for enforcement.
“There’s a lot more attention being paid as to whether or not the universities are making sure that laboratories and researchers in those laboratories are complying with disclosure policies,” Segal said. “And so inevitably, I think, unless the universities want the government to be taking a much more heavy-handed approach, it's going to fall to the universities to demonstrate compliance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The results of the highly anticipated Iowa Democratic caucuses were not released on Monday night due to “inconsistencies” found by the Iowa Democratic Party in caucus data.
The results are expected to be released Tuesday, according to CNN.
Iowa, the first state to weigh in on presidential primaries, does not account for a significant share of the delegates at the Democratic National Convention, where the party nominee is officially selected. However, the Iowa caucuses are important for candidates to gain momentum going into later primaries, according to Harvard Government Professor Ryan D. Enos.
“The literal significance in terms of the delegates is pretty minor because it’s a small state and there’s not many delegates awarded,” Enos said. “There’s an idea that [a win] can build momentum for a candidate and can make a candidate either look a lot more viable by exceeding expectations or look not as viable if they don’t hold up to the expectations that people have for them.”
Enos noted that the results of the Iowa caucuses and the next Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary can influence the results of states with bigger delegate counts, such as California.
“There’s people in California still that probably haven’t made up their minds and when they look at these results in New Hampshire and Iowa, those are things that affect the way they’re ultimately going to vote,” he said. “So people in California can still be swayed by what happens in the early states.”
Recent polling showed United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04, and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) running in a close four-way race in Iowa. U.S. Senator Amy J. Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also picked up traction among Iowans in recent weeks, according to an Emerson College poll.
Iowa is one of only six states that uses caucuses — as opposed to voting in traditional primaries — to determine how its delegates at the national party conventions will vote. In caucuses, which are run by state parties, voters congregate in groups and lobby undecided attendees to to support their prefered candidates at precincts around the state.
A number of Harvard affiliates participated in this year’s caucus process.
Nina B. Elkadi ’22, a lifelong Iowa City resident, is taking a leave of absence from Harvard this spring in order to participate in the Democratic primary process. In addition to working as a full-time organizing intern for the Elizabeth Warren campaign, Elkadi was selected as a precinct captain for an Iowa City precinct.
As precinct captain, Elkadi — a member of the Harvard College Democrats and Harvard for Warren — was responsible for speaking on behalf of the Warren campaign at her precinct and convincing caucus goers to support her candidacy.
“I need to be here. I need to be completely here, not even a little bit thinking about Harvard, or classes, or anything like that,” Elkadi said. “Being on Harvard's campus, I can do almost nothing as close to what I can do at home on the field, talking to people I grew up with.”
For the first time in its history, the Iowa Democratic Party also held satellite caucus events around the country where Iowans outside the state could still vote. At a remote event at the Democracy Center in Harvard Square Monday, Sanders topped other primary candidates with 22 votes from out-of-state Iowans. He was awarded two delegates.
Warren finished in second place at the Cambridge event with 20 voters and two delegates, Buttigieg finished third with eight votes and one delegate, and Andrew Yang had one voter and received no delegates.
Lottie Gidaul — a Wesleyan University freshman who hails from Iowa City — traveled to Cambridge to participate in the remote caucus. Gidal said she was persuaded to support Warren by other caucus goers.
“I make up a lot of my decisions by hearing other people’s perspectives and hearing what they’re excited about,” Gidal said. “My family is very much excited about Warren and a lot of my friends are excited about Warren. Understanding the passion that they have — just getting to feel that — I think that won me over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — With under three minutes left in the first semifinal of the 2020 Beanpot, No. 10/10 Harvard had managed to keep the deficit at 2-1 against No. 3/2 Northeastern. The Crimson defense and its junior goaltender Becky Dutton had faced many close calls from the Huskies attack—notably a puck off the post in the third and a series of key saves from Dutton—but seemed to maintain a “bend don’t break” attitude.
After keeping the game within one, Harvard received a critical opportunity to score when Northeastern defender Lauren MacInnis headed to the penalty box for checking with 2:48 left to play. However, the power play whittled away without the puck finding the net. As the Huskies completed the penalty kill, the Crimson tried its luck at a six-on-five by pulling Dutton for the extra skater. Just as Harvard (11-9-1, 10-4-1 ECAC) had stood up to the Northeastern (24-3-1, 20-2-0 HEAW) pressure, so too did the Huskies against the Crimson’s final rally. Soon after Dutton exited the goal, Northeastern junior forward Tessa Ward jumped out to a breakaway, sealing the Huskies’ victory with a quick empty-netter in the final 12 seconds of play.
“I actually think that power play at the end of the game hurt us. Based on where we are with our line up right now and how we’ve tweaked some things around to fill some holes, we might’ve been in a better position to go five, just with regular lines and add another attacker, keep[ing] our defensemen the way they were on the blue line,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We gave up a lot of space on the blue line as a result.”
Despite the frenetic finish, the game did not necessarily open with the same drama. For the better part of the first period, long stretches of continuous play produced few high-profile scoring chances. For the Crimson, the absence of sophomore forward Dominique Petrie, the team leader in points this season, undoubtedly complicated its offensive game plan. Momentum shifted drastically, however, when Northeastern capitalized off of a key Harvard mistake. With control of the puck in its own zone, the Crimson attempted a clearing pass that was intercepted by Huskies sophomore forward Alina Mueller. Building speed after the interception, Mueller managed to convert the turnover into a rush and top-corner finish to put Northeastern up 1-0.
“It was definitely a really even game, and both teams were just waiting for each other to make a mistake and to capitalize on that, so I’ve got to give credit to Northeastern for seeing that play develop and putting the puck away,” said co-captain and forward Kat Hughes. “But I think our team is incredibly resilient, and we didn’t let that get us down even though it was near the end of the period.”
Harvard would have to show that resilience not long into the second period when the Huskies widened their lead to 2-0. Northeastern junior defender Skylar Fontaine swiped a shot from the high slot, and the puck found its way through traffic before settling in the back of the net. Soon after the goal, the Crimson headed to the box on a checking minor from first-year forward Courtney Hyland. With the Huskies having just taken charge of the game’s momentum, the subsequent penalty would prove critical. A Northeastern goal could put the game out of reach for Harvard, but a successful kill could turn the tide back in the Crimson’s favor. Ultimately, the latter would prove true.
“If you can kill penalties, it’s always a huge momentum swing,” said co-captain and defender Ali Peper. “I think we played very tough on our penalty kill and loved to take advantage of when we had some open pucks to try to get the puck out and keep everything moving. It’s a huge confidence boost, especially after that second [Northeastern] goal went in.”
Shortly after completing the kill, Harvard first-year forward Shannon Hollands would make the Huskies pay for not cashing in on the power play. Breaking out of the defensive zone, sophomore forward Anne Bloomer knocked the puck laterally to fellow sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere, who would stretch the ice with a long-range breakout feed to Hollands. Receiving the pass, Hollands made no mistake, opting not to dish to the trailing Bloomer but instead to rifle the puck over the outstretched arm of Northeastern goaltender Aerin Frankel and under the bar.
Despite establishing an offensive presence, the Crimson would again have to spend stressful stretches in its own defensive zone due to an interference penalty by sophomore defender Maryna Macdonald. The Huskies would fire a flurry of point shots on net on the five-on-four chance, but Harvard came up with a series of key blocks from its defenders en route to a penalty kill.
“I think we could’ve capitalized on a few more chances,” Northeastern coach Dave Flint said. “Credit to their [Harvard’s] goalie—I thought she played great.”
As the game entered the final stanza, at times, the Crimson had to play constant defense. Northeastern sustained lengthy possessions and funneled pucks around the net, but nonetheless, Dutton successfully thwarted the Huskies’ attempts 15 times in the third period. With 7:27 remaining in the contest, Dutton managed to fend off a one-time blast, securing the rebound off her mask and into her glove. A few minutes later, she sprawled back to the post on a seemingly open wrap-around opportunity, paddling away the stuff attempt. The rebound deflected straight into the air before being swatted into the corner by the Crimson defense.
“Our defensemen did a good job trying to clear bodies out, and there was a lot of traffic, but I think they did a great job trying to move everyone so I could see the puck as much as possible,” Dutton said.
Both goaltenders stood tall, keeping the game scoreless for long stretches. 31:51 of game time would elapse between Hollands’ second-period strike and Northeastern’s empty-netter. Frankel improved on her already stellar 0.959 save percentage—which leads the nation—and her 1.06 goals against average, which counts for second-best in the NCAA Division I. Dutton, in only her third start and fourth appearance of the year, stood out as perhaps the Crimson’s impact player in the game. Despite the irregular playing time, she has surrendered only four goals on the 97 shots she has seen come her way in the 2019-2020 campaign.
“She is probably the toughest kid we have on our team, and I don’t mean to insult the others on our team because we’ve got a lot of tough kids,” Stone said. “She wills herself to make saves. She wills herself to put us in a position to be successful and keep us in a game. She has battled all kinds of different ailments or injuries here and there throughout her career. Her compete level is just over the top.”
Harvard will appear in the Beanpot’s consolation game next Tuesday, Feb. 11. The Crimson will also continue to vie for a playoff spot in the ECAC, taking on Cornell this Friday at 7 p.m.
“As coach always says, I think we were tough to play against today,” Peper reflected. “It’s nice to have that game to see what we can continue doing against top teams and know that we are a top team and move forward from there.”

You’ve made it through shopping week — you lotteried, you registered. Now, it’s time for the most perilous part of the new semester: sectioning. Sure, you’ve gotten a read on your professor and the energy of lecture. But you can’t shop a section. Enter the “vibe check,” or the process of altering the vibes of a space through verbal or nonverbal signaling. Here’s how to vibe check your section.
Set the Right Precedent with Your TF
They’re probably a nice person. They have a life outside of section. And they also hold your grades in their hands. Give them a smile, listen to their backstory. If you can vibe with your TF, you’ll probably vibe with their section, and being nice is the best way to guarantee their support in your pursuit of good vibes. If they’re giving off bad vibes, consider switching sections.
Chill Out
This isn’t a job interview. Vibing is a mindful, peaceful experience, so leave the stress at the door. If you’re in a room with windows, sit somewhere with a view. If there are no windows, consider bringing your SAD lamp. Nothing says vibing like great lighting AND curing your seasonal affective disorder.
Bring the Necessities
Pen? Check. Paper? Check. Tea? Check. EcoSystems cup stuffed with cereal? Check. Section is like grabbing a meal, except you don’t have to talk about how busy and stressed you are. Set the precedent early. If you’re in a building with a café in it (Barker Center), take a little break and go get yourself a snack. Take your time. Vibing can’t be rushed.
Section Kid
This is where the real vibe check comes in. When they start to speak, first, remember they are your peer, they are worthy of respect, and you might be able to learn something from them. Then commence the vibe check. It could be verbal, by saying something like “while I respect your thoughts, I would appreciate some space for the words of others.” You could also just stare a foot over their head the entire time they’re talking. Vibe checked!
Check the Whole Class
When the room’s energy is off, and you simply can’t vibe, take direct action. If all else fails, wait for a lull, then stand up and loudly say “vibe check.” If everybody looks at you like you’re crazy, they’ve failed the vibe check. Consider sending them this article.
It’s a new semester, it’s a new year. Ensure in 2020 that you’re surrounded with the best energy possible by vibe checking your way through your classes. And hey, if all else fails, at least you’ll still be vibing.

Elizabeth Banks rolled down Massachusetts Ave. on Friday afternoon in a Rolls Royce during the Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year parade, which was followed by a roast and press conference inside Farkas Hall. The actress, director, and producer was recognized with the Hasty Pudding’s annual honor, celebrated with a parade from Bow Street to Farkas Hall. With the acceptance of this honor, Elizabeth Banks joins the likes of Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Sandra Bullock.


Members of The Hasty Pudding Theatricals processed down Massachusetts Ave. ahead of the Woman of the Year. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals will put on their 172nd production, "HPT 172: Mean Ghouls," beginning on Friday, February 8th.


Elizabeth Banks arrived Friday afternoon, stepping out of a black tinted car at the beginning of the parade route near the Inn at Harvard, and stepped into her car along with members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.

 
After kissing her on the cheek, Scott Kall '20, Cast Vice President of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, wiped lipstick off Elizabeth Banks’ face.


As members of Hasty Pudding Theatricals walked and danced alongside the Woman of the Year, they posed for an iPhone photo with spectators of the parade. Many people in the crowd were taking photos of Elizabeth Banks and posing with members of the Theatricals.

 
Elizabeth Banks, who directed, produced, and starred in the 2019 edition of "Charlie’s Angels," posed with Elias W. Russell '20 and Scott Kall '20 during the parade.

 

 
After Elizabeth Banks exits the Rolls Royce upon reaching Farkas Hall, she joins members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals in a short but fun dance on the steps of Farkas Hall. The parade ended at Farkas Hall where Banks was ushered inside for a roast, press conference, and preview of the Pudding's 172nd production.




In the quest to obtain her Pudding Pot, the Theatricals provide joke-filled challenges relevant to Banks's career. With reference to the 2001 film "Wet Hot American Summer," where Paul Rudd tells Banks she tastes like a burger mid-makeout, Banks proceeds to eat a bite of a burger and kiss a cutout of Rudd’s face.


After a roast, Elizabeth Banks receives an engraved Pudding Pot on the stage of Farkas Hall. After receiving her Pudding Pot, she headed upstairs to a press conference where she answered questions ranging from Oscars predictions to her thoughts about the preceding events of the day.
