After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Writing about the Hispanic identity is very difficult. That might be because it doesn’t exist. Maybe it’s just my Social Studies-esque “everything is discourse” sensibility talking, but regardless, I can’t help but notice that in the same way Foucault wrote “Before the end of the eighteenth century, man did not exist,” at Harvard, Hispanics don’t exist either.
I’m not trying to make some vague postmodernist argument about the social construction of race. Maybe there really is some ideal “Hispanic” floating around somewhere in Platonic heaven. But here on Earth, what really matters to Hispanics at Harvard, myself included, is what people actually see as the Hispanic identity, and how it impacts our interactions on campus. It is in this sense that the Hispanic identity is a problem — so fractured, diverse, and ill-defined that for all intents and purposes, it doesn’t exist.
The most obvious place where the Hispanic problem rears its head is in the mundane work of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census questionnaire asks respondents to identify their race, presenting options for White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. “Hispanic” doesn’t make the list because the nature of Hispanicism encompasses various races. There are White Hispanics, Black Hispanics, and Asian Hispanics. Instead, the questionnaire asks in a separate question if the respondent identifies as Hispanic.
This solution addresses the narrow problem faced by the Census Bureau — identifying Hispanics — but, in a broader sense, it exemplifies a failure to fully understand how Hispanics actually identify themselves. Many Cubans, for example, do not consider themselves Hispanic but rather Cuban-American, an identity meant to recognize a particular culture, history, and set of traditions distinct from that of other Hispanics in the U.S. Differences in racial self-identification further distinguish Cubans: In 2004, 86 percent of Cubans identified themselves as white on the Census, while only 50 percent of Puerto Ricans did the same.
In general, Hispanics tend to identify much more with their country of origin than with the term Hispanic. According to Pew Research, only 24 percent of Hispanics use the terms Hispanic or Latino most often to describe their identity. Over half prefer instead to use their family’s country of origin to identify themselves.
Go to any Hispanic event at Harvard and you’ll see this diversity of identities. There are international students who identify more with their home countries than they do with the Hispanic population on campus. There are second-generation immigrants who grew up speaking the Spanish of their parent’s home culture. There are other second-generation immigrants who found a place within a local American-Hispanic culture, and still others who are Black and Hispanic and must balance those two identities. Misguided attempts to generalize Hispanics into one ethno-racial group is what leads people to be surprised when they see the 32 percent of Hispanics who voted Republican in 2020.
Some may see this fracturing of the Hispanic identity as a problem in light of issues with Hispanic representation on campus. In final clubs, for instance, the general consensus is that Hispanics are among the least represented groups. Some people hear mention of the “Black Fly” or a pipeline between Black Men’s Forum and final clubs and conclude that the answer to this lack of representation is to strengthen the institutional and social power of Hispanic affinity organizations, creating a strong, unified Hispanic identity on campus.
Well-intentioned as they may be, calls to create a shared Hispanic identity at Harvard are misguided. Hegel believed that the definition of an identity requires opposition with an Other. Many times this definition is needed, but in this case, in creating a defined Hispanic identity, we risk distancing ourselves from the rest of the student body — all in pursuit of reifying a community that doesn’t need to exist. Instead of trying to construct a community to match the term Hispanic, we should embrace the differences between Hispanic identities and try to learn from one another.
This is not to say that I don’t support the Hispanic affinity organizations on campus. People should embrace all those communities with which they identify; affinity organizations help them do just that. All I’m saying is that we should not lament the fact that Hispanics lack the social cohesion that other identities may have on campus. Instead, we should celebrate the differences between the Hispanic identities that make us who we are.
For someone writing a piece about identity, I haven’t talked a lot about my own so far. Yes, I am Hispanic, but knowing that doesn’t tell you anything about me. Instead of knowing me as a Hispanic student, you should know me as the son of two Colombian immigrants, someone who only speaks Spanish at home, who grew up in Atlanta and visits their family in Colombia often. I am Hispanic, but before that, I am an individual, who, like many, has a story that cannot be generalized into one overarching identity. As Hispanic Heritage Month begins, I urge you to listen to the stories — in the Crimson’s pages and beyond — that define each of us. Reading them, you’ll see the differences that, paradoxically, are what make us all Hispanic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mom reads my column.
Honestly, I was very surprised when she told me off-handedly this summer that she had read it. Frankly, I didn’t think anyone in my family particularly cared. I don’t mean that in a bad way; I merely found the revelation surprising because, for all that I talk about neurodiversity, the topic doesn’t come up often in conversations with family members. I actually don’t even know whether my extended family knows I have ADHD, or if they do, what that actually means or looks like for me.
Occasionally though, my mom will tell me stories about how looking back, she now sees the signs of neurodiversity in family and friends around her growing up in Sri Lanka. Often, especially if they displayed visible signs, they were made fun of for being lazy and impulsive, erratic oddballs at best. At worst, they were completely ostracized from family and community. Maybe with the right support, things could have been different. But, then and there, there weren’t accommodations, let alone empathy — it was simply sink or swim. Now, reflecting back, that survivalist attitude to “continue swimming,” even through the whirlpools and riptides, is one that crosses cultures and countries, and intricately intertwines with immigration narratives and generational gaps.
For those who hold other marginalized identities in addition to being neurodivergent, to be neurodivergent isn’t merely “being neurodivergent.” It’s simultaneously to be all that you are, neurodivergent, a person of color, queer, and every other multitude you contain. It’s an intersectional experience. Though the intersection of culture and mental health/neurodiversity is underexplored, they’re heavily intertwined, considering that the experiences from generations before significantly affect us. Take Anna Roodnitsky, Dartmouth ’25, who describes to me her father’s experiences in Ukraine and how they interacted with her mental health journey.
“I had to go through a lot with my family emotionally because my dad has a history of extreme emotional turmoil.” She continues. “He grew up a poor Ukrainian farm boy with a history of an alcoholic father, and they had been robbed before. He has plenty of emotional trauma. He was just taught in Soviet society to suck it up, but it manifests in his day-to-day actions. Because if you don't talk about it, it still affects your life.”
While cultural intergenerational trauma is heavily pertinent to the exploration of neurodiversity and culture, I want to make it abundantly clear that I wholeheartedly refuse to perpetuate any misconceptions that life and culture are much better in the U.S. than elsewhere.
Born in the United States, I’ve seen how the American Dream is peddled, both here and across the world. My parents left a country in the midst of war in the 1990s and had to come to terms with the fact that the place they were leaving behind wasn’t the place they knew growing up. Yet, especially when I’m back in Sri Lanka, I wonder about how the large, yet tight-knit communities of family and friends, rich culture with breathtaking religious festivals and mouth-watering food could have all been mine to grow up with. To exist in a space where your eyes aren’t the darkest eyes anyone’s ever seen, where you’re not the token brown person.
All this to say, here in the U.S. we love to think that “the U.S. is so amazing,” and in turn, “everything’s so much worse in other countries,” Jailene Ramos ’24 tells me as we unpack the nuances of our neurodiverse oldest daughter of immigrants tales. Tracing back to “colonization and whiteness,” narratives of American supremacy are “spoon-fed to immigrants in this country” who often internalize them and pass them down. It results in their children, and even their children’s children believing that there’s always worse than what they face and using that belief to invalidate their own struggles.
“How dare I struggle, or feel any form of whatever, when people in my country are doing so much worse?” She continues, explaining how her parents would tell her that “people in our country are just so much worse because they have to deal with corrupt governments and poverty.” That may be true, “but it also sucks here.”
“At least back home, you have your culture. At least you have your people, you're surrounded by others who support each other,” Ramos says. “In this country, you don't. In this country, you are fighting against everyone.”
I’m sure many first-generation Americans like myself can relate to the notion of constantly navigating spaces that are not for us, the unfortunate reality of the American ExperienceTM as a BIPOC. You may wonder how maybe elsewhere, there exists a space that could have been for us. This sentiment parallels my journey with neurodivergence, except that “space,” that “ancestral land” that would have been more accepting, doesn’t seem to exist. Being neurodivergent transcends cultural background, and yet, worldwide, it’s heavily stigmatized and silenced. And, especially if you live in a country that differs from your country of heritage, those cultural factors may inform or shape your relationship to neurodiversity.
Though Ramos isn’t the first or only neurodivergent person in her family, she tells me, “my family and my culture don’t believe in mental health,” which she attributes to a variety of factors including lack of privilege, space, and resources, as well as strong religious notions rooted in her culture.
So, as the first to be willing to discuss our experiences with neurodiversity openly, we’re the ones who have taken on the sacrifices of progress, even though it isn’t fair that it’s our burden to bear. And yet, it often feels like, if everyone before me has made sacrifices so I could be here, writing this behind Harvard’s Ivy League name, how could I not do everything I possibly can to make things easier for everyone who follows, so they don’t have to feel alone in the ways that I did?
Yet, it’s no one person’s fault I feel all this pressure. It’s not my parents’ fault that the survivalist attitude helped them find success. They didn’t have the grace to make mistakes or fail and only wanted to see me succeed as well.
These pressures have deep systemic roots, and long branches that run so deep, it can be hard to even think of questioning them, let alone unlearning them. As “the oldest child of immigrants, and especially if you're a girl, it's like the quadruple whammy” of neurodiversity, culture, gender, and oldest child pressures. Ramos, who has Major Depressive Disorder, describes how these factors made it seem like the journey to get to a better point took “longer than it should have.”
“I had all of those pressures of ‘everything has to be perfect.’ I have to be on top of things. All of the entire burden of beginning to build generational wealth for my people, falls on my shoulders. Especially now that I have the privilege of going to Harvard and getting an education, just the fact that I graduated high school, which is something that my parents didn't do, and now that I get to go to college for free,” fed into Ramos’s denial surrounding having depression.
It’ll take many years, much representation, and many conversations to find accessibility and acceptance in all of the cultures we belong to with all of our identities. And true to my eldest daughter of immigrants nature, it’s an area I try to pave the way in, even if, admittedly, there’s a price to pay. But, as I get older, and let go of the lessons that no longer serve me (even if they served generations upon generations before me), I find myself no longer swimming to survive.
Hi, Mom. If you’re reading this, does it scare you that I’m writing this column? It’s honestly too late now since it’s now the start of the second semester of my writing it, and it’s basically public information that I have ADHD. Even if I may have been able to hide it, it’s a path that’s now foreclosed, no matter how much ableism and judgment I face. But, if we both know one thing, it’s that “I never listen anyways” (that doubles as an ADHD joke), so I’m sure I’ll be okay. Thank you for always doing your best for me; with every day I grow more grateful for the sacrifices you made and lessons you’ve learned the hard way, all so I can tell you in The Crimson that I love you. Hopefully, with pieces like these, someday, if I ever have a daughter, she can write a column piece on her identity without scaring you and me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For as long as humans have had a conception of time, there have been people who wanted time to stop.
Sometimes it’s a happy wish: the desire to freeze a moment forever, no matter what happens in the future. It’s the question of “Why can’t I stay here forever?” and the thought of “I wish each day could be like this.” It’s the fundamental idea behind why many of us have thousands of photos saved on our phones, why we smile at a camera even when we aren’t happy. We want certain memories to endure, unmoving, even as the world and our lives change.
Other times our wish to stop time is born out of fear of its passage. The quest for immortality is a theme that has inspired stories from “The Epic of Gilgamesh,” the world’s oldest surviving literature, to “Harry Potter.” Poets, alchemists, philosophers, theologians, and scientists alike have debated what it means to be immortal and how someone might achieve it — how someone might live eternally, stay constant despite the years flowing by — or, in other words, how they might freeze time for themselves. Societies construct monuments to ensure that the legacy of the departed remains present to the living, people of all ages long for their earlier years, and today we even have in cosmetics an entire industry centered largely on making the passage of time less visible.
Our desire for time to stop and our reluctance at its passing is so deeply embedded into our human nature that it drives many of our most basic interactions.
“It’s been a while,” we say. “I missed you.”
We’re obsessed with it.
Wishes can take many shapes, and wanting time to stop isn’t inherently wrong. It’s not always unjustified to want a moment to last forever. But in cases like mine, I think it’s a problem.
This summer, I realized I’m on fire, burning from the past. I experienced my first emotionally intimate friendship, which led me to confront parts of myself I’d never known existed. I was diagnosed with major depression, compounding my experiences of living disabled, which I’ve previously written a column about. And I realized that I’m neither cisgender nor heterosexual, forcing me to recontextualize my life experiences and rethink who I am. Not to mention that I’m at a point of transition in my life: I’m on a leave of absence before my senior year, and I don’t feel ready.
I want time to stop. I want time to stop so I can avoid the future. I don’t want to move forward and face my problems. I want everything to remain as it is.
The present, this instantaneous moment, is all that really exists, all we have besides our memory and our imagination; tomorrow is endlessly a day away, and as we pursue it, second after second disappears into the past. Dwelling in that past may make us depressed, and anticipating the future triggers anxiety. So we tend to live in the present, but even here, we need to resist the urge to stagnate, to deny change, to create an endless now.
I don’t think I’ve succeeded in avoiding that trap. It feels like I’m stuck in a photo I never wanted to take, one I’m not smiling in, long after the camera is gone.
I can’t smile. I physically can’t smile or frown, because my facial muscles are too weak to move. So to be honest, I hate looking at myself. How do I convey that I’m human, that my face is just a natural mask? I don’t know. It makes me feel powerless, like I don’t fit anywhere, and — okay, yeah, I get existential easily — I sometimes wonder what purpose I can live for if I can’t even show who I am.
But people tell me I can smile, whenever I complain about it. They say the miniscule smirk I unconsciously put on is my smile. And I get annoyed, because it feels patronizing; it’s nothing like the glowing faces everyone else displays in photos. But maybe they’re right, that this is my smile.
Smiles are how we in the moment present ourselves towards the future. They’re how we move on.
We live in a world that often doesn’t give us choices, or only lets certain people choose. I didn’t choose to be disabled, to be mentally ill, to be queer, to want time to stop. But that’s how I am, and I’d like to be proud of that. So at this moment, I want to understand how to move on from uncertainty, regret, and pain, within the limits of this world; how we define and accept ourselves through the smiles we choose. Only by examining ourselves and our fears can we restart the flow of time for ourselves and transfer the losses we experience into a purpose for living and an acceptance of change.
This column will be my own smile, exploring my personal challenges, including with my disabilities, mental health, and queerness, but also with the universal struggles of being human, as I work towards an answer. It’s not a smile you’ll notice often — it barely looks like anything. But all the more for it, this column is my attempt to illuminate unseen experiences and lives, at Harvard and beyond, and to contribute to all of us finding a way forward together.
It’s a smile that says, “I don’t know why I’m here or where I’m going, and I don’t want to walk any farther; but others have felt this way before me, and I’ll find my own way too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One-third of Pakistan is underwater. It’s a figure that’s difficult to grasp, but one you’ve likely seen regularly in recent days: Our peers in the Harvard College Pakistani Students Association, or HCPSA, tirelessly organized to raise awareness and money for those affected, papering our campus with flyers and attempting to enlist the support of other organizations.
The intensity of their advocacy matches the severity of Pakistan’s plight. In recent weeks, an unusually strong monsoon season resulted in massive flooding across the country of over 225 million. The floods have damaged infrastructure and destroyed crops, displacing millions of people and claiming thousands of lives. Those numbers, and the associated suffering, will only rise day by day.
Since the beginning of the crisis, the HCPSA has advanced an ambitious flood relief fundraising campaign. Members have camped out in common areas from the Smith Campus Center to individual dining halls. They’ve sent emails and reportedly raised over $20,000. They’ve also asked faculty for support and expressed disappointment with the underwhelming College response. When HCPSA asked faculty deans to extend support on house mailing lists, that relatively modest step proved too much for many of them.
Of course, we as a student body need not look to our administrators for guidance on which causes to support. We have the agency to support our peers — as many already have support HCPSA — when they rally for a clearly worthy cause. And yet, our agency doesn’t relieve Harvard administrators of their duty to get this question right: How should the University respond to instances of international crisis?
We understand the objection that showing even symbolic support for any one cause necessitates the exclusion of others. While Harvard is an institution of global influence, it is surely free of the obligation to advocate for every worthy cause across the globe. Some might argue that an intermediate stance of amplifying some causes but not others is untenable, inevitably unfair to a myriad of conceivable struggles.
But we can, and indeed must, draw a line without disrespecting those it excludes. What differentiates the HCPSA’s efforts is not simply the worthiness of their cause but also the intensity of their efforts. When students rally in large numbers and at length for a worthy cause, administrators have strong reason to consider taking small steps to recognize that cause and the effort it engendered.
Doing so helps bring attention to causes that deserve our support; it models the values of our community. If Harvard wants to be known as an institution that drives global change, it should adopt attitudes toward student activism reflective of that goal.
Of course, we hope that the catastrophe in Pakistan arouses more than the modest symbolic support of our faculty deans and administrators. The carnage we see (or should see) in the news can serve as a reminder of the terrible cost of climate change and the horrific iniquity of who suffers the consequences. It should, in turn, encourage Harvard to redouble its extensive efforts to explore the effects of climate change and the nature of possible solutions. Developing nations will suffer the brunt of the impact of climate change. A global Harvard will recognize that inequity and strive to combat it.
These are lofty goals. In the meantime, all we ask for are a couple of emails.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University president is not the only top leadership position Harvard is seeking to fill this year.
With three months to go before its longtime executive director steps down, the Harvard Alumni Association is in the middle of a search for its new leader.
Philip W. Lovejoy, who has held the top permanent post at the HAA since 2014, announced in February he will step down in December after serving in a variety of roles across 24 years at Harvard.
The HAA connects over 400,000 living alumni to Harvard and its networks across the globe. Lovejoy’s successor will manage approximately 40 staff members who support alumni programming, including reunions and Harvard Club events.
Lovejoy steered the HAA through its transition to virtual operations during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the organization eased back into in-person programming, it opted to split its reunions and annual meeting from University Commencement festivities, angering some alumni who cherished the longtime tradition of the events being held on the same day.
Harvard has hired prominent executive search firm Isaacson, Miller to help find the next HAA executive director, according to an Aug. 8 email from Brian K. Lee, the vice president of Harvard Alumni Affairs and Development. Founded in 1982, the Boston-based firm specializes in leadership searches for higher education and nonprofits.
Bringing in the firm will help “ensure that the net is cast widely and not confined to just Harvard ‘insiders,’” higher education expert Thomas D. Parker ’64 wrote in an email.
“It’s an important job,” Parker wrote. “They need to take whatever time is necessary to find someone who is a good fit.”
The HAA has also solicited suggestions and nominations from alumni and named an advisory committee made up of current and former HAA leaders. Some alumni groups also received invitations to live focus groups.
E. Andrew Grinstead ’97, president of the Harvard Christian Alumni Society, said it will be “difficult” to find a candidate who will be comfortable navigating an alumni network as “diverse and geographically broad” as Harvard’s.
“You need someone who’s got the ability to listen,” Grinstead said. “You’ve got to have someone who is genuine in their desire to hear from all parts of the community.”
Though Lovejoy himself is not a graduate of Harvard, his father, George M. Lovejoy Jr. ’51, was an active alumnus until his death in 2020. Philip Lovejoy wrote in the email announcing his departure that he plans to spend more time working for the Blue Hills Foundation, a working land trust in New Hampshire that his father established in 1982.
Laura A. Parkin ’86, co-president of Harvard Alumni for Climate and the Environment, said that though a Harvard degree should not be a prerequisite for the job, the pick should have “some familiarity with how universities work.”
“These sorts of institutions seem to be unique beasts,” Parkin said.
As in the ongoing hunt for Harvard’s 30th president, diversity is important to some alumni.
“One of the things that we would love to see is for it to be a person of color or a person from a marginalized identity,” said Jacob A. Barrera, co-president of the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance.
Barrera said he would like to see a Latinx person “because there’s been so much negativity around Latino professors and faculty at Harvard” in recent years, citing Lorgia García Peña’s 2019 tenure denial, which sparked outcry and calls for tenure reform.
“For us, it is really hard to engage alumni when they see Harvard treat our other alumni or other Latino faculty and staff in such a way. For us, diversity, for sure, is at the top of our list,” Barrera said.
University spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
According to the Isaacson, Miller website, 46 percent of all of its executive placements have been women and 27 percent have been people of color.
Parkin said she hopes the next HAA leader will tackle urgent challenges such as climate change.
“It’s a tough line to walk because Harvard is an institution of tradition, and we love traditions,” she said. “But we also want to make sure that Harvard remains on the leading edge of innovation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In fall 2020, Harvard was mired in controversy after students in Government 50: “Data” discovered racist blog posts, which students alleged were authored by course instructor David D. Kane.
Kane’s contract with Harvard as a Government preceptor ended in June 2021. But this fall, he will be back in a classroom — teaching a section of Statistics 118: “Introductory Statistics” at Simmons University.
In September 2020, students accused Kane of using the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” to write racist posts on EphBlog, a website for Williams College affiliates founded by Kane, a 1988 graduate of the school, in 2003. “Field” had been writing posts since 2003, according to the site, and one post by “Field” in 2014 was signed “David Kane ’88.”
Some posts by “Field” claim that more than 90 percent of Black students at Williams would not have been admitted if not for their race, criticize Williams for condemning white supremacist group Identity Evropa, and call on Williams to stop partnering with QuestBridge — an organization that allows low-income students to apply to partner universities for free.
Jeffry A. Frieden, chair of the Government Department at the time, initially called teaching staff “unprofessional” for encouraging students to boycott Kane’s lecture. A few days later, he issued an apology for the “pain and hurt” caused by the posts. Government professor Kosuke Imai took over as the head instructor of Gov 50 while Kane continued teaching optional lectures.
Kane’s contract was not renewed after the 2020-2021 academic year.
In a statement Wednesday, Simmons Interim Provost Russell Pinizzotto wrote that Kane’s blog posts “did not surface” during the university’s hiring process, and students may transfer out of his class without penalty.
He added that the university is “committed” to creating an “open, respectful, and inclusive environment.”
“We do not support any statements or positions that contradict this commitment, because they run counter to who we are as an institution,” he wrote.
Pinizzotto said the school would “continue to monitor the situation” and provide any necessary updates.
“While we may sometimes vehemently disagree with an individual’s views, we support freedom of speech, in part because of the historic importance of this principle,” he added.
EphBlog was uncovered by Gov 50 student Alexis Queen ’23 after Kane invited controversial author Charles A. Murray ’95, prompting her to search her professor on Google. Queen said hearing that Kane would be teaching at Simmons was “disappointing,” in part because information about the controversy surrounding Kane is so easily accessible.
“When it first happened, my sophomore year, it was just like this feeling of ‘Oh, this is pretty readily accessible. Harvard could have seen this,’” Queen said. “I think now when you Google him, what comes up is The Crimson’s coverage of this whole situation, and so the fact that he once again got hired is just like, it’s kind of disappointing.”
Albert Yao ’24, who also took Kane’s class at Harvard, added that he was “not too surprised” to hear Kane would be teaching again.
“Academia in general doesn’t care that much about the personal behaviors of their teachers,” he said. “It just seems like regardless of what they say or what actions they have — even if they’re really, really negative — it seems that schools will still hire them to teach.”
Abigail J. Skalka, who took Kane’s class as a graduate student, said she hopes Simmons students will boycott the class and protest Kane’s employment.
“I don’t think that this is the kind of thing that we can leave up to university administrations, nor do I think we should,” she said.
Kane did not respond to a request for comment.

At Memorial Church’s first Faith and Life Forum of the semester on Sunday, Minister Matthew I. Potts commemorated the 21st anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The forum is a weekly discussion that seeks to integrate faith-based dialogue with questions about life. The event, held each Sunday at 9:30 a.m. in Harvard’s Memorial Church, is open to the public.
Sunday’s event took place as a roundtable discussion, with Potts posing questions to the audience and inviting discussion. The conversation focused on the idea of apocalypse, what it means biblically, and how it applies to the modern world.
Potts asked attendees what apocalypse means to them in the face of fractured politics and climate change concerns.
“A sense of things falling apart,” one attendee responded.
Potts went on to say that apocalypse is “a way to try to make meaning of suffering.”
One forum attendee asked Potts to reflect on 9/11, since the forum was held on the anniversary of the attacks.
Potts, who was working in the Notre Dame admissions office at the time, recalled the fear he and his colleagues felt as they observed the attack on television.
But, he said, “the first time I can remember thinking of apocalypse was not until two years later, when the US was considering — and then did — invade Iraq.”
Potts urged attendees to think about theodicy: “the justice of God,” as he defined it.
“The basic problem of theodicy is: if God is good, and if God is all powerful, then why does bad happen?”
“A particular question is not just why are we suffering, but why hasn’t God prevented this suffering?” Potts asked.
Potts also discussed climate change as a reality people find difficult to come to terms with. He said climate activists and scientists often face challenges in communicating a difficult truth to the public.
“One of the reasons I chose apocalypse and one of the reasons I think there is a religious response to climate change is because I think we can be told the truth about what the world faces,” Potts said.
In his closing remarks, Potts said attendees can take “some comfort” though “there is suffering now.”
“Take ease or take comfort because it will all work out again,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union filed a grievance against the University last month, claiming Harvard failed to ensure “a safe and healthy work and educational environment.”
The grievance denounced professor John L. Comaroff’s return to teaching this fall. Comaroff was placed on unpaid leave in January following a pair of University investigations, which found he had violated Harvard’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
The complaint, filed on Aug. 8 by the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, alleged that by allowing Comaroff to teach, the University violated provisions outlined in Articles 7 and 10 of the HGSU-UAW contract, which require Harvard to protect affiliates from discrimination and remedy any harm.
“Comaroff’s presence in the classroom is an unnecessary threat to safety of women and queer students, including student workers who may work in the same buildings in which he teaches,” the grievance states.
HGSU-UAW President Koby D. Ljunggren said the grievance has “played out like no other grievance has before.”
Ljunggren said the University requested a private meeting after receiving the complaint, where administrators said the school wanted to bypass the typical grievance process steps, in which the union would meet with University stakeholders.
Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations wrote in an August response to the grievance that the union’s contract does not give HGSU-UAW jurisdiction over how the University decides to discipline faculty and staff.
“As the union should be aware, the contract between the University and the union explicitly retains for the University the exclusive right to make academic decisions, including but not limited to who is taught, what is taught, how it is taught and who does the teaching,” the letter reads.
The letter added that Harvard believes the complaint does not fall under matters that can be resolved through the contract’s grievance process.
“The union sought to change the Title IX policies and procedures during bargaining but ultimately agreed … that the University has the exclusive right to amend the policies and that student workers may not raise complaints regarding sexual and gender-based harassment through grievance and arbitration,” Harvard's letter reads.
“If the union nevertheless seeks to challenge the question of grievability and arbitrability, it may proceed directly to arbitration,” it adds.
But some union members have voiced concerns about the feasibility of the arbitration process.
“An arbitration can take many months to settle,” said Denish K. Jaswal, co-chair of the Contract Enforcement and Education Committee. “So by the time we got in front of an arbitrator, the class would have already been over.”
Ljunggren said the union’s goal is to protect all affiliates on campus from harassment and discrimination.
“Looking forward — while the grievance might be sort of dead in the water — I think what we’re really trying to do is make sure the campus is continuing to engage in the conversation around Title IX reform,” they said.
As of Sept. 14, no students are enrolled in Comaroff’s course, down from two when the course began, according to FAS class enrollment data.
Max G. Ehrenfreund, a sixth-year graduate student and a member of HGSU-UAW, said the responsibility of protecting affiliates should lie in Harvard’s hands.
“As to what happens next, I think that’s a question that administrators really need to answer,” he said.
“If they don’t answer it, the University will continue to suffer reputational damage, and the potential that Comaroff will continue to abuse the students will remain unaddressed,” Ehrenfreund continued.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven addressed the victory of the right-wing bloc in his country’s parliamentary election, calling the Sweden Democrats an “extremist right-wing party, a racist party,” during the first Harvard Institute of Politics forum of the semester on Wednesday.
Löfven’s remarks came just hours after his successor as prime minister of Sweden and fellow member of the Social Democratic Party, Magdalena Andersson, announced she would resign on Thursday, following election results that saw the far-right Sweden Democrats win 20 percent of the vote. Until recently, the Sweden Democrats were rejected by mainstream political rivals because of the party’s neo-Nazi roots.
The Social Democratic Party, which had been in government since Löfven began his tenure as prime minister in 2014, will continue to be led by Andersson in opposition.
“I’m scared,” Löfven said in an interview after the forum. “It is a huge mistake by the conservatives and liberals and the Christian Democrats to try to cooperate with these extremists.”
“As John F. Kennedy once said, if you try to ride on the tiger’s back, you end up in his belly,” Löfven added. “I think history has proven that.”
During the forum, Löfven said that the far-right’s resurgence in Europe is reminding people of fascism’s rise on the continent nearly a century ago.
“We have survivors from the Holocaust saying that we can now hear the same rhetoric, the same arguments that we heard in the 1930s,” Löfven said. “That is a very serious situation.”
The forum, which was moderated by IOP Interim Director Setti D. Warren, discussed democracy and the upcoming 2022 midterm elections. The event featured Löfven alongside the IOP’s six other resident fellows: Raul Alvillar, Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, Stephanie Carlton, Judith LeBlanc, Matthew Mead, and Natalie Tennant.
Alvillar, who served as New Mexico state director for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign, said abortion will propel Democrats in November.
“I want to talk about Dobbs 24/7,” Alvillar said, referring to the Supreme Court decision earlier this year that overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating constitutional protections for abortion.
Alvillar said Republicans miscalculated by thinking the issue would “motivate and galvanize” their voter base.
“Instead, it has actually motivated the Democratic base — it has motivated men, it has motivated women, and most importantly, it has motivated young folks,” Alvillar added. “You can’t give somebody a right and then take it away.”
LeBlanc, the executive director of the Native Organizing Alliance, said in order to achieve change, it is important to remain politically engaged during the months between election cycles.
“These elections are very important, but the truth is that Election Day is only a snapshot of the balance of politics,” LeBlanc said. “Everything that happens between elections — on issues at the grassroots level — is what shapes the outcome of elections.”
LeBlanc said there are currently “a historic high number of Natives” running for both federal and local office.
“There is so much vibrancy at the tribal and grassroots level,” LeBlanc said. “People are engaged in issues and they understand that elections matter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge’s new city manager Yi-An Huang ’05 assumes leadership over city government and the City Council resumes regular meetings after the summer, councilors have set their sights once again on a contentious issue: multifamily housing.
On Tuesday, the Housing Committee of the Council held a meeting relaunching discussions on allowing multifamily residential developments throughout the entire city.
Tuesday’s discussion centered around eliminating single- and two-family zoning to allow for denser residential development. Currently, much of the area west of Harvard Square only allows for building single- and two-family buildings.
And on Wednesday night, five councilors — Marc C. McGovern, Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, Paul F. Toner, and Burhan Azeem — gathered for a virtual town hall meeting hosted by housing advocacy group A Better Cambridge to discuss the city’s housing crisis.
Mallon told The Crimson that the “long overdue” conversation on zoning reform “had a couple of fits and starts and I’m hoping that we can get it right back on the path and get the train out of the station.”
Cambridge City Councilors and policymakers have long recognized the severity of the housing crisis and the need to increase the city's housing supply. But finding and implementing policy solutions has been easier said than done, according to Azeem.
“Even if people agree that the current situation is bad, everyone can have different ideas of how to make the future better,” he said in an interview Wednesday.
Azeem also noted that detailed technical discussions around zoning can be lengthy, but said the council will “get to it this term.”
He said he looked forward to the Council “taking a lead” on eliminating restrictive zoning regulations.
Later this month, Huang and the councilors will go on a retreat to discuss the council’s working relationship with the city manager, as well as goals and priorities for the start of Huang’s term.
Toner said he hopes to identify three or four priorities to be “laser-focused on” and that issues related to housing “will definitely be at the top of the list.”
In November 2021, the Council called on the Community Development Department and the city’s Planning Board to “develop concepts and principles” to change the zoning code and allow for multifamily development.
Azeem said he thought the Planning Board was “not particularly excited” about certain aspects of the proposal but expressed optimism about the possibility of reaching consensus.
Toner said he felt there was potential to increase communication and alignment between the Council and other government bodies that deal with zoning and development, such as the Planning Board and the Board of Zoning Appeals.
“We have to have a better conversation with them about the goals of the city and City Council in terms of our housing initiatives,” Toner said.
Azeem also argued that Cambridge has had an “ugly history” of using zoning regulations to “[push] out people of color,” but that eliminating restrictive zoning laws could be a step forward.
“I think that this will be the city council that will end that history and allow for multifamily housing,” he said. “We’re going to do everything in our power.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s Rugby 15s team was back in action this past weekend, kicking off its 2022 campaign with a 48-19 win over Quinnipiac. Coming off a third place finish at the NIRA National Championships last fall, the Crimson rolled in its first game back at Mignone Field, setting the tone for what promises to be an exciting season ahead.
“I think we had a good start to the season,” said sophomore fullback/wing Chloe Headland after the game. “Everything went well. We executed what we wanted to execute. Obviously, the win is a big outcome.”
Harvard started the day off strong, using solid team defense and relentless pressure on offense to shoot out to a 31-0 lead behind tries from a trio of first-years – Lennox Landon, Cameron Fields and Tiana Padhilla. However, despite the lopsided score, the game was far from over. The Bobcats, fresh off a 47-14 drubbing of Brown on Sept. 3, readjusted at the half, and behind improved all-around defense and renewed vigor on offense, were able to cut the lead to 31-19. The Crimson recovered swiftly, and tries by Fields, senior scrumhalf Cassidy Bargell and sophomore fullback/wing Chloe Headland put the score out of reach at 48-19.
Headland also cited the great potential for growth going forward. “We’re excited to see ourselves grow more than anything from that game,” she said. “Obviously, we’re always looking to build our basic game. The basic plays of rugby and just improving our own personal ability. That’s always been a big focus of our team, you know, being the best of yourself…We fine tune everything that went well and we see what else can be done so as it goes on, by the end of it we’re hitting our max.”
A strong team showing was highlighted by standout performances from the first-year class. Back row/wing London showed out in her first career home game with three first half tries, while outside back Fields and center/fullback Padhilla added tries of their own. London, Fields, and Padhilla’s quick assimilation bodes well going forward in a season where the team is welcoming ten new recruits, as well as two walk-ons.
“The incoming class has been absolutely awesome,” she said about first-year performance in the game. “They came on and they’re all so eager to wear the jersey and I think we saw that on the weekend with how well they all did….Just playing their game and being able to control it and working with those who are next to them…It’s pretty exciting to see what that class is gonna do. It’s a big class but it’s definitely a very very talented class.”
Looking forward, the Crimson has high hopes for the coming season. The 15s’ third-place finish at Nationals and a second-place finish in the Ivy League, as well as a USA Rugby 7s National Championships semifinal appearance and Ivy League 7s tournament championship for the 7s in the spring has left the program eager to continue its string of success.
“Last year was a good year. We made it to the [semifinals],” said Headland of the team’s expectations this season. “I think the team overall was a little disappointed that it wasn’t a final finish, because at the end of the day, we all hope to make it to the final. So everything, all the work we put in, all of that, it goes into playing in that final game, whether that be a first-place finish or a second-place finish, so it's definitely the same [expectation] this year.”
If Harvard can advance that far, the 2022 NIRA National Championship Semifinals will take place the weekend of Nov. 12 with that coveted title game the following Saturday.
The 2022 campaign marks a milestone for the women’s rugby program, as it celebrates its 40th season across club and varsity levels this year. The Crimsonwill host Princeton in its alumni game on Sept. 24, when it is expected to draw a significant crowd.
Harvard plays again this Saturday, Sept. 17, away against Mount St. Mary’s in Emmetsburg, Md. at 12 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students understand the importance of starting every semester strong, so perhaps it is no surprise that on the football field, the Crimson has an 18-9 record in season openers under head coach Tim Murphy, who is entering his 29th season at the helm. On Friday night, Harvard will open the new campaign under the lights, as it welcomes Merrimack College for a 7 p.m. clash at Harvard Stadium. In 2021, the Crimson started off the season almost impeccably, gouging Georgetown on the ground for 335 yards and four touchdowns in a 45-9 victory in Washington. This season, Harvard hopes to continue its success in the friendly confines of Harvard Stadium, where it has not lost a home opener since 2000. Its 20 consecutive victories in home openers gives it the second longest active streak in the NCAA’s Football Championship Subdivision, behind only the 24 straight wins produced by North Dakota State.
Despite the Warriors playing their home games in North Andover, Mass., roughly 30 miles from Harvard Stadium, the two schools have never met on the field. Merrimack, after finishing with a 5-6 record last season, is 1-1 so far in 2022. The Warriors started their season on Sept. 2 with a 31-17 loss to No. 16 Holy Cross before bouncing back in dominating fashion, as it raced out to a 21-0 first-quarter lead and never looked back in a  45-17 trouncing of Assumption.
In the victory over the Greyhounds, it was Merrimack’s defense that did most of the damage, swarming Assumption quarterbacks Jack Cady and Ryan Yost to the tune of three interceptions and a forced fumble. These turnovers turned out to be costly, too; the Warriors’ four takeaways resulted in 14 points, including a 40-yard return for a touchdown by defensive back Garry Rosemond Jr. in the first quarter. It was the second straight game that the sophomore has recorded an interception, and he also finished second for Merrimack with six tackles. In 2021, Harvard did a good job protecting the ball, throwing just eight picks in 10 games, but it will have its hands full with Rosemond, graduate student linebacker Rodney Samson, and junior defensive back Shayne Butler, who picked off two Greyhound passes. The Warriors also did a stellar job pressuring the quarterback, racking up 14 tackles for a loss last weekend, including five sacks. The Merrimack pass rush is led by junior defensive lineman Nicholas Lenon, an All-NEC Second Team selection in 2021 who contributed a sack and two tackles for a loss against Assumption.
“[Negative plays] hurt, but we’ve got a great [offensive line],” senior quarterback Charlie Dean said. “We’ve got good young guys in there, ready to compete, and I’m excited to see what they can do on Friday night.”
Indeed, the Crimson offensive line was a strong unit last season, allowing running backs Aaron Shampklin (who earned an All-Ivy First Team nod in 2021) and Aidan Borguet (Second Team) to be the most prolific backfield tandem in the Ancient Eight. Although star Spencer Rolland graduated and transferred to the University of North Carolina, senior offensive lineman Alec Bank was one of 12 Harvard players to earn a spot on a preseason All-Ivy Team, picking up a First Team projection. Bank and the rest of the offensive line will be tasked with protecting Dean, who re-earned his starting role after suffering a season-ending injury at Princeton in 2021. The Odessa, Fla. native completed 55% of his passes in 2021 for 604 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions.
“It’s been a long time coming,” said Dean on his rehabilitation process. “Just working every day to get back to where I was before and even better than that, so just excited [for the] opportunity to go play football again.”
Dean will have his fair share of weapons to choose from on the offense. Borguet, now the feature back for offensive coordinator Mickey Fein’s unit after Shampklin’s graduation, looks poised to build on his stellar 2021 campaign, having been tabbed as Phil Steele’s Preseason Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Last season, Borguet took his 115 carries for 602 yards and eight touchdowns. In addition, Dean will have a combination of speed and size in his wide receiver corps, with six-foot speedster Kym Wimberly returning for his senior season and six-foot-three junior Kaedyn Odermann returning from a season-ending injury. First-year wide receiver Cooper Barkate was a top recruit coming out of Mater Dei, listed as the tenth best wide receiver in California by Rivals.com. Wimberly, Odermann, and Barkate will have to replace the contributions of Demarkes Stradford, Adam West, and B.J. Watson, three players who made significant contributions for the Crimson in 2021 but graduated in the spring. Senior tight end Haven Montefalco was also listed on the Preseason All-Ivy Second Team.
Despite all the playmakers on Harvard’s offense, Scott Larkee ’99’s defense is arguably a stronger unit. After racking up national top-ten ranks in 11 different major statistical categories in 2021, the Crimson returns many of its stars in 2022. Senior defensive back Alex Washington, who turned in an All-Ivy First Team performance last year, senior safety James Herring and senior defensive back Max Jones lead a big and athletic secondary that could prove problematic for opposing passers. Yet, despite the apparent risks of airing it out against such a talented group, opposing offenses would arguably fare worse running the ball, as Harvard put up the best rushing defense in FCS last season. Although Jordan Hill, whose 242 career tackles rank fourth in program history, graduated, the linebacker corps, led by seniors Jack McGowan, Matt Hudson, and Solomon Egbe, still contains plenty of talent. Up front, junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith – a finalist for the Jerry Rice Award, given to the top first-year player – in 2021 will be flanked by a pair of fellow Preseason All-Ivy honorees in senior defensive linemen Nate Leskovec (First Team) and Truman Jones (Second Team). Leskovec recorded 6.5 sacks in 2021 and Jones will serve as the 148th Captain of Harvard Football this fall.
“Those guys up front reload year after year,” said McGowan of the defensive line. “Up front is probably our biggest strength heading into the season.”
On Friday, the Crimson will face a big, dual-threat quarterback in the Warriors’ Jack Zergiotis, who appeared in ten games in 2019 for Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) side Connecticut, completing 54% of his passes for 2,107 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions across two seasons for the Huskies. Although not much of a runner at UConn, the six-foot-two Canadian has taken on a bigger responsibility with Merrimack, carrying the ball 18 times and scoring one touchdown on the ground in the first two games of the season. He has been effective passing the ball as well, completing 27 of his 55 passes (49%) for 348 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception so far this season.
“He’s a really good athlete,” McGowan noted. “Containing him, whether that’s with our defensive ends off the edge, keeping him inside the pocket, and then really good blanket coverage on those guys that he’s looking for. The biggest thing, I would say, is limiting his ability to scramble and run with the ball.”
In their win over Assumption, the Warriors relied on a committee approach to the running back position, pairing Tyvon Edmonds Jr.’s 12 rushes with significant contributions from Victor Dawson, Matt Brehon, and Zergiotis, pounding the Greyhounds’ defensive front to the tune of 135 yards and a pair of scores. When Zergiotis takes to the air, his top target will be star wideout Jacari Carter, who earned All-NEC First Team honors as a freshman in 2021 and, with 89 catches, fell just four receptions shy of Super Bowl LVI MVP Cooper Kupp’s freshman receptions record, set in 2013.  Flanking Carter on the outside, Merrimack also includes wide receivers Hayden Fisher and Jelani Mason. In the middle, senior halfback Tyler Roberts will look to build on a brilliant 2021 campaign that saw him haul in 52 passes for 535 yards and six touchdowns en route to an All-NEC First Team position.
“Their offense is good,” McGowan said. “Big [offensive line], good FBS transfer quarterback, good tight ends, good run game, couple of quick slot receivers. We’ll have our hands full, but I think we’re always going to be ready to play.”
Ready or not, here the season comes for Harvard. In just two days’ time, fans will come rushing into Harvard Stadium to celebrate Community Night. With roaring stands filled with crimson and white, the Crimson will hope to open its season strong. Last year, in its home opener, Harvard treated its fans to a 49-17 victory over Brown, a game in which the Bears were never competitive. The Crimson will try to give the student body another early-semester gift this time around, but Dean knows that how it is received depends on the play of his team.
“If we play good, it’s going to be a good atmosphere. If we play bad, it’s going to be a bad atmosphere,” he said. “So it’s really up to us to determine what the atmosphere is, and hopefully we can give the fans a good show on Friday night.”
Tickets to the game are available on GoCrimson.com, but for Harvard fans unable to make it to Harvard Stadium, it will also be broadcast on ESPN+ and over the air by WRCA on 1330 AM, 106.1 FM, and 92.9 FM HD-2.

When we’re drowning in psets, essays, and the never ending cycle of club meetings, staying active (let alone finding time for yourself) is hard at Harvard. Check out these ideas to get those endorphins going!
Start a free, one week trial at CorePower
Sign up for a free trial online, then head over to the CorePower on JFK Street! One week, unlimited classes. This trial isn’t limited to the Harvard Square location, check out the nearby locations at Kendall Square and Allston, or venture into Seaport or Back Bay. I highly recommend trying Yoga Sculpt - you’ll emerge looking like you jumped into a pool but it’s a butt-kicking workout that includes cardio, weights, and stretching.
Sign up for a free class at Pure Barre 
Yes, the workout place you pass on your way to Flour. If you want to feel not only mentally depleted from classes but physically depleted as well, this is for you! Grab a friend and sign up on the website - tl;dr your abs will feel like somebody ripped them out, ground them up, then placed them back inside your body. Don’t blame me when you wake up with intense soreness before your weekly 9 a.m.
Take advantage of Memorial Drive on the weekends 
Memorial Drive is closed to cars on the weekend, so you have an entire street to walk, jog, bike, or roller skate on! Text a friend on a sunny Saturday, grab iced lattes and take a catch-up stroll or indulge in a solo hot girl walk.
Go bouldering at the Central Rock Gym 
Newly opened this fall and above the new Jefe’s, the Central Rock Gym is an awesome solo workout, with a friend, or with a big group of friends. In addition to the giant bouldering wall, they offer yoga classes, treadmills, ergs, weights, and an assortment of other machines with a community feel and fun music to pump you up! (Pro tip: If your group is 10+ people, schedule ahead to receive a discounted group rate. They also have a discounted rate for people under the age of 22).
Invest in 4 weeks of Down Under School of Yoga for $49
You pass it when you splurge on a $13 salad at Life Alive, but you have yet to try it. Classical yoga, yoga sculpt, Pilates, Barre - they’ve got it all. Down Under also offers a discounted student membership that includes 20% off Life Alive! Helloooo Falafel Power salad and hummus.
Get moving during workout Classes at the MAC and Hemenway
Harvard Recreation offers many classes - free of charge! With tons of offerings from BollyX, Zumba, Cycle, to Row and Sculpt, I’m certain you’ll find one that fits into your already packed Gcal.
Walk to Trader Joes or the Porter Square Target
Two birds with one stone: check a workout and an errand off your to-do list. Listen to a podcast (or the lecture you skipped) on your way — at Harvard, multitasking is practically an instinct. While you’re at it, grab some Pumpkin JoJo’s to share with your roommates, or replenish the communal bag of popcorn you finished.
My biggest tip is to make exercise as important as doing a homework assignment. If you don’t prioritize it — it won’t happen! Taking care of your body (and liver after each weekend) and mind (after those heinous psetting hours) will pay off, I promise :)
