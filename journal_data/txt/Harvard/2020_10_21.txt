After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disputes over Amy Coney Barrett’s Catholic faith — as her Supreme Court confirmation hearings unfold — obscure, more than anything, a dearth of discussion around the role of religion in the American national identity. While Barrett’s confirmation is out of our hands, the future of living in a multifaith community isn’t, and the fact that religion is often a site of political contestation in the United States urges us to reassess our assumptions about religious belonging, whether we identify as explicitly religious or not. Can a Supreme Court justice practically believe in a religious truth without imposing it on anyone else?
An oft-cited postulation about the way society should accommodate unique, opinionated humans in functional, societal roles is Immanuel Kant’s theory of “private and public reason.” In Kant’s view, the free use of reason, and by extension declaring and acting upon personal opinions, should be limited to the public sphere, since citizens have an opportunity to engage in productive dialogue over those opinions. In the private sphere, nonetheless, citizens should keep to the status quo. Preventing anarchy, and the instability of important institutions, is a priority for Kant.
But it’s no secret that abstract dichotomies cannot, by themselves, bridle the multidimensionality of American civics, and Kant’s framework is no exception. For one, it assumes that humans are capable of perfectly compartmentalizing their jobs from their values and opinions. It assumes that every human being has equal access to some sort of intellectual public sphere, and that every voice will be heard. Most of all, it assumes that there exist no human responsibilities for which the private-public boundary disintegrates. For instance, a justice of the Supreme Court exists under certain traditions and authorities, and yet is called upon by the very nature of her office to argue in favor of her opinions — even if those opinions could unsettle collective consensus or experience.
The Supreme Court, however, is not the only office that purposefully splinters Kant’s compartmentalizations. I am convinced that religion and its underlying values permeate so much of American social consciousness that to neglect it is to fundamentally misunderstand what motivates, delights, disillusions, and ultimately changes people living in the current day. This is true not only for civic office. It is true for medicine and end-of-life care, zoning laws and city architectures, Sunday post office closure, science teaching in public schools, the calendar year, and our definitions of art and classical music, among a myriad other shared, experiential truths. And, importantly, it is also true that the contours of Christian America — however powerful, however resistant — have been reshaped and enriched by diverse faiths and traditions for decades. Strands of Jewish, Hindu, or Muslim influence, for instance, might be more difficult to pick out in rural Missouri, where my family lives, but in more diverse parts of the country, they are blooming, vibrant, even obvious. The idea of a pure, reigning secularism, the idea that faith communities are cleaved by thick, concrete walls — and the implicit notion that the influence of religious value or truth might actually be a rare, menacing threat as opposed to a simple fact of the American reality — are illusions of complacency perpetuated by the American conscience.
Should a justice of the Supreme Court do away with separation of church and state? Should she do away with her religious belonging? No, neither. What I hope Amy Coney Barrett has done, and incidentally what I hope everyone does, is make friends with people who are different from her. If you’ve ever loved someone different in any way from yourself, you know that two unique beings can happily neighbor each other. My peers in Harvard interfaith forums, for instance, engage in dialogue comfortable with the assumption that our traditions have sometimes been in conflict. Because I have come to love these people, these incongruities are wonderful, even instructive. Without them, I would know no nuance, never have a meeting gently interrupted by a Muslim friend who needs to go pray, or know what to say on Yom Kippur to my teaching fellow. And without feeling a personal stake in diversity, there are few ways to make sense of the way America, said to stand atop mythic, absolute pillars, often contradicts itself.
Interacting with a diverse set of people — interfaith, interracial, interethnic, and otherwise — normalizes and humanizes markers of difference without minimizing them, and it also makes them mutually relevant. What sort of truth would it have to be, a truth that didn’t impose anything on anyone else? Given the complexity of the relationship between American religious values and our political system, we can only hope that it will be a loving one, one that takes into account the dynamism of contemporary religious belonging, and empathizes not with generalized systems of thought but individual human beings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Embattled Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber is known for many things: conducting groundbreaking nanoscience research, growing a giant pumpkin (the 17th largest in the world in 2014), and, most prominently, for his recent arrest by federal authorities for allegedly lying to the United States government about funding he received from the Chinese government.
Now, Lieber is suing Harvard for not covering the legal fees associated with his criminal lawsuit, pointing to Harvard’s indemnification policy. According to Lieber’s complaint, Harvard policy states that the “University shall indemnify a Qualified Person acting in a Covered Role.” The complaint states that in March of this year, Lieber requested that Harvard indemnify his legal fees, which the University denied, prompting Lieber to file suit.
In denying Lieber’s request, Harvard pointed to a clause in the University’s indemnification policy which states that a “Qualified Person” can be denied compensation if they are “determined not to have acted in good faith.” This “good faith” justification does not sit well with us. After all, the case itself is at least in part predicated on whether Lieber acted in good faith with respect to his role at and responsibilities to Harvard. And while if he is found guilty it would seem difficult to argue he acted in good faith, if he’s cleared of the charges, won’t Harvard’s indemnification decision be flat-out wrong?
Perhaps this would all make sense if it were the University suing Lieber; given the nature of the charges, it arguably could. But it’s not, which suggests something altogether more serious: For the University, so thoroughly steeped in federal funding, there can be no question of good faith when the security of American knowledge is at stake. Lieber’s indemnification claim is really just a nonstarter.
Despite the difficulty of their application in his case, it bears noting there’s a reason these indemnification policies exist in the first place. And though we recognize there are cases where the University footing the bill for its employees’ legal fees feels uncomfortable — say, a student sues a faculty member alleging sexual misconduct — the ultimate purpose of the policy is to protect University employees from legally-mediated harassment. In general, Harvard professors must be able to conduct research without fear of legal retribution. An indemnification policy is a crucial part of protecting academic freedom.
The indemnification policy, however, also allows Harvard to protect itself. The policy benefits the faculty members, but by protecting the reputation of its employees, Harvard also protects its own reputation. Selective application of the indemnification policy — the choice to cover the legal fees of some faculty and not others — makes it completely self-serving. Looking beyond the specifics of Lieber’s case, should the University so easily be able to wash their hands of employee protections when they present a public relations problem?
By refusing Lieber the indemnification he claims that was guaranteed in his contract, Harvard is protecting its own reputation. The University does not want to be publicly connected to Lieber because being tied to secretive Chinese funding, academic espionage, and the new cold war between the United States and China is not a good look. So Harvard refuses to indemnify him.
But Harvard has yet to fire Government Preceptor David D. Kane for the racist blog posts he does not deny authoring, as so not to be accused of restricting free speech and giving in to “cancel culture.” Many of the University’s hiring, firing, and, it seems, indemnification decisions are similarly designed to protect the University’s reputation. As a result, Harvard’s brand may soar in the eyes of some, but only at the cost of its values.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of experts in psychiatry, business, and leadership development discussed the complexities of supporting the mental health of young people of color in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic at a School of Public Health event Tuesday.
The event, titled “Innovating in the Workplace: Supporting Mental Health of a Young People of Color During COVID-19 and Beyond,” marks the latest installment in the School of Public Health’s “Policy Controversies” series. The School of Public Health’s The Forum partnered with the Steve Fund and GBH News to host the online event.
Phillip W. Martin, a senior investigative reporter at the GBH News Center, moderated the event.
Panelists included Linda Akutagawa, president and CEO of Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics; Damien A. Hooper-Campbell, the chief diversity officer at Zoom; Joan Steinberg, president of the Morgan Stanley Foundation; and Sarah Y. Vinson, founder of the Lorio Psych Group and associate professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine.
The online event highlighted the Steve Fund’s analysis of data on the mental health of young people of color during the coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking about the data, Martin said that “according to the CDC, 30 percent of Black and 35 percent of Hispanic people polled reported experiencing symptoms of trauma and stress-related disorders like PTSD as a result of the pandemic.”
Martin added that current events such as recent incidences of police brutality also played a role in exacerbating the anxieties that people of color experience.
Panelists also discussed objectives companies should meet to support and accommodate new employees — especially employees of color.
Vinson said employers can foster diversity by developing a specific mindset. She said they should be “thinking about the fact that it’s not just one box, but that each person brings these different categories and that there’s interplay between them.”
From there, Vinson said, employers should find ways to get to know their employees “and then support them in a way that makes sense for them from an intersectional standpoint.”
“In this time, there are already so many problems with our economic situation in terms of everyone entering the workforce, but students of color, of course, face particular challenges and inequities that are just exacerbated by the pandemic,” said Lisa Mirowitz, the Executive Producer and Director of the Leadership Studio at the School of Public Health, who helped organize the event.
In an interview before the event, Akutagawa discussed the importance of the panel's topic.
“Mental health is an issue that is oftentimes not spoken about,” she said. “Relative to many other people, we find that particularly young adults of color are less likely to speak about mental health issues, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.”

Harvard Kennedy School plans to offer a hybrid of in-person and remote classes to its students for the spring semester, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email Tuesday.
Although the school’s executive education program continues to be “fully remote,” the school will offer a “small number of in-person classes to a limited number of students,” Elmendorf wrote. The Kennedy School also plans to allow all “interested” students to spend a “modest” amount of time on campus.
Slots for in-person classes will be reserved for international students who do not currently hold U.S. visas. First-year international Master in Public Policy students will have the option to attend half of their class sessions in person, as will first-year international students currently without visas in the Kennedy School’s various Master in Public Administration degree programs.
The in-person course structure meets U.S. federal regulations for study to ensure international students will be able to apply for F-1 and J-1 visas, according to the email. However, the email notes that visa issuance and admission do not fall under Harvard's jurisdiction and encourages students to contact the Harvard International Office with concerns about their circumstances.
All international students will still have the option to continue their studies in a fully-remote format, along with HKS students in the United States.
In a shift from its fall policy, the Kennedy School will also allow all interested students limited access to campus in the spring, per Elmendorf’s email. The amount of time each student can access campus will depend on several factors, including the number of students who need to be on campus, the number of students who enroll in in-person courses, and the status of the pandemic in the Boston area.
Elmendorf wrote that HKS administration hopes each student will be able to spend “at least one day per week on campus,” and that the school will prioritize students not taking in-person classes.
The school is also developing a “Community Compact” before bringing students back to campus. The compact will include rules about mandatory mask-wearing, physical distancing, and regular testing. The compact will also require students to sign up in advance before entering campus facilities or attending campus activities.
Much like College students living in residence, students who do not comply with the compact may “lose their opportunity to be on campus.”
The College dismissed three first-year students living in Mather House after learning they hosted a party in the house with at least three other guests.
The Kennedy School will be running a campus access pilot program next month, according to Tuesday’s email.
Elmendorf wrote that he “deeply respects” staff and faculty concerns about their health in coming to campus but emphasized that the current spring plans only require “small numbers” of additional personnel. He said he is “hopeful” that those faculty and staff members who come to campus in the spring will feel “comfortable” partaking in on-campus activities.
Still, most Kennedy School faculty, staff, and fellows will continue to work from home in the spring. They will be eligible to voluntarily come to campus for “modest” periods of time with approval from their managers.
Elmendorf wrote he is excited for the spring semester but cautioned that HKS affiliates will need to be “flexible” as plans are subject to change should health conditions at the Kennedy School or in the Boston area worsen.
“I hope everyone understands that, as long as the pandemic continues, there are tradeoffs between the objectives we share, and no plans could accomplish everything we want,” he wrote.
Elmendorf also cited the Kennedy School’s mission to “improve public policy and public leadership,” and said he was confident that the members of the school will fulfill that goal.
“As I look at our faculty, staff, students, fellows, alumni and friends, I firmly believe that our capability for advancing that mission has never been greater,” he wrote. “Let us proceed together.”

Harvard Law School, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Divinity School, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study will continue to hold their instruction and programming online next semester because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an announcement to students that it is “neither prudent nor equitable” for the school to resume in-person instruction for the winter or spring term.
The Law School made its decision in accordance with current public health considerations put forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Massachusetts state government, Manning wrote. He also noted that the school took “considerations of equity” into account when making its decision.
“Hybrid classes differentiate the educational experience among students not only on any given day, but also across the semester,” Manning wrote. “Such classes are not equally accessible to students who come from countries subject to a travel ban, who face other difficulties securing visas, who have family or personal obligations or challenges that compel them to remain where they are now, or who suffer from underlying conditions that place them at high risk of serious illness should they contract COVID-19.”
“Especially given the nature of our pedagogy, it seemed to us problematic to create a tiered experience in which only some of our community could engage in the forms of classroom instruction being offered,” he added.
The school is launching new initiatives — including creating more on-campus housing available and streamlining requests for class recordings — as it prepares for the online semester.
School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams wrote in an email to students and faculty that “the risks and uncertainty are simply too great to have everyone back on campus,” prompting the decision to extend remote learning through wintersession and the spring semester.
Still, administrators are “exploring options for limited on-campus access for students and faculty who have space needs,” Williams wrote.
The school will also continue to provide “augmented teaching support” and offer an opt-in pass/fail grading policy, per the email.
Graduate School of Design Dean Sarah M. Whiting wrote to affiliates that after “exhaustive scenario planning,” the school decided to continue with remote learning and prohibit building access through the spring semester.
“While this is not the choice I had hoped to be sharing with you, it stems from a number of factors: the rising infection rate in Cambridge, Somerville, and the rest of the Boston area; the challenge of making the single space of the trays truly safe; and the continued closure of U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide, making it impossible for many of our international students to obtain visas,” Whiting wrote.
The school is aiming to enhance remote learning via various initiatives, including a “real-time” view of activities at the school titled “GSD Now” and a website-building toolkit, in the coming months, per the email.
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton cited logistical concerns and continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic as factors in the school’s choice to stay virtual.
“Given this uncertainty, along with HDS's small classroom size—particularly while Swartz Hall is under renovation—and the challenges this presents to physically distance, HDS will conduct all spring 2021 courses online,” he wrote. “In so doing, the School seeks to maximize community safety and to allow students to make informed plans for travel, living arrangements, and enrollment.”
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study posted an update to its website stating due to risks associated with large gatherings and a resurgence of infections, its activities “will continue to be primarily virtual” through the end of the academic year.
“This includes public events and private programming, student opportunities, the Radcliffe Fellowship Program, and research services at Radcliffe’s Schlesinger Library,” the website reads.
Breaking from the other schools, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced on Tuesday that the school will use a “targeted-hybrid” approach in which “a limited number of students will be able to take a small number of courses with substantial in-person elements.”
Still, he wrote that “most classes will continue to occur remotely.”

Author and Boston University professor Ibram X. Kendi argued for the importance of anti-racism in research, especially in response to police brutality and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, during a Tuesday webinar hosted by Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research.
More than 700 people attended Kendi’s lecture, titled “On Antiracist Research: Its Approach, Its History, Its Impact.” In his presentation, Kendi — who is also currently a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies — emphasized the distinction between what he terms as racist and anti-racist research.
Kendi described three possible assumptions that researchers may hold regarding race.
“The first, there's something wrong with a particular racial group. The second, there could be something wrong with a particular racial group. And then the third, there's nothing wrong with any particular racial group,” he said.
Researchers who make the first or second assumption are engaged in racist research, while only those assuming the third are anti-racist researchers, according to Kendi.
Kendi was especially critical of researchers who make the second assumption in attempts to find an “objective” position between the explicitly racist and anti-racist assumptions.
“Last I checked, there's really no in between hierarchy and equality. There's no in between injustice and justice. There's no in between inequity or equity,” he said.
Kendi said researchers who make racist assumptions about certain groups are living in an “alternative world,” noting that there is no evidence to suggest that any racial group is “biologically inferior.”
Kendi explained that racism in research can lead to the creation of racist public policy, pointing to the example of mass incarceration.
Further, he said, racism in medical research can translate to negative health consequences for people of color. Kendi referenced a report by APM Research Lab which found that, as of mid-September, one in 920 Black Americans had died of COVID-19.
The lecture was the second of the Hutchins Center’s Virtual W. E. B. Du Bois Lecture Series, held as a webinar in lieu of its annual in-person events.
Maung T. Nyeu, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, attended the webinar and described it as “thought-provoking.”
“His words reminded me of the words of Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel,” Nyeu wrote in an email following the event. “‘We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.’”
Kendi concluded his remarks by invoking abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass — who advocated for the immediate emancipation of enslaved people — and arguing that a similar urgency is necessary to address systemic racism today.
“That's what we need to be demanding today: immediate emancipation from the terror and tyranny of racism,” Kendi said in his closing remarks. “We need anti-racist researchers to be asking, ‘How can we eliminate racial inequity and injustice?’”

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Tuesday interview that the success of Harvard’s residence program this semester has raised the possibility of bringing more students back to campus in the spring.
The College is currently in a “better place” in terms of containing the virus than administrators had initially anticipated when planning for the fall semester, Khurana said.
“Relative to what we were hypothesizing in terms of our models, frequent, high-cadence testing has proven to be effective in our residential community,” Khurana said. “This all bodes well for us to think about how we take the next step.”
Khurana added that Harvard’s “modest approach” to reopening campus — inviting only freshmen and select upperclassmen with extenuating circumstances back — has proven successful. As of Tuesday, the University reported just nine positive tests of undergraduates since June 1. This month, Harvard began reopening some campus common spaces to provide additional study space to undergraduates living in residence.
He added that the final results of the fall semester will shape decisions about the spring, including the shape of the academic calendar and the cohort of students in residence. Should Harvard invite students back to campus in the spring, the College will prioritize the senior class.
Khurana also emphasized that all spring planning is ultimately subject to Boston-area coronavirus case counts and trends.
“Our decision is very much contingent on a number of factors that are not in our direct control, but that we can all collectively impact,” he said.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay also said in an interview with The Crimson last week that Harvard affiliates’ compliance with health guidelines “bodes well” for the prospect of bringing “potentially even more students” back to campus in the spring.
Khurana noted, however, that while administrators have begun thinking about the spring term, the College’s most immediate priority is preparing for end-of-term move-out this semester.
While the College originally planned to invite up to 40 percent of students back to campus this fall, just 25 percent of students decided to live in residence. Students returning to campus agreed to follow strict safety protocols — organized under a Community Compact — which include frequent testing and limited social interaction.
The College also created a disciplinary body composed of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members — the Community Council — to enforce the compact and arbitrate alleged violations.
The Council took its first confirmed disciplinary action earlier this month when it sent home three first-year students living in Mather House for hosting a party in the building with at least three other guests.
A recent survey of undergraduates conducted by The Crimson found that 6 percent of respondents living on campus said they were unlikely or very unlikely to follow the College’s guidance about not attending large gatherings. Sixteen percent said they were unlikely to follow the rule about not inviting people to their dorm rooms.
Asked about the statistics, Khurana emphasized that the U.S. is facing a potential second wave of infection that puts the country’s “most vulnerable” at risk.
“I know that this has presented a personal inconvenience,” he said. “[But] the best way to manage a pandemic or a plague is simple human decency. And I believe that we are a decent community made up of decent people who want to do a decent thing.”
Khurana said he understands that students — like everyone — will make “mistakes and lapses.” Nonetheless, he said he is “grateful” for undergraduates’ generally strong adherence to the College’s health guidelines.
“Our students have turned out to be exactly the kind of people we hope they would be: responsible, caring, worried about their fellow citizens and community members,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From picnics on the banks of the Charles River to brass concerts in Cambridge Common, Harvard students living on campus have discovered new outlets to enjoy themselves outside of their stifling dorm rooms.
Undergraduates are beginning to flock to newly reopened common spaces such as the Smith Campus Center, Cabot Science Library, and Memorial Hall when they need a change of scenery.
L. Madison Pankey ’24 — currently living in Greenough Hall — said she had looked for places to study outside her suite since the semester began, opting for cafes around Cambridge. Since the Smith Center opened for individual study, however, she said she has spent time there nearly everyday, adding that she appreciates the separation between her room and study space.
“It's really awesome, actually,” she said. “I’m so happy they opened something up just because it’s really difficult to do your studying in the same place that you take classes, there’s just a lack of motivation.”
Naomi Davy ’22 said she has gone to the Smith Center in recent weeks, and said trying to study in her room is a “recipe for disaster.” Davy said she has also used the Malkin Athletic Center since it reopened for residential use in late September.
In addition to using indoor study spaces around campus, many students said they are taking advantage of the remaining weeks of warm weather to study and dine outdoors, including in House courtyards and by the river.
Amelia M. Cossentino ’23 and fellow members of the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra recently played a socially distanced brass players rehearsal in Cambridge Common. She said the impromptu recital made her “nostalgic” for practicing and performing in semesters past.
Cossentino also said her need to separate her living and studying spaces led her to explore new outdoor areas on campus.
“I think this definitely sort of urged me to explore a lot of the external spaces that are even just on campus, you don't have to go very far to find a lot of spaces I just hadn’t previously considered using,” she said. It’s really necessary to separate those mindsets of work and relaxation as much as possible.”
As fall wanes and the weather gets colder, however, students said they will look to move their study spaces indoors to escape the Cambridge winter.
Samantha M. Galvin ’24 said she frequents the Winthrop Courtyard when she needs to get away from her dorm room. As temperatures drop, however, the chairs were removed from the courtyard.
With the outside studying spaces gone, Galvin said she hopes common spaces in Houses and dorms will open to compensate.
“When it’s cold or raining, because I’m in a single, I go the whole day without seeing anyone,” Galvin said. “When it’s those types of days, it would be nice to have common spaces open so you can talk to the people you live around and just go somewhere that isn’t your room.”
Omolara “Lara” F. Dada ’24 said she also frequently uses outdoor College spaces, such as House courtyards, to spend time with friends, and called the opportunity to spend time outside her suite “liberating.” She added that outdoor spaces have brought her semester closer to what it might have been without COVID-19 restrictions.
“I think it’s definitely given us at least some semblance of a normal semester,” she said. “It’s definitely much much better than being at home, because at least there’s been the opportunity to meet people.”
“But it's definitely still challenging at times,” she added. “Sometimes you just want to just stay in your room and it feels like it's not worth it.”

A panel of public health experts discussed the social and political determinants of health in a Tuesday webinar co-sponsored by the offices of diversity and inclusion at Harvard Medical School, School of Dental Medicine, and School of Public Health.
The panelists tackled the origins of health inequities, from the history of discrimination in the United States to the role of voter suppression in public health policy.
Medical School Dean for Diversity and Community Partnership Joan Y. Reede and School of Public Health Professor David R. Williams moderated the event, which featured Daniel E. Dawes, the director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine. Three other panelists accompanied them: doctoral candidate Anna K. Hing from the University of California, Los Angeles’s School of Public Health, HSPH Professor Jose F. Figueroa, and Tuskegee University’s National Center for Bioethics in Research and Healthcare Director Rueben C. Warren.
Dawes opened the event by speaking about health disparities communities of color face which he said have been present “throughout our nation’s history.”
Higher rates of air pollution, lack of access to healthy foods, and increased stress are just some of the “social determinants” that have led to poor health among people of color, Dawes said.
But underlying these social determinants, Dawes added, are longstanding “political determinants” — upstream policy decisions that have perpetuated health inequity.
Dawes tied these political determinants to the country's long history of discrimination toward people of color. He described how politicians first used slavery and overt racism to justify creating laws that have perpetuated health disparities, later turning to less conspicuous racial discrimination methods after abolition.
“Racism does not sleep in this country,” Dawes said.
Following Dawes’s presentation, the full panel discussed the current state of American health policy, specifically considering how the value-based care system harms low income communities of color, as well as the healthcare workers who treat them.
“Every single value-based care program that has come out has, in its core DNA, some form of structural racism and discrimination,” Figueroa said. “These programs often reward and bonus providers who take care of the wealthiest and white populations.”
King focused on the health impacts of voter suppression, explaining that young adults who vote have “higher future incomes and better mental health.” She also emphasized the stigma placed on ineligible voters and discrimination towards voters of color. She said Americans need to “truly understand voter suppression as a form of structural racism meant to uphold white supremacy.”
Additionally, the panelists emphasized the connection between public health and social justice issues. Health disparities and health inequities are “different pieces of the same puzzle,” according to Warren, who also called attention to the importance of including oral health as a key part of health policy discussions.
In a Q&A session at the end of the webinar, speakers addressed questions about what actions clinicians and civilians alike can take to combat structural violence and health inequities.
King urged people to make sure the voices of people of color are “included, listened to, and respected” to prevent further marginalization of these groups in the policy-making process.
The panelists ultimately encouraged audience members to respond to the topics discussed throughout the webinar through civic engagement.
“My take-home message to you — hear me clearly — go vote. Please go vote,” Warren said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Educational Policy Committee extended the deadline for students to change a course’s grading basis between letter-graded and pass-fail to Nov. 16, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email to students Tuesday morning.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh first announced that the Educational Policy Committee was considering the change during an Oct. 7 faculty meeting. She wrote in a prior email to The Crimson that the EPC is “committed to ensuring that students have a good academic experience this year.”
The EPC considered the measure after the Undergraduate Council endorsed legislation on Oct. 4 proposing the College extend the drop and pass-fail deadline and allow courses taken as pass-fail to count for concentration and general education credit. The deadline is normally the fifth Monday of the semester, which this year fell on Oct. 5.
The UC legislation requested that the deadline be extended to Nov. 30, pointing to similar accommodations made by peer institutions such as Yale University and Princeton University this fall.
While the EPC extended the pass-fail deadline to Nov. 16, it did not extend the deadline to drop courses, nor did it change existing policies on when pass-fail courses may be counted for credit.
Claybaugh wrote in a Tuesday email to The Crimson that concentrations will determine whether they will count pass-fail courses for credit.
“The authority to determine whether courses count for concentration or program credit lies with the concentrations and programs, not with the EPC,” Claybaugh wrote.
In the spring, the committee adopted a universal emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system after all teaching went virtual and students pushed for accommodations. The committee elected to return to a normal grading system this fall, despite Harvard's decision to continue holding all classes online.
“We are going to have to work together as a community to find new ways of living and working until there's a vaccine,” Claybaugh said at a July town hall meeting. “And so we can't kind of put a pause on everything, including the giving of grades.”
In order to change their course to pass-fail grading status, students must submit a Change of Grading Basis Request Form through my.harvard and receive approval from their course instructor, advisor, and resident dean.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from Harvard, Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Columbia University Medical Center authored a review compiling over 160 references to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer.
Published online in earlier this month, the review summarizes five facets of cancer care that have been affected by the pandemic: the biological link between COVID-19 and cancer; testing for COVID-19 in cancer patients; changes to therapeutic, surgical, and medical cancer care delivery; clinical risk factors for COVID-19 in cancer patients; and COVID-19’s impact on cancer researchers and clinicians.
Jessica Hawley, a first author on the study and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University, said the review was inspired by a desire to create a concise and readable of information for cancer centers and community clinics to use as a “strategic framework” for treatment and risk mitigation in cancer and COVID-19 patients.
“The amount of publications out there on COVID is just very overwhelming,” Hawley said. “We wanted to pull together as much as we could.”
The pandemic has had significant negative effects on certain patient populations such as those with cancer, according to the paper: Evidence shows cancer patients are more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, develop a COVID-19 infection, and die as a result of COVID-19. A recent meta-analysis estimates that patients with active malignancy experience higher observed death rates from COVID-19 by approximately 25 percent. Previous estimates of the observed death increase ranged from 5 to 61 percent.
Despite potential adverse outcomes caused by COVID-19, cancer research has offered several promising approaches to treating the disease.
One of the most notable approaches involves cytokines — proteins secreted by the immune system that regulate inflammation — according to Ziad Bakouny, another first author of the paper and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard-affiliated Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
“We've been able to use all things that we have learned from the biology of cancer, and now we've tried to implement that to improve the care of patients with COVID-19,” Bakouny said. “Cytokine release syndrome is a syndrome that is a complication of some of the immune therapies used in the treatment of cancer.”
“These therapies are now being tried in the cytokine storm of COVID-19, which is very similar in terms of its pathophysiology,” Bakouny added.
The pandemic has also led to changes in patient care that could improve cancer care experiences, including increased flexibility and access to medical advice remotely via telemedicine, according to Hawley.
“One of the big takeaways for me personally is that in compiling all of these different references and papers and things, that we actually have learned some positive things in dealing with cancer care delivery during a pandemic,” Hawley said. “Cancer centers have, and community clinics also, have really taken different measures to help improve care and make things more flexible for patients and the lessons that we've learned in taking care of patients during the pandemic should be perpetuated forward.”
Jeremy L. Warner, another author of the paper and an associate professor of medicine and biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University, said the review lays the groundwork for future discussions of how COVID-19 may change patients’ treatments and outcomes.
“There's still a lot to understand about the survivors of COVID-19,” Warner said. “The question of whether the virus itself might affect their cancer trajectory, whether long term symptoms might alter their prognosis — those are the types of questions that we're going to be asking over the next months and years, really, and I think our review article sets the stage for that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge will open its warming center at a reduced capacity of 30 guests on Dec. 1 as a temporary shelter space option for homeless individuals this winter.
Located in the basement of the Cambridge Senior Center, the city has opened the center each winter since Jan. 2018 to “provide a welcoming, low threshold, indoor overnight service that will provide food, a safe place to rest, and protection from inclement weather,” according to its website.
When the warming center last opened from Dec. 2019 to April 2020, Bay Cove Human Services — a nonprofit organization that currently staffs the city’s temporary emergency shelter at the War Memorial/Spaulding Hospital — operated it seven nights a week from 7:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. for an average of 45 guests per night.
During the pandemic, the warming center will operate under social distancing guidelines. The city is also weighing keeping the center open during the day, according to an email from Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff.
“In the past, the warming center did not operate during the day, but in light of the current needs, we are reexamining those plans,” Semonoff wrote. “We are still working on what day time operations might look like.”
The Unhoused Advocacy Subcommittee of the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition — an advocacy group focused on issues of housing and homelessness in Cambridge — has met with city officials to push for initiatives to provide shelter to people who need it this winter.
Jessye Kass, director of the Cambridge Women’s Center and chair of the subcommittee, said opening of the warming center will not be sufficient to house people this winter because of reduced shelter options in the city. Several homeless shelters have had to shut down or run at reduced capacity during the pandemic.
“More day services are closed, and places where people used to be able to go — like Clover was open 24 hours, the airport, you could go and stay until 4 a.m., and they would do a sweep, or emergency room waiting rooms — all of these places that people went to stay alive at night in the winter when they couldn't get a bed are no longer available this year. And then there's a decrease in the bed count,” Kass said.
Members of the subcommittee have asked the city to consider expanding and adding new shelter spaces and sites for the season.
“The biggest concern among people who are unhoused that I’ve heard or people share is that there won’t be a place to go outside of the cold,” said Cassie Hurd, a member of the subcommittee and the executive director of the Material Aid and Advocacy Program.
If no new shelter spaces are offered this winter, the subcommittee anticipates that homeless people will die from the cold. Reverend Robin Lutjohann, another subcommittee member and minister at the Faith Lutheran Church, said “time is running short” and that more people are in need of spaces.
“I have to believe that if you decrease the sheltering space and increase the people and the needs, there's gonna be more people who are dead,” Lutjohann said. “And not to be overly dramatic, their blood would be on our hands.”
In addition to opening the warming center, Semonoff also wrote that the city is working with “various community providers to offer support as they look at ways that they might be able to expand or manage their services differently this winter.”
City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said he expects the number of people who experience housing insecurity in Cambridge will increase because of the pandemic-driven economic recession and the end of the statewide eviction moratorium.
“We’re going to have even more people out on the streets unprotected,” Zondervan said. “And the current solutions that the city is offering are just not sufficient to meet that need.”
