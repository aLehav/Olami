After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joseph Restic, the former Harvard football coach who led the Crimson to five Ivy League championships, died Thursday evening at the age of 85, Harvard University Athletics announced on Saturday.
Restic, who came to Harvard in 1971, collected 117 wins over his 23 seasons—an all-time record only recently surpassed by current football coach Tim Murphy.
According to the press release, Restic also served as president of the American Football Coaches Association in 1988. He was named the AFCA District 1 Kodak Coach of the Year in 1975.
A funeral Mass will be held on Tuesday at 10 a.m. at St. Mary’s Church in Milford, Mass. Burial will follow at St. Mary’s Cemetery. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, memorial donations should be made to the American Cancer Society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The student has become the master.
The Harvard women’s hockey team’s 5-2 victory over the University of New Hampshire on Friday night gave Crimson coach Katey Stone her second straight victory over her alma mater.
“Very strong game,” Stone said. “[We] came out ready to play tonight.”
Harvard (8-4, 6-2 ECAC) dominated the puck from the first whistle. The first line of forwards—which consisted of junior Jillian Dempsey, sophomore Lindsey Fry, and freshman Samantha Reber—was particularly effective at challenging the Wildcats (6-11-3, 0-6-2 Hockey East) and goaltender Moe Bradley, adding to the overall good play shown by the Crimson. Four minutes into the period, the first line efforts paid off. Junior defenseman and assistant captain Josephine Pucci fired the puck from the blue line toward Fry, who fired the puck at the UNH net. While Bradley made the initial save, Dempsey grabbed the rebound and stuffed it into the net.
“I just liked the pace of our game,” Stone said. “I thought our sense of urgency was good [Friday night].”
After Harvard drew first blood, UNH picked up its pace and gave the game a more back-and-forth feel, but the Wildcats were never able to significantly threaten the Crimson cage. As the period wore on, UNH’s attack wore off, and Harvard regained control.
With a little over a minute left in the frame, Crimson junior forward Kaitlin Spurling received the puck and skated it down to the left circle before sending it past Bradley to put Harvard up by two.
Seven minutes later, the Crimson had a three-goal lead when Reber knicked in a shot from classmate Sarah Edney 5:52 into the second period. Edney, a defenseman, had received the puck from Pucci, who had been directing play from the point.
“It was interesting because early on in our season, the defensemen were doing a lot of scoring,” Stone said. “They’re starting to pass it off to the forwards, which is good because it should be balanced.”
“It’s awesome to see everyone contributing,” Pucci added, “Getting more forwards scoring more goals—I think it’s a result of players getting more acclimated with each other.”
Three minutes later, Fry made it a four-goal advantage. The sophomore skated down the center lane of the ice before veering to the right circle, where she fired the puck past the unsuspecting Wildcat defense.
Fry’s goal proved to be a wake-up call to UNH, who again went on the offensive. This time it paid off. A scrum in front of the net caught all of Harvard’s skaters on one side of net, leaving Wildcat forward Nicole Gifford wide open on the other side.
UNH’s Kristina Lavole took notice and sent the puck behind the net to Emma Clark, who passed it to Gifford. While Crimson junior goaltender Laura Bellamy stopped Gifford’s first shot, Harvard was unable to clear the puck, which instead bounced back to Gifford. The forward put it away on her second attempt at 17:12 in the second frame.
Undeterred, the Crimson opened the third period with the same aggression it had shown all game.
“We responded well after that first goal,” said Bellamy, an assistant captain for the team.
This time, Harvard shifted its focus towards taking more shots, rather than waiting for the right opening.
“One of the things we talked about after the second period was we were over-passing,” Stone said. “I thought we did a great job of moving the puck coming up the ice, when it got into that tight scoring area … we kind of over-passed versus putting pucks in the net.”
The Crimson’s intensity paid off when Reber scored her second goal of the day off a cross-ice pass from Fry at the 7:46 mark in the third period.
Part of Harvard’s success came from its ability to stay out of the penalty box for its first 54 minutes of ice time. But in the final six minutes of the game, the Crimson’s skaters found their way to the penalty box, which gave the Wildcats the opening they needed to find the back of the net. Facing a 5-3 advantage, UNH’s Maggie Hunt scored with two and a half minutes left in the game.
“I’m disappointed with the fact that they got two goals because I thought we could have eliminated that,” Stone said. “Overall, we were penalty-free until the very end, which is really good for us.”
The victory was Harvard’s second in as many days, as the Crimson had defeated Providence in an away contest the night before. Harvard’s skaters now turn their attention to reading period and finals and won’t play another game until January.
“I think [performing well during reading period is] a testament to our preparation,” Stone said. “We gave them last week off so that they had plenty of time to study and rejuvenate … it wasn’t something that was a distraction to them at all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the weather outside gets colder, the Harvard men’s hockey team is staying hot.
The Crimson (4-3-3, 3-3-2 ECAC) picked up points for the sixth time in seven games with a 4-3 defeat of Princeton (4-8-2, 3-6-1) at Baker Rink on Saturday afternoon.
The win allowed Harvard to avenge the Tigers’ victory by the same score in Cambridge on Nov. 4.
The Crimson’s three man-up goals showed why it owns the country’s top power-play unit—boasting a conversion rate of 29.2 percent—and freshman goalie Steve Michalek recorded 31 saves to help Harvard stretch its unbeaten streak to four.
“It was our last game before break, and we just came in knowing we wanted to get a big win to go over .500 and to have a good taste in our mouths over the next month,” freshman defenseman Patrick McNally said. “It was a tough game, and we ended up coming out with the victory.”
Princeton’s Michael Sdao and Jack Berger were called for overlapping boarding penalties under two minutes into the contest, and McNally put the Crimson in the lead on the ensuing two-man advantage.
After senior forward Alex Killorn won a faceoff and then got the puck back from junior forward Alex Fallstrom, Killorn found McNally between the circles, and the rookie—the nation’s highest-scoring freshman defenseman—fired a shot past Princeton goalie Sean Bonar for the game’s first score.
“Killorn looked the goalie off and gave me a great pass in the center,” McNally said. “I just shot it, and it went in.”
Neither team could score for the rest of the period, with the Tigers’ Marc Hagel drilling a shot off the crossbar and Michalek making back-to-back saves on Berger to keep Harvard ahead.
Then, after Bonar stopped a one-timer by junior forward Luke Greiner 9:18 into the second, classmate Marshall Everson put back the rebound for another power-play goal—Everson’s third score in two games—to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
“It was a lot of broken plays put together,” Everson explained. “We tried a lot of different things out of the corner. They were pressuring really hard. ... [The puck] was just kind of laying in the crease, and I was able to knock it in.”
The Crimson defense held off the Princeton attack for most of the frame, until the Tigers’ offense picked it up as the period wound down. Hagel scored on a power play with just 56 seconds left, and after the subsequent faceoff, the Princeton captain beat Michalek again off a rebound just 12 seconds later to tie things up.
“We came out really strong and controlled the first and most of the second period,” Everson said. “The last five minutes or so of the second, I felt like we let them back into the game.”
But with one second remaining, Sdao was called for interference, giving Harvard another power play to start the third. The Crimson took advantage just 1:44 into the period, with senior forward Eric Kroshus taking passes from defensemen Danny Biega and Danny Ford before firing a low shot past Bonar.
Five minutes later, McNally head-manned the puck to Kroshus, who sent it to Biega. The junior fired a wrist shot over Bonar’s shoulder that bounced out so quickly that it didn’t register the red light. Though Kroshus put back the rebound, it was Biega’s goal that counted, giving Harvard a 4-2 lead.
“Danny’s got a great shot, and it ended up getting by the goalie,” McNally said. “That gave us a nice cushion so it was a big goal.”
Princeton’s Kevin Mills cut the deficit to 4-3 under a minute later with an unassisted score, but Michalek held off the Tigers’ push as the game wound down.
The goalie made a diving save on a Hagel shot with five minutes left, then stopped the Tigers’ Andrew Ammon in the final minute to give Harvard the win.
“They brought everything in the final few minutes,” Everson said. “But Steve made some really big saves there at the end.”
It was a critical victory for the Crimson, which held on despite being outshot, 34-26.
The team now has a 20-day break before resuming play again at North Dakota on December 30.At this point last season, the squad was just 2-8-0.
Now it is tied for third in the ECAC, thanks in part to the recent improvement of the freshman goalie Michalek, who was a sixth-round pick of the Minnesota Wild in this year’s NHL draft.
“Steve played unbelievably,” McNally said. “He’s basically the reason we were able to hold on in the end. He made some great saves and he really held them off for us.”

It's reading period, and after your ten-hour stint in Widener the other day, you're probably convinced that you never want to open another book again. We know this period can be pretty brutal, so we've put together a list of things worse than studying, in the hopes that it will inspire you to keep on working.
1. Finding a large cockroach in your room
A traditional 'River' experience, finding a cockroach is likely to consume several hours of screaming, running around, calling your Building Manager, and otherwise being unproductive. On the flip side, if this does occur, the terror and adrenaline will hopefully help you write that paper faster.
2. Finishing your paper at home
You know all you want to do is play with your puppy rather than make that Christmas Eve deadline (for that one class where your teacher is pretty lax about deadlines...)
3. Being woken up by the fire alarm during reading period
Ask the people in DeWolfe and Adams: There's nothing like an evacuation to ruin your three refreshing hours of sleep.
4. Getting kicked out of formal
Let's be honest. Formal was the only thing you were looking forward to this past week. For those unfortunate enough to have struggled in the art of the six-inch Louboutin, though, the event pretty much sucked. At least you supported the HoCo budgets...
5. Feeling bored
It's really nice to have nothing to do for the first five or six hours, but any longer and you start feeling funny. Honestly, Harvard students don't handle boredom well—all too quickly we start itching for something to do. Which, ironically, makes studying not so bad after all.

Today marks the end of reading period, which means that many of us are looking forward to watching, avoiding, or joining in on Primal Scream tonight. Here are a few songs to help you get in the mood.
1. Christina Aguilera: "Not Myself Tonight"
Unless you're an exotic dancer, exposing this much skin is probably unlike you. This is the night for you to own it and assert that you "don't give an AWHOO!"
2. M.I.A.: "Galang"
There's going to be plenty-a-jiggle going down tonight, so why not embrace what your mozzarella sticks have given you and shake and shimmy to this hit from Sri Lanka?
3. Right Said Fred: "I'm Too Sexy"
"I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts." Enough said.
4. Gunther & the Sunshine Girls: "The Ding Dong Song"
You'll be bumping into a lot of "tra-la-la" and "ding-ding-dong," so be prepared with this sleeper hit.
5. Miley Cyrus: "See You Again"
A final song for those who aren’t actually partaking in the debauchery, but watching instead. Some of what you see may haunt you for the rest of your life. Here's a friendly reminder that you do, in fact, have to see these people again. To those out there who prefer to stand on the sidelines, you've been warned.

Although you may have been hoping to see your first snow this year (let's face it, the light flurries around Halloween don't count), it's almost the end of the semester and Harvard has not yet transformed into a magical winter wonderland. As the time runs out for you to make snow angels and build your own version of Frosty, don't worry! Even though there's no snow, there are still ways that you can bring in the holiday season.
1) Now that finals are almost over, you know you're just going to forget everything by next year anyway. Put those soon-to-be-worthless notes to good use with some holiday fun!
a) Build a snowman out of your notes from the year. It's a great way to say goodbye to the hundreds of handouts that are crowding your desk.
b) Take all of your extra notes and put them in the shredder. Then use your new paper confetti (aka fake snow) to make snow angels. If you spread the shreds out across your dorm floor, you and your friends can have fun pretending that it's a white Christmas after all.
c) You can even make paper snowballs. Hundreds of handouts equal hundreds of fake snowballs. Just bundle up and have an epic snowball fight with your friends. Remember to pick up your snowballs and recycle them afterward.
2) Even though you can't build a real igloo, just pretend that the Occupy dome is the giant icy home you've been dreaming of.
3) When it's snowing, you want to be curled in front of the fireplace, sipping hot chocolate while cuddled under a blanket, right? Just because the skies are clear now doesn't mean you can't cut out snowflakes and tape them to your windows and draw fake flames for your boarded-up fireplace. Now as you snuggle under your blanket, you can watch the dancing snowflakes on your windowpane and the flickering fire in your room.
4) If you really feel like doing traditional winter activities, head down to the Frog Pond on the Boston Common to ice skate. It may not be Rockefeller Center, but the chilly temperature and holiday decorations will help you feel like it's really winter.
5) Go caroling around your dorm. Singing tunes like "Frosty the Snowman" and "Deck the Halls" will make it feel like December. Even if you can't run "over the hills of snow" with Frosty, you can still belt your heart out about it.
