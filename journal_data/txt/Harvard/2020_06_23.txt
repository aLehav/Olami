After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adjusting to the shift to remote education after the campus evacuation in March was difficult for everyone. Professors struggled to adapt to Zoom, club activity wrenched to a standstill, and student engagement essentially fell off a cliff.
Last Monday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay offered us a vague promise of a partial return to campus. The plan highlighted by Dean Gay, which is one of three options still under consideration, would leave 60-70 percent of undergraduates fully remote for at least the fall semester. Furthermore, regardless of the decision about residential life, almost all classes will be fully remote, at least for the fall. Before further decisions are made, however, we need to seriously consider what our tuition is paying for and the resources needed to maintain the quality of our education.
There is no denying that online classes are of a lower quality than a traditional college education. A Brookings Institute study comparing the shift to online education at a four-year college concluded that the least-prepared students are disproportionately negatively impacted. On average, the drop in grading for a single course is equivalent to the shift from a B-minus to a C. In the long run, grade point averages in one subject area can drop by as much as 0.42.
Several structural issues remain in place moving into next semester, stemming from a lack of transparency. We know administrators like Registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael P. Burke are working hard to address these concerns, but their plans and processes have not been made clear to students.
There’s been no word on how the College plans to address inequitable access to technology and WiFi among students. No one knows how decisions about who is permitted to return to campus will be made, engendering concerns of unfairness. Questions over how international students are to adapt to time-zone issues with live classes still haven’t been answered. And there’s been worryingly little clarity on the remote obligations of academic and thesis advisors.
Besides introducing discrepancies in living and learning environments, online education also deprives us of one of the biggest attractions of a Harvard education: the life-changing relationships we form with our classmates and professors.
Harvard requires students to participate in an unlimited meal plan because the “warmth and vibrance of our dining halls foster life-long friendship networks and engender the intimate feeling of family and community.” After spending even part of a semester remotely, we agree with Harvard: It’s impossible to replicate these substantive relationships that only occur in-person and on-campus.
But those life-long networks begin in the classroom, not the dining hall. And just as our meal plans pay for more than food, our tuition pays for more than classes.
Taking all of this together, it’s clear that an online education is simply worth less than a traditional one. But don’t take our word for it. Take Harvard’s.
An online undergraduate education looks remarkably similar to the Extension School, which offers an online degree program to students who are living at home and who often have significant career and family obligations. Based on the Undergraduate Council’s comparison of Extension School courses to Harvard College courses, there are at least 150 identical or nearly identical courses and at least 95 more that are roughly equivalent. These courses are a good representation of the breadth of Harvard’s course offerings, ranging from large lectures (Economics 10: “Principles of Economics”) to intimate seminars (“Arrivals: British Literature from 700 to 1700”).
For each of these identical classes, a remote Harvard College student paying full tuition last year would have paid over $5,966.25 per class, while students at the Extension School paid just $1,840 per class — a mere 31 percent of our tuition.
What does this $4,126.25 per class tuition premium pay for? It can’t be resources. Extension School students are offered a number of resources also offered to Harvard College students, including personalized academic and career advising, access to the Writing Center and Harvard libraries, and several clubs that overlap with undergraduate student organizations. Any additional resources offered to undergraduates (House tutoring systems, Counseling and Mental Health Services, Harvard University Health Services, etc.) all come out of the Student Services Fee and various health-related fees separate from our tuition.
So, the $4,126.25 tuition premium can only pay for two intangible things: the brand of Harvard College and the “life-changing moments and conversations” we have with our peers.
Shifting online might not reduce the value of the Harvard College brand, but it does severely diminish, if not fully impede, our ability to make connections. Though it’s hard to place a numerical value on these intangibles, if we value both equally, it’s only ethical for Harvard College to reimburse students approximately $2,000 per class, or $16,000 for the academic year — one half of the tuition premium.
Ultimately, if Harvard cannot guarantee the essentials of an equitable, high-quality education — a fair and transparent return-to-campus lottery, equal access to classes regardless of students’ location, a solution to WiFi inequity, accountable and accessible advising, and College-led facilitation of student engagement and interaction — we believe that a tuition reimbursement of approximately $16,000 for the upcoming academic year is the next best course of action.
We chose Harvard not just because it has the best education in the world, but also because it has the best people. It is our hope that, even remotely, every undergraduate continues to get the best of both.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 16, 2020, at 2:48 p.m.
Harvard Business School’s African American Student Union called on corporate leaders and executives to work towards racial justice within their organizations and in American society in an open letter published Friday.
The authors of the letter acknowledged the influx of corporate statements in support of racial justice and the Juneteenth holiday and decried what they dubbed “performative corporate activism.”
“During this month, companies are also raising their Pride flags but failing to acknowledge the growing number of Black trans men and women who are being killed across the country,” the authors wrote.

The authors also noted the lack of representation of Black Americans in the upper echelons of American corporations.
“The American economic system of capitalism was built upon racial stratification and this insidious system has led us to today, wherein Black professionals hold just 3.2 percent of all executive or senior leadership roles, less than 1 percent of all Fortune 500 CEO positions, and receive 1 percent of all venture capital investment,” they wrote.
The Business School itself has long faced allegations of systemic racism within the school culture. Dean Nitin Nohria announced plans for an anti-racist initiative in a letter to HBS affiliates sent Monday.
The African American Student Union linked their quest for corporate justice to anti-racist efforts at the Business School in an emailed statement.
“We have been encouraged by the response from the business community so far and look forward to engaging with more corporate leaders. However, we do not take lightly the century of Anti-Black racism that has taken place on our campus at HBS and we believe these recommendations should also be applied within the HBS context,” they wrote. “We urge the HBS administration to incorporate our advice, and start by communicating a bold vision for the advancement of Black lives at HBS and beyond.”
Jan W. Rivkin, senior associate dean and chair of the school’s MBA program, praised the AASU’s efforts in an emailed statement.
“I admire our students’ efforts to call on corporate leaders to work toward racial justice in their organizations and in society. Moreover, I’ve read the letter carefully, understanding that the students’ guiding principles for equity can be applied to HBS itself, not just to private corporations," he wrote. "One reason we’re grateful to have AASU leaders as partners in taking action to move HBS forward on matters of race is that they bring us perspectives like these."
In the letter to executives, the authors asked business leaders to undertake a four-pronged approach to addressing issues of racial injustice in order “to ensure that this is the last generation of Americans who are forced to take to the streets to demand basic human rights for Black people.”
First, the authors urged executives to “escalate” concerns about racial justice to the CEO and board level by publicly disclosing racial equity data and implementing diversity initiatives.
The authors also call on business leaders to “calculate” the success of their diversity initiatives. They wrote that corporations should link leadership teams' success on racial equality initiatives to their incentive pay, “grow the pipeline of Black talent” for executive positions, and collect diversity and inclusion data to determine achievements.
In addition, the letter states that executives should “educate” themselves on the experiences of their Black employees and “lead by example,” demonstrating the “learning mindset they should exhibit as they navigate conversations about race.”
The authors wrote that corporations should also “advocate” for racial justice beyond their internal statistics. The letter advised corporations to appoint a task force to analyze and ultimately address “the role your company has played in perpetuating racist systems,” donate to anti-racist organizations, address disparities in wages and benefits, and align their lobbying efforts with racial justice.
The letter urges executives to attend “corporate racial equity office hours” with members of the AASU.
“America’s demographic future points inexorably towards a more diverse, multi-racial community. We urge you to wake up, step up, and lead your organizations and institutions towards that future. Let us together be a part of the solution,” the authors wrote.
