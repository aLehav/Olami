After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A blank stage offers limitless possibilities. The vast majority of acts opt for spectacles, for flashy visuals, lights or lasers, and screeching instrumentation and vocals to catch the attention of an amorphous festival crowd. Fortunately, Christine and the Queens is not like the vast majority of festival acts. The French pop artist’s intimately choreographed performance, strengthened by gentle banter and celestial vocals, created a different kind of spectacle. Trading stunts for close physical touch, trust, and love, Christine and the Queens blurred the line between spectator and participant to build — in Chris's own words — a “small utopia” on Boston Calling’s Green Stage.
With an opening crescendo of synthesizers and subsequent gasp of the track “Comme si,” Chris (Héloïse Adelaide Letissier) and a group of dancers burst onstage in effortless coordination. “Backup dancers” isn’t an adequate description of the performers, whose movement proved integral to each beat of the set. With choreography reminiscent of the Viewpoints theatrical technique, Chris and her dancers shifted from careful contact to group dance and call-and-response movement, serving alternately as audience and performer for one another. Passing back and forth from stage right to left and back again, each individual paused to grasp another’s wrist, waist, head, or neck — the trust between bodies palpable as they explored the positive and negative space created by their constant movement. Crooning “‘Cause when you play me loud baby / We are making love / Now play me once again and let go” with her eyes trained on the audience, Chris wordlessly invited the growing crowd to join in the revelry.
While movement saturated the performance, Chris used the breaks between songs to create intimacy. “We need to reinvent everything,” she said, having just invited the audience to call her “Chris.” The connection between name as a representation of the self and reinvention is of great significance to the artist, who went through an intense period of personal exploration to construct and sink into the identity of “Chris.” In an interview with The New York Times, she referred to the identity she puts forth in her second album — aptly titled “Chris” — as “horny, hungry, and ambitious.” Onstage, Chris embodies and exudes all three traits, singing about sex, desire, and power. “I rule / Over all my dead impersonations / ‘Cause I’ve got it / I’m a man now,” she sang on “iT,” commanding masculinity and the power that comes with over a pulsing beat. In presenting gender and identity as constructs to be unapologetically experimented with, Chris offered a welcome counter-energy to a festival headlined — for the third year in a row — entirely by men. It is not uncommon for artists to preach self-acceptance during their sets, but few come across as genuine as Chris does. “There is no judgement here, there is is only love,” she said, and it was clear that this instruction was to be taken seriously. There would be no exceptions, no choice but to be oneself.
The singer’s movement and message collided in one striking performance after another. Blue smoke flooded the stage for the number “Tilted,” reducing the view of Chris and her dancers to that of silhouettes in a thick haze, guided only by the playful lilt of the chorus: “I’m actually good / Can’t help it if we’re tilted.” A brief ode to the joy of being “out” introduced the song, and the proudly queer artist couldn’t help but quip after her own chorus, “Aren’t we all?” A single dancer joined her for the song “Goya Soda,” during which the two repeatedly embraced and broke apart within a teal cloud of smoke. Chris’s voice wrapped itself around each verse and chorus, ranging from a clear belt to a soft, pseudo-rap and an airy falsetto. It’s ache stretched out over the consistently throbbing beat of each song, dictating the mood but refusing to sacrifice danceability in the process.
Chris herself, in all her whimsical kindness and charm, remained the focal point of the show. Whether in the thick of a dance or alone, facing away from the crowd and writhing along to the music, she could not be lost. Toward the end of her set, she paused to share an anecdote about a young man she witnessed being bullied for his “weird beauty” on the streets of Paris. “I do believe in weird beauty because it opens doors,” she said. “Fuck the norm!” She then climbed aboard the stage’s scaffolding to perform “Saint Claude,” ascending toward the rafters to serenade the man for whom she had not intervened. She held her red, button-down shirt out in front of her like an offering — taking the shirt off her back for the man and for all the people swaying below her. “We are so lonely / In this part of town,” she sang, her voice ringing out clear like a battle cry. As the scaffolding descended, she waved her shirt above her head like a surrender and slipped back onto the stage.
“My shrink says it is healthy to let it go,” Chris said before diving into her final number “Intranquillité.” Equal parts eccentric and elegant, euphoric and composed, Christine and the Queens let loose its “weird beauty” onstage, and Boston Calling was better for it.

EDM songwriter and producer Mura Masa’s eclectic techno beats and melodies are often enhanced by other artists’ vocals, as is the case with his most popular track: “Love$ick,” featuring A$AP Rocky. At his Boston Calling performance on Friday afternoon, touring singer Bonzai, now known as Cosha, stole the show with her vivid stage presence. Mura Masa offered an applaudable performance with a series of coveted tracks, but in part due to his main role as an instrumentalist and DJ and in part due to a perhaps more stage-shy personality, he receded into the background while Bonzai made the show worthwhile.
Mura Masa rarely looked out at the audience, instead gazing intently at his drums or mixer. He remarked upon the show-biz expression “The show must go on,” explaining that everything was going wrong with the set on the green stage. Few would have noticed had he said nothing, making the interjection strange given that he said little else. Nonetheless, while the massive displays flanking each side of the stage zeroed in on him, he played percussion impressionably, immersed in his music.
Bonzai, featured on his tracks “What If I Go?” and “Nuggets,” exhibited vocal prowess in her range and ability hold notes endlessly, but was too heavily autotuned on tracks such as “1 Night,” whose original version features Charli XCX. Bonzai, a natural performer, affirmed her enjoyment of the power of the stage, her expression strained by heartfelt singing but always coming back to a smile. She danced incessantly in a style inspired by hip-hop and perhaps other genres like dancehall while whipping her braids and making use of the entire stage, bringing an energy unparalleled by other festival acts. As she sang “Are U There?,” she asked the right side of the stage, “Are you here with me?” and then the left, involving the audience seamlessly via the lyrics of the song without the irksome “How are you, Boston?” calls heard at too many festival sets.
Mura Masa’s electronic music style is complemented by beautiful production his music videos, such as the stereoscopic cinematography in “What If I Go.” The videos feature streetwear-clad young people across scenes of urban storefronts and subway interiors. His album cover art, such as that of his latest album “Mura Masa,” additionally accents a distinctive font and modernistic graphics. A horizontal display across the back of the stage flashed snippets of each track’s corresponding music video, sometimes artfully cropped and sliding across the display. Flashes of the song title in black on a white background, then inverted, accompanied “What If I Go” and “Love$ick” in Mura Masa’s signature print.
For the most part, Mura Masa’s live music as he drummed, played keyboard, and DJed remained faithful to its recordings. While Bonzai’s live singing was merited in most songs, it would have served certain songs better to have their absent artists’ recorded voices seep through. With songs like “Love$ick,” for example, it was abysmal for so little of A$AP Rocky’s voice to be included after the words “FT. A$AP ROCKY” lit the display. In the original, A$AP Rocky’s verses are what make the song as good as it is, and there would be enough content for an audience to appreciate in Mura Masa playing it in its entirety live. While Bonzai’s intonation and style mirrored that of A$AP Rocky as she sang Love$ick, it was lacking in the personality of A$AP’s rap. “Move Me” too could have been layered with a little more of Octavian’s rapping.
While Mura Masa’s performance was not particularly groundbreaking or unconventional, often settling into the role of accompanist for Bonzai’s vivacious performance, he offered a likeable show featuring his most notable discography.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lord Huron resembled many an indie folk band as they mounted the stage at Boston Calling Friday evening. The band members sported styalized acoustic guitars, and lead singer Ben Schneider wore a suit with a blazer and a long bolo tie fastened under his collar. They never transcended that initial impression. A long soft guitar and vocal opening followed by a crescendo, added instrumentals, and sometimes a quickened tempo comprise the staple structure of Lord Huron’s music. While heartfelt and relaxing, their music is relatively homogeneous. They are an archetypal band of indie folk with few elements that distinguish them from big-name, stylistically original precedents like Mumford & Sons or The Lumineers, and the same went for their performance.
For noncommittal but appreciative fans of Lord Huron’s style of country-tinged indie-folk music, the concert was unenthralling after the first song. It also meant that everything besides the music was fair game for scrutiny, from their outfits to hair to the awkward lower-right-hand angles of Schneider on the large displays on either side of the stage. He donned a distracting hat that repeatedly fell off, when not intentionally thrown down while headbanging. His scrunched face as he got into the music contrasted with the drummer’s smile as he nodded to the beat. His entire persona seemed contrived, from his smooth “Thank you thank you thank you” after one song to his “How the hell are you doing out there, Boston?” to a hint of a Southern accent that evidently was not his, a Michigan native. Lord Huron raises the question of what it means to live your art. A successful artist does, while others come across as cheesy to the skeptic viewer. Lord Huron treads on the threshold.
The performance was enjoyable but somewhat chaotic — there were a number of men with guitars on stage, as well as someone who at times simply clapped a tambourine while cameras streamed her on the large screens. Lord Huron’s style aspires to a touching mellow through songs like “Wait By The River,” but they conflate mellowness with blandness. Its lyrics and title include iconography that may invoke nostalgia for some, but that is unexciting for those who cannot relate to waiting by rivers. Mellow music can be great for those in the right mood, but a concert, where the crowd’s attention is upon the artist, demands enhancing elements. Beyond the vocals, percussion, and guitar, there were few other noteworthy elements to the show. There was relatively little done with the lights besides a consistent flashing overhead, and the displays were only lit in vertical grids of dots. Schneider and other guitarists only danced or walked around a little during relatively high-energy moments or songs, like “Fool for Love.” There were a few stand-out, odd moments, in particular the time Schneider said before the band played “The Night We Met,” a track featured on the television show “13 Reasons Why,” that he wasn’t telling the audience how to live their lives, but “This one’s good for making out.” Few people in the audience made out.
Lord Huron’s cut-and-dry performance simply did little live that it could not do via an audio-streaming app. They could do more to uplift and accentuate a mellow, yet pretty set to captivate the fans, existing and potential, that come to their performances.

Many festival attendees did not buy their tickets to see Scottish synth-pop group CHVRCHES. This was less because Twenty One Pilots’ fan base dwarfs CHVRCHES and more because the band was enlisted as a last-minute replacement for Janelle Monáe, an act they conceded was twice as cool and more well-rounded than them. But coming back from two weeks of self-described laziness at home, CHVRCHES delivered a resoundingly clear and danceable set that rewarded those who chose to seek out the Blue Stage last night.
Lead singer Lauren Mayberry commanded the stage from the very start. Clad in a pink fluorescent dress, she spun and joked her way through the night, crafting a larger-than-life stage presence. Her ability to move the crowd brought into question the necessity of having the rest of the band on stage, especially since Martin Doherty and Iain Cook played synths for much of the set. Indeed, there likely exists a version of CHVRCHES in a parallel universe with just Mayberry on stage. What that version lacks, though, is the intensity and occasional banter Mayberry’s bandmates brought to the stage. Even as the spotlight remained firmly on Mayberry, the rest of the band provided a selfless energy to her performance. Cook performed a vigorous guitar solo largely in the dark during “Forever,” and tour drummer Jonny Scott stepped up on the apocalyptic and destructive cut “Science/Visions.” The rest of the band saved their largest impression for last, performing a dominant outro to set closer “Never Say Die” on their own after Mayberry left the stage. The other members also shone when Mayberry was on the stage, as they completed 2013’s “We Sink” with a dazzling display of lights and synths that complemented Mayberry’s dancing next to the drums.
Mayberry’s electrifying vocals and the band’s refusal to sink into the shadows contributed to a heartfelt and impressive set. CHVRCHES came out strong initially, opening with 2018 hit “Get Out,” which gave Mayberry a chance to demonstrate her range from the onset. The band played mostly from their new album “Love Is Dead.” Despite the title, and even as many of the songs wrestled with the themes of rejection and the decay of relationships, the vocals and synths evoked an uplifting mood. Even though CHVRCHES did not play their chart-ascending hit “Here With Me,” their hour-long set provided enough gems to keep the audience in a perpetual state of dance. The band was thankful for the crowd’s energy, professing their love for performing in the city and playfully addressing the irony of Mayberry, a Brit, drinking tea between tracks in Boston. Boston Tea Party jokes aside, CHVRCHES delivered an eminently enjoyable performance.
That said, Boston Calling failed CHVRCHES logistically. Besides the vocal mixing on the Blue Stage sounding off at the beginning of the show — as it did for every other Blue Stage performer that day — the band’s set time needlessly overlapped with Twenty One Pilots’. Even as CHVRCHES ceded the stage a few minutes early, fans who stuck the course arrived at the headliner almost half an hour late. To avoid this conflict, a decent chunk of the crowd chose to leave CHVRCHES near the tail end of the set, dampening the mood and taking something away from the spectacular climax of “The Mother We Share” and “Never Say Die.” This problem was not lost on Mayberry, who joked after “Clearest Blue” that she mistook Twenty One Pilots’ pyrotechnics for a forest fire in the distance and affirmed that, while her ponytail was more acoustic than pyrotechnic, they would still show the crowd a good time while they could. The organizers could have easily avoided this dilemma by having CHVRCHES start 15 minutes earlier with Greta Van Fleet — as is the plan for acts on Saturday and Sunday — eliminating the overlap with the headliner. Instead, for reasons unknown, they chose to stagger the performance times, ending CHVRCHES’ stellar set on a somewhat sour note. Still, CHVRCHES responded with their trademark intensity and captivated their remaining audience with a blistering rendition of “Never Say Die,” demonstrating their resilience in the face of unforeseen challenges.

Baltimore-based punk outfit Turnstile opened up the Green Stage with raucous energy, entertaining the large number of Twenty One Pilots fans camping out for front row seats at the headlining set. The intensity of the band initially surprised much of the crowd. As a result, some of Turnstile’s most successful tracks — “Generator” and “Real Thing” — lacked a true audience. But as the shock wore off, Turnstile did something unexpected. They redefined themselves, starting with the jazzy intermission music played when the band needed a break between harder songs. The songs in question were their own — one of which was ironically titled “Bomb” — and gave an aura of self-awareness that similar acts tend to lack. Turnstile also demonstrated their group cohesion by switching lead vocals off to bassist Franz Lyons mid-set. The New York Yankees hat-clad rocker brought a mellower demeanor to the stage on tracks like “Moon” and helped show off Turnstile’s surprisingly large range. This turn coincided with the crowd’s formation of a mosh pit near the stage. As Turnstile played an incredibly moving synth-based outro to one of their mellower, Lyons-led tracks, the craziness lifted for a moment as all in attendance fully took in the 180 degree turn they were witnessing. However, true to their roots, Turnstile closed with one of lead singer Brady Ebert’s older cuts titled “Gravity,” and the band ended their set with the same intensity that put off many casual onlookers earlier in the hour. This time, though, they performed for a self-selected group of fans fully along for the ride.
Facing a somewhat sparse afternoon crowd, Bear Hands took the opportunity to promote their new album, “Fake Tunes.” While songs from the two-week old album had their share of fun moments, they largely fell flat. Part of this was out of Bear Hands’ control: the sound mixing on the Delta Blue Stage seemed to be lacking for most of the day, drowning out each successive lead singer until Chvrches. During “Blue Lips,” lead singer Dylan Rau’s microphone cut out entirely during the second verse. Given that the verse was one of the few parts of the song actually sung on stage — featured artist Ursula Rose was “thousands of miles away,” according to Rau — any feeling of a climax dissipated even after Rau singing became audible again. That being said, Bear Hands left the crowd with a few memorable moments. Bassist Val Loper playfully left the stage and came back with maracas for their deep cut “What a Drag,” which Rau labeled “a special treat” for the Boston crowd. New song “Reptilians” was preceded by playful banter about John Harvard acting as big brother and a dedication of the song to the lizard overlords running the world behind the scenes. In the set closer “Giants,” Rau danced around the stage, eventually falling in an exaggerated manner before finishing the final verse partly on his back.
While Bear Hands played at the Delta Blue Stage, the Manchester indie-pop band Pale Waves put on a high energy show on the festival’s Red Stage. Not even the cloudy weather could keep people from dancing when the group opened with “Eighteen,” a song from their 2018 album “My Mind Makes Noises.” Lead singer Heather Baron-Gracie’s clear vocals layered over strong guitar and a oscillating beat made it impossible not to bop along to the catchy tune. The band used their afternoon set to showcase several songs from “My Mind Makes Noises,” most notably “Kiss” and “One More Time,” while seamlessly incorporating “The Tide” from their earlier EP “All the Things I Never Said.” Not even the band could keep from nodding and dancing to their own tracks — Baron-Gracie scooted about the stage while singing, subtly waving her fingers (the middle ones in particular) when not playing the guitar. “This song’s a bit dramatic, but all good things are dramatic,” Baron-Gracie said before jumping into their final song, “One More Time,” and she and the crowd danced together one last time before Pale Waves left the stage.
One of the highlights of the day was the Australian indie group Gang of Youths. Taking the Blue Stage in the late afternoon, the rockers capitalized on a mood often overlooked in the alternative scene: optimism. While their seven-song set asked tough questions, the resounding answers created a surprising mood of exuberance and playfulness lead vocalist David Le’aupepe — the stylistic midpoint between Jon Snow and Khal Drogo — professed his faith in people throughout the concert. He dedicated “The Heart Is a Muscle” to the memory of his deceased father, who taught him to “love well, love hard, and love long.” During the band’s 2015 cut “Magnolia,” Le’aupepe jumped into the crowd, hugging and dancing with as many festgoers as possible on a profoundly individual basis. He also demonstrated his chops as a showman by endlessly complimenting Boston for, in no particular order, Frasier Crane, Ted Williams, Brookline, and the best years of Chris Sale. The peak of the set was the 2017 hit “Let Me Down Easy,” preceded by a benediction from Le’aupepe in which he asserted that there is no problem in life that cannot be solved by dancing for five uninterrupted minutes. For those five minutes, and throughout the entirety of Gang of Youths’ time at Boston Calling, existential dread was tinged with an unavoidable sense of happiness.

Absent of all fanfare and theatrics, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun are two fairly unassuming young men. This fact is not lost on the duo from Columbus, Ohio. “Listen. I know, some of you may be thinking, why are they headlining,” said Joseph, introducing himself to the audience. “We don’t necessarily deserve to headline your amazing festival in your amazing city. But, if you give us the time, we would like to earn it tonight.” And yet, despite these humble words, fans gathered hours in advance to get the best possible seats for the duo’s headlining set. Identifiable by their yellow and camouflage apparel — inspired by the group’s most recent album “Trench” — diehard fans camped out at the festival’s Green Stage from the moment gates opened at 2:30 p.m. until the stage lights finally dimmed, signaling the start of Twenty One Pilots’ 9:50 p.m. set. Dun entered carrying a flaming torch, illuminating his white mask and dystopian, yellow-taped hoodie. For the next hour and 40 minutes, Dun and Joseph proved themselves to be more than deserving of their headlining slot — marrying concept, deft musicianship, and high-energy antics in a powerhouse performance.
The translation of a concept album to the stage is no easy feat, especially when the time allotted extends far beyond that which is required to explore a single album. Instead of adhering strictly to a specific theme or order, Twenty One Pilots’ setlist weaved back and forth between their five studio albums to date, shifting the tone as called for by the individual songs rather than their particular era. For the opening number “Jumpsuit,” a lead single off of “Trench,” the two wore masks, playing bass (Joseph) and drums (Dun) while an onstage car lit up in flames behind them. For the bridge, Joseph turned to the piano and to his higher register to croon “I’ll be right there / But you have to grab my throat and lift me in the air” bathed in blood-orange light. The pair kept up their futuristic style for the rap-rock track “Levitate” before dialing their scale back again for the piano introduction to “Heathens.” Few headlining acts at Boston Calling center their show around a keyboard, let alone an upright piano, but anticipatory screams accompanied each of Joseph’s many moves toward the keys. Every line of the hit song was joined by a chorus of voices from the crowd.
For skeptics, it’s easy to see how the spectacle could be daunting. When Tyler Joseph commands his audience it’s hard not to liken it to proselytizing, not an unfound observation from a group whose Evangelical roots strongly influence their approach to music. While Twenty One Pilots often question and provoke Christian proselytization in their music (ex. “All my friends are heathens take it slow / Wait for them to ask you who you know / Please don’t make any sudden moves / You don’t know the half of the abuse”), onstage they commanded trust and camaraderie. Audience participation was not just encouraged, but mandatory. Whether given instructions from Joseph to wrap arms around one another and step to the left and right, kneel to the ground, or to climb on each other’s shoulders, the crowd rushed to obey. Joseph kept up this call-and-response routine, culminating in his climbing atop the hands of screaming fans to serenade them from within the crowd.
Setting aside the flaming car and sentient, wandering beanie featured at several points throughout the performance, Twenty One Pilots’ ultimate draw — for fans and skeptics alike — is their relatability. Their music is deeply rooted in the Ohio punk rock scene, the wail of Joseph’s voice being one of many testaments to that fact, but there’s something else about the duo that sticks. Even with just two people onstage — and often no one playing guitar — the performance still felt massive. While Joseph’s foray into rap may feel a bit disingenuous at first listen, it’s inarguable that he has a strong sense of rhythm and a knack for catchy, resonant lyrics. There’s an angst in lines like “‘Wake up you need to make money!’” from “Stressed Out” and “Sometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it / My pride is no longer inside / It’s on my sleeve, my skin will scream” from “Car Radio” that is genuine, and to sing along is catharsis.
At the end of the set, Dun and Joseph rose above the crowd one last time — smashing drums to on platforms held up by members of the audience, cueing the explosion of confetti cannons into the yellow lights accompanying the song “Trees.” Twenty One Pilots ended the night united with their fans, cut-up yellow paper raining down on them as they sang together one last time.

While perhaps not the most obvious choice for a music festival lineup, company members from Boston Ballet put on a dreamy performance on the festival’s Green Stage. One of three total company performances scattered throughout the festival, Saturday’s piece, choreographed by company member Sage Humphries, zeroed in on rock and roll. Accompanied by electric guitar and vocals from Humphries’s brother Michael (stage name FutureSelf) four dancers strode on stage clad in all black and donning trench coats. They then proceeded to dance, in pairs and apart to FutureSelf’s renditions of songs from The Beatles’ “The Beatles” (better known as “The White Album”). The tribute endeared and delighted early arrivals to the fest — the cheering that accompanied particularly striking choreography and lifts made for a fun departure from typical ballet etiquette. Following the rock tribute, two new dancers took the stage to perform a Yury Yanowski choreographed duet to the song “Final” by Wilsen, accompanied by the band’s lead singer Tamsin Wilson. The pair weaved in and out of the negative space between them, deftly telling a story of love, tension, and grief through their movement to the melancholic tune. The short but sweet performance was the perfect kick-off for the relaxed Saturday afternoon crowd.
After Boston Ballet wrapped up their performance on the Green Stage, current Northeastern University student and Boston-based musician Sidney Gish took to the Red Stage to give one of the fest’s most entertaining early sets. Gish opened with her song “Mouth Log,” an excellent introduction to her witty songwriting. “And groups for memes, where everyone fights / And tries to make straight white boys cry,” she sang, provoking simultaneous laughing, cheering, and dancing along. The simplicity of her set — Gish performs alone with a loop pedal — made the quality even more impressive, needing only her guitar skills and voice to impress. This is of little surprise for those previously familiar with Gish’s work which, gauging from the shouted song requests and chanting along of many an audience member, were in abundance on Saturday. While the singer-songwriter still has one semester left before she graduates college, she finished off last summer opening for the musician and fellow Saturday performer Mitski on the New England leg of her Be The Cowboy Tour. Despite this exposure, Gish still seemed stunned and elated at the size and energy of her Boston Calling crowd — she couldn’t keep from breaking into a smile for the vast majority of the set and an occasional wince or eyebrow raise giving away her surprise at hitting the right notes. She played an impressive number of songs from her albums and EPs including “Imposter Syndrome,” “Sin Triangle,” and “Presumably Dead Arm,” but merited a longer set than half an hour. If her talent and industry-savvy is any indication she will, without a doubt, be back.
Lo-fi artist Clairo played a mellow set on the Green Stage for hundreds of colorfully dressed and high energy attendees in the warm afternoon sun. The up-and-coming artist’s relaxed beats and airy voice floated out from the stage, inviting dancing but not forcing it. She treaded the lines between apathy, coolness, and sincerity in her performance, swaying and brushing back her hair along to the infectious hooks of songs “Get with U” and “Flaming Hot Cheetos,” the latter of which has almost 51,000,000 plays on Spotify. Clairo played a mix of singles and tracks from her EP “diary 001” before launching in to a live performance of her new single “Bags,” released just a day before her festival performance. From her upcoming album, “Bags” trades in the bedroom-pop feel of her earlier music for more elaborate production and songwriting — the repeated hook “Walking out the door with your bags” floating over melodic synths and a particularly captivating snare beat. Issues with the sound mixing made it difficult to hear the singer’s slight voice over her band, but she persisted and ultimately impressed despite the hiccup. Clairo played two more unreleased songs before closing with “Pretty Girl,” the song whose accompanying video on YouTube propelled her to fame, and “4EVER.” The relaxed but dance-friendly set making an excellent lead in to the evening’s more high energy acts.
“What’s good!” said King Princess, rushing to the front of Boston Calling’s Delta Blue Stage for her Saturday set. “There’s a lotta gay youth here tonight,” she said, prompting shrieks of pride and agreement from the jumping, anticipatory crowd below her. Wasting no time, the 20-year-old musician dove into “Talia,” a single from her 2018 EP “Make My Bed,” repeating the catchy chorus an extra two or three times to lengthen the track. Her live band added an edgier feel to the mellow pop tune, capitalizing on its heavy base line and interjecting with extended bass and guitar solos to excellent effect. Her banter was sparse but amusing, a product of her laid-back, no worries persona and open-book mentality to speaking, performing, and posting on social media. While her attitude gives the initial impression of apathy, her performance revealed how deeply she cares about her music and its significance to the “gay youth” swaying and singing along with her. Like many of the fest’s newer acts, King Princess played unreleased songs from her upcoming album to fill out her 50-minute set. Unlike many of the fest’s greener acts, she was not lacking in name recognition or in fanfare. “I’m gonna give you the big pussy song,” she said, before launching into her anthemic single “Pussy Is God.” By the intoxicating song’s conclusion, the bras of overzealous fans littered the stage — the trademark of rock mythology taking the young artist by surprise. King Princess picked up her guitar and closed out the set with her smash hit “1950,” the crowd singing along faithfully to every word before she left the stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mitski is not for everybody, but she should be. The prolific indie-rocker took the Green Stage at Boston Calling Saturday afternoon to give one of the most unique performances of the weekend. Meticulously choreographed and experimental, Mitski’s live performances are experiential, closer to theatrical productions than they are to standard concert sets. Each movement of her arms, legs, torso — even her eyebrows — is tailored to the performance, constructing an elaborate fourth wall between performer and spectator. At Boston Calling, Mitski broke this fourth wall just a few times, letting the beauty of her music and performance art speak for itself.
Mitski strode on stage to the sound of fanatic screaming from a crowd decidedly younger than the previous day’s, lunging into an active rendition of “Goodbye, My Danish Sweetheart.” Taking a half-skip, half-step forward with each beat of the song, she paced back and forth across the stage — her simple clothes, black knee pads, and jazz shoes a testament to the physical endurance her set demands. On a plain white chair and table set center stage, Mitski laid to perform “Why Didn’t You Stop Me?” She thrust her legs into the air, circling them around one another in vertical bicycle wheels in time with the song’s whining synths. Only after a soft performance of “Old Friend” did she pause to introduce herself. “It’s so good to be here. I don’t know you, but I’m so full of love for you. Thank you for being here,” she said, perched on the table. “I just wanted to break the fourth wall a little bit to say hi, but now I’m going back.” She then proceeded to stretch her legs out into a half side plank, holding her body rigid as she sang with aching precision over the throbbing baseline of “Francis Forever.”
Considering the close attention paid to her movement, one might be led to wonder if Mitski can control each individual vocal cord as well. Whether side-planking, strutting, writhing, or jumping up and down, her voice remained consistent — floating effortlessly between her belt and head voices. At one point during the song “I Will” she rolled onto the table and sang upside down, her head rolled over the table’s edge and eyes trained toward the audience, but without making eye contact. The subtleties of her expressions were difficult to catch from a distance, but could be seen projected upon the stage’s video displays. Emotions of desire, sadness, anger, and panic flit across her face in time with the music. A look of fierce determination accompanied her flexing of her bicep during “I Don’t Smoke,” coinciding with the lines “You can lean on my arm / As you break my heart” to heart-wrenching effect. She performed a slowed-down version of already mellow “First Love/Late Spring,” giving the melodic tune a more anxious tone by pacing, panicked across the stage while reciting the lines “One word from you and I would / Jump off of this ledge I’m on, baby / Tell me ‘don’t,’ so I can crawl back in.” She projected fear and desperation rather than longing, emphasized by the careful movement of her body and strain of her voice.
The level of control that Mitski exercised over every single component of her performance — from the choreography to the music and the vibrant, pulsing projections behind her — made it all the more striking when she began to let loose. In a bout of constructed frustration during “Geyser,” she pushed up the table that had supported her the entire show thus far and began furiously trying to push it over, ultimately failing and collapsing to the floor. When the opening chords to “Townie” rang out, her carefully coordinated and repetitive arm movements and shakes of the head went out the window, replaced by headbanging, jumping, and shaking across the stage. The ode to reckless empowerment is best wailed, which Mitski did to perfection. “And I’ve tried sharing and I’ve tried caring / And I’ve tried putting out / But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on / For more, more, more,” she howled, crescendoing more and more on each repeated word. Screams rang out from the crowd when she punctuated the final line of the song — ”I wanna be what my body wants me to be” — by slapping her own ass.
It is impossible to describe each and every song that Mitski performed, and yet each is so expertly staged that they all merit attention. It is hard to put into words the intricacy and intimacy she achieved even in the distant atmosphere of a festival stage. After singing “Nobody,” Mitski welcomed those seeking to see other festival acts to leave. “I’ve played the hit,” she said, apologizing to those previously unfamiliar with her music. “This is the vibe, this is it.” This is true, but her performance is far more than a “vibe.” It is elaborate, meticulous, evocative, and expertly conducted. There are no weak Mitski songs, and certainly no weak performances. Her set is not the product of choreography, vocals, props, or visual effects, nor of a singular guitar or a synthesizer, it is their seamless combination. It is her, fully, and it is beautiful.

Anderson .Paak and the Free Nationals burst onto Boston Calling’s Green Stage Saturday night. First, men and women in cerulean bodysuits populated the stage: The Free Nationals. Next, Anderson .Paak emerged out of nowhere, playing a drum set painted with grinning lips reminiscent of the Rolling Stone logo on top of an on-stage podium. He wore an eccentric, summery outfit: a matching shirt and pants with separate patterns on the right and left halves, and a neon green bucket hat, topped off with a radiant smile, and — tints. Bringing variety in tone, energy, graphics, and lights, Anderson .Paak and the Free Nationals ran the gamut of performance possibilities — if they couldn’t win the crowd over with one call, they did with the next. The artists put on as literally and proverbially vibrant a show as the festival had seen thus far.
Opening with “Heart Don’t Stand a Chance,” Anderson .Paak faithfully delivered the 2016 hit from his second album “Malibu” that reeled in the crowd. Large flames leapt into the air with the opening. Two background singers from The Free Nationals to his right spun in circles and bumped hips. He then began yelling “Yes Lawd!,” in response to his tremendous audience, whom he asked to throw up one hand in the air. His signature line naturally transitioned into “Saviers Road” from his acclaimed 2018 album “Oxnard,” while the audience’s hands moved up and down with his. .Paak’s simultaneous vocals and drumming, moonwalk-like side-sliding across the stage, and other dancing dazzled the overflowing audience, who he bantered with throughout the show. From the first moments of his performance, Anderson .Paak illustrated a powerful ability to perform.
He hit upon songs like “Make It Better,” sans background graphics, from his album “Ventura,” out only over one month ago, and “6 Summers” from “Oxnard” while returning to older songs like “Come Down” from “Malibu.” He catered to more recent listeners, but his lineup was effective and nonetheless diverse, a virtue of the variety within his latest two albums. While most of the crowd was purportedly there for .Paak, he gave many a shout-out to the Free Nationals, whose impeccable live instrumentals greatly enhanced the performance, and whose trumpetist took the limelight at certain moments, in particular during the closing of “King James.” An appearance of Lil Nas X clad in cowboy-style clothing was unexpected but welcome, as anyone would give to see him play “Old Town Road.”
Images on the background displays were often vaguely psychedelic, with rapidly changing colors and abstract graphics that borrowed from funk music styles, while at other times the displays were like an old-fashioned video game or flashed block colors. The patterns did, at times, sometimes seem excessive alongside the extravagance of other stage elements, like shooting sparks and trails of flame. A massive image of the same circular, glittering tints .Paak wore accompanied the high-energy track “Tints” well. With “King James,” a newer and perhaps lesser known song that is a salute to Lebron James and Colin Kaepernick, .Paak took advantage of the screens to print lyrics while displaying the track’s intriguing cover art: a dollar bill with a childishly drawn rainbow behind a field of flowers in lieu of George Washington’s face, and Anderson .Paak’s name scrawled underneath in a handwriting similar to Basquiat’s.
Anderson .Paak ended on a wistful note with “Dang!,” a track from the late Mac Miller’s album “The Divine Feminine” as he sang and played percussion before a less experimental, still-flashy display of horizontal blue and black stripes. His percussion added to the performance in the large swaths of song in which Anderson .Paak did not sing. The performance closed with a massive projection of Anderson .Paak and Mac Miller smiling alongside one another in a sweet tribute.
Through a mélange of the most up-and-coming of his own music, Anderson .Paak’s show at Boston Calling displayed a level of performative genius that served longtime fans and complete strangers. He merits a reputation as a show-stealing live musician, an effect compounded by the dynamic and charismatic Free Nationals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every girl loves a bad boy, and so too, apparently, does Hollywood. Recent months have seen an uptick in true crime films and series, from “My Friend Dahmer,” starring Ross Lynch, to the latest “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,” directed by Joe Berlinger. Meanwhile, fictional shows in the crime genre have sexed up their serial killer protagonists, from Penn Badgley in “You” to Freddie Highmore in “Bates Motel,” though perhaps a slightly different grain of material. Hollywood execs have clearly taken stock of the growing fascination for lurid tales of real-life killers and their gruesome stories of being brought to justice — and they’ve responded in turn by feeding the appetite, with a veritable onslaught of new entries into genre.
There’s a real conversation to be had about the act of representing true crime on screen, particularly its traumatic consequences for the victims’ families who have to relive loved ones’ deaths, as Carolyn Murnick points out in her personal essay for The Cut. Consider, too, the consequences for people like Bundy’s longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kloepfer, whose name has been newly reintroduced into the public spotlight. But aside from those valid issues, watching “Extremely Wicked” raised another, less-discussed matter.
What’s most criminal about “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” is not its missing Oxford comma, but instead the casting of its lead actor, Zac Efron, of “High School Musical” fame. Because even when “Extremely Wicked” is criticizing Bundy’s awfulness, it’s also inadvertently touting his charisma. Maybe casting broad-shouldered, blue-eyed Efron was a sly, ironic wink at his history of playing the romantic lead, but the film’s irony is understated to the point of being nonexistent. Bundy is a serial killer, but Efron is used to batting his eyes and offering half-baked truisms with the ebullience and conviction of a modern-day Darcy. “I’m more popular than Disney World,” Efron’s Bundy proclaims in the film.
It’s true that charisma was one of Bundy’s great skills (it’s also one of Efron’s). But for Bundy, it was more than a skill — it was a deadly weapon of psychological manipulation. Bundy’s persistence is framed in the film as romantic, heroic perseverance for a woman of his affections, not the real emotional manipulation that misled women to their eventual deaths. His courtroom savvy only heightens his allure. “I guess I love him,” one teenage girl says, as if her admiration is beyond even her comprehension.
Real-life footage of Bundy shows a deranged killer with a manic glint in his eyes, and that may have been the intent for “Extremely Wicked.” But rarely is the veil lifted from our eyes — and when it is, it’s in the form of a brief coda, which does little to erase the two hours that Efron has spent dutifully charming the pants off the viewers. When the film elides the murders, it leaves them out of the record and de-legitimizes the very real violence against women that Bundy consciously perpetuated.
Naturally, the production team has excused away claims of romanticization by claiming they’ve focalized the film through Liz, played by Lily Collins. Yet what matters is not intent, but effect — and in practice, this narration does little to counteract the film’s willingness to sympathize with Bundy and pity Liz. Berlinger shows Bundy impressing the courtroom with his pre-law smarts while Liz listlessly drinks at home or stares vacantly at her work phone. In upholding such conventional gender portrayals, the film demonstrates that the female perspective is capricious, easily susceptible to emotion, and in denial. “When I feel his love, I feel like I’m on top of the world,” Liz says helplessly. Even when the premise aligns us with the women, the execution says she’s unreliable and therefore can’t be trusted.
What does it mean for a film to represent serial killers as sympathetic, attractive young men? For a rising tide of young actors, like Ross Lynch and Zac Efron, it means a new, challenging role with its own set of crooked teeth. And perhaps studios feel more comfortable with such well-known leads, whose other, more palatable Disney Channel roles will counterbalance the on-screen depravity of a bloodthirsty killer.
But it also means that serial killers are haloed with a newfound glamour, even sex appeal. After all, attractiveness is so often misconstrued as trustworthiness. Imagine the lurid Halloween costumes, the ardent fanaticism of a new crop of Instagram fan accounts. Imagine the ensuing revision, even if accidental, of the story of an immoral man as merely misunderstood, good at heart. The consequences of misrepresentation on-screen are tangible and real. “This trial will be televised, so you can judge for yourself,” the prosecuting attorney (Jim Parsons) announces in the film. If only that were true.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will open a new center for academic support in August and close the Bureau of Study Counsel in December, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh announced in an email to students Monday.
The new office — dubbed the Academic Resource Center — will have a slightly different focus from the BSC, Claybaugh and Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Sindhumathi Revuluri said in an interview Friday. The center will primarily offer tutoring in group classes — rather than in individual sessions — and peer tutors will schedule sessions differently. BSC staff will not automatically transition to the ARC.
Much like the BSC, the new center will serve both College students and students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences — GSAS Dean Emma Dench also announced the change Monday.
The BSC’s Linden Street building will close, and the new office will be housed at an accessible facility at 1414 Massachusetts Ave. Revuluri said she does not know how the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which owns the Linden Street property, plans to use it in the future.
The move to close the BSC comes after several years of changes to its mission.
In 2015, then-Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced that the College, rather than Harvard University Health Services, would oversee the office. At the time, administrators said they were unhappy with the BSC’s “hybrid model,” where students sought both mental health and academic support under one roof.
The new center will also have a more academic focus, Revuluri said.
“It came about at a time when we did not have institutionalized or robust mental health services. And so things like the Bureau of Study Counsel took on a much more kind of advisory, mentorship, pastoral role, which actually meant that there was a lot less focus on academic issues,” she said.
Revuluri said she thinks moving towards an academic focus will help students with class-related mental health challenges.
“We believe and we've seen evidence of equipping students with concrete skills and strategies being a real key to lowering academic stress,” she said. “Which is not to say that there isn't a place for processing those experiences as well, but we defer to our professional colleagues and CAMHS for that kind of support.”
Claybaugh and Revuluri said the transition would bring a number of other benefits. Revuluri said the new office will better serve an increasing number of undergraduates with dyslexia, dysgraphia, and other learning differences.
She added that she hopes the new center will help level the academic playing field at the College, citing the different levels of academic experience freshmen possess when they move to Cambridge.
Academic inequality appears to persist at the College — a Crimson report recently found that the majority of early-round Phi Beta Kappa recipients hailed from private secondary schools and public schools located in the nation’s wealthiest areas.
Revuluri and Claybaugh said they met with College students from the Undergraduate Council and Honor Council when planning the change. They also met with some faculty, who may receive feedback on their teaching under the new system.
“If one student comes in and needs help in a class, that student needs a tutor, but if a lot of students are coming in from the same class, that faculty member maybe needs some advice,” Claybaugh said.
Some BSC programs will remain open during the transition, including English as a Second Language services and individual academic advising, according to the ARC’s newly launched website. The programs will then transition to the new office in December.
In addition to hiring new staff for the ARC, the College also plans to hire two new administrators — a director and associate director focused on peer tutoring. Revuluri said the College has not yet ironed out the number of new staff positions.
