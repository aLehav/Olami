After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MOSHI, Tanzania—We were just sitting down to watch “Inception” when the power went out. At first we couldn’t find the DVD: Who watched it last? A search commences. As it turns out, Liz (Boston) watched it last. “At least we weren’t halfway through,” Lucy (Manchester) says. Jaimy (Amsterdam) wants us to play a Dutch drinking game called Spiker Pooper. It involves attaching a pen to your waist, spinning around and trying to lower the pen into a beer bottle. Laurens (Australia, by way of South Africa) and Jaimy play, and Laurens wins.
Frankie (Newcastle) has brought two candles into the room, so we have two small huddles of light through which to strain to see each other. You can barely make out the bookcase in the back of the room, stuffed with falling-apart books, mostly in English. It’s deceptively valuable because books, especially fiction ones, are fiendishly hard to find and expensive in Tanzania. A picture of David Hasselhoff, made up of thousands of tinier pictures, hangs on the wall alongside abstract art by the hostel’s manager, Abby (Tanzania). Abby also paints stunningly realistic baobab trees, elephants, other wildlife. He told me it takes him an hour to paint the realistic pictures and four hours for the abstract ones.
Maayan (Israel) and April (Michigan) are looking through Lonely Planet: Tanzania. “Gal, please don’t have sex with me in Zanzibar,” Maayan comments. He reads, “Homosexuality is punishable by 14 years in prison.” He gives me my hand flashlight back. “Thank you. I am completely displeased.”
Brendan (New Zealand) wants Gal (Israel) to friend him on Facebook. Gal is lucky enough to have brought a laptop[1] and bought a wireless Internet card. He is surfing the Israeli news site Ynet, reading about a soldier that was taken by Hamas. “But you probably can’t read it, it’s in Hebrew,” he apologizes. Gal and Maayan are teaching me Hebrew. Ma Shalom?
With eight rooms, a porch, and two tents, the hostel is too small for 27 people with an average age of around 23. There’s no hiding here; you have to be friends with these people who are so different from you. And so you fight, you learn, and you have fun.
[1] Maayan would like it to be known that the laptop is his, and that Gal is lucky to be friends with him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON—One sublet offer for every 40 emails sent, or a 2.5 percent success rate. By the numbers, my housing search hasn’t been pretty.
It made sense that renters hold the upper hand in a city like D.C., where thousands of interns converge every summer and make affordable housing options scarce. But the D.C. housing game was complicated in a way I hadn’t anticipated: with so much demand, the renters were looking for more than trustworthiness or the ability to pay—they were looking for a winning personality.
Some renters called for “interviews.” One asked all “applicants” to submit paragraphs summarizing their interests and favorite TV shows so she could select a subletter that fit best with her roommates. I pondered what to write: would I sound loud if I said I like to listen to Muse? Would I impress with my knowledge of Japanese dramas, or should I emphasize my more relatable love of True Blood?
Thankfully, I didn’t get a chance to write those paragraphs. Unexpectedly, the dates worked out with another renter, and the apartment was in a neighborhood that looked gorgeous under Google Street View’s perpetually blue skies. After so much trial and error, I found my home for the summer, and I breathed a sigh of relief at having earned the right to bid farewell to Craigslist—until next year, at least.

NEW YORK—I’ve been a commuter since I started kindergarten—or so I thought. For years I traveled from the suburbs to school in New York City, cozily nestled in the back of my dad’s car. But now that power suits on an express bus to an internship surround me, the identity that I share with thousands of New Yorkers has taken on new legitimacy. In a few short weeks I’ve realized that the New York City commute, though stressful at first, is deceptively simple. Here’s what I have learned:
1. There is one person you need to please.
Always wish the ill-tempered ticket vendor a wonderful day, even if all you receive in return is a scowl and barely audible grunt. If you don’t do so, she might take an excruciatingly long time to count out your change, causing you to helplessly look on as your bus—and your hopes of being on time for work—slip away.
2. Choosing whom to sit next to is crucial—and hazardous. There are four types you want to avoid:
The reader
Only a seasoned commuting professional can avoid the guy who will unapologetically elbow you in the arm every time he switches sections of the newspaper. This passenger is often identified by his thick-rimmed glasses and, of course, daily newspaper.
The talker
Next the infamous loudtalker—the one who spends the ride bellowing sales figures into his BlackBerry: “No, no, no, I said fifty! We have six days left to reach quota. Let’s make it happen, all right team?” Watch as his equally annoyed neighbors pry their eyes from their Kindles to shoot him admonishing—though futile—warning glares.
The sleeper
If you’re unlucky you might find yourself in a tight place—trapped between a window seat and someone who dozes dangerously close to your shoulder. A New Yorker, I cringe at the thought of physical contact with a complete stranger. So I inch closer and closer to the window until I am plastered to the side of the bus, torso pivoted and practically clinging to the window.
People
 Hey, it’s New York. Sharing a commute may give you a sense of solidarity, but a seat to yourself gives you even more. If you are fortunate enough to get enough your own, kick up those vagabond shoes and give yourself a pat on the back. You deserve it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
IRBID, Jordan—I don’t mean to sound cynical, but the average Matthew McConaughey film has more character than Irbid at first glance. If you don’t know—and you shouldn’t—Irbid is the second largest city in Jordan. Tucked into the northwestern corner of the country, it’s a stone’s throw—sometimes literally—from Israel and Syria. Under “culture” for Irbid, my guidebook suggests in typically British understatement, “try to go to Amman or Damascus.”
I’m here to study Arabic for the summer on a “language immersion” program, a euphemism which here means “no English.” Fortunately, Irbid maintains a small town attitude despite its population of more than half a million, and finding conversation among locals is easy.
And you’ll find a lot of it at News Café, the hippest place in Irbid, which is sort of like being the hardest working Government concentrator. Walk in on a weekend night and you will see about fifty dudes, mostly college-age, all smoking hookah (called “argyla” here) or cigarettes while playing backgammon or cards. Typical topics of conversation are sports, weather, women, and—of course—politics.
Backgammon and hookah are to the Arab world what chess and vodka were to the Soviet Union. By the third game, you’re best friends with your opponent and by the seventh his once-cautious lips are sputtering anxieties and frustrations about an-nidhawm—“the system.” When conversation turns to the royal family or the military, words become whispers, mirthful looks turn to nervous glances, and cigarettes suddenly receive as much fidgety chewing as they do smoking.
I realized this when, with the big stupid grin of an American, I loudly joked to my Palestinian friend that Jordan had military conscription to create a national pride that, in reality, has little basis for existence. Scanning the room with the corner of his eyes, his facial expression was ashen as he mouthed “mukhabarat.” “Mukhabarat”—the secret police—is a word that has scared many people before it scared me, a naïve American in a coffee shop.
Jordan’s feared Mukhabarat is just one of many symptoms of Jordan’s perpetual insecurity as a nation-state. The overt arbitrariness of its borders, its lack of historical congruity, and the Palestinian roots of two thirds of its citizens each reveal that it isn’t the stable nation-state it pretends to be. Nonetheless, it acts like one, and with time the act has become convincing. The longer the theater goes on and the longer the people dutifully, fearfully clap, the more the people think they are clapping because they enjoy the theater. And, if you become tired of pretending to enjoy the show, play backgammon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an hour and a half of tense exchange Monday between Allston residents and Harvard representatives about the recent list of recommendations for the University’s plans for the Allston development, one outside observer interjected with a comment that brought the heated dialogue to a halt.
“This isn’t even about planning,” said former Boston City Councillor Bruce C. Bolling, who is neither an Allston resident nor a Harvard affiliate. “You have a fractured relationship.”
Addressing the disgruntled parties, he added, “You cannot go forward until you address this fractured relationship. Allston and Harvard have to go forward as one.”
A round of applause rang out at the meeting between the Harvard Allston Task Force and the Allston Work Team after Bolling’s remark.
About 60 people attended the meeting Monday night to discuss the recommendations for Allston that the Work Team announced almost two weeks ago.
The five-part plan includes developing the halted science complex into a life science center, creating an enterprise research campus, establishing housing for faculty and graduate students, planning for more academic space for the existing Charlesview site, and exploring the possibility of building a conference center and hotel.
Alex Krieger, one of the co-chairs of the Work Team and a Design School professor, illustrated the five recommendations by identifying each as a message to Harvard from the community.
Some of the messages included "Harvard, finish what you began" as the thinking behind the development of the science complex, and "Harvard, don't delay—start thinking very seriously about Barry's Corner" as part of the reason for planning to establish housing for faculty and graduate students there.
More than 10 members of the Task Force sat in a panel-like fashion at the front of the room, facing the handful of representatives from Harvard.
Several Allston residents took turns attacking the process that was used to arrive at the recommendations.
In response to the recommendation regarding expanding academic space—"Guess what, the future academic needs of Harvard will be handled in this triangle"—Brent Whelan ’73, a Task Force member who spoke several times during the meeting, said that they had been expecting museums and cultural space in that area.
Whelan said that the recommendation to "enable academic growth by preserving land adjacent to existing campus" was not specific enough and could mean decades of staring at an empty space before Harvard decided what to do with it.
“I’m pretty distressed that the planning is going on with a narrow focus,” Whelan said, asking the representatives from Harvard why the community was not consulted in making the recommendations. “If that’s what Harvard’s going to do, then just tell us, so we can stop coming to meetings.”
Task Force member Bruce E. Houghton called the Work Team representatives present at the meeting the “new kids on the block," alluding to the short amount of time that Co-Chairs Bill Purcell and Krieger and Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey had been involved in the Allston planning process compared to the Allston residents who have lived there for decades.
But Casey remained calm in responding to the concerns of the Allston residents. He said that the Work Team would find a method to have a conversation about the integration that the residents were seeking.
The feedback from the meeting would be relayed to an internal review group, Casey said.

Last week, a study that analyzed factors contributing to weight gain linked potatoes with pounds. According to the study, potatoes were associated with greater gains in weight than all other foods studied, even more than desserts and alcohol.
News that potatoes are associated with weight gain didn't surprise many of you. One reader wrote in the comments: "Crappy junk food makes you gain weight. Pretty sure this is well established."
But what say the spokespeople for the spuds?
"The United States Potato Board believes a study released in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine perpetuates unfortunate myths and misconceptions about the potato," the Potato Board, a marketing organization, said in a statement. "Singling out the potato as a cause of weight gain is misleading and contrary to existing research."
The Potato Board said that weight loss is still possible with potatoes on your plate.
"Fresh potatoes are frequently victims of guilt by association," Tim O'Connor, the CEO of the Potato Board, said. "If you order a fully-loaded baked potato, the calories you should be worried about are coming from the toppings, not the potato."
And in an opinion piece released by his office, Idaho Governor C. L. "Butch" Otter chastised the study, scolding those who raise "inflammatory allegations about a food as pure and natural as a potato."
Calling potatoes "a lifesaver of cultures from the Andes to Europe and even Asia," Otter echoed a charge made by the Potato Board, that the study did not take into account total caloric intake.
"As Governor of America's largest potato-producing state—a distinction of which we're justifiably proud—I'm disappointed that this study singled out potatoes, one of the most nutrient-dense and affordable vegetables available to people around the globe," he said.
