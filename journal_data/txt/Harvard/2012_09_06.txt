After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there’s one American political figure that the 2012 election makes one yearn for, it’s Teddy Roosevelt. Not for all of his policies, but for what he recognized and saw in the American political system; something that he quite frankly would not find today. Speaking at the Harvard Union (now the Barker Center) in 1907, Roosevelt stated, “In popular government results worth having can be achieved only by men who combine worthy ideals with practical good sense.” Today, the individuals Roosevelt was referring to would be dismissed as ideologues, not demagogues. The end of their campaigns is not to win powerful political positions but to advance their philosophy. They don’t follow polls; they lead with ideals.
The great men and women of history became great because they had the courage to stand for something larger than themselves. For many, that something was God; for others, liberty or human rights. They had a vision based on their understanding of human nature and the world, and they campaigned to advance it. The greatest tragedy in America today is that most of our leaders have lost their vision, and we as American citizens don’t have a great enough understanding to propose a new one. We declare wars upon poverty and inequality and then fail to acknowledge the inequality of results inherent to liberty or the limits of human nature. We scream about the war on women and “abortion rights” without discussing what rights are in the first place. These questions are not settled, but they have been addressed. The intellectual history of the liberal and conservative movements in America is rich but too often ignored.
If you want to be a leader in politics, you need to be motivated by more than a sound bite. The “worthy ideals” that Teddy Roosevelt saw within true leaders don’t fit within tweets; they find their homes in books. So study Friedman and Keynes. Consider Rawls and Locke. Ponder Chesterton, and, before you vehemently disagree with her, at least read Ayn Rand.
The philosophies of these thinkers are clashing in 2012 just like past elections. But unlike all other elections, 2012 is your first—and only—presidential election as a student of Harvard. Like other elections during your adult life, the parties have drawn similar battle lines that extend across issues, but during this one, you live in an academic environment with scholars who can teach you the intellectual history of political thought. Like other elections, this one is focused on the solutions to problems like broken education and immigration systems, but today you can meet professors (with office hours) who have advised presidents and determined major policy initiatives in these areas. Like other elections, campaigns will beg for your precious time, but only this time can you volunteer with a group of truly energetic classmates.
Yes, participating in an election is your civic duty, but it’s also a unique educational experience. Harvard has been a part of American history for nearly four centuries, but your part in American history begins today. Do more than just register to vote. Learn about philosophy and public policy with Harvard’s tremendous resources, and then share what you’ve learned with America on the campaign trail. Listen and learn; respond and repeat. The advertisements on TV and across social media may be ugly and negative, but you can make this election something else. Introduce philosophy, and you can make it inspiring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On August 17th, the staff of the University of Georgia’s independent student newspaper, The Red & Black, scored a victory for student newspapers across the country and for the integrity of modern-day journalism. Over the summer, the paper’s board tried to take editorial control over the daily out of the student’s hands and to give  nonstudent managers the power to review the paper’s content before it was published, and even veto the decisions taken by student editors. In response, these editors took part in a courageous walkout, publishing their content on other forums, until the proposed changes were rolled back.
Student journalism is a valuable forum for discussion on university policies and serves as a check on the institutional abuse of power, largely because of its perspective. Granting anyone other than a student editorial review power over student-produced content would be antithetical to the goals of student journalism and open up the possibility of corruption. Students offer a unique perspective on universities, who through their own publications seek to cast themselves in the most positive light possible.  Students, on the other hand, are best in position to experience the effects of the university’s policies and to comment candidly on them.
By challenging the status quo when the situation demands it, student journalists can have a real and positive impact over the world they are a part of. To provide just one recent example, this spring the Harvard Management Corporation announced it would not reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts, a company criticized for repeated allegations of labor rights abuses. The Crimson played a part in encouraging this decision through sustained coverage of these accusations as well as repeated calls to investigate the allegations.
As a matter of fact, by defending their journalistic integrity, student newspapers demonstrate their ability not only to be valuable members of the press community, but also their potential to be leaders in the field. This Tuesday, The Crimson announced a new policy severely restricting quote review, a practice which allows officials to edit their comments before they are put to press. It is this paper’s firm belief that quote review debases the basic principle of honesty on which journalism relies. Unfortunately, leading media organizations such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Reuters have all recently agreed to quote review, largely out of pressure from political campaigns. While we understand that such large media companies respond to different concerns than a student newspaper, we nevertheless would like to see more of the press taking the courageous stance, rather than the easy one, in this regard.
Despite the many struggles faced by journalism—whether high-profile lying scandals or widespread financial distress, to name just two—events at the University of Georgia have demonstrated that the industry has hope for a bright future. Congratulations to our peers at The Red & Black, and keep the old sheet flying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding the crest of a wave of bright-eyed interns, I washed up in Washington, D.C. and spent a portion of this past summer living there, in the national sandbox of politics. Like my fellow travelers, I set out working for the good guys and fighting the good fight. Washington, we quickly discovered, is a universe unique to itself, replete with its own character and life cycle.
To fully investigate the city’s character, I turned to the one medium that best represents Washington—blogs. They were the only means I had of experiencing the city without ever having to leave my room and actually experience the city. After some investigative research, I discovered that most D.C. blogs are about politics and politicians and political pundits, and those that aren’t deal with really stupid topics like losing your keys or taking a shower.
Washington, as I learned from the blogs, is an intensely political town. Those who have tired of losing keys and showering instead talk about the never-ending game of fighting for power. And boy, what a game it is. Entire industries center on preventing the other team from becoming more powerful and popular. “You’re killing Medicare!” “No, you’re killing Medicare!” “Well, I’m rubber, and you’re glue!” The whole process feels like a middle school game of dodgeball, with no set of rules but a dozen different referees.
But this all quickly faded away in early August, as the dodgeball game was outsourced from Washington to every other corner of the country. The recess bell rang, and the country’s leadership ran for the hills without looking back. The natural cycle of congressmen in Washington is oddly reminiscent of that of cicadas: They come out of hiding once every seventeen years or so to make a lot of noise before disappearing again for what seems like not nearly enough time.
The whole process is enough to make even the sanest observers question their sobriety. This, of course, is at least partly due to the mindboggling number of happy hours held everywhere from Capitol Hill to Foggy Bottom. America may run on Dunkin, but Washington staggers around on Heineken like it’s nobody’s business. Wonder no more about congressional inaction—when the workday doesn’t start until that headache goes away, not too much gets done. And when Harry Reid or Jon Stewart is busy mocking your boss on national television, that migraine tends to linger. To ease the pain, staffers head over to the next happy hour, which begins shortly after lunch.
This is summer vacation in Washington. The sun beats down on those of us lingering in the ghost town after the end of the gold rush. Senatorial offices are staffed by skeleton crews; the FBI closes altogether. (Who’s left to investigate, anyway?) Lincoln slips off his throne to take a nap and the tourists arrive in droves. As locals, of course, we make fun of these hapless visitors, who need directions to places we’ve finally found days earlier.
We lowly interns are largely left to our own devices, and spend vast quantities of time thinking about what to do with our vast quantities of time. After much deliberation, we do what the Lonely Planet recommends: visit the monuments and attend a Washington Walgreens baseball game, where we pretend to enjoy several hours of sweltering heat before of-age interns take refuge at a happy hour, where they run into a bipartisan assembly of upper-level congressional staffers holding a meeting. The staffers pretend not to see the interns, who manage to overhear part of the confidential conversation: “You’re killing Social Security!” “No, you’re killing Social Security!”
At long last, I was climbing out of the rabbit hole and headed home. I could finally clear out some much-needed space in my brain for non-political thoughts and focus on returning to school. But when I finally made it back to my house, I turned on the television set only to see election ad after election ad. I was left with no choice but to turn off the TV and fire up my laptop instead, and couldn’t help but check POLITICO.
After all, I loved my time in DC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge city Mayor, Henrietta Davis, has come out publicly endorsing New York’s ban on large sodas and proposed a similar ban in Cambridge. While many politicians throw around the terms “health crisis” or “obesity epidemic,” only a few brave souls like Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Davis have had the courage to treat it like the emergency it really is. It is high time some politicians put their money where their mouths are. Better yet—put your money where your mouths shouldn’t be.
The ban on soda in New York, likely to win over the board of health, will take effect in March. Violators will face a steep $200 fine, and many in the media have balked at such a high penalty. However, the media neglects the fact that large sodas may cost as much as 30 percent more than small sodas. Therefore, the fine will obviously fall on those with higher incomes. The bourgeoisie buyers of Big Gulps can surely afford the fine.
It takes courage to lobby for a bill that deprives people of their dietary freedom. Mayor Davis knows that democracy is not a popularity contest; it’s about being right and being right regardless of what the public thinks. As the old saying goes, the quickest way to an electorate’s heart is through its stomach. But this electorate has a surplus of stomach and obesity-related heart disease.
Many who have come out in opposition to the ban in Cambridge and New York have whined over the government’s intervention in the free market. However, the ban is certainly not unprecedented. Similar bans have been passed in New York before. In 1908, New York implemented a smoking ban. The only reason it was thrown out a couple years later was due to some legal minutiae; only women were arrested for smoking in public.
Moreover, even on the federal level, there has been applicable precedent. In 1919, a ban on beverages was so important it was ratified into the constitution of the United States. You can see the eighteenth amendment remains a part of our constitution to this day.
Governor Chris Christie, a representative of both the conservative and obese perspectives, decried the soda ban as “Daddy government.” It comes as no surprise that when Governor Christie weighs in, the result is shock and disappointment. If he had as many brains as he had chins, he would realize what an ad hoc and immature argument he is making. These criticisms of “Daddy government” and “paternalism” are particularly hypocritical considering how the governor, a self-proclaimed social conservative, constantly extols the importance of the father’s role in society. Christie laments the impact of absentee Dads but condemns the presence of “Daddy government.” Try as he might, Christie simply cannot have his cake and eat it too.
The proposed ban is more than accommodating. It is so generous as to extend an exemption to any drink with fewer than 25 calories per 8 ounces. However, counter-intuitively, this exemption is counterproductive. A recent study proves that people who drink diet sodas are more likely to have obesity-related health problems. Moreover, in a shocking discovery, rates of obesity among customers of the popular dietary shake, Slim Fast, were dramatically higher than those of the general populace. Backed by such empirical evidence, one can only hope that the Cambridge ban will include these unhealthy alternatives as well.
Mayor Bloomberg’s ban on large soda merely keeps his population from gaining more weight. It does not, however, affect weight loss. The law may stem the tide of rising obesity for the time being but it does not do anything to decrease the rate. However, there is a way this same bill could do just that: decrease the size of soda containers even further. If sodas were served in one ounce servings (instead of the 16 ounce maximum) then to consume the same 16 ounces of soda, the customer would have to get up to buy soda 16 times. Repeated purchases such as these would surely burn more calories and decrease the currently unacceptable levels of obesity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am writing in response to the article "Woman Allegedly Raped in Harvard Yard" posted on Aug. 10, 2012.
Specifically, I am writing to challenge the use of the word "allegedly" in the headline. While such language is appropriate when reporting on judicial proceedings to protect a presumption of innocence, it is inappropriate in this context.
Instead of protecting the presumed innocence of an accused party, the use of "allegedly" casts doubt on the truthfulness of the victim who survived a sexual assault on our campus Friday, August 10. One of the most common barriers to victims of sexual assault seeking further services is a fear that they will not be believed.
It is the firm belief of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response at Harvard University that no one ever deserves to be sexually assaulted. This tragic case highlights that sexual assault can happen in any community, to anyone, anytime.
Yet, there are many steps we can take to reduce sexual assault and create a safer environment for those who have survived it. One of these is to critically examine the language we use to discuss issues of sexual violence. The Crimson plays a crucial role in shaping campus discourse. Therefore, we encourage Crimson staff to promote the use of language which can build a safer, more supportive environment for survivors of sexual assault.
Christopher Gilbert is the Prevention Specialist at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.

Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren addressed the nation in a prime-time speech from the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, rallying her party behind President Barack Obama and reintroducing herself to a nation as the unlikely U.S. Senate hopeful who rose from the lower crust of the middle class to the protect American consumers in Washington.
Warren addressed the national political arena in the prominent slot introducing former President Bill Clinton. Her selection for the sought-after spot points to her intellectual prominence within the Democratic platform, much of which draws from work she has done on financial reform.
With a direct message, Warren strove to distance herself from the "beltway insiders" and career politicians who she said profited from an economic system that favors the wealthiest Americans.
"I am Elizabeth Warren, and this is my first Democratic Convention" she said, greeting an applauding arena.
Warren emphasized her middle-class upbringing and her struggles to climb the ladder that ultimately got her to Harvard. Throughout the speech, Warren frequently pointed to her background as an advocate for a consumer protection agency to aid the middle class against credit card and healthcare companies.
"I’m here tonight to talk about hard-working people. People who get up early, stay up late, cook dinner, and help out with homework. People…who work their hearts out but are up against a hard truth: the game is rigged against them," Warren said.
The latter half of her speech highlighted her ties to President Obama and her work building the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren, who faces a difficult race in Massachusetts, stood by the president’s tough stances toward Wall Street and defended him against Republican attacks.
She said that Democrats want to decrease national debt and build a stronger country from the middle class up, while former Mass. Governor Mitt Romney would give billions to big corporations and destroy both Medicare and Obama’s healthcare law.
Although she hammered the Republicans for being selfish and greedy, Warren barely mentioned her opponent in Massachusetts, Senator Scott Brown, who kept a low profile at the Republican National Convention last week—a sharp contrast to Warren’s prominent position in Charlotte. The two candidates have been running neck-and-neck for months.
Warren concluded her speech with a passage from the Christian Gospel of Matthew, calling Americans to action to strengthen the middle class and to look out for the least among them.
"The passage teaches about God in each of us, that we are bound to each other and called to act.  Not to sit, not to wait, but to act–all of us together," Warren said.
At Harvard, a crowd of roughly 120 students at the Institute of Politics whooped and cheered as Warren addressed consumer protection and college loans. After the speech, attendees praised the heartfelt tone of the speech, something they said seems rare in today’s politics.
"I thought it was perfect," Neil Alacha ’16 said. "You could really hear the emotion in her voice. You don’t often see that in politicians. They speak about issues, but you don’t really see the passion."

After a two-year federal investigation, the Office of Research Integrity found former Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser responsible for six counts of research misconduct, including fabrication of data, doctoring of results, and misrepresentation of research methods in his Harvard lab.
In a public statement, Hauser said that although he does not agree with the entirety of the report, he accepts full responsibility for errors made when he was head of the laboratory. He attributed many of those faults to his taking on too much responsibility at the University.
“I tried to do too much, teaching courses, running a large lab of students, sitting on several editorial boards, directing the Mind, Brain & Behavior Program at Harvard, conducting multiple research collaborations, and writing for the general public,” he wrote. “I let important details get away from my control, and as head of the lab, I take responsibility for all errors made within the lab, whether or not I was directly involved.”
The two-year inquiry came to an end today when the Department of Health and Human Services posted its official notice online. According to the report, Hauser’s research misconduct affected work—both published and unpublished—funded by four different national agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health.
Hauser, whose research primarily concerned animal cognition and moral psychology, maintains that much of the doubt surrounding his research is unmerited.
“I am saddened that this investigation has caused some to question all of my work, rather than the few papers and unpublished studies in question,” he wrote. “Before, during and after the investigation, many of my lab’s research findings were replicated by independent researchers. I remain proud of the many important papers generated by myself, my collaborators and my students over the years.”
Harvard conducted an internal review of Hauser’s work that preceded the national investigation by three years. After the Boston Globe announced that Hauser was taking a one-year leave of absence due to an investigation into the integrity of his work, Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith confirmed in Aug. 2010 that a Harvard committee had found Hauser “solely responsible” for eight instances of misconduct.
Since Harvard’s investigation, Hauser retracted or corrected three of the published articles found to be problematic. In more than one case, he and his associates also replicated findings and published their work again.
The new ORI report acknowledged these changes but still found the original papers faulty.
“As Dean Smith said two years ago, no university or college wants to see a member of the faculty found responsible for research misconduct, for such misconduct strikes at the core of our academic values,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement.
Bert Vaux, a former associate professor of linguistics at Harvard who in 2010 criticized the handling of the case, wrote to The Crimson that although he finds the report “clear and in certain ways reasonable,” he finds the amount of money invested in investigating Hauser’s case by Harvard and the government unwarranted, given that “the identified problems were all either retracted or never submitted.” Vaux communicated via email because he was traveling without access to a cell phone.
Hauser resigned from his tenured position on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in July 2011 after colleagues on the faculty voted to bar him from his teaching duties. In his statement on Wednesday, he called the investigation “long and painful” and added that he is “relieved” it is finally complete.
Since leaving Harvard, he wrote, he has turned his attention to working with at-risk youth.
Although Hauser “neither admits nor denies committing research misconduct,” according to the ORI report, he has agreed to supervision for any new government-sponsored research he conducts, review and public disclosure to funding agencies of the legitimacy of his data by institutions that employ him in the future, and exclusion from advisory responsibilities to the U.S. Public Health Service.

Cambridge residents voting in Thursday’s primary will determine the next state representative from the 25th Middlesex District, the only Congressional district wholly contained within the Democratic stronghold of Cambridge. The winner among the three Democrats competing in the primary will run unopposed in the general election since there is no challenger from the Republican party.
Voters said they expect that Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker will win the primary and with it the seat.
Local pundit Robert Winters went so far as to estimate her chances of winning the election at “101 percent.”
Decker’s opponents are Gayle E. Johnson, an active volunteer in Cambridge, and Lesley R. Phillips, the chair of the Ward 6 Democratic Committee in the city who holds a master’s degree from Harvard Divinity School.
The seat is currently held by Alice K. Wolf, who announced that she would not be running for reelection last March. Decker, who declared her intention to run hours afterwards, worked for Wolf as a legislative aide and later as her campaign manager. She has received public support from Wolf and many of her fellow city councillors in her congressional bid.
“She’s very passionate, she’s very smart, she’s got great progressive values, and I think she would do a great job in this seat,” Wolf said. “I hope she wins the race.”
Glenn S. Koocher ’71, a former member of the Cambridge School Committee, said that Decker has the most visibility among the three contenders.
“She’s well known, outspoken, and aggressive for making her feelings known. She has the advantage for being out there,” Koocher said.
Michael Kenney, a retired Boston Globe reporter and a resident of Cambridge, remembered that at the beginning of the Iraq War, Decker made a practice of reading the names of American soldiers killed in Iraq during City Council meetings.
“She would not only ask for a moment of silence, but for permission to read the names of the soldiers killed in action. She’s always been very strong on the veterans, always been very strong on the unions,” he said.
Her opponent Phillips serves on the board of Citizens for Participation in Political Action and is also a member of the city’s Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Commission. She has campaigned on issues including single-payer health care, affordable housing, and environmental sustainability.
Kenney recognized Phillips as “certainly the serious challenger,” and noted that Johnson “has not made much of a presence.”
Phillips said, “I see myself as an independent voice to get some things done in the district and the Commonwealth. I’m not interested in my future positions.”
Johnson, who is blind, serves as the chair of the Cambridge Commission for Persons with Disabilities and volunteers for a crisis intervention hotline. She also works as a community organizer for the Massachusetts Alliance of African People and previously worked on Beacon Hill as an aide in the House and the Senate.
Decker and Johnson did not return requests for interviews.

A two-year-old reform to Harvard’s disciplinary body will give the board members more options when they decide how to penalize any students found guilty of academic dishonesty in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
The Administrative Board is currently investigating about 125 students—nearly two percent of the student body—for allegedly plagiarizing answers or inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in assistant professor Matthew B. Platt’s spring government course.
Before the reform, students found guilty of academic misconduct by the Ad Board would have faced three possible punishments: a warning, a probationary period, or a requirement to withdraw from the College, typically for two to four semesters.
But due to a change approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in May 2010, the Ad Board has two additional, arguably less severe, ways to punish students which it may use for anyone found guilty of illicit collaboration in Government 1310.
In cooperation with the board and the chairs of their department, professors now have the power to dole out “local sanctions” to students guilty of academic dishonesty, including required tutoring, a mandatory re-do of the assignment in question, or a grade penalty.
The Ad Board also now has the power to “exclude” guilty students from Government 1310, a transcript notation equivalent to failing the course.Matthew L. Sundquist ’09—a former Undergraduate Council president and member of the Committee to Review the Administrative Board, which recommended those and other changes to the Board in a 2009 report—said his committee’s recommendations were intended to fix a one-size-fits-all approach to punishing cheaters.
“[The committee] wanted to have more nuanced abilities to use meaningful outcomes in the educational process,” Sundquist said. “People should be given a second chance—we thought that was the most educational way of doing it.”
In the 2010-2011 school year, the first year after the changes went into effect, disciplinary cases spiked by 150 percent. Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison attributed the increase to the reform, saying that those who notice academic dishonesty may be more likely to turn students in since they know they are not necessarily dooming them to required withdrawal.
Sociology professor Bruce Western said that though he has not recently dealt with any academic integrity violations in his own courses, he is happy to have the option of issuing local penalties if he encounters cheating in the future.
“As a matter of principle, I think it’s probably good to have the flexibility, because I think the facts of these case can often be quite complicated,” Western said. “So I think we have to be able to deal with them in a variety of different ways.”
But professors interviewed for this article said they did not necessarily expect Harvard to issue penalties lighter than required withdrawal in such a large cheating investigation.
Robert H. Bates, a professor of government and of African and African American studies, predicted that the school would choose strict punishments for students found guilty in this case.
“This cuts to the core of integrity,” Bates said. “It will be very costly to the institution and to the students, but the costs of not appropriately re-educating ourselves...would be even greater, enormously greater. This gets down to who we are, as academics and as students and as an institution of high culture.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who focuses on higher education law, also said he expects Harvard to react harshly.Lake said he thinks Harvard is unusually positioned to be able to survive the financial blow of issuing what he predicted could be dozens of verdicts requiring guilty students to withdraw from the College for a year. In such a scenario, Harvard would lose what could be millions of dollars in tuition all at once. But unlike other schools, Lake suggested, Harvard could afford this loss.
“Of all the schools out there, Harvard certainly has the resources to weather that kind of storm,” Lake said.
Lake said Harvard administrators may also reason that if they let guilty students off lightly, Harvard’s reputation as a peerlessly rigorous leader in academia could be jeopardized.
For schools like Harvard, Lake said, “it’s worth it to take a hit to preserve your brand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School accepted 25 applicants to its 2+2 Program during the first of its four admissions cycles this year. Seven of the students accepted to the program, which selects college seniors who work for two years and then matriculate at the Business School, are Harvard College students.
Deirdre C. Leopold, managing director of MBA admissions and financial aid, declined to specify the total number of applicants or whether any students were deferred for further consideration in the three remaining rounds of the application process this year.
Economics concentrator Ali E. Evans ’13 received his acceptance email on Wednesday while sitting in class next to his roommates. He said he celebrated silently and texted his parents.
Evans said he has visited classes at the Business School with his tutors at Kirkland House since sophomore year.
“Leading my own company one day is definitely a goal of mine, and so business school definitely fits in with that plan,” he said.
The 2+2 Program, which accepted its first applicants in 2008, lets students apply in their senior year of college. Admitted students are asked to spend two years in the workforce before arriving at the Business School, but some choose to work for additional years.
“2+2 gives you this sense of security to go out and do whatever you want without the fear of failure,” said Tom Dan ’13, another admitted student. He said he plans to pursue work in the media industry before he returns to Harvard.
These are the first decisions released since HBS announced a change to its application in May which cut down the number of required essays from four to two. Students are now asked to submit an additional post-interview reflection.
Dan said he found the new application to be “amazingly straightforward.”Harvard College has been well represented in the first three admitted classes to the 2+2 program. Twenty-two out of 106 students in the 2+2 Class of 2013, 27 out of 115 in the Class of 2014, and about 20 of 100 in the Class of 2015 were Harvard undergraduates.
The students accepted in this round submitted their 2+2 applications by July 10, according to the admissions website. The three remaining application rounds, which are open to both 2+2 and regular MBA applicants, have deadlines on September 24, January 7, and April 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With shopping week underway on campus, a group of Harvard College Democrats elected to forgo introductory government lectures for a firsthand lesson in national politics.
Instead of settling into the fall semester, the Harvard affiliates—including students, faculty, and staffers at the Institute of Politics—will be on hand in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday night to watch one of their own, President Barack Obama, Harvard Law School Class of 1991, accept his party’s nomination for president on the final night of the Democratic National Convention.
Almost a dozen students who have been following the DNC’s work in Charlotte are attending their party’s quadrennial gathering, even though the late date of this year’s convention coincides with the first days of Harvard’s fall semester.
Harvard’s presence at the convention reaches from the podium to the crowd, with University alumni and affiliates serving as delegates, advisers, interns, and sign-swinging supporters. From Michelle Obama, Law School Class of 1988, and Deval Patrick ’78, who spoke Tuesday, to Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday, to President Obama on Thursday, the political stage—draped in Democratic blue—has no shortage of crimson highlights.
On Wednesday, convention officials announced that the threat of rainstorms would push Thursday’s speeches, including Obama’s, indoors to the smaller arena that has hosted the rest of the week’s events. That could leave thousands of ticket holders for the planned outdoor events high and dry.
The change has left those without an official role at the convention, like Imeime A. Umana ’14 and Victoria E. Wenger ’14, uncertain if they will make the trip on Thursday.
Other students who are already on the ground are hard at work making the convention run smoothly. James Biblarz ’14 has been in Charlotte as an intern for the convention host committee for the last 14 weeks. During the internship, he wrote memos, distributed credentials to visitors, and planned parties.
Biblarz originally thought he might spend the summer working at Obama’s campaign headquarters in Chicago, but he said he ultimately decided the chance to work at his party’s convention in a traditionally Republican state was too rare an opportunity to miss. Although occasionally saddled with some mundane work, Biblarz said his time in Charlotte has been a “fantastic experience” working alongside staffers from Massachusetts and the greater Boston area.
As in Tampa last week for the Republican National Convention, the Harvard IOP temporarily relocated to Charlotte this week, hosting a series of events for Harvardians and outsiders. IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said that he and eight other staffers held a cocktail reception for Harvard students, alumni, and former IOP fellows on Monday at the Omni Hotel in Charlotte as well as a panel discussion on politics and the media.
Grayson said that the conventions help the IOP stay in touch with Harvard politicos and recruit new fellows. “Summer’s kind of winding down [and] this is a way to gear up for the semester, so it’s definitely an inflection point for us,” he said.Several Harvard staffers and professors will be at the convention in various high-profile capacities. Annie Tomasini, the director of intergovernmental relations for Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, is spending the week in Charlotte volunteering for her former boss Vice President Joe Biden. Kennedy School lecturer Elaine C. Kamarck is a member of the Democratic National Committee. And David Gergen, a Kennedy School professor, will provide on-air analysis for CNN.
Wenger worked for the Obama campaign in Chicago this summer and seriously considered taking a leave of absence to work for the campaign this fall. Although she decided to return to school, she said she was eager to remain involved in the close-knit organization of Obama organizers, students, and volunteers, many of whom will descend on Charlotte this week.
Umana, who organized Harvard’s Summer in Washington program this summer, sees the convention as a way of bringing together political networks that have been established over the years through the IOP. She said she hopes to carry that energy back to Harvard to combat political apathy among students during the semester of the election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the roughly 125 students under investigation for cheating in last spring’s class Government 1310 come back to Harvard for a semester in which they may learn they have been suspended from the University for cheating, the varsity athletes implicated in the scandal must deal with an additional layer of concerns.
Many in the class, “Introduction to Congress,” were athletes—one student accused of cheating in the course, a member of the Class of 2012 who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he said he feared repercussions from Harvard for discussing the case, estimated that more than half the class played varsity sports. Now, many of those athletes who play fall sports face the question of whether to step on the field before the Administrative Board rules on their cases.
National College Athletic Association regulations prohibit athletes from playing on a team for more than four full seasons. If an athlete were to play this fall before the Ad Board makes its decisions and then be compelled to leave Harvard mid-semester, the games that he or she had played would count as a full season for eligibility purposes.
 
The same is true for an athlete who chooses not to play although he or she is physically able. At non-Ivy League schools, players can choose to sit out a year without losing eligibility—a practice known as redshirting—but that is not an option at Harvard.
Therefore, if a student did not want to use this year of eligibility for what may end up being only a few games, he or she would have to take a leave of absence prior to the first game and come back to compete in a fifth fall.
Players taking that leave would have to do so before registering on campus to avoid running into more regulatory issues. According to the Harvard Department of Athletics Student-Athlete handbook, a student who takes a leave of absence after attending a class cannot return to the field until well after he or she has returned to school.
“In nearly all circumstances, you will be ineligible to compete in the first year you return to Harvard,” the handbook reads.
The handbook attributes this rule to the NCAA’s progress-toward-degree requirements, which demand that every student-athlete complete a certain number of courses in the previous semester and reach certain checkpoints on the way to fulfilling graduation requirements.
If a student intends to take a leave of absence, the Ivy League requires an academic adviser to certify that “the student appropriately considered academic and career goals when choosing this enrollment pattern, that the decision was in the student’s interest regardless of athletics participation, and was made by the student, without pressure to do so from a coach or other athletics department staff member,” according to an email from Ivy League Associate Director for Communications Scottie Rodgers.
Yet in an email to resident deans, Secretary of the Ad Board John "Jay" L. Ellison suggested that those deans should take students’ athletic involvement as well as their academic trajectories into consideration during their conversations with students implicated in the cheating scandal. “Fall term athletes may also want to consider taking [a leave of absence] before their first game,” he said in the email.
Athletes do commonly retain eligibility even after starting a season, via medical waiver. To qualify for another year of eligibility, the athlete must sustain the injury before the 30 percent mark in the season and a doctor must verify that the athlete has an injury that is too severe for him or her to return to the field for the remainder of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after opening its season with a tie on the road at UMass, the Harvard men’s soccer team welcomes Big Ten opponent Michigan State to Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium for its home opener Friday afternoon.
In the Spartans (1-2-1), the Crimson (0-1-1) faces its first big conference test at home since a 2-1 victory over Stanford of the Pac-12 in the 2010 home opener. Michigan State, a perennial contender in one of the biggest athletic conferences in the country, is coming to the Northeast for a pair of games against Harvard and Providence.
“Playing a higher profile team isn’t intimidating for us,” sophomore Michael Innocenzi said. “If anything, it’s better for us because we usually have a problem getting up for games because there isn’t a big crowd. On a Friday night with a team like Michigan State, I think this should get us going.”
In preparing for this weekend’s matchup, Crimson coach Carl Junot has emphasized capitalizing on opportunities in front of the net. Harvard’s only goal so far this season came from sophomore Hiroki Kobayashi in the first half of the opener. After going scoreless in a 1-0 loss against Northeastern, the team has spent the last week focusing on shooting and crossing drills.
“We’ve been shooting a lot on goal, trying to fix our goal scoring problem,” Innocenzi said.Goal scoring has been a problem that has plagued Harvard since last season, when the Crimson scored just 14 goals in 17 games. Compounding Harvard’s offensive woes is the loss of Kobayashi to injury.
Kobayashi hurt his leg in the sixth minute of Sunday’s game against the Huskies and expected to return to action this weekend. Despite him saying that it was “feeling good” he will most likely not see action until sometime next week.
Despite the loss of Kobayashi, the Crimson will benefit from the return of senior Zack Wolfenzon and sophomore Tim Schmoll from injury. Wolfenzon and Schmoll will give a needed break to some of the rookies who have seen larger-than-expected roles so far this season due to injuries and sidelined veterans.
The Spartans have had scoring woes of their own, netting just two goals in four contests so far. Defense has been one of the bright spots for Harvard as center backs senior Richard Smith and freshman Mark Ashby have teamed with freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez to limit opposing offenses to just two goals on 10 shots on goal.
“[Michigan State] is a good team, but nothing we should be afraid of,” Innocenzi said. “If we play our game and execute our game plan, we should be fine.”
Scoring notwithstanding, the Crimson’s progress so far this season has given reason for optimism among players and fans alike. The current offensive system was not instituted until the latter half of last season, and now, almost a year in, it is beginning to gain traction in the minds of the players who are executing it on a day-to-day basis.
“The past two games we haven’t been able to get the win,” Kobayashi said. “But we’re still confident in our system and are just trying to be more competitive and really perfect our style.”
On Sunday, Harvard welcomes the Southern Methodist Mustangs (0-2-1) who leave the friendly confines of  the Southwest for a northeastern road trip with Dartmouth and the Crimson.In its 107-year existence, Harvard has never played either of this weekend’s opponents. Despite this fact, there is no fear of the unknown in the Crimson locker room.
“We are always excited to play a team we haven’t played before,” Kobayashi said. “We are not afraid of them.”
This weekend’s home stand serves as a springboard into the rest of the season. Harvard hosts UConn on Sept. 14 before heading west for the Nike Central Coast Challenge against Cal Poly and UC Santa Barbara. After returning to Cambridge, the Crimson hosts Yale to start off the Ivy League campaign. Last year, Harvard went winless in the Ancient Eight for the first time in program history.
Given the state of affairs at the end of last season, the team is optimistic about its current progress.
“We’re starting to come together as a team and are really excited to show what we can do,” Innocenzi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To many Americans, the phrase “typical hockey family” evokes images of snowy Minnesota winters, frozen-over ponds, and musty gym bags. When Tjerk van Herwaarden uses it, the new Harvard field hockey coach draws on a culture much more enamored with the sport played on grass than the one on ice.
Van Herwaarden’s voyage to Cambridge, Mass., spanned two continents and about 3,500 miles, with field hockey the one constant during his journey. Born in the Netherlands to a pair of field hockey-playing parents, he was given his first stick as an infant and recalls playing in youth leagues at the age of six.
As a teenager, van Herwaarden continued playing field hockey and began coaching youth leagues in his spare time. But at 21, an injury forced him to reevaluate his playing career and subsequently pushed him deeper into coaching over the next several years.
Still, his interest in the sport was just a hobby at the time; he was working concurrently as an investment banker at SNS Bank, a Dutch firm. Eventually, he reached a crossroads in his career: If he wanted to move up in either profession, he would have to make a choice between coaching field hockey and banking. His childhood passion won out.
Van Herwaarden had held a variety of different coaching positions in the Netherlands, working with two different club teams, the Dutch youth development program, and members of the Dutch national women’s team. He was also running his own business, Worldcamp USA, which put on field hockey clinics and camps in the United States.
It was on one such trip, this time for a coaching convention, that he met University of Maryland head coach Missy Meharg, who happened to be looking to fill a hole in her staff vacated by a departing assistant coach.
“She said, ‘Tjerk, are you interested?’” van Herwaarden said. “I was 28 years old, my last time to go on a little adventure. I told myself I’d do it for two years; that was seven or eight years ago now.”
For her part, Meharg recognized an innate feel for playing and teaching field hockey in van Herwaarden, a product of his childhood spent immersed in the sport.
“This is a guy who’s grown up with [field hockey] as an integral part of his system,” Meharg said. “He’s a natural hockey player, and in that regard, he understands the game.”
Van Herwaarden spent seven seasons as an assistant head coach with the Terrapins, a remarkable run that saw the team win four ACC titles and five national championships, even earning them two trips to the White House. Yet, with Meharg firmly established as the head of the program for the foreseeable future, van Herwaarden made another career move.
In the winter of 2011, Harvard’s athletic department chose not to renew the contract of former coach Sue Caples and offered van Herwaarden the job early in the summer of 2012. Meharg noted that it was a particularly good fit given van Herwaarden’s “intellectual” approach to the sport, and he jumped at the opportunity.
“After a while, [winning] doesn’t get old, but being an associate head coach and now having a chance to have your own program—after seven years, it’s a great time,” van Herwaarden said.
Van Herwaarden understands that he has a significant rebuilding project in front of him; the Crimson hasn’t had a winning season since 2004. And though he is committed to winning, he was able to remain philosophical about losses like his new team’s disappointing 2-1 double-overtime defeat at the hands of Sacred Heart on Sept. 3.
"The harder [the girls] work, the more luck they have,” van Herwaarden said. “The small little details will be controlling the outcome. We just have to change small pieces—going one-on-one with the goalkeeper, or one-on-one defense with no cover behind you—those are the little things, and we can  practice that.”
The players have responded positively to van Herwaarden’s message of focusing on the particulars as a path to success.
“We know that good individual defense, good stick skills, and good scoring opportunities will turn into goals, and goals will turn into wins,” co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “[Van Herwaarden’s] going to push us to become winners and learn how to win the game, not just play for 70 minutes.”
Van Herwaarden’s plan to improve the program also includes gaining exposure against more talented opponents. In 2012, the Crimson is scheduled to play No. 14 Northeastern and No. 17 Boston College in non-conference play, in addition to No. 4 Princeton during the Ivy season.
“This team has already told me that they want to play a tougher schedule,” van Herwaarden said. “If you spend all this time being part of this team, why not get the best out of it? All the hours spent here, all the hours traveling, all the hours in games, taking away from everything else Harvard has to offer—it has to be worth something.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years into a career that has seen her walk away with two Ivy League titles as part of what is quickly becoming a women’s soccer dynasty, senior Taryn Kurcz has had quite a few memorably moments. But all things considered, Monday night’s game, under the lights of the “Fall Fiesta,” might have been Kurcz’s best yet at Harvard.
Although taking up a new role this season in the midfield, the Crimson senior, listed on the roster as a defender, finished Monday night’s game against local rivals Boston University having done pretty much all anyone could ask for.
Kurcz, who is also a Crimson sports executive, quickly embraced her new offensive role and displayed her prowess as an aerial threat by notching two goals off headers.
With Monday’s performance at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium, Kurcz showed why she and her teammates are still the team to beat in the Ivy League as they defend their Ancient Eight title with the start of conference play later this month.
“I think we’re just a really resilient team and that it doesn’t matter who the team is,” Kurcz said.  “If we’re down we’re not going to back down and we’re going to keep on proceeding, keep on playing our game.”
Though Harvard (1-0-1) was only able to tie a spirited Terriers (3-2-1) team, 2-2, the Crimson nonetheless maintained its unbeaten streak and ended a four-game losing streak against Boston University, the last loss to its local rivals coming in the form of a 0-3 loss in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
In the fifth minute of play, working off a long throw by senior midfielder and roommate Aisha Price, Kurcz jostled for position in front of net and, despite being marked closely by two BU defenders, fired a powerful header toward goal and over the head of the Terriers’ helpless goalkeeper.
With the goal, Kurcz notched her first goal of the season and just her second career goal for Harvard, giving the Crimson the early 1-0 lead.
In the second half, with 25 minutes left in regulation and Harvard staring down a possible fifth consecutive loss to the Terriers, Kurcz’ aerial threat once again proved instrumental for the Crimson as she connected off a beautiful set-piece free kick from junior co-captain Peyton Johnson and headed the ball into the back of the net.
With the match in extra time and two goals already to her name, Kurcz was once again at the center of the Crimson attack in the final third. In the 96th minute, Kurcz’s heading ability was once again in full display as a header almost gave her a hat-trick and nearly gifted Harvard with a golden goal victory.
In all, Kurcz’ brace and the final scoring opportunity in the dying minutes of the match capped a prolific outing for the veteran in which she quickly embraced her new role in the midfield and put on display her powerful header.
Kurcz, whose career has been marred by injuries, is now entering into her final year with the Crimson, and her constant presence has garnered nothing but respect from her fellow teammates for her versatility and energy on the field.
“Taryn is like a little bolt of lightning wherever you put her,” Johnson said. “She’s given us a spark in defense and now this season she’s given us a spark in the midfield. She’s always going to be an asset to us wherever we put her on the field.”
Kurcz spent much of the off-season in California preparing mentally and physically for the adjustment needed in shifting her role to a more offensive-minded position. Given the positive results in just the second game of the season, it looks as if that work has paid off.
“Putting her in the midfield against BU really played into the really competitive fire we were looking to create for that game,” Johnson said. “I think her playing in a central role during the game really helped that out, and I imagine that won’t stop as we move forward into the season.”

Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin '60 made a splash at a cocktail party in Charlotte, N.C., on Wednesday. Rubin, who is a member of the Harvard Corporation—the University's highest governing body—fell into a pool at the party, as recorded in a tweet by Politico writer Lois Romano. The tweet, which appears to have since been taken down, can still be seen on Topsy, a social analysis website that records tweets as a means of garnering information.
