After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Neil Patrick Harris said he probably felt more comfortable in high heels than most of his Man of the Year predecessors.
Taking a break from rehearsing his role as a transgender singer in the upcoming Broadway musical “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” the 2014 Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year accepted the Pudding Pot on Friday night and became the first openly gay man to receive the award.
Tomi J. Adeyemi ’15 and Alexander N. Muresanu ’15, producers of the Theatricals’ 166th production “Victorian Secrets,” roasted Harris with jokes about his roles in various television series and films, including  “Doogie Howser, M.D.,” “Starship Troopers,” and “Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore.”
“Well, that was fun,” Harris said as he took the stage after the roast.
Then, parodying Harris’ CBS comedy “How I Met Your Mother,” a Bob Saget character, voiced by Larkin P.D. McCann ’15, narrated Harris’ quest to attain the Pudding Pot. Before receiving his prize, Harris had to complete a series of tasks, such as feeding baby food to his castmate Jason Segel, played by Reed S. Silverman ’15. A self-proclaimed lover of magic, Harris also had to employ a wand to fight off a dementor—a haunted creature from the “Harry Potter” series—and sing a rendition of the famous “Rent” ballad “Seasons of Love,” which had been rewritten to pose the question, “Why does the whole wide world love Neil Patrick Harris?”


Presented with a wig, heels, and a bra after he completed the challenges, Harris told his hosts to “bring it on.” He finally accepted his award and planted a kiss on each of the presenters. Harris called his Pudding hosts “lovely and caring” and thanked them for “an unbelievable day.”
At a press conference after the roast, Harris spoke about receiving advice from 2012 Man of the Year honoree and co-star Jason Segel and discussed the upcoming series finale of “How I Met Your Mother,” saying his “fingers are crossed” that his character will tie the knot by the end of the show. 
The celebrated host of both the Tony and Emmy Awards also called this year’s Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres “the ultimate host.”
“I’m rooting for Ellen,” he said. “I hope she does a great job.”
The opening performance of “Victorian Secrets” followed the Man of the Year ceremony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Offense was hard to come by in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 52-45 win over Brown on Friday night. The Crimson’s usual sources of scoring were not delivering—junior guard Wesley Saunders finished 2-for-13 from the field, and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers took six shots and finished with four points. Stepping into the void was freshman forward Zena Edosomwan, whose contributions on the night illuminated both how far he had come since the beginning of the season and how much could be in store for his Harvard career.
Edosomwan had what was probably his best game in a Harvard uniform, scoring 12 points and grabbing five rebounds, four of which came on the offensive glass. It was the type of performance many expected from Edosomwan, the most highly-regarded recruit in program history, coming into the season, and one which was made all the sweeter by the extra effort he put in to adapt himself to the college game.
“Sometimes you think you are doing your best, and that’s not the case,” Edosomwan said. “Learning that, it’s frustrating at times, but the coaches are great, and my teammates were great at communicating. They never left me in the background, they were always communicating. The coaches were telling me two months ago that you never know when the moment will come.”
In discussing his transition to college basketball from his post-graduate year at Northfield Mount Herman, Edosomwan pointed out that he was accustomed to the size of his new peers, but not their physicality. He described his realization that, at the collegiate level, “you have to outwork people.” As a result, Edosomwan put in significant time during winter break to develop his game and earn the playing time that had, to that point, not been forthcoming.
“[Edosomwan]’s just been in the gym, before and after practices,” Saunders said. “Every time I walk in here, he’s always in the gym, shooting, working on jump hooks, free throws, everything.”
His commitment to work showed against one of the Ivy League’s most formidable frontcourts, with the Bears boasting the conference’s leading shot blocker in Cedric Kuakumensah and second-leading rebounder in Rafael Maia. Edosomwan more than held his own against the pair, battling them for rebounds in the post and points in the paint.
“They are not going to let me have it easy,” Edosomwan said. “These guys are really strong, so I told myself that what you gotta do is battle back. I was happy to make some plays and do some things.”
LOCKDOWN IN LAVIETES
Though Harvard’s offense was sputtering for much of the game, the Bears had it even rougher, shooting 27.3 percent from the field. Though Brown missed its share of open shots, the Crimson’s defensive effort was excellent throughout the night, in particular on a few key possessions near the end of the game. After the Bears cut Harvard’s double-digit lead to three with 2:17 remaining, the Crimson did not allow a single point.
“I thought the difference was our ability to get the necessary stops late when they were making a push down the stretch,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was very pleased with how, most of the time if you aren’t scoring well, you can kind of give in defensively, and we did not.”
Brown guard Sean McGonagill, who came into the game as the Ivy League’s leading scorer, was held to eight points on 2-for-11 shooting. Late in the game, McGonagill was hounded by Saunders, who forced the Brown star into a key travel with 1:06 left.
Harvard’s interior defense, led by senior Kyle Casey and junior Steve Moundou-Missi, mostly shut down Kuakumensah and Maia, holding them to a combined six points on 3-for-14 from the field.
SIYANI STRUGGLES
After scoring six points last Saturday against Penn, Chambers managed four points against the Bears and appeared to pass up a number of good looks at the basket.
For the season, Chambers’ offensive numbers are slightly below those of his All-Ivy freshman year. He is averaging 1.3 fewer points per game and shooting 37.6 percent from the field, as compared to his 43.4 percent mark a year ago.
“I think [Chambers] took some hurried ones in the first half, and I said something about it,” Amaker said. “I also mentioned that he shied completely away from it, and that is not what I want. I want to make sure he’s clear that we need him to be offensively aggressive, but he’s got to do a better job of picking his spots."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson icemen returned to their home rink on Friday evening for a chance to push around an old postseason foe. They didn’t know that they would have to push around their Zamboni first.
After a stalled ice resurfacer delayed the opening puck drop by 109 minutes, the Harvard men’s hockey team (7-12-3, 4-11-1 ECAC) skated to a 3-0 win over Dartmouth (4-16-3, 3-12-1) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Junior goaltender Steve Michalek posted his first shutout of the season while freshmen forwards Sean Malone, Tyler Moy, and Devin Tringale scored in the Crimson’s first win over the Big Green since game one of the first round of the 2013 ECAC Tournament.
“It’s not often you have half your team out there pushing the Zamboni across the ice,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought our guys played a solid game…. I thought we played a smart game for the most part.”
Ten minutes before the scheduled 7 p.m. puck drop, Harvard’s only Zamboni came to a halt near the press box-side crease. After the rink’s ice crew emptied the mechanized ice resurfacer of snow, an army of Harvard players pushed the vehicle off the rink. At 8 p.m., a Zamboni technician arrived at the rink and determined that the vehicle had a broken battery, and the vehicle was fully operational by 8:30 p.m. The puck finally dropped at 8:49 p.m.
The Crimson responded to its first shutout loss of the season—a 6-0 defeat to No. 11 Northeastern in the first round of the Beanpot on Monday—by handing the Big Green its own first shutout loss of the season. Few heroics were required of Michalek as Harvard limited Dartmouth to a season-best 21 shots on goal. The team will head into the consolation game of the Beanpot versus Boston University this Monday with a four-point lead over Dartmouth for 10th place in the ECAC standings.
“I thought we handled [the delay] really well,” Malone said. “We kept [ourselves] occupied in the locker room, had a pretty good time, played a few games…and were able to stay focused and get the W.”
The delay foreshadowed a bizarre game filled with big hits and altercations. Officials doled out 58 penalty minutes in the second period, 36 of which came directly after Harvard freshman forward Kevin Guiltinan laid a high open-ice hit on junior Charlie Mosey as the Dartmouth center carried the puck into the Crimson zone. The collision prompted Big Green junior forward Jesse Beamish to drop the gloves with Guiltinan while Malone wrestled with sophomore defender Geoff Ferguson.
“I saw three guys on [Guiltinan]. He’s usually a pretty physical presence out there, and I just felt obligated as his teammate to step in and help out,” Malone said.
Officials ruled that Guiltinan’s play on Mosey involved contact to the head and ejected the freshman with a game disqualification, which would result in an extra one-match suspension. Beamish received a game misconduct.
“I think any time there’s a major penalty, the league will look at it in the next couple of days,” Donato said. “After watching it [on video], I thought [Guiltinan’s hit] live looked and sounded a lot worse than it did.”
The scoreless middle frame was bookended by a power play marker from Malone in the first and two even-strength strikes from Moy and Tringale.
With freshman center Alex Kerfoot out of the lineup after being shaken up in the Beanpot, Malone took first-line power play duties. The West Seneca, N.Y., native delivered on the game’s first man-advantage situation, burying his fifth goal of the season with under four minutes to play in the opening frame. After a slap shot through the slot from freshman defenseman Victor Newell was redirected in front of the net by sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo, Malone found an opening on the right side.
In the third period, Moy found the back of the net at 7:58 after coming to the aid of senior line-mate David Valek in a battle along the right wing boards with junior Dartmouth defenseman Rick Pinkston. The freshman Harvard forward picked up the puck behind the goal line and wrapped goaltender James Kruger.
While Dartmouth had been struggling to generate opportunities on the opposite end, the insurance marker put the Crimson firmly in the driver’s seat. Tringale pushed the game out of reach less than eight game minutes later. The fourth-line forward put back a rebound under the left wing face-off circle after a close-range slapper from junior defenseman Max Everson bounced off Kruger’s chest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite forcing 19 turnovers, the Harvard men’s basketball team (18-4, 5-1 Ivy) could not get stops when it needed to in a 74-67 loss to Yale (11-9, 5-1). After the Crimson came within four with seven minutes to go, the Bulldogs scored on four of five possessions to go up by 11.
Later, after a dunk by senior forward Kyle Casey cut the deficit to six with two minutes to go, Harvard was unable to halt Yale on the defensive end without fouling. Both Casey and junior wing Wesley Saunders fouled out in the final 90 seconds, and the Bulldogs sunk eight of its final 10 free throws to ice the win.
“We feel that the league is won on Saturday nights,” co-captain Brandyn Curry said. “Those are always the toughest games, people are tired [since] you played last night. But it is definitely not an excuse…. Saturday nights, that is when you have to bring it and unfortunately we did not.”
Yale broke Harvard’s 20-game winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion, dating back to before last year’s conference season. The Bulldogs held the Crimson to 39 percent shooting from the floor, and outrebounded Harvard, 38-24, behind double-doubles from center Justin Sears and forward Armani Cotton.
Collectively, Sears and Cotton grabbed as many missed Bulldog shots as Harvard’s top two rebounders, Casey and junior Steve Moundou-Missi. Overall, Yale had 10 offensive rebounds to just 13 defensive rebounds for Harvard, which struggled to defend the tall Bulldog front. All five Yale starters were 6’4” or taller, forcing Amaker to match up 6’0” sophomore Siyani Chambers and 6’1” Curry with taller opponents.
“[Yale] definitely had an edge to them tonight with their defensive intensity,” Curry said. “They made all the shots they needed to and they got all the stops they needed to.”
Yale came out physically, pounding the ball inside to Sears. The Bulldogs jumped out to a quick 7-1 lead before a four-point play from co-captain Laurent Rivard sparked an 11-3 Harvard run, ending with a Chambers three-pointer that gave Harvard its first lead of the night.
For the rest of the half, the score stayed close. After a Sears layup with eight minutes to go gave the Bulldogs a 24-23 advantage, Yale never relinquished the lead, getting up by as many as seven points late in the first period. The Crimson stayed in the game with the long ball early, making five shots from beyond the arc and just six inside of it. Harvard converted on 63 percent of its threes in the first half before missing 11 of its final 13.
“They were the better team tonight and deserved to win,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I can’t sit here and say it is all on us. I thought they played an exceptional game and came out ready to play.”
Down four at intermission, the Crimson came out and quickly gave up the first six points of the second half to the Bulldogs. A jumper by Sears extended the lead to 10—the first time the Crimson deficit reached double digits—but Harvard responded by holding the Bulldogs scoreless for the next four minutes.
However, Yale’s defense held stout. Harvard did not score in the first five minutes of the second half and the Elis prevented the home squad from getting open looks from deep. Saunders and Rivard, who combined for 20 points and three triples in the first half, had just five points after the break, shooting a combined 2-for-15 and missing all eight three-point attempts.
“I anticipated it being one of the tougher games we would have,” Amaker said. “We have always thought of them as having great personnel…. They put on a tremendous effort to get a road win against us, something that doesn’t happen very often.”
According to Curry, the Crimson—much like last year when it won its first five league contests before dropping its sixth at Columbia—will have to come out ready to play in each game going forward.
“[Now] we have to come to work every day,” Curry said. “We have to come ready to work on Monday and have a good week every week from here on out…. I know this group, and we will respond.”

It looks like the interim dean of the College isn’t the only leader at the College who can send the student body quirky emails.
 
The current head of the College, Donald H. Pfister, has been filling undergraduates’ inboxes with messages about everything from book suggestions to plant life since last semester. But now students can look forward to receiving humorous emails from another source—the new leadership of the Undergraduate Council—and they’re adding gifs.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 sent an email to students on Thursday, addressing them as "comrades" and including references to everything from Hollywood to The Crimson to alcohol, plus gifs of President Barack Obama and Russell Crowe’s character from "Les Mis."
To top it off, the email even references the king of emails himself: "Reply to this email if you have any questions/concerns/suggestions for the Dean Pfister Appreciation Book Club," Gus and Sietse’s email reads. "This week, we are reading Little House on the Prairie." We very much hope to join.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Feb. 9, 2013
An earlier version of the caption associated with the photo accompanying this article misspelled the name of Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15.
