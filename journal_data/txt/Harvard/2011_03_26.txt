Tired of scrounging around in Lamont or Widener for a pencil to jot down the call number of a book? Harvard Library Innovation Lab has come out with a solution. Through its umbrella project ShelfLife, the Lab now offers a service that lets you text call numbers of the books you look up to yourself directly through HOLLIS.
"Our charge is to come up with new and cool ways to use libraries," said Kim Dulin, associate director for collection development and digital initiatives and co-director of the Innovation Lab. "Printing out a page or writing down the call number can be annoying."
The Innovation Lab is run through the Law School and supports projects such as Harvard Library Hose, a service that tweets when an item is checked out from the library and other services that pave the way for the future of library experiences.
