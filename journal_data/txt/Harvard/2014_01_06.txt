After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 detailed three new initiatives that they plan to implement as their term gets underway in an email to undergraduates Friday, their first official communication since unexpectedly winning control of the body in December.
Heavily laced with humor, the email outlined goals to introduce a health program for freshmen, make the UC website more user-friendly, and better bolster communication between the body and students.
“[O]ur resolution for this year is to make the UC a resource for what YOU want to get done at Harvard, by letting you know what we can do, and by listening to what exactly it is that you want us to do,” the president and vice president wrote.
In separate interviews with The Crimson last weekend, Mayopoulos and Goffard added more details to those plans and others the pair plan to put in place as their nascent term progresses.
The Freshmen Health Project, a project in the works before the election, is designed to help first-year students deal with the difficulties posed by College life on student health. The UC hopes to educate first-year students about nutrition, stress management, and physical exercise by providing incentives through contests and games.
“The whole goal of the health project is to combine short-term education with long-term goals,” Mayopoulos said.
The other initiatives laid out by Mayopoulos and Goffard aim to make the UC more accessible to students, starting with its website.
Although the current version of the site was launched less than a year ago, Mayopoulos said that it is difficult to navigate and confusing to students looking for relevant information. He said that the UC is currently working to redesign the site again to make it easier for student groups to learn how to apply for and receive funding. The body hopes to have the new site launched by the beginning of the spring term.
The UC is also seeking to implement a direct deposit program for those receiving UC grants, so that they will no longer have to pick up reimbursement checks. Goffard said that he expects the UC should be able to institute this change during the spring semester.
The UC will also be testing new ways to increase communication with students outside the digital realm. The email alluded to a Operation Ghost Protocol, which Mayopoulos said seeks to foster discussion among students and representatives with a two-prong approach.
 
“The whole operation is about requiring the UC representatives to be in the house or dining hall they were elected by and be there with information,” Mayopoulos said of the initiative’s first part, explaining that there students will be able to voice opinions to their representatives and discuss ideas. 
The second part of the protocol is designed to make the UC more transparent. Goffard said that the body plans to showcase the campaign promises of individual UC representatives on the website so students can evaluate the effectiveness of their leaders. The council will also put up posters to inform students of the time and subject matter of UC meetings.
In addition, Goffard said that he and Mayopoulos plan to attend at least three student group meetings every week so that the UC can better gauge the student needs and wants.
The amusingly named initiatives, parenthetical jokes, and humorous images interlaced throughout the email echoed the comical tone of the campaign of Mayopoulos and Sam B. Clark ’15, who together ran as a joke ticket and beat out two serious pairs of competitors. After they initially revealed plans to resign, Mayopoulos announced he would stay on as UC President, opening up a chance for Goffard.
As for the relationship between the two leaders, Goffard, who originally ran alongside former presidential candidate C.C. Gong '15, said that he will still pursue the initiatives outlined with his former running mate, but also looks forward to collaborating with Mayopoulos.
“Working with Gus will be really helpful because he brings a lot of new energy,” Goffard said of the new president, adding, “This is a major opportunity for us all to improve our student government.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School has received a $90 million gift from Ludwig Cancer Research “to spur innovative scientific inquiry and discovery,” the school announced in a press release Monday.
“This gift provides a momentous opportunity for the entire Harvard Medical School community to glean new insights into the basic biology of cancer as well as to accelerate the translation of basic research to improve patient outcomes,” Dean of the Medical School Jeffrey S. Flier said in the press release.
The bequest was made on behalf of deceased American billionaire Daniel K. Ludwig, whose estate provided funding in 2006 to establish six cancer research centers—one at the Medical School and one each at Johns Hopkins, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, MIT, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago. Each center received equal shares of the latest $540 million gift, bringing the total endowment of the Ludwig Centers to $900 million.
Since its founding, the Ludwig Center at Harvard has received $60 million from Ludwig Cancer Research to, among other efforts, support an endowment dedicated to novel cancer research endeavors and create endowed professorships at the center. Researchers across the Medical School and its affiliated centers work at the Ludwig Center.
George D. Demetri, who was appointed director of the Ludwig Center at Harvard in 2006, said in an interview with The Crimson that the first iteration of funding from Ludwig Cancer Research has allowed researchers to achieve drug discovery and development at "much more predictable, rapid, efficient and successful" levels than they would have with traditional methods. As an example, he cited the recent three-year approval process of the anticancer drug Stivarga in a climate in which the FDA typically takes as long as 20 years to approve drugs.
"This bigger grant exceeds all our wildest hopes," said Demetri, a professor of medicine and senior vice president for experimental therapeutics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. "It is one of the largest gifts ever given to Harvard Medical School for anything."
The gift, and the resultant expansion of the research activity at the Ludwig Center at Harvard, also comes with the appointment of a new co-director: Joan S. Brugge, head of the cell biology department at the Medical School.
In an interview with The Crimson, Brugge emphasized the opportunities granted by the Ludwig gift.
"The magnitude of this gift and its permanence offers the opportunity to use the Ludwig gift in unprecedented ways," Brugge said. "One thing is that we can build a critical mass in solving problems since we will be able to use much larger numbers of researchers than through any other grant mechanism program. The grant will also allow more high-risk, high-reward approaches."
Brugge added that the new funds will enable researchers to tackle the growing concern of cancer therapy resistance.
"Too many patients have to deal with the disheartening news within months or years that their tumor has relapsed and is resistant to the original treatment,” she said. “We will infuse teams with expertise from investigators outside the current cancer community to bring in new insights and fresh perspectives to break through some of the most challenging barriers we are facing in cancer treatment.”
Both directors said that they are looking forward to collaborating with scientists at other Ludwig Centers, each of which has an area of expertise.
"We're trying to build teams and bridges across these wonderful universities and eventually we work together as a national group," Demetri said.
While Harvard’s Ludwig Center focuses on cancer therapy resistance, researchers at other centers study metastasis, stem cells, the genetics of cancer, and other topics.
The co-directors also stressed the importance of research endowments like the one recently bestowed by the Ludwig Institute.
"There's a lot of pressure to decrease research funding in medicine," Demetri said. "In an age where we can sequence the genome and George Church can write books in DNA, it's our responsibility to take advantage of these technological advances to make new breakthroughs in medicine."
To date, the Ludwig Cancer Research Institute has made investments toward cancer research worth $2.5 billion.
"This is an extraordinary gift,” Demetri said. "All of us at Ludwig feel a great responsibility to put this money into the best possible use.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a victory over 24th-ranked Rider to open the dual meet portion of its schedule, the Harvard wrestling team fell behind early and could not recover from the deficit, falling to Rutgers, 24-15.
Though the Crimson (1-1, 0-1 EIWA) won more matches in competition than it lost, its forfeit at 125 lbs. and a major decision loss at 141 lbs. forced the group to play catch-up all afternoon against the Scarlet Knights (8-2, 5-0). A late comeback attempt came up short, and Harvard saw its dual meet win streak end at six.
“Today I thought we wrestled really tough,” sophomore Jeffrey Ott said. “We came into the dual meet down a weight, and the guys all responded…. We showed a lot of heart in the close matches, which is something we haven’t always been able to do.”
After a 4-2 win by Ott at 133 lbs. to open the meet, Rutgers’ freshman Tyler Dippery dealt a major blow to the Crimson’s chances of victory with a shutout of fellow freshman Colby Knight.
Filling in for sophomore Todd Preston, who sat out with the flu, and competing in the first dual meet of his collegiate career, Knight was quickly outmatched at 141 lbs., falling behind 8-0 in the first period. Not content with just the commanding lead, Dippery pinned Knight to the mat moments later to put the Scarlet Knights up, 12-3.
Riding the momentum, sophomore Ken Theobold made it two in a row for Rutgers, pinning Harvard sophomore Nicholas Stager just 36 seconds into the 149 lbs. match to extend the Knights’ advantage to 18-3. The pair of pins gave Rutgers a lead it would not relinquish.
With the meet’s outcome all but decided, Harvard captain Cameron Croy kept things interesting with a 6-4 decision victory over redshirt senior Daniel Seidenberg at 197 lbs.
Down six coming into the final match of the day, the Crimson needed heavyweight sophomore Nicholas Gajdzik to win by a pin over 19th-ranked Billy Smith to tie the Scarlet Knights.
The Rochester, MI native fought hard against the 2013 NCAA Championships at-large contender and took the match to two overtimes. But Smith had a little more in the tank at the finish line, collecting two points with the clock winding down to clinch the Rutgers victory.
“[Nicholas] did a great job today,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said “He put himself in a position to win, and [you] can’t ask for anything more than that…[against] a good wrestler like [Billy] Smith.”
All afternoon, in both its wins and losses, the Scarlet Knights made the Crimson sweat.
At 157 and 174 lbs., Harvard’s Tyler Grimaldi and Eric Morris both saw their matches be decided late in the third. Grimaldi took down Rutgers’ Corey Stasenko with seconds remaining for an 8-5 victory, while Morris was taken down by Rutgers’ Phillip Backukas and lost the match, 3-1.
Despite the loss, there were multiple bright spots for Harvard on the afternoon. With the Crimson forfeiting at 125 lbs. for the second time of the weekend, Ott opened the meet once again at 133 lbs. After losing by decision 24 hours earlier, Ott was determined to rebound.
“I’ve been struggling a little bit since I’ve injured, and I just came back to the team,” Ott said. “I made a lot of adjustments from yesterday…and it was exciting to see the changes I’ve been trying to implement [get results].”
And after running out the clock in the third period with the score tied at two against redshirt senior Vincent Dellefave, Ott seemed to be in trouble in overtime, with Dellefave grabbing the Crimson wrestler’s left leg and putting Ott on his back. But the Chelmsford, Mass. native escaped and quickly turned the tables on his opponent, scoring two points for the sudden death victory to cut the deficit to 6-3.
“Jeffrey had a rough go of things in mid-December…and yesterday didn’t go well for him, he didn’t wrestle his best,” Weiss said. “For him to turn that around…shows a lot of maturity and [the ability] to make adjustments, not focusing on the past loss and [instead] focusing on the task at hand.”
The other high note of the day for Harvard was at 165 lbs., where sophomore Devon Gobbo dominated Rutgers junior and 2013 NCAA Championship qualifier Nick Visicaro throughout for the 7-3 decision win.
“I thought we wrestled tough today, we really did,” Weiss said. “The guys wrestled with a lot of intensity and courage…. I thought we wrestled stronger today than we did yesterday [in the win against Rider].”
