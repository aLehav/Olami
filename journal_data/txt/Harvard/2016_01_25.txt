After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, former Harvard University President and current University Professor Lawrence H. Summers blamed student activists for “absurd political correctness” and “creeping totalitarianism” in education.
But for the first three years of high school, administrators barred my campus newspaper from publishing articles and op-eds I’d written on LGBTQ+ issues. I submitted them anyway, and by my senior year, I’d worn my administrators down. Then, after the newspaper published two stories I wrote on the topic, students and parents boycotted the discussion of queer people. On our website, anonymous commenters railed against the inclusion of LGBTQ+ issues in a school publication. They demanded the administration step in to stop the newspaper from publishing articles I had written.
That’s why I know that when conservatives and their centrist enablers criticize trigger warnings or student activism for impinging on free speech, it’s nonsense. Students of color have the right to a campus free from racism, and women have the right to a campus free from misogyny. All minority students have the right to a campus free from oppression. Those who criticize efforts to realize this truth—on the far right, at the center and center-left, and at Harvard—are wrong, and they are hypocritical.
Conservatives contend that minority students have invented a “right to not be offended,” refusing to acknowledge the truth of pervasive and violent oppression. They insist that students of color won’t be satisfied until professors can teach only activists’ left-wing orthodoxy. But conservatives mobilized against the 2014 AP U.S. History Course for being insufficiently pro-American. They forced the College Board to rewrite its curriculum for hundreds of thousands of students to conform to a conservative political agenda predicated on American exceptionalism.
In North Carolina, a conservative think tank closely affiliated with Republican Governor Pat McCrory is advocating that English departments restrict course offerings to the “traditional canon of Renaissance, British, or American literature.” The report warns that English majors are being exposed to “multiculturalism, feminism, postmodernism, [and] postcolonialism,” and derides as frivolous the study of women writers, queer writers, and writers of color. Shortly after the forced resignation of University of North Carolina President Tom Ross earlier this year, the Board of Governors discontinued the Africana studies and gender studies majors at North Carolina’s second-largest public university. Ross, a Democrat, was not considered an ally to McCrory and the General Assembly’s Republican majority.
Conservatives disguise their views in apocalyptic warnings about students of color, but they are the ones weaponizing education and eviscerating intellectual freedom. Contradicting their own stated values, conservatives advance the singular, unflinching supremacy of their oppressive political agenda. Meanwhile, minority students advocate only for institutions across the country to stop pretending as though it is acceptable to disagree on their value, legitimacy, and basic humanity.
After being censored and boycotted, I’m insulted that Harvard’s leaders identify student activists—this time around, students of color—as the real threat to free speech. President Faust calls it “erasing [history]” to change the names of Harvard buildings, but she will not call it racism when students of color are forced to live, study, and work on a campus that glorifies slaveholders. Larry Summers calls it “creeping totalitarianism” to treat microaggressions as though they are “morally serious.” But he will not call it sexism when a university president says women are underrepresented in STEM fields because of “intrinsic aptitude.”
When people call it fascism or censorship or coddling when minority students demand a campus that is safe for them, that’s wrong. It’s discrimination and it’s dangerous. And we should call it oppression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, the Making Caring Common Project at the Graduate School of Education published a report analyzing the flaws of the current college admission process. The report, a product of extensive research and innumerable conversations, pinpoints three discrete issues with the current system that must be improved, each followed by several recommendations for action.
The report correctly identifies a serious problem with the college admission process: It sends “young people messages that emphasize personal success rather than concern for others and the common good.”
As it stands, many applicants believe that they should push themselves to take as many rigorous classes as possible, score highly on standardized tests, and travel the world doing service in order to be serious applicants. In this system, affluent students are often at an unfair advantage; meanwhile, all students of all socioeconomic backgrounds suffer undue amounts of stress.
For these reasons, the college admission process should be reoriented—as the report suggests and we have previously acknowledged—towards seeking out students who are as conscionable and conscientious as they are intelligent and driven. Despite its good intentions, however, this move to fix the admission process is ambitious at best. The underlying problems with the process run much deeper than this report could hope to address.
The report's recommendations have the potential to affect serious change in the American college admission process, and they include several actionable ideas for rethinking the definition of success so that it benefits thoughtful, genuine people rather than competitive, dishonest, and often wealthy robots. These recommendations, which all argue for quantity over quality in everything from community service endeavors to coursework, certainly need to be communicated to students.
That said, admission committees should ensure that these recommendations do not shortchange those exceptional students who are happiest taking a heavy course load or participating in multiple student organizations. It is, after all, that type of student Harvard hopes to educate.
In this vein, admission committees and high school guidance counselors should particularly emphasize the report’s fifth recommendation under its third area of consideration:  “expanding students’ thinking about ‘Good’ colleges.” Perhaps the biggest stressor for students applying to college is that they believe they must go to an elite institution. Harvard and its peers should make clear that applicants should not force themselves to be people they are not solely to gain admission to a university with a low acceptance rate.
There is also much work to be done in reconciling the findings of this report with Harvard's practice of taking legacy into account in the admission process. If an overhaul of the admission process is to productively make room for low-income students at Harvard, it must not only discourage resume padding in its students but also abolish its own systemic flaws. This report has contributed to exposing some of those issues, but further factors deserve similar attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police Department has not identified the perpetrator responsible for the November vandalism of black Law School professors’ portraits and shuttered its investigation into the incident, ending more than a month of interviews and forensic examinations.
On November 19, Law School students and faculty arrived in Wasserstein Hall to find pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of several black Law professors. The incident, quickly denounced by students and Law School administrators as racist, prompted HUPD to investigate it as a hate crime.
Law School Dean for Administration Francis X. McCrossan wrote in a Jan. 8 email to Law School affiliates that the investigation would remain closed “pending further new and significant information.” He also wrote that new security camera equipment would be installed in Wasserstein Hall, the building where the pieces of black tape were found.
“As an academic community, we place great value on maintaining a largely open campus,” McCrossan wrote. “But we must balance that openness with the equally important need for safety.”
At least part of Wasserstein Hall—a main thoroughfare on the Law School’s campus— did not have security cameras at the time of the incident, requiring police officers to conduct the investigation using forensic evidence from the portraits and interviews with Law School affiliates. HUPD closed its investigation after their efforts yielded no information about the perpetrator, according to Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for the department.
“After pursuing these avenues, they were unable to identify the person or persons responsible for placing the tape on the portraits, or to determine the motivation for these acts,” Catalano wrote in an email.
Leland S. Shelton, the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, said he hoped HUPD had thoroughly investigated the incident.
“I hope that this is a chance to move forward from last semester’s events,” he said.
At a meeting the day of the November incident, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said racism was a “serious problem” at the school. The vandalism prompted student activism on campus, as a group of Law students released a set of demands in early December calling for better treatment of minority students on campus, later protesting what they called an inadequate response from administrators. Meanwhile, Minow and other administrators said they would work to diversify the Law School’s faculty and hire a staff member to focus on issues related to diversity.
The incident also intensified existing calls by student members of the group Royall Must Fall to change the Law School’s controversial seal, which features the crest of a slaveholding family. In late November, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow created a committee to reconsider the seal. The committee is scheduled to release its recommendations in March.
Alexander J. Clayborne, a student activist involved in Royall Must Fall, said the investigation’s conclusion does not mark an end to discussions of race on campus.
"Racism on campus is the actual perpetrator,”  Clayborne wrote in an email on behalf of Royall Must Fall. “While it would have been nice to catch the guilty party, until the University addresses its systemic racism, incidents like this are just going to keep happening.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a year after the City of Cambridge formally began planning its construction, a new stand-alone public toilet in Harvard Square is finally close to flushing.
According to Kathy Watkins, the assistant commissioner of engineering for Cambridge’s Department of Public Works, the toilet now only needs electricity to be installed, which she anticipates will take place in the next couple of weeks.
Located in General MacArthur Park between Harvard Yard and the Old Burying Ground along Massachusetts Avenue, the opening of the public toilet comes after years of discourse between Cambridge residents and city officials.
“We’re very anxious to get it completed,” Wilkins said. “It has been a fairly long process just in terms of getting it constructed.”
The toilet’s structure is modeled after the Portland Loo, a public toilet originating in Portland, Ore., because of its sleek stainless steel design, its track record of holding up well in cities with similar weather, and its maintainability, Watkins said.
The movement for a public toilet in Harvard Square first rose to prominence in the spring of 2013, after several Cambridge-area religious organizations and the Harvard Square Business Association started Advocates for a Common Toilet, a group to petition for the construction of a permanent public toilet in the Square.
The city announced plans for the toilet in 2014 and at the time, expected construction to be completed that fall or early in the spring of 2015. However, delays delivering structures and coordinating utilities pushed the toilet’s opening more than a year off schedule, according to the Cambridge Department of Public Works website.
The impending opening may come as welcome news to Cambridge students and residents. A report presented by the Cambridge’s Public Toilets Working Group in February of 2014 found that 79 percent of 716 respondents chose Harvard Square, among other options including Kendall and Central Square, as the area where they have experienced the greatest need for public toilets.
“I’ve witnessed a homeless man pouring a bottle of his urine into the the drain next to Wigglesworth, which is both degrading and unsanitary,” Daniel Um ’19 said. “Establishments like Au Bon Pain and Panera use combination locks on their bathrooms so I don’t know where he could have gone.”
Others are nonetheless skeptical that one toilet will be enough to alleviate the full need for public restrooms in Harvard Square.
“It is only one toilet,” Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson said. “It’s going to help, of course, but it’s not enough.”

Harvard Business School has long had a strong network of alumni in New York City, and now the school is capitalizing on that support by launching a startup incubator in Manhattan to provide collaborative workspaces and connect entrepreneurs with HBS degrees.
Launched last week by the Business School’s Rock Center for Entrepreneurship, Startup Studio will connect entrepreneurs—focusing on Business School alumni—to provide support to teams of business people selected for participation.
“Our goal is to foster connections and collaborations among Business School alumni to support founders, investors, or any alumni who have joined one of the numerous high growth startups for which New York City is becoming known,” Avani Patel, a startup founder and the new director of the facility, wrote in an email.
In order to be eligible for the Startup Studio, at least one founder of the company must be a Business School graduate. Teams of no more than seven employees with at least $500,000 in seed funding can apply for access to the Studio’s space, programming, and mentoring.
The inspiration for the Startup Studio primarily came from the success the Business School has had with its alumni programming, according to Jodi M. Gernon, director of the Rock Center.
Gernon said the center’s annual “Rock 100” summit, an event that brings alumni founders from across the globe together each year, has demonstrated how powerful the Business School can be as a catalyst for developing startups.
Founders of the studio hoped to “unlock the HBS network,” Gernon said, adding that New York City was an obvious choice for the studio given its popularity among alumni.
Although Gernon characterized the founding of Startup Studio as “more like a soft launch” and “definitely a test run,” especially because the current location is an interim space, she said she could imagine expanding the number of locations.
Anne F. Webber ’03, a co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Legal Hero—one of the initial nine teams chosen for the Studio—said she heard about the new program through the “HBS grapevine.”
“I thought it would be a great opportunity to be around other teams working on interesting businesses,” Webber wrote in an email.
Legal Hero connects businesses with lawyers. Other teams chosen for the initial group include a venture that provides at-home educational content and another that creates beverage for expectant mothers.
Webber said the studio provides “an immediate feedback loop,” which is a valuable tool for growing businesses.
The incubator’s programming will include advising on specific industries, founders’ forums, and events aimed at strengthening professional relationships.
“We plan to build relationships that can be utilized by companies to accelerate growth,” Patel said.

After tense negotiations,  Harvard and its largest employee union have reached a tentative settlement on a three-year long contract that comes nearly four months past the expiration of their previous agreement.
The new contract—which is pending vote by members of  the organization, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—provides union employees new health plan features and a new premium contribution tier for individuals earning less than $55,000, according to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger. The settlement will also provide employees in the union with annual pay increases, an element of their previous 2013 contract with Harvard, which ended on Sept. 30. Pay increases are scheduled for Oct. of  2016 and 2017, and union members will receive retroactive pay increases for 2015. 
The union will circulate full details about a new health plan and the tentative changes to HUCTW’s contract to members this week, according to Carrie Barbash, a union organizer for HUCTW.
The prolonged round of contract negotiations—which began last spring—has been contentious, requiring dozens of meetings between Harvard and Union representatives, as well as outside mediators once it became clear discussions would extend past the expiration of the previous contract. In mid-December, Jaeger called the back and forth “very frustrating.” Negotiations for the previous contract, which settled in 2013,  lasted the longest time span in the union’s history.
Barbash and Jaeger said HUCTW compromised the most on health benefits, a central topic of the negotiations.
The new HUCTW contract moderately expands patient copayments instead of establishing deductibles, Jaeger said. Also new in the contract is the development of a premium tier for union employees earning less than $55,000 a year as their full time salary. Under the new premium tier, almost 40 percent of HUCTW union members will pay $400 less in annual premiums, Jaeger said.
The contract agreement comes more than a year after Harvard announced a controversial health care benefits package for non-union faculty and staff members in fall of 2014. Professors criticized the changes for the introduction of copayments and deductibles for non-routine health appointments, arguing that the plans would disproportionately burden junior faculty members and faculty members with families. Last fall, Harvard added additional health benefits plans for non-union employees.
In addition to reducing healthcare costs, HUCTW and Harvard established a round of salary increases, which Barbash praised in light of the rising cost of living in the Boston area.
“Our goal is to make sure that people who come in and work hard and use their skills at Harvard everyday are moving forward ahead of the inflation rate,” Jaeger said.
Barbash said decreases in affordable housing—a major topic in the recent Cambridge City Council election and a metric she said is not reflected in the local inflation rate—featured prominently in wage increase negotiations.
“People have to move further away,” Barbash said. “If they want to buy [houses], they often wind up living further away. If they rent, they live closer.”
Jaeger estimated that a majority of HUCTW members rent homes, and that HUCTW union members are making “really hard trade offs” between commuting times and rising housing costs.
HUCTW members are expected to put the new contract up for vote on Feb. 25. A simple majority of union members present for the vote is required to ratify the new agreement. Jaeger said he is optimistic that HUCTW will vote in favor of the contract.
“My best guess is that it’s going to be a pretty good turnout and a pretty positive ‘yes’ vote on the 25th, but that's for the members of the union to say,” Jaeger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde’s imminent departure has left many undergraduates in Mather questioning his sudden exit and praising his involvement in the House, where he currently lives.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has not publicly commented on the matter since announcing Lassonde’s departure from one of the College’s top administrative posts in a brief email last Friday. In the message, Khurana thanked Lassonde for his tenure at the helm of the Office of Student Life and wrote that Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will serve in the post until the College finds a replacement.
Lassonde, who will no longer be an employee of Harvard College on Feb. 1, was scheduled to teach a course and lead the search for Currier’s new House masters. In the days since Khurana detailed Lassonde’s departure—and with his course listing now inactive—undergraduates praised Lassonde, who has declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding his exit. 
In an emailed statement, Michael D. Rosengarten, Co-Master of Mather House lauded Lassonde, who lives on the 19th floor of Mather's tower. Rosengarten said he and Christie McDonald, the other co-Master of Mather House, were “so surprised” when they learned the news late Friday afternoon.
“Dean Lassonde is a highly valued member of the Mather community and… I was surprised at the announcement and that I was made aware of his transition by the email from Dean Khurana,” Rosengarten later wrote in an email.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the specifics of Lassonde’s departure.
For many Mather undergraduates, Lassonde’s exit would mean a loss for the House.
“He was always a friendly face in Mather,” said Mather House Committee Chair Avni Nahar ’17. “It was always nice to see him and his wife in the dining hall or on the shuttle.” Nahar said she sent an email to Lassonde on Friday to thank him for his tenure and lament his departure.
Al B. Corvah ’18, a Crimson business editor and one of Mather’s Undergraduate Council representatives, said Lassonde helped him acclimate to the House.
“He really made me feel at home,” Corvah said.
Corvah said Lassonde’s influence has extended beyond Mather House, emphasizing that Lassonde was “deeply involved,” with both the UC and the Black Men’s Forum.
Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, another Mather House UC representative, said Lassonde attended many of the Council’s general meetings.
“No other administrator did that,” Gonzalez said. “It was such a nice presence to have him there.”
Gonzalez lauded Lassonde for what he said was an effort to get to know and remember undergraduates.
“He genuinely remembers students,” Gonzalez said. “Even though I’m one of hundreds, maybe thousands of students he interacted with… he remembered my name.”
Nahar and Gonzalez said that Mather residents are questioning why Lassonde is leaving his post.
“Students have definitely been curious,” Nahar said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a little over two minutes left on the clock in the fourth quarter, senior Shilpa Tummala shook her defender and took a three with the shot clock winding down—and for the first time in 33 minutes Harvard had the lead over Dartmouth, 63-62.
During the next two minutes of the contest, the Big Green would go on to score 7 more points, while the Crimson mustered only one more basket. The lack of offensive production down the stretch handed the Harvard women’s basketball team (6-9, 1-1 Ivy) its first conference loss of 2016. Win the win Dartmouth (6-12, 1-1) avenged a n earlier season loss in Hanover.
In a game that saw the Crimson trail throughout most of the matchup, a late comeback against the Big Green was not enough to put the team ahead. After going down late, Dartmouth responded in the manner it had the whole night— with a three of its own only seconds after. After four trips to the line, the Big Green walked out of Lavietes Pavilion with its first Ivy League win of the season, 70-64.
“We have a very, very young team,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We rely on everyone to think the game and know the game. While that comeback was a really good comeback, we’ve got to play smart and we didn’t.”
This year’s team is comprised of seven  freshmen, making them the most represented class in this 2015-2016 squad.
This was the second time in two weeks that the teams game head to head, with an earlier match up taking place on Jan. 9 in which Harvard came away with a 56-43 victory. This time around, the Crimson couldn’t seem to make up the deficit of a difficult first quarter that saw Harvard shoot 23.5 percent while allowing 46.4 percent shooting from the Big Green.
“A lot of shots didn’t fall,” Delaney-Smith said. “We got away from our system and executing our system. That’s what we’ve been trying to do. I’m pretty disappointed with the whole game. We’re better than that.”
Despite turning the ball over a season-low eight times, Harvard couldn’t close out its late run in the fourth, missing its last five shots and sending Dartmouth to the line for the Big Green’s last five points.
After holding Dartmouth to a season low 43 points in their previous meeting- a game in which Harvard led for the vast majority - the Crimson found itself trying to make up an early deficit on Saturday afternoon against the Big Green.
Despite coming up with offensive boards and steals, Harvard simply couldn’t get shots to fall early in the game.
It was again the Crimson’s three seniors that led the way for Harvard— forward AnnMarie Healy and guards Tummala and Kit Metoyer combined for 43 points and 18 rebounds. Healy and Tummala lead the team in scoring thus far this season, with 14.9 and 13.3 points per game, respectively.
Despite the effort, Harvard couldn’t find a way to shut down Dartmouth’s two leading scorers. Sophomore guard Kate Letkewicz lead the way for the Big Green with 26 points and 17 rebounds while senior forward Lakin Roland added 18 and 11.
“She did the same thing to us over and over and over with no game adjustment from us,” Delaney-Smith said. “Someone has to step up and do something.”
In the second half the Crimson  capitalized off of Dartmouth errors, more than doubling the Big Green’s points off turnovers and second chance points. Harvard totaled eight steals in the second half and shot 40 percent, but timely shots kept Dartmouth in the lead.
“Basketball is a game of runs,” Healy said. “They had their run and we came back and had our run and it feels good, but one thing we’re going to be working on is consistency. It’s okay to be punched in the mouth and they hit some clutch shots but when that happens we get right back up and do the same thing.”
For much of the fourth quarter the Crimson traded shots with the Big Green. Despite making big stops in the third quarter to close the deficit, Harvard struggled to make hold on late in the game.
With both teams in the bonus early in the fourth, the Crimson got to the line on key possessions, but struggled to keep Dartmouth from scoring or making it to the line. The combination of Letkewicz and Roland scored nine of the Big Green’s last 10 points to hand Harvard the loss.
“What it came down to, especially in those last five minutes, was defensive breakdowns,” Healy said. “I think that a lot of emphasis are on those last five minutes but there were always ways in the first, second, and third quarters that we could’ve won that game.”

While most people spent their Saturday getting ready for and weathering the snow storm, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team (2-3, 2-1 Ivy League) rounded out its home streak with a game against No. 5 Rochester (5-2). The Crimson lost in a close 5-4 decision to the Yellowjackets, ending its stretch at the Murr Center with a two-win, two-loss split.
Harvard entered the game poised to rebound from its loss last week against St. Lawrence, while Rochester looked to avenge a first round CSA championships loss to the Crimson and continue its Ivy sweep after a pair of weekend wins against No. 8 Columbia and No. 2 Yale, in which the team dealt Yale its first loss of the season.
“We were feeling confident and prepared.” freshman Alexi Gossett said. “Rochester is one of the best teams right now and they'd come off a good win against Yale, so we knew we would have a tough match.”
With the game against No. 10 Franklin and Marshall planned for Sunday cancelled due to snowstorm Jonas, the Crimson was able to focus all its energy on Saturday’s game.
It was a hard fought game on the courts, with over half of the matches being played to four or five games. Harvard took an early lead with three wins in the first four matches. Sophomore Mandela Patrick earned the first win of the day with a 11-7, 11-8, 12-10 sweep of Rochester’s Rodrigo Porras in the ninth position.
At the No. 6 position, junior co-captain Devin McLaughlin remained undefeated on the season with another 3-0 sweep of Michelangelo Bertocchi, holding him to under eight points each game. His fellow co-captain Bryan Koh avoided a sweep to win 3-2 at the No. 3 position. After losing two close games against Neil Cordell, Koh won three straight. With this win Koh improves to 4-1 on the season.
“As a team, we battled in every match and were leading for much of the way,” Gossett said. “Bryan had a huge win at the number 3 position coming back from 2 games (or sets) down to set the tone.”
The Yellowjackets began to rally after this first wave of matches, and went on to win two of the following three matches. Junior Dylan Murray fell to Lawrence Kuhn at the No. 5 position in a 3-0 sweep. Sophomore Bradley Smith, playing at the No. 2 position, took the first game 11-7, but dropped the next three 5-11, 8-11, 6-11 against CSA first team All-American Ryosei Kobayashi, who improved to 5-1 on the season.
Freshman Seif Eleinen earned the last Crimson win of the day. He continued his undefeated streak with a 3-1 decision over Rochester’s Ben Pitfield in the eighth position. Gossett lost a hard-fought 3-1 match at the No. 7 position, falling 10-12, 5-11, 11-8, 7-11 to Aria Fazelimanesh.
At the fourth position, sophomore Madhav Dhingra, who had battled a virus all week, played a marathon match against Rochester’s Tomotaka Endo. Dhingra took the first game, winning by just two points, but dropped the next two. The fourth game was a thriller, with Dhingra coming out on top 16-14 to tie the match at two apiece. The deciding game was a quick one, with Dhingra falling 5-11.
With the game tied at four matches, it came down to the game at the No. 1 position to decide the winner. Sophomore David Ryan, who looked to rebound from his first loss of the season last week, had his work cut out for him against Rochester’s other first team All American, Mario Yanez. Ryan ended up being swept by Yanez, though all three games were hard fought and the first and third games were lost by a margin of just two points.
“I think overall we are getting better week by week,” Koh said. “We started the season off not as well as we wanted to, and since then we’ve been getting better every week. So I think for training we’re just going to prepare as we would as usual….and then then hopefully apply those to our matches.”

In the first round of the ITA Kick Off in Fort Worth, Texas, the Harvard men’s tennis team was shut out, 4-0, at the hands of Oklahoma State. The No. 32 Crimson (2-1, 0-0 Ivy) fell to the No. 28 Cowboys (4-0) and only won one set in the team’s first road action of 2016.
Coming off back-to-back victories over William & Mary and Boston College, Harvard was unable to match the level of success it had at home to begin the season.
“It was our first [match] outdoors after playing most of the end of the fall indoors,” sophomore Kenny Tao said. “It was a tough adjustment for most of our players.”
The Crimson is typically more of an indoors team, so the quick change to playing outdoors was a complicating factor for Harvard.
“When you have wind, when it’s cold outside, when the balls are just bouncing really slow, it’s tough to play the same style,” Tao said.
The doubles pairing of junior Sebastian Beltrame and Tao came the closest to winning a match for the Crimson. After a back-and-forth battle with sophomore Temur Ismailov and junior Lucas Gerch, Harvard’s second doubles duo was defeated, 7-5.
Aside from second doubles, the Crimson struggled in its other matchups against Oklahoma State. The two teams’ differing styles of play were a factor, as the Cowboys were able to slowly wear down a more aggressive Harvard team.
“Our team is made up of mostly attacking players, so sometimes when we play teams that are more scrappy and gritty, they’re able to extend the points against us when we’re trying to play shorter points,” senior Nicky Hu said.
Of the five matches that finished, the Crimson lost each and did not win a single set.
At second singles, Oklahoma State junior Arjun Kadhe defeated junior Brian Yeung, 6-1, 6-2.
Beltrame had a close battle with Cowboys sophomore Julian Cash in their first set, but he ended up dropping the decision, 7-5. In the second set, Cash pulled away early and earned a 6-1 victory. Gerch, meanwhile, defeated Tao in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4.
At first doubles, the Cowboys duo of Cash and Kadhe bested Harvard’s team of Hu and Yeung, 6-3.
Despite the two teams being ranked closely, Oklahoma State managed to earn a convincing win by drawing out points and making sure Harvard players could not play their typical fast-paced, aggressive style.
“Oklahoma State has historically always had a really great team,” Hu said. “They just built a great new indoor facility, so they’ve gotten some great recruits over the last couple of years. We knew they were going to be a very tough team.”
Of the four matches that did not finish, two were closely contested by Crimson players.
At first singles, Hu managed to take the opening set from Ismailov, 6-2. In the second set, Ismailov rallied to earn a close victory and tie the match, 6-4.
The matchup between Cowboys sophomore Tristan Meraut and Harvard freshman Andy Zhou was possibly the most closely-contested of the day. The two battled to a 6-6 tie in the first set, and Meraut went on to win the tiebreaker and the set.
In doubles action, Crimson seniors Conor Haughey and Kelvin Lam were winning the first set, 6-5, against Oklahoma State sophomore Lukas Finzelberg and junior Jurence Mendoza, but the set went unfinished.
Although the results on paper were disappointing for Harvard, the team came away from the matches with some positives.
“I think on the positive side we found a lot of things we need to work on, and that’s always good to have and good to keep in the back of your mind because we’re looking to be the best team we can be at the end of the season,” Hu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Winter Storm Jonas rolled in across the East Coast, the Harvard wrestling team’s plans to take on Franklin & Marshall (3-10, 0-6 EIWA) and Bucknell (6-5, 2-2) over the weekend remained unclear throughout the week. On Thursday, the team was finally notified that it would travel that day to Lancaster, PA, and wrestle both matches a day earlier than previously scheduled.
In spite of the hectic schedule, difficult traveling conditions, and automatic forfeits from injuries, the Crimson (4-2, 2-1) returned safely to campus with two decisive wins.
“We weren’t sure when we were going to wrestle or if we were going to get to wrestle at all, so from all that to come away with two wins was really exciting for everybody,” co-captain Patrick Hogan said.
HARVARD 26, BUCKNELL 21
Last year, Harvard suffered a 26-9 defeat at the hands of the Bison. This time around, with renewed energy this year, the team started off strong and turned the tables to eke out a victory.
With a forfeit due to an injury at 125, the Crimson started off at a 6-0 deficit.
Harvard claimed the next five matches, bumping the Crimson to a 26-6 lead.
“Bucknell is a tough team, but I think we just got off to a really good start,” Hogan said. “We had a ton of energy coming off the bench and everyone was very excited about the performance right off the bat.”
At 141, senior co-captain Todd Preston had a rematch against Bucknell sophomore Tyler Smith. Coming off a loss the day before against his Franklin & Marshall opponent, Preston came back for a critical pin with only ten seconds left on the clock.
“I only beat [Smith] three nothing last year, but this year I was actually able to step over on his shot and secure the pin,” Preston said. “Having a clear head, no worries, being able to put adversity aside and get back to basics really helped.”
Junior Jeffrey Ott and senior Devon Gobbo also contributed a pin, while Hogan held off his opponent for a decision victory and sophomore Tyler Tarsi won in a technical fail.
Although the Bison took the next four matchups in three decision victories and a forfeit at 285, the Crimson’s critical pins allowed Harvard to maintain an advantage and end the day with a comeback win.
“To be able to pull out a win like that yesterday, giving up two forfeits, that’s huge,” Preston said. “Being down 12 points right out the gun, you know that everyone has to do their best to help the team…. It’s not normal in college wrestling to be able to get four or five pins, but we did it.”
HARVARD 32, FRANKLIN &MARSHALL 18
With a 0-6 disadvantage, Ott started off the matchup on Friday with a clean pin only 44 seconds into his match at 133. In the next match, however, Preston was unable to escape his opponent’s hold and fell to No. 15 Franklin & Marshall junior Richard Durso.
“It was tough to lose, but it was good to know that I definitely have things to work on especially looking forward to the next few months,” Preston said.
With the Crimson trailing the Diplomats 9-6, freshman Thomas Dutton took to the mat. Less than two minutes in, the New York native pinned Franklin & Marshall junior Jason Bing, putting Harvard in the lead 12-9.
The Crimson claimed the next three matchups as junior Colby Knight pinned his opponent, Gobbo won in a technical fail, and sophomore Josef Johnson took home a decision victory.
Harvard solidified a 10-point lead with its fourth pin of the day from senior Josh Popple. The Diplomats’ last two wins were not enough to close the gap, and Harvard took home the victory.
“Everyone really knows the technique that we’re supposed to do, so it’s really about getting the stuff in practice consistently in every match,” Hogan said.“I think that showed this weekend, and it really paid off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team found itself playing from behind for most of the day against Cornell, and with the Big Red up 3-1 and looking for the clinching point, the Crimson had one final opportunity to break through.
Harvard freshman Sabrina Xiong took the first set of her match, while sophomore Nikki Kallenberg came back from a 6-0 loss in her first set to win the second, 6-2. With all of the momentum on her team’s side, captain Amy He had a chance to put the Crimson firmly in the driver’s seat. After dropping her first set, 6-3, she was up 5-3 in the second and serving for the tie.
However, He’s opponent, Cornell sophomore Lizzie Stewart, caught fire and reeled off four straight games to put her away, 6-3, 7-5. Though Xiong and Kallenberg went on to win their matches, Stewart’s strong finish had already clinched the overall dual-match victory for the Big Red.
While Cornell (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) now looks to continue its strong start to the season after its 4-3 triumph, Harvard (0-1, 0-1 Ivy) must regroup ahead of a busy schedule in the next few weeks.
“Overall, I’m pleased with how the team competed today,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “We need to work on our consistency and first serve percentages, but in general, I’m proud of our effort.”
The battle for the doubles point to start the day was close, as each match finished with the same 6-4 margin. The Big Red was able to grind out two wins to Harvard’s one, however, taking the doubles point and a slim advantage heading into singles.
The Crimson’s only doubles victory came courtesy of senior Amanda Lin and sophomore Annika Ringblom, the No. 52 ranked pairing nationally according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA). The duo remains undefeated this season, moving to 5-0.
“I thought doubles could have gone either way,” Green said. “When you play one set, it goes by quickly and you don’t really have time to adjust. Today, it came down to just a few points here and there.”
Cornell used the momentum from its strong performance in doubles to seize control early in the singles matches too. Big Red players won the first set in four of the six contests.
Only freshmen Erica Oosterhout and Sabrina Xiong won first sets for Harvard, despite the fact that they were also the only ones playing their first official dual-match. Both went on to win in straight sets, with Oosterhout defeating Cornell senior Jane Stewart, 7-5, 6-2, and Xiong overcoming Big Red sophomore Priyanka Shah, 6-4, 6-3.
“It was exciting to be back on the court,” Xiong said. “We didn’t win today but it was good to play Cornell, some Ivy competition. It’s a good starting point for us.”
Of the four Crimson players who lost their first set, only Kallenberg was able to come back to force a third set, against Alexandra D’Ascenzo. Though the Big Red had clinched a victory in the overall proceedings by the time they played the final set, it still proved to be a thrilling encounter.
After reaching 6-6, with Kallenberg coming back from being broken two times, the set went to a tiebreaker that was just as tightly contested. Kallenberg prevailed 7-4, finishing off the back-and-forth, 0-6, 6-2, 7-6 (4), victory.
“In the first set, she came out fast and ran away with it,” Kallenberg said. “I made some adjustments that helped me in the second set, but then in the third, she made her own. The third set was when we were both at our best. My experience definitely helped me pull that one out.”
The No. 125 player in the nation according to the ITA rankings, Kallenberg will look to continue drawing on her experience playing as the Harvard No. 1 last year to help lead the team in 2016.
The game was one of many firsts, from being the first one of the year for the entire team to the first official dual-match in the two freshmen’s careers.
“The first match of the season provides something to build onto,” said Crimson team manager Alec Grigorian, who was also overseeing his first game. “Hopefully, it only gets better from here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing its last game before starting a key stretch of games that will see the Crimson play three ranked opponents in the span of five days, the Harvard women’s hockey team (11-7-1, 8-5-1 ECAC) broke a three game losing streak by defeating conference foe Dartmouth (4-13-3, 4-7-3), 2-0, at Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
The Crimson offense chipped away at the Big Green defense and goalkeeper Robyn Chemago, firing a season high 40 shots at the junior from Slave Lake, Alberta after failing to break the 30 shot barrier in its last eight games.
Sophomore forward Karly Heffernan got the scoring started for Harvard with a great individual effort in the first stanza. After classmate Dani Krzyszczyk found the forward near the center, Heffernan made her way down the ice, juking the Dartmouth defenders before firing a shot into the far corner.
“As I was going down the ice I just needed to get a shot off,” Heffernan said. “The [defender] was closing me out to the boards, so I just took the puck around her and chipped the puck towards the net and it went in…it needed to happen early on in the game.”
The sophomore’s fourth goal of the season was part of an offensive onslaught that saw the Crimson outshoot the Big Green 14-4 in the first period.
Harvard continued to pile the pressure early in the second stanza, as the Crimson dominated the boards and kept Dartmouth in its own defensive zone following a Dartmouth penalty.
While the Big Green ultimately killed the penalty, the siren went off just a few seconds later as Harvard doubled its advantage thanks to another goal from the second unit.
Junior blueliner Abbey Frazer and sophomore forward Lexie Laing played the puck back and forth before Frazer found Laing outside the crease following a controlling possession around the boards. Laing fired a shot at goal that snuck past Chemago and trickled into the goal for her fifth goal of the season.
“Our second line did a tremendous job today,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Lexie Laing did very well in all three zones, she hustled, she back pressured.”
Though the Dartmouth attack sparked back to life, the Crimson kept the Big Green in check for the rest of the game. Captain goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer recorded her 17th career shutout and tallied 23 saves while her teammates helped out by blocking 13 Dartmouth shots. Harvard ultimately outshot its opponents by a 40-23 margin. This was the fifth shutout of the year for the team.
While the Crimson’s victory­–paired with results from around the league–puts the team in fourth place in the ECAC going into games against conference leaders Quinnipiac and Princeton, Stone believes the team still has plenty of work to do. One of the biggest issues the team has had to deal with is turnovers. Losing possession of the puck–particularly in the neutral and defensive zones–has disrupted the Harvard attack on multiple occasions and left them vulnerable to counterattacks.
Though the Crimson was not punished for its mistakes against the Big Green, turning the puck over could be a big issue once the stretch of the schedule during which the team faces ranked opponents.
Lack of cohesion within the lines has also come to be a weakness for Harvard. While Stone and her assistants have shifted the units around to find a formation that clicks almost seamlessly, it has proved difficult to form lines that garner the ideal results. Injuries have been one of the leading forces behind the necessity to try different combinations, as the team has gone to the bench more often since returning from winter break.
“I know we can play better,” Stone said. “We can ask more of ourselves individually and collectively. We turn the puck over so much. We put lines together that we think are going to have great jam and great energy, and it’s not clicking right now.”
With conference games coming up against Quinnipiac and Princeton–both ranked in the top-ten–as well as a Beanpot matchup with top-ranked Boston College, the Crimson will need to fix these mistakes if it wishes to sweep its opponents and re-establish itself as one of the elite teams in the nation.
While the team will have a week to get ready for its upcoming opponents, the victory over Dartmouth gives Harvard some much needed momentum heading into a potential season-defining stretch.
“This game was one of the biggest ones of the year so far.” Heffernan said. “Getting our momentum back, we were on a three game losing streak so being able to get this win going into a tough weekend…it was huge for us, getting back into our game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its third weekend of action this year, the Harvard track and field teams gave a number of stellar performances while competing at the Rod McCravy Invitational and Joe Donahue Games, breaking various personal, school, and conference records.
ROD MCCRAVY INVITATIONAL
Following the Beantown Invite, in which the women’s side came in first and the men placed third, the Crimson traveled to Kentucky for a less competitive event, albeit one which saw several Harvard runners record personal and school bests.
“It was a team meet in the sense that a lot of people went and a lot of people competed, but it wasn’t like a conference meet where you’re firing on all cylinders,” Kouba added.
Freshman Gabby Thomas took home the 200 meters title with a time of 23.44 seconds, a personal best and all-time best in the Harvard and Ivy League record books. The time also represents the best mark for freshman sprinters nationwide and the sixth-fastest in the country overall.
In the 60-meter dash, Thomas, set another personal best while placing sixth overall and recording the second-fastest time in Ivy League history.
“Thomas … came out and kind of annihilated the Ivy League 200 record,” Kouba said. “She’s just really phenomenally talented and is putting in the work to get even better.”
Sophomore Courtney Smith set a career-best in the 3000-meter run, crossing the line in 9:21.35, and winning the race by a comfortable margin of six seconds. Classmate Elianna Shwayder also posted a top-10 finish in the 3000 meters. The Ann Arbor, Mich. native came in eighth place with a time of 9:42.24.
“We’ve seen already through cross country that Courtney is definitely our top distance runner,” senior Emma Payne said.
Setting personal and league records was a theme at the Rod McCravy Memorial for Crimson runners.
In the 600-yard run, junior Jade Miller set a personal record with a time of 1:23.17. Payne finished runner-up in the 5000 meters with a personal best of 17:14.12, over 23 seconds faster than her previous top mark.
In the 4x400 relay, Miller, Thomas, senior Autumne Franklin, and junior Jackie Modesett came third, setting a school record with a time of 3:38.02, good for third-best in Ancient Eight history.
On the men’s side, freshman Myles Marshall set a Harvard indoor 800 meters record in his first collegiate 800-meter run. His time of 1:49.35 qualifies for second-best among freshman sprinters and 10th best in the country.
Sophomore Louis Colson placed fourth in the mile run with a time of 4:14.50. Freshman Kieran Tuntivate finished four spots later in the same event and set a personal best by crossing the line in 4:16.64.
In the field events, the Crimson continued the trend of top-10 finishes. Junior Julian Nunally finished ninth in the shot put with a throw of 16.60 meters. Fellow junior Josh Whitener placed 10th in the weight throw with a distance of 17.22 meters.
A pair of seniors posted top-10 results in the jumps. Spencer Lemons reached 1.94 meters in the high jump, earning the San Luis Obispo, Calif. resident a seventh-place finish. In the triple jump, Malcolm Mason Rodriguez placed sixth with a mark of 14.55 meters.
“There were some performances that were really stellar and some school records broken, and that’s always good to see, especially early in the season,” Captain Paige Kouba said. “There were also some areas that we have to improve on and work on going forward.”
JOE DONAHUE GAMES
Staying closer to home, the Crimson picked up even more top-10 results at the Joe Donahue Games at Northeastern.
On the track, junior Sylvia Deppen led the women with a pair of top-10 results in the 60 meter hurdles and the 200 meter dash with times of 8.86 and 25.54 seconds, respectively. Senior Chris Allen placed fifth in the mile run with a mark of 4:17.25, four seconds faster than his previous best.
In the field events, sophomore Lucia Alexander and junior Haley Baker finished eighth and ninth in the high jump and long jump with marks of 1.61 meters and 5.56 meters respectively. Freshman Nicole Trenchard and senior Lexie Schachne, meanwhile, finished fifth and sixth in the pole jump, respectively.
Freshman Ian West and junior Andrew Roney chipped in with top-10 finishes of their own, clearing marks of 4.80 meters in the pole vault to finish sixth and seventh overall, respectively.
With the results, Harvard track and field appears to already be in good shape looking forward despite it being so early in the season.
“It’s still pretty early in the season, so it’s really exciting to see all these [runners] getting after it,” Payne said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend at the Colby Carnival in Waterville, ME., a Harvard women’s Nordic skier claimed a top-10 finish for the first time since 2013. Junior Rachel Hampton overcame the particularly challenging, hilly course to clock in a 52:07.9 finish, for a career-high ninth place of 87.
“It’s been a lot of hard work, and this course is very, very tough. I think I just went into it and skied tough,” Hampton said.
Dartmouth ultimately took first place of the 16 teams at the end of the weekend, and the Harvard Nordic and alpine team placed 10th for the second week in a row.
“That was a pretty solid finish,” junior co-captain Kaitlyn Gibson said, “We managed those really good course conditions and hard snow and put it together well.”
While the rest of the Northeast felt the blow of Winter Storm Jonas, the Crimson took advantage of the unusually clear, sunny skies and firm snow, showing strong performances from both the men’s and women’s sides.
Sophomore Pieter Weemaes and senior Simon Merryweather qualified for second runs three races in a row, both improving significantly between their first and second runs. In the giant slalom, Merryweather jumped from 84th place in the first run to 53rd, while Weemaes improved from 74th to 52nd. In the slalom, Merryweather advanced from 77th to 38th, and Weemaes from 82nd to 41st.
“There was some really fantastic skiing from Simon on a really difficult course,” Gibson said. “A lot of skiers were not able to finish that course…. but Simon was super in control and really solid, and I couldn’t see any mistakes from him.”
In the men’s team sprint, junior Devlin Shea and sophomore Haakon Sigurslid eked into the top 20 at 19th place, while sophomore Connor Green and co-captain Soren Anderson followed at 33rd.
Harvard’s top three finishers for the 15K classic were Ian Meyer at 35th of 85 with 44:55.9, Green with 46:19.4 at 52nd and Shea at 58th.
In the women’s 15K, the team’s first mass start classic race, Hampton was followed by seniors Hanna Barnes at 23rd place with 53:08.8 and Annie Harvieux at 32nd place.
“It was longer than some of our freshmen had done and it’d been a while since the rest of us had done a long race like that, so it was really exciting,” Hampton said. “Our women’s team did a really great job of getting out, getting into position, and competing the whole time.”
The duo of Hampton and Harvieux led for the Crimson team in the women’s team sprint, finishing at 22:04.7 for 15th place. Freshman Nina Armstrong and Barnes finished shortly after in 20th place with 22:12.7.
In both the women’s giant slalom and slalom races, three out of four skiers qualified for second runs. Sophomore Kelly Steeves claimed first for Harvard in the giant slalom in 27th place at 2:14.57, followed by Molly Leavens with 2:20.49 at 40th and Gibson with 2:34.45.
“[Steeves] was consistently getting in the top 30s as well last year, so it’s really good to see some consistency on her end,” Gibson said.
Steeves and Gibson both qualified for the second run in the slalom race with exceptionally good times, but only Gibson managed to finish the second run. The Alberta native clocked in at 38th.
“We did really well in the first run but we made mistakes in the second run which cost Kelly to not finish and impacted my time as well,” Gibson said.
The seasoned alpine skier remained optimistic, however.
“The race was a really promising thing to build onto for the race next week, and it gave us a little bit of confidence. I think we’re in a much better position right now than we were a week ago,” she said.
After suffering from a lack of practices due to unusually low levels of snow, the team has felt improvement from the better snow conditions.
“Hopefully these extra inches that we just got will allow us to get on to more terrain, and that will be a lot more fun and challenging for us,” Hampton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One after the other, they took that final stroke and stretched their upper bodies to touch the wall as quickly as possible. One after the other, racers came up for air only to see the familiar faces of teammates greeting them in the neighboring lanes, as Harvard men’s swimming swept a number of races this past weekend in Las Vegas.
Buoyed by one-two-three finishes in four separate events, the Crimson (8-0) raced past Air Force (14-1) and UNLV (0-7) on Saturday in its final meet of winter break. This contest also marked Harvard’s final non-conference challenge of the season as it turns its focus to completing the Ivy League portion of its schedule now. The Crimson edged the Falcons, 163-132, while beating the Runnin’ Rebels, 188-105.
Freshman Danny Tran, an Irvine, Calif. native, was part of three races that ended with a Harvard 1-2-3, finishing ahead of two teammates in the 200 backstroke and 200 individual medley while claiming third behind two Harvard swimmers in the 200 freestyle. Tran has now won the 200 backstroke against seven different schools across four dual meets in his short collegiate career.
Fellow freshman Logan Houck continued his dominance of the long-distance freestyle events, winning both the 500 and 1000-yard races. With the opportunity to race in front of his friends and family in his hometown of Las Vegas, Houck edged out Harvard teammates in both events, with the Crimson claiming second and third behind him.
Sophomore Kent Haeffner came in second in the 1000 free while finishing third in the 500-yard event, while another freshman, Brennan Novak, claimed second in the 500. Novak also won the 200 freestyle, completing a successful day for Harvard’s freshmen.
Sophomore Ed Kim brought home second place in a couple events, finishing runner-up in the 200 free behind Novak and the 100 free behind Air Force’s Jordan Dahle. The Sammamish, Wash. native followed up his second place finish in the 50 free against Brown and Penn last week with a strong display this weekend.
The Crimson got off to a perfect start in the diving events, with sophomore David Pfeifer continuing his strong start to the campaign with wins in both the one-meter and three-meter contests. A former four-time state champion, Pfeifer won the one-meter event with 304.25 points, four ahead of the Falcons’ Nathanael Zillweger.
Pfeifer then recorded a more comfortable win in the three-meter event, with 27.8 points separating him and Zillweger at the top. Harvard sophomore Bobby Ross finished third, 51.35 points off the pace.
The meet was decided by the 15th event, with Harvard’s swimmers then swimming exhibition for the 200 IM and 400 freestyle relay.

With the match on a knife edge, the No. 32 Harvard men’s tennis team (3-1) needed hard-fought individual victories to have any hope of picking up the win, and that’s exactly what they got.
Buoyed by a strong doubles performance, the Crimson overcame its first loss of the season with a bounce back win on Sunday over No. 39 San Diego State (3-2) in Fort Worth, Texas. It won the contest, 5-3, in the consolation match of the ITA Kick Off tournament, hosted by Texas Christian University.
Harvard won both of the finished doubles matches, which marked the difference on the day. The Crimson and Aztecs split the six singles matches with three wins apiece.
Junior Sebastian Beltrame had a successful afternoon, registering the aforementioned comeback victory in his singles match before partnering with sophomore Kenny Tao to defeat San Diego State’s Milen Ianakiev and Marko Goles-Babic, 6-1, in doubles.
In his singles match, Beltrame dropped the first set, 4-6, to Ianakiev before responding in a big way, taking the second set, 6-1. With Ianakiev on the back foot, the Florida native kept his foot on the gas with a 6-3 victory in the deciding third set to improve to 2-1 in singles duals this season. He and Tao then compounded Ianakiev’s problems with a straightforward doubles victory.
Harvard’s next tight singles victory was achieved by sophomore Grant Solomon, who also fell in the first set, 4-6, to Aztecs freshman Cornelius Kolb. The Dallas product then found himself down, 1-4, in the second set, one break away from defeat. He righted the ship, however, winning the next five games to flip the momentum and claim victory in the second set, 6-4. Solomon finished Kolb off in the final set, 6-3, to boost the Crimson’s hopes.
Freshman Andy Zhou had a more comfortable singles win, defeating opponent Jonas Meinzer, 6-2, 6-2. The straight sets victory marked Harvard’s third victory on the day and Zhou’s third victory out of three completed dual singles matches this season.
The other three singles matches went to San Diego State, knotting up the match. Senior Nicky Hu, playing in the No. 1 position, fell to fellow senior Freddy Gelbrich. After winning the first set, 6-3, the Palo Alto native lost the next two, 3-6, 3-6. Junior Brian Yeung and Tao both lost tough matches in straight sets.
The match-clinching victory came from the doubles team of seniors Kelvin Lam and Conor Haughey, whose early breaks were erased during the course of the set. Being two experienced players, however, they overcame the setbacks with a 7-6 win, giving the Crimson its fifth and final victory necessary to close the match out.
The doubles match involving the duo of Yeung and Hu remained unfinished once Harvard secured the overall match win; they were down, 5-6, but preparing to serve for the tie.
