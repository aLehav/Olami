After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Scientists can express their complex works in understandable and interesting terms using the same techniques that are used on public radio, NPR correspondent David S. Kestenbaum said in a lecture Friday night.
Kestenbaum, currently a co-host of NPR’s “Planet Money” project, was the keynote speaker for ComSciCon-local, a two-day workshop designed to improve scholarly communication skills. He earned his Ph.D. in particle physics at Harvard in 1996 before becoming a science reporter for NPR, a transition that he said he made only after his girlfriend broke up with him for a writer.
Following an introduction from Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching Director Erin Driver-Linn and Kestenbaum’s former mentor and current Physics Department chair Melissa Franklin, Kestenbaum took the stage to explain “How to Tell a Story in Four Minutes” to an audience of more than 300 scientists and students gathered in the Geological Lecture Hall.
Kestenbaum kicked off his presentation by playing a clip in which Nobel Prize-winning physicist Anthony J. Legget attempted to explain his contribution to the scientific community.
 
“Well, the citation is for the theoretical work I did in connection with the new phases of liquid helium-3, which were discovered experimentally in the early seventies,” Legget said in a slightly muted British accent.
 
After Legget began listing the names of past scientists who contributed to his discovery, Kestenbaum cut off the clip, lauding the Nobel Prize winner for his humility but noting that such lengthy answers made his job as Legget’s interviewer more difficult.
Drawing on his experience as both an academic and radio correspondent, Kestenbaum then offered suggestions on how to improve the communication of scientific researchm.
“Ask yourself, ‘Do I really have a story?’” he said. “If the answer to this is not yes, then do not go forward.”
When a storyteller, whether a scientist or a radio correspondent, finds a compelling story, he said, he or she must figure out how to structure it. One tactic that Kestenbaum and his “Planet Money” co-workers occasionally practice is what he called “participatory investigative journalism,” in which a reporter becomes a part of the story he or she is telling. 
For example, in March 2010, when reporting on the aftermath of the housing crisis, Kestenbaum said he and his co-reporter Chana Joffe-Walt spent a thousand dollars out of pocket to buy a “toxic asset,” a collection of home mortgages, mostly from people who were given loans they were ultimately unable to pay back.
They tracked the status of this asset on the show as mortgage payments backing it began to come in to illustrate the complicated trajectory of troubled mortgages across the country. When the toxic asset ultimately “died,” they had only made back slightly under half their investment.
“The original government plan was to buy all these [toxic assets] up,” Kestenbaum said. “[Our experience] explains why that was such a dicey proposition.”
In the talk, which lasted a little under an hour, he discussed other methods for structuring and editing stories. Kestenbaum urged the audience to resist the temptation to avoid silence when interviewing guests, a technique he said he picked up for live radio. 
“Silence,” he said, followed by a brief dramatic pause. “Silence is really good. When there’s silence, it means someone’s thinking. It means something exciting or interesting is happening. Don’t fill silence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team may not have had its cleanest game on the ice on Saturday, but the squad’s defensive performance helped the Crimson skate clear past Rensselaer.
Harvard (16-2-2, 12-2-1 ECAC) never trailed in its second game in as many nights, finishing off a weekend sweep by defeating RPI (10-13-2, 6-7-1), 3-1, at the Bright-Landry Center.
“The second period was pretty ugly with four penalties, I believe, on us,” Crimson coach Maura Crowell said. “And that makes it tough to put the puck in the net when you’re down a man, down by two, at times. I was happy that we came out in the third period ready to go [and got] the go-ahead goal.”
Sophomore forward Miye D’Oench’s empty netter from behind the blue line with 37 seconds remaining in the contest all but guaranteed the win for Harvard—its seventh in its last eight games. The team’s lone blip in that span came against rival Yale.
“That empty net goal really sealed it off,” Crowell said. “[The team’s performance was] a good effort, but I think we have had better.”
COOLING DOWN THE ENGINE[ERS]
The Engineers had been offensively proficient as of late before meeting Harvard on Saturday. RPI had averaged three goals in its last seven games en route to a 4-2-1 record. But the defense and sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer slowed down the Engineers, only allowing one goal on 31 shots to help lead the Crimson to the victory.
“Emerance today made some huge saves along the way,” Crowell said. “They had some Grade-A chances that she found a way to get a piece of. She played really well.”
Maschmeyer almost notched a shutout, which would have been the first against RPI this year. She managed to get a piece of junior forward Ali Svoboda’s shot from the middle of the offensive zone in the third period, but it was not enough, as the puck trickled past her outstretched arm.
“I’m sure she’ll want that one back,” Crowell said.
THE PENALTY KILL
Despite six power plays for RPI on the day—including a prolonged 5-on-3 chance—the Crimson allowed no goals on the Engineers’ man-up chances.  Overall this season, Harvard has experienced similar success on the penalty kill. Despite being the second highest penalized team in the ECAC with 70 penalties on the year, the Crimson has only allowed one goal down a player on the ice. The team’s lone concession on the penalty kill came in a 3-2 win against Northeastern.
“We certainly don’t want to get this many penalties,” Crowell said. “We’re very confident in our [penalty] kill. I think we try to feel out the games and the referees, and try to play within the rules. [There were] some tough calls on us [but we] found a way to get it done.”
Such a strong penalty kill has aided the defensive effort of Harvard this year. Harvard leads the ECAC in goals against average with 1.14 on the season.
“We stress being very disciplined on the penalty kill,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “I thought that we were very good on that…. [We were] disciplined and didn’t let RPI create too much, so we were happy.”
OUTSHOT BUT NOT OUTPERFOMED
RPI registered 10 more shots than Harvard on Saturday, but the Crimson notched two more goals than the Engineers to emerge victorious. Such has been the trend of the season thus far for the Cambridge residents. While Harvard has recorded 359 shots on the year, opponents have registered 393.
But the discrepancy is not evident in the team’s record. Despite being seventh in the ECAC in shots, the Crimson ranks third in the conference with 2.86 goals per game.
THE GOLDEN CROWE
Hillary Crowe added to her impressive offensive performances of late, notching two goals in the contest, including the game winner in the third period.
“The first one was an excellent feed by [defenseman Sarah Edney] and I was in a great spot,” Crowe said. “The second one was a great line effort…. I had the whole net effort.”
The junior has recorded five goals in her last four games .
“She’s on a roll,” Crowell said. “She’s a huge part of our offense right now. She’s in the zone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team is a fan of the third period. After clawing its way back from deficits against Colgate and the University of Connecticut, the Crimson followed a similar script against Union on Friday night.
Harvard (15-2-2, 11-2-1 ECAC) came away with a 2-0 win against the Dutchmen (8-16-1, 3-10-0) after notching two goals in the final period.
While the Crimson seemed to control the puck for the majority of the game and outshot the visitors through two periods, 16 to eight, Harvard went into the last 20 minutes tied, 0-0.
“We’ve been in a lot of tight situations like this throughout the season,” coach Maura Crowell said. “I think we have a lot of confidence with it now, so I just told them to stay calm and be confident, know when to shoot, know when to pass, and don’t panic. I think they did a really good job with that while maintaining their intensity level, which is what you want.”
It only took 46 seconds of the final period for Harvard junior forward Hillary Crowe to convert captain defenseman Marissa Gedman’s shot attempt into the first goal of the game. While Gedman’s shot was stopped by Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg, Crowe lunged for the rebound and managed to flick the puck into the back of the net.
“We had been creating opportunities all night,” Crowe said. “But nothing was really clicking and we weren’t finding the back of the net. We just needed to crash the net and make the goalie move laterally because she was coming up huge and we were shooting right into her. Once we finally popped [the first goal] in, it gave us the momentum we needed.”
After Friday night’s matchup, Gedman had accumulated a total of five assists and three goals for the season. Crowe tallied her eighth goal of the year, making her one of the team’s top scorers.
Freshman goaltender Brianna Laing made 15 saves for her third shutout in four career starts. Both the Crimson and the Dutchmen went scoreless on their two and three power plays, respectively. However, while Harvard shot twice during its power plays—both tries stopped by Lundberg—Union had three shot attempts on the advantage, but was shut out by Laing
“I thought we kind of had a slow start,” Crowe said. “I thought we came alive in the third period, which is good because we’ve been focusing on playing a solid sixty minutes. When it’s a tied game, we want to play with a sense of urgency. Coming off of a solid weekend we wanted to carry over a lot of things that we did well, like moving the puck well up the ice, and just playing fast and smart.”
The Union team has a strong defensive line, along with goaltender Lundberg, who has a save percentage of .900 and has blocked a total of 586 shot attempts. Dutchmen forwards Stefanie Thomson and Kathryn Tomaselli lead their squad’s offense, with eight and 11 goals, respectively.
“[Union’s] goaltending is very strong,” Crowell said. “Their power play is very good. I think they’re fifth in the country in power play, and they have the leading scorer in the country with power play goals, so we definitely keyed in on that. They battle hard, so that’s what we were ready for.”
Junior defenseman Sarah Edney slapped a shot into the high corner of the net late into the final period to make the score 2-0, nabbing her fifth goal of the season in the process. The assist came from Gedman.
The Crimson outshot the Dutchmen, 24-15, while Union won 20 of the 38 faceoffs.
“[We want to] play hard for 60 minutes,” Crowell said. “That’s always what we try to do. We had a really exciting win last weekend over Cornell and we want to sort of springboard from that into the rest of the season, so that’s what we did and I think this was a really great game for us.”
The win against Union is Harvard’s sixth win in seven games. The Crimson also notched its ninth home game victory of the season.
“From here on out it’s just a race to the playoffs,” Crowell said. “Every game matters, and that’s all the motivation that [the team] needs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Maksim Korolev set a Harvard record this school year when he placed third at the NCAA Cross Country Championships in November, the highest finish of any Harvard runner. When he crossed the finish line at Friday’s Terrier Invitational at Boston University, he broke yet another Harvard record.
Korolev’s 5K time was among the fastest of all Division I athletes this season and eclipsed a mark set almost two decades ago.
A day earlier, the Crimson women’s 4x400 relay group had broken another school record, capping off a solid two days for both Harvard squads.
On the women’s side, freshman Jade Miller set the pace for the Crimson with a 54.8 second split in the first leg of the 4x400, and her three teammates followed her lead. Junior Erika Veidis and freshman Jackie Modesett sprinted the middle two legs, and junior Gabrielle Scott blew away the rest of the field with a 53.7 time to wrap up the record breaking performance.
“We all got goosebumps watching [Scott] close like a train on the anchor leg, really chasing down the first place girl and getting her at the line to get the victory,” Veidis said. “It bodes well for rest of the indoor season and even going into outdoors.”
The foursome’s time broke a Harvard record that had stood since 1999.
“It’s really exciting [to break the school record],” Veidis said. “I think the most exciting part is that it’s the first 4x4 that we’ve run with that lineup…. We’re going to continue to do even more damage over the next couple of weeks and hopefully heading into nationals, too.”
Scott built on her relay performance with a third place finish in the 400-meter dash, coming in at 54.48, less than a second behind the winner. Veidis managed to top her teammate’s finish, breaking out to an early lead in the 800 and never looking back. Crossing the line at 2:05.55, the Sparta, N.J. native beat Ivy League foe Megan Krumpoch of Dartmouth by less than a second. Sophomore Kieran Gallagher finished third in the second heat and 10th overall in the same event.
“That was a really good race for me,” Veidis said. “It was my fastest indoor and second fastest lifetime including outdoor…. I was pretty much running from the front for all of it, and I was able to stay relaxed and smooth.”
The Crimson came away with another first and 10th place finish later in the day, this time in the 1000. Freshman Sarah Gillespie opened up a lead heading to the finish, and clocked in at 2:51.95, while sophomore Paige Kouba finished in 10th at 2:59.95.
Among the other top Harvard finishers were junior Molly Renfer, who finished ninth in the mile run, and classmate Viviana Hanley, who finished 11th in the longest event of the day, the 5000. Junior Ann Giebelhaus and freshman Raegan Nizdil tied for fourth in the high jump after both cleared the 1.65-meter bar.
The men’s team had similar success.
It’s not too often you see a time in the 5000 that starts with 13 for the minutes place, especially not at an invitational so early in the season. But after running cross country during the fall, Korolev is arguably still at peak form. He put that on full display on Saturday with a 13:42.56 finish, 35 seconds ahead of his nearest competitor and almost 17 seconds ahead of the previous Harvard record time held by Killian Lonergan ’97.
The Crimson had solid showings in the 200 and 3000 events, with senior Damani Wilson taking 14th with a time of 21.85 in the fourth heat of the former and sophomore Thomas Purnell finishing 10th in the latter at 8:05.58 in the first heat. The men’s 4x400 quartet completed the event with a time of 3:17.07, a pace good enough for ninth place.
“I thought the 4x400 was a big highlight because we had two teams go right around 3:20…with the B team all the way down at 3:21,” Wilson said. “We have probably about 10 guys who can do 50 [seconds] or better, so we have a lot of guys to choose from come Heps.”
In the field events, junior Ben Glauser came in fourth in the shot put, compiling a distance of 17.33m (56-10.25), while freshman Andrew Roney took ninth in the pole vault with a distance of 4.70 (15-05.00).
“Coaches are still figuring out who’s going to do what event, [and] who’s going to do what relay or what jumps,” Wilson said. “For right now, I think the most important thing is figuring out what exactly [each team member] thinks would be [his] best contribution to the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Rensselaer provided an early-season shock to the Harvard women’s ice hockey team, the Crimson was ready to redeem the first loss of the season in its rematch against the Engineers in front of a home crowd.
The Crimson (16-2-2, 12-2-1 ECAC) faced RPI (10-13-2, 6-7-1) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday night and found redemption with a win, 3-1.
“I think we played a physical game,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “We really fore-checked well and kept them pinned in their zone which I think created a lot of opportunities offensively for us, so that was huge.”
After a scoreless second period, Harvard found an offensive opening when junior forward Samantha Reber passed the puck to sophomore forward Miye D’Oench, who then waited for Crowe to position herself on the left side of the crease for the goal. Crowe slid past a RPI defender to beat the goaltender and connect with the back of the net.
“Anytime you can get a little bit more of a cushion, it helps,” coach Maura Crowell said. “[The second goal] rejuvenated the bench and the confidence went up from there. It was a tight game. RPI is a good team, and they play hard. They have some dangerous weapons up front and they showed that and stifled us for quite a while.”
Crowe’s goal widened the lead to two, 3-1, for Harvard. Crowe also tallied her tenth goal of the season, and second of the game.
Harvard sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer had 30 total saves through the contest, compared to RPI goalie Kelly O’Brien, who had 18 saves. The Engineers outshot the Crimson, 31-21, but Maschmeyer turned aside almost all of their attempts. Maschmeyer’s save percentage is now at .956, with 455 total saves this season.
“We were supporting each other really well,” junior defenseman Sarah Edney said. “Especially behind the net and in neutral zone. Our goalies have been supporting our defense well and talking to us on the defensive end.”
15 seconds after Harvard scored its second goal of the game, Rensselaer responded with a try from junior forward Ali Svoboda. Svoboda slapped a shot through the Crimson defense, and while Maschmeyer had her glove on the puck, it managed to slide barely past the goal line to make the score 2-1 halfway through the closing frame.
Despite coming away with the win, Harvard encountered difficulty at the face-off circle, capturing 15 compared to the Engineers’ 26 face-off victories.
And while four power play opportunities present themselves through the second period, the middle 20 minutes saw no action inside the net. There were also the most total shot attempts during this period—19 between the two teams—even though none were converted.
The slow second half of the first period and entire second period were preceded by Crowe’s first goal of the game. Edney intercepted an RPI pass and sent the puck up to her teammate, who patiently waited for the opportunity to slip it to the back of the net, past O’Brien. Edney has had eight other assists this season, second only to Reber.
Harvard’s total penalties shot up to six by the third period. During the second period, the Engineers were given with a 3-on-5 advantage but were unable to convert against the Crimson’s penalty kill. In fact, both Harvard and RPI went 0-for-2 and 0-for-6, respectively, on power plays.
“I think that especially as the second game of the weekend we really came together as a team,” Edney said. “Our penalty kills were solid two-minute kills, which was a really strong part of our game.”
In an effort to score a quick goal to tie the game, the Engineers pulled their goalie with a minute left, creating an opportunity for the Crimson when sophomore forward Mary Parker forced a turnover. Using the pass from senior defenseman Elizabeth Parker, D’Oench skated up the blueline to score the second empty netter in four games with 37 seconds left on the clock. The third Harvard goal secured the win, 3-1. D’Oench’s goal was her 11th this season, making her the leading scorer on the Crimson’s side.
With the win against RPI, the Harvard women’s hockey team retains ownership of first place in the ECAC, three points ahead of runner-up Clarkson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H. – Following a loss, the Harvard men’s basketball team (15-3, 2-0 Ivy) has a simple saying: regroup and respond.
A game after the worst shooting performance of Crimson coach Tommy Amaker’s tenure, the squad issued an authoritative response with an 80-50 victory over Dartmouth (7-9, 0-2) on the road—the team’s largest road victory of the season. After struggling offensively early, the team shot 79 percent in the second half and 66 percent for the game—its best shooting performance under Amaker.
Co-captain Laurent Rivard, who led the team with 15 points, said that, after the defeat to the Owls, the priority was not letting a single loss turn into a string of defeats.
“Coach said he was disappointed in the way we played and the effort that we gave [against FAU],” Rivard said. “We needed to make sure we didn’t play that way again and let that turn into a slide or a big slump. You see other teams—Wisconsin, Ohio State—dropping one game and it turns into four.… We didn’t want that happening to us.”
On the defensive end, the Crimson shut down a Big Green attack that was missing its key cog. With junior forward Gabas Maldunas, who had 23 points when the teams met a week ago, out for the season with a foot injury, Harvard held Dartmouth to 20 first half points and just 38 percent shooting for the game.
“Defense is our number one priority,” co-captain Brandyn Curry said. “Even when our shots aren’t falling, our defense should be there. I was happy with our effort out there tonight.”
Through eight minutes of play, however, the team had continued the mistakes that plagued it against Florida Atlantic last Tuesday. The Crimson missed four of its first six shots from the field and had nearly as many turnovers—five—as field goal attempts.
Enter Curry.
After a layup by sophomore wing Agunwa Okolie, Curry took over. Following a loose ball foul on the Big Green, Curry crossed over his mark at the top of the key and laid the ball up among three defenders. The senior picked off the ensuing inbounds pass and laid it up in one motion. After another Dartmouth turnover, Curry took advantage of a screen from junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi, knocking down a three-pointer to put the Crimson up by double digits. Curry and Harvard did not look back, taking a 37-20 lead into the break.
Curry finished with 14 points, one of four Crimson players in double digits on the night. After the win, Amaker called the team’s bench—which outscored its Dartmouth counterpart, 28-10—and its balance two of the squad’s most important strengths.
“[That run] was critical for us because we talk about how we can be a tough team to scout or defend because we have a couple different individuals who can step up,” Amaker said. “Whether it is Agunwa at Fordham, whether it is Brandyn down at Rice, we have had a number of different guys absolutely carry us and set things up for us in a positive way.”
The Big Green stayed in the game due to the efforts of sophomores Connor Boehm and Malik Gill. The pair combined for 17 of the team’s 20 points in the first half, making eight of 11 field goals as the rest of the team combined to make just one of 13. After Harvard took a 21-6 lead, Boehm and Gill were responsible for seven points in a 9-0 Dartmouth run to draw within six.
In the second half, however, the Crimson quickly did away with any hopes the Big Green may have had of a comeback. Harvard moved the lead to 24 in two minutes and opened up a 32-point lead with eight minutes to go, with Okolie and Moundou-Missi combining for four straight dunks.
In the final period, along with shooting 79 percent from the field, the Crimson made all six of its threes and all seven of its free throws. Each Harvard player to attempt at least two shots connected at fifty percent or better from the field, and for the game the team shot 71 percent from three.
After the win, Amaker stressed the importance of taking care of business on the road.
“The veteran players in our locker room, they recognize that every game is critical,” Amaker said. “Every team in every conference thinks like that, but we have no postseason tournament. Our older guys who have won this league three years in a row, and the younger guys are following their lead. I am very pleased to see that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s squash team endured several tight matches against St. Lawrence Saturday night, but it was the match between top-ranked Ali Farag and the Saints’ Amr Khalifa that stole the show, as the senior found himself face-to-face with the opponent that eliminated him from the last year’s CSA Individual Championships. Anchored by Farag’s victory over Khalifa, the No. 2 Crimson (8-0, 3-0 Ivy) clinched the victory, 8-1, over St. Lawrence (8-2).
“I’m really happy with it,” Farag said. “We beat the No. 4 team in the country, and I think that sends a message to the entire squash world that we are working really hard and that everyone on the team is contributing.”
Last year’s loss to Khalifa in the semifinal of the CSA Individual Championships was Farag’s first collegiate defeat, and the veteran set out to avenge the showing on the glass courts at the Murr Center. Despite an early deficit, Farag rallied back, seizing control of the match and refusing to hand over the reins from that point onward, taking down Khalifa in straight sets, 11-4, 11-5, and 11-7.
“We’ve played together for years, so we know each other really well, and I think it showed today on the courts,” Farag said. “I think that the player who’s stronger mentally has the advantage in the match, and today I think I had that edge, which made the difference for me.”
The rest of the Crimson team followed suit, as the squad toppled the Saints to preserve its undefeated record.
“Going in we felt it could have gone either way,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “I don’t often say this, but our guys were fantastic today. They were really, really solid.”
One of these solid performances came from junior Tyler Olson. Olson beat his opponent in three straight games, each of which was a hard-fought contest. After jumping out to an initial lead, Olson lost momentum and had to climb out of an early hole. Every game saw Olson falling behind at some point, but the junior managed to battle back each time, eventually claiming the match, 13-11, 11-8, and 11-9.
Senior Tom Mullaney also gave a strong effort, coming back from a 4-0 deficit in the first game to regain the lead and win his match in straight games, 11-8, 11-3, and 11-3.
Freshman Bryan Koh had to fight in a similar fashion to bring home the win. After dropping the first game, the rookie claimed the second and third. The Saints' sixth seed, Sebastian Riedelsheimer, took the fourth game, sending the match into a fifth round.
“I think I did a good job of staying in the game,” Bryan Koh said. “It was really tough mentally, but I’m really happy I was able to overcome it and walk away with the win.”
The match featured several tough rallies and a neck-and-neck pace that kept the freshman and his opponent at a close margin the entire match. Koh emerged victorious, 9-11, 11-7, 11-7, 8-11, and 11-7.
“Bryan’s opponent was really gritty,” Way added. “It got physical at times. He had to hold his head up to come out in the fifth for the win.”
St. Lawrence handed the Crimson its first dropped match of the season, as Brandon McLaughlin fell at the No. 2 spot. The Saints' Moustafa Bayoumy defeated the senior in straight sets, 11-9, 13-11, and 11-6.
Although the Crimson saw itself facing some of its tightest matches since the season started, the team still managed to keep its undefeated record intact.
“We were still able to win, in spite of not all playing at our best, which I think says a lot,” Farag said. “It shows how strong everyone is on this team…. Even when we have a bad day, we can still fight for the win.”
Other wins for Harvard came from freshman Dylan Murray, sophomore Nicholas Hopcroft, and seniors Gary Power and Nigel Koh, all of whom maintained undefeated personal records with the day’s wins.
With a flawless season record to uphold, the Crimson looks to continue its streak in the coming weeks to solidify a top bid at nationals.
“The whole team, the whole attitude, what our captains are doing, it’s all fantastic,” Way said. “It was nice to see us go about our business today, and give such a solid performance.”

After falling behind at the midway mark, the Harvard wrestling team battled back to win over its cross-river rivals. The Crimson (3-4) lost an initial lead over Boston University (3-7) but scrambled back to take the Charles Cup, 23-15, at the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday night.
“This is a big win for us as a team,” junior James Fox said. “BU always comes in and wrestles us really tough for the Charles Cup. We knew it would be a really close match and that it would come down to bonus points at the end.”
One of the standout performances of the night came from Fox at the 197 lb weight class. The junior recorded a fall against BU’s Kristian Meyer to put the Crimson firmly in the lead, 20-15.
“I told him he had to go out and get points for us,” coach Jay Weiss said. “When you have leaders trying to do something bigger for the sake of the team, things happen like that. He hasn’t wrestled like that all year, and you could see that it was starting to click for him.”
Fox had narrowly missed notching a similar fall in his recent match against Cornell, making the performance all the more meaningful for the two-time NCAA qualifier.
“It was electrifying,” Fox said. “I was able to get into a good position and put him on his back to get the pin.... It was just awesome.”
After a three-match losing streak put Harvard in an early hole, the team started to turn the tables when freshman Eric Morris notched a major decision over BU senior Eric Des Lauriers in the 174 lb weight class to draw the Crimson within five points.
“After losing some of those weights down lower, we knew we were going to need bonus points,” Fox said. “So we knew going into the 74, 84, [and] 97 that we had to do our best. The mentality was that we had to go after those guys and get points for the team to anchor the win.”
Brennan Smith stepped up into the lineup at the 165 lb division after an injury benched Harvard’s expected wrestler. The sophomore took junior Mitchell Wightman into triple overtime before falling, 2-1.
“[Smith] wrestled really well for us,” Fox said. “Even though he lost, he kept us close, didn’t give up any bonus points, and got us really fired up as a team.”
Freshman Tyler Grimaldi also provided a strong effort that did not fully translate to the scoreboard with a 16-6 loss to No. 8-ranked Nestor Taffur in the 157 lb division. After an initial takedown by Taffur, Grimaldi was able to battle back before the BU senior registered the takedown.
Following Eric Morris’s victory, the Crimson seized on the momentum from Fox’s fall and did not drop a match the rest of the contest, holding BU to 15.
Captain Cameron Croy notched five takedowns to register a major decision against junior Andrew Maksimovic in the 184 lb division. In the heavyweight division, Harvard sophomore Nicholas Gadzjik and Terrier senior Kevin Innis provided the closest match of the day. After bringing the match score to a 1-1 tie, Gadzjik seized the momentum, escaping a single leg grab by Innis to notch a 3-1 victory, and solidify Harvard’s win, 23-15.
“Nick lost to [Innis] last year,” Fox said. “So it was awesome to see him come out this year and beat him, and really show everyone that he’s made some great strides as a wrestler.”
This win for the Crimson marks the end of a two game losing streak for the squad. Weiss was pleased with the effort across the board.
“From top to bottom our guys wrestled hard tonight, whether they won or lost,” Weiss said. “They wrestled as a team tonight, and it really reinforced what we’ve been telling them.... Tonight showed that it’s all really starting to click for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Saturday’s contest at Murr Athletic Center, the Harvard women’s squash team looked to continue its perfect season. The Crimson (7-0, 3-0 Ivy) sat its top four players for the matchup against St. Lawrence (2-6), but despite some fresh faces in the lineup, Harvard still managed to come away with a perfect 9-0 win.
“Going into the game, we wanted to practice what we’ve been working on and get off as efficiently as possible,” junior co-captain Haley Mendez said. “People had their game plan going in, and they knew what they needed to practice for some of the tougher matches in the next ten days, so this was a great warm-up match for us.”
Eight of the nine wins were won in three straight games. The lone game loss came in the battle of the No. 1 seeds, as Crimson sophomore Michelle Gemmell faced off against fellow Canadian Jillian Baker.
Gemmell, playing for the first time in Harvard’s top position, suffered a loss in the second frame, as Baker came back from an 11-1 loss to claim a 12-10 victory and square the match. Gemmell won the next game, 11-7, then picked up an 11-5 victory to come away with the hard-fought 3-1 win for the Crimson.
“Michelle was playing number one, and she’s usually number four, so she really stepped up,” sophomore Isabelle Dowling said. “She had to make adjustments in her game after the second game, and the fourth game was really great to watch.”
For some of Harvard’s younger players, this was the first time their games were counted in securing the Crimson’s victory.
Freshman Caroline Monrad played as the sixth seed and won her match against Valerie Quan, 11-3, 11-1, and 11-2. Classmate Keegan Mendez notched a win against Sarah Neilson at No. 7 with an 11-6, 11-3, and 11-1 victory.
“At the bottom of the ladder, we had a couple people who don’t normally play but played in the top nine in this match, which was awesome,” Dowling said. “They were all great, and really stepped it up. It can be tough sometimes stepping into a role when your match counts when it normally doesn’t, but they all did it beautifully.”
Co-captain Natasha Anzik played in the No. 8 spot, topping St. Lawrence’s Carolyn Fisher in three straight games, 11-4, 11-3, and 11-1.
“It was relatively straightforward for us,” Mendez said. “We’ve been training really hard over J-term, so it was nice to see that pay off. Natasha played at the eighth position and had a great win. It was really nice for her to have that happen in one of her last home matches.”
Higher on the ladder, Dowling and freshman Dileas MacGowan still stand undefeated in individual matches this season with seven apiece. MacGowan won her match against the Saints’ No. 3 seed Emily Terry, 11-4, 11-5, and 11-2. Dowling bested opponent Zoe Kagan, 11-5, 11-4, and 11-6, at No. 4.
“The girl that I played from St. Lawrence was definitely solid,” Dowling said. “It was great to go out there and tweak some things that I have wanted to work on from my past matches.”
The 9-0 victory marked the Crimson’s fifth shutout this season.
“I think everyone played well,” Dowling said. “They were kind of working out the parts of their game that needed to be worked on throughout the season. I think we all wanted to go into this as one last match to get the experience under our belt before we tackle next week, which is going to be a big challenge.”
Harvard has been consistently strong since the beginning of its 2013-14 campaign. The Crimson hopes to carry the momentum into the weekend, when it faces off against Penn and Princeton in a pair of critical Ancient Eight matchups.
“First and foremost, we’re trying to stay injury-free,” Mendez said. “We know we’re fit, and we know we’ve put the work in, so now it’s just consistency and making sure everybody shows up with their A-games every match. Everybody has the little things that they need to do to feel like they’re playing well, and right now it’s just about staying confident and playing our game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a successful fall season, the Harvard men’s tennis team fell twice in its spring opener against top-flight competition at the ITA Kickoff Weekend tournament this weekend.
The ITA season-opening festivities included four-team tournaments at 15 campus sites around the country. The Crimson’s draw included host No. 13 Mississippi State, which knocked Harvard out of last year’s NCAA Tournament in the second round, No. 21 Memphis, and No. 18 South Carolina.
The No. 26 Crimson fell to Mississippi State on Saturday, 4-3. The loss prevented Harvard from reaching the championship match for a chance to advance to the ITA National Team Indoor Championship in February. Then, in Sunday’s consolation match against the Gamecocks, Harvard fell behind quickly and lost, 4-0.
But the team is satisfied with the way it played, especially given the stage of the season, according to Harvard coach Dave Fish.
“This was really our first set of matches of the spring season,” Fish said. “There are things we’ll know later in the season that we don’t know at this point. We played two really fine matches this weekend.”
South Carolina 4, Harvard 0
After Memphis upset South Carolina in the teams’ opening-round matchup, the Gamecocks and Crimson met in the consolation round. But fourth-seeded Harvard could not keep up with second-seeded South Carolina, and the Crimson left the weekend winless.
In doubles, the No. 17 doubles tandem of senior Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen trounced No. 24 Chip Cox and Kyle Koch, 6-2, but the other two doubles matches did not go Harvard’s way. No. 48 sophomore Nicky Hu and freshman Brian Yeung fell, 6-3, on court two, and freshman Sebastian Beltrame and sophomore Kelvin Lam lost in a tiebreak, 6-5(3), to give the Gamecocks the doubles point.
In singles, the Crimson could not turn the match around. Freshman Andrew Ball lost on the sixth court, 6-5(2), 6-1, and Beltrame came up short at the third position, 6-3, 6-5(4). After junior Alex Steinroeder fell on court five in three sets, South Carolina had clinched a quick 4-0 victory, even though Harvard led in the remaining matches.
“We came back strong today after a slow start,” Fish said. “That’s the sad thing about this clinch format. It quite possibly would’ve been a 4-3 match, and instead it looks like we didn’t do anything.”
Mississippi State 4, Harvard 3
In last season’s NCAA Tournament, the Crimson came up well short against the Bulldogs, falling 4-1. On Saturday, Harvard played a much closer match against top-seeded Mississippi State, which needed a third-set comeback to win.
The day started off well for the Crimson, with MacMaster and Nguyen continuing their winning ways in a 6-4 triumph. Hu and Yeung pulled out a 6-2 victory to give Harvard the doubles point.
But the Bulldogs turned it around from there, taking two straight-set victories to take a 2-1 lead. Hu fell on the sixth court, 6-1, 6-5(4), and junior Shaun Chaudhuri lost to No. 39 Mississippi State senior Malte Strop, 6-3, 6-2, on court two.
After Beltrame lost a three-setter, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, the Crimson trailed, 3-1. But Harvard quickly stormed back as Ball won in three sets at the fifth position and No. 44 Nguyen beat No. 63 Florian Lakat, 6-5(5), 6-2.
It all came down to the fourth court, where the match was in the third set by the time the rest had finished. Steinroeder led Bulldog senior Zach White, 3-2 and 40-15, in the deciding set, but White rallied to take the game. He wouldn’t drop another, and came away with a 6-4, 5-6(1), 6-3 win.
It was a disappointing end to the day, but things are looking up for the Crimson, which is looking to claim its third straight Ivy League title this season.
In its singles lineup, the team is already starting three freshmen, who will look to be serious contributors this season.
“It’s very unusual to have three freshmen start this early, especially on a team that is already so solid,” Fish said. “But these guys are good, and they’re definitely going to help us in singles and doubles.”
Facing top competition early will help the team better prepare for the spring season, according to Steinroeder.
“We are disappointed in the results from the weekend, but proud of the way we competed and fought against two very strong teams in both matches,” he said. “We will use it as a learning tool and use the lessons from the weekend to get better for the rest of the season.”
