After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators removed the last vestiges of the Occupy Harvard encampment from Harvard Yard on Friday afternoon. Administrators and Cambridge police cited potential safety hazards as reason to dismantle the weather-proof dome and information tent—the only structures remaining since the protest movement decamped in December.
On its website, Occupy Harvard called administrators’ decision to dismantle the dome “a direct reversal of their previously stated commitment to ensure free speech in Harvard Yard.”
Jeff Neal, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson, said that safety was the impetus behind the seizure of the dome and information tent.
On Friday, winds reaching 45 miles per hour caused the dome to move several feet and collapsed the tent, Neal said in an email, adding that the dome nearly struck a passerby as it started to careen across the Yard.
Derin Korman, a teaching fellow in Visual and Environmental Studies and Occupy Harvard supporter, said that he and other protesters removed the tarp covering the dome after the structure fell.  Protesters then transported the tarp and the other loose objects  kept in the dome to Phillips Brooks House for storage.
On its website, the Occupy Harvard group stated that protesters understood from a conversation with a grounds manager that they could keep the dome in the Yard as long as it was secured. They held an emergency general assembly in which they made plans to affix the dome to the ground.
But Director of Facilities Management and Operations Zachary M. Gingo and Associate Dean for Physical Resources and Planning Michael N. Lichten then approached the protesters and told them to remove the dome, Korman said.
When the protesters refused, Harvard employees disassembled and seized the dome. On its website, Occupy Harvard claimed that the workers were assisted by Cambridge police.
On that same day, the University had received a letter from the Cambridge Historical Commission claiming that the geodesic dome’s presence put Harvard in violation of a code forbidding structures erected on a historical site without a permit. A University official declined to comment on whether the letter influenced Harvard’s decision to remove the dome.
Neither Gingo nor Lichten could be reached for comment.
Neal wrote that the University will return the pieces of the dome once Occupy Harvard representatives make arrangements to retrieve them. Harvard has forbidden the protesters from erecting the dome on University property again, he said, but administrators plan to work with the protesters to find a new location for their information table.
With or without a physical occupation in the Yard, members of the movement said they will continue to make their presence known on campus.
“We are still here,” Korman said. “We will continue in various forms. It is definitely not the end, not nearly so.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: JAN. 23, 2012
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article implied that Occupy Harvard protesters, including teaching fellow Derin Korman, were in the group’s information tent at the time their geodesic dome was uprooted by wind. In fact, Korman was in the Yard at the time and does not know whether anyone was in the tent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a hard-fought contest that featured one of the best matchups of the early season, No. 3 Princeton narrowly defeated the No. 5 Harvard men's squash team, 5-4, before a sizeable crowd at the Murr Center on Sunday afternoon.
This one went down to the wire, but the Crimson (10-1, 2-1 Ivy) finally had its record streak of eight straight 9-0 sweeps broken by an undefeated Tiger squad (8-0, 3-0).
Initially falling to a 4-1 deficit, the Harvard squad climbed back to knot the score at four but eventually lost the final match, as Princeton’s Dylan Ward defeated Crimson junior Zeke Scherl at the No. 7 spot, 3-1.
“I think right now the team is gutted,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “But as [sophomore] Gary [Power] just said to the team, they got to remember this and come back and work harder. But what a match, you can’t take away from Princeton. They were awesome, and they were better than us today.”
The No. 1 spot featured a close battle between last year’s College Squash Association Individual Champion, Princeton junior Todd Harrity, and the 2010 Junior World Champion, Harvard sophomore Ali Farag. With the overall match on the line, Farag came back from a 2-1 deficit to defeat his Tiger foe, 3-2.
According to Way, Farag told him that it was “the toughest match of his life. Not just the physical but the mental [part] of the fight and the noise of the gallery.”
Throughout the match, Farag often found himself clawing back from an early deficit in each individual game. In only his second match for the Crimson, Farag is still adjusting to the tense atmosphere of Ivy League squash.
“I think this weekend he felt the weight and felt that he was carrying the team,” Way said. “So he put a lot of pressure of himself, and when you do that you fatigue prematurely. … For Ali, it was like welcome to college squash.”
But Farag was able to come back, finding momentum in the fourth game after falling early. The sophomore won the game, 11-6, after losing a tight 13-11 battle in the third game. He carried the momentum into the fifth, winning fairly easily, 11-4.
“My plan didn’t work so I had to find another plan to play, and fortunately it worked,” Farag said.
The Crimson fell early with 3-0 losses by sophomores Brandon McLaughlin and Gary Power at the No. 2 and 3 spots, respectively. Junior Alexander Ma lost 3-1 at No. 9, winning the first game handily, 11-2, but then losing the next three to his Princeton opponent.
Sophomore Nigel Koh lost a back-and-forth battle at the No. 4 spot, 3-2, to Tiger Samuel Kang, who according to Way had never defeated Koh. The two had played each numerous times while both growing up in Singapore.
Down 3-1 after a close 11-8 loss in game three, Koh held off his opponent on match point in game four and eventually won, 12-10. But fatigue seemed to set in during the fifth game, as Koh lost 11-6, putting the Crimson in a 4-1 hole.
In Harvard’s comeback bid, freshman Julian Kirby at No. 8 won the decisive fifth game after initially going ahead, 2-0. In that final game, Kirby had gone up 8-4, but then the Tiger David Harrington tied the score at eight. But Kirby overcame the late surge, winning, 11-8.
At No. 4 for Harvard, freshman Nicholas Hopcroft won in straight sets soon after Farag’s victory, keeping the Crimson’s comeback hopes alive.
Early in the day, freshman Tyler Olson contributed a 3-1 victory after initially dropping his first game, meaning that with both squads tied at four wins apiece, the outcome of the match came down to the battle at the No. 7 spot.
Scherl won the opening game, 13-11. Ward took the next, 11-6.
The third game was tense, with each point eliciting a loud response from the crowd. Ward jumped to an 8-4 lead, but Scherl battled back with strong play. In the end, Ward was able to take the game, 13-11, and the momentum, finally defeating Scherl in the fourth, 11-8.
“The guys that lost fought to the absolute bitter end,” Way said. “They will review the mental and tactical aspects on this, but you can’t fault anyone. No one threw the towel in. No one capitulated.”
Harvard will try to use the experience gleaned from this near-upset in hopes of capturing an even larger one next weekend, when the Crimson will aim to snap Trinity’s 13-year and intercollegiate varsity sport record 252-game winning streak next weekend in Hartford.
“It was a really tough battle,” Farag said. “I am a little disappointed that we lost, but it’s going to raise our game heading into next weekend.”

Venezuelan restaurant Orinoco, which has locations in the South End and Brookline, opened its third eatery in Harvard Square last week. Although the restaurant is officially open for business, the owners will continue to iron out kinks in the system up until the restaurants' grand opening which is scheduled for the end of January.
The space, previously occupied by Spanish restaurant Small Plates, has undergone a series of renovations, now offering patrons a cozy atmosphere with Latin flair. The owners chose to decorate with family pictures and warm tones to create an environment that mirrors the décor of their other two Boston locations, manager Martha T. Garcia said. However, only this location features an outdoor terrace which will open later in the season.
Since opening, locals have frequented the restaurant, although Garcia said that business has been slow, citing that students are not currently on campus. Located at 56 JFK Street, Orinoco offers moderately priced dishes for both students and locals. Closed on Mondays, Orinoco will serve lunch, dinner and weekend brunch Tuesday through Sunday.
So as we all return to Cambridge in the coming week, here's another potential dining option for when the d-hall just isn't cutting it.
