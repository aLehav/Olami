After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eager to capitalize on the spirit of Halloween, students of all years had queued up to experience the “Quincy Haunted House,” and the size of the queue was the first scare of the night. Friends cracked jokes, Snapchatted, and played slide while attempting to ward off the mounting anxiety. Shrieks, expletives, and the periodic roar of a chainsaw emanated from the closed doors of the course, reminding those waiting in line what lay in store. After some waiting (and a group of five shamelessly cutting us), we arrived at the front of the line.
Garrett M. Wen ’18 opened the door and grinned, welcoming his next three victims to the scariest two minutes and 14 seconds of their lives. Wen—with his menacing, sadistic grin—was the impetus for the Quincy Haunted House, but for unexpected reasons.
“Garrett gets scared very easily, so over the last year, we’d hide in key areas of his room. And when Garrett would get in, we wouldn’t even have to say ‘WAH!’ We’d just say ‘Hey Garrett’ and he’d go “AHHH!’” said Max Y. Hsiao ’18, Wen’s roommate.
After a particularly good scare on Wen, Hsiao and his roommates came up with an idea. “Yo why don’t we scare people in our house? Wen had experience running a haunted house, so why don’t we do this here?” said Hsiao.
And now, their idea had become a reality. A reality that became all too clear when Wen shut the door, handed me the flashlight, and told me that his roommates had gone missing, and I needed to find them. The flashlight made the terrifying scenery all too clear. A chilling soundtrack underscored bloody sheets, shadows lurking just out of view, and a labyrinth of narrow walkways obscured in darkness. The set did not at all look like a room in Quincy’s basement. For all intents and purposes, it was a haunted asylum brimming with masked monsters.
What separates this haunted house from all others? Wen and Hsiao’s unyielding determination to disorient. For the duration of the course the same three masked men relentlessly jump out, attacking from the sides, in front and behind. There is never a safe second in this maze. The knowledge that a peer in a mask is inevitably waiting at the next turn, or perhaps is directly behind, serves as no protection when the moment arises.
Wen and Hsiao clearly love what they’re doing. They’re not bored teenagers in it for a few bucks. They took the time and care to create a truly terrifying environment, and on top of that, put on a spectacular show. Every jump scare was a leap, every “boo” is a “BOO!,” and every single second is made both enjoyable and utterly frightening. Wen could have easily strung together a few bloodied bedsheets and called it a day. But he and his roommates committed to creating not just a novelty, but an experience. I have yet to hear of one student who was not properly spooked by Wen’s haunted house (though contrarians, please do speak up).
This year, Halloween fell in the middle of the week. But in the face of a potentially bland and banal holiday, one suite put its collective foot down. With time and love, Wen and suite created a truly superb haunted house, one that was the highlight of Harvard’s Halloween season. May this haunted house outstay Wen’s four years, and deservedly enter the pantheon of wonderful Harvard traditions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 11, 2017 at 1:57 a.m.
Three of my close friends walked into the Public Service Recruiting Day event last week, hosted by the Office of Career Services, Center for Public Interest Careers, Institute of Politics, and Philip Brooks House Association. They expected to be met with eager staffers excited to talk with them about their resumes. Finally, they thought, Harvard is connecting us to jobs that can make the world a better place. Instead, the event was mostly informational, as many groups did not have concrete positions open or hadn’t started taking applications yet.
After minimal substantive interaction with recruiters, my friends listened to awkward speeches from Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Public Service Gene Corbin, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and William D. Delahunt, a former U.S. Representative for Massachusetts, that parroted the insecurities that have turned many a Social Studies concentrator into a McKinsey recruit: There is no money, few jobs, and little glamour working for the government or a non-profit. Casting a pallor over the entire event was the paranoid reassurance from speakers that those who do public service can always return to the private sector and make boatloads of money if (or when) they want. My friends left feeling dejected; apparently, doing a public service job after college required them to become as saintly as Franciscan friars, preaching good while simultaneously begging for food.
At Harvard, 51 percent of the Class of 2017 who joined the workforce after graduation took jobs in the consulting, finance, and technology industries. Yet, when the Class of 2017 was surveyed as incoming freshmen, only 20.1 percent said they planned to work in consulting, finance, or technology immediately after graduation. What happened in those four years that turned so many students towards these fields? The obvious answer is recruiting, but Harvard’s “sell-out” culture prods even the most civic-minded towards corporate America.
From the insufficient number of summer fellowships and meager funding for internships, to the lack of a centralized resource for public service career services, and finally to the unstructured, unpredictable, and late-term process of applying for jobs, pursuing a public service career requires grit, tenacity, and boundless confidence in your chosen career path. Contrast this with the highly streamlined recruiting and exorbitant benefit packages dangled in front of kids who still belt along to rap at dorm parties. For seniors being coaxed by a silver platter of options from proactive private sector firms, the anxiety to get a job as quickly and painlessly as possible often leads to corporate capitulation. And combined with the reassuring structure of recruitment, the job security represented by a Bain office in a Manhattan skyscraper usually trumps the unsexy idealism of an unkempt nonprofit office in Lansing.
Such a desolate job landscape in public service is exacerbated by a belittling and dismissive attitude from Harvard administrators. At a reception after the Public Service Recruiting Day, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana cracked a joke to a room full of humanities and social science students about his daughter’s interest in humanities, confiding that he hopes that she gets a high-paying job so that she doesn’t end up living in his basement after graduation. On Tuesday, the Institute of Politics hosted an event on “leveraging private sector experience for success in the public sector,” but two out of the three panelists had followed the opposite path, switching from public sector employment to the Boston Consulting Group and Harvard Business School. Harvard does not only neglect to provide public service opportunities for its students; its employees are also often caught making a mockery of Harvard’s service-oriented mission to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.”
Beyond the administration—or possibly because of it—the student body also sniffs its nose at public servants, especially those not in the Capitol or White House. Telling friends that I worked in a state senator’s office last summer elicits an unenthusiastic response at best, and a sympathetic one at worse. My friends interning at hedge funds and finance firms joshed with me about having to take the Greyhound bus to visit them in New York, instead of a more comfortable Acela express train. Teasing—both from Dean Khurana and students—would be perfectly fine if it did not represent such a sore spot for so many insecure students. While sacrificing money might be a given in public service, there is no reason why prestige or recognition must also be given up. According to its mission, Harvard and its students should hold public service in high esteem, yet its institutions and culture continue to make it the butt of jokes.
Most appalling of all is seeing the students who most wanted to dedicate themselves to service after graduation trade their activist aspirations for Wall Street. As a Social Studies concentrator, I have several friends in Government and Social Studies who I have heard have taken a consulting or finance offer. While some of these friends come from a lower-income background and justify their change of heart in terms of financial subsistence, most others simply found taking the job to be more expedient than undergoing the demoralizing process of casting out resumes to dozens of nonprofits while their roommates rest secure in the job offers they received months ago.
Each year, around 1,600 starry-eyed freshmen enter Harvard’s gates, expecting to be given the tools and resources to change the world for the better. If Harvard is to keep its promise to “educate the... citizen-leaders” of the world, a paradigm shift is needed. Paraphrasing Barack Obama, we, as students, need to “make government and public service cool again.”
But such a culture change will require investment from the Harvard administration to ensure that students aren’t left to fend for themselves in the vicious tug-of-war for Harvard talent between the Googles and Morgan Stanleys of the world. For those who do it, “selling out” should be a carefully considered and whole-hearted choice, not a tragic surrender.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 11, 2017
A previous version of this article misstated the percentage of the Class of 2017 entering consulting, finance, or technology after graduation. Fifty-one percent of those members of the Class of 2017 who are entering the workforce are entering one of those industries, not 51 percent of the entire class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences issued its first large-scale opinion on the sanctions Tuesday, with the defeat via paper ballot of the motion introduced by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 motion to not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for membership in “any lawful organization.” The failure of this motion is the largest barometer yet of faculty opinion on the administration’s policies regarding unrecognized student groups, and ought to be read as support for the administration.
Especially because faculty governance is so important, much can be interpreted from this vote, as it was the first of its kind that fully measured faculty support in the year and a half since the first social organization policy was implemented. Of course, voting for or against the Lewis motion is not equal to an up-or-down vote on the social group policy itself. The motion has limitations and nuances that could constitute barriers to fully using it as a benchmark to gauge Faculty opinion.
In this light, the College cannot sit content on its laurels, having achieved a first show of faculty support. The debate over the Lewis motion highlights the many tensions between the College’s commitments to needs of inclusion and belonging as well as upholding the right to freely associate in our society. The College must consider these issues further, thinking and finding ways to reconcile them fully as the debate over its social group policies continues.
Regardless of the limitations of the Lewis motion, or the inevitably continuing discussion of the social group policies, we appreciate the decision to finally put the motion to a vote, and we hope to see greater expediency on matters like this in the future. After the long history of Lewis’s proposal, we are glad to see the Faculty make its collective opinion clear, and hope the College will contemplate this when considering future policies.
While the defeat of the Lewis motion ends one dimension of the debate over the College’s policies, the future of unrecognized social groups at Harvard is far from certain. Existing policies influence the Class of 2021, and proposed ones may affect future classes. The role and actions of the final clubs and other social organizations have changed drastically over the last few decades, and any policies will end up shaping their future character and their influence on student life. It is imperative that the administration and faculty devise a solution that will be beneficial to Harvard and its values.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard shuttle and I have a love-hate relationship. Actually, it’s more of a hate-hate relationship. Whenever I need the shuttle, it’s never there; whenever I don’t need it, somehow there are three idling right in front of Pforzheimer House. (I’m convinced it’s a conspiracy.)
And thus, I am inevitably forced to always make the three-quarter-mile, uphill-both-ways trek from the hinterlands of the Quad down to the Yard. I can count on my hands the number of times I’ve taken the shuttle this term, and it’s always been by luck rather than design. (And it seems to be axiomatic that every time I’m arriving at Pfoho on foot, out of nowhere, the shuttle appears.)
I could go on about the shuttle and my quixotic journey to one day catch it from Widener Gate, should it ever appear there. But I’ve learned to appreciate much more about the campus we live on, something I wouldn’t have realized had I taken the shuttle every day.
---
Autumn came early this year. The first few weeks of the term were much cooler than usual—a welcome change from my home state: sun-kissed, arid, ash-stained California. And with the sudden drop in temperature came an equally precipitous golden cascade of leaves, silently floating off the dying trees, coming to rest on the worn reds of the brick sidewalks.
I have never taken these leaves for granted. I’ve always been an incurable romantic—as an eight-year-old, I’d attempt to gather the pitiful amount of leaves in my front yard in order to make a pile to jump in, knowing full well it’d never work.
“You’re far too old to jump in leaves,” I tell myself now, but some part of me knows I’ll eventually do it soon. (And the more childlike I appear, the better.)
Autumn is a time of introspection for me. I used to take long walks down the Charles River last year, mulling over my transition 3,000 miles across the continent to Cambridge. The river became a comforting constant, as I would sit, watch, imagine, journal. My camera roll has stored photos of the river at nearly every point during my first year, reflecting its transition from liquid to ice, from sailing season to spring.
When I was sorted into Pforzheimer House, the potential loss of the river disturbed me. But I quickly realized, upon moving north, that there was an entirely other side to Cambridge I’d never fully explored, in the day-to-day tumult of my everyday routine. And it’s so incredibly beautiful, especially as the fall has wrought its magical changes. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana loves to talk of the “transformative experiences” Harvard holds in store, but nothing is more transformative than for me, a city kid born and bred in a La La Land of endless summer, to witness the wonder and spectacle of a New England autumn.
I have lost count of the number of times I have wandered through Cambridge’s neighborhoods, losing myself in endless cul-de-sacs or winding side streets, feeling the biting chill of early morning or late afternoon on my cheeks, and finding peace within myself. The scenery is perfect; the autumn makes Cambridge seem Edenic.
My mind has continuously gone over all the books, poems, and lyrics I have ever read that express the beauty of autumn, trying to describe it. My words fall short of those which have been said by greater, more talented writers. My camera holds ever more photos, but the snapshots of the river that characterized last year have been overtaken by photos of treetops, houses, and lonely, winding streets.
---
Harvard can only be described as magical, regardless of its everyday issues and struggles (like the perpetually errant shuttle). But its joys are not without their stresses and pressures. Perpetual concerns about life after college, summer internships and opportunities, and schoolwork all serve as a burden, forcing us to look long-term and plan our schedules in byzantine, maximum-efficiency ways. Why take the 15 minutes to walk to the Yard when you can get there on the shuttle in less time (ideally) and get some work done on it, too?
I won’t say we should give up the shuttle entirely, especially Quadlings. The Shuttle might completely disappear (more than it already does). And this isn’t to say all students completely ignore autumn. Many students regularly go on outings, exploring Massachusetts and New England. But overall, Harvard lapses us into routine, and we ignore its uniqueness.
Most evenings, I trace the shuttle’s path on foot through Cambridge Common to the Quad. It is a canvas of reds and golds everywhere: not merely spread out against the sky, but in the treetops as well. The glint of the dying sun reflects off of the statue of Lincoln in the center of the Common and bounces off my glasses, temporarily blinding me. I turn and feel a leaf graze my cheek, muted to a red that more closely resembles the brick underfoot than the green of the tree it came from.
I would never notice this if I missed the opportunity to take a different route home every day and make time to “stand and stare” at the world, as the poet William Davies wrote. It’s the little moments, little discoveries that make me realize I am somewhere magical.
I hope we all take the time to realize this, to stand and stare, as the autumn transitions to winter. Because that’s what makes Harvard the magical place it is.

This month, I celebrated the one-year anniversary of submitting my application to Harvard by throwing myself into an even more competitive applicant pool—one that’s way more open about personal hygiene.
I applied to donate my poop through a givepoop.org online form.
OpenBiome, based in Somerville, is the world’s first nonprofit stool bank. Their donor applications are open to everyone living in the greater Boston area—including people like me, a fresh-faced college student, eager to make $40 each time I defecate into a blue plastic Tupperware-like container that looks like it could hold Cool Whip.
If accepted, I’d take the T to their labs in Central Square, the closest donation center to Harvard, at least three times per week. I’d either donate on-site in one of their luxurious bathrooms, or poop in my dorm and rush the sample—that’s what they call it—to Central right afterward. The sample would then be transferred to a plastic filter bag, homogenized with cryopreservatives and a saline/glycerol solution, and packaged in dry ice, to prevent unsightly leakage during shipment. The final product is an opaque, silky liquid somewhere between dark and medium roast in color, packaged into bottles that look like smaller versions of Clover Food Lab’s ready-made coffee.
The poop that OpenBiome collects is used for Fecal Microbiota Transplants. They’re a tremendously effective—80 to 90 percent effective, in fact—treatment for Clostridium difficile, a hospital-acquired bacterial infection for which 20 percent of patients suffer recurring symptoms despite antibiotic use. Fecal transplants are also used in clinical trials, such as for Crohn’s disease.
Tom B. Leith ’16, Clinical Research Associate II at OpenBiome, emphasizes the growing popularity and success of fecal transplant procedures. “Even just a few years ago, there were just a couple thousand FMTs done in the United States. But we’ve shipped almost 30,000 treatments in the last couple years,” he says. “Making an impact on patients’ lives very rapidly is a cool part of working here.”
Last year, OpenBiome expanded their main office to the fifth floor at 200 Inner Belt Road in Somerville. They share the unassuming brick building with Finch Therapeutics, a company that handles OpenBiome’s manufacturing processes and works closely with them to collect and process the stool, and—bizarrely enough—with offices for Harvard Art Museums. My phone automatically connects to Harvard Secure as the elevator ascends.
OpenBiome’s offices are sunny, with open cubicles and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer panoramic views of Boston. The walls in the office are plastered with images of what, in any other office, might pass as decadent swirls of chocolate soft-serve ice cream: a mustachioed cartoon poop with glasses and a hat reading “Pooper Trooper”; a picture of everyone’s favorite crop top-clad bear captioned “Winnie the Poo.” The rooms are named after parts of the intestine: The Ileum is the name for the Biobank room, and the door to The Fundus is lined with poop emojis. A bug-eyed, poop-shaped balloon bobs above a cubicle.
Pooping is a part of life everywhere, but I get the sense that here, it’s a lifestyle.
Pratik K. Panchal, a graduate of the School of Public Health and a Clinical Research Fellow at OpenBiome, has worked in three different countries and says that OpenBiome has “the best work culture [he’s] ever seen… You talk about poop every day to someone new.” He smiles and shrugs as if to say: What more could you want?
I was convinced. OpenBiome, however, was less impressed by me. My pooper profile was rejected in the second round after I admitted to a little flirtation with antibiotics. It was one time, okay? But it turns out that the medication could still interfere with the bacteria in my gut. OpenBiome requires donors not to have taken antibiotics within the last three months, just to be safe. I was bitter at first—donors can make up to $13,000 a year!—but I get it. Poops have to be perfect.
With its 2.8 percent acceptance rate, OpenBiome is almost twice as selective as Harvard College. You might make it through the initial evaluation—a short survey, a 200-question form, and a clinical visit—safe in the belief that your poop is a solid 10, but you might find out through the subsequent blood and stool analyses that your bacteria could harm, not help, the recipient.
Anyone can still apply to be a donor. If you think your gastrointestinal tract has what it takes—if you really, truly believe that your shit doesn’t stink—go forth and pick up where I left off, or even where more successful applicants have left off. The single largest donation to OpenBiome weighed half a kilogram, after all. Consider that a challenge.
As for me, I have to wait three months for the antibiotics to get flushed out of my system before I can apply again. Maybe that’s not a bad thing: I don’t know if I could spare the time or energy. I’m pretty pooped already.

“Close your eyes. What’s your first memory of food?”
Indigenous chef and activist Neftalí Durán poses this question to the 160 attendees of the Ivy Native Council Fall Summit, gathered in Boylston Hall. At the summit, Native American students from Ivy League colleges convene over issues facing indigenous people today. This fall, the issue on the table is “Indigenous Food in the 21st Century.”
The crowd is quiet until one student near the front speaks: “I remember smoking fish, and you can smell the smoke coming out of the smokehouse. It’s always the little ones who put enough salt in the water to make the potato float.”
Food might seem like an unusually specific topic to focus on, and it is. Past summits have mainly tackled wider questions of sovereignty. But Native Americans at Harvard College, the group that organized the Summit, has found that food impacts the lives of indigenous people in broader, weightier ways than most people are aware of.
“Everybody knows that indigenous people have been tormented for 400 plus years, and I think that food sovereignty and similar issues are other ways that indigenous people are still being oppressed,” says Noah D. Cominsky ’20, who is Ojibwe, from the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the social chair of NAHC. “People don’t necessarily realize that yeah, there’s the Dakota Access Pipeline, but there’s [also] this issue that people don’t really know about.”
As one speaker would later address, the issue of food access is deeply tied to high-profile water and energy conflicts like the one that sparked the 2016 protests at Standing Rock.
“Food has been used as a weapon against indigenous people for a very long time,” says Elizabeth M. Hoover, an assistant professor of American Studies at Brown University descended from Micmac and Mohawk communities in Upstate New York and Eastern Canada.
Energy disputes often threaten food supplies on Native land. One Minnesota pipeline was diverted from the south of the state “because that’s where all the people live,” says Hoover. Instead, the pipeline was planned to be constructed in the north, across tribal lands containing rice crops.
“It’s: ‘Here there be dragons and Indians,’” Hoover says. “What happens if and when these pipelines leak into these very sensitive wild rice beds?”
A few years ago, Hoover embarked on a 20,000 mile drive around the country, documenting 40 indigenous food projects. The project aimed to promote access to sufficient, healthy, sustainable food by reclaiming traditional diets.
Traditional diets tend to be healthy and plant-based, which could be a step to address the diabetes epidemic facing Native Americans. Eating traditional foods is also a way to sustain elements of language and culture that might otherwise be erased.
But the barriers to transforming Native diets are many. Eating historically can be expensive, and heritage plants can be nearly impossible to recover in non-native environments.
“There’s a history of resiliency of indigenous people in the kitchen,” says Duran, who teaches indigenous culinary tradition. “If you know how to make a tortilla, if you know how to grow anything, if you know how to smoke your fish, that’s… a remnant of survival against all odds.”
An oft-repeated question at the Summit: “What about the frybread?” Some Native chefs refuse to serve frybread because it was originally made using commodity ingredients imposed onto displaced Apache and Navajo people. Others embrace it, viewing it as a symbol of resourcefulness. Besides, it has become a staple of tribal cuisines—for many, it is a reminder of home.
And the Summit more broadly attempts to create a sense of home: Establishing community is central to its purpose. Many attendees either grew up in the same tribal communities or met during Ivy League pre-college recruitment trips. Each Ivy Native Council event is an opportunity to reunite.
Ashley N. Hamilton ’20, vice president of NAHC, is enrolled in the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska, though her mom is from the Kickapoo tribe in Kansas. She says one of her goals is to “Help [students] go through the difficulties of being a Native student at an institution that wasn’t made for them.”
“Harvard has a spot for us,” Cominsky says. “And we will always be working for that spot. We call Harvard home. We call each other home. And so we just want to be home.”

A group of students sporting Magic Marker mustaches, jerseys, and sweatpants run a last-minute rehearsal of a hip hop routine. Another group in heels and strappy-backed dresses teeter up and down the aisles of Adams dining hall, moving wooden chairs into rows. Performers clad in lamé and leather mingle with the audience, waiting with anticipation for the show to begin.
“This isn’t what you would imagine when you imagine Harvard,” Joel E. Kwartler ’18, this year’s emcee, says. ”And I think that’s a good thing for the spirit of the House.”
This is Adams Drag Night, an annual drag show organized by the Adams House Committee featuring student and faculty acts. While celebratory, its origins are somber: According to an email from the committee, in 1980, three students attacked a gay student from Adams in an act of hate. In response, Adams students organized a Drag Ball, attended by both gay and straight students in support of their peers.
Robert J. Kiely, Resident Dean of Adams House from 1973-1999, credits the event with increasing dialogue at Harvard. “In the seventies… a lot of subjects, including homosexuality, were just not discussed,” he says. “[Drag Night] opened up, in a friendly and bold way, a subject that had been kind of taboo, not just at Harvard but in general in our society.”
One by one, four basketball-wielding, baseball cap-clad performers take the stage to Charli XCX’s “Boys,” to seduce the object of their desire: a tall student in a red lace dress.
Not all performances opted for glamor. A medley from “Hamilton” featuring a tail-coated Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr waltzing to “Dear Theodosia” adds more somber touch to the otherwise risqué set.
“One of the most important things about [Drag Night] is that the [Resident Deans] do a performance every year,” Matthew J. Corriel ’05 says. A former resident of Adams House and Resident Tutor from 2007 to 2010, Corriel fondly recalls being a spectator at the event as an undergraduate, and a performer and songwriter as a tutor. “[The Deans] help nurture a certain spirit in the house by participating,” he says.
Resident Deans Judy S. Palfrey ’67 and Sean G. Palfrey ’67 first performed 19 years ago as Abigail and John Adams. This year, they jog up the aisles to the feel-good beat of “The Fighter,” by Keith Urban featuring Carrie Underwood. Judy Palfrey, jacketed and wearing a black skinny tie, lip-syncs the first verse. Her husband struts behind her, wiggling his hips in a form-hugging black dress with a cropped platinum-blonde wig atop his head. Their performance is charming: At least a month of preparation has gone into it.
Five years ago, the Palfreys performed as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. This year, two more Kermits take the stage. Scout Leonard ’18 and Tina Huang ’18, clad in menswear and green headscarves with large, white eyes pasted on top, sit on the edge of the stage and sway along to “The Rainbow Connection” from “The Muppet Movie,” before standing before the audience with a rainbow flag draped over their shoulders.
While scores of students enjoy Drag Night each year, many remain unaware of the history behind the event until they are told by others.
“I was very moved to hear about the origins of such a celebrated tradition. I just didn’t know. We loved it because of what it is,” Corriel said. “You can enjoy it without understanding the history, but like with all things, it’s so much better when you do.”

When, late at night, the moon clashes with Mars and the pull of the tide gets your girly business in a tizzy, all girls are thinking one thing: it’s five o’clock somewhere: namely in Los Angeles on November 3rd, when that burglar busted into Yasiel Puig’s house while he was at Dodgers Stadium losing to the Houston Astros in a devastating game seven of the World Series. Rough night! When the world gets you down, any bad betch knows how to put one back. Put the weight of the world behind you, I mean, and go for a long, head-clearing walk. But when you come back and get down to your normal evening of painting your nails, looking at pictures of horses, and playing solo Madden, or whatever stuff you girls do, you might want a nice estrogen-y cold one to slurp it all down with. If you’re looking for a classic femme drink, you’ve come to the right place.
Whisk-She Sour
1 1⁄2 oz bourbon
3⁄4 oz. fresh lemon juice (Lemonade is a good substitution!)
3⁄4 oz. simple syrup (1 part water, 1 part sugar)
3 cherries
1 lime wedge
1 drop pink food coloring
Rocks
You’re a girl, that means you like girl stuff. Why else would Gillette make pastel razors and hike the standard price by 20 percent? Two words: Lady. Business. Ever had a Whiskey Sour? Of course not, you’re a girl. But—you’re welcome!—here’s your chance. Nothing says girl more than a Whiskey Sour when you put pink in it. Swag on this, high heeled friends!
Jill and Coke
2 oz. Jack Daniels
10 oz. Coke
10 drops pink food coloring
Cocktail umbrella
Listen, sometimes the squad’s posted up on a Friday, internet shopping on your phones, doing p-sets on the fly or, like, showering. You know what I mean, the girl vibes. And you just want to pop one back with your ladies. Pink style. Here’s my pitch: a little Coca-Cola, a little Jack Daniels, one of those tiny umbrellas that makes you think, “Hey, what if there was a little guy so small he actually used this umbrella to stay dry? Unreal, that would be cute as hell.” We don’t want a guy drink, so throw in some pink stuff, and ladies, that’s a GNO.
Mos-Gal Mule
Half a lime
2 oz. vodka
4 oz. cold ginger beer
100 drops pink food coloring
Ice
My good man José Canseco once said, “The reason I am the way I am is that I know the secret of life. And the secret of life is this: You fall down. You get up. That's it. It doesn't get any simpler than that.” Right on, my man! That guy knew how to get juiced. Let’s chow down on some girl drinks, Canseco-style. This one’s a feminine twist on a classic. Ginger-lime. Ice. Pink. What else could you ask for? The Equal Rights Amendment hasn’t passed, but that’s lame anyway.

“It was a very good story. I thought and thought. I thought of a mini reading response in my head. I got a piece of lined paper and wrote. Some days I got tired and took a break. Other times, I wrote one or two pages. I’m still writing today, in fact.”
Jane Kamensky, the Director of the Schlesinger Library, studies how ideas and symbols move through populations over time. “I often tell this story about Copley’s painting of John Hancock, which was done in 1765. It’s one of the quartet of patriots that lines the big entry gallery to the Americas wing at the MFA.”
“I want my reader to really think about what I was thinking at the time. I want the reader to know about me.”
“Hancock is perched over a ledger,” Kamensky continues. “He’s portrayed as a young merchant. His uncle has died and he’s inherited this great fortune—that’s the occasion of the portrait. I joke that we have the tendency to look at it as though he’s sitting there in 1765 with this book and this pen practicing his signature for the Declaration of Independence eleven years later.”
“I want my reader to know exactly everything about all the details. To think exactly what I write. I want my reader to know everything.”

“I collect state quarters as a hobby. I’ve been collecting since I was five years old! I have a ton of quarters right now, but my goal is get all of them in my book around 2008 when the last quarter comes out. But until then, I’m searching for North Dakota, the latest quarter.”
Prior to the first day of third grade, we were instructed to decorate the outside of our Writer’s Notebooks with a collage of things we cared about. I cared about “BOOKS”, a bouquet of pansies, the Food Network logo, a bowl of fruit, a basket of fruit, two strawberries, a baby-grand piano, a packet of New! Mega M&Ms, “Nonfiction”, two grey-and-white ragdoll cats, and Hershey’s Extra Dark Chocolate. And, of course, the North Dakota state quarter.
“My objects are important to me and remind me of stories. The idea is that whenever I look at an object, right away, I remember the story that it reminds me of.”
Those objects on the cover of my Writer’s Notebook—that long list of trinkets that sounds more like a Mother’s Day wish-list than an eight-year-old’s favorite things—were the most accurate description of me. I imagine that there is a landfill somewhere that contains the neat stack of magazines from which I gutted each of the photographs that make up that collage. And I suppose that that months’ worth of “Cat Fancy” and “Better Homes and Gardens” forms the most accurate description of all that is not me. That my fledgling self is somehow a bunch of pictures taken from a foreground of nothing.
“It feels like I’m back when it happened. I can see the picture in my head.”
Writer’s Notebook, then, is nothing more than a catalog of things. My third grade self is captivated by playing cards and how to use them, by my brother’s dusty school projects under his bed and where to find them, by half-size double basses and when to tune them, and by Kindergarten shoelaces and how to tie them. The first essay I ever wrote, embezzled with Microsoft ClipArt and all of zero citations, is a list of things, too:
“Graphite has many uses. It is used in tennis racquets, fishing rods, and fire doors. Graphite is also used for brake shoes, electrodes, graphite powder, golf clubs, automobiles, and aircrafts. In addition, it is used in rocket engines, rocket nozzles, paint, and bricks.”

If Writer’s Notebook ever ends up in a museum some thousand years in the future, Senzer will become synonymous with Webster and Diderot. If you don’t know who those people are, it’s because you only know what they wrote about. After all, you use gimcrack and curios and baubles every day. And if you are unfamiliar with those words in the previous sentence, you should go and look them up in Webster’s dictionary. And if you don’t know what a ‘dictionary’ is, you should go and look it up in Diderot’s encyclopedia. But good luck finding any information about either of those two men in their respective books. Their names belong to objects, now.
Kamensky notes the difficulty of determining how one’s past identity translates to the present. “The person who wrote those documents does not know how their life turned out and does not know how the world turned out. When we’re dealing with the biographical questions of people becoming themselves and the question of confirmation bias and a self-fulfilling prophecy, we have to remember that people are making it up as they go along.”
As much as I want to, I can’t look at Ben’s Nobel Prize-winning treatise on graphite and claim that it planted the seed of his interest in chemistry today, because it didn’t. I can’t read “My SHINY Bass” and say that it inspired 11 years of Ben playing the double bass, because it didn’t. When I wrote about these things, they were exactly that—things. They were things I read about in “TIME for Kids” and “World Book.” They were things that were hanging up in the classroom on some stock poster ordered from an educator’s Christmas catalog. But they weren’t me, and they didn’t have anything to do with me. These penciled words, fossilized between frail, jaundiced composition book pages, are graphite.

“It’s not a category of thing. It’s a lens.” Kamensky gestures to her wall of textbooks. “If my question is what happened in such-and-such period of American history, then the textbook is a tertiary source, because it is a synthesis of the writings of other historians based on documents from the times they looked at.”
“One night, I got to stay up until 12:00 midnight. That’s when the ball would drop.”
“A research paper is, in some sense, a secondary source because the researcher reads other things to write it.”
“I looked at the time. It was 11:59. Only one more minute left… 60, 59, 58, until…”
“Certainly, at the point where any historian looked at [your writing], they would be primary sources. It could be any genre of source—diaries, letters, television shows, interviews, data sets, voting records, newspapers—but it is some kind of direct witness from the period of time you are talking about. That’s its primacy—its rootedness in time.”
“…5, 4, 3, 2… and this was it. The key to 2006. It was going in the lock and now it just got pulled out.”

Forty-seven men and 19 women dressed in business casual sit on boxes of film that reach from floor to ceiling. In the foreground, front and center, one man stands out: He looks like the kind of man who doesn’t have time to be there. He’s middle-aged, dark-haired, regarding the camera with familiarity.
The man is Edwin H. Land, pictured in the 1970s, when he was well into his career as the president of the wildly successful Polaroid Corporation. The photo, as well as approximately 1.5 million other Polaroid-related documents, resides in the Baker Library’s special collections, where Land left his company’s archive in its entirety after his death. By then, he had been recognized as a genius of his time, but his unorthodox trajectory began many years before, during his college days.
According to the Baker Library’s exhibit, “Polaroid: At the Intersection of Science and Art,” Land entered Harvard College in 1926, but like many innovators—Mark Zuckerberg, Robert Frost, Bill Gates—he left early. After just one semester, Land left Harvard to conduct research in New York City, where he first had the idea for synthetic polarizing material, which would eventually spark the development of Polaroid Co. He returned to Harvard in 1929, where he struck up a friendship with his physics professor, George W. Wheelwright III ’25.
Wheelwright was a dilettante: First a painter, then a sailor, then a summer camp founder, and then, briefly, a professor at Harvard. He taught Land and liked him, and wielded his influence to grant Land a lab of his own when Land was still an undergraduate. Under Wheelwright’s mentorship, in 1932 Land became the first Harvard undergraduate to lead a physics seminar, which he called “A New Polarizer for Light in the Form of an Extensive Synthetic Sheet.” Wheelwright was so impressed that he urged 23-year old Land to drop out that year and pursue a new physics project with him: Land-Wheelwright Laboratories, later renamed the Polaroid Corporation.
Land agreed and left Harvard for the second time, because he wanted to bring “to the world a wonderful and special way of solving problems,” as he stated in a lecture at MIT.
Land said in a 1976 interview with the Boston Globe that “nothing or nobody could stop me from carrying through the execution of an experiment.” This tenacity yielded more than 500 patents over the course of his life. Under his leadership, Polaroid Co. manufactured a staggering range of products from polarizing film and lamps to blackout windows and flight goggles—and its crown jewel, the polaroid camera.
Land, in his acceptance speech for the Charles Kettering Award in 1965, attributed the inspiration behind the polaroid camera to his daughter. He recalled “a sunny vacation day in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when my little daughter asked why she could not see at once the picture I had just taken of her. As I walked around that charming town I understood the task of solving the puzzle she had set me.”
Land understood the childhood fascination with optics, as he himself was interested in kaleidoscopes and stereoscopes as a young boy. In an interview with Time magazine, Land said, “To a child, a photograph gives a permanent thing that is both outside himself and part of himself.” His inventions and his influence on the optics industry were just that: long-lasting, far-reaching, and deeply personal.
The internal structure of the company was innovative, too. The employee body itself was unique for the early 1940s, as Land hired many women, often Smith College graduates, as high-level researchers. In a 1945 workplace satisfaction questionnaire, he described Polaroid Co. as a “company where work is fun, a company that exists primarily for the people in it.” Within the survey, he asked employees whether they saw their boss as “hard to talk to” or “just one of the boys,” and asked if they thought their work was getting “much more interesting,” “less interesting,” or “dull as dishwater.” The Polaroid archive—overflowing with black-and-white photos of employees smiling, playing basketball, singing together—speaks for itself.
When Land died in 1991, he left every scrap of his company’s documentation to Harvard Business School’s Baker Library, where over 4,000 linear feet of artifacts preserve the history of Polaroid Co. and its leader. Land also gave a hefty donation to the college, funding the establishment of its freshman seminar program. He is buried in Cambridge’s Mt. Auburn Cemetery, right next door to the school where it all began.

The face of Harvard Square is ever-changing, and stores and eateries open and close with breakneck speed. The effervescent voice at the corner of Mass. Ave. and Dunster St., however, remains the same. For the last 25 years, Gregory H. Daugherty has been a boisterous Square fixture.
Daugherty is a local vendor selling Spare Change News, a biweekly newspaper published by the Homeless Empowerment Project. Produced at the heart of Harvard Square in the basement of Old Cambridge Baptist Church, the newspaper is dedicated to issues of homelessness and social advocacy. It is designed to give its low-income vendors a chance to earn their own money: Vendors buy the newspapers from the company for 50 cents and then sell them for two dollars.
Around campus, Daugherty is something of a celebrity. He was friends with Matt Damon ’92 and even briefly appeared in Damon’s movie “Good Will Hunting,” according to Samuel Weems, distributional manager of Spare Change News. Daugherty confirms his affinity with Harvard students: “They love me. We get along just fine. After all, I saw them grow up—they come here as children and leave as adults.”
Daugherty says students constitute a large part of the newspaper’s readership. “We see a big boost in our sales when students are around, and summers can get a little lean for us,” Alejandro Ramirez, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, echoes.
Daugherty says that selling for “Spare Change News” has changed his life, allowing him to “survive by himself.” He enjoys working in the Square and interacting with the public—he feels like he’s part of a community. “They look out for me, and I look out for them,” Daugherty says.
Spare Change News’ connection to Harvard goes beyond the newspaper’s location. This year, several Harvard Law School students partnered with the publication’s former executive director, Katherine Bennett, to compile a legal handbook for vendors. Ramirez said that the playbook includes “information to recite and assert the vendor’s right to be there.”
Spare Change News’ other tie to Harvard is through The Crimson, which printed the fledgling newspaper during its first three years.
Shearer co-founded Spare Change News in 1992 along with Tim Harris and Tim Hobson. Shearer says the paper was created for two reasons: “We wanted to empower ourselves—instead of waiting on the powers that be to give us funding so that we can get off the street, we do it ourselves. And we wanted to give homeless people a voice.”
In the 25 years since its founding, the paper has had to adapt to a changing journalism landscape. Traditionally a print publication, Spare Change has been increasing its online presence, now offering a digital subscription for $49.99 a year. A portion of the subscription “defrays the cost of our vendor’s papers,” according to the publication’s website.
Ramirez anticipates even more changes for the future. “Our vendors have been very dedicated, but they are starting to age. They’re still as dedicated to this organization as anyone can be, but we’re wondering, how do we expand ourselves, not just geographically, but demographically,” Ramirez says. He also hopes that the biweekly publication becomes weekly and “more ambitious in terms of the types of issues we put out.”
Shearer emphasizes that the paper’s central goals have remained fixed. “Educating the public and empowering homeless people— we’ve never really gotten away from that,” he says. Another, bigger goal is eliminating homelessness altogether: “I hope we get to a day when we don’t need the paper.”

Behind a creaky door lies nearly a century of poetic history: The Grolier Poetry Book Shop has been an integral part of the Harvard Square community since 1927, making it the oldest continuously-run poetry shop in the US. On the Grolier’s 90th anniversary, FM speaks with Ifeanyi A. Menkiti, who became the owner of the shop in 2006.
Menkiti was born and raised in Nigeria and came to the U.S. to attend Pomona College, where he studied philosophy and literature. At Pomona, Menkiti received an award for his thesis on Ezra Pound, which he highlights as the starting point of his fascination with poetry.
“I came to have a great deal of respect for Pomona,” Menkiti says. “That this fine American college didn’t second guess themselves, that they had the guts, the courage to give the top prize in the English department to an African student—it showed integrity.”
Menkiti went on to become a professor of philosophy at Wellesley College, a position from which he retired in 2014. While teaching at Wellesley, he purchased the Grolier.
“I had this association with good vibes about poetry from Pomona. I believed in the longevity and continuity of the language,” Menkiti says. “The fact that [the Grolier is] still there when the big companies like Borders and Barnes and Noble are being swallowed up by Amazon shows how poetry can help to move the world along.
“After 9/11, people didn’t ask to read a book of history, or a novel—they wanted to read a book of poems,” Menkiti says. “In a time of happiness or discomfort, people seem to fall back on poetry. What is it about poetry that has this hold on us, that allows it to be a source of solace, grief, and celebration?”
Menkiti proposes that poetry’s association with music could be a potential explanation. “It seems to me that music is hardwired in our brains. In language, there is musicality, rhythmicity, and cadence. You see the orchestrations of the rise and flow of the human voice. Sometimes we forget the musicality that is in the ordinary language of the human tribes of the world.”
In the coming months, Menkiti has a few events planned for the bookstore’s 90th anniversary. On November 14, he plans to show the poetry of Donald Hall and e. e. cummings set to music at the Oberon Theater. If all goes well, he hopes to throw a gala in the spring, and an event at Sanders Theater. Finally, he intends to close down Plympton Street in April or May for a street party with live poetry readings, music, and food.
Raucous anniversary celebrations aside, there is something pleasantly steady about Grolier Poetry Book Shop. As campus construction and Square reshaping continues around it, the Grolier is still embedded firmly on Plympton Street, unchanging. Menkiti thinks poetry has a similar sense of finality.
“Once a poem is finished, it’s done. If you are writing a letter, you might say, ‘Well, I really want to make a very strong point,’ so you tweak the letter a little bit and you can play with it,” he says. “But there’s something about the poetic form that is done. You cannot change centuries of tradition.”

As a first-year student, Noah R. Wagner ’18 was placed in a suite with five female students. When Wagner—who, like many students quoted in this story, uses the pronouns they/them/theirs—applied to college, they identified their sex as female, the categorization Harvard used to determine their dorm assignment. Within the first few months of the school year, however, Wagner knew that word—and the identity that came with it—felt wrong.
“The way I had been assigned to this entryway—this formal gendered categorization of suites, the birth name on my door, the lack of open space to challenge any of that—made it hard to feel at home there,” Wagner says.
One of the first, most persistent and perhaps most inescapable places on Harvard’s campus where first-year students encounter traditional, binary ways of thinking about gender is their very own dorm. Now, as a senior and self-described “gender nihilist,” Wagner lives in Quincy House in mixed-gender housing. But the isolation they experienced three years ago is the lived reality of other first-year students today. Wagner is only one among many students for whom rigid ideas about gender, and the University policy and infrastructure that comes with it, feels restrictive.
In recent years, these policies have come under scrutiny. Following a push from the student group Trans Task Force, which aims to build community and advocate for issues relating to transgender people, the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life formed a committee to examine possibilities for establishing gender-inclusive first-year housing. And recent years have seen a proliferation of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus, including in some dorms.
But some students feel that change has been slow to come, especially in first-year housing. And that means that for now, they’re still left dealing with feelings of alienation, discomfort, and sometimes even fear.
Alone in their single dorm room in Hurlbut, trying on clothes and experimenting with different hairstyles, a first-year student whom The Crimson is identifying by their initials, M.D., says they can explore who they want to be—something they never considered before coming to Harvard.
“I didn’t feel like I could start to question my identity until I got here,” M.D., who uses the pronouns they/them, says. The Crimson granted M.D. anonymity because they have not publicly disclosed their gender identity.
Last summer, M.D. participated in the First-Year Urban Program, a pre-orientation program for incoming students focused on social justice and service. During FUP, M.D. says, introductions before every discussion typically included the opportunity for students to state their gender pronouns along with their name.
Before FUP, M.D. didn’t know that people could be referred to using words other than “he” or “she,” or even that a person could ask others to use certain pronouns to describe them. “Thinking about how it felt, imagining people calling me different things was a big part of how I was able to explore my gender identity,” M.D. says.
M.D. is still figuring out their gender identity, and feels free and comfortable doing so in the privacy of their single dorm room. But outside their room, M.D. often feels restricted by how other people think of gender: only two categorizations, men and women. At formal events like Freshman Convocation, when women are typically expected to wear dresses and men usually wear shirts and ties, M.D., who opted to wear a tie, recalls “feeling like I was trying to be forced into some concrete binary.”
And then there are everyday rituals, like using the bathroom. In M.D.’s dorm, floors are segregated by sex, with some designated female and others designated male. Unlike for upperclassmen, currently, mixed gender housing is not available for first year students. M.D. lives on a female-designated floor.
“I feel like an other. Like I’m not one of the women who lives on that floor,” M.D. says. “I am the other who lives on that floor. ”
For students who are not cisgender—who don’t identify with the gender they were assigned at birth—concerns about housing may begin before they’re even assigned roommates, even with the accommodations that the Freshman Dean’s Office seeks to make for students like M.D.
“An open-ended question” on the housing questionnaire for incoming first-year students asks whether there is “anything about their gender identity or sexual orientation that we should know in terms of housing,” Mike Ranen, resident dean of freshmen for Ivy Yard, says. “Students who talk about their gender identity there, that might mean they have special housing considerations,” he adds. Ranen says that he then follows up individually with each of those students in a phone call.
In those calls, incoming students discuss with Ranen which housing options best meet their needs. Students talk about whether they would prefer to live in a single or a suite; whether they would feel more comfortable living with students who identify as male or students who identify as female. Finally, they discuss whether they would like a private, in-suite bathroom or a hallway bathroom.
Harvard currently only allows sophomores, juniors and seniors—who, unlike first-year students, can choose their roommates—to opt for “mixed gender housing.” In upperclassman housing, men, women, trans students, nonbinary students, and students of other gender identities can live together in any combination within the limits of each House’s room offerings. Though the process of attaining mixed-gender housing varies across the 12 upperclassman Houses, all students seeking such housing must meet with their house administrator and sign a housing agreement. If upperclassmen don’t want to abide by the student handbook’s rules regarding gender in any capacity, they can opt to move to off-campus housing or live in the Dudley co-op. First-year students, however, are required to live on campus.
The FDO currently does not offer mixed-gender housing to first-year students. Instead, if students don’t make any other specifications on their housing forms, the FDO assigns  housing on the basis of sex as specified in the student’s Common Application. The Common App only asked students to disclose their sex until the 2016-2017 school year, when the admissions application also began to offer an optional open-ended text box to allow students “to further describe their gender identity.”
While the FDO organizes rooms by sex, Jasmine Waddell, resident dean of freshmen for Elm Yard, said the FDO “think[s] about both” sex and gender when assigning rooms.
“We’re responsive to needs,” Waddell says.”If I have a student who identifies as nonbinary, then I think about where they would live in terms of a space that’s supportive. But I do have rooms that are female rooms and I have rooms that are male rooms.”
When the FDO places trans, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming students with students who are cisgender, Waddell says the FDO ensures the cisgender students are “accepting” of all gender identities.
However, making arrangements is dependent on students knowing as incoming first-year students that their assigned sex does not align with their gender identity, and on their willingness to write openly about their gender identity on the housing questionnaire.
“Not everyone knows or is ready to express that they might be queer, trans, or gender nonconforming on a housing form to administrators they’ve never met. It’s not always clear how other people might bring transphobia into a rooming situation or otherwise make rooming uncomfortable,” Wagner says.
Wagner believes that while the addition of gender-neutral first-year housing would benefit everyone, the policy is “first and foremost a matter of safety for trans students.”
“When you’re coming into Harvard, the very first form that you fill out is the housing form. In order to have any kind of housing that would indicate that your gender is not aligned with sex, you have to basically out yourself on that form and then have this very intrusive conversation,” Helene C. Lovett ’20 says.
At the time when Lovett applied for housing, they described themself as female and therefore did not speak to Ranen or any other administrator about gender concerns in first-year housing.
Lovett had a positive experience with their first-year suitemates but said living in housing segregated by sex “made my experience with understanding the ambiguity of gender within myself a lot slower.... It would’ve been a lot easier to go through gender transitions in a mixed gender environment with people you know would be comfortable with that.”
While some students report a binary gender identity on their housing questionnaire because of their understanding of their gender at the time, others do so because they believe identifying as such will make for a simpler housing experience.
“I wrote ‘male’ because I thought it would be easier. I hadn’t fully come out to myself yet,” a student in Kirkland says.  The Crimson granted this student anonymity because they have not publicly disclosed their gender identity. “Even if I had figured it out earlier, even if I had put ‘female,’ there would’ve been a follow up. If I say male, that’s the end of it. No one’s gonna ask me any questions.”
The Kirkland student says that regardless of how well a student gets along with roommates, the environment created by first-year sex-segregated or single-gender housing was not conducive to nontraditional gender expression.
“It kind of felt like it was forcing me back in. I wouldn’t have felt comfortable walking around my room in a dress,” the Kirkland student says.“Your first year, you’re already nervous about making a good impression…. You know that you’re going to walk into a room of cis people, [and] if not cis people, you’re going to be walking into a gendered room.”
Even for students who do express concerns about gender on the housing questionnaire, uncertainty about the comfort and safety of their housing situation remains.
“One of my concerns was that my gender identity isn’t super established yet other than the non-female part,” Ming Li Wu ’21 says. Wu worried about the possibility of their gender identity and presentation changing during the semester. Would their roommates reject them?
“I see my gender as a very fluid thing, which might change in the future, but might also not. I feel like there’s not really room for me to express it that way,” Wu says. “Whenever there are such strong binary things like housing, that definitely doesn’t leave any room for fluidity or change or question. You have to make a decision and you are in that space and you cannot easily leave.”
For now, such student concerns are handled on an individual basis, often beginning with a conversation with the FDO. The response to different students’ circumstances—such as transitioning their gender during the school year—“depends on their needs,” says Dean Waddell.
“If they need to take a leave, if they need to be in a different living space, then we’ll discuss those needs as they arise.”
As a first-year student eager to see fundamental change in the Harvard housing system, Wagner found community and activism in Trans Task Force, a group of Harvard and Cambridge area community members that focuses on intersectional issues facing trans people. “Organically out of conversations around our needs arose a desire to see accommodations around campus that don’t isolate, alienate, or erase trans people,” Wagner says.
During the spring 2017 semester, TTF members began to discuss ways that Harvard’s campus could become more gender inclusive.
“We found a running theme that housing, bathrooms, and other spatial accommodations actively made it difficult to take seriously the questions coming up for us,” Wagner says. “Looking to peer institutions and envisioning what was possible at Harvard, it seemed really straightforward to implement a gender-inclusive housing option.”
TTF members reached out to Sheehan D. Scarborough, Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and raised concerns about first-year housing at a University-wide BGLTQ town hall. TTF later met with Waddell to discuss the matter. During the summer of 2017, the FDO invited TTF to send some of its members to represent the organization in meetings about gender-inclusive housing for first-year students with the FDO and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
Waddell says that when the FDO became aware of TTF’s advocacy for first-year gender-inclusive housing, “we saw it as a moment where we could take our mutual interests and catalyze and prioritize it for this year.” This fall, the FDO and BGLTQ Office formed a committee that aims to draft a proposal that would instate what the committee is calling “gender-inclusive housing” for first-year students. Members include students from TTF and  the Office of BGLTQ Student Life as well as administrators from the FDO, BGLTQ Office, and the Office of Student Life.
Scarborough, who is a member of the committee, wrote in an e-mailed statement that the committee is “being intentional about this process and about including student voices and perspectives in this important work.”
Lily M. Velona ’18, a member of Trans Task Force, thinks that the committee is a promising sign. “What we’ve seen is an increasing willingness on the part of the administration as time has gone on.,” Velona says. “I think as people [have understood] the need for gender-neutral housing as a need of safety and the ability for students to thrive here, the commitment to making sure that first years do have a gender-neutral housing option has increased.”
But some hurdles remain. According to Dean Ranen, two questions control whether Harvard will begin to offer gender-inclusive housing to first-year students: “Whether or not we should [offer gender-inclusive housing], and then how [we do so] logistically within our housing system and our housing questions.”
One such logistical concern is the fact that some students are under the age of 18 when they arrive at Harvard, which could bring complications to offering them mixed-gender housing.
For issues like these, the committee receives legal advice from the Office of the General Counsel, according to Ranen.
In the current housing system, the architecture of some first-year dorms limits where students who need special accommodations can live. For example, dorms in Elm Yard have no singles, so students who might want to live alone because of their gender identities are unable to live in DeWolfe, Grays, Matthews, or Weld.
The committee is also benchmarking, or evaluating how other colleges and universities approach gender in housing. The University of Pennsylvania became the first school in the Ivy League to offer gender-neutral housing to students, initially only upperclassmen, in fall 2005.  In 2010 Yale became the last Ivy to offer mixed gender housing, though its availability was limited to seniors. In fall 2012, Penn became the first Ivy to allow first-year students to choose to live in gender-neutral housing.
But still, in part because of legal issues, “The models are that most schools do not offer gender-inclusive housing for first-year students,” Ranen says. “If students are under 18, they usually require parental consent... Most schools now offer gender-inclusive housing for upperclass students. For first year students, it’s similar to what we do, where we have individual conversations with students who might have a specific need. That’s why we’re treading slowly.”
Waddell, who serves as the FDO’s liaison to the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, says the FDO has been evaluating the possibility of offering gender-inclusive housing for first-years throughout the five years she’s worked there, and perhaps longer. Still, Waddell is hopeful.
“We’re doing it in a very collaborative way, which is a different model than other efforts on campus,” Waddell says. “I think that will lead to a better outcome.”
Ranen emphasizes that the committee is in its “exploratory” stages.
“It’s too early to state anything definitive yet,” he says. Ranen does have some ideas, however, regarding how gender-inclusive housing might work if Harvard decides to implement it for first-year students. For example, Ranen anticipates that rooms designated “gender-inclusive” would be spread across the first-year dorms rather than contained to one or a few entryways.
Though the working group continues to consider logistics, at least regarding the committee’s first consideration—whether or not the committee “should” offer gender-inclusive housing—some students see a clear need for gender-inclusive housing.
“Being a college freshman is a big time of transition for everyone. If a freshman is struggling with their gender identity, then it’s important for them to feel support and safe in that,” Wu says.
Some students believe that the current lack of gender-inclusive housing for first-year students is a reflection of a larger lack of conversation about gender.
“Housing is a symptom,” the Kirkland student says. “We talk a lot about gender in terms of a binary. Other than that, not so much. When I’m walking around in dress or when I’m walking around in a skirt, it still feels very disruptive. Even at a place like Harvard, it almost feels like a political act, just my existence. At a place like Harvard it shouldn’t be like that. We just don’t talk about it plain enough.”
Students noted that offering gender-inclusive housing for first-year students could change campus culture.
“If freshmen come here and have the example of mixed-gender housing, it could help them to interact with people on the basis of who they are rather than their gender,” Colin J. McGinn ’21 says. McGinn called organization and segregation by gender  “a system that’s so deeply entrenched that people believe it from birth and simply take it without thinking.”
McGinn believes a move to more gender-inclusive housing could be a step closer to “abolishing, or at least recognizing the multiplicity of, this system we call gender.”
McGinn also believes a move to more gender-inclusive housing could be a step closer to “abolishing or at least recognizing the multiplicity of this system we call gender.”

By the time the Cambridge City Council preliminary election results came out early Wednesday morning, Nadya T. Okamoto ’20 hadn’t slept for four days.
Okamoto was one of two Harvard sophomores gunning for spots on Cambridge governing bodies. Both lost in the preliminary counts.
Okamoto and her campaign team, as well as close family and friends, gathered at a small viewing party at The Middle East restaurant in Central Square as the technical problems facing the election commission unfolded into a hours-long delay.
As Okamoto ate her dinner in Lowell dining hall Wednesday evening, two friends came up to hug her. She said that her entire day had been filled with interactions like these.
“It’s just been a whole day of everyone saying, ‘I’m so sorry,’” Okamoto said. “But honestly, I’m feeling good.”
Sophomore William H. MacArthur ’20, a Cambridge local, ran for the Cambridge School Committee. Even though the vote didn’t turn out the way he had hoped, MacArthur said, he has full faith in the elected school committee members.
“I was obviously hoping for a different result, but I’m feeling personally pretty good,” MacArthur said. “I’m proud of the number of...votes that I got.”
The election’s conclusion means a return to normal Harvard life for the two candidates. For MacArthur, this will include more time for school and friends, “and just being a person, which is good,” he added.
Looking further ahead, both candidates said that they don’t plan to run for the same positions again.
“Aspects of this were fun, lots of aspects weren’t, and in terms of my own personal happiness and well-being, I think my ideal outcome is never running for it again,” MacArthur said.
Okamoto said that she doesn’t see herself re-running right now because the newly elected candidates in the City Council supply the perspectives that she thought she would bring, she said. She added that she wouldn’t run just because she wanted a position, because running the campaign is the “most terrifying and exhausting thing that you could do.”
“I don’t think anyone should run for a office because they want the title. I think it really has to be issue based, and I’m really trying to hold myself accountable to that,” Okamoto said.
Despite the outcomes, both candidates said that they’re both glad that they ran in this election.
“I don’t really have regrets about running,” Okamoto said.

Harvard launched a five-year lecture series to commemorate the career of a Mexican archaeologist, an effort to promote work from Harvard’s office in Mexico City.
The lecture series, which began this semester, celebrates the 40-year collaboration between Divinity School professor Davíd Carrasco and Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, Mexico’s premier archaeologist who has led excavations to uncover remains of a temple in the former Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.
Carrasco served as an interpreter to Matos Moctezuma and deciphered the meanings behind the archaeologist's findings.
Carrasco decided to create the lecture series in the name of Matos Moctezuma, calling him “a culture hero of Mexico” for his contribution to the country’s indigenous history.
“Here you have Harvard for the first time setting up a lecture series to honor a Mexican in Mexico City,” Carrasco said. “This new collaboration was significant for Mexico and significant for Harvard.”
The lecture series consists of two lectures each year—one in Mexico during the fall semester and at Harvard during the spring. Every year for the next five years, an academic committee will select a new lecturer for each series.
Along with Carrasco himself, many Harvard scholars traveled to Mexico last month to inaugurate the series’ first lecture, delivered by Matos Moctezuma.
Carrasco also led a tour of Mexico City for faculty, including Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton and Mark C. Elliott, vice provost for international affairs.
In his introductory remarks at the first lecture in Mexico, Elliott said he appreciates the University’s strong relationship with its Mexican partners.
“It’s clear that in addition to academic partnership and intellectual partnership, there is two friendship and collegiality as well,” he said. “That I think is the spirit that has animated this  partnership for decades and is one of the reasons why it has been so successful.”
Carrasco said he hopes the lecture series marks the start of a more substantial relationship with the University’s partner institutions in Mexico.
“The series is to educate people from Harvard about Mexico’s richness and bring more of these stories of Mexican history and religion to our students here at Harvard,” Carrasco said.
Given the what he characterized as a fraught state of international relations between Mexico and the United States, Carrasco said he thinks it is especially important to promote knowledge about Mexico’s culture and history.
“I think that people need to understand that we’re citizens of the Americas and not just America and the stronger relationship we have with Mexico is going to help the United States in educating people about diversity,” Carrasco said.

Former Senior Adviser to President Barack Obama Valerie J. Jarrett reviewed the highs and lows of the Obama administration and gave an insider’s perspective on the 44th president of the United States at an Institute of Politics event Wednesday night.
Jarrett, who served as Obama’s advisor from 2009 to 2017, spoke for roughly an hour. She said the role of senior adviser involved performing a wide range of tasks—from working on Obama’s presidential transition team to collaborating with Republican governors to manage the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
“It was invigorating, it was terrifying,” she said. “I have never seen so many people work so hard under such extraordinarily challenging circumstances.”
Jarrett said this electrifying work style was typical of her time at the White House. She pointed to one especially hectic week in June 2015 when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act and ruled in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage—all while the nation was still reeling from the deadly June 17 shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C.
Jarrett devoted a large portion of her visit Wednesday evening to discussing her personal relationship with the Obamas. She said she spent a lot of time with the Obamas—who she said are like “family” to her—in Chicago in the 1990s, and that she particularly remembered recruiting Michelle Obama to work for the Chicago city government.
She also shared favorite memories of Barack Obama, like the time a veteran surprised the then-United States Senator with a badge he had long worn on his uniform.
“[The veteran] said, ‘I’ve carried this with me for 40 years. It’s kept me safe while serving our country. It’s given me courage during tough times. And you have a heart, and I want you to have it,” Jarrett said. “And then, I burst into tears.”
Jarrett said Obama carried trinkets like the soldier’s badge around the White House with him almost every day. She referred to the veteran’s gift—and Obama’s response—as one of the reasons she chose to work in government in the first place.
She said she has never regretted choosing to spend her career in public service.
“I wouldn’t trade the best days of my life in the private sector for the worst days of my life in the public sector,” she said.
Jarrett closed the evening by calling on young people to vote and run for office.
“Own your ability to be the change,” she said.

UPDATED: November 9, 2017 at 3:17 p.m.
Ralph Nader, a political activist and repeat third-party presidential candidate, called on Law School students to protest what he characterized as the school’s excessively “corporate” focus at a visit to the school Wednesday.
Nader, a Harvard Law graduate, drew a grim picture of the American legal system, saying that Harvard churns out “lucrative cogs in the corporate wheel.” He referenced student debt, hidden bank fees, and unintelligible contracts that consumers don’t read as examples of injustice in the legal system.
“The curriculum is built around corporate law, and corporate power, and corporate perpetration, and corporate defense,” Nader said.
In an interview last week—before Nader came to campus—Dean of the Law School John F. Manning ’82 discussed the Law School's efforts to promote public interest careers, saying that students in the class of 2017 spent an average of 586 hours working pro bono.
“Harvard Law School is very supportive of public interest,” Manning said. “From the very outset we have a very large, energetic office of public advising, we have a program on law and social change that really helps people identify and think about careers that try to affect social change.”
Pete D. Davis ’12, a third-year Law School student who authored a report also criticizing the Law School’s public interest resources, invited Nader to speak at the Law School. In the report, Davis wrote that ordinary Americans lack legal power and encouraged the Law School to “better live up to our mission”.
“I have a keystone reform that I want: the majority of law school grads to deploy their legal educations for the majority of their careers in service of the public,” Davis said in an interview.
The Langdell Hall lecture room was filled with Law School affiliates, and the audience gave Nader a standing ovation at the end of his address.
But Nader’s speech, delivered on the anniversary of the 2016 presidential election, struck a nerve with other attendees. Some audience members expressed skepticism about the effect of third-party presidential bids—both Nader’s in 2000 and those of Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in 2016.
Nader defended all three campaigns, saying that he believed “in an equal right to run, and equal right to get votes from all the people.”
“The two major parties often represent minority opinions,” Nader added.
Nader ended his speech by  arguing that the Law School has a responsibility to cultivate justice-minded graduates, and current students ought to hold administrative feet to the fire until it does.
“You’re in the top one percent,” Nader said. “What are you going to do with it?”

At this year’s meeting of the Harvard Crimson and the Yale Bulldogs in New Haven, Conn., undergraduate tailgates sponsored by both schools will be shortened to two hours and more stringently restrict students’ access to alcohol.
Previously, Harvard-Yale tailgates at the Yale Bowl lasted for three and a half hours. Andy Dunn, a Yale senior associate athletic director, wrote in an email that the decision to shorten the tailgates was part of an overall review of the events and to make the tailgates the same duration as at Harvard.
“The change in the timing of the tailgate at Yale better aligns it with the tailgating experience had at Harvard,” Dunn wrote.
Yale is also tightening its regulations on alcohol at student tailgates, banning outside alcohol and requiring students to purchase drinks through a pre-approved vendor, Dunn wrote.
“All registered tailgates will be required to purchase alcohol through a centralized vendor that will deliver the purchases to the tailgates on the day of the game,” Dunn wrote. “Outside alcohol is not permitted.”
The new policy will apply to only undergraduate tailgate in the “Student Tailgate Village,” not personal tailgates in parking lots, according to Yale spokesperson Steve Conn.
Jack W. Deschler ’19, a Cabot House Committee co-chair, said the shortened tailgates make planning easier on Harvard’s HoCos.
“It means that we have to find fewer people to staff, which means we can get more people staffing at any given time, which I think is gonna actually make for a better experience,” Deschler said. “We don’t have to be there quite as early in the morning, which is great for us as well.”
Harvard’s Houses will team up to organize tailgates by upperclassmen residential neighborhoods, similar to last year when The Game took place in Cambridge, Mass., according to Deschler.
“Despite the shorter duration this year due to the earlier kickoff, we are still really excited for the House Tailgates for The Game,” Alec K. Reed ’18, a Leverett HoCo co-chair, wrote in an email. “It’s a great way for the Harvard community to rally together, especially with the Houses merging into neighborhoods again this year.
The undergraduate student tailgates will begin at 10:30 a.m. on Nov. 18 in the “Student Tailgate Village” on the outdoor courts of Yale’s Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center. Harvard’s Houses, the First-Year Social Committee, Yale’s Colleges, and the Yale College Council are all sponsoring the event.
The stricter rules represent a further step to promote safety at The Game. At the 2011 match-up, a woman was killed after being struck by a Yale student driving a U-Haul truck.
The Crimson will take the field against the Bulldogs at 12:30 p.m.

The city of Cambridge has teamed up with Harvard to keep several key walkways in the Square open as several construction close down traditional thoroughfares.
Harvard and Cambridge have sought to keep the area around the Smith Campus Center walkable during the renovation of the building, fencing off makeshift sidewalks on Mt. Auburn St. and Mass. Ave., according to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
“Taking into account traffic patterns and construction logistics, the University and the appropriate city departments together determine the safest crosswalk locations and pedestrian right-of-ways,” University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email.
Cara B. Seiderman ’81, transportation program manager for Cambridge’s Community Development Department, said the city has been committed to pedestrian safety for a long time. Cambridge was named the most walkable city in the nation by Governing Magazine in 2013.
Seiderman also serves as city staff lead for the Cambridge Pedestrian Committee, which includes both community members appointed by the city manager and city staff. The committee reviews all projects related to pedestrian safety.
According to Seiderman, the committee looks to improve access and safety by identifying traffic signals that need to be changed and streets that could benefit from additional crosswalks.
Seiderman also added that construction is sometimes necessary in order to make streets safer and more accessible. According to Seiderman, the public parks department works alongside construction workers to ensure that streets are pedestrian-friendly.
Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20 said that certain areas of construction have impeded pedestrian access from DeWolfe and Plympton Streets to Mt. Auburn Street: “Those two crosswalks are the most problematic ones,” she said.
Seiderman agreed that the city should strive for improvement with policies like “Vision Zero” that focus on preventing traffic deaths.
“The city adopted a Vision Zero strategy,” Seiderman said. “We would like to see zero fatalities and severe injuries for all modes of traffic. Luckily, the city is relatively safe when you look at other cities, but we really want to make it the safest that we possibly can.”

Dozens of students, alumni, and professors gathered to honor the life of Alexander H. Patel ’17 -’18, a Harvard senior from Denver, Colo., at a memorial service hosted by the College in Memorial Church Wednesday evening.
Patel died unexpectedly in late October at the age of 22. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an Nov. 2 email announcing the memorial service that Patel’s loss was “felt deeply” by Harvard affiliates.
“Many of us knew Alexander as a brilliant and supportive classmate, and as a true friend,” Khurana wrote in the email. “Both the service and the reception will prove the opportunity for those in our community whose lives were touched by Alexander to come together.”
Patel, a Philosophy and Mathematics concentrator and award-winning former Crimson News editor, died by suicide, according to the Massachusetts Medical Examiner’s Office.
At the service Wednesday evening, family and administrators—including Khurana—spoke about Patel’s kindness and devotion to his friends. Others remembered Patel as a brilliant student with wide intellectual interests ranging from computer science to ancient Greek classics.
On campus, Patel worked as a teaching fellow for various Computer Science classes, conducted research in a lab run by Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83, and held a side job as an information technology consultant. He also wrote covered Harvard Business School for The Crimson and served on the paper’s data analysis team.
A data-based 2015 story on faculty political donations Patel helped report earned him a national award from the Associated Collegiate Press.
“He was an unbelievable friend, and he never hesitated to bring me into his life or to be generous with his time,” said Christopher P. Barry, one of Patel’s high school friends. “He was one of the best people I ever knew. He deserves to be remembered as such.”

UPDATED: November 15, 2017 at 1:24 p.m.
Supporters of Harvard’s student unionization effort held a rally in the Yard and delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall Wednesday, urging the University to drop its appeal to the federal National Labor Relations Board.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers’ rally, held on the one-year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s election, accused Harvard of relying on the majority-Republican NLRB to stack the deck against the union effort.
“It is not okay to use the Trump administration appointments to the labor board to roll back workers’ rights everywhere,” graduate student and union organizer Niharika N. Singh said in a speech at the rally. “It is not okay to deny your student-workers the right to a fair, democratic process.”
Union supporters rallied on the same day as U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders penned a letter urging University President Drew G. Faust to support student unionization.
“I urge you to support the legal rights of research and teaching assistants at your university to form unions and bargain in good faith with them,” Sanders wrote. “After all, these workers are key to the success of your university.”
In July, an NLRB official ruled that Harvard had not provided an adequate list of eligible voters ahead of the November 2016 unionization election. By law, employers must distribute a list of all workers who are eligible to vote before union elections.
Weeks later, Harvard appealed that ruling to the five-person NLRB, labor law’s highest ruling body. Trump recently appointed two new Republican members and the board now has a conservative majority. It is unclear whether the board will decide to hear the case and, if so, when it will release its decision.
Harvard administrators have argued that the University is not trying to skirt labor law, instead holding that the original election was valid.
“Students were well-informed, voted in large numbers, and, according to the initial vote count, voted against forming a union,” FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement. “The University believes that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of well-informed students, should stand, and has appealed the Regional Director’s decision to the contrary.”
Abhinav Reddy, an organizer for HGSU-UAW, said he supports the unionization effort because students might not be able to “count on administrators here to look out for the best interests of me and my peers.”
He said that, as an alum, he is disappointed that Harvard appealed to the federal NLRB.
“It appals us to see my university’s name in the news, seeing them try to union bust, seeing them try to get in the way of democratic processes all across the country,” Reddy said.
Harvard has argued that the decision to appeal does not deny voters’ democratic rights.
“Harvard students voted in large numbers, and they voted against unionization, a fact that the HGSU-UAW does not acknowledge,” the Provost’s website reads. “To drop the appeal and agree to a second election would be to ignore the votes and voices of the majority of eligible voters that were expressed through this election process. Harvard believes their votes should be respected and be allowed to stand.”
A group of faculty members also voiced their support for HGSU-UAW. Kennedy School professor Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 said he thought many faculty members support the union.
“We understand how hard graduate students work, how much graduate students teach, how vulnerable graduate students are,” McCarthy said. He added that the question of student unionization was a “no-brainer” because workers have a right to unionize.
An estimated 275 people gathered for the protest, according to graduate student and union organizer Andy Donnelly. Members of other advocacy groups, including the undergraduate Student Labor Action Movement, also spoke at the event.

Harvard Divinity School had a unique addition to its campus green this week: A metallic-gold shipping container equipped with immersive video technology, connecting Cambridge students with refugees from Iraq, Gaza City, Jordan, and Germany.
The Portals Project, launched by Amar C. Bakshi ’06, connects people across the world in life-sized video-conference conversations. Diane L. Moore, director of the Divinity School’s Religious Literacy Project, partnered with the Portals Project to bring political refugees—virtually—to campus.
Moore said she was inspired to bring the portals to Cambridge after traveling to Iraq and asking how to further awareness of the country’s refugee crisis.
“They said, ‘Please just share our stories. We’re fearful that people don’t really know about what’s happening to us,’” Moore said.
The portals are free and open to the public, managed by full-time curators who organize and facilitate conversations between users.
Since the portals went up last week, Moore said that many from Harvard have gotten to speak with refugees. Just this week, Moore said, a Divinity School student  and a 15-year-old Jordanian student connected while discussing music and their families.
The Jordanian student shared a song her family often sings. In response, Boley decided to share a song that was important to her grandmother, who recently passed away.
“She sang Ave Maria, and it was magical,” Moore said. “It was incredible to see that human connection about things that aren’t just about the challenges we face.”
Students from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School also visited the portal to speak with other high schoolers from the Middle East.
Elvira Horvei, a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School who entered the portal, said the experience was simultaneously normal and surreal.
“It was awkward at first, but then everything seemed really natural with all of us just having a normal conversation on commitment and relationships,” she said.
Moore said she hopes that these small moments of conversation will shape students’ views of global issues of migration and displacement.
“We thought this would be a great opportunity to give a human face to the 65 million displaced persons in the world,” she said. “You can’t possibly know what that means.”
Bakshi, who founded the Portals Project, said he began it after traveling as a journalist and hearing stories about life outside the United States.
“To pass the time, I’d talk to strangers, and they would become deep conversations where we were lost in the world together,” Bakshi said.
The Divinity School portal will be open through Nov. 9.

A day after the Faculty voted down an effort to nullify the College’s penalties on single-gender social groups, the leaders of the Undergraduate Council released survey results indicating that 61 percent of undergraduate respondents support abandoning the sanctions.
In total, 21 percent of respondents ranked an outright ban on social groups as their top option in the survey. An additional 19 percent supported the original May 2016 sanctions as their first choice.
In an email Wednesday evening, UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 released the results of the survey, which was open to undergraduates for about a week. In total, 1,875 undergraduates responded to the survey, representing slightly over one in four College students.
The pair also sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust with the results on Monday evening, requesting that she share the results with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences ahead of their monthly meeting on Tuesday. The letter and survey follow repeated public comments from Sachee, a member of the all-female Bee Club, and Khansarinia opposing the College’s social group penalties.
Under the current policy, which went into effect with the Class of 2021, members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations are barred from holding campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
But the Faculty on Tuesday rejected a motion designed to nullify the College’s policy in a major victory for Harvard administrators. The motion, introduced by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, stated that the College shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization.”
From the outset, though, students criticized the survey for failing to ensure statistical validity, misrepresenting student opinion, and not including a question asking about membership in unrecognized social groups—critiques that Sachee and Khansarinia refute.
“Yesterday’s Faculty vote shows that the University is moving ahead on the USGSO issue,” Sachee and Khansarinia wrote in the Wednesday email. “Soon President Faust will make her final decision on the best path forward.”
Indeed, Faust must now select one of three options proposed in September by a committee of students and administrators who met to reevaluate the College’s May 2016 policy on final clubs and Greek organizations. Faust has said that she will make a decision before stepping down in June.
Faust could choose to maintain the current penalties for members of single-gender social organizations or take a different approach. She will choose between maintaining the current sanctions, banning membership in unrecognized groups, or coming up with an alternative.
In their letter to Faust, Sachee and Khansarinia wrote that they were not granted permission to present the results to the Faculty at Tuesday’s meeting.
In a Crimson survey conducted in November 2016, 53 percent of respondents held an unfavorable view of the College’s original social group penalties.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Penn wide receiver Justin Watson is likely bound for the NFL. First he must pass through Harvard Stadium.
The reigning Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year has visited once before. In 2015, Watson totaled 249 yards of offense on 12 touches. The climax came in the fourth quarter, when the then-sophomore took a handoff at his own 21, swept right, and outraced the world to the end zone.
The score iced a 35-25 victory for the Quakers—meaning the only loss of the season for the 2015 Crimson. Harvard veterans remember the disappointment, and they remember the man who caused it.
The truth is that Watson has inflicted heartbreak on many opponents. Just last week, he grabbed a 15-yard touchdown with 1:12 left to send Princeton to a 38-35 defeat.
You should predict this production from someone picked as a preseason All-American. You should expect big numbers from someone who has led the Ancient Eight in catches, yards, and scores in the last two seasons and taken over Penn records for receptions and yards. You should anticipate highlight reel moments, such as the 17-yard score in week five that forced overtime against then-undefeated Columbia.
The expectation is exactly what makes Watson so special. Opponents know where the ball is going. They have seen the film. They can strategize for weeks. And still, Watson collects his yards.
“He’s what our kids would call ‘a dude,’” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s absolutely one of the best wide receivers I’ve ever seen.”
It’s easy to run out of adjectives when describing Watson, so let’s start with one: steely.
Steely, because Watson grew up Bridgeville, Pa., about 15 minutes outside of industrial capital Pittsburgh. Watson’s grandfather, in fact, was a steelworker. There’s a reason that the Pittsburgh football team is called the Steelers, and a reason that Watson roots for them.
Steely, also because Watson is built like a 6’3” iron column. He weighs 225 pounds, up 15 pounds from last year and a total of 40 since high school. It takes a lot of muscle to hold up an offense.
But steely, more than anything else, because Watson rarely yields. His Twitter bio reads, “Commitment is when the purpose in your heart is stronger than the pain in your body.” That attitude manifests every Saturday, when a grueling offseason regimen translates into on-field success.
At no point was the formula more apparent than the summer of 2016, when Watson worked in Philadelphia. The Wharton School student took an internship at Logan Circle Partners, an asset management firm, and worked in the same office as then-quarterback Alek Torgersen.
The thrower-receiver duo ate lunch at Wawa. Sometimes they tossed a Styrofoam football around the office. At 5 p.m., they caught the subway back to campus for strength training and passing drills.
Harvard seniors have strong memories of last November’s game, when the Quakers upset the Crimson after Watson caught a two-yard touchdown. Well, the Penn star had been practicing that post route non-stop for several months.
“We know he’s going to get his catches,” senior safety Tanner Lee said. “We’ve got to keep him contained.”
Watson’s work ethic originates with his parents. Doug and Terri each worked two jobs as they raised four children. Watson—who has not available for comment due to Penn restrictions on midweek interviews with athletes—learned to contribute. His oldest brother Tommy has cerebral palsy, and Watson helped with caretaking.
Watson has continued that supporting role as a member of the Quakers. In 2015, Penn football named Vhito DeCapria as an honorary team captain. DeCapria, a six-year-old cancer survivor, has remained with the team and latched onto Watson as his favorite player. Watson, in turn, has made time to hang out with DeCapria.
Still, Watson’s dedication is most obvious on the gridiron, where he outclasses defensive backs with precise footwork, soft hands, and strength.
“He’s hard to single-cover,” Murphy said. “Even when you do cover him, he’s so big and physical that they stuff the ball into him.”
Watson emerged at South Fayette, a suburban high school with roughly 200 students per grade. As a senior, Watson captained the football team to a 16-0 season, including a 41-0 romp in the Class AA championship. Watson finished the year with 1,568 receiving yards (fourth in state history) and 22 touchdowns (third in state history).
Typically, such a stat line would attract attention from major FBS programs. Throw in Watson’s all-around athleticism—as evidenced by his captain role in the basketball team—and you wonder why Big 10 schools didn’t come calling.
The wrinkle was that Watson had committed to Penn before his senior year. He stayed true to the obligation even as several FBS recruiters tried to change his mind.
The Quakers are certainly glad that Watson proved stubborn. Before this season, on Aug. 18, the Philadelphia Inquirer published an article called “A Penn football all-American? Justin Watson fits the bill.” That story contained some braggadocio from Watson: “I think I’d start on any FBS team in the country.” Few could disagree. Some, in fact, would go further.
Princeton graduate Ross Tucker played for five NFL teams as an offensive lineman before becoming a television analyst. Midway through the 2017 season, Tucker pronounced that Watson “may be the best Ivy player in my 20 years in the league.”
“The kid could play anywhere,” Murphy said. “He’s definitely a pro prospect in our league.”
Watson has the numbers to substantiate the claim. In 2014, the wide receiver set Quakers freshman records with 42 catches and 497 yards. The lone setback came in the form of a shoulder injury, which required offseason surgery.
The rust never showed, as Watson returned to place fifth in the FCS in receptions and yards. He landed on the All-American third team.
In 2016, Watson did even better, seizing a school record with 1,115 receiving yards—in other words, over 100 per game. This time, he landed on the All-American second team and finished as a finalist for the FCS Offensive Player of the Year.
Do you spot any patterns? Murphy does. When asked about Watson, the coach widened his eyes and let out a sigh.
“He’s got it all,” Murphy said. “How many 6’3”, 220-plus-pound wide receivers are there in the country that can run a 10.8 hundred meters, have great hands, and are tough, dependable, and physical?”
The 2015 game was only the first time that Watson tormented Harvard. The next season, the wide receiver caught 10 passes for 120 yards. When Penn received the ball with 3:23 left in a 14-14 game, Watson spearheaded the drive. He extended the possession with a third-and-eight catch and scored the final touchdown.
This Saturday, the Crimson has about 57 reasons to fixate on Watson. As opponents have learned repeatedly, though, it’s not enough to focus on the wide receiver. It’s not enough to scheme well or throw extra defenders.
Put it this way—you can hammer steel as much as you want, but rarely does it break.
“He’s a great player,” Lee said. “We just have to go out there, compete, and play our best football.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In nine days, we will know which team—or teams—will be crowned Ivy League champions.
Much to the delight of sports writers everywhere, the possibility of a seven-team tie for first place is still in the picture. If there were ever a better storyline to root for, I am not aware of it.
Of course, this zany finish requires that one team finishes winless—in this case, Brown is that team.
However, it seems as though our neighbors to the south have different priorities these days anyway. This coming spring, the university will offer a course called “Memes and the Language of the Internet,” according to The Tab.
In that spirit, here are a few classic memes—in text format—that can be applied to the Bears’ current season:
“Live look at Brown football,” accompanied by a picture of a dumpster fire with the Brown seal photoshopped on.
“This is fine,” says a cartoon dog wearing a Bears hat sitting in the middle of a burning room.
“When someone tells you Brown has a competent football program,” overlaid on a picture of a confused-looking Nick Young.
Not really sure if those will translate in print, but oh well. Picks incoming.
DARTMOUTH VS. BROWN
Never have I been more invested in an ATI section than I am right now.
No, I am not referring to my prediction for this game. That’s pretty obvious—the Bears are being outscored by 15 points per game, so Dartmouth should walk away with this one fairly easily.
What I really want to talk about is this game’s location. As you’ll notice, this section did not begin with “Dartmouth at Brown” or “Brown at Dartmouth.” Instead, it is a neutral game being played at Fenway Park. According to Google Maps, that’s a breezy eight-minute drive from Harvard Stadium. (Or a 55-minute walk, if you are so inclined. Though I’m not sure why you would be.)
The point is Fenway is within walking distance of Harvard’s home turf, yet the Crimson is not participating in the Fenway Gridiron Series. Even a few Massachusetts high school teams get to play their Thanksgiving games at the old ballpark.
No offense to the historic Harvard Stadium, but Fenway Park (opened in 1912) is almost futuristic compared to the home of Harvard football (built in 1903). As a lifelong Sox fan, I am disheartened that I won’t have the chance to cover Harvard football on Yawkey Way, to say the least.
But there’s nothing I can do about that now, just like there is nothing the Bears will be able to do against the Big Green on Friday night. Here’s an idea for Dartmouth: for one week, change the team’s nickname to the Green Monster (I’ll collect royalties on all merchandise, of course).
Pick: Dartmouth 37, Brown 10
YALE AT PRINCETON
According to NJ.com and documents known as the “Paradise Papers,” Princeton is one of many universities allegedly keeping money in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes in the United States.  Though it is unclear just how legal or illegal this bookkeeping arrangement is, I think it does reveal one thing: Princeton is saving up to pioneer quarterback cloning technology.
Senior Chad Kanoff is a revelation to Ivy League football, and the Tigers cannot afford to lose his production in 2018.
The Princeton signal caller zips passes through windows seemingly too small to allow a football to pass unimpeded. He is equally adept at the short screen pass and the long bomb.
If I’ve learned one thing this season, it is that Kanoff could impose his will on any opposing defense. The senior has completed 91 passes for 1142 yards over his past three games. This year, he has 22 touchdowns in the air; to put that in perspective for Harvard fans, the Crimson has 23 total.
Kanoff’s crew will not coast through this game, however. It has to contend with a Yale defensive unit that has limited opponents to just 15.3 points per game. Since Yale boasts a potent offense as well, this should be a close one. Some consolation for the Tigers if they end up losing: Kanoff 2.0 is likely on the way, so there’s always next year.
Pick: Yale 27, Princeton 26
COLUMBIA AT CORNELL
Ah, the Empire State Bowl. Historically an event for bragging rights among the two most woeful Ivies, the New York showdown will be one of the most important Ancient Eight games this season.Nothing says “The Empire State” like sunny Ithaca in November. The high on game day is projected to be a balmy 36 degrees with partly cloudy skies and a slight chance of glacial formation.
Though Ithaca’s status as a viable, habitable city continues to baffle me, I have grown fond of Cornell football over the past few weeks. As recently as last week, the Big Red occupied the top spot in the Ivy League (despite having a losing record overall, but let’s not talk about that). With Yale now leading the way at 4-1, Cornell must win its next two contests to have a shot at the league crown.
The Big Red and Columbia enter with identical 3-2 records. Barring the wild and unlikely every-team-wins-the-league result that I mentioned earlier, the loser of this game will drop its title hopes, and the winner will be in prime position to claim a share of the throne.
Ever since Cornell’s week-four win over the Crimson, I have been convinced that the Big Red is the team of destiny in the Ivy League. Here is its chance to prove just that to legions of rapt followers from Buffalo to Ronkonkoma.
Pick: Cornell 17, Columbia 14
PENN AT HARVARD
Quakers, meet Puritans.
Historically, Harvard has been associated with Boston’s large contingent of Puritan settlers. Generally known as a cold and serious people, the Puritans’ reputation is nothing like that of their Protestant neighbors to the southwest—for instance, the Quakers’ official name is the Religious Society of Friends. Can’t get much friendlier than that.
These two groups can trace their origins to England, which makes me wonder: Would they not prefer a proper football match to a distasteful and barbaric display of American football? I’d imagine they would, so let’s switch up the terminology here.
When the two sides meet at Harvard’s pitch on Saturday, the result surely won’t be nil-nil. Nonetheless, it may prove to be a defensive showdown.
Penn limits opponents’ rushing attacks to four yards per attempt, and the Crimson may rely heavily on its ground game moving forward, as its quarterback situation is murky. The Quakers have to contend with Harvard’s hot hand—the Crimson defense has back-to-back impressive showings against league opponents. Realistically, you might need to be Sherlock Holmes to crack this case.
Harvard and Penn each must win, and each is coming off statement wins against tough opponents. The Quakers collapsed Princeton, 38-35, and the Crimson took down Columbia, 21-14. It’s not at all elementary, my dear (Justin) Watson.
However, I know the English would favor Harvard in the upcoming game, as this week the university named Elton John the 2017 Harvard Humanitarian of the Year. At the conclusion of play on Saturday, the Crimson will be able to say, “I’m Still Standing.”
Pick: Harvard 30, Penn 24
