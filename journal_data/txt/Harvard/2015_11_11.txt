After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a recent event with Black Lives Matter co-founder and all-around badass Alicia Garza, the organizer and powerhouse spoke tenderly to a room of activists about the idea of self-care.
I have done many a silly thing in the name of self-care. Freshman year, I probably ate dinner at the Panera across the street from my room in Wigglesworth as often as I ate in Annenberg. I was tired, it was cold, the Berg was far away. “Self-care,” I’d say, shuffling through the snow to shove cheese and bread into my sad, sad face.
This summer was tough. (Think: rough break-up, away from home, racism, overwhelmingly white internship.) In the name of self-care I took in a stray cat, did a lot of online shopping, took long walks during the workday, purchased expensive and mediocre coffee.
There’s probably something to be said here about balance. Self-care is easily abused. In reality, a lot of my indulgences in the name of self-care were financially and healthfully irresponsible, but made from very valid places. I have a chronic pain and fatigue condition, albeit a low-key one, so eating is hard and massively important, and it is in fact difficult to walk through the snow. Break-ups suck, cats do tend to make you feel less lonely. Racism is flattening and taking walks can help.
If I’m not making the need up, why does the fulfillment of that need often make me feel guilty, petty, and indulgent?
Part of the answer, as usual, is culture. Often, and especially here, we aren’t supposed to let ourselves feel. I did not schedule time in my G-Cal to cry today, and so today I will not cry. That person, who is one year older than me, practically a child, is in a position of power that I am vying for. So I will not ask them if they are okay. “I’m good, how are you?”
Perhaps that gets to Alicia Garza’s greater point. It shouldn’t be, she suggested, a question of taking care of one’s self, but instead a question of collective care—taking care of each other.
When it comes to oppression and activism, this reframing was revolutionary for me. Yes, you can go to the rallies, and share the articles, and do the work on the ground. Yes, you can be there for your friend’s actions, you can march together and canvas together and shout together. And you can take an extra nap today in the name of self-care. But who is making sure you are sleeping regularly? Eating? Getting home safe?
Systems can be crushing. But what’s under their overwhelming weight are not ideas, but individual people. In a video installment of the “What’s Underneath” series exploring fashion and identity, Alok Vaid-Menon, one-half of the poetry duo Darkmatter, spoke of the dangers of transphobia against trans-feminine folks. “When we go to the club, everyone’s going to be like 'Oh my god I love your outfit!' But no one’s going to ask us, 'How are you getting home?' They don’t care because they think trans-feminine people only matter when we’re fabulous...I would much rather know that y’all would, if someone was yelling at me on a train, say, 'Hey stop that,' versus, like, knowing my pronouns.” They share not only a lesson in allyship, but also a lesson in compassion, in care.
At Yale right now, students are coming together to march. At Mizzou, students are tearing a system down. Weeks ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, and around the country, students fought for an end to unjust fee raising and, more deeply, the transformation and decolonization of education systems. People keep saying that it’s 2015, but that it looks like 1960. Maybe it does. But it also looks like 2015. And I’m worried about myself, my friends, and my people, whom I love.
I had an outburst, studying in a circle with my friends the other night. Piercing the silent fervor, I sighed loudly, dropping the crumpled words, “I’m stressed out,” into the middle of the circle.
“About your plan of study?”
“About reading?”
“About your column?”
“No. Well, yes, but no.”
I’m stressed out about care. I wonder what it’ll take for Harvard students to surround an administrator for hours. I wonder what it’ll take for Harvard to earn a resignation. If we get there, when we get there, I wonder how we’ll care for each other, when, by and large, we seem to be a campus turned inward on ourselves. Garza was clear. Moments do not make movements. Organizing makes movements, and collective care is what must sustain that organizing.
I can practically hear the crusty old commenters rolling their eyes, cracking their fingers to parody and decry my SJW softness. I will admit it: I am soft. Soft enough to write this as a promise: There are some days when I am overwhelmed by how much I cannot do. But I will do better. I am soft enough to ask for help when I need it, soft enough to care for others how they want to be cared for, and soft enough to rejoice in and lift up this tenderness. I am soft enough to tear shit down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Google’s website, the “Our Culture” section explains the company’s culture: “Our offices and cafes are designed to encourage interactions between Googlers within and across teams, and to spark conversation about work as well as play.” In a sense, this almost sounds like a description of a company retreat rather than daily life in the office. The intention is to bring everyone together to build company community in order to produce the best work.
Phrases like this echo nowadays just about everywhere you go. We hear them in the College, the various student organizations, churches, sport clubs, schools, apartment buildings, offices, families, and friends. All of these sections of our social jungle use buzz-phrases promising community. They claim to “foster community” and allow us to “grow together.”
This vocabulary is meant to catch you, pull you in, and make you feel comfortable that there are people who will be there for you. There is a romantic nudge in these promises where community seems to solve all our problems. The people within your given community are destined to be your best friends.
But the reality is, community dwelling can be strikingly uncomfortable. The conversations at Google on a day-to-day basis, the ones left unreported on the website, may not always be the most amiable. Relationships are not always glamorous; they can be hard and humbling as people do not always get along. People disagree. People mess-up, drop the ball, and wrong each other.
In a recent BBC period series entitled, “Call The Midwife,” an order of Anglican nuns practice midwifery alongside their fearless nurse assistants, bringing new life into the very poor, decaying East End of London. There was one episode where the words of the main character speak to the unromantic realities of relationship. One New Year’s Eve, this quote took on a deeper meaning for me. It became more than words I simply admired as it transformed my understanding of what it means to really live among others.
That night my coworker said some very unkind things to another coworker who was also my best friend. Rude comments are never okay, and after the debacle, I was outraged. I planned to confront the offender. I thoughtfully envisioned myself exploding with angry axioms of why he acted horribly, had wronged my friend, and had wronged me.
But the next morning, my friend and I received an email of striking apology.
“I ruined an otherwise perfect night and I am truly sorry.”
This emailed breathed with honest remorse. Reading the apology of a person with his tail between his legs, the words from the nuns of the East End reprised in my mind:
“Perfection is not a polished thing. It is often simply something that is sincerely meant. Perfection is a job complete. Praise given. Prayer heard. It can be kindness shown, thanks of the dark. Perfection is what we discover in each other, what we see reflected back. And if perfection eludes us that doesn't matter for what we have within the moment is enough.”
My relationship with the offender and the offended grew after a moment of tension. I can’t really explain how or why, but it did. Imperfection sat in the midst perfectly good work and good times and it was unexpectedly uniting. I realized that my desire to inflict justice upon my fellow man, while not entirely wrong, was unnecessary. He knew he had been hurtful before I was there to convince him.
At the end of the day, we really are all human and full of paradoxes. We can be remarkably good, and remarkably horrible, sometimes within the same moment. When we live in community, when we are really looking, we will see not only the good and the bad in others, but more potently, we will see it in ourselves.
So even though they never tell us the whole story, advertisements of community are necessary to give us the vision that community is really good. But we must keep in mind that people will be people. They will fight and fall and fail. But the trick is: We need them and they need us. We yell at coworkers because we have a need to understand that there are dark places within ourselves that must succumb to light. We need to be the friend of an offended coworker so that we can be outraged and angry on their behalf, but also so we can experience the disarming and slightly terrifying reality of forgiveness.
You are needed, and you need. Be satisfied with that, but don’t be satisfied with simply surviving in community, not letting anyone know your true self. Go live among your community in whatever shape it takes and know that it’s not always going to be perfect or romantic, but as Dean Khurana has said many times, it can be transformative and good. And maybe that’s where the truth about perfection lies in the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Days before Halloween weekend, the Intercultural Affairs Committee at Yale, comprised of 13 administrators, circulated an email to students encouraging them to “take the time to consider their costumes and the impact [they] may have,” and suggesting that students shy away from costumes that their peers might read as offensive, racist, or culturally appropriative.
Soon after, Erika Christakis, Yale lecturer and associate master at Silliman College, composed a thoughtful follow-up email. Grounding her response to the first email in terms of her academic work on child psychology, she suggested that students wear what they liked, and work out with one another what costumes might be hurtful. In the intervening 10 days, some Yale students have called for Christakis and her husband Nicholas, the former master of Pforzheimer House, to resign.
Yale’s student protestors point to a string of racial incidents this semester at Yale, starting with swastikas that were found drawn outside a freshman dorm on Old Campus last October, and leading up to accusations that a member at the SAE fraternity turned dark-skinned students away from the group’s Halloween party.
It is impossible to take Christakis’ email outside the context of these dramatic events. But even still, they do not change the fact that both the deans’ and Christakis’ messages were appropriate. It is reasonable for the administration in a collegiate environment to encourage students to be mindful of each other and not go out of their way to offend each other, just as it is reasonable to point out that students are ultimately free to wear what they choose.
The question of race at Yale, and at most colleges, is a complex and painful one, and this editorial does not assume to offer a definitive survey. It certainly appears that much of the Yale student body considers the incident at SAE a symptom of an unacceptable racial status quo on campus. Yale President Peter Salovey, Dean of Yale College Jonathan Holloway, and the masters of Silliman were correct to hold dialogues with students about the email in the days that followed. It seems clear that the Yale administration can and must do more to create an environment where students of color feel welcome in the university.
But the possibility of fruitful dialogue is exactly what makes the out-of-proportion, disrespectful reaction to Christakis’ email so deeply disappointing. The students should have accepted the offer of more discussion, rather than meeting an outstretched hand with harassment and shouting.
Video clips, which appeared online late last week, show student protesters yelling and cursing. Yesterday, the Yale Daily News reported that several students protesting a visiting speaker, Greg Lukianoff, spat and cursed at several fellow students as they left the talk. While this behavior is not, of course, representative of a majority of the protesters, a pattern has emerged in which student outrage has taken increasingly aggressive forms.
Today Yale is in the spotlight—but hundreds of other colleges and universities across the country are undergoing their own equally dramatic conversations about race. Monday’s news from the University of Missouri that President Timothy M. Wolfe was stepping down in response to student dissatisfaction at his administration’s handling of racist incidents on campus is merely the latest example of the power of organized groups of students to effect dramatic change in the leadership of the universities they attend.
This is an awesome power, and protesting students must rise to the occasion and wield it responsibly and thoughtfully. Even as we wholeheartedly support those who want to make Yale, Harvard, and American universities in general more inclusive, we must protect our ability to speak freely about the changes that these protests have brought and are bringing.
This ability includes, on occasion, criticizing student protesters and the tactics they employ to achieve their goals. Couched in terms of shared ideals, this kind of criticism is not vilification, but the highest form of respect.

New York Times bestselling author Soman S. Chainani ’01 shared his experiences as a writer and discussed his children’s fantasy trilogy “The School For Good and Evil” on Tuesday during Folklore and Mythology 128: “Fairy Tale, Myth, and Fantasy Literature” in Harvard Hall.
Maria Tatar, the chair of the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, spoke of her relationship with Chainani during her introduction.
“Back in 1997, Soman was in my freshman seminar, and as you can imagine he was precocious, passionate, and irreverent,” Tatar said. “I knew he was destined for greatness, so I was not surprised when a few years ago I received a typed script of his book which was going to be published.”
Chainani spoke about how his childhood, and Disney movies in particular, influenced his interest in fairy tales.
“I think it was that jarring gap between the Disney movies I grew up with and the original stories they were based on that ultimately made me start to question what kids in the U.S. grow up with,” Chainani said. “This gap is what drove me to see if there was a way that I could spin a new kind of fairy tale that isn’t a retelling of an older one.”
Chainani, a former Crimson editor, said he always wanted to tell stories, but started out as a pharmaceutical consultant after graduating from Harvard. He then enrolled in a film program at Columbia before writing scripts full time in Hollywood.
“I ended up writing the treatment for a movie that then became a novel, that then became a screenplay,” Chainani said.
He believes that often, heroes and villains are essentially the same character, a concept he tried to highlight in his books.
“If you ever read a fairy tale quite closely, you’ll realize that neither are happy in their current condition, and both are looking for an identity outside of themselves,” Chainani said.
Prerna C. Bhat ’16, who attended the discussion, said that Chainani’s experiences were reassuring to students who are exploring unconventional career paths.
“As students who are trying to figure out what we want to do, hearing about a life path that wasn’t necessarily straightforward was really cool to have,” Bhat said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Referenda attempting to restrict undergraduate participation in all-male final clubs and looking to ban student breakfast meetings failed to make the ballot for the Undergraduate Council elections next week.
Only one of this year’s three non-UC sponsored referenda, asking students if Harvard should open up meetings of its sexual assault policy task force to all interested students, gathered more than the required 670 signatures to be placed on the ballot.
The question was submitted by Julia R. Geiger ’16 on behalf of advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better. In a previous interview with The Crimson, Geiger said that currently, very few students have a role in the activity of the policy task force, and that entirely student task forces are given little agency to change policy.
The final club referendum gathered 283 signatures, while the breakfast meeting question gathered only 115.
Alongside Our Harvard Can Do Better’s referendum question, a proposal asking students whether or not Pusey Library should be turned into a freshman-oriented social space will also be voted on next week. At the UC’s general meeting on Nov. 1, representatives voted with over two-thirds in favor to support the referendum, therefore bypassing the signature requirement.
According to the Council’s Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, the signature requirement for referenda, which equals roughly 10 percent of the student body, is high because ample student interest in a proposal needs to be demonstrated before it is brought before the student body at large during the presidential election.
During last year’s election, only one signature-requiring referendum made it to the ballot. The proposal, which attempted to limit section sizes to twelve students, was brought before the UC to eliminate the need to gather signatures, only to be voted down by the Council.

Diane Quinn will take on the role of executive director of the American Repertory Theater beginning Dec. 1, joining Diane M. Paulus '88, who will continue as the A.R.T.’s artistic director.
Most recently, Quinn acted as senior vice president of creative and artistic operations at Cirque du Soleil in Canada. Previously, Quinn has served as founding producer of Soulpepper Theater Company, Canada’s largest urban theater. She has also held roles as the coordinator of the arts administration program at the University of Toronto and executive director of Toronto Women in Film and Television.
Quinn graduated from the University of Toronto’s Honors Arts Specialist degree program with a concentration in Arts Management and Drama, and she wrote "The Indie Theatre Producer’s Guide.”
Steve Johnson, A.R.T. board chair, described the search for a new executive director as both “extensive” and “international” in nature in a press release. He and the board expressed faith that Quinn could “step in seamlessly” and “continue all of the extraordinary work of the institution.”
Quinn said that she looks “forward to continuing with the important work of this organization and the strong partnership with Harvard."
Quinn will be working with Diane Paulus, the current artistic director. During Paulus’ tenure, the A.R.T.’s Oberon, a club theater, has operated as an “incubator for local and emerging artists.”
Since its founding in 1980 by Robert S. Brustein, the A.R.T has worked closely with the Harvard’s theater community. The A.R.T is a central professional theater on Harvard’s campus, facilitating many students' entry into the theater world through an offering of internships and production assistant roles.

After opening its doors in mid-October, Harvard Square’s new Mexican eatery El Jefe’s Taqueria has aimed to distinguish itself from multiple culinary competitors in the Square.
El Jefe’s owner John Schall said he wants to create a higher quality dining experience by using fresh ingredients in his taqueria, which replaced The Taco Truck at the 83 Mt. Auburn St. storefront.
Schall, who is also owner of the Square restaurant Fire + Ice and a founder of the original Fire + Ice Franchise, added that El Jefe’s offers a simpler pricing strategy than many of its competitors.
“When you go into other taquerias, you never know exactly how much you’re paying because everything costs money,” he said.
“We’ve freed the guac,” Schall added, pointing to the fact that items added to a base meal, such as guacamole, are free.
In an effort to make a name for itself among several other Mexican restaurants in the Square, El Jefe’s keeps its doors open late, closing at 4 a.m. every day. According to Schall, the taqueria will also soon begin opening at 8 a.m. every morning to serve breakfast. Schall emphasized that both of these features are unique from other taquerias in the area.
He also noted that the burritos and Mexican bowls are the most popular dishes so far.
Some students said that they heard of the new taqueria through word of mouth. William A. Chang ’19 said some of his friends were talking about the new restaurant as a dining option with relatively shorter lines.
Maximilian J. Ubiñas ’17 said that he discovered the space by chance.
“I just saw it walking by,” he said, adding that the close proximity to the student Houses was a definite boon and that he enjoyed the tacos.
El Jefe’s Taqueria is also aiming to immerse itself more formally in the local community. Schall said that, starting in December, the eatery promises to donate a dollar for every burrito or bowl purchased during the second week of every month to Y2Y, a student-run homeless shelter that opened this weekend. Schall said he hopes to maintain an ongoing relationship to support Y2Y’s efforts.
When asked about future plans for his new restaurant, Schall said he prefers to concentrate on the present.

To commemorate Veterans Day, current Harvard students who have previously served in the U.S. Armed Forces led official “Harvard Military History” tours that centered on the University’s and its affiliates’ association to American wars.
Open and free to the public on the Saturday and Tuesday prior to the federal holiday taking place this Wednesday, the tour began in Harvard Yard at Wadsworth House, where General George Washington set up his first Massachusetts headquarters during the Revolutionary War, according to the tour.
Emerald Ralston, one of the tour guides and an Extension School student who has served in the Air Force, said she loves the opportunity to lead the tour because it gives visitors perspective on a group with which the University is not “normally associated.”
“It allows me to really embrace the veteran side of my Harvard experience,” Ralston said. “It’s important to embrace every demographic here on campus.”
According to Ralston, Harvard affiliates have served in every armed conflict in which Americans have been involved since King Philips’s War in 1675. In particular, the tour focused on Memorial Hall, which bears the name of over 100 Harvard associates who fell on behalf of the Union cause during the Civil War. The listed names included that of Class of 1859 member Robert Gould Shaw, an American soldier in the Union Army who commanded the first all-black regiment.
Ralston said she hopes those on the tour came away with a better understanding of the University’s military history.
“I learned more in this past week just giving this tour than I knew existed here,” Ralston said.
One tour group featured more than 20 people, mostly from across the country as well as a few from Sweden. Tourist Jennifer Tang, visiting from San Francisco, said she found out about the tour online.
“I didn’t know that there were so many graduates from Harvard that were so involved in the different wars,” Tang said. “I work for a defense company, so I’ve always been very proud to be American.”
The tour culminated with Ralston recounting the famous story behind the John Harvard statue—all records of him, including those revealing his appearance, were lost in a fire that burned down Harvard Hall. As a result, the John Harvard statue does not bear a true likeness to the person it honors.
“Now everything is online, and back in the day people had to take great care to preserve things,” Tang said. “It’s unfortunate that we don’t know what he looks like.”

UPDATED: November 16, 2015, at 12:22 a.m. 
Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow defended race-based affirmative action for law school admissions in an amici curiae brief filed for the the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin.
Counsel for Minow and Yale Law School Dean Robert C. Post ’69 filed the brief last week. Harvard has also submitted an amicus brief for the Fisher case offering similar pro-affirmative action argument. 
In 2008, Abigail N. Fisher—who is a white woman—brought a suit against the University of Texas at Austin after being denied admission alleging that Texas’s admissions department discriminates based on race. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that a lower court had failed to apply the proper standard of scrutiny in examining the university’s admissions policies. A circuit court then ruled in favor of the university, but Fisher appealed the verdict and the Court has decided to rehear the case, with oral arguments scheduled for December.
In 32-page brief, which was penned by their counsel, Minow and Post contend that law schools should continue to consider race as a factor in a holistic admissions process and that a ruling to the contrary would have “devastating” educational consequences.
“It is neither feasible nor desirable to ignore race in the evaluation of an applicant’s file,” the deans argue. "Later, it continues “It would be as arbitrary and misleading as ignoring an applicant’s college major or the quality of an applicant’s undergraduate training or whether English is an applicant’s first language.”
While the brief states that neither Minow nor Post represent the position of their respective law schools, its arguments supporting affirmative action are similar to those expressed by Harvard in its amicus brief from last week. Namely, Minow and Post argue that holistic admissions allow their schools to select the best students and create an effective learning environment.
“Each year, therefore, we aspire to assemble a student body in which the potential for students to learn from and with each other is maximized,” the brief reads. “This requires selecting a class in which students have different points of view, are committed to diverse aspirations, and have complementary strengths.”
This amici brief also comes as Harvard’s undergraduate admissions policies garner legal scrutiny. In a lawsuit filed last year, the anti-affirmative action group Project on Fair Representation accused the College of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The suit is currently on hold, pending the Supreme Court’s decision in the Fisher case.
Neither Minow nor Post are strangers to the Supreme Court. They each served as clerks to former Supreme Court justices, and, as Minow and Post make clear in their brief, each sitting justice on the Court attended either Yale Law or Harvard Law. Elena Kagan, Minow’s predecessor as dean of the Law School, has recused herself from the case.
During her six-year tenure as dean, Minow has shaped admissions standards at the Law School to emphasize less-quantifiable aspects of a student’s application, like work experience.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 16, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Elena Kagan will hear Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin this December. In fact, Kagan has recused herself from the case.

Authors of the book “$2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America” called for the creation of public sector jobs at the lowest levels of the economy and shared their insights on extreme poverty in America at the Kennedy School on Tuesday.
Co-authors Kathryn J. Edin, professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, and H. Luke Shaefer, associate professor of social work and public policy at the University of Michigan, shared anecdotes regarding the motivations of Americans at the poorest end of the economic spectrum to perform activities including trading food stamps, selling plasma, and trading sexual services.
Edin, who taught a course titled “Poverty and Social Policy” at the Kennedy School in 2010, mentioned her interest in returning to speak.
“The Kennedy School is full of world-changers, and when we organized our book tour, we needed this to be a spot. If you tell the Kennedy school audience something, it’s going to filter out,” Edin said.
David T. Ellwood ’75, a professor of political economy at the Kennedy School and one of the moderators of the event, praised the book for its portrayal of poverty in America. “In books like this, and this book in particular, it gives you a sense of how hard it is to be poor and how very smart you have to be to survive if you’re poor,” Ellwood said.
Members of the audience expressed their interest in learning more about poverty at the extreme end of the economic spectrum.
“In my academic career I’ve always been interested in research on poverty,” said Jessica H. Su, an assistant professor of sociology at SUNY Buffalo who attended the book talk. “I think they have uncovered a really important segment of the population that’s persistently poor and I really wanted to hear them talk about it.”

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 argued for the value and necessity of academic disciplines, while also encouraging interdisciplinary efforts, at the Mahindra Humanities Center’s second Provostial Lecture at Menschel Hall Tuesday evening.
Titled “Why Disciplines Persist,” the lecture followed an eight-year hiatus after the first Provostial Lecture, given by former University Provost Steven E. Hyman, a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, on “Compulsion and the Brain: Subverting the Concept of Self Control.” 
Garber spoke of the importance of academic disciplines in a liberal arts education, while also acknowledging the challenges they can face.
“Even broad, liberal arts educations require instruction grounded in disciplines,” Garber said. “Any discipline faces challenges. The challenges can be unsettling, but they’re necessary, ensuring that discipline does not become dogma.”
Garber described an ideal graduate school education as T-shaped, with deep knowledge in one field and broad knowledge in all fields.
“Our current discussions about both undergraduate and graduate education have reinforced the widespread view that our students should be educated both widely and deeply,” Garber said.
Garber added that disciplines can adapt to changing trends to enable them to stay relevant in society.
“[Disciplines] take in new ideas, they grow, they are pruned,” Garber said. “The changes in some fields in recent years are dramatic.”
Garber referred to recent changes in the life sciences at Harvard, the incorporation of genetics and computation into many disciplines, and the adoption of gender analysis into social sciences and humanities classes as examples of disciplines evolving.
Garber recounted his personal experience as a Harvard undergraduate and said that while he originally intended to concentrate in biochemical sciences, he took the introductory course Economics 10 and developed a new interest that would follow him to graduate school.
Although advised by a professor not to pursue both a Ph.D. in Economics and an M.D. because “the opportunity cost would be high,” Garber said, he ultimately obtained both degrees. 
“By falling into a discipline, I became part of a tradition,” Garber said.
In the question-and-answer session, a lecture attendee raised concerns about what he perceived as excess compartmentalization due to academic disciplines. Garber responded by acknowledging the imperfections of the system, but said that the benefits outweighed the costs.
For his part, lecture attendee Stephen H. Elliott, a graduate of Harvard Business School, also questioned the value of strict academic disciplines. Elliott said knowing various fields of knowledge was important, and achieving breadth would be more difficult in a system of very structured disciplines.
“When I came to try and study academically, it was impossible,” Elliott said, “I didn’t know what department I belonged in, I really don’t know where I should have gone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard started a formal review process for the construction project of its new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex, filing an Institutional Master Plan Notification Form with the Boston Redevelopment Authority on Monday.
The filing represents the latest development in the SEAS’s partial move to Allston, where two-thirds of SEAS faculty are expected to relocate as early as 2020. Many details in the plan reflect months-long discussions held between Harvard representatives, members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, and the Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee.
Following a thirty-day public comment period on the new filing, the BRA will release a document asking Harvard to clarify its plans and address issues raised by Boston officials and residents. Harvard then could amend and resubmit its master plan for approval. Construction on the project is slated to begin in the summer of 2016.
The planned complex has a tumultuous history: It was originally approved in 2007 to house the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, but construction halted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the site vacant and fenced-off.
In 2012, Harvard announced that it would resume development on the project by 2014, and now it is a focus of the University’s ongoing $6.5 billion capital campaign.
But the current project is markedly different than the original plan. The complex will now primarily house SEAS and will consist of one single building rather than four smaller buildings. Additionally, the complex’s projected square footage has been reduced from 589,000 square feet to 496,850 square feet.
Approximately 19,000 square feet of the facility will be public, including a large interior atrium with access to Western Avenue and first-floor retail and cafeteria facilities. Much of the building’s 209,000 square feet of dedicated laboratory space will be located above a two-story area of the complex, described in the filings as a “glassy ‘pedestal’ space that will infuse Western Avenue with transparency and activity.”
The filing also states that the proposed construction project now includes Harvard’s 114 Western Avenue property, and will have far less parking space than the 2007 project—about 275 spots on-site, compared to the previously planned 500 on- and off-site spots. The building’s new undergraduate and graduate occupants will thus need to rely primarily on Harvard’s shuttle service, biking, or walking for transportation, instead of driving.
Additionally, early last month, the Business School also filed plans with the BRA for a major Allston development project of its own— construction on its new Klarman Hall facility, which will house a 1,000-seat auditorium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s not much else to it: the Harvard football team has dominated Columbia over the last 13 years. The last loss to the Columbia football team came in 2003 with the Lions barely edging out the Crimson 16-13. Since then, Columbia hasn’t been able to touch Harvard. The biggest rout came from the 2012 season through last year.
The game this year, played at Robert K. Kraft Field in New York (ironic that the Lions’ home field is named after Boston’s premier sports magnate) was a little different, though. In the season that Columbia won its first game since 2012, the Lions are currently allowing a mere 20.9 points per game to opponents. Statistically, the game this year was a complete turn-around for Columbia.
POINTS 2015: Harvard 24; Columbia 16
POINTS 2012-14: Harvard, 49.3; Columbia 0
Since 2012, the Crimson defense did not let up a single point to the Lions until this year. However, the Lions’ boast the third-ranked defense in the Ivy League. They shut down the Crimson who currently average a league-leading 37.6 points per game. Columbia’s 16 points nearly doubles Harvard’s average of 9.5 points allowed per game.
TOTAL OFFENSE 2015: Harvard, 379 yards; Columbia, 404 yards
TOTAL OFFENSE 2012-14: Harvard, 487.7; Columbia, 206.3
Harvard, having more than doubled Columbia’s total yardage over the previous three contests, was outperformed by the Lion’s offense. The Harvard offense, which averages 475.6 yards per game, put up almost 100 yards less than normal.
POINTS OFF TURNOVERS 2015: Harvard, 3; Columbia, 3
POINTS OFF TURNOVERS 2012-14: Harvard, 24.3; Columbia, 0
Over the past three seasons, the Harvard offense was opportunistic when it came to turnovers by the Columbia offense. Half of the team's’ points came when the Lion’s gave the ball away. The closeness of this game can be directly linked to the lack of turnovers by each offense as well as the few points scored when either did turn the ball over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the end of midterm season (a.k.a. the entire fall semester) fast approaching, it’s time to celebrate! …with overdue essays, zero-degree wind chill, and the beginning of the finals grind.
Okay, so maybe it’s not time to kick back, and relax just yet.
But have no fear! There are a few things to look forward to: a Harvard-Yale victory (hopefully), Turkey break, and—as always—an abundance of fine tweets from even finer Crimson athletes. So, please, put down the Economics textbook for a few moments and instead enjoy some of the greatest tweets of the week, courtesy of Harvard Sports:
6. Kent Haeffner, sophomore, men’s swimming and diving
“That moment you get to class after a nap and realize you didn't put your contacts in #blind”
We’ve all had those days, Kent.
5. Jacob Luna, senior, men’s swimming and diving
“Today in psychopharmacology: cheese causes autism”
Kids, I present to you: Harvard.
4. Gabby Sims, sophomore, women’s swimming and diving
“When you can't decide what donut you want so you get three”
Please donut tempt me with your sweets…
3. Miye D'Oench, senior, women’s ice hockey
It makes no kind of sense that "playwrights" isn't spelled "playwrites"
Coming from a wrighter for the Crimson, I don’t get this either.
2. Molly Tissenbaum, junior, women’s ice hockey
I have a severe distrust of all people who order a small coffee in the morning... #why
So do we, Molly. So do we. #caffeineorbust
1. And finally…Harvard Athletics, with a picture of two bearded, identical-looking men:
“Twins or two great @harvardfootball QBs? Ryan Fitzpatrick congratulates @bshosch on the win over Columbia”
Will the real Fitzpatrick please stand up?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After creating some separation to start the second half, Harvard held off a late McGill comeback for a 66-­63 victory in Saturday’s exhibition game at Lavietes Pavilion. The Crimson was able to capitalize on its size advantage against an undersized McGill frontline. Harvard’s five big men combined for 41 points, with 34 of the team’s points coming in the paint.
FORCE DOWN LOW
With senior point guard Siyani Chambers out for the season, junior forward Zena Edosomwan has been highlighted by teammates as the focal point of Harvard’s offense. It was a tale of two halves for Edosomwan on Saturday.
In the first half, he was a man among boys, dominating in the paint and willing the Crimson to a seven-­point halftime lead with 18 points. After the break, McGill held Edosomwan to just three points on 1-­of-­3 shooting, but the 6’9” junior was able to find teammates on the perimeter and gather four second­ half offensive rebounds.
“One thing for me is just to be more assertive on the glass [with] offensive rebounds,” Edosomwan said. “I think just because I’m getting double teamed shouldn’t stop me from contributing in some way.”
Late in the first half, McGill adjusted its defense and Edosomwan began passing out of double teams. Freshman guard Corey Johnson benefitted the most from the attention inside, going 3­-of­-7 from beyond the arc after the break.
“Having Zena really opens things up for our shooters, not only myself but Corey and Corbin because you know he’s such a threat down low,” said freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy.
“He attracts so many guys that it’s easy to kick it out [for] wide open shots.”
QUESTIONS AT GUARD
The main question entering the game against McGill and the season in general was how would the team’s guard rotation shake up as Harvard tries to replace starting point guard and senior co­-captain Siyani Chambers. The answer did not become any clearer on Saturday.
Amaker had three different players–McCarthy and juniors Corbin Miller and Matt Fraschilla– run the point. Johnson received the lion’s share of the minutes at shooting guard. Miller, who saw significant minutes last year as the team’s top outside shooter, only played 15 minutes.
Defensively, Harvard’s guards struggled to consistently get stops. They were often caught in mismatches off of switches and the team’s forwards were extended to guard the perimeter. What McGill lacked in front court size, it made up for in backcourt quickness.
“You can see the quickness and the speed, or lack thereof...with our team versus other teams,” Amaker said. “McGill is a team that’s pretty quick on the perimeter. They’re really good with the ball and can make a play off the bounce. That’s areas that we’re not as good at right now.”
Meanwhile, to add to the uncertainty, sophomore guard Andre Chatfield was sidelined due to an injury.
The Harvard guard rotation took its most surprising turn with just over five minutes to go in the game and the Crimson up three. Fraschilla, whose last appearance of more than five minutes came against St. Rose last January, came off the bench to replace McCarthy after the freshman committed his third turnover of the game. The junior did not score but had an assist and, most importantly, zero turnovers.
“I thought [Matt] was a really big difference in us to win that game,” Amaker said. “I thought he made two really good decisions in the short time that he was on the floor.”
The last five minutes of the game were a mere subset of the many looks Amaker tinkered with on Saturday. He started with McCarthy, Johnson, and Okolie. He flanked McCarthy with Miller and Johnson, the team’s best shooters. Miller ran the point for a few possessions while McCarthy played off the ball. When Edosomwan left the game after a hard fall, Amaker went with the team’s three point guards­­Fraschilla, McCarthy, and Miller­­ to finish off McGill.
The tinkering did work, as the team ultimately held on for the victory, but it was not always pretty.
“We were very disjointed at times and we still need to be more efficient just in terms of our offense with shooting the three­point shots. Certainly the foul shooting was disappointing,” Amaker said.­

This Thursday is November 12, the deadline for sophomores to declare their concentrations. Cue the sound of stress-induced weeping in d-halls stretching from Mather to the Quad. But the Class of 2018 certainly has reason to be upset. Two weeks before the deadline, the team at my.harvard had failed to make the Declaration and Plan of Study Tools available to students.
Now, sophomores finally can access the Plan of Study tool on my.harvard, but it’s kind of the worst. Its layout is confusing and reminiscent of what the internet looked like circa 2000, and you have to look up and input the course ID number of each of the 20 courses you intend to take in your next two and a half years. On top of that, the process of declaring continues to be bogged down in my.harvard’s un-intuitiveness – Winthrop sophomores received an email today explaining the additional step of copying your Plan of Study after you fill it out but before you submit your declaration. If you’re confused, dear readers, you are certainly not alone.
But before you throw your hands in the air and accept your fate (and the inevitable ‘late declaration fee’ from the registrar’s office), Flyby has compiled some tips that might help you use the Plan of Study tool. At the very least, they probably won’t hurt:
1) Gather your blockmates and form a pentagram of empty beer cans on your common room floor. Chant Satanic verses until you have summoned a demon capable of fixing your IT troubles.
2) Repeatedly bang your head against your keyboard while you have the Plan of Study tool open. Hope that if you do this for long enough you will accidentally input your classes correctly.
3) Take a shot every time my.harvard does something you didn’t want it to do. After an hour, ask your roommate to please take you to UHS.
4) Send a frantic email to your sophomore advisor (make sure to overuse question marks). When you don’t receive a prompt reply, throw your computer from your window out of rage. Explain to your Residential Dean that you can’t declare a concentration without a computer.
5) Curl up in a ball and cry yourself to sleep. Try not to dream of Plans of Study.

We've gathered our staff together and racked our brains for the best things to use your BoardPlus on. If you are one of the lucky, lucky few who still has BoardPlus left, you are very welcome for our sage advice coming ahead in this series.

Greenhouse Cafe, Or, How I Ran Out of BoardPlus In September
I may not take any classes in the Science Center, but that doesn’t keep me from stopping by every day. Honestly, I think I spend more time in the Science Center now than I did when I actually had lectures there. My favorite part of the Science Center is Greenhouse Cafe (with being bombarded by pamphleteers coming in as a close second).
Some people may say there are fancier, hipper, more aesthetically pleasing places to spend your precious BoardPlus, and that might be true, but Greenhouse is my go-to BoardPlus stop regardless (or, that is, was, because I ran out so early in the semester). My Tuesday-Thursday schedule means I can’t get back to Lowell for lunch until 1 p.m., so I always go to Greenhouse for a mid-morning pick-me-up to take to my philosophy lecture.
The best thing about Greenhouse is that they have Diet Coke. Unlike all of the artsy cafes around campus, Greenhouse gives the people (me) what they want (so much diet coke). I’m not a coffee person, so this is my alternate source of caffeine, and I don’t know how places like Lamcaf or Barker Center Cafe think I can make it through any class or study session without it. There’s even this great deal where you can get 2 pieces of pizza, and add a large drink for only 79 cents, whoo.

We know, we know. We just posted about Greenhouse Cafe, but our staff has a lot to rave about it, so we present you with Part 2.5 of our series about the best places to use your BoardPlus:
Greenhouse Cafe, On Finding Pizza in a Hopeless Place
When looking for a place to spend my precious BoardPlus dollars, my standards aren’t very high. I don’t need some Wes Anderson soundtrack indie jams playing softly in the background– looking at you, Gato Rojo. I don’t need to see 50 acquaintances also procrastinating on psets, as in Lamont Cafe, nor do I need the aesthetic pleasure and pastries of Barker Cafe. (Barker Cafe also doesn’t have ice, and the temperature there never drops below 80 degrees. Unacceptable.)
Nay, when I am too lazy to walk back to Winthrop between classes, and when Fly-By just won’t cut it, Greenhouse Cafe is where I go. Greenhouse is dependable, accessible, and has never let me down. With a Starbucks cart out front, I know that I can always get my morning Chai Latte. Inside, I am met with a variety of food options: chicken tenders, burritos, Indian food, sushi...and pizza. Glorious, greasy, satisfying pizza.
Last year, Greenhouse Cafe pizza was the only thing keeping me from failing Physics 15b. I would grab a slice before lecture on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and on Wednesdays would replace an Annenberg dinner with a slice grabbed to-go en route to office hours. No, I did not prioritize my health above pizza as a freshman. No, this has not changed now that I am a sophomore.
This year, I often find myself in Greenhouse, grabbing pizza in the seven minutes between my Econ and Gov lectures. I firmly believe, and I think that the Greenhouse worker who consistently gives me the larger slice (thank you) would agree, that Greenhouse Cafe pizza may be the only thing keeping me sane in this cruel and unforgiving world. And for that, I would gladly spend all the BoardPlus in the world.

Flyby writers Eva S. Monroe ’18 and Ignacio Sabate ’18 have a lot of feelings, and they’re ready to share them. In Flyby’s newest series, these two sit down to discuss the more weighty topics on campus, like Bean boots, Pumpkin Spice Lattes, and how to get the best lighting for your Instagrams. Wait, that makes them sound really basic. You know what, ignore all of that, let them do the talking.
This week, Eva and Nacho take on the phenomenon of ‘cuffing season’ and the abomination that is PDA.
Nacho: Wait, so what even is cuffing season?
Eva: You haven’t heard of this? I feel like I see people complain about this on the internet all the time. And in real life.
Nacho: Nope.
Eva: Well, it’s this phenomenon where, when the weather starts to get cold, people seek out relationships. So as soon as the clock strikes November–
Nacho: That’s not how clocks work.
Eva: People just suddenly, like, pair up. It’s supposed to be like handcuffs, like you’re handcuffing yourself to someone for the winter because you don’t want to be cold. You want to have someone to cuddle with without having to go through a lot of effort.
Nacho: Maybe it’s like, an evolutionary response? Like in the winter you want to have more warmth in your bed.
Eva: I think when people were still evolving they didn’t have beds yet.
Nacho: Fine, in your cave, whatever. But I feel like it’s annoying to be cuffed to someone during the winter, because you have to travel to visit them. Why not just be single and not travel? Like, what if your significant other lives in the Quad. Would you visit them in the middle of February?
Eva: But then you’re cold. Wait– you know those weird creepy body pillows? Do you think they make those but with heaters inside so they’re warm? Like body heat? Does that exist?
Nacho: Umm, Eva, that’s really weird… That’s also actually a really good idea.
Eva: I’m going to be rich.
Nacho: But wait– cuffing. Does other people being in a relationship affect you?
Eva: Yeah, if they’re in my face about it. Get a room! But I’m super single so maybe I’m just jealous.
Nacho: Oh, yeah, PDA is a no-no. Like, I see that and I’m like, do better. I could do better.
Eva: You compare yourself to random boyfriends?
Nacho: Maybe… But I think you’re right. I think I’m more likely to be in a relationship in the winter. I guess that’s legit. Do you think that’s true?
Eva: I don’t think I have enough evidence to make a real claim either way.
Nacho: I mean, I think there’s sufficient evidence, at least when we’re talking about me. I feel like cuffing season happens to me, now that I think about it.
Eva: What about other people though? It’s not just about you.
Nacho: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Barker Cafe, A Non-Pretentious Review (I Promise)
Barker Cafe, the mecca for English professors, gawky TFs, and hipsters that think occupying an entire table and not purchasing something is okay.
After re-opening last year due to renovations, Barker is back. Considering the fact that I spend a minimum of eight hours at this cute little home for everything that is humanities, I feel especially qualified to comment on Barker.
First off, the coffee:Drinks are only marginally more expensive than other coffee shops on campus, but far better. Barker uses beans from Counter Culture Coffee, a bean producer whose website has words like “sustainable,” “transparency,” and "Honduras"— good start, then. It even has social media icons on the bottom of the page so you can let your 1,500 close Facebook friends know just how much you care about coffee growers on the other side of the planet.
The coffee itself is pretty good. The drip coffee doesn’t have too clean or glowing of a taste, but it’s passable. Their espresso coffee suffers a similar problem: it tastes a little agricultural and lacks crema. Of course this coffee beats dining hall coffee (which I think tastes like cigarettes, yuck), but these brews can’t compare to other coffee shops in the area, such as Pamplona, Algiers, or Crema– but you also can’t use BoardPlus at those locations. One can only dream.
The decaf coffee just underperformed. I didn’t even think to try the tea— why spend your precious BoardPlus on tea when you can make that in your own dorm?
7/10
Next, food:Barker really shines in this respect quality-wise. They get their food from Hi-Rise and they like to switch up their offerings pretty regularly, giving me an excuse to splurge more often than I should. However, there’s a caveat: it’s going to cost you a pretty penny. Why would you pay upwards of $8-9 on a merely okay sandwich?
4/10
Last, ambiance:Barker is the only campus BoardPlus location that really has any of it. This place is beautiful during the afternoon. The cascading yellow sun the pours into the rotunda and the low-tempo music played quietly from behind the counter gives me the will to finish my readings.
The only way you could improve the ambiance is by having puppies roaming around.
9/10.
Well done, Barker. Overall: 8/10.
