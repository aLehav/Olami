After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The death penalty has gotten quite a bit of press of late, most recently as a result of Oklahoma's botched execution of Clayton Lockett in April. But, as a New York Times opinion feature pointed out earlier that month, capital punishment has been declining in frequency for years now.  Between 2007 and 2013, six states  abolished capital punishment through legislation, often citing its cost, its documented racial bias, the possibility of executing an innocent person, and its ineffectiveness. Still, 32 states  maintain death penalty statutes, and as executions like Mr. Lockett's show, it can have horrific results.
A look at how Massachusetts, a liberal state whose population actually resisted the abolition of capital punishment in the early 1980s, finally rid itself of the death penalty is instructive for why states like Oklahoma continue to have trouble joining the rest of the developed world on the issue. In 1980, in the case District Attorney of Suffolk County vs. James Watson, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that, “in light of contemporary standards of decency,” and “the arbitrariness and discrimination inherent in the application of capital punishment,” the death penalty was a "cruel" punishment that ran afoul of Article 26 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, which forbids "cruel or unusual" punishment.
This ruling led Massachusetts voters to approve a 1982 amendment to the Commonwealth's Constitution reading, in part, “no provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution ‘shall be construed as prohibiting the imposition of the punishment of death.'" The legislature then quickly passed a bill, signed by conservative Governor Ed King, re-establishing capital punishment.
In 1984, however, in Commonwealth vs. Abimael Colon-Cruz, the SJC again invalidated the Commonwealth's death penalty. As it turned out, the law passed hastily after the 1982 referendum was poorly written, and conflicted with a United States Supreme Court precedent set 16 years earlier in United States v. Jackson. As the SJC's four-to-three majority explained, because defendants could only receive a death sentence if they were tried by a jury, and not after a guilty plea, the statute "impermissibly burden[ed] a defendant's right against self-incrimination and his right to a jury trial." In other words, the law gave criminal defendants a perverse incentive to forgo their constitutional rights to spare their lives. Since Colon-Cruz, Massachusetts has been death penalty free.
What makes this history noteworthy is the key role the judiciary played in pulling Massachusetts toward abolition. As the dissenting justices in the case wrote, the Court had chosen to ignore the express will of the people and invalidate a penalty that Massachusetts citizens had inserted into the Commonwealth's Constitution. In a state with appointed and not elected judges, however, a majority of the SJC had the independence to uphold the principles underpinning the criminal justice system despite the opinion of a majority of voters. Yes, the legislature helped by writing a grossly inadequate statute, but the SJC only struck it down by one vote, a testament to how unpalatable it is for even appointed justices to void the people’s decisions.
Now back to present day Oklahoma. What makes the useless suffering which Mr. Lockett endured at the hands of the state most unfortunate is that it came after both he and the man due to be executed after him, Charles F. Warner, had appealed their executions on the grounds that the method was unconstitutional. In what turned out to be a prescient warning, the men's lawyers argued that, because Oklahoma was keeping the “lightly-regulated” source of the drugs, a compounding pharmacy, a secret, the condemned had no way of knowing whether their executions would be humane or not.  Mr. Lockett's, of course, was far from it; and though the heinousness of his crime makes Mr. Lockett's death far from a tragedy, his execution exemplified the type of cruelty that the criminal justice system seeks to punish, not replicate.
A truly responsible Oklahoma Supreme Court, one like the Massachusetts SJC in 1984, would have stayed the men's executions until the State had revealed the source of the drugs and after the procedure's efficacy had been established. After all, other executions with untried drug cocktails have caused visible pain, and the idea that Oklahoma's cobbled-together method could pass constitutional muster is ludicrous on its face. Seeing such reasoning from an Oklahoma bench is probably wishful thinking–though a lower court had sided with the condemned men.  At the very least, however, the State Supreme Court owed Mr. Lockett and Mr. Warner, to say nothing of all Oklahomans with an interest in upholding the rule of law, a decision.
As the New York Times writes, however,  Mr. Lockett and Mr. Warner instead met a “Kafkaesque legal maze,” as neither the Oklahoma Supreme Court nor the Court of Criminal Appeals would issue them a stay of execution so that the issue of drug secrecy could be decided. And when the Oklahoma Supreme Court finally did issue a stay, Governor Mary Fallin said she would ignore it and one State Representative “said he would seek to impeach the justices.” The Oklahoma Supreme Court eventually ruled against Mr. Lockett and Mr. Warner, but the pressure from outside forces was unmistakable.
In short, the process that led to another bad mark on America's capital punishment record could not have been more different from the one that eliminated the practice in Massachusetts. Instead of principled jurists acting within a system that insulated them from politicking, in Oklahoma, indecisive judges acting within a system of retention elections tried to avoid making the responsible decision.  Until states like Oklahoma reform their systems to encourage more constitutional analysis and less politics, or until the U.S. Supreme Court acts decisively on current death penalty practices, state court systems will not be a locus of meaningful death penalty reform.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to Bloomberg Magazine, over 15 percent of the class of 2013 went to work for Wall Street, down from an incredible high of almost 50 percent in 2007. Goldman likes their Ivy Leaguers, and so they should. Anyone smart enough to get into Harvard can beat the market, right? Well… not really. The lure of money on Wall Street was, and still is, simply overpowering. Any educated psychologist knows how devastating gambling addiction can be, but no one really thinks of the people in the perfectly-tailored suits and shiny leather shoes as possible sufferers. Most societies view investing as the most socially acceptable form of gambling, and a job in the finance sector carries significant social prestige and signifies a high level of education. When people think of gambling, we imagine nine-to-fivers wasting away their life-savings at the blackjack table.
However, there is not much that separates stock-trading for profit from horse-racing. Based on past experience and performance, one chooses what he thinks will be the best option and bets money on it in hope of monetary gain. Even the smartest bankers are not impervious to the perils of money addiction. Multiple studies have shown that those addicted to money show similar brain damage to those addicted to cocaine. In an even more disturbing study, psychiatrists in Switzerland took day traders from major banks and clinical psychopaths and had them take the same personality tests. Surprisingly, bankers showed the exact same destructive traits that characterized psychopaths. Extreme competitiveness, aggression, lack of empathy–it was all there. In an editorial earlier this year in the New York Times, former Goldman-Sachs millionaire Sam Polk wrote about his years on Wall Street, and came to one simple conclusion, declaring, “I see Wall Street’s mantra — ‘We’re smarter and work harder than everyone else, so we deserve all this money” — for what it is: the rationalization of addicts.” As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman said, people don’t realize when they are acting irrationally. That is, we are blind to our own blindness. And in Wall Street’ case, money blocks out the Sun.
Before the financial crises of 2008, the bull run in the market seemed like it could last forever. Anything could be turned into a profitable security, from student loans to subprime mortgages. Clearly, that all changed very quickly, and government regulators have been trying their hardest to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. But the devastation that the crisis in 2008 left in its wake puts serious questions on the table when it comes to the bankers who thought they had the risk under control. Was the money in the short term really worth all the losses sustained during the crisis? And the frightening answer is, yes actually it was. The psychological evidence of the effects of money on the brain is damning. Bankers aren’t nearly as invincible as their bonuses make them feel, and the crash in 2008 was a rude illustration of that vulnerability.
Now, don’t let any of this dissuade you or your friends from taking that six-figure offer from a bank that you’ve been praying for all recruiting season. But be smart once you get there. The free market principles that have led to America’s global economic dominance remain intact. Unfortunately, nothing as complex as the trading that goes on in investment banks can be perfect. Money is even more powerful then you think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I just saw my psychic. I call her my psychic not because I see her regularly, but because the only way I’ll ever feel justified in paying her sixty dollars for a half hour of predictions is if I can also refer to her with the first person possessive.
My psychic is a fraud. Do not see my psychic.
She works on the fifth floor of a building on Tremont Street, where half the stores are pawnshops and the other half are boarded up. Her business is somehow solvent, but it could also just be a front.
My psychic is very pretty. She self identifies as a creative type, but I don’t know what that means. She is slender and blonde, and is covered in tattoos and cheap costume jewelry. I have only come to see her because a friend had invited me, and because I love card tricks. I’m hoping that she will do the trick where the card was in my wallet the whole time. But she doesn’t. She just tells me to pick three cards and then stares blankly at them.
After a long sigh— which at her rate costs a quarter—she looks up from the cards. Instead of explaining what they mean, which I am paying her to do, she asks me a series of questions: Where am I from? Where do I go to school? Is there anything I can tell her to make her job easier?
Initially, I am eager to tell her about my life. I think that maybe if I tell her enough she will double as my psychologist, and this will make up for the exorbitant rate she charges.
Then she begins to interpret the cards. She holds up what she says is the “family card,” but what is actually just a drawing of a unicorn in a waterfall.
“I’m sensing conflict,” she says, “Do your brothers tease you?”
“No.” I say, “They do not.”
“What about in the past—did they ever tease you in the past?” I say sure, because she looks visibly upset over the prospect of a three by five paper card with a mystical animal on it not accurately portraying my relationship with my siblings.
“Yes. That it what the cards are sensing.” she moves onto the next card, as if that was a satisfying prediction. “So you want to be a writer, but you study government?” This is true. I’m impressed—she remembered what I told her five minutes earlier.
She thinks for a moment, as if contemplating something morally ambiguous. The plastic bangles on her wrist jingle as she toys with my card. “I know it might be difficult,” she finally says, “but you should stay in school.”
This is good advice, and I appreciate it. However, I have no intention of dropping out of Harvard with only one year to go. I tell her this, and she agrees. “Yes, stay in school. After you will become a successful writer. What kind of writer do you want to be?”
“Any.”
“Like a playwright?”
“Probably not.”
“TV?”
“Sure.”
“Yes! The cards see you writing a television show. You will probably live on the East Coast, or the West Coast,” she continues, “but not in the middle. Now pick three more cards.”
She frowns at my cards. This is disconcerting, and I am worried that one of the cards that looks like a baby on a horse to me is actually the tarot card of death.
“No,” she says, “You do not have a brain tumor. The cards just want to talk more about your family. I sense that your brother is going to get married soon.”
I laugh, slightly out of relief but also because neither one of my brothers is even in a relationship. I tell her this.
“Is it possible that one of your brothers hasn’t told you about his girlfriend because he is in a secret relationship?”
I nod. Theoretically, it is possible.
“It’s that then!” She beams, “I predict that he is going to surprise you with his engagement.” She moves on.
“I’m seeing lots of boys,” she continues. “Not in your future. Your brother’s, they are going to have lots of sons. You, however, you will be single for the rest of college.”
I’m laughing now, hysterically. I am angry, not because I am going to be alone for another year (or forever, depending on the length of my graduate program) but because I could have told her this. In fact, I probably did. I had basically told her everything that she had predicted.
I was paying to have someone listen to my life and then reconfigure it into something that could apply to a card with a picture of a forest on it. She was just an under qualified psychologist, or an overpriced mirror. I guess that this is the true mystical power of the psychic: listening comprehension.
I tried to blame myself. I wanted this to be a PSA about over sharing, and about how when we are too eager to share our lives with strangers—via iPhone apps, editorial articles, and small talk with psychics—we make it too easy for people to impersonate soothsayers and rip us off. But this is not true. This is not my fault. This is not Twitter’s fault! My psychic is just a fraud. Imagine how vague my reading would have been if I had given her no information with which to work with. She probably would have just told me that I had green eyes. Even that’s not true; they’re hazel!
No. There is only one conclusion that comes from this. Never pay to see a psychic. If you want to see a card trick, go to a magic show, and if you want someone to tell you to stay in school, call your mother, or, just ask anyone really, any stranger on the street.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month later, America is still recovering from Elliot Rodger’s Memorial Day weekend massacre, in which he killed six people, injured thirteen others, and took his own life. Many Americans have already brushed off this shooting spree as an isolated incident, and dismissed Rodger as some crazy loner. However, it is important we not leave off on the matter so suddenly. Though his actions were extreme, Rodger’s overall attitude toward women–his feeling of entitlement to their bodies–is indicative of a strong current of misogyny on American college campuses.
Though only two women died at his hands, Rodger’s actions were driven by a rapacious sexism. “I don’t know why you girls have never been attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it,” he said in a YouTube video uploaded fewer than 24 hours before the massacre. Further investigation into his Internet history has revealed that he frequented male supremacy websites, leaving a virtual paper trail marked by prejudice. “It’s been my life struggle to get a beautiful, white girl,” Rodger posted in one online forum. He also wrote and uploaded a 140-page manifesto in which he chronicled his life-story and futile attempts to “win” a mate.
Recently, activists on several campuses have begun a dialogue on sexual violence in college, bringing this matter to national attention. After The Crimson published an op-ed from a sexual-assault survivor and the advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better filed a Title IX complaint against the university, we have learned that our school is very much part of the problem.
This sexual assault epidemic did not develop in a vacuum. We know where it started:  with men’s attitudes toward women.
When the modern women’s rights movement began at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, activists had to prove women were just as human as men. Fortunately, our society now views women as equal citizens. Nonetheless, we still must fight the prevailing belief that men possess some sort of right to women’s bodies.
It is no coincidence that Rodger was a college student. As an undergrad, he lived in a world where one in four of his female classmates would experience sexual assault, where few administrators would be sympathetic to or even believe their stories, where only a tiny fraction of their rapists would ever see so much as the slightest punishment for their actions. As an American male, he lived in a world where he was told that women exist for his sexual gratification, and that their rejection of him warrants a death sentence. Not every frat bro is a potential mass-murderer. Nonetheless, Rodger’s determination to deprive women of sexual choice outlives him.
As a feminist, I continue to be shocked but not surprised when I hear of things like this. The Santa Barbara shooting was a terrible tragedy that nobody could have predicted, but it is not unfathomable. In my activism these past few years, I have seen the frightening extent of discrimination, prejudice, and hate directed toward a full half of the world’s population simply because they are women. It is events like these that make my belief in the necessity of women’s rights activism even stronger. Yes, women are in possession of much more equality than they ever had at any point in history, but there is still a long way to go until we attain a completely egalitarian society. A mass murder that was so transparently fueled by misogyny, such as this one, just comes to prove it. As comforting as it would be to put our heads in the sand and pretend like everything is fine, it’s not, and it is imperative that we come to terms with that.
It would be unfair to Rodger’s victims, to survivors of rape, and to women at large if America allows Rodger go down in history as a nice guy who just snapped one day. As people who care about the welfare of society and safety of womankind, we cannot forget what motivated his actions. Misogyny kills. As college students living in a world where a quarter of our female friends will experience sexual assault, this lesson is doubly important.
As important as it is to raise awareness, we cannot simply give lip service. Rather, we must do our part to end the pervasiveness of misogyny in American culture. We have to speak up, intervene, and otherwise show that we abhor sexism and will not tolerate expressions of it in our presence. It is unlikely that one person alone will be able to erase misogyny from the world, since it is so deeply entrenched into our culture. However, if we all dedicate ourselves to calling it out when we experience it, maybe we will stop some of the other Elliot Rodgers – from those who inhabit the dark corners of the Internet to those who swagger around on our campuses – from committing further atrocities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside of the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston last Wednesday to advocate for the unionization of the hotel’s workers. Many on hand noted that the rally was by far the largest yet in support of the workers.
The protesters included hotel employees, Harvard students, Cambridge city councillors, and hundreds of visitors who were in Boston for a convention of UNITE HERE!, the labor union that DoubleTree workers are seeking to join. The union already represents many of Harvard’s dining hall workers.
While the hotel is not operated by Harvard, it is located in a building it owns, causing many protesters to direct their criticism at the University.
“What Harvard is doing, hiding behind essentially a subcontractor and saying that they do not have responsibility in this matter, is in my opinion completely wrong and cowardly on their part,” Cambridge City Councillor Marc C. McGovern said.
In April, the Cambridge City Council voted unanimously to support a boycott of the hotel and to back the workers’ efforts to unionize using a process that involves the open signing of authorization cards that state an individual wishes unionize. Hilton has thus far has insisted that employees vote through a secret ballot election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board.
Protesters said they hoped that it would bring attention to the what they consider the lack of a fair process being offered to workers.
“We think that Harvard on campus has some of the best labor relations and contracts around,” said Gabriel H. Bayard ‘15, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement. “DoubleTree workers deserve the same respect that workers get on campus, and we’re here to fight for it.”
Bayard and other activists contended that the secret ballot proposal allows management to manipulate the votes of workers by only scheduling anti-union workers for shifts on voting day and scheduling meetings to intimidate individual workers.
“I think you see a lot of people disenfranchised in certain voting practices,” Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said. “I think its important when you see this big showing that management recognizes the right of workers to organize in specific ways.”
Though the protest and hotel are located across the river from Harvard’s Cambridge campus, protesters and union leaders said that the University still has a responsibility as the hotel’s landlord to aid the employees.
Janice Loux, executive vice president of UNITE HERE!, said that the union took time from its conference to protest at the hotel “to help the Hilton workers and to fight Harvard.”
“It’s unconscionable that Harvard has not settled this issue,” Loux said. “They have a commitment to helping those less fortunate than themselves. Where I come from, the landlord is always in charge.”
Though protesters urged Harvard to intervene in support of the workers’ unionization efforts, University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke maintained that the University will support whichever voting process the hotel management and employees agree to.
“Harvard has no role in discussions between the Hilton Corporation and the employees working at The DoubleTree,” O’Rourke wrote in an email. “Harvard is proud of the strong relationship we have with our own unionized employees and currently has seven collective bargaining agreements covering nine unions.”
The hundreds of protesters assembled at Wednesday’s rally included labor leaders and union members from all over the country, as well as Canada. Nia Crenshaw, a UNITE HERE! worker from Detroit, said that similar issues have arisen a Detroit DoubleTree that the AFL-CIO has decided to boycott.
“We’re just here for solidarity and support,” Crenshaw said.
A manager at the Doubletree Hotel declined to comment.

Former Canadian opposition leader Michael G. Ignatieff will become the Edward R. Murrow Chair of press, politics, and public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, the school announced last Tuesday in a press release.
Before coming to Harvard as a professor of practice in 2012, Ignatieff served as a member of parliament and rose to lead the Canadian Liberal Party, but lost his seat in the 2011 elections after his party’s worst election showing in history. Before running for office in 2005, Ignatieff served as director of the Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
"The Kennedy School is an exciting and dynamic place where our future leaders are engaged in the very real process of gaining a greater understanding of the challenges they will face and the tools they will need to confront them," Ignatieff said in the press release. "I am thrilled to join the full time faculty at HKS and to serve as an affiliate of the Shorenstein Center."
Ignatieff declined to comment further.
At the Kennedy School, Ignatieff will also serve as the faculty affiliate at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, where he will conduct research and assist the fellows program, according to the announcement.
Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center, said that the Center looks forward to learning from Ignatieff’s unique experience in both politics and journalism.
“He is one of the true moral voices in the world of public intellectuals,” Jones said. “He is already very well-known and very well-integrated…. I think he considers the Kennedy School home.”
Ignatieff is the author of 17 books, and became known as a television broadcaster and journalist during his time in the United Kingdom from 1978 to 2000. He led BBC 2’s discussion program “Thinking Aloud,” and the arts program “The Late Show.” Additionally, Ignatieff wrote an editorial column for The Observer, a British Sunday newspaper.
In addition to his work at the Kennedy School, Ignatieff has also held a professorial appointment at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto before earning a Ph.D in history from Harvard.
