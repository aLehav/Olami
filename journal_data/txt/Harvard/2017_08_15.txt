After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, the Department of Justice announced an investigation into Harvard’s use of affirmative action in admissions, citing unfair discrimination against white and Asian students. In response, several articles criticized the announcement as white exploitation of some Asian Americans’ frustrations with college admissions, viewing it as a questionable alliance around the elimination of race-conscious policies.
Driven by sympathy for the concerns of the Asian community, many of the articles cautioned that backing by white opposition groups should be viewed with suspicion and replaced with narratives contextualizing the unique Asian experience. The underlying message is that Asians who oppose affirmative action should be able to express their criticisms in ways that are not manipulated by anti-black divide-and-conquer strategies. Alas, this is a tall order that requires collective myopia and a dismissal of both the history of affirmative action and the Asian community’s contributions to its racial politics.
When I and my other black classmates were accepted into elite colleges, cries of injustice rang out just as strongly from Asian classmates as white ones. In what has become a perverse rite-of-passage for many black students in my position, I endured whispered complaints that I was taking someone’s “spot.” Implicit in the outrage was the sincere disbelief that of 35,023 Harvard applicants worldwide, there could exist even a couple hundred black applicants who truly merited admission. There is a word for that: “racism.”
Frankly, there is a significant portion of the Asian community who believes that people like me are getting the upper hand in college admissions. This is despite the reality that, 50 years after affirmative action was introduced, African Americans are rarely accepted into colleges at rates reflecting their fraction of the population.
Blacks and Asians make up 13.3 percent and 5.7 percent of the US population, respectively. In contrast, my incoming class was 11.5 percent black and 19.9 percent Asian. Still, in 2014, the Silicon Valley Chinese Association successfully mobilized to defeat a bill proposing to restore affirmative action in California’s public universities. The following year, 64 Asian organizations formed the Asian American Coalition for Education to file a complaint against Harvard for denying admissions to Asian American applicants while accepting comparable applicants of other races. The resulting case is at the heart of the Department of Justice’s recent directive.
The retort is that Asian Americans’ dissatisfaction with race-conscious admissions should be seen as distinct from Abigail Fisher-esque anger because of their unique social position. In this view, rather than bemoaning change to the old segregationist order, Asian American activists are simply advocating for a pure meritocracy that would assumedly increase Asian representation at the expense of less-qualified members of other racial groups. Ironically, however, this perspective is inextricably linked to the anti-black backlash that affirmative action has received since its implementation. Indeed, the model minority myth was constructed as a counter to the Civil Rights Movement.
Affirmative action is one of the few reparative gestures ever made to America’s perennial underclass. The policy was conceived to remedy systematic exclusion of African Americans from higher education and portions of the workforce. In a speech at Howard University, President Lyndon B. Johnson, an architect of affirmative action, exposed the issue with arguments that African American underrepresentation was the regrettable but fair product of blind meritocracy at work. He famously remarked, “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, ‘You are free to compete with all the others,’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” Thus, rather than a nod to fairness in the abstract, affirmative action was imagined as a necessary provision to address crimes America tries its best to forget.
Of course, despite the successes of affirmative action, African Americans still face disadvantages in virtually all aspects of society. Stereotypes of intellectual inferiority, economic discrimination, the school-to-prison pipeline, and many other factors construct an unparalleled achievement barrier. Further, like all overtures to atone for slavery and segregation’s effects on African American prosperity, affirmative action has acted more as a rising tide than a reparation, helping additional groups in some cases more than African Americans. White women are its chief beneficiaries in the workforce, for example. Thus, critiques that affirmative action discriminates against whites and Asians to benefit the undeserving are blind to the goal of affirmative action and how its benefits have been distributed.
Discussions about race-conscious admissions are negligent if not tethered to the racist history that necessitate them. No argument is free of the politics that long deemed African Americans “unqualified” by dint of their skin—no matter the color of the group advancing it. Surely some aggrieved white Americans insincerely use the Asian American cause to further their own; however, until Asian American opponents of affirmative action incorporate historical realities into their own notions of fairness, their historical positions as tools of division will not solely be the fault of white people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a year ago, I filled some boxes and lugged them up five flights of stairs. It wasn’t a big deal or anything—I was just leaving my friends, family, and anything I ever considered home back in New Jersey and welcoming four white walls and a sloped ceiling as a shoddy substitute for the word, the feeling. The ceiling paint was chipping, the skylight dark. Four new roommates filled in the slots of the four people I left three states away. Sooner than I thought, those walls were decorated, the skylight waxed and waned bright, and those four people became much more than just strangers.
And for a long time, I tried to avoid calling that place home. It was the room, the dorm, my bed. It was like when you tell someone not to think of an elephant and they begin describing a gray hide, a snaking nose, ivory tusks under flapping ears—but deny the image its rightful name. A portrait without a frame, if you will. My home had always been my little green room of five paces by two, nothing more, nothing less. Yet, my will eventually caved. We took a group picture. I bought a frame. Weeks sprouted roots, months began to grow under the skylight, and soon enough I had to change my idea of what was home, or how many homes one could have without the word losing its weight.
But the gates around my new home were wrought iron, and the benches outside it rusting and remorseless. Although I had been lucky enough to find a home within the Yard, many are not so fortunate. Dotting the periphery of the University are a plethora of people who didn’t share my luxury of four white walls or a pointed roof above their heads. They have the clothes on their backs, miscellaneous personal items strewn about them, some with blankets during the winter, some without. While I was focusing so much on my process of accepting another home, some struggled to do the same.
At first, I regarded the rampant homelessness around Harvard as a fact. The walls were brick, the chairs rainbow, and the benches were home to people without a home. I walked to classes and jostled my focus whenever I passed, fearful too much attention would be considered staring and rude.  Ignoring it altogether would be to merely accept the problem and do nothing about it. Neither solution felt like a solution. I was reminded of the period of homelessness in my own family history, and shuddered at the juxtaposition.
One night in late October, a friend bought a sandwich from CVS and gave it to the man sitting across from the store, leaning against the street sign on the sidewalk. No questions were asked, few words were exchanged between the two. His outstretched hand was an opportunity and the man’s eyes were acceptance. I had never felt a wave of humanness like that before.
I learned how to balance my focus. It was with the alarm blaring under my pillow at six in the morning, the cold laying its bare hands on my cheeks, that  I raced across the Yard every Friday to the Y2Y shelter for a three hour shift making pancakes and eggs that the guests were tired of. We tried french toast for a change. The change worked. One of the guests, a regular, started singing Fetty Wap as he ate the new food. I left the shelter at nine, walking through the gates and passing the same inhabited benches, wondering if change is like a forest fire—if it could start and spread and turn everything anew.
At Harvard, we’re learning to look at the situation of homelessness in a more constructive way. The necessity of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter gave way to the creation of Y2Y in 2012. Both organizations are supported by dining hall leftovers from HUDS and receive a large number of undergraduate and graduate student volunteers  alike. Calls for public restrooms were heard and answered with the installation of a public toilet in Harvard Square during the winter of 2015. A series of articles have been published on the homeless population here, providing a necessary vessel for their stories to be told.
Much has been done, but more must follow. This place is home to many of us, and despite the various ways in which this word may manifest itself, we must make a concentrated effort to participate consciously in it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has appealed a National Labor Relations Board decision to invalidate a student unionization election held last fall, the latest step in a unionization process that has lasted months.
In July, NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. ruled that a student unionization election held at Harvard last fall was invalid and called for another vote on the matter. Lawyers representing Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers had argued that lists of eligible voters circulated by Harvard before last November’s unionization election were inadequate, so the results of the vote should be deemed invalid and another election should be held.
But Harvard has argued that the election—which showed more students voting against unionization than for it in a contested vote count—is valid, and has filed to let the election stand.
“The University believes strongly that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of the majority of eligible voters, should stand,” Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email to students after Walsh’s ruling. “Harvard will ask the NLRB in Washington, DC, to review the regional director’s decision.”
In its appeal, the University challenged Walsh’s finding that Harvard “seeks to change established Board law” by arguing that the election was valid.
“There are compelling reasons for the Board to reconsider outdated case law regarding voter list compliance,” lawyers representing the University wrote in the appeal.
In an email, Belle Cheves, a graduate student and union supporter, criticized the University’s decision to appeal.
“We are disappointed in Harvard’s decision to appeal,” she wrote. “An integral role of the NLRB is to uphold fair union elections. If voter lists can be compromised, this goes against fair democratic processes for workers across the US—it won’t just prohibit us from having a new election.”
The NLRB in Washington, D.C. that will review Harvard’s appeal is composed of presidential appointees. At the start of President Donald Trump’s term, there were two Democrats, one Republican, and two vacancies on the Board. Since then, Trump has nominated two Republicans, Marvin Kaplan and William Emanuel. The U.S. Senate recently confirmed Kaplan’s nomination, while Emanuel has advanced out of committee and awaits a vote by the whole Senate. If Emanuel is confirmed, Republicans will hold a majority on the NLRB.
Union organizers have argued that Harvard has prolonged the dispute over unionization to wait until Republicans, who might be more likely to favor the University’s position, are confirmed on the NLRB.
“Harvard’s disregard for the adverse impact of an anti-union Trump NLRB ruling tells us how far they are willing to go to prevent us from unionizing,” Cheves wrote.
In his email, Curran wrote that Harvard hoped to resolve its disagreement with unionization organizers soon.
“The University is eager to resolve these issues and confirm the outcome of the November 2016 election,” he wrote.

Harvard’s American Repertory Theater Institute—a graduate drama program—is suspending admissions this year while the costs of the program are addressed. “What costs?” you may ask. “The two-year tuition expense of $62,593,” we would answer.
Flyby was shocked by that, and naturally we wondered what else we could do with so much cash. Here is what we found.
See Hamilton front and center in NYC at least 32 times
We’re not talking about back-row, bring-your-binoculars, at-least-I’m-inside-the-theater seats. With your A.R.T. Institute tuition as your budget, you could afford to sit within spitting distance of the actors for one of the biggest shows in theater today. Ticket prices vary, but by our estimate, your tuition would give you enough money to do this not once, not twice, but 32 times.
Stay at a castle in Europe
Who needs to play Marie Antoinette when you can live like her? The costs for spending the night at a castle in Europe vary drastically depending on location, but your tuition would definitely cover at least a few weeks at a palace in the country of your choice.
Drink 13,607 large lattes from Crema Cafe 
A large latte at Crema costs $4.60—cringe-worthy on a good day, right? But if you’re looking to reallocate your A.R.T. tuition money, you could get a large latte at Crema every day for 37 years. Let that sink in.
Buy one of those cars in the Matthew McConaughey ads
Alright, alright, alright—we don’t know anyone who’s ever taken a car ad featuring Matthew McConaughey seriously (or any car ad, for that matter), but if you’re looking to drop $62,593, a new set of wheels might appeal to you. The Lincoln Black Label MKC, as advertised by McConaughey, is well within your budget. As a matter of fact, given the cost of gas and the car’s gas mileage, you could buy the car and travel over 178,000 miles without paying more than your A.R.T. Institute tuition.
