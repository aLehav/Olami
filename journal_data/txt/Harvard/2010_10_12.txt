After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Universities, once the centers of excellence in instruction and discovery, have begun to lose their way. With the burdens of administrative bloat, overpriced tuition, overpaid teachers, decadent facilities, and subpar educational experiences, one wonders how they still exist in their current form. Furthermore, with the Internet containing nearly every piece of literature ever published for free, one can also marvel at why teachers need prevail as well.
Teachers in higher education differ from their lower peers in that they only instill their charges with new material, assuming the students have already been socially conditioned by roughly 20 years of life. Due to the widespread availability of information, this monopoly by the universities has been destroyed, essentially leading to a world where teachers and their associated system of aids are no longer sine qua non.
Schools have traditionally provided two essential services: the knowledge necessary to call oneself a specialist and the motivation necessary to study. The former was either provided to students in lectures or through university printed books—e.g. the historical Oxford University Press—while the latter was maintained via assignments and evaluations.
But every technological revolution begets multiple sociological ones. In this case, it is how pupils are taught. With the advent of the Internet, not only are lectures with slides widely available for free,but so are computerized versions of nearly every book accompanied by many assignments. Students can now learn by themselves from anywhere in the world. The Open University in England has been working under this model for decades, allowing adults worldwide to further their education.
Even without these changes, the current system has to change. Classes are so large that discourse is no longer a possibility; lectures have entered the domain of broadcasts. Practicals, once the hallmark of any scientist, have been transformed into hands-off experiments utilizing century-old equipment.
Furthermore, with an increasingly interconnected world, governments and their interstate counterparts have now begun to standardize higher education. Degrees and diplomas, formerly the purview of individual institutions, are subject to a barrage of rules and regulations dictated by state authorities ranging from professional accreditation boards to education ministries. This has left the universities bereft of power—merely shells of their former glory.
But some believe that dispensing of teachers is not all that should be done. Bill Gates has even ventured so far as to state that “place-based colleges” are the way of the past. However, he completely omits the sociological factor.
Learning and teaching are social phenomena. There are people that take joy from endowing the wisdom of their years to their young disciples. It is for this reason that the full name of university in Latin is universitas magistrorum et scholarium, meaning community of teachers and scholars. It is also for this reason that the English language has four different words for a lecturer—teacher from Greek through German, professor, doctor, and master from Latin through French.
Our society bequeaths value to teachers, though not wholly enough. If it were not for people who devote their lives to the next generation, we would not advance forward. Future ideas and inventions would be lost before even being conceived.
What has been lost from modern education is this societal feeling. A university is not a campus of lecture, study, residence, and dining halls. It is more than just buildings. Not only does it have institutional values but also a place where historically people have been free to study what they desire. Ridding universities of campuses only compounds the issue.
In essence, a social campus is needed. Imagine a university campus predominantly composed of students—a grand expanse with accommodations to meet students needs. High schools graduates would enroll in programs and be given a standard curriculum of courses to follow for the next few years. At the onset of each term, they would be assigned readings and assignments followed by a final exam to prove their acumen and understanding.
This system of self-learning is not novel. It is the norm in upper-year courses and graduate studies. Applying this to all years of universities would not only simplify the system, but would also lead to a better experience. Claiming new students cannot adapt to such a radical departure in teaching methodology only discredits humanity’s ability for environmental adaption.
In such a system, a web of upper-year students can provide help to younger students upon need. Researchers can even provide question-answer periods via audio-video communications from nearby institutes not dissimilar to today’s office hours.
Utopia. Maybe people should want to learn for themselves, not because they were told to do so. However, not every student is the perfect learner. Like any system, education should both foster efficiency and equality to be innovative and inclusive, respectively. In time, optimizations could accommodate such needs.
But then again, anything is better than teachers that care more about filling out the next grant application, having their staff publish their next paper, and seeing their names in a so-called prestigious journal. Was the whole point of research not to experiment?

On Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team honored former captain Meg Berte Owen ’94 who, after surviving Hodgkens Lymphona 13 years ago, succumbed to lung complications last year. When Owen played against Cornell her senior season, the team lost to the Big Red, 1-0.
This time, with Owen’s family and friends in the stands, the Crimson soccer team (5-4-1, 2-1 Ivy) honored the former All-American with black bands and a 2-0 win.
“It was a difficult game,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “Cornell was a very, very difficult team to play against. They bring it, they’re physical, and you have to match their intensity, or you’re in deep trouble. I thought we did. We played real well today.”
In its third straight victory, and second straight Ivy victory, the Crimson began the game going shot-for-shot with the Big Red (5-6-0, 0-3-0). While each side managed six attempts at goal, the Cornell squad had trouble finding the back of the net.
Cornell struggled to finish off its shots, but Harvard took advantage, grabbing its first goal in the 18th minute. After a penalty on Cornell, junior defender Lindsay Kowal belted a free kick past the outstretched hands of Big Red goalkeeper Kelly Murphy to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
“The first goal, Lindsay sent a perfect ball into the box, and it just bounced off of one of the players and went in,” sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro said. “So although it was an own-goal, it was a perfect ball by Lindsay.”
“The second goal, I think, was really important for our team, because it really propelled us forward for the rest of the game,” she added.
Seven and a half minutes later, the Crimson struck for a second time as Conigliaro knocked a corner kick into the mix of players in front of Murphy’s goal. Senior Kerry Kartsonis grabbed the header, hammering the ball in.
During halftime, with the score 2-0 in Harvard’s favor, Owen’s family and teammates stood alongside Crimson athletic director Bob Scalise as he announced the new Meg Berte Owen ’94 Memorial Award, created with the $40,000 raised by classmates and friends.
“This was something that we were all looking forward to doing, because although we didn’t know her, she definitely has a legacy here,” Conigliaro said. “The whole week leading up to it, we were getting ready for that, talking about when we play, play for Meg. I think they did a great job honoring her, which was really nice.”
Moving into the second half, Cornell swapped goalkeeper Murphy out in favor of junior Megan Bartlett. Barlett quickly felt the pressure from the Crimson’s front line, which took 16 shots in the half compared to the Big Red’s eight. But with Bartlett’s four saves and Harvard goaltender Jessica Wright’s three saves, both teams seemed at a standstill.
“I think we came out strong, and I think we kept maintaining the pressure,” Leone said. “The Cornell goalkeeper made some good saves, and it was difficult, [and] we made some good saves, so it was a good game. It’s not like I felt we didn’t come out hard, I felt we did, but they just played well too.”
As the clock ticked down, Cornell scrambled to produce a goal, but Wright and her defense, including two fellow freshmen Peyton Johnson and Claudia Haeussler, stayed strong to give Harvard its first shutout of the year.
“[The freshmen are] getting better and better,” Leone explaind. “They’re getting more experience and doing well.”
The experience will continue to build as the Harvard squad journeys to Brown next weekend. Brown, like Cornell, is known for its height and skill in the air, and after a close loss to Princeton last weekend, the Bears will prove to be another challenge for the Crimson.
“It was a hard game today,” Leone remarked. “But isn’t every Ivy League game? They’re all hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, everything just seems to fall into place.
After dropping 11 of its first 14 matches, the Harvard women’s volleyball team turned it around this weekend, winning two big conference matches against visiting Columbia and Cornell at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Crimson (5-11, 2-2 Ivy) won six sets over the weekend, equaling the number that the squad had won over the previous nine matches combined.  In the process, Harvard compensated for its two league losses earlier in the season to Dartmouth, leveling its conference record at 2-2.
In the first weekend game, the Crimson roared back from a 2-0 deficit against the Lions, taking the next three sets to win the match.
The following night, the team again found itself in a hole early, this time against the Big Red. Once more, Harvard staged a comeback, winning three straight sets to take a weekend sweep.
“We’ve been having great practices,” junior libero Christine Wu said. “It just hasn’t been translating back on court. But [we’re] finally getting there, and I’m just so proud of our team. We had a fantastic weekend.”
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
Harvard faced Ancient Eight opponent Cornell (3-10, 1-3) on Saturday night, just one day after beating Columbia in a match that has the potential to be the turning point in the team’s previously lackluster season.
In the first set, the Big Red quickly took the advantage, easily winning 25-17.
Rejuvenated by Friday’s comeback, the Crimson was unfazed.
“We started off a little slow,” said sophomore outside hitter Taylor Docter, “but I think everyone knew after the way we played [Friday] that it was very possible for us to turn it around and come back. And we did.”
In the second set, things began to go Harvard’s way. Tied 23-23, junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll’s shot slid along the top of the net and finally fell on Cornell territory, giving the squad a match-point opportunity. The Crimson took advantage, winning the next point to even the contest at one set apiece.
Harvard squeaked out a 26-24 victory in the third set.
In the fourth and final set, the Crimson held off a late Big Red charge to win, 25-20.
“Today’s game was awesome,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We stuck to the game plan, [and] we were patient. We did a great job.”
As the front players banged out kills, Wu quietly had a big game, saving a number of points with her acrobatic defensive stops. Over the weekend, the junior had 31 digs, with 10 coming on Saturday. Her 1,109 career digs are seventh in team history.
“Wu, as always, has amazing defense,” Docter said. “We all love her to death.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 2
In front of a packed crowd, the Crimson squared off against visiting Columbia (9-4, 1-2) on Friday. Early on, the match seemed to be headed in a familiar direction for Harvard, as the host team dropped the first two sets, 25-19.
Then, finally, after a season full of frustration, things fell into place.
“Our team just started clicking—it just started gelling,” Wu said. “Everyone just started playing lights-out, all heart and soul and passion, and it just felt so good.”
After taking the third set, 25-19, the Crimson and the Lions faced off in what became a marathon set. As the game came down to the wire, the teams traded points until the score was tied at 29-29.
Finally, Harvard broke through. After sophomore setter Beth Kinsella earned a crucial kill, the Crimson grabbed the ensuing point, winning the fourth set and evening the match at two games each.
Harvard then closed the door on Columbia, squelching a late Lion comeback to take the final set, 15-12.
“[Friday’s] match was great,” Weiss said. “We showed a lot of heart and a lot of character in that one.”
Docter’s play was instrumental in the team’s victory. Tallying a team-leading 17 kills, the sophomore had a .441 hitting percentage.
“[Docter] played fantastic,” Wu said. “She really stepped it up. She’s been working hard in practice, and that’s obviously showing here in games.”
“That’s the Taylor I know,” Weiss added.
But the real sparkplug for the Crimson was Kinsella, who accounted for 44 of the team’s 56 assists. Her 256 assists this year lead the team.
“Beth, our setter, had one of the best games she’s ever played,” Docter said. “It just turned into such a dynamic system after the third game, and Beth started running a really fast offense.”
It was this change in pace that completely shifted the game’s momentum.
“It wasn’t going fast in the beginning,” Weiss said. “We were kind of sitting back, and then we started going fast, and we broke their defense down...We got it going finally.”

James Levine’s decision to program Gustav Mahler’s colossal Symphony No. 2—commonly known as the “Resurrection” Symphony—as the first piece in Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO)’s 2010-2011 season proper, however appropriate, is an audacious one. Levine has experienced a kind of resurrection of his own, returning to Symphony Hall after a battle with health problems, but Mahler’s second symphony is a consuming piece for all involved—especially for those immersed in an uninterrupted flux and flow of the almost mystical work of music-making. As its title suggests, the “Resurrection” Symphony demands from its players the ability to impart a sense of otherworldliness, and indeed, the sheer magnitude of the scoring itself pushes the bounds of traditional symphonic form. Mahler calls for a full orchestra (with extra players in each section; the woodwinds especially with each part doubled), a full choir, as well as an additional off-stage brass and percussion ensemble. On Friday, October 9 at Symphony Hall, the BSO took on this challenge with impressive spirit, and succeeded in bringing those present a thoroughly transcendental aesthetic experience.
The violins and violas heralded in the beginning of the first movement—originally conceived by Mahler as a lone standing symphonic poem called “Totenfeier,” or “Funeral Rites”—with an ominous, forceful tremolo. Mahler marked this movement to be played “Allegro maestoso,” which translates loosely to “gravely fast.” As it seems almost a contradictory instruction, various conductors have interpreted it to be wildly different tempos. When focused more on the “allegro,” the movement takes a pressing sense of urgency that emphasizes its violent mood. However, at such a tempo, the gravity of death that should so heavily drip from the movement is undercut by the agitated and hurried triplets and sixteenths played by the cellos and basses. The loss is equal when focusing more on “maestoso.” Levine admirably circumvented this problem by taking on a tempo that seems to perfectly balance urgency with gravity. The result, combined with the hauntingly sweet and delicate phrases occasionally played by the higher-pitched instruments, was a movement that captured the spectrum of nuanced and often contradictory emotions surrounding death.
This ability to balance between two extremes is what made the BSO’s performance so successful. The Andante movement started with gentle phrasing and subdued dynamics—stunningly soft for such a large orchestra—but the pastoral sounds suddenly gave way to darker tones, marked by sharply staccato string phrases. The tone shifted again, with the violins playing a pizzicato backdrop based on a major chord, creating a sound that can only be described as quaint. The movement continued on that way, weaving in and out of darkness and light; however, the BSO transitioned so effortlessly from one to the other that, rather than being presented as a change of mood through time, the movement was presented as one whole, bearing two moods in seeming opposition.
The BSO’s mastery of this binary did falter at times. Mahler’s “Resurrection” Symphony can be a bona fide technical nightmare for brass players. Not only is it one of the longest pieces in the repertoire, it also calls for fortissimos, often and for extended periods of time. Thus, the strain on a brass player’s embouchure is enormous, especially if they are maximizing their dynamic range all throughout the piece. It is more difficult to keep in tune as the piece progresses and it’s also more difficult to maintain tones without slipping into a different harmonic. “Urlicht,” the fourth movement, suffered most noticeably from this issue. The trumpets and the horns, who pick up immediately after the first mezzo-soprano solo, were conspicuously out of tune. The fourth movement is a particularly spiritual movement, evocative of an angel-boy mourning the newly dead, and it was regrettable that the jarring dissonance was enough to (at least temporarily) interrupt the celestial lull.
However, one can hardly blame the brass section for pushing themselves so hard through the piece; the small blips were well worth the surreal expanse of sound created through the rest. Particularly memorable was the middle of the fifth movement; a soft timpani solo slowly continued to crescendo until it was joined by the thundering boom of the brass section, and the impossible fortissimo was sustained brilliantly by the orchestra. One could swear to seeing the sound gradually filling up Symphony Hall, reaching the very crests of its domes, seeming to engulf all present.
The choral musicians involved did a no-less remarkable job. Soloists Layla Claire and Karen Cargill came through the backdrop of a full choir and orchestra with both power and elegance. Cargill, especially, gave a striking performance with her mezzo-soprano voice that was so rich and fluid that it was reminiscent of honey. The Tanglewood Festival Chorus, led by John Oliver, added a yet more sublime dimension to the BSO’s performance. They, like the BSO, almost uncannily maneuvered between extremes of dynamics and mood. At first, the choir sang in a higher register, barely audible and almost timid. But, as if embodying the determination of the human spirit to conquer death, they filled the hall with a sound as large as that of the full orchestra. As the vast “Resurrection” Symphony came to a close, the voices of the choir soared in a religious joy above the sustained chords of the orchestra. It was almost enough to make an atheist believe in the divine.
Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 is, in its very form, a piece that disregards traditional boundaries. It is also a piece whose theme deals strictly with overcoming the most universal of boundaries: death. To take this work on—let alone to do it justice—is almost itself a transcendental task. Yet the BSO did exactly that, and James Levine and company impressively imparted to those in Symphony Hall the beauty that lies beyond.

Whether you’ve heard his distinctly loud saxophone style blasting from his room in Winthrop or seen him in one of his many neurobiology classes, Kazemde A. George ’12 stands out among the young musicians in the Boston community as well as within the student body.
Participating in Harvard’s joint degree program with the New England Conservatory, the junior will receive a bachelor’s degree in neurobiology and a master’s in music in five years. Although his friends may joke about him being a musician and going to Harvard on the side, George has found that it is more than possible to follow one’s academic pursuits without abandoning a love for music.
The Harvard Crimson: How do you think your music style has changed since you first started?
Kazemde George: Certain teachers have really taken me to another level. I study with Danilo Perez, who I am a big fan of as a musician. He’s this Panamanian musician who plays in my favorite jazz band right now, which is the Wayne Shorter Quartet. Studying with him is amazing. He heard me play a couple times and saw what I could do and was trying to do. And he really took me to the next logical place for where I was going.
One time I brought my band in for a lesson. We played a song for him and he said, “OK, that was good, but you guys should put more webs in your playing. You guys need to play with more webs. You should play more like Spiderman.” So that’s the kind of teacher he is. He really gave me a few important things that are defining characteristics of my playing now by telling me to play like Spiderman.
THC: What do you think are your defining characteristics?
KG: I play really loud. I’m like the loudest sax player I know. I do this thing where I play really fast notes that blend together. Also, my dad is a drummer, so sometimes I think I’m more rhythmic. I don’t think I’m the most melodic player.
THC: Considering your individualistic style as a jazz artist, how do you see yourself contributing to this genre and the evolution of music in general?
KG: People would take swing music and intellectualize it as much as they could. It was crazy and so edgy because it was really intellectualized and would end up sounding like Stravinsky. That’s what jazz was. And now modern musicians take that sound and try to reproduce it, and that’s a lot of what modern jazz is today. But for me, what defines jazz is not the actual sound of the notes they are playing, but that social context of rebelling against the popular music and taking something that is really simple and danceable and making it really intellectualized. And that’s why I feel like it’s totally appropriate to do the same thing with hip-hop.
I want to take hip-hop and intellectualize it in the same way swing was. There’s no name for that yet. That’s where I’m trying to go. The direction I’m trying to go is making that new genre out of hip-hop and pop music. Taking the music people dance to today and intellectualizing it. If I could make an analogy, it’s like Picasso. Take a picture of a face and make a crazy disproportionate interpretation of it. And arguably, that’s a more higher intellectual way of thinking, because it’s more abstract and different than just drawing a picture of a face exactly. I would argue it’s of a higher intellectual order for Picasso to make this abstraction of a face. And I’d like to make an abstraction of a beat so that it sort of alludes to a beat, like Picasso did with art.
THC: So what do you envision for your future?  Do you see yourself as a neurobiologist doing music as well?
KG: Some people are pre-med. I am pre-music. I will probably teach a lot, and hopefully get some gigs and make enough money to live. For me, it’s not about the money. People always comment and say its great that I go to Harvard because I have that back up plan.  But I don’t see it like that--I think I would rather just be homeless and play music all day than have money and a nice apartment and not play music and have it just be a hobby. That’s how I feel in a really idealistic sense.

Biannually hundreds of industry leaders travel to four cities for a month of back-to-back shows in multiple venues, models are rushed in and out of shows for drastic makeup, hair, and outfit changes, and designers obsess far in advance over music, theme, seating arrangements, and venue for a 20-minute presentation.
You’d think that someone at some point would have consolidated and systematized Fashion Week and fashion shows. Indeed, in recent years, several designers have turned to video as a cheaper and more efficient option. But the fashion show affords designers the chance to overwhelm through spectacle in conjunction with the drama of contingency, which cannot translate to video, and thus preserves the show as the primary means of showing a collection.
With his sensational fantasies that verged on narrative, the late Alexander McQueen orchestrated shows that were as synonymous to his fashion house as his designs. In doing so, he simultaneously pointed to the inspiration for his designs and projected a larger social statement upon them. In his Fall/Winter 2009/2010 collection, “The Horn of Plenty,” McQueen seems to be toying with, embracing, and aestheticizing the extremes of distortion, objectification, and disfiguration—three charges often leveled at high fashion.
Models with their mouths smeared with lipstick circumambulate a towering pile of black detritus to the beat of heavy thudding electronic music on a floor composed of dozens of cracked mirrors. Some models’ heads are bound by what resembles clear and black duct tape to lamp shades, umbrellas, and other items; others seem to be wrapped in caricatured plastic surgery post-op bandaging. Instead of the standard poses, the models contort their bodies and gestures. They sport bulbous forms sprouting off from the body, dramatic asymmetrical silhouettes, and traditional hound’s-tooth checks descending into warped optical illusions. By putting on this fantastical and dystopian spectacle exuding distortion, McQueen absolves or at least discredits its negative connotations by recoding it within aesthetic and artistic practice.
In keeping with this production of spectacle, Viktor & Rolf additionally manipulate the structure of the show as being temporally contingent in their Fall/Winter 2009/2010 collection, “The Glamour Factory.” The show is not presented as a finished product, but rather as a work in progress—the designers, models, and garments’ performance within the show completes the collection. The Dutch designers Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren walk onto the runway with model Kristen McMenamy waddling under layers of heavy winter clothing, stopping in the revolving center. Layer by layer, Horsting and Snoeren remove articles of clothing from McMenamy, alter and transform them, and outfit nine other models. Once McMenamy is stripped down to a nude bodysuit, 13 other models enter in new outfits that Horsting and Snoeren remove to adjust for McMenamy. The designers have to be exact while reassembling and layering the clothing otherwise, the layers will not fit. But they also have to be quick and efficient because the show is precisely timed. Viktor & Rolf present the frantic and uncertain process of getting dressed and undressed, which is usually relegated backstage and away from the eyes of the audience, as a spectacle to be gawked at and as the structure of the show.
Gareth Pugh has taken a slightly different approach. Instead of trying to replicate the fashion show in video form as other designers have done, Pugh and director Ruth Hogben seemed to acknowledge and demonstrate the specific capabilities intrinsic to video. This season Pugh screened an 11-minute video, which riffed on distortion as McQueen’s production did, to the fashion elite during Paris Fashion Week. McMenamy is shown writhing, running, swiveling, collapsing, stumbling, stomping, and kicking throughout the film in Pugh’s asymmetrical tailoring, exaggerated billowing drapery, and geometrically morphing patterns. Pugh and Hogben add their disorienting use of multiple cameras and camera angles, multiplication and distortion of McMenamy’s body into a kaleidoscope-view, superimposition of her torso onto a male model’s muscular legs, acceleration of motion, and dizzying editing between different clips for an overwhelming and head-pounding viewing experience.
Pugh suggests that in changing mediums for showing a collection, one must also radically adjust approaches. Video, unlike the show fettered to its contingency, affords time to edit, fix, and alter scenes (as evidenced by the closing model’s painful fall at Burberry this season that was neatly spliced out of the video now posted on the house’s website). Though most designers make use of and depend on the fashion show to a lesser extent than either Alexander McQueen or Viktor & Rolf have, the show remains spectacular in its possibility and irreplaceable by video. So bring on the spray-tanned models in October for Spring/Summer shows, venues transformed into Versailles for an hour, and fashion shows where the start time is never as posted, but dependent on the timing of the previous show and the celebrities en route.

Experimental and Elizabethan elements are strange bedfellows, but in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Friedrich Schiller’s 1800 drama “Mary Stuart,” the two come together so brilliantly that one can only hope for more such fruitful unions. The plot is familiar due to its largely historical content, embellished as it was by Schiller. However, this latest rendition of the work effortlessly reconciles the gravity of the subject matter with a modern interpretation of the text.
The story is complex, and at least some prior knowledge of the power struggle that consumed the lives of the queens Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart is highly recommended—thankfully, the program includes a brief summary of the relevant historical events. There are some crucial differences between the play and the truth, the most notable being the fictional yet pivotal scene during which Elizabeth (Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12) and Mary (Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13) meet. While the encounter never occurred, this elaboration on the truth only serves to make the characters more relatable as human beings rather than objectified as static historical figures. An open knowledge that the play is embellishing the lives of real people gives an air of voyeuristic delight to the show—the shared secret that the performance is a peek into the private lives of royalty fascinates and renders the plot more open to psychological interpretation.
The audience is ushered into the Loeb Experimental Theater—where the play runs through October 16—entering a spartan black room with around only 50 seats, a nearly transparent white curtain, a table with a cross, glass goblet, and a pewter pitcher, and jazz music playing softly. A tragic and spare elegance pervades the space, but as the play begins it is starkly offset by the passionate acting.
The costumes, designed by Wendy H. Chang ’12, are for the most part modern. The men wear classic suits and the women contemporary dresses. Rossi is the most elaborately dressed, as befits her character—she is first seen draped in gold with one shoulder bare, a veritable Athena of the Jazz Age whose court is attended by the stunning and manipulative Lord Dudley, the Earl of Leicester (Felix L. Cook ’13). Cook’s British accent adds another layer of authenticity to his performance, and the casting overall is quite commendable. The actors seem particularly suited for their parts, such as Benjamin J. Lorenz’s ’14 portrayal of Sir Mortimer, the young nephew of Mary’s guard who attempts to rescue her from imprisonment. His youth and aura of innocence readily integrate into the character, whose naiveté is perverted into violent fanaticism.
The forestage’s bareness is offset by the comparative splendor of the English court at Westminster. The floor is painted gold and crimson with a single golden chair dominating the slightly raised platform from where the monarch rules. In a sea of black, a hand-fashioned neon Tudor rose looms behind her. Its frailty and gaudiness remind the audience of the uncertain claim that Elizabeth I had to the throne, and it serves as a souvenir of the violent War of the Roses, which resulted in the ascendance of the Tudor dynasty.
The dichotomy between Rossi and Feinberg’s essences is palpable—in contrast to the splendor of Rossi’s realm, Feinberg’s domain is bare, without any color but black and the somber brown wood of a writing desk and chair. However, the thin white curtain which separates the two worlds is diaphanous enough to serve as a reminder that although the women meet only once, each of their lives is haunted by the shadow of the other, that both are never completely free of the other’s gaze and scrutiny.
The most striking scene is their meeting, a moment in which the ingenuity of director James B. Danner ’12 truly shines through. In order to maintain the integrity of the production, the marvelous twist of this climax shall not be divulged, but Danner’s bold decision, though risky, is commendable and contributes to the complexity and uniqueness of the play. It is often difficult to make a 200-year old script breathe, pulsate, and resonate with a modern audience. Not only are the technical elements superb, the acting phenomenal, and the staging exquisite, but the entire play is a success because the complexities inherent in the script are elevated to new heights by the inclusion of such an experimental element.
A number of the play’s lines are particularly memorable, but one of the most haunting occurs when Feinberg, struggling against an overzealous Lorenz, utters, “Who will save me from my savior?” Entwining his fingers in her dark mane, his passion is raw, and Feinberg’s chilling fear resonates. Similar to this moment, the production as a whole is stunning in the most classical sense of the word—one cannot move or speak, only reflect and ponder the fate of the two queens.

“I would rather have a more marginal poetry that was more dynamic and diverse than a poetry that had a more central place in our culture, but was more monolithic,” says Robert N. Casper, editor of “jubilat.” On October 13, the Woodberry Poetry Room will host a discussion with Casper and Jennifer S. Flescher, poet and editor of the literary magazine, “Tuesday; An Art Project,” that addresses the question of diversity in poetry today. The talk, titled “Five Minutes with the Editors: Locating Your Voice in the Literary Zeitgeist,” will illuminate the process of submitting work to literary journals. Last year, Newsweek reported that poetry readership has fallen by half in the last 16 years. Flescher and Casper’s presentation will concern not only how young writers can be heard, but also what being heard means in today’s literary culture.
Getting heard, according to Casper, often begins with publications like his own. “Literary magazines,” he says, “are the first straight step writers make to reach an audience they don’t know.” According to Casper, a poet may hope that publishing a poem in a literary magazine will enable his work to reach a community of contemporaries.
The world of American poetry that Casper describes is not so much a cohesive “zeitgeist” as it is numerous fragmented communities of poets. These communities tend to center around Master of Fine Arts programs in specific geographical regions, with little communication between them. “It’s a little bit frightening,” he says. “If tomorrow, someone writes the next ’Wasteland‘—can we be sure that it will be canonized, that people in 20 or 30 years will know about it?”
“No one gets rich and famous writing poetry,” Casper says, referring to the isolated nature of these groups. But far from despairing the future of poetry, he instead emphasizes the importance of these small communities. Casper believes that the mass participation in poetry through smaller venues has allowed many new, diverse voices to emerge. It is a craft, he says, which can never lose its audience or its relevance. “When there’s a tragedy, or something wonderful, people look to poetry as a source of insight,” he says.
Both Casper and Flescher emphasize the importance of situating their journals in contemporary poetry. Flescher says that she is interested in publishing a wide variety of writers in “Tuesday,” especially by juxtaposing the work of already established poets with that of burgeoning artists. “I like to think about the arc of a writing life,” Flescher writes in an email. Though she publishes many voices, she tries to seek out an “emotional core” in the work she publishes, partly, she says, as a reaction to the nature of poetry today. “There is a dwelling in too much irony,” she writes. “There seems to be a backlash to feeling.”
“[The decline in poetry readership] speaks to a larger concern that we have as a culture—we are more interested in our own expression than getting our own information,” he says. Casper compares the trend of poetry authors outnumbering readers with how individuals are more interested in blogs and opinions than newspapers and facts. He points to the “American dilemma,” how “more people want to participate in culture than experience it.”

We all have a list of fallen favorites. Mine includes “Freaks and Geeks,” “Clone High,” “Sports Night,” “Arrested Development,” and—as of this June—“Party Down;” all astonishingly brilliant television shows that were prematurely cancelled for their poor ratings. To the loyal fan, every season that never was represents the loss of an immensely valuable cultural object. A slew of Internet petitions and mournful blog entries typically mark the untimely demise of a great show, but to no avail. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but cash is mightier than the message board.
Recently, I’ve been thinking about how we pay for television. By the nature of mainstream television’s distribution, our favorite programs are necessarily entwined within a capitalist labyrinth of networks and production houses. Tempting as it may be to demonize television executives as cold and quantitative, it is precisely their job to do just that—the networks wouldn’t stay afloat without real-life Jack Donaghys and Russell Dalrymples.
What, then, can be done? Here’s what I (semi-seriously) propose: an independent source of funding to save culturally significant television shows in danger of cancellation, paid directly to the executive producer to cover production costs.
A collective of television critics, writers and producers, would administer the grants. The National Film Preservation Board could serve as a useful model for this project. The Board selects twenty-five movies annually to be preserved in the National Film Registry. Its members include academics from Tisch and the American Film Institute, as well as filmmakers and journalists. Names you might recognize include Martin Scorsese and Leonard Maltin. For our purposes, we could turn to such industry luminaries as Aaron Sorkin, Lorne Michaels, or Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker, plus representatives from the likes of the Writers Guild of America, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Paley Center for Media. I have no doubt that many eccentric, TiVo-happy millionaires would be delighted to serve as the fund’s beneficiaries.
Moreover, this program might incentivize developing quality programming from the start—board-funded shows would obviously require less network support, and would benefit from publicity as a result of their selection.
Now, a few caveats. By no means should this money be funneled into a killer wrap party on the roof of The Standard Hotel. As part of the application process, perhaps, a program’s staff would have to elucidate their specific plans for use of the funding. It is also important that the board should be permitted no editorial control over the shows it finances; this isn’t “Choose Your Own Adventure” television.
On a similar note, the goal is not to gentrify the television industry, but to offer the slightest nudge in a positive direction. As long as 15 million viewers keep tuning in to watch them, there will always be shows like “Two and a Half Men.” Nor would the board’s selections necessarily err on the side of highbrow—for instance, I would argue that a show like “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” hyper-vulgar as it may be, is extraordinarily valuable (and, fortunately for us, it seems FX agrees). Unlike PBS, with its prerogatives of education and betterment, this board would be committed to nothing other than quality.
This plan is admittedly oversimplified. If FOX nabs the rights to “America’s Most Emotionally Damaged Stripper,” would they consent to waste that precious prime-time hour on a show on life support? It remains the network’s right to renew whichever shows it pleases; it is not my intent to federalize television.
And what about the thousands of young, unknown writers who can’t get NBC to return their calls, let alone pick up their pilots? And the creators of Web series? Producers of public-access shows? One could argue compellingly that these are the individuals who need our assistance most; it is a little troubling to further privilege the privileged.
But that is another project for another day. Network television need not remain the only place for episodic narratives to flourish, but this funding initiative could represent a promising first step toward making mainstream TV more artistically meritocratic.

Rocking through a self-proclaimed story of debauchery, decadence, and breasts, the national tour production of “Rock of Ages”—running at the Colonial Theatre through October 17—transports its audience back to the age of Reagan, leg warmers, and teased hair. Those in search of a fun night out or a good laugh will be welcomed with open arms (and air punches)—though the more traditional musical-goer may feel out of place when the Colonial is transformed into an arena for rock gods.
“Rock of Ages” tweaks a simple musical formula: Guy meets girl. Guy loves girl. Girl loves guy. Girl and guy fall out. Evil German family wants to bulldoze a classic rock bar and replace it with a mall on the Hollywood strip. Guy gets girl. Big finale.
Essentially, the plot of the show is less important than in many other Broadway concoctions; what instead drives the story are suggestive comedic performances, chest-thumping rock ballads, and a brilliant parody of musical convention. The writers and performers continually poke fun that this musical is not your typical “jazz hands” spectacle.
Tony Award nominee—and former American Idol contestant—Constantine Maroulis takes center stage as nervous yet ambitious hero Drew, who works in the infamous rock bar The Bourbon Room. Runaway Sherrie (the talented Rebecca Faulkenberry) follows her dreams of fame and fortune all the way to The Bourbon Room, and there meets Drew—kicking off their rocky relationship. The comedic narration and witty running commentary of Bourbon Room worker Lonny (Patrick Lawallen) moves the show along while adding a necessary layer of self awareness.
The entire atmosphere resembles a live rock concert, including a live band on stage and classic rock tunes blasting over the sound system before the show even starts. Brimming with enthusiasm, the performers run through the aisles, hand out flyers, and fist punch, which helps bring alive a genre of music that may have been forgotten. The Bourbon Room’s interior dominates the stage, with records, posters, and flashing signs hanging on the walls and even suspended from the ceiling. Beowulf Boritt’s set design provides the right tone for the era, creating the sense of Los Angeles in the 1980s. Gregory Gale’s outrageous, vivid, and sometimes revealing costumes complement the set, completing the illusion of stepping back a couple of decades.
With such technical accuracy on their side, the cast have an easy job of bringing the ‘80s to life, which they to do with power, energy, and even a little campiness. In one particularly comical moment, Franz (Travis Walker)—the son of the evil German entrepreneur Hertz (Bret Tuomi)—captures this more eccentric image of the age as he prances around the stage in his buttoned down shirt and grey suit, which is later stripped off to reveal a bright blue sparkly spandex leotard.
Even though the plot can be predictable, the journey both Drew and Sherrie go on resonates. In between rock classics from such bands as Poison and Journey, there is some exploration of what it is to have a dream and follow that dream to the ends of the earth. Combining moments of head-banging and audience participation with flashes of emotion gives the show an unexpected level of depth. However, the production does not go so far as to provide a new outlook on life or a meaningful philosophy—it is simply a fun time.
From the opening announcement of Whitesnake’s David Coverdale asking all audience members to refrain from “Flash photography unless you’re really, really hot and willing to show us your boobs,” all the way through to Lonny summing up the show as “poop jokes with Whitesnake,” “Rock of Ages” never takes itself too seriously. As the cast bursts into a powerful rendition of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” during the big finale, Lonny’s last lines encapsulate the spirit of the show: “In L.A., sometimes the dreams you come with aren’t always the dreams you leave with, but they still rock!”

The Nigerian-American writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once warned about the danger of telling “a single story of Africa.” Narratives of Africa are usually collapsed into one tale of the tragedy of poverty, which a Western audience takes in with what Adichie describes as “patronizing, well-meaning pity.” The same can be said of the story of African immigrants. In Dinaw Mengestu’s “How to Read the Air,” Jonas Woldemariam works for a nonprofit, editing statements for refugees seeking asylum in the United States.  In his job he spends more time rewriting than editing, and he admits that his embellishments could “easily be invented based on common assumptions most of us shared when it came to the poor in distant, foreign countries.”
Jonas’ use of “us,” which shows his lack of identification with the refugees, is conspicuous because he himself is the son of poor immigrants from the distant country of Ethiopia. “How to Read the Air” maps the crumbling relationship of two couples: Jonas’ parents and Jonas and his wife Angela. As his marriage unravels, Jonas recreates, through narrative and a literal road trip, a drive from Chicago to Nashville taken by his parents decades earlier. The difficulties of the immigrant experience is a constant presence in this examination of familial. Intimate in scope yet far-reaching in resonance, Dinaw Mengestu’s second novel “How to Read the Air” is a nuanced portrait of immigrants struggling with the vagaries of belonging in a country that is not quite home.
Mengestu’s own history—he was born in Ethiopia, grew up in Illinois, and finished his education in New York City—bears unsurprising similarities with that of his main character. The protagonists of his acclaimed first novel, “The Beautiful Things that Heaven Bears” are also Ethiopian immigrants. “How to Read the Air” is especially effective in juxtaposing the anxieties of first versus second generation immigrants. The eagerness of Jonas’s father to demonstrate his assimilation by visiting obscure landmarks in American history contrasts with Jonas’ haunting fear that he is too much like the parents against whom he, growing up American, has defined himself. “[Angela and I] were finding that we were still perhaps only a few degrees away from what came before,” he rues about his life.
Jonas hardly identifies as Ethiopian or even as an immigrant—if he identifies as anything at all. “Angela told me I lacked a clear sense of identity,” reports Jonas as discontent creeps into his marriage. Indeed Jonas is rather like a negative space at the center of the novel. Although the novel is narrated in his first person, never does he discuss his own emotions; it is always Angela telling him how he feels. He says he is “simply estranged from the great social machinations with which others were occupied.” That Mengestu manages to make the novel compelling despite having a man so lacking in solidity at its center speaks to his skill in writing between the lines.
“How to Read the Air” often seems to play out the well-worn tropes of a man in midlife crisis wandering, lost, around New York City. Jonas’ marital troubles and his status has a consummate outsider has shades of Hans van den Broek, the narrator of Joseph O’Neill’s “Netherland.” Whereas “Netherland” is grandly ambitious in its summoning of cricket fields, famous landmarks, and a mysterious death—much praise has been lavished on it as the definitive post-9/11 New York novel—“How to Read the Air” delves deeper into the subtleties and implications of a narrative that often folds in on itself. The prose is unfussy but the thematic design intricate.
At its core, the novel explores how prefabricated narratives can dominate over truth in the living out of our lives. This is illustrated through the universal example of the love story. Angela is forever measuring her life with Jonas against that ideal. They wander around New York looking for a café and park bench to claim as their own because that is what couples are expected to do. Their fraying marriage lingers as they act out “scenes plucked from a movie made to convince one that there was nothing more charming than being young and in love in New York.”
The same tension between truth and tidiness in narrative colors Jonas’ telling of his parents’ road trip. He interprets actions and recreates scenes—going so far as to toy with changing the actual events—justifying his changes with the idea that “history sometimes deserves a little revision.” Recalling his job writing refugee statements, he claims to be carrying out his “inevitable role as both advocate and judge over what happened between my parents during this trip.” His revision of history—influenced by a need to understand where his parents are coming from—is how he comes to terms with a childhood where one parent is absent and the other abusive.
This coming-to-terms underlies another story narrated by Jonas, that of his father’s escape from Ethiopia to America hidden in a cardboard box. The father’s harrowing journey is easily the novel at its most colorful and dramatic. However, it reads like one of Jonas’s doctored refugee statements, which, in fact, it is.
Jonas readily admits that he is fabricating the story. The deception should seem outrageous, but the story is also Jonas’ concession to his father in recognizing the forces that made him the petty and angry man that he becomes. “How to the Read Air” may be about African immigrants, but the individual stories of Jonas and his father entwine to produce a family history that is both complex and compelling.

In Nicole Krauss’s third novel, “Great House,” one of her characters muses, “[M]y father, a scholar of history, taught me that the absence of things is more useful than their presence. Though many years later, half a century after he died, I stood… and thought, Useful for what?” The speaker is Weisz, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who specializes in retrieving antique furniture for mourners who wish to reconstruct memories of their dead loved ones. Weisz and his four fellow speakers narrate their ways through the challenges posed by grief, in an attempt to reconcile the absences caused by their respective losses. But despite the interior focus of the work, Krauss manages to avoid writing a novel whose sole preoccupation is the abstract and inevitably cliché emotions of her grieving characters. Rather, her strength as a writer emerges as she focuses on the overwhelming onslaught of thoughts which plague each mourner.
The most effective aspect of Krauss’s “Great House” is the unusual structure of her first person narrative, which shifts between the perspectives of her five protagonists. As her narrators directly address their thoughts and confessions towards specific, cognitively or physically absent characters, Krauss reveals new depths of each speaker’s consciousness. With this form of narration, the characters divulge more about their inner selves than an ordinary first person or omniscient narrative would allow.
A recent widower, and one of Krauss’s narrators, says to his physically absent son: “I need to ask. Will you visit me once I’m gone? Will you come from time to time and sit with me? It’s absurd, I’ll be nothing, just a handful of inert material, and yet I feel it would help me to go more easily if I knew that you would come sometime.”  With this deceptively simple proposition from father to son, Krauss illuminates the concerns of an aging father: the recognition of his own mortality and his regret for never achieving a reciprocal relationship between himself and his son. While it may be psycho-voyeuristically estranging for the father to ask “Is that what you will make of my death, Dov?” in an unwitting address to the reader, such marked questions and assertions preclude any of the narrators’ attempts at affectation and provide footholds for the reader delving into the consciences of the speakers.
Krauss’s subtle shifts of perspective are equally effective from one narrator to the next. Another character, Mr. Bender, struggles to reconcile the woman that he knew as his love and the woman he discovers she actually was—the woman he “grossly misunderstood” prior to her death. As Bender recovers more information about his late lover’s past, he divulges information about himself and the realities of their relationship. “Suddenly I wanted to cry,” Bender states upon first realizing how little he knows of his lover, “Out of frustration and exhaustion and despair of ever really coming close to the center, the always-moving center of the woman I loved….what hope did we really have of ever making sense of ourselves, let alone one another?” But as he begins to reconstruct her life and to pick apart the image she had presented to him, he confesses, “All of my life I had been trying to imagine myself into her skin. Imagine myself into her loss. Trying and failing…My love for her was a failure of the imagination.” Through this process of grief, Bender is finally able to find a release from a lost love that was illusory at best.
Despite Krauss’s ability to open the psyches of her narrators, there is a sense of familiarity that looms over “Great House.” In her earlier novel, “The History of Love,” parallel narrators who are connected by a novel within collide as they attempt to reassert the love they each had lost. “Great House” treads similar territory, with several grieving narrators revolving about a single desk which each associates with his or her respective loss. While Krauss manages to avoid simply repeating the terms of her previous novel through a myriad of clever reversals and false leads as her narrators piece together their post-loss lives, her reversion to the same overall structure and theme threatens her attempts at originality.
Nonetheless, “Great House” succeeds due to its self restrained ambition and to Krauss’s willingness to pose questions about life, love, and loss without feeling the need to answer those that are beyond human reach. Instead, Krauss gives her narrators and, in turn, her reader, the cognitive space to decide what to make of their personal experiences.

With all of the current hoopla surrounding the creation of Facebook and what extraordinary discoveries were made in a Kirkland House suite, it is worth noting that such breakthroughs may also come about in other on-campus spaces—for example, in the Leverett House dining hall. This is where, as a Harvard undergraduate, Tony-winning set designer Derek McLane ’80 got his first taste of his future profession, and was instantly changed. Now, in the midst of a fruitful career in the field of scenic design, McLane will be returning to Harvard to share his joy of the craft with current undergraduates interested in design.
He recalls the experience of designing for a production of “Guys and Dolls” in Leverett: “I really had no idea what I was doing, but I did it, and I was pretty taken with it,” McLane says. “I thought it was amazing, an amazing craft. I was very proud of what I did in the Leverett House dining room. I cringe now when I think about it, but at the time, I was kind of blown away by the possibilities of what you could do with space and storytelling.”
In a pair of workshops to be held October 14 and November 2 in the brand-new “arts lab” being called Arts@29Garden, McLane will speak to student designers about his own projects and career path and will discuss how a design should, as McLane puts it, “describe the world of the play visually.”
Thomas Lee, director of the Office for the Arts’ “Learning From Performers” program of which this event is a part, says that he and McLane collaborated to produce an effective learning experience for students. “We decided that we wanted it to be as hands-on and intensive as possible, to really take students through the process,” Lee says. “We thought that the best thing would be to have a product at the end.”
This product will be a set design for any play or musical—students who are working on a campus show this semester may bring in designs for those productions, and others may imagine designs for any play of their choosing. The students will work on their set ideas in the interim between the two workshops. At the second meeting on November 2, students will present their designs and discuss them as a group. “I’ll kind of play director,” McLane says.
The opportunity to talk through the designs is important, says McLane, as communication is essential to the craft. “Designers are not studio artists—we’re not painters, we’re not sculptors,” he says. “We have to work collaboratively, which can be great, and it also has its shortcomings...You have to have flexibility and be able to adapt, to come up with new ideas.”
McLane is deeply excited about having this opportunity to return to Harvard and speak to students and the wider community—the latter at an event open to the public to be held on the evening of October 14 in a slide lecture and Q&A co-sponsored by the Office of Career Services. “The thing I’m most curious about is what students who are interested in design are like now,” McLane says. “In some ways, they’re a version of myself 30 years ago.”
The buzz from student designers is equally palpable. Isabel Q. Carey ’12, the Co-General Manager of the Harvard College Stage Designers’ Collective—which is co-sponsoring the workshops—says that the reaction from the student design community has been enthusiastic. “There’s been positive response from people who read through and are just like, ‘Wow, this guy is really legit.’ Because he is. He’s really legit,” Carey says.
McLane is currently busy designing for a number of stage productions, as well as—something quite new for him—the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He is returning to his alma mater as a now-bountifully laurelled artist, having garnered two OBIEs (Off-Broadway Theatre Awards), as well as three Tony Award nominations for scenic design—one of them leading to a win in 2009, for the play “33 Variations.” The hope is that a piney whiff of these laurels, and the wisdom of the man who bears them, will inspire and invigorate the set-design saplings of this school, in whose same environment McLane, too, once laid down his roots.

Childhood may always be a time for epic battles of heroism; for fights between cops and robbers, between superheroes and supervillains, between best friends and playground bullies. Perhaps nobody has more convincingly tied this simplistic morality of young children to a single time and place than Philip Roth, who, in works such as “The Plot Against America” and his most recent novel, “Nemesis,” has made his boyhood home of 1940s Newark, New Jersey into the ultimate arena of good and evil. American troops were fighting the Nazis, and Roth’s social context was that of Jews hovering just above or below middle class. The parameters of good and evil in the war abroad seemed equally clear as in the games of boys on a playground.
In Bucky Cantor, the protagonist of “Nemesis,” Roth has crafted the ultimate expression of this world order. Strong-willed, principled, and saddled with a heavy load of guilt and responsibility, 23-year-old Bucky cannot fulfill his fantasy of going to fight in the war because of poor eyesight. Instead, he seeks to enrich the lives of young boys through teaching sports. The arrival of the polio epidimec, however, threatens to destroy this modest dream. Through a brilliant narrative conceit and timeless descriptions of boyhood, Roth creates a modern-day tragic hero who embodies the fragile nobility of his time.
The narrative structure of Roth’s novel is supremely effective in developing both the internality and externality of Bucky’s character. Roth starts off with a third-person limited narration of Bucky’s consciousness told by a minor character, the unnoticed Arnie Mesnikoff. This allows the reader to see the whole world imbued with Bucky’s sensibility while keeping his consciousness at a slight distance. About two thirds of the way through the novel, a turn takes place: Arnie becomes a first person narrator and describes his experience meeting Bucky thirty years later as an utterly changed man. This jarring shift encourages a complete reevaluation of the book’s first half, revealing Bucky’s persona from the outside and divulging his significant limitations. Despite this unsparing analysis of the protagonist’s fall, a final scene of the athletic, 23-year-old Bucky implies that his greatness in youth may redeem the troubles of his older self.
This triumph of boyhood in “Nemesis” extends beyond Bucky, illustrated in a series of sketches of the different boys in Bucky’s life. Because the narrative touches on the stories of several of Bucky’s young wards, Roth paints a unified impression of an age more than of any one personality. Alan, the first child who dies of polio, is described by his father as “the best boy…always did his schoolwork. Always helped his mother. Not a selfish bone in his body…Our house was where all their friends came to have a good time. The place was always full of boys.” Alan, like all the other boys Roth depicts, is faultless, strong, innocent and unselfish. His father’s recollection that their house “was always full of boys” indicates an indiscriminate love for all young men. Even the Kopferman brothers, who are described as respectively “belligerent” and  “mischievous”, are more importantly praised as “uncontrollably energetic…strong, burly boys, good at sports.” It seems that the vitality and athleticism of these boys supercedes their moral character.
Bucky appears to be the apotheosis of the innocent power of boyhood. When a group of Italians comes to the playground where Bucky is working and threaten to spread polio, Bucky refuses to back down and respectfully browbeats them into leaving town. Afterwards, the narrator explains, “His confident, decisive manner, his weightlifter’s strength, his joining in every day to enthusiastically play ball right alongside the rest of us—all this had made him a favorite of the playground regulars… but after the incident with the Italians he became an outright hero, an idolized, protective, heroic older brother.” Bucky’s physical and moral strength here combine to form an ideal of an inspiring young leader, and one who is all the more astounding to the kids for wanting to play baseball with them every summer day. This sort of heroism is plain, and only from a child’s perspective does it possess grandeur. And yet, because it is only from this charmed perspective that the reader sees Bucky, Roth succeeds in connecting this folksy image to heroic stature in our own limited view.
While the simplicity and childishness of Bucky’s moral system elicits a sense of enchantment, it also portends his ultimate self-destruction. After leaving Newark and its rising rate of polio infection for a camp in the Poconos where his fiancée works, Bucky feels “almost able to forget the betrayal of his playground kids…[but] there confronting him were his ideals—ideals of truthfulness and strength fostered in him by his grandfather, ideals of courage and sacrifice that he shared with Jake and Dave…his ideals as a man.” The reference to his leaving Newark as “betrayal” reflects his cripplingly severe sense of responsibility. His ill-defined, abstract set of values, tellingly ascribed to the paternal figure of his life, revolve around a lofty, unrealizable ideal of manhood.
This ethical stance is not only similar to Bucky’s playground existence in its romantic idealism, but also in its childish conception of manhood and heroism. It is this naïve faith in human agency and unending personal responsibility that leads Bucky to his downfall. Through this sensitive portrait of his protagonist, Roth demonstrates the heights of youthful heroism and the tragedy of its ultimate loss.

New York, for some strange reason, has always produced cool bands. The Talking Heads were undeniably hip. The Ramones were so cool it didn’t matter that Joey Ramone went onstage with mucus running out of his nose. The latest band to take a drink from New York’s cool-aid and grab the media’s attention is Apache Beat, a five-piece band from Brooklyn. They have received attention from the press since their first single “Tropics” was released in late 2008. Since then, they have toured with the likes of Deerhunter and Crystal Castles, released a second single, and now have given us their debut album, “Last Chants.” However, in a city as fast-paced as the Big Apple, if you look back for more than a minute, you’ll be left behind, Apache Beat is a perfect case in point—they draw huge amounts of inspiration from the city of New York, but by exploring too much of their city’s musical history, they have failed to say anything original.
Apache Beat certainly is up there on the cool scale. Lead singer Llirjana Alushaj’s stage presence and bravado have already gained Apache Beat a reputation as an electrifying live act. The band has also done their homework well. The album is full of musical references to some of New York’s past greats, especially Sonic Youth and Talking Heads. Paradoxically, this is also the album’s greatest fault. It is so versed in 1980s post-punk and new wave that “Last Chants” forgot to say anything new.
This isn’t to say that the songs are poorly constructed. “Tropics” for example, is one hell of a single. The horns, synthesizers and guitars combine with a pulsing rhythm to create an almost hypnotic soundscape, and Alushaj’s strong voice is truly inspired. The album opener, “Knives,” a fast pasted, power-pop song, drenched in synthesizer chords and punctuated by dissonant guitar riffs, is also a success. Over the sonic backdrop flies Allushaj’s voice, which is strong enough to stand out while still complementing the other musicians. These elements come together to make a catchy, fun song that grabs you from the beginning, steps on the accelerator, and keeps building intensity until the very end. Although the song sounds a bit clichéd, it is an exciting opening track that leads very well into the rest of the album.
“Fear of Falling” is an excellent example of “Last Chants” strengths and weaknesses, embodied in the same song. It’s a great rocker, and the different styles mesh well together. However, all of the musical tropes and styles are pulled directly out of 1980s classics. The song sounds like it could have been taken from a Sonic Youth album, and the second guitar melody at the end sounds like it was sampled from the Stone Roses. Many of the other songs— “Nightwaters” and “Last Chants” in particular—have been so heavily influenced by Talking Heads that they lose any sense of originality. For a band with as much musical talent as Apache Beat, this is a particularly frustrating problem. Some of their emphasis on past musical styles can be explained by the band’s producer. The album was mixed by Martin Bisi, a Brian Eno protégé, who has also worked with Sonic Youth.
On “Last Chants” most of the songs are good. Some are really good. But it lacks the sense of novelty and originality that turns a collection of good songs into a great album. Alushaj says it herself in “Fear of Falling”, when she croons, “What do we do now?” It seems like an apt question for a band to ask after they’ve internalized its influences to such an extent that there is no room for innovation.

Backstreet’s back! Or wait, boy band pop music just hasn’t petered out yet. That’s right—the infamous genre has once again come into the music marketplace with what can only be described as a tired, stereotypical try. It’s true that there is a formula for pop music, but without anything unique or new, even that formula can fall flat. This is exactly what’s happened in the third and newest album of David Archuleta, the runner-up of American Idol’s seventh season. “The Other Side of Down” is unoriginal, over-produced, too slow to be dancy and too fast to be sentimental, and the lyrics barely speak to anything. The album, though it has all the right ingredients, will end up falling short of any lasting popularity.
The first song on Archuleta’s new album is the title track, and like the title suggests, it’s basically the other side of “Down” by Jay Sean. As a matter of fact, the notes Archuleta sings when crying “Down” are almost exactly the same as those in Sean’s song. This kind of echoing seems more like Archuleta is trying to ride the wave of Sean’s popularity for a song released less than a year ago than him coming up with something original. Almost every track of the album mimics contemporary pop to the extreme in that it includes the cheesy, now popular, beat which sounds like a techno turned hip-hop groove found in songs like “Down” and Jason DeRulo’s “In My Head.” Where most pop artists seem to save this rhythm for the dance songs, Archuleta has slowed it down and turned most of his songs into a strange mix of upbeat and sentimental that is really only appropriate to listen to while driving; this cuts it out of typical teenage situations his audience should be enjoying it in—that is, at parties and hanging out in their parents’ houses with friends.
On top of all of this, the lyrics in the songs are almost unbearable. They pile one cliché on top of another until the song doesn’t really mean anything—but they do rhyme! For example in “Look Around,” the most dancy track on the album, Archuleta sings “Like a train wreck, you’re on a mission / Television got you blinded / Better slow down before you lose ground / It’ll happen anyway / Paint it over if your world is gray” which actually means nothing, but can be loosely translated to yet another cliché: stop and smell the roses. The lyrics are highly predictable because of these factors. In “Complain” he sings “No more wasting my time looking in the mirror / Wishing my life was…”—You guessed it! —“A little bit clearer.”
It would be easy to blame the producers on this album for creating something that seems like a marketing ploy to rob the gullible teen consumer who listens to radio DJ’s opinions. Unfortunately, it looks like Archuleta has actually had more of a hand in this album than he did on his first album. Here he co-wrote 10 of the 12 songs whereas on the first he only co-wrote two. It really is a shame that he isn’t doing something more original, because he has a beautiful singing voice proven by his ranking on American Idol. Interviews at the beginning of the season suggested that he had a more interesting idea about developing music, citing R&B and latin music as his main influences. He seems to have lost that inspiration or has just gotten confused and now thinks that adding a beat to your song makes it soulful.
Either way, Archuleta’s new album will not go down in mainstream culture history because it has added nothing new to the pop world. He’s not daring like Lady Gaga, nor passionate like John Mayer, nor a dancer like Justin Timberlake, nor a romantic like the Kings of Leon. He’s just normal, which could be his thing, but he has sadly interpreted normal as regurgitating all of the pop music released in the past year. But he’s young, and with a voice like his perhaps there’s hope for him yet.

From the first track, it is clear that Sharon Van Etten’s newest album “Epic” is much more than entertainment or easy listening—it is the story of her life. Written entirely during an abusive relationship, the music is a chronicle of pain and healing, and a narrative that is both tragic and hopeful. Van Etten bares her soul to her audience, giving herself nowhere to hide as she shares these intensely personal experiences through her deceptively calming songs.
The strength of “Epic” is that it is powerfully simple. Through carefully constructed arrangements, Van Etten’s economy leaves no room for redundance. The result is raw emotion. The tone of the album is unmistakably clear, shifting between pained to hopeful but retaining strength throughout. It’s as if she were performing the songs at an open mic for a tiny crowd. She is by no means an amateur; she simply is natural.
Van Etten’s lyrics also come across unimpeded, telling tales of heartbreak that are at times marked with hope. She shares everything, even though in “A Crime” she claims that she is “Turning all the words around in my head that I won’t say.” She never speaks in ambiguous metaphors but speaks plainly, always getting her message through. In the opening track, “A Crime,” she sings, “Seduce me with your charms / Until I’m drunk on them / Go home and drink in bed / And never let myself be in love like that again.” Her straightforward words give direct access to the emotions she is trying to convey. This clarity allows her doleful songs to never seem forced or fake.
However, the power of her individual songs is not lost in the simplicity of Van Etten’s album. Rather, the grouping gives the individual parts strength through context. The album is cohesive, as it is held together by the story of Van Etten’s past. It opens with the typical singer-songwriter guitar and vocal instrumentation; but there is a satisfying contrast between hearty chords and Van Etten’s sweet voice cooing about the hurt her love dragged her through.
As the album progresses, the songs add electronic instruments and percussion. They also speed up and sound more uplifting, though the lyrics still betray pain and disillusionment. “Don’t you think I know / You’re only trying to save yourself / Just like everyone else,” Van Etten calmly remarks in a sing-songy voice during “Save Yourself.” Here Van Etten sounds stronger, bolstered by a host of harmonies and a soothing slide guitar, a piano, drums and rhythm guitar. The first songs of the album, though progressively more complex, are still tied together with their sweet, pained tone.
Then, with “DsharpG,” the fourth track,  “Epic” takes a sharp turn. “DsharpG” is ethereal—almost verging on shoegaze—and is dominated by a haunting mood. As she switches from sweet to dissonant, Van Etten refocuses the listener on her sorrow. However, while a harmonium drones painfully on in the background, Van Etten’s vocals and harmonies dominate the song, and the result is an angelic triumph over chaos. The peaceful and delicate timbre of her voice drowns her pain, though both are clearly present. While this song would be hard pressed to stand alone, it is magic in the course of the album.
After the taxing experience of “DsharpG,” Van Etten rewards the listener with a worthy finish. She returns to her singer-songwriter style, combined with a more upbeat rhythm and consistently powerful lyrics. The album’s closing number begins again with the harmonium drone, which calls back “DsharpG” and serves as a musical reminder of the ever-present pain of her past relationship. However, her soft voice cuts in, and the result is a tender finish with a touch of hope.
As Van Etten’s last song fades from the speakers, it is clear she has done more than play a collection of songs: she has shared a part of herself and allowed the listener get to know her on a deep level. Her lyrics have a frankness comparable to that of Johnny Cash, and they convey meaning in a simple, direct way. Her music is real, to her and to the listener.

1950s America saw the emergence of the “hooligan,” a troublemaker that was the bane of a society made of white picket fences, easy livin’, and doo wop groups that sang “Life Could Be a Dream.” In his debut album, Peter Gene Hernandez a.k.a. Bruno Mars manages to revitalize this time by both embracing and challenging the R&B he reveres like the hooligan he believes himself to be.
Born into a large and musical family in Honolulu Hawaii, Mars has been exposed to a variety of influences, all of which seem to find their way into “Doo Wops and Hooligans.” We can hear Elvis-inspired rock n’ roll, laid-back island reggae, retro-pop love songs, and ambient piano ballads. All the while, the vocal harmony and incessant beats of doo-wop rhythm and blues remains a constant theme. It is the versatility of his larger-than-life voice that allows him to transcend past the bounds of genres. And so, in “Doo Wops,” we enter the eclectic musical world of Bruno Mars.
We are launched full throttle from the start of the album, with his first single, “Grenade” and his second, the Billboard #1 single, “Just the Way You Are.” We hear the clear, soaring voice that the mainstream pop world first fell in love with on B.o.B.’s “Nothin’ On You.” There’s a sense of purity such that every young woman out there can feel like she’s swept into the stars, leading her to believe him when he sings, “Girl you’re amazing / Just the way you are.” Subtle, however, is the R&B undertone; with every crescendo into the chorus, one can hear the strain of soul.
Different elements of R&B are diffused throughout. “Our First Time,” has the smoother, intimate side with its slower, twinkling melody. Meanwhile “Runaway Baby” gets us into a retro-funk, with an upbeat mood and rock n’ roll beats. The 1950s mood continues into “Marry You,” a testament to the days of old sweethearts and devil-may-care dancing tunes. “Is it that dancing juice? / Who cares? / I think I want to marry you!” Although the lyrics are rather uninspired, Mars can get away with it because his voice is just that angelically clear, and his energy that boyishly charming.
In fact, his distinct and powerful vocal ability allows him to get away with just about anything on this album. “The Lazy Song” and “Count on Me,” are lyrically and musically more different—out of place, even. He sings about chillin’ in his “snuggie,” clicking on MTV, and “not doin anything.” Think Mars on Travis McCoy’s “Billionaire”—light and playful with simple guitar strums in the background giving an island feel. This carefree island air also makes its way into “Liquor Store Blues,” featuring reggae artist. Damien Marley. Again, such a move feels out of place. However, Mars then brings us back into an R&B vibe, but this time, with an electro twist, on the ballad, “Talking to the Moon.”
The album ends with “The Other Side,” featuring contemporary hooligans B.o.B. and C-Lo Green. He sings, “I’ll be waiting on the other side,” and indeed, with the futuristic, synthesized rock n’ roll beats, he seems to be in a new realm of musical style.
Although in parts, “Doo Wops and Hooligans” can seem unfocused, the songs seem to blend mellifluously because Mars’s voice is out of this world, allowing him to ascend above the technical elements and the distinctions of genres. He doesn’t forget to pay tribute to his beloved classic-era R&B, but he also makes room for the sounds of the present. There is diversity in Mars’s musical universe and he may one day have the power to shape the trajectory of R&B in the future.

On October 1, Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen G. Sebelius found themselves apologizing to the Guatemalan government for an unexpected reason: A recent report revealed that American researchers had infected approximately 700 Guatemalans with syphilis between 1946 and 1948 to study the effects of penicillin. In some cases, the taxpayer-funded National Institutes of Health paid for syphilitic prostitutes to sleep with the test subjects in prisons. Other subjects were infected by pouring bacteria into cuts on their bodies. Although the tests were both unethical and appalling, in this situation, the apology issued by Secretaries Clinton and Sebelius was the most appropriate response to the revelations of scientific misconduct.
The U.S. government certainly owed an apology to Guatemalan officials, the victims of the study, and their families, especially given the funding provided by the National Institutes of Health. Apologizing is the most effective response to these revelations, because anything more—such as reparations or indemnity payments, as suggested by Cesar Dura of the Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre—would be impractical. Not only would it be difficult to quantify the amount of payment deserved by the victims and their families, but measures such as reparations would fail to right the past injustices in any productive manner. Although providing money to the victims’ relatives offers some form of compensation, it does not undo the prior wrong or the emotional anguish suffered as a result of the harmful experimentation.
One cause for concern in this case is the time lapse between the act of wrongdoing and its public revelation.  While the subjects were infected with syphilis between 1946 and 1948, the unethical activities were not reported until earlier this year, when they were unearthed by Susan M. Reverby, a professor at Wellesley  College. At the very least, the U.S.’s apology rights the injustice of the experiment’s concealment from public view, providing the victims and their families with the acknowledgement they have deserved for decades.
In addition, we fear that the syphilis experiment may be symptomatic of other cases of medical injustice. If this is the case, the government should immediately release information on comparable situations. For example, the very doctor who spearheaded the Guatemala experiments was also guilty of ethical violations in the famous Tuskegee syphilis tests, when he denied patients medication in order to continue his study of their disease. Between 1963 and 1966, mentally handicapped children in New York City were intentionally infected with hepatitis in order to test treatment methods; also in 1963, patients in a Brooklyn hospital were infected with cancer cells to complete a study of tumors. However horrible their history, it is encouraging that all of these incidents have finally come to light in recent years. The American government has an obligation to continue investigating similar offenses and exposing them to public examination. Responsibility does not end with the doctors who conduct these unethical tests but with the government that endorses or conceals them.

If you go to a Wal-Mart on the last night of the month, you’ll notice an odd scene. After 11 p.m., customers start to pour in, but they all check out after the clock strikes midnight. A similar phenomenon occurs at Kroger’s supermarkets and other 24-hour stores. The reason, as The Wall Street Journal’s Miguel Bustillo reported last week, is that electronic benefit accounts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, colloquially known as “food stamps”) refresh at midnight on the first of every month. Since the recession hit, this has led to increased midnight business, so much so that Wal-Mart has had to increase staffing at those hours to keep up and make an effort to keep shelves stocked for the period.
The people conducting the midnight runs are not just poor, but poor enough that even waiting until morning would leave them without needed food. "If you really think about it,” Bill S. Simon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., explained to Bustillo, “The only reason someone gets out there in the middle of the night and buys baby formula is that they need it, and they have been waiting for it.” These are workers for whom even living paycheck-to-paycheck isn’t enough to keep food coming in regularly. And with food stamp rolls increasing from 26 million in 2007 to 41 million this year (and still growing), these midnight rushes are only going to become more popular in the foreseeable future.
One might look at this situation and see cause for increasing benefits for food stamp recipients. Not too long ago, Congress did just that. In April 2009, the stimulus package boosted every food stamp recipient’s benefits by 13 percent, or $80 a month for a family of four. The increase was supposed to last until 2014, but thanks to lower food prices, it looked likely that the increased benefits could extend into 2015 or even 2018. It was a win-win situation: Congress spent the same amount, and poor families benefited for another few years.
Then Congress realized this was happening and immediately saw a way to cut SNAP. In August, the House and Senate passed an emergency bill to save public school teachers’ jobs and decided that the best way to fund this was by taking $12 billion from SNAP. If nothing changes, the increase will end abruptly in 2014, leaving families to face a sudden drop in income. The White House took another shot at the program last month, by pushing Michelle Obama’s childhood nutrition bill, which is funded by a $2.2 billion cut in SNAP. You read that right: The Obama administration wants to give poor kids healthy food in school by denying them food at home.
Thankfully, a group of House liberals killed that bill, but, if Republicans take over after November, more successful raids on SNAP could come, and they’ll be bipartisan raids to boot. The Washington Independent’s Annie M. Lowrey ’06-’07 estimated last month that passed and pending legislation from Democrats included a total of $27 billion in SNAP cuts. For context, the stimulus’s increase in SNAP funding totaled only $20 billion.
Policymakers could have paid for the teacher jobs bill by any number of less noxious mechanisms. They could have, for instance, canceled one of the Pentagon’s many wasteful purchases—the Sustainable Defense Task Force, a group of national security experts, has identified almost $1 trillion in wasteful spending that could be cut over the next decade. Eliminating the unnecessary F-35 fighter jet program, for example, would net $48 billion, more than enough for the teacher jobs program.
Or Congress could have cut the mortgage interest deduction, which serves mainly as a subsidy for rich homeowners and was a major contributor to the housing crisis. Even just limiting the amount of mortgage interest wealthy homeowners can deduct would save $208 billion over a decade. Congress could even just finance proposals like the teacher jobs bill or the childhood nutrition initiative through deficit spending. With interest rates low and the economy precarious enough that any budget cuts could hurt, the case for debt-financed spending has rarely been stronger.
Instead, Congress opted to make the most morally repugnant cut they could. But you don’t have to be a bleeding heart to object. There’s a strong economic argument for preserving, and indeed boosting, food stamps. Mark Zandi, a Moody’s economist, has used sophisticated modeling to determine which stimulus policies provide the most “bang for the buck”—that is, how a much a dollar of stimulus spending adds to the economy. The very best stimulus program, he found, is food stamps. A dollar spent on food stamps puts $1.74 back into the economy. For comparison, infrastructure spending puts back $1.57 for every dollar, and extending the Bush tax cuts contributes a measly $0.32.
If we want to get the economy humming again at as low a cost as possible, then, increasing food stamp funding is the way to go. In the meantime, however, Congress is treating the program as its personal piggy bank.

Following the lead of New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Cambridge officials are considering a ban on smoking in some public spaces. Both Bloomberg and members of the Cambridge City Council cite health risks associated with secondhand smoke, but studies of the actual effects of outdoor smoke are scarce and their findings are limited. A ban on smoking in city parks, then, seems excessive. We urge the Council to abandon the proposal.
At the moment, Cambridge’s ban is in its infancy: The City Manager and the Public Health Department are still investigating the feasibility of enacting it, and a hearing on the issue will not take place until later this year. The Bloomberg plan on which it is based is likely to cover “parks, beaches, marinas, boardwalks and pedestrian plazas throughout the city,” and violators will probably have to pay fines on the order of $50. But it is not clear what the scope of a Cambridge version of the ban would be or how it would be enforced.
With specifics occupying the city’s attention, the actual justification for a policy change seems to have been rather rashly presupposed. Councilor Marjorie Decker, who proposed the measure and rallied the unanimous support of the City Council last week, insists that “anyone who is in a publicly funded space like a park should have a reasonable level of confidence that they are in a toxic-free zone.” This assumes that the smoking allowed under current policy creates dangerously toxic environments, which is unproven and probably untrue.
Of course, the adverse health effects of some forms of secondhand smoke should not be ignored. Smoke-filled indoor establishments bring undeniable harm to non-smoking patrons and workers alike, and we wholeheartedly support current prohibitions on smoking in the workplace. But what little evidence exists on the matter suggests that outdoor smoking generally exposes bystanders to dramatically lower toxin levels than indoor smoking.
One finding, occasionally quoted in favor of restricting outdoor smoking, comes from a 2007 controlled experiment by Stanford researchers. The Boston Herald has summarized that finding with the claim that “Within 2 feet, second-hand smoke exposure is just as bad outside as inside.” This is important information and might be relevant to any attempts to regulate crowded sidewalk cafes, but it hardly justifies the proposed ban. We rarely find ourselves within arm’s length of strangers in public parks for prolonged periods and could easily walk away if we did.
More relevant to this issue is the observation by one of the Stanford study’s authors that “When you go a little distance or stay upwind, the exposure [to toxins] goes way down.” The same researcher speculates that being surrounded by people smoking could produce significant ill effects. But here in Cambridge, parks are big enough and smokers few enough that such a scenario is unlikely even without the proposed ban.
We support the restrictions on smoking already in place throughout the state, and the City Council need not impose this additional one on residents. To do so would be not only paternalistic but also unnecessary. In this case, Cambridge would do well not to follow in the footsteps of New York City.

Football is a game of attrition; after it is all said and done, it is the team that lasts the longest, the one that keeps on playing its game even after its opponent has given its all and fallen short, that pulls through with a win.
Last Saturday’s matchup between Harvard and Cornell had serious implications for both teams’ chances to grab the Ancient Eight title this season, as both squads entered the game with 0-1 records against other Ivy League opponents. The Crimson (3-1, 1-1 Ivy) was able to distance itself from the Big Red (1-3, 0-2) in the fourth quarter, notching its first conference victory of the season, 31-17, at Harvard Stadium.
“Using this game to vault into the rest of the Ivy League schedule was our main focus,” said junior defensive end Ben Graeff.
Both teams started slowly on offense, with neither side being able to score on its first two possessions. But after a three-and-out from the visitors, the Crimson took over with great field position. Senior running back Gino Gordon capped off the ensuing 46-yard drive with a 19-yard run into the endzone, giving Harvard the lead. These would be the only points scored by either team in the first half.
The story of the first half of the game lay not in the offense, but in the special teams and the defense of the Crimson. Sophomore Jacob Dombrowski had five punts for 229 yards, a 45.8-yard average. The punter proved instrumental in giving the Big Red offense poor field position on its side of the field with two touchbacks and two punts inside the 20-yard line.
“Our young specialist guys like Jake Dombrowski have really, under pressure, become good football players,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Early in the game...we got a couple of great field position [spots] out of our punt team, and it kept us in the game.”
Meanwhile, the Crimson continued to play stout defense in the first two quarters. Cornell was unable to convert on third or fourth downs and was limited to 80 yards of total offense on 29 plays. Junior defensive back Matthew Hanson had an interception that immediately killed a Big Red drive after Harvard turned the ball over on downs by failing to convert on fourth and two.
Midway through the third quarter, sophomore running back Treavor Scales cut through the middle of the defense before exploding to the left, exploiting a hole in the Cornell secondary for a 51-yard run, leading to a 25-yard field goal from freshman David Mothander.
The Big Red would answer back at the end of third quarter, sacking sophomore quarterback Colton Chapple and forcing a fumble on the Crimson’s five-yard line, but the visitors were held to just a field goal.
After seeing only one touchdown scored in the first three quarters, the teams combined for a total of five touchdowns in the fourth, with four of the five scoring drives taking less than 90 seconds each.
“If we hang in long enough, we’re going to get some big [plays],” Murphy said. “We knew that coming in, it just took us a while to get going.”
On Harvard’s first drive of the last quarter, the offense marched 87 yards down the field, ending on a 21-yard touchdown pass from Chapple to junior wide receiver Levi Richards.
The Crimson’s next drive ended with yet another score, this time on the ground as sophomore running back Rich Zajeski rushed for 43 yards to the endzone on his first carry of the afternoon, putting Harvard up by 21 points.
The Big Red responded on its ensuing drive, scoring on a 13-yard touchdown pass from freshman quarterback Jeff Mathews to junior tight end Ryan Houska. Cornell was unable to tack on the extra point, though, as senior kicker Brad Greenway had his point after blocked by sophomore Nnamdi Obukwelu, Greenway’s first missed attempt of the season.
The home team would answer with a big 65-yard run from Gordon that put the Crimson over 300 yards rushing for the second straight week. The drive ended with a two-yard touchdown run for Chapple. In his second start for Harvard, Chapple would finish the day with 191 yards passing on 16 of 35 attempts with one touchdown and two interceptions.
“We’re trying to help Colton out as much as we can,” said senior offensive lineman Chris Leroy. “He’s doing a great job, he’s being a great leader, he knows where to go [and] what to do.”
The Big Red scored another touchdown with four seconds to play and the contest already well out of reach.
“Physically, we just couldn’t hold up in the second half,” Cornell coach Kent Austin said. “Our defense got tired. The offense didn’t do enough in the first half really to keep our defense off the football field.”
The Big Red’s struggles came at the hands of Harvard’s new-look defense. With injuries to key players, the Crimson was still able to step up, recording eight sacks, with four from Graeff alone. The defense held Cornell to 208 yards of total offense, compared to 505 yards for Harvard.
With the victory, the Crimson moves to 1-1 in the Ivy League, keeping the team in the hunt for the Ancient Eight crown.
“We know we’re going to have some real hard times,” Murphy said. “You just move on...and we’re going to find out what we’re made of...I know this team will fight. That’s three quarters of the battle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s tennis wrapped up the USTA Billie Jean Invitational in Flushing, N.Y. yesterday.
As a whole, the team did not perform as well as it would have liked, but the tournament provided many positives for the team.
“I think we’re going in the right direction,” co-captain Samantha Rosekrans said. “We only had half of our team here this weekend. We have a very deep squad this year, and we have strong leadership from the sophomores and juniors.”
“We have more experience this year,” the co-captain continued. “I think we will have a strong showing at regionals [starting Oct. 22].”
Rosekrans battled throughout the weekend, defeating Charleston Southern’s Marija Dzakovic, 6-1, 6-2, losing to Cornell’s Christina Ordaway in a tie break, 6-3, 5-7, 11-9, and also falling to Liberty’s Jordan Jenkins, 6-4, 6-1.
“I probably didn’t play the greatest, because I haven’t been practicing singles,” Rosekrans said. “But overall it was a good tournament. It’s a great experience to play at the U.S. Open courts, and the weather was great for us all weekend. The competition was pretty solid.”
Crimson coach Traci Green echoed this sentiment, also expressing confidence in the team’s captain.
“Sam hasn’t played a lot of singles this semester, so I feel like she’s still really rusty,” Green said. “She’s working on things in her game. I’m really not worried about her at all.”
Junior Samantha Gridley played the strongest in singles competition this weekend for Harvard, winning all three of her matches, as well as her flight.
Gridley defeated Army’s Annie Hang, 6-1, 6-1, in the quarterfinals, Columbia’s Tiana Takenaga in the semifinals, 6-2, 6-2, and Binghamton’s Marina Bykovskaya, 6-3, 7-5, in the final.
“I knew I wanted to be really focused and be consistent,” Gridley said. “I wanted to limit my errors. In the match, [Bykovskaya] was a little more feisty then the other opponents I played. She made a couple tight calls. In the end, it was a battle of will, but I was able to pull it out.”
Gridley, playing in her first tournament this year, was happy to start her season with such success. The junior was especially happy with her performance in the final, in which she came back from a 5-1 second-set deficit.
“It’s a confidence builder to win matches and tournaments. I know I can pull out a match when I’m down by a lot now. It gives me confidence that I can fight out any match.”
Gridley’s play equally impressed Green.
“Samantha Gridley competed extremely well this weekend,” Green said. “It was great to see that her hard work in practice paid off. She was great in all her matches, and she had that ‘never say die’ attitude throughout the tournament.”
Gridley’s play also impressed her teammates, especially Rosekrans.
“We watched her play the finals today—stellar performance overall. She had a really long match and fought it out. She came back from being down in the second set, so we were all very proud,” Rosekrans said.
Green viewed the invitational as another method of preparation for the approaching regionals competition, which will be a key tournament for Crimson tennis this fall.
“This was only our second tournament for some people,” Green said. “Hopefully we can put the time in over the next couple weeks training-wise so we can challenge at regionals. We competed fairly well this weekend. I feel like we were still rusty and definitely need to put some time in over the next couple weeks to prepare for the tournaments ahead.”
Freshman Natalie Blosser teamed up with classmate Hannah Morrill to go 2-1 in doubles. In singles, both Morrill and Blosser went 2-1 as well. Sophomore Alex Lehman lost the two matches she completed but advanced in one due to her opponent’s injury.
Gridley and Lehman paired in doubles, defeating Diamond Adams and Nakita Austin of St. John’s in the round of 16, 8-2.
The tandem then topped Fairleigh Dickinson’s Egzona Morina and Julia Prantl in the quarterfinals, 8-5, before falling to Boston College’s Alex Kelleher and Erina Kikuchi in the semifinals, 8-0.
The tough play of Gridley’s teammates inspired her, though she also saw room for improvement.
“I think there were a few nerves on the first day, especially for the freshmen, but it was great to see people improve,” Gridley said. “Alex had a tough match the first day but then came out and played strong the next day. And same with Natalie and Sam [Rosekrans].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard hopes the maxim that defense wins championships holds true, especially considering its defensive performance on Saturday against Cornell. In its first Ivy League matchup since the Sept. 25 loss to Brown, the Crimson looked to reenergize its pursuit of the Ivy crown. Although missing key starters on both sides of the ball due to injuries, including sophomore defensive back D.J. Monroe and senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, Harvard’s defensive line stepped up and established dominance over the Big Red offense. The performance of the men up front allowed the Crimson to maintain its lead throughout the game, despite three offensive turnovers by Harvard in the first half.
“Obviously it wasn’t a pretty one for much of the game,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I thought our defensive and special teams players and coaches really kept us in the game until our offense came alive a little bit in the second half. I’m really proud of how our kids persevered even though we have to correct a lot of things. It was sloppy at times, but the effort was outstanding.”
On the game, the Harvard defense held Cornell to a meager 2.8 yards per play. By effectively shutting down the Big Red rushing game—Cornell rushed for only 69 yards on 36 carries—the Crimson was able to direct its efforts towards Big Red freshman quarterback Jeff Mathews. Harvard’s defensive line, led by junior defensive end Ben Graeff, placed Mathews under constant pressure, sacking the Cornell quarterback eight times—four by Graeff, his career best.
“We talked about [pass rushing] during the week and kind of set up some different packages and blitzes for that,” Graeff said. “But a lot of our sacks came out of just beating them one-on-one. We were playing base defense for most of the game, so just kind of line up and beat the guy in front of you.”
PENALTY PROBLEMS
Though self-flagellation is often associated with fringe Buddhist monastic orders, the Crimson suffered from self-inflicted wounds with a number of penalties. Over the course of the game, Harvard registered 11 penalties for 85 yards, including one holding call that erased a 50-yard rush by Gordon. Also on special teams, the Crimson handed the Big Red offense favorable field position twice, after an illegal block and late hit on the Cornell punt returner.
Although Harvard walked away the victor, the amount of penalties and their timing during the game proved to be a major concern for the Crimson coaching staff.
“We’ve been really a Jekyll and Hyde team in that regard,” Murphy said. “Two of the games, we’ve been almost perfect in terms of ball security and penalties, and two of the games we’ve been really sloppy. And I have to figure out what the correlation is, but there’s no excuse for it. We’re not a team that’s used to that, we’re not a team that can win doing that, so we have to get it squared away.”
BORN TO RUN
It’s no secret that senior Gino Gordon, an All-Ivy first-teamer a year ago, is a good running back. For the second consecutive game, Gordon rushed for over 100 yards to bring his season total to 389 yards in four games. Even so, Harvard did not have to rely on Gordon alone. The senior was assisted by his fellow backs—sophomores Treavor Scales and Rich Zajeski, who combined for 150 yards on the ground. Scales and Zajeski were notable for their explosive runs. Scales reeled off a 51-yard rush in one play, and Zajeski similarly broke for a 43-yard touchdown.
“It’s always fun blocking for those guys, all three, Gino, Treavor, and [Zajeski],” said senior offensive lineman Brent Osborne. “They always do a great job. If they keep pounding and keep pounding, eventually they’re going to break one of those plays.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard field hockey travelled 3,000 miles to play its games this weekend, but the team’s troubles stayed right where they were.
The Crimson lost two games, one on Friday and one on Sunday, to drop to a 3-9 record. Its Friday game was a mismatch—No. 17 Stanford (8-3, 3-1 NorPac) beat Harvard, 6-0, thanks to a five-goal second half.
Against California (6-6, 4-0 NorPac) on Sunday, the Crimson kept the game more competitive, but two second-half goals proved too much of a deficit, and Harvard’s comeback came too little, too late in a 3-2 loss.
With its two losses in the Golden State, the Crimson has lost its last four games and nine of its last 10.
“[We have to make] sure that we have the proper build-up from the back to the front,” sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “That’ll be something we work on. And another part of that is keeping the ball away from the defense.”
CALIFORNIA 3, HARVARD 2
In contrast to its game against the Cardinal, Harvard kept its game against Cal close throughout. With about seven minutes left in the first half, sophomore Emma Keller scored—the Crimson’s first goal in its last three games—to tie the contest at one.
But as had happened two days before, Harvard could not compete with a strong performance from the California team in the last 35 minutes. The Bears outshot the Crimson, 12-4, in the second half.
Tassopoulos put forth a solid performance, saving six of eight shots on goal in the last frame, but Harvard’s second goal with six minutes left wasn’t enough support for the Crimson keeper.
“She really has great communication back there,” said sophomore Nina Kucharczyk of the team’s goalie. “She really does a good job keeping the defense where they should be...She’s making a lot of high saves with her stick.”
Harvard last scored more than two goals over a month ago, when it defeated Bryant, 5-2. The team has managed just eight goals in the 10 games since then.
Keller and junior Georgia McGillivray scored the team’s two goals, giving them five and three, respectively, on the season. Senior Chloe Keating had an assist, her team-leading fifth of the year. Freshman Christy Haughey picked up her second assist this season.
For Cal, the one-goal margin is not indicative of the dominance with which it played, especially in the second half. All but one of its starters, excluding the goalie, had at least one shot on goal. The Crimson couldn’t manage its first shot until 20 minutes into the second half, though it got within one goal towards the end of the game.
“[Against] Cal, we didn’t have too many [shots], but we made sure they were goals when we did take them,” Tassopoulos said.
NO. 17 STANFORD 6, HARVARD 0
Stanford shut down Harvard’s offense, handing the team its fifth shutout in eight games.
The Cardinal jumped out of the gate, scoring in the first 90 seconds of the game. But the Crimson kept the score close for the rest of the half, though Stanford still outshot the team, 8-2, in the first 35 minutes.
Harvard’s defense couldn’t hold the nationally-ranked team in the second half, and its offense could not get anything going against a Cardinal team that has allowed more than two goals just twice this year.
“I think we had a little bit of a rough time against Stanford,” Kucharczyk said. “We played a really great first half, and then we had trouble coming back after they scored their second goal.”
Stanford took 14 shots in the second half and held the Crimson shotless in the same time period.
For the first time since last season, Tassopoulos allowed more than four goals in a game. She did manage 11 saves to tie her season high in that category.
“We played them really well in the first half—it was only 1-0,” Tassopoulos said. “I think in the second half, we got caught back on our heels, and they were able to get more scoring opportunities and, unfortunately, they were able to capitalize on pretty much all of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing a woeful team can do wonders for your stat sheet, but Harvard coach Tim Murphy knows that it does little for his team’s Ivy title prospects.
The Crimson dominated an overmatched opponent for the second week in a row, rolling over Cornell Saturday to the tune of 314 yards on the ground and 505 total, but the offensive onslaught didn’t mask some lingering problems for a banged-up football team.
“I’m not really happy, because we don’t worry about yards, we don’t worry about points—the only thing we care about is how well we protect the football,” Murphy said. “If we protect the football well, the other stuff will happen.”
The coach was referring to three ugly turnovers in the contest—two on interceptions, when sophomore Colton Chapple tried to thread passes into tight spaces, and one on a fumble when the signal caller held the ball for too long. While these mistakes didn’t cost Harvard in a lopsided blowout, they will almost certainly be magnified against tougher Ancient Eight foes.
And this is what has Murphy so worried. With unprecedented injuries forcing new starters onto every inch of the field, the Crimson knows that it can’t rely on pure talent to get by opponents—starting with Chapple, the team needs to return to the mistake-free style that Murphy prizes.
Of course, Harvard is far from doomed in the Ivy League race. Despite missing his top two wideouts in seniors Chris Lorditch and Marco Iannuzzi, Chapple made many more plays than he did errors. The sophomore completed 16 of 35 passes for 191 yards a week after he was limited to just 11 attempts, and Chapple’s most encouraging moment came in the fourth quarter, immediately after his fumble on the Crimson five-yard line led to Cornell’s first score. Rather than give in to frustration, the young quarterback marched his team right back down the field, capping the drive with a perfect spiral down the left sideline to junior Levi Richards on a playaction pass, staking Harvard to a 17-3 lead.
“To his credit, especially, Colton Chapple, he hung in there,” Murphy said. “At halftime, we had struggled mightily as an offense, and he had struggled a bit, but the way he played in the second half just in terms of leadership and mental toughness—the kid’s going to be a player.”
The Crimson knows, then, that one piece of the puzzle is in place: the team will get its points one way or another. But not until the turnovers stop—and the defense stops having to protect short fields—will Harvard once again emerge as a team to fear.
“This is a very solid football team, Cornell that we played, but we’re going to play a lot better offensive football teams that will present more challenges,” Murphy warned on Saturday.
Indeed, holding Columbia or Penn out of the endzone from five yards away will be a much taller order, but the defense has proven that, even with two starting cornerbacks and two linebackers sidelined, in the right setting it can hold up just fine. On Cornell’s first two drives, when sophomore punter Jacob Dombrowski pinned the Big Red deep in its own territory, the Crimson forced a turnover on downs and a three and out. Cornell’s pair of touchdowns only came in garbage time, with the contest well out of reach.
Thus, Murphy’s message to his team is clear: play smart, protect the football, and the rewards will come. Harvard won’t rack up 500 yards against the Quakers, and the defense will not put up a shutout—if the Crimson looks to win that contest, it will be in very close fashion where one or two big plays make the difference. But if Harvard does the little things right the rest of the season, it will have done enough to win out.
The Crimson’s roster may be riddled with injuries, but as Chapple grows, and the offensive and defensive units become more comfortable with new starters, there is reason to believe that Harvard can at least share a league crown. Murphy has been to the top before, and if the squad can play his brand of football, the Crimson can certainly get there again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am so excited. It’s coming. Can you feel it? We’re on the cusp!
Imagine a world where you could effortlessly access absolutely anything you needed on the go through ultra-portable, ultra-energy-efficient, web-enabled, always-on devices. But you’re saying: “Wait, can’t I already do that?” Sure, iPhones and the like have the World Wide Web covered when you’re on foot, and laptops with Wi-Fi have been doing a standup job for almost a decade now—when there’s a latte and a place to sit. But the next frontier, and arguably the most important one, is having access to all our own digital material—the essays, presentations, pictures, videos, and songs that are so essential to our digital lives—all the time. And I mean all of it, all the time: no blackouts, no missing files, no dead batteries. It’ll all be at our fingertips whenever we want!
Now maybe in your mind, the prospect doesn’t quite warrant that exclamation point. But just think: Gone will be the days when you realize the essay you emailed yourself (or uploaded to Google Docs) isn’t the most current version. You’ll never have to sit and stare hopelessly at the “Save” or “Save and Replace” dialogue box, wondering if one copy of your presentation has everything that the other one does, or less, or more, or is just different altogether.
In today’s world, it still takes a fair amount of work to be seamlessly connected, integrated, and up-to-date wherever you are and on whatever machine. It certainly isn’t impossible, but it’s neither effortless nor reliable. I’m imagining a world where I start typing a paper in my dorm room on a beautifully big monitor hooked up to an inexpensive-but-powerful desktop that puts today’s costly laptops to shame. A quick “Ctrl-S, Alt-F4” before I run outside, pull out my phone, wrap up the conclusion, and instant message it to my English-concentrating friend while on my way to Lamont. There I take out my two-and-a-half pound tablet-book thing, throw in her edits, and give it all one final read through before printing and running to Sever. Awesome.
The idea of uploading files one-by-one to a service like Google Docs or worse, emailing myself, is laughable in comparison. It is unacceptable that the average user still has to understand the complexities of the so-called “cloud” before streamlining his digital life. By now, computers ought to be doing it for us automagically.
I can think of only one company that’s in a position to rapidly accomplish precisely what I envision. It’s not a name the many hipsters on this campus are going to like: Microsoft.
Windows Live, SkyDrive, Windows, Office, and Office Web Apps—all the services are there already, but what’s left is to seamlessly bring them together.
Office is where you create; Windows is your total user experience (and, let’s be real, already the file manager of choice for everyone, everywhere); SkyDrive is your storage in the cloud; and Windows Live is your digital passport to all of the above.
Microsoft has had the potential to streamline its customers’ digital lives for a while now but hasn’t been doing a very good job. The boys in Redmond need to get it together, and fast. Internet-based operating systems from powerful online-only companies like Google are well on their way. If they secure even a modest foothold before a more connected and user-friendly version of everything Microsoft emerges, the market for individual services will fragment. Uniform adoption of a totally new suite of offerings from a company like Google, while perhaps plausible in wealthy and iconoclastic America, is less so globally. If Microsoft doesn’t step up, the great specter of a costly Internet-standards war will stand between us and worldwide digital integration on a common network that seamlessly connects us with our personal data and with each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team traveled to Plymouth Meeting, Pa., last weekend for its penultimate tournament of the fall.
The Crimson was part of a 21-team field that came together for the Big 5 Invitational. Harvard tied with Dartmouth for 12th place in the event, finishing behind Yale, Princeton, and Penn, but topping Brown and Cornell.
“We came into the tournament very optimistic,” freshman Seiji Liu said. “It was the best field by far that we’ve faced...[We] struggled a bit. I can’t really explain why. I don’t know. Golf is just one of those things where anything can happen.”
The Big 5 Invitational, hosted by the Philadelphia Big 5—Penn, LaSalle, St. Joseph’s, Temple, and Villanova—took place at the par-70 Plymouth Country Club. Designed in 1912 by William S. Flynn, the course proved difficult for most of the Crimson golfers.
“Plymouth Country Club was an extremely difficult golf course,” Liu said. “They cut two of the par fives into par fours, so they were extremely long. And it [had] a narrow tree line where any off-line shot would be penalized badly. And then the greens were tiny, slopey, fast, and hard.”
The one golfer who seemingly had no trouble was Liu. The freshman started off slowly with two double-bogeys and a bogey in his first five holes on Saturday, but he recovered to shoot a +2 for the opening round. Liu followed up that performance with a -1 on Sunday. On the back nine of his final round, he carded a 33.
“It started after the sixth hole of the first round,” Liu said of his rally on Saturday. “I saw that [one of my teammates] had played poorly on one or two of the holes that I messed up on as well...I realized that I really needed to start something and get it going to contribute to my team...That made all the difference.”
The freshman finished the tournament tied for third place with Binghamton’s Jake Katz, trailing only Kentucky’s Joseph Barr (E) and Furman’s Matthew Broome (-7).
Liu’s result signaled a nice recovery from his play at the MacDonald Cup last weekend, where he shot a +15.
“As always with freshmen, it’s getting used to the college atmosphere, and I’d definitely say Seiji is a little more comfortable now, and that definitely helped him play better this week,” junior captain Tony Grillo said.
The rest of the Harvard golf team did not fare nearly as well as Liu. Grillo and freshman Theo Lederhausen showed consistency, each shooting a 76 and a 74, but their +10 was only good enough to tie for 42nd place out of the 111 competitors. Junior Mark Pollak and Connor Wentzell shot a +17 and +18, respectively.
“We’re a little disappointed,” Grillo said. “We feel that this whole season, especially with this last tournament, has been very mediocre.”
The Crimson, which took sixth place in the event last year, was bested on the leader board by several of its conference rivals.
The Quakers finished two strokes ahead of Harvard in ninth place, the Bulldogs tied for fifth with 587 strokes, and the Tigers, which had four golfers place in the top 36, tied for third to pace the Ivy League squads.
Yale has now beaten the Crimson in three straight events this year.
“In the back of our minds, [beating the Bulldogs] is one of our goals,” Liu said. “But when we approach tournaments, we’re not really thinking about our opponents. We just want to perform the best we can against the course.”
Furman won the Big 5 Invitational in a dominant fashion. Its final tally of 574 was eight strokes better than St. John’s runner-up score. Kentucky (583) and Binghamton (587), along with Princeton and Yale, rounded out the top five.
With its 12th-place finish this week and its seventh-place finishes in the McLaughlin and the MacDonald Cup earlier this season, Harvard enters the fall’s final event next week—the Northeast Invitational—still looking to crack the top five in a tournament. But Liu is confident that his squad is up to the task.
“We’re looking forward to the final tournament next week,” he said. “We would love to get a win, because all eight Ivy League teams will come together for the first time on a very difficult venue. This will be a nice preview to the Ivy League championship in the spring.”
“We know if we play well we will win,” Grillo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team was two minutes away from securing its second straight Ivy League win, when Cornell’s Chase Aaronson got off a shot that tied the game for good.
The ball was thrown in from the left into the penalty box but was kicked away, only to find the foot of Aaronson, who shot on goal. The Crimson (4-3-4, 1-0-1 Ivy) couldn’t do anything about the ball that somehow made it past the congested penalty area and went straight to the left bottom corner of the net. The Big Red (3-3-4, 0-1-1 Ivy), playing at Ohiri Field on Saturday, took the game to double overtime with that shot and salvaged a 1-1 draw from what seemed to be an imminent loss.
“Credit to Cornell for sticking to their game plan,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “That was how they hoped to get their goal this game and they did. When you have someone that can throw the ball in from that far, they put a lot of pressure on your goal, and eventually that pressure paid off for them.”
Earlier in the game, the Crimson went up on the scoreboard thanks to a great back-and-forth between junior Ben Tsuda and freshman Kyle Henderson. Tsuda received the ball wide left and played it in to Henderson in the middle. Tsuda quickly ran into the penalty area and received a pass back from Henderson.
The junior’s cut to the middle freed him up for a shot on goal which the goalie blocked, but the rebound fell to Tsuda’s feet once more, and this time the midfielder put it away. Tsuda kicked the ball into the ground so that the bounce would fly over the goalie, a nifty finish from inside the box with 29 minutes left to play.
The team that Junot fielded against Cornell had two notable absences. Sophomore forward Brian Rogers and junior defender Baba Omosegbon were out with injuries sustained in the past week. Rogers dislocated his arm in last week’s matchup against Yale, and Omosegbon hasn’t featured for the Crimson in the past two games due to a muscle strain. Junot expects to have both players back for next week’s matchup at No. 13 Brown.
The first half belonged to the Crimson, as the home side outshot the Big Red, 7-3. As the period progressed, Harvard’s possession of the ball became increasingly dangerous, setting up opportunities for freshman forward Connor McCarthy and junior midfielder Jamie Rees.
With 16 minutes left in the first half, a pass from just outside the box into the penalty area released Rees for a potential shot on goal, but he stopped the ball behind him and was moving too fast to stop himself, falling to the ground frustrated with the lost opportunity.
Only a couple of minutes later, Henderson took a free kick that almost connected with McCarthy’s head, but the ball sailed a little too high for the freshman forward.
Cornell came out running in the second half, setting up a couple of dangerous plays through the use of long throw-ins.
In the 51st minute, a long Big Red throw-in flew past the numerous players gathered in the penalty area and rebounded off a player, going straight at the goal before a defender was able to clear it out.
In a subsequent play, another long throw-in resulted in a frenzy to clear the ball, and a Cornell played waiting outside the box was able to get a final shot off that went high over the crossbar.
The Crimson slowly regained possession, and Henderson tested the goalie with 32 minutes to play, but Big Red goalkeeper Rick Pflasterer easily scooped up his shot.
Three minutes later, Tsuda converted the only goal of the match for Harvard.
“I think the attack was good,” Tsuda said. “We put it on Cornell a lot. We possessed the ball most of the time, and towards the end we were absorbing a lot of their long throws and fighting through it, but we did pretty well overall except that little mistake.”
Cornell’s tying score with 1:46 left to play led to two overtime periods in which Harvard created several opportunities but couldn’t find the back of the net.
“We just have a lot of experience with overtime, so I told them it’s a position we’ve been in this season and that you can’t predict the outcome of the game,” Junot said. “But every overtime we’ve been in, I feel like we’ve created three or four opportunities to win the game, and the question is whether we were going to capitalize on one of those three or four opportunities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several things were unusual about the Harvard men’s and women’s lacrosse teams’ exhibition matchups from this past weekend. For one, the contests were played in October, nearly five months before the lacrosse season officially kicks off.
But what may have been even more out of the ordinary were the Crimson’s two opponents—the U.S. Men’s and Women’s National Teams.
Saturday night through Sunday afternoon, Harvard played host to the U.S. Lacrosse Stars and Stripes Weekend, an annual event that pits college teams against the U.S. Senior National Teams.
While both Crimson squads came up short in their exhibition matches—the men losing, 17-12, on Sunday afternoon, and the women falling, 17-4, Saturday night—players, fans, and coaches were happy that Harvard had the opportunity to host some of the world’s top talent.
“I think first off, it was an unbelievable opportunity,” said Crimson men’s coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “[The U.S. Men’s National Team] only plays five or six college teams, so just to be in that select group of colleges and to get that opportunity was a great experience for our kids. Most Division I players never get that chance.”
And the Crimson players capitalized on that chance, hanging with the national team until late in the contest, which took place at Harvard Stadium in front of more than 1,000 fans.
Throughout the first 48 minutes of play, neither team was able to pull ahead, as the score was knotted at 11 with less than 12 minutes on the clock.
While Harvard never led in the contest, the squad managed to keep it tight by responding with timely scores, thanks in large part to the efforts of co-captain Dean Gibbons, who finished with four goals and two assists in the first three quarters of play.
After the national team’s Chazz Woodson put his team up by two in the final seconds of the third quarter, the Crimson responded once again, evening the score at 11 with back-to-back scores from junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan and senior Matt Hull early in the fourth.
But Team USA quickly rebounded, finding the back of the net again less than two minutes later to take the 12-11 lead. This time, Harvard was unable to respond, as the national team went on a 6-0 run over the next 11 minutes of play to pull out the victory.
“I was really happy with the intensity and the effort,” Wojcik said. “We go into each game preparing to win, but I think there was a bigger picture. We’re disappointed that we lost, but I’m happy, and I’m proud of how the team played.”
U.S. midfielders Max Seibald and Paul Rabil—two key pieces of the national squad that won the 2010 Federation of International Lacrosse World Championship in July—led their team once again, notching five and four scores, respectively.
On the women’s side, the Crimson also had its hands full with a group of national stars in its matchup played under the lights at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
Jillian Byers—the NCAA’s second leading scorer from 2009—and Danielle Spencer—the third leading scorer from the Northwestern team that reached the 2010 NCAA championship—combined for seven scores to lead the U.S. to the 17-4 win.
Harvard sophomore Micaela Cyr scored twice for the Crimson, but the national team’s aggressive defense and solid play in goal made it difficult for Harvard to generate much scoring.
“They are definitely a fast team, which helps us prepare for the season,” sophomore Danielle Tetreault said. “If we want to bump up into the top 10, we have to be able to play fast like the U.S. team can.”
Harvard coach Lisa Miller agreed that the contest would help prepare the Crimson for the upcoming season.
“I think it’s just good to play at a higher level,” Miller said. “[The players] weren’t afraid. They just came out, and they played hard. That’s a good sign for the future.”
Miller, who is entering her fourth season as the Crimson head coach, was largely responsible for getting the U.S. National Teams to visit Cambridge. Miller said Harvard was a “natural fit” to host the event given the high concentration of national team players and coaches at schools in the Boston area.
In addition to the two Crimson teams and the two senior national teams, the U.S. Women’s U19 National Team, Boston College, Boston University, the Revolution Lacrosse Club, and the Mass Elite Lacrosse Club also sent squads to Cambridge to participate in the weekend’s festivities and participate in exhibition contests.
On top of their exhibition matchups, the two national teams held youth clinics on Sunday morning at Harvard Stadium and Cumnock Field.
“It was just a great overall weekend,” Wojcik said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Often faced with four or five regattas in one weekend, the Harvard sailing team took a bit of a break this week as midterm season has started here on campus. The Crimson sent a co-ed contingent to the Moody Trophy Regatta held in Rhode Island, where Harvard sailed away with a second-place team finish.
“We were able to continue to maintain our good, consistent results from throughout the fall this weekend,” junior skipper Brendan Kopp said.
The Crimson also had a group of female sailors compete at the Navy Fall Women’s Regatta held in Annapolis, Md., where Harvard placed 14th out of a field of 17. Senior Colin Santangelo also took to the waters this weekend for the Crimson, as the skipper competed individually at the New England Men’s Singlehanded Championships hosted by Yale.
MOODY TROPHY
Harvard’s top co-ed sailors traveled down to Rhode Island this weekend to compete in the Moody Trophy regatta, where the Crimson placed second in a field of 18 teams, bested only by its rivals from Yale.
Captain skipper Tedd Himler teamed up with fellow senior crew Quincy Bock to easily take home top honors in the A division of racing, finishing in the top two in six of the 13 races on the weekend.
Kopp and classmate crew William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, took home a fifth-place finish in the B division, just eight points out of third. The duo had six top-three finishes over the two days of competition.
“Teddy sailed really well in the A division,” Kopp said. “We were not particularly pleased with how things went in the B division. We thought we could have performed a little better, but we were still able to finish well as a team overall.”
NAVY FALL WOMEN’S REGATTA
Harvard’s lone women’s contingent on the weekend competed at the Navy Fall Women’s Regatta. The Crimson finished 14th in a 17-team field, as the sailors from Brown took home top honors from the two days of competition.
The junior duo of captain skipper Emily Lambert and crew Alexandra Jumper finished seventh in the A division of racing, as the pair closed out the 16 races on the weekend with a trio of top-three finishes.
Freshman skipper Caitlin Watson and junior crew Claire Miller finished 14th in the B division of racing, and freshman Morgan Russom placed 15th in the C division.
NEW ENGLAND MEN’S SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIPS
Colin Santangelo represented Harvard over the weekend at the New England Men’s Singlehanded Championships hosted by Yale on the Long Island Sound. While Santangelo placed last in the field of 20 individuals competing in Laser boats, this is primarily due to him not competing in 14 of the 18 races on the weekend due to the water and wind conditions.
“I have done pretty well at this regatta in the past,” Santangelo said, “so we decided to send me down there to compete in it again this year. I ended up being too light for the heavy winds, however, and therefore was not able to be really competitive. A Laser boat is designed for people weighing 180 pounds or more, and I only weigh 160, so the heavy winds gave me some problems.”
While the Crimson would have liked Santangelo to be able to place higher, Harvard should not be hurt to a large extent by not having a high finisher at this regatta.
“This regatta was not as much of a priority for our team this year,” Santangelo said. “We don’t have a traditional Laser sailor, so we were not relying too much on this regatta to gain points for the end of the year.”
Santangelo also echoed the importance of this weekend in providing some down time for the busy Crimson sailing team as it sets its sights on more important regattas later this year.
“We have a lot of new people on our team,” Santangelo said, “and you don’t want any of the up-and-comers to get burned out on collegiate sailing too soon, so it was nice for them to be able to use this weekend to catch up on work, relax a little, and recover and recuperate for more important regattas later this year. We have been doing well in all of our intersectional regattas so far this season and have set ourselves up to have a great year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a weekend of ups and downs for Harvard men’s water polo, which split its four games on Friday and Saturday at the Claremont Convergence Tournament in Claremont, Calif. and then lost, 15-6, at No. 5 UC Santa Barbara’s pool in a regular, non-conference game on Sunday.
The weekend marks the first time since 2004 that the Crimson (6-12, 0-2 CWPA North) has won more than one game on its annual trip to California.
UC SANTA BARBARA 15, HARVARD 6
Following the conclusion of the Claremont Convergence Tournament, the Crimson continued its streak of games in California against UCSB (9-4). The Gauchos came out strong and fast, jumping to a 6-0 lead and scoring on all four of their six-on-five opportunities in the first period.
UCSB continued with two more unanswered goals in the second period, until Harvard juniors Evan Zepfel and Kevin DiSilvestro each scored a goal within the final three minutes of the half.
The Gauchos outscored the Crimson, 7-4, over the rest of the game, resulting in Harvard’s nine-goal deficit. Despite the loss, Harvard coach Ted Minnis appreciated the opportunity to contend with a skilled team like UCSB.
“We learned a lot of lessons this weekend, especially playing one of the top teams in the nation,” Minnis said.
“[The Gauchos] anticipate very well, they counterattack very well, and they have good body positions and always try to finish the play,” senior Alex Thompson added. “Those were things we were able to observe, and now we can improve on ourselves.”
CLAREMONT-M-S 13, HARVARD 6
The Crimson fell 13-6 to the tournament’s host, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (8-7), earlier in the weekend.
Both Minnis and his team acknowledge the third period as the point that cost them the game. Harvard was outscored 5-1 in the period and was unable to recover, despite two goals each from junior Mike Katzer and freshman Neal O’Hara.
HARVARD 21, CALTECH 2
The Crimson was clearly ready for a victory Saturday morning, as shown by its performance against Caltech (0-11), in which Harvard routed the Beavers, 21-2, and set a season high for goals scored in a single game.
Caltech has had a rough start to the 2010 season, giving up more than 20 goals on at least six occasions. But the game was an opportunity for the Crimson’s younger athletes to take the spotlight for a game. Sophomore Antone Martinho led the team with five goals, while Katzer logged another four.
“During [the] Caltech [game], we were able to give playing time to a lot of guys who practice really hard and don’t really get as much playing time,” said Thompson, who led Harvard with five assists. “We were really happy to cheer for them from the bench, just like they cheer for us from the bench. It was really fun to see.”
POMONA-PITZER 10, HARVARD 9
Despite the Crimson’s early momentum in the tournament, the team fell 10-9 to No. 18 Pomona-Pitzer College (8-8) late Friday night.
According to Minnis, the loss was disappointing, but Harvard’s performance against the Sagehens was, in his opinion, the best of the weekend.
“We played four solid quarters against a ranked team, and we showed ourselves that we can play with those teams,” Minnis said.
Friday’s loss to Pomona-Pitzer was the fourth consecutive match in the series dating back to 2005 to go in favor of the Sagehens and be decided by three goals or less.
HARVARD 12, OCCIDENTAL 8
The Crimson kick-started its run through California with a 12-8 win over Occidental College (2-12) on Friday. Harvard was led by a strong performance from junior co-captain Luka Babic and senior Jeff Lee, who had a combined total of seven goals and five assists.
The Crimson commanded the first period, 5-3, and doubled its lead to 8-4 by halftime. The matchup against Occidental may have been a strong offensive effort from Harvard, which maintained the lead throughout the game, but the men attributed credit to the defense and junior goalie Alexandre Popp, who had eight saves and an assist.
“Our defense was definitely the key,” Thompson said. “[The team] really came together as a group in a lot of ways this weekend. It’s a lot about working as a unit and communicating with each other. It was a lot more cohesive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking into a gallery in Boston, you are confronted by a roomful of same-sex couples arm in arm—a group of people publicly announcing their same-sex love. Instead of the canvases gracing the walls, this scene is the work of art, part of a larger series entitled "PDA: Public Displays of Acceptance." The series itself is just one of three parts of an ongoing project called "The Wedlock Project," which aims to challenge the viewer’s perceptions of gay marriage. Two married artists TTBaum and Michael Grohall began the long series in 2009 in order to spread acceptance of homosexual matrimony.
"The Wedlock Project" is just one of many artistic events aimed at the queer community in Boston. As the capital of the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in November 2003, the city has long been one of the most accepting in the country for Americans with same-sex lifestyles. Its open-mindedness is clearly reflected by its burgeoning Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) artistic scene. Still, recent events on the national level—including the suicide of homosexual Rutgers freshman Tyler Clementi this September—have demonstrated that the United States is not entirely acccepting of its LGBT communities.
According to TTBaum and Grohall, art—whether it be theater, literature, visual art, or music—can be employed to alter antiquated perceptions of sexuality. The definition of ‘art’, like ‘sexuality’, is fluctuating and often ambiguous; its very fluidity lends it the power to promote active societal engagement with the complex issues like those associated with the homosexual community in America.
It might be surprising, then, to realize that Harvard—situated as it is amongst such a liberal population—seems to lack a great wealth of artistic productions and artistic organizations targeting issues of gender and sexuality at first glance. On closer inspection, though, H-BOMB Magazine, last year’s "ACT UP New York" exhibition at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, and other individual projects have sought to encourage discourse about sexuality. But in general, these works seem to garner little attention from the community at large. The lack may betray a certain level of discomfort with controversial issues of sexuality.
PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF ACCEPTANCE
TTBaum and Grohall, pioneers amongst the Boston LGBT Community, present a clear demonstration of how art can challenge perceptions of sexuality. Their ongoing project aims to inspire discourse on the controversy surrounding same-sex marriage through visual, performance, and community art.
"A lot of creativity comes from our sexuality," says TTBaum. "This is often the creative basis of my own body of work. We, as a same-sex couple, are constantly confronted with the question of how we look to the world at large."
According to TTBaum and Grohall, the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts triggered conflict within both the straight and LGBT communities--a conflict felt deeply by both artists. In "Wedlock" they seek to address these conflicts both personally and publicly.
"Gay marriage is very new in the social consciousness," says Grohall. "We don’t know how to deal with it; it doesnt really change the definition of marriage as much as it alters gender roles between equals. Thus we sought to both expose and resolve this conflict within ‘The Wedlock Project.’"
The project is composed of three consecutive parts: "Engagement," "PDA" and "Matrimony." The first part involved a month-long, multimedia exhibition in Boston’s Space 242, which showcased visual and performance artwork from TTBaum, Grohall, and six other artists. The entire enterprise opened with a live performance by the couple assuming their alter-egos, the Romeos. This performance—and indeed "Engagement" as a whole—sought to question the conventional bases of all male relationships.
The next stage of their venture engaged the public more actively. "Part Two, ‘PDA’, invited people in many different venues throughout Boston to come out and perform a public display of affection with a member of the same sex," Grohall says. "It encouraged the outsider to view this physical connection in a different light, and allowed the queer-identified people the opportunity to feel accepted by the community," he adds.
The third and final stage of the Wedlock Project is ongoing. "When we were first starting out," says Grohall, "there was a lot of controversy and a lot of confusion amongst the gay community in regards to the legalization of same-sex marriage. There was a struggle and a marked feeling of a loss of cultural identity." TTBaum and Grohall sought to create something positive from these chaotic reactions. "We have always been a community which takes tradition and makes it our own. Therefore ‘Matrimony’ is itself addressing the institution of marriage and an effort to prove to both the queer and straight communities that we can mold this institution into something which is ours, but also something very beautiful," says Grohall.
Both artists emphasize the importance of art not only as a creative outlet, but also as a medium for vital cultural discourse and social activism. To advance is social goals, the work is public and inclusive. "PDA" in particular demonstrates the ability of accessible art to engage viewers who would not usually identify with art directed towards the queer community. According to the artists, this form of art plays a vital role in the eradication of entrenched misconceptions and prejudices about the queer community.
ARTISTIC EXPERIMENTS
While Harvard may not showcase such direct artistic celebration of homosexuality, the campus does offer a range of support groups for LGBT students: these include Queer Students and Allies (QSA), the Jewish LGBT support group BAGELS, and Girlspot, an organization providing resources to the female questioning and lesbian communities. Although vital on campus, they are essentially bodies of social support without direct engagement with art.
Still, certain large-scale artistic events on campus have managed to fill the void left by the lack of specifically artistic LGBT organizations. Last year’s Carpenter Center exhibition entitled "ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS Crisis, 1987-1993" is one such potent example of the engaging power of creative art. The exhibit commemorated the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) movement of 1980s with both visual and performance art, incorporating a ream of images and posters from the gay rights movement and over 100 contemporary video interviews with surviving members of the ACT UP movement. The collection aimed to combat common misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, a disease still stigmatized due to its association with same-sex intercourse.
"ACT UP New York" is not the only recent creative work targeting perceptions of homosexuality at Harvard. April 2009 saw closeted Mormon Republicans take to the stage in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of "Angels in America" performed at the Loeb. The show—a Tony Kushner play first staged in the early 1990s—explored personal experiences of homosexuality in America.
While both "ACT UP New York" and "Angels in America" directly addressed issues of sexuality and the controversy surrounding it, their ability to engage the campus as a whole was limited due to their relative impermanence.
BREAKING THE ICE
The production of art specifically addressing sexuality on Harvard’s campus is also inevitably constrained by financial concerns. QSA attempts to promote artistic installations and events on campus with a focus on sexuality, but there is inevitably a limit to the reach of their funds.
"It is expensive to have someone fly in from another city. We do not have many artistic funds to draw from to exclusively promote artistic branches on campus, and these funds are limited because they are the same funds we use for the LGBT community," says QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11.
The creation and support of artistic performances responding to sexuality also faces greater obstacles of an entirely different nature: despite their universal interest, sex and sexuality are simply socially awkward topics. Thus, for the most part, it appears that the straight community at Harvard avoids both artistic and colloquial engagement with these issues. To soften the controversy associated with questions of sexuality, several productions on campus that touch on the subject couch it in humorous terms. More light-hearted treatment encourage the involvement of people who are unlikely to interact with sexuality in an emotionally targeted and reflective context like that of "ACT UP New York."
One such project, the Donkey Show, champions a comical transgression of gender representation in a setting of classic Shakespearean cross-dressing confusion. Produced by the American Repertory Theater in its OBERON club space on Arrow Street, the reimagining of William Shakespeare’s "A Midsummer Night’s Dream" benefits greatly from its informal night-club setting. The relaxed atmosphere allows the audience to feel comfortable and engaged with the theatrical action at once. Presented in a comedic context, its extreme promiscuity manages to avoid conventional societal disapproval. The show purposefully transgresses conventional male-female interactions in a bid to promote women’s empowerment. Heavily sexualized male fairies bridge the divide between the audience and the main action of the show, while female actors portray the main characters.
Assistant Director and former cast member Allegra Libonati reveled in the feeling of comic empowerment she found in playing Dimitri, the conventional masculine figure who objectifies women: "I remember playing Dimitri one night, in all of his sexual vanity and misogynistic evaluation of women, and coming off stage to have one woman yell ‘Jerk!’ at me. It was strange to have this female frustration so virulently projected upon my character. Yet it is empowering as a woman to play this role and to mock its superficiality and vileness," she says.
The Donkey Show is not, of course, the only performance on campus that capitalizes on the charged atmosphere surrounding sexuality to create its own brand of humor. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a group of undergraduates that produces an annual all-male cross-dressing musical in the New College Theatre, has been titillating audiences with layers of make-up, fake breasts, and high tenor solos for over 150 years. Still, this fixture within Harvard’s artistic scene does not seek to address sexuality directly. It derives its humor from a certain degree of absurdity, rather than from any hard-hitting satire of sexual norms; it takes advantage of the awkwardness surrounding issues of sexuality, rather than seeking to eradicate this discomfort.
DROPPING H-BOMB
On the other hand, the serious portrayal of sex and sexuality in an artistic setting has its own pitfalls. The 2004 debut of H-BOMB Magazine, a self-proclaimed "arts and literary magazine dedicated to exploring issues related to gender, sex, and sexuality," triggered mass media controversy. Despite the initial flurry of press attention surrounding its creation, the magazine has suffered from a lack of recognition on campus during the past few years, and its recent lack of publicity has led to financial woes. Last semester it could not find the funds necessary to print an issue.
"H-BOMB hasn’t been on the radar for a few years. We are working to counter this at the moment. We really want to create a presence here on campus, and are aiming to have enough money to at least door-drop all of the freshmen this year," says Eva M. Gillis-Buck ’11, one of the magazine’s editors. Recently, though, the future has been looking brighter for H-BOMB. "We have received a lot of support from the administration, who have proven really helpful and very pro-H-BOMB, and we get a lot of grants from [the Undergraduate Council] and from the Radcliffe trust. We get grants from gay-lesbian-trans organizations." The recent support brightens the future for H-BOMB. "People are beginning to recognize this is something that the community needs and are willing to fund that, which is wonderful," Gillis-Buck adds.
H-BOMB has seen a rejuvenation not only in its funding but in its direction. "We are trying to get the magazine back to what it first started as. [My fellow editors] and I want to return it to its roots: a little sexier, to generate more attention, and a little sluttier, sort of like a pulp magazine. We then want to direct each issue towards a different theme, so instead of each issue being similar we will have a pulpy one, a high art one, an academic one," Gillis-Buck says.
H-BOMB recognizes that there are relatively few formal outlets for students to tackle the topic of sexuality directly within a neutral arena; it aims not only to fill this gap for LGBT and straight communities. While it engages in its own breed of light humor to diffuse controversy, it tries to avoid belittling the issues surrounding sexuality. For H-BOMB, sex is something to be discussed publicly without fear of causing offense—as evinced by its name.
A SPECTRUM OF POSSIBILITIES
While it seems unlikely that any artistic movement can eradicate the controversy surrounding the LGBT community, artists like TTBaum and Grohall clearly demonstrate how important a role public art can play in social activism. This is not to say that all art addressing sexuality is progressive art; sexuality can be mocked in art just as easily as it can be respected and reconsidered. Harvard productions touching on the issues surrounding sexuality seem, at least for the time being, to sample both approaches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four top academics offered contrasting predictions on the outcome of the upcoming midterm elections at a pre-election panel sponsored by the Center for American Political Studies on Friday.
Two political scientists on the panel—titled “What Will Happen in the 2010 Elections?”—argued that November’s contests would be much closer than widely anticipated.
“This is going to be a tight election,” said Stephen D. Ansolabehere, a government professor at Harvard.
During the two hour panel discussion, Ansolabehere presented statistical data to back up his claim, arguing that the American public is more evenly divided on major policy issues than is commonly believed.
Ansolabehere also downplayed the influence of the Tea Party. “The media has made this bigger than it actually is,” he said.
Morris P. Fiorina, a professor of political science at Stanford University, echoed Ansolabehere’s doubts about the potential for a blowout victory for the Republican Party.
“I’m skeptical about notions of big losses,” he said.
However, Fiorina said he thinks the Democratic Party would suffer some losses because of missteps made during the past two years.
He pointed to the party’s “political overambition” on issues such as heath care reform.
The Obama administration’s decision to pursue health care reform was based on a presumed and mistaken “mandate” from the public, he said. “The American people don’t give mandates,” he said.
While both Fiorina and Ansolabehere said that the Democratic Party’s potential losses had been overstated, Ansolabehere said that some losses would be inevitable due to the “restoring” nature of the election.
He said that dissatisfaction with the Bush administration and enthusiasm about Barack Obama led to unexpected Democratic victories in traditionally Republican districts in 2008.
“The feeling [in 2008] was that the Democrats were going to lose 25 seats off the top [this year],” he said.
Meanwhile Professor of Government and Sociology Theda R. Skocpol said that discussion should not focus on the number of seats lost or gained by each party this year.
“What’s interesting here is not margins. Deadlock is going to deepen after this election, and that’s what matters,” she said. “There will be almost no compromises until we find out what happens in 2012.”
Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia, analyzed the socioeconomic differences that would play into the election.
Ryan D. Enos, an assistant professor of government at Harvard, attended the panel discussion and said he saw it as a way to make predictions about the election in a scientific way.
“There is a lot of folk wisdom going around about what’s going to happen,” he said. “But in panels like this...you have people looking at data who can provide more nuance than the popular narrative.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four days after police discovered what they described as graffiti that was “biased in nature” in Boylston Hall, Dean of College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an e-mail to the Harvard College community on Friday confirming that the writing contained racial slurs.
“We do not know who committed these acts on our property, but we expect and hope that the offenders were not members of our community,” Hammonds wrote in the e-mail.
The graffiti was located on both walls and desktops in the building.
“I take this incident very seriously,” Hammonds wrote. “The use of racial epithets is deeply inimical to the values and purposes of the Harvard community.”
Hammonds also wrote that the members of the College community must “all stand together against such destructive behavior.”
The acts of vandalism are currently under investigation, according to Hammonds’ message.
The first floor bathrooms of Boylston Hall were vandalized with toilet paper sometime on Oct. 2, according to the Harvard University Police Department log.
Officers were dispatched that day to respond to a fire alarm that went off in the hall and found the damage upon arrival, the log stated.
A fire extinguisher had also been discharged. The Cambridge Fire Department soon determined that the building was safe for re-entry, and afterward, Facilities Maintenance Operations was called to clean the area.
Two days later, an officer was dispatched to the building to find more vandalism—this time in the form of graffiti to the mezzanine level of the building.
HUPD spokepserson Steven G. Catalano did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Graduate School of Education Assistant Professor James S. Kim has received a $12.7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education Investing in Innovation (i3) Program to study a program that seeks to improve the reading comprehension of children from low-income families.
This grant, along with an additional $2.8 million in funding from the private sector, will be used to validate Project READS (Reading Enhances Achievement During the Summer), an initiative that encourages summer reading and provides children with books.
Kim will work with Communities in Schools, a national non-profit drop-out prevention organization, and a team of colleagues including Thomas White, senior research scientist at the University of Virginia Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, and Jonathan Guryan, associate professor at the Institute for Policy Research of Northwestern University.
Kim said he and his colleagues will evaluate and gradually scale-up the implementation of Project READS in North Carolina over the next 5 years, covering roughly 8,000 students from 65 high-poverty schools.
For the project, third to fifth graders from the selected schools will be given books that match their interests and reading level, which is determined through computer algorithms. Parents and teachers will be trained to provide support, such as reading aloud with the children and teaching good comprehension techniques. In previous experiments with Project READS in California, Kim and his team found that comprehension strategies played a key role in enhancing children’s reading ability.
“Just giving the kids books doesn’t seem to make that much of a difference,” Kim said. “It is really the teachers’ ‘scaffolding’ piece that’s contributing to comprehension above and beyond.”
According to Kim and White, the additional instruction is what distinguishes their project from others with similar purposes.
Kim and his colleagues are optimistic as to what their project could be able to achieve.
“It is a program that really appeals to practicing educators,” White said. “When we talked to teachers who have been trying to find a solution to the kids’ reading problem, they immediately sense that [Project READS] might work.”
Kim and his team hope the project will make a lasting impact.
“A lot of innovation of education dies when the organization runs out of money, or when a new superintendent comes in and wants to do something else,” Kim said. “By working with an organization like [Communities in Schools] which will be around for a long time and always be raising funds, we hope to see if the innovation can last beyond the project.”

Singer-songwriter Jean Gauthier broke out her guitar last Friday afternoon to perform for lunching faculty, grad students, and passers-by seated in the colorful assembly of chairs in front of Lehman Hall.
“I think I’ll write a song for you, then watch the gentle breeze,” sang Gauthier, whose musical style is a mix of gospel, jazz, folk, and blues.
Ordinarily, Gauthier serves as the office manager for the Harvard Center for the Environment. But last Friday she left the workplace for half an hour to perform as part of “Chairs Revue: A Festival of Performance in Harvard Yard,” an initiative that gives members of the Harvard community the chance to showcase their talents on campus.
The performance series, which began on Sept. 7 and will continue through Oct. 15, solicited people with a Harvard affiliation to act, play music, dance, juggle, or showcase another talent outside of Lehman Hall or the Science Center.
Graduate Student Christian C. Millian, who drops by the Chairs Revue performances between classes, said he never knows who the performers are in advance, “but they’ve been good, so I keep coming.”
Gauthier arrived for her act with an unassuming entourage of two, peeled off an azure sweater, set up her own equipment, and began to sing. Students looking intensely at the screens of their laptops began to glance upwards, tourists and harried undergraduates found a moment to stop and grab a free slice of the apple pie provided by Chair Revue curators, and people gradually began to orient their chairs in Gauthier’s direction.
“I love that it’s perfect for the season,” Lauren O. Libby ’14, who attended Gauthier’s performance, said of the Chairs Revue.
The series will conclude this Friday at 12:30 p.m. with performances by the Cliffe Notes, Expressions, Harvard Modern Dance Company, scenes from “Action” by Sam Shepard, and readings by A.R.T. Institute first-year students.

Harvard’s W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research announced the selection of fourteen new Institute Fellows for the fall of 2010 last Wednesday.
The Fellows, including both established and emerging scholars who hail from four different countries, will be in residence at Harvard for either the fall semester or the entire academic year to conduct individual research projects.
Their research, to be presented as part of a weekly colloquium at the Barker Center, covers a wide range of topics in the study of the African-American experience, including the movement for racial equality in the 1940s and 50s, the relationship between blacks and Asians, and African-American theatre and literature.
“The Fellows program is the jewel in the crown of the Du Bois Institute, and this fall’s fellows will be key contributors both to the field of Africa and African American Studies in general and to the Harvard community in particular,” Institute Director Henry Louis Gates, Jr. said in a statement.
Omar Wasow, a current sixth-year doctoral candidate at Harvard, described the opportunity to do research at Harvard as an “incredible gift,” citing the “deep pool” of resources and mentorships available and the rich community of scholars.
Wasow, who helped launch the social-networking site BlackPlanet.com and co-founded a K-8 charter school in Brooklyn, will focus his research on the increase in incarceration rates in the United States since 1970.
This year’s Fellows program introduces several innovations. The 2010-2011 school year will feature Theodore Miller as the first Hiphop Archive Fellow since the founding of the Du Bois Institute in 1975.
Miller, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, described hip hop as being a pivotal force in the experience of urban youth, including in his own childhood. In addition to managing the Hiphop Archive, he will conduct his own research on wealth inequality and the urban black experience.
Also for the first time, two of the Du Bois Fellows are teaching courses in the Department of African and African American studies open to both Harvard undergraduate and graduate students. Grey Gundaker, a professor at the College of William and Mary, is teaching “African Americans and the Politics of Home Ground” this fall and will teach another course in the spring. University of Maryland curator Adrienne L. Childs is teaching “Imaging Blacks and Blackness in Western Art from the Renaissance to the Twentieth Century” this fall.
The other fellows include David Bindman, Todd Carmody, Meagan Healey, Jonathan Munby, Sophie Oldfield, Ronald K. Richardson, Mark Solomon, Nirvana Tanoukhi, Lisa Thompson, and Louis Wilson.

Anand N. Bhatt ’12 and Peter R. Swiatek ’12 have a lot in common—the two met freshman year and are now blockmates in Eliot House who both keep up with NFL and college football, are both premed, and both love to work out.
The duo came up with a way to share that hobby: the Harvard Bodybuilding Club, an organization open to all members of the College community interested in fitness.
“The aim of the club is, you set whatever goal you want to reach and everyone encourages you to achieve that goal,” Swiatek said.
“Since we go to the [Malkin Athletic Center] every day, we thought we might as well form an organization,” Swiatek said. “It’d be like having a workout buddy.”
Bhatt and Swiatek received good feedback from friends and decided to forward the idea to the Office of Student Life. After filing paperwork and combing through documents to make sure similar clubs did not already exist, the proposal was granted and the Harvard Bodybuilding Club became a recognized organization.
Carl L. Miller, Eliot House tutor and faculty adviser of the club, said there is a benefit to working out in a group.
“Weight lifting is not easy; it’s tough. It’s helpful to have other people to support and encourage you,” Miller said.
As a former football player at Tuskegee University, Miller said, he has the experience to help club members learn workout techniques and make the organization a success.
“We want people to realize the joy of weight lifting and being in shape,” he said.
At an introductory meeting last Friday, the co-presidents, along with Miller and four prospective members, gathered around a round table in Eliot House to discuss the club’s purpose and their individual goals.
“I want to achieve that ideal of having a nice, fit body,” Ge Zhang ’13 said. Zhang added that he has been lifting intensely for the past three months and wants to learn more about proper techniques.
Another prospective member, Jordan R. Milan ’11, said that weight lifting has been his hobby since he was 16. Milan said he hopes the club will provide a forum to meet and talk to other people interested in fitness, training, and diet.
“It will be a good opportunity to help each other with goals and give advice,” Milan said.
Bhatt and Swiatek plan on having the members work out together two to three times a week and teaching people about proper weight lifting. They said they also hope to invite dieticians and professional body builders, as well as organize mixers and fundraisers throughout the year.
Swiatek emphasized that the club is open for all—beginning and advanced weight lifters alike.
“A lot of people are probably intimidated by the idea of joining a bodybuilding club,” Swiatek said, “but we want and welcome people of all physical shapes and lifting background.”
“Harvard Bodybuilding Club is not just about bodybuilding,” Bhatt added. “It’s also about fitness, endurance, and being toned.”

Kegs and hard liquor will be banned at the Harvard-Yale tailgate this year, in keeping with restrictions in place two years ago when The Game was last played at Harvard Stadium.
The rules, released on Friday, remain relatively unchanged from 2008.
They grant House Committees organizing tailgates a parking space and allow them to use vehicles less than 16 feet long, while barring box trucks such as U-Hauls.
The tailgate will conclude at noon, as it did in 2008.
This year’s match on Nov. 20 is the 127th in a tradition that, to many, epitomizes the long-standing rivalry between Harvard and Yale.
The Game’s location alternates between Boston and New Haven, Conn., and regulations at Harvard differ from Yale’s more relaxed tailgate guidelines. At Yale last year, kegs and U-Hauls were permitted and the tailgate continued until the third quarter of the Game.
Last year, Yale Senior Associate Athletics Director Ryan G. Bamford attributed the dissimilarities in tailgate rules to fundamental differences between the Boston area and New Haven.
This year—in a change from the policy in 2008—students will be required to wear a bracelet indicating they are of age in order to drink alcohol at the event.
Two years ago the bracelets were “highly encouraged,” according to that year’s tailgate rules.
HoCo chairs said the 2010 guidelines did not take them by surprise.
“They’re pretty much the same as they were two years ago,” said Ryan K. Schell ’11, co-chair of the Pforzheimer HoCo. “It’s sort of restrictive, but we should be able to have a good time either way.”
HoCo chairs were able to review the guidelines before they were released, several chairs said.
Some HoCo chairs criticized the ban on kegs.
Sami Majadla ’11, one of the Currier HoCo co-chairs, said that it would “be a waste of money to buy beer balls or cases” of beer, and Eliot HoCo Co-Chair Bryan W. Dunmire ’11 said that the ban could have environmental repercussions.
“It’s hard that we’re not allowed to bring kegs, only because kegs take down the trash,” Dunmire said. “Now, there’s going to be a ton of trash everywhere, so that’s troublesome.”
The first Harvard-Yale tailgate that faced a ban on kegs was in 2002. Announcing the decision in 2000, then-Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote in an e-mail that there were “a couple of incidents in which students could easily have died.”
Since then, restrictions have varied. In 2004, the administration centralized alcohol distribution and instituted ID checks after several alcohol-related hospitalizations, including a near-death, in 2002.
In 2006, following criticism by the Boston Police Department, students were prohibited from bringing alcohol into the tailgate. But in 2008, HoCos were permitted to serve beer and wine, though the tailgate had to end at noon.
Despite the restrictions, Adams HoCo Co-Chair Elyse M. Traverse ’12 said that due to the variety of social opportunities at the Game, she said she expected that people will have a good time.
“It’s going to be great regardless,” she said.

In response to student concern about a recent grading policy change that assigned points to the pass-fail system, the Harvard Law School administration has decided to remove point values from transcripts, according to the Law School’s student government.
The decision—the latest in a series of tweaks to the grading policy since this summer—was met with approval from student government representatives who praised the Law School administration’s receptiveness to issues raised over the past few weeks.
“This is a school where people are taking students’ concerns seriously,” said Harvard Law School Student Government President Jennifer D. Dein.
Student government representatives sent Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow a letter two weeks ago stating that the grading policy change would allow employers to calculate GPAs in evaluating job candidates, making the application process more competitive.
Under that policy, four points are awarded for a High Pass, three for Pass, two for Low Pass, and zero for a failing grade.
The change—intended to make Latin Honors calculations more precise—was not publicly announced, and the Law School administration implemented the policy over the summer, including the revisions in the 2010-2011 Student Handbook.
“If the numbers are primarily for the school to determine Latin Honors, there does not seem to be a reason for the employers to have the information at their fingertips,” the student government wrote to Minow.
Last week, the administration decided to revise the policy to remove the calculated average from the transcript, but add an explanatory paragraph about point values on the back.
Any reference to point values has now been removed from the transcript, and the administration will only use the point system to calculate Latin Honors, Minow announced to the student government on Friday, according to Dein.
“I don’t think it was a really easy decision,” Dein said.
According to Jessica L. Tiller, a second-year law student and student government director of academic affairs, Minow does not plan to announce the change, allowing the student government to decide how to communicate the adjustment.
Tiller said an announcement has been posted on the student government website and as of Saturday representatives were deciding whether to e-mail the student body.
Though students have expressed concerns about the administration’s lack of communication, Tiller said she thought an announcement from the administration may “blow [the issue] out of proportion and make it a bigger deal.”
“The student handbook is publicly available and it is our responsibility to know what is in it,” Tiller said, adding that she was pleased that Minow “took what we said to heart and thought they were valid concerns.”
“We got a better sense that it was not a haphazard decision,” Dein said.

Professor of Cosmology John P. Huchra died Friday. He was 61.
The cause of death had not been publicly released as of last night.
An expert in the large-scale structure of the universe and observational cosmology, Huchra and a number of colleagues started a Redshift Survey, the first attempt to map large-scale structures of the universe.
In 1989, Huchra discovered one of the largest known structures in the universe—a sheet of galaxies over 500 million light-years long and 200 million light-years wide dubbed the Great Wall—with colleague Margaret J. Geller, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
In the last decade, Huchra and Geller measured the relative distance of approximately 18,000 bright galaxies in the northern sky.
“He was an extraordinary scientist,” said Director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Charles R. Alcock, a colleague of Huchra’s who first met Huchra as a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology in 1973.
Huchra was willing to “spend an extraordinary amount of time at the telescope,” said Alcock, citing an instance when Huchra worked 130 days with the telescope in a year.
At Harvard, Huchra served as the Senior Advisor to the Provost for Research Policy and was involved in the Center for Astrophysics, according to his homepage on Center’s website.
Huchra was teaching Freshman Seminar 21x: Galaxies and the Universe this fall and was scheduled to lead Astronomy 98: Research Tutorial in Astrophysics in the spring.
Huchra was “absolutely fantastic at nurturing people one on one,” said James M. Moran, professor of astrophysics and chair of the astronomy department.
“Any time a student was uncertain of his future, he was always there,” Moran said. “He was really an incredibly caring person.”
In addition to astronomy, Huchra was also concerned about instilling high ethical standards in his students, according to Moran.
Outside of his work, Huchra was an avid traveler.
He would go on all kinds of “exotic trips” to “obscure places,” Moran said, and as a result of Huchra’s extensive travelling, “he had friends everywhere.”
The Story Chapel at Mount Auburn Cemetery will hold funeral service for Huchra today at 11 a.m.
Huchra is survived by his wife Rebecca M. Henderson, son Harry, sister Christine, and parents Mieccyslaw and Helen.

A century after Mass. first recognized Columbus Day as a legal holiday, about 30 students gathered outside of Matthews Hall last night for a candlelight vigil honoring “Dia de La Resistencia Indigena” (Day of Indigenous Resistance), a part of broader efforts calling for the re-thinking of Columbus Day and the historical origins of the United States.
Held near the former site of Harvard’s Indian College, the vigil offered Native American and non-Native American students alike the opportunity to reflect on their roots and the colonial history of the Americas, said Tiffany L. Smalley ’11, president of Native Americans at Harvard College, which sponsored the event.
By celebrating Dia de La Resistencia Indigena—a Venezuelan holiday that honors indigenous peoples and commemorates their struggles against colonization—the club sought to raise awareness of these issues, also displaying large red posters around campus that highlighted campaigns by historical figures against Native Americans.
“A lot of people aren’t realizing what Columbus has left behind in his legacy,” said Smalley, a member of the Wampanoag tribe. “To us, Columbus Day is the celebration of the figure whose arrival marks the beginning of a 500-year period of genocide, racism, and quite frankly, terrorism, on this land.”
This candlelight vigil comes after a themed party held by Sigma Chi on Friday night drew criticism from many  members of Native Americans at Harvard College. A member of the Sigma Chi leadership told The Crimson that the event was called “Brave New World,” but the theme has been characterized by other students as “Conquistabros and Navajos.”
“It’s always very disappointing to see native cultures lumped into one group that you can dress up,” said Tia M. Ray ’12, vice president of Native Americans at Harvard College and a member of the Navajo tribe, explaining how she felt that the event made a “mockery” out of her tribe.
A member of Sigma Chi said that the event was not intended to offend anyone, and the controversy has prompted discussion within the organization on planning future events.
Despite the solemnity of the vigil, many members of Native Americans at Harvard College said they were excited for the future since the College had made major improvements in recognizing the history of Native Americans, citing as examples the anthropology course “Archaeology of Harvard Yard” and the construction of a traditional Wampanoag dwelling last spring in honor of the 360th anniversary of the Harvard Charter of 1650, which dedicated the College “to the education of English & Indian youth of this Country in knowledge.”
During a period of reflection, Lange P. Luntao ’12—who is not Native American—said he viewed the event as an opportunity for “sharing a different side of American heritage that needs to be recognized more readily in society.”
The club plans to propose that the College administration rescind the University’s recognition of the holiday and replace it with a celebration of indigenous people or a Fall Break, as Brown University did in 2009.
“Clearly it’s about educating people about Columbus and colonization in a productive way,” Ray said.
“We want to turn this into a positive day,” Smalley said. “We don’t want this to be something we are continuously sad about.”

Tiny rainbow flags lined the paths leading to the Science Center yesterday afternoon for the Harvard Queer Students and Allies observance of National Coming Out Day, a day intended to promote awareness of LGBT rights issues.
The twenty-second annual observance of National Coming Out Day yesterday came with the added weight of recent tragedies affecting LGBT citizens nationwide. The last month alone has seen at least eleven suicides by youth who were harassed because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as several hate crimes against LGBT individuals, including one at Harvard.
“National Coming Out Day has additional meaning this year because of what’s happening around the country,” said QSA Political Co-Chair Ben Biran ’13, who kneeled on the grass coloring in a sign stating “God Bless the Gays” as he spoke.
“We already enjoy privileges and rights that past generations couldn’t dream of, and we have to acknowledge the people who have sacrificed so much for us to be where we are now,” he said, pausing from his coloring. “Still, we’re not quite there yet. It’s very important that we create a safe environment and reach out to people who feel different to make them feel like they have family, and to show them that it’s okay to be gay.”
QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 emphasized that although it is important to get the message of acceptance across, coming out is not always an option for everyone.
“If you want to be out, there’s a whole community that is out, happy, and proud, but we’re here to support members of the community wherever they are in their coming out process,” he said, adding that the most important point was that people should be able to express their identities in the way that makes them the most comfortable.
“National Coming Out Day is about remembering the harm of being in the closet, but it’s also about recognizing that we all have the agency to make it different,” Chan said.
Political co-chair Lucy C. O’Leary ’12 added that claiming agency is especially significant in a time marked by acts of violence, as the last few weeks have been.
“All the recent suicides are incredibly tragic, but they’ve brought a lot of attention to the cause,” said O’Leary, whose hands were busy making origami cranes, which she explained as a traditional symbol of peace and remembrance of death.
“I feel like we’re at the crux of something big, and it’s an important time to speak out,” she added, explaining that in light of the recent events, members of the QSA have organized a group to advocate for the consolidation of resources for the queer community on campus. This group will work in conjunction with the students involved in an LGBT working group announced by Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds last week.
In addition to this political direction, said O’Leary, QSA is endeavoring to rally support from the larger community by planning acts that will be visible on campus, starting with a “Speak Out” rally to raise awareness about violence against LGBT youth and a candlelight vigil to remember the most recent victims of violence, both to be held today.
As the QSA students worked on coloring their signs and folding cranes, tourists passing by stopped to stare.
“This isn’t what I expected to see visiting Harvard,” said one who had stopped to ask for directions. “It’s good to see someone is taking a stand.”

Comedy for a Cause—an annual production sponsored by the Harvard College Concert Commission—raised laughs as well as funding for the Phillips Brooks House Association in Sanders Theatre on Saturday night.
This year’s show featured comedians Jessica Kirson, Arnie Ellis, Alex Barnett, and Harrison R. Greenbaum ’08, who entertained an audience with their pro bono performances.
In past years, the show has raised money for organizations such as the Earthquake Relief Coalition and Room to Read, which provides educational opportunities to girls in the developing world. This year, however, the Concert Commission wanted to keep the cause “close to home,” according to director Synne D. Chapman '11, and so decided to give all the proceeds of the event to PBHA.
Greenbaum said that he greatly enjoyed performing for the Harvard audience, describing them as extremely positive and enthusiastic.
“As a comedian, you can tell in the first few seconds,” Greenbaum said, later adding “you couldn’t ask for a better, nicer audience.”
As a graduate of the College, Greenbaum said he was excited to be performing on the same stage upon which he watched professors lecture.
“It was like coming back home,” he said.
Greenbaum said he also appreciated the service aspect of his performance and said he enjoys the opportunity to give back whenever he can with his performances. In the past, Greenbaum has participated in and held shows for causes such as Comedy Cures, and he plans to participate in an upcoming event called Wounded Warriors Project.
Chapman, who is also a Crimson magazine editor, said that overall she was pleased with the event and the audience’s response. The comedians were “a pleasure to work with—nothing but polite and hilarious,” she said.
While Chapman said she was disappointed with the attendance, which was lower than last year’s, she attributed the drop to the three day weekend and said she was pleased with the reactions of those who attended.
Comedy for a Cause is one of two major events held by the Concert Commission every year. The second event, Yardfest, takes place in the spring and has featured artists including Wu-Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, and Kid Cudi in past years.

Although Munich ended its 17-day Oktoberfest on Oct. 4, the celebration carried on in Harvard Square on Sunday, as hundreds of vendors, several live bands, a parade, and three pseudo-beer gardens took over the Square.
Rachael Solem, a member of the Harvard Square Business Association’s board of directors, estimated that over 100,000 people gathered to enjoy the Square’s 32nd annual Oktoberfest.
Solem said the festival has grown in attendance and scope due to its recent “embellishment,” including the HONK! Festival Parade, a grassroots, non-profit event composed of over 350 eccentric musicians.
Leslie A. Wacker, a self-described “rogue marching band tramp,” is one of three members of the band that has attended every HONK! Festival Parade—also known as a HONK! Fest—ever held, including five in the Boston area and three in Seattle. Wacker, dressed in purple fishnets, layered dresses, a corset, and a clown nose, called the members of the band her “family.”
Over 30 Honk! Bands from the Davis Square area congregated in Harvard Square to parade for Oktoberfest, banging drums and honking horns in a scene that could easily have been found within the pages of a Dr. Seuss book.
The offbeat performers and myriad vendors did not compose an authentic Oktoberfest, though they did deliver a uniquely-Cambridge version of the event.
American beers proliferated, and temporary “beer gardens,” such as the one set up by Mongolian barbecue restaurant Fire + Ice in the Church St. parking lot, seemed far from a typical German Oktoberfest experience.
Dressed in traditional lederhosen passed down from his great-grandfather, Ian M. Stone, a student at Bridgewater State College in Bridgewater, Mass. who has been to an Oktoberfest celebration in Germany, said, “We were expecting something with real German food and more of the tradition of dancing, music, and cooking. I’d call [the Harvard Square Oktoberfest] Halloween. People are dressed up pretty weird.”
Cambridge’s take on the 200-year-old celebration was filled with characters. Moses Grubb, a San Francisco resident visiting the East Coast as a member of a touring kinetic sculpture based on the game Mouse Trap, noted that the Harvard Square Oktoberfest marked his first visit to the state, and that the spectacular weather and talent of the HONK! Fest performers made the trip worthwhile.
Harvard students seemed to enjoy the quirky composite of visitors as much as the event itself.
“It’s a nice event to have,” said Bekah G. Ross ’11. “It’s fun to walk around and look enviously at carnival food stands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday night, nearly every Harvard undergraduate received an invitation under his or her door.
But rather than arriving in an envelope emblazoned with the seal of one of Harvard’s final clubs, the paper flier invited each student to join them in “NOT joining a Final Club” and “NOT attending Final Club parties.”
The invitation was an advertisement for a meeting Friday to discuss the role of final clubs on campus.
Coordinated by a group of seven undergraduates who say they aim to make Harvard’s social scene safer and more inclusive, the unnamed anti-final club campaign wants administrators to do more to revitalize student life outside the clubs.
The coordinators also said they hope to move students to action, asking them not to join final clubs or attend their parties.
Additionally, the group plans to solicit stories from those who have had experiences with final clubs, as well as from those who shy away from them.
“We want to give voice to those people on that side of things, making sure that people who are against final clubs or choose not to go to final clubs don’t feel isolated or alone,” said Tara D. Venkatraman ’11, one of the initiative’s coordinators.
The groups’ opposition to final clubs is rooted in what they called the exclusive and unsafe nature of clubs that, they said, lack transparency.
The punch process, the parties, and the gender limits all contribute to the clubs’ exclusive nature, said Sabrina G. Lee ’12, another organizer.
“The frats, anyone can rush. The Seneca, anyone can apply to. Final clubs, you have to be punched to join,” co-organizer Camille S. Owens ’13 said.
Delphic Club member Alexander E. Chi ’11 said that the parties restrict their guest lists because of the limited space available inside the clubs.
But a final club leader, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said in an e-mail that there should be a “change in the social scene.”
“I do not believe that final clubs should be one of the only social spaces for undergraduates, and the University should begin to look more into having more accessible and supervised parties,” the leader wrote.
Although the final club campaign encourages students not to attend final club parties, coordinators said they do not seek to prevent partying—rather, they aim to create more inclusive options for student socializing.
“A criticism we’ve all already received from handing out that flier is we’re anti-fun and hate parties,” Owens said.
“We want to have more parties,” Seth A. Pearce ’12 said, continuing Owens’ thought. “We want to have more room parties that everyone can go to.”
But in order to expand the available social space on campus, the group is looking for help from College administrators.
Members of the initiative said they hope to cooperate with the College administration to accomplish concrete goals: expanding access to House space like Junior and Senior Common Rooms for parties, increasing funding for student groups to rent off-campus social space like the Democracy Center, and providing more information about final clubs to freshmen and sophomores during orientations.
The idea for the initiative emerged over a year ago from a conversation between Venkatraman, Pearce, and Lee. Most of the group’s seven coordinators already knew each other from high school, House life, or the Freshman Urban Program.
The group’s organizers say they know that in the past, anti-final-club campaigns have formed and fizzled, but they say their specific goals and open advertising will help them achieve their ends.
“We don’t really see ourselves being a student group that each term has a discussion about this and moves in a circle,” Owens said. “We don’t want to see this around forever. We want to see our goals accomplished.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Science received nearly 12,000 applications during the 2009-2010 admissions cycle, the largest number in GSAS history, the school announced last Thursday.
GSAS also reported the highest collective yield rate since the 1950s, with the humanities and social sciences averaging a record 75 percent yield. The natural sciences, including the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, saw an unprecedented yield of 60 percent.
The new class is composed of a record number of students who have won the National Science Foundation award and other prestigious external fellowships. Last year, the University accepted 21 students who had received NSF awards, compared to this year’s 48. GSAS currently has 138 new and continuing students with NSF awards, doubling last year’s total.
“These remarkable numbers really speak to the strength and character of our graduate programs,” GSAS Dean Allan M. Brandt wrote in a statement to the Crimson. “They reflect our ability to attract the best students, and they highlight the care that our departments are taking as they build their programs. To meet—and even exceed—admissions targets in a highly competitive academic environment requires excellent recruitment processes that fully engage admitted students. Clearly, our departments are hitting the mark when it comes to recruiting the students they’ve chosen to admit.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mail that the increased numbers can be attributed not only to a lack of available jobs but also to the caliber of Harvard’s graduate programs.
“The difficult job market is driving up application numbers across higher education,” Neal wrote. “But we also experienced an extraordinarily high yield, which means that students who were accepted not only wanted to attend graduate school, they wanted to attend Harvard’s graduate school. As Dean Brandt indicated, this is a sign of the overall strength of our graduate programs, as recently reaffirmed by the National Research Council.”
Evaluations released on Sept. 28 by the National Research Council ranked 27 of the 52 Harvard graduate programs first in the nation in at least one of the categories assessed. Ninety percent of the University’s programs placed fifth or higher in at least one of the two ranking systems, which evaluated approximately 5000 programs at 212 institutions.
Neal attributed GSAS’s high yield rate to the intense effort the departments put into attracting potential students. “The typical yield for graduate programs is between 50 and 55 percent,” Neal wrote. “So, to have yields in the humanities and social sciences of more than 75 percent is remarkable. And to yield 60 percent in the natural sciences—the most competitive area—is dramatically successful too. This is where credit is due to the departments, and to efforts to recruit/support the best students in their decision to come here.”

Have late night munchies but brain break has been ravished and you are sick of Noch’s pizza? Thankfully, Harvard has four student-run grilles that are open on late nights for your masticating pleasure. Flyby has the run down of these grilles so that your munchies never go unfulfilled again. The best part—all these grilles take Board Plus!Quincy Grille
Hours: Sunday – Wednesday 10 p.m. – 2 a.m. Thursday 10 p.m. – 3 a.m. Friday – Saturday: 10 p.m. – 4 a.m.
The Quincy Grille is perhaps the most popular of the Grilles on campus, mainly due to its central location. At peak times on Friday and Saturday nights, easily 20 people could hover around the counter for food. The most popular item on the menu are the mozzarella sticks. The menu also includes sweet potato fries, smoothies, and their infamous Ronnie burger, a monstrous cheeseburger with all the fixings. A noticeable absence from the menu this year is the grille’s milkshakes. According to an employee, the new management this year decided that there is not enough demand for milkshakes. However, customers are encouraged to email quincygrille@gmail.com and request them to be brought back.
Eliot Grille
Hours: Thursday – Sunday 10 p.m. – 2 a.m.
The Eliot Grille is currently closed until a permit is renewed in two weeks, according to grille manager Victoria L. Migdal ’12. The Eliot Grille is located in “The Inferno” which is in the basement of J entryway, the first entryway as you walk into Eliot. While the menu includes classic grille food, such as fries and burgers, they are most proud of their milkshakes and frappes. While hours are limited, individuals may request management to “cater” events held in the Inferno with enough notice.
Quad Grille
Hours: weekdays 10:30 p.m. – 1:30 a.m. weekends 10:30 p.m. – 2:30 a.m.
The Quad Grille—formerly Pfoho Grille—officially opened last week for the 90’s dance. The name change is intentional. “For all intents and purposes, we are now the Quad Grille. We’ll be doing a lot of outreach to the other Quad houses,” said grille manager Maya E. Shwayder ’11 in an e-mail. “We want it to be a service that the whole Quad can enjoy.” Popular items on the menu include mozzarella sticks, curly fries, and chicken snack wraps, which are said to be worth the trip. Milkshakes remain available, so Quadlings won’t be without their evening sugar fix. The Quad Grille is also offering a punch card promotion, in which frequent grille customers can get free food after certain number of visits. Management plans to offer different promotions throughout the year. Note to job-seeking Flyby readers: the grille is currently still hiring, contact grille management if interested.
Dunster Grille
Hours: weekdays 10 p.m. – 1 a.m. weekends 12 a.m. – 2 a.m.
According to a grille employee, the Dunster Grille is currently closed and awaiting a health inspection. However, once it opens, the Dunster Grille is a solid place to grab a bite and hang out. The area surrounding the grille includes ping-pong and billiard tables, as well as a TV. The menu includes the normal grille options, with a specialty named “Fat Spencer” sandwich. This monstrosity includes a hamburger, mozzarella sticks, fries, and chili all on a long bun. Also, rumor goes that Al Gore ‘69 spent most of his time in the Dunster Grille while at Harvard.
There are plenty of options to choose from to satisfy late night cravings, no matter where you live on campus.

The latest episode of On Harvard Time involved many Four Lokos, a crime-reducing operation at Tufts and a shocking revelation about final clubs.
Loathing the fact that Harvard was ranked third on the 2010 Daily Beast’s list of the 50 most dangerous American college campuses, OHT hosts suggested the only way to make Harvard number one was to bump Tufts University from the first place by reducing its crime rate. Freshman Zachary W. Guzman ’14 visited Tufts to clean the sidewalks and ensure relationships are consensual.
Between two sips of Four Loko, the hosts also presented a few pages from the Lowell swimsuit calendar scheduled for release at the end of the term. If you are not easily offended, don’t miss OHT’s mock pictures of other campus organizations. The Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra’s fake calendar shots were…interesting, to say the least.
At the end of the episode, screenwriter for “The Social Network” Aaron Sorkin sat down with OHT and spoke his mind about the Phoenix. Sorkin got the chance to tour the club while working on the movie. However, Sorkin wasn’t quite as impressed. “Sorry if I am insulting anyone at Harvard,” Sorkin said in the OHT episode, “but it looked to me like any fraternity house I have ever been at any college.” Ouch, we wonder what the Phoenix members will think of this.

While beer may never be replaced as the quintessential party beverage, it now has some serious competition. A combination of caffeine, taurine, guarana, and alcohol, Four Loko has been sweeping through college campuses across the country. The malt drink is the brainchild of three college friends who decided to capitalize on the rising popularity of mixing energy drinks and alcohol, according to manufacturer Phusion Projects’ website.
The website claims Four Loko contains less caffeine than a common tall drip coffee. However, it also contains taurine and guarana, two components commonly found in energy drinks. In conjunction with a 12.0% alcohol content (or 6.0%, depending on the state), the Four Loko packs a swift and potentially dangerous punch. Not surprisingly, Phusion Projects is facing scrutiny from several state attorney generals for misleading marketing.  Not to mention, the nutrition information is noticeably missing from both the can and the website…
Four Loko is sold in nine different flavors, including Grape, Fruit Punch, Orange Blend, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry, Lemonade, Cranberry, Cranberry Lemonade and Lemon Lime. The flamboyantly-colored 23.5 fl oz. cans are impossible to miss. You can find Four Loko at C’est Bon, which carries Blue Raspberry, Grape, and Orange Blend for a pre-tax price of $3.85.
This post does not in any way intend to promote or condone underage drinking. Should you choose to drink, please drink responsibly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 1 the men’s swimming and diving team took its first official plunge into Blodgett Pool. At midnight. With only a month until the squad’s first tri-meet at Dartmouth, senior Blake Lewkowitz and the rest of the squad are getting ready to race. Here The Hebrew Hammer gives a look into the unusual moments of Harvard swimming, from burning pools to locker room shenanigans. And that myth about peeing turning purple in a pool? It’s true. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference. 
Name: Blake Lewkowitz
Year: 2011
Stats: The senior from Phoenix, Ariz., was one of only three Harvard men’s swimmers to qualify for NCAA nationals last year after placing second in the 1650 free at the Ivy League Championships. Over the summer Lewkowitz placed in the top 10 of the 5k Open Water Championships, two minutes behind the first place time.
Ready, set…
1. Typical pre-game meal.
Our meets are usually away. We have two home meets this year and host the Ivy Championships, and that's a lot. So, we usually have our pregame meal on the road. Dunkin' Donuts assorted donuts are a must for our team, and we single-handedly keep the Dunkin' Donuts shops in Cambridge running. While we do get some good meals on the road (as our coach described once, "We had a nice little pitstop at Fuddruckers"), I'd have to say that donuts are a Harvard men's swimming and diving staple.
2. Songs you listen to before races to get pumped up.
We usually aren't allowed to have iPods on deck with us during meets, so the last couple songs I listen to before games would have to be "Harvard on the Warpath" (our team cheer) and the National Anthem. Nothing like a classic to get you going.
3. Favorite team to swim against and why.
My favorite team to swim against, hands down, is Princeton. They are our biggest rivals, and we get two chances to take them down. Our annual meet against Yale and Princeton, known as H-Y-P, is the first meet against them and Ivy Championships is the second. H-Y-P is the best meet of the year. There are some fans in the stands, a lot of alumni support, and tons of really fast swimming. It happens in late January, roughly a month before Ivy Championships, and it provides a final test before the big meet. The atmosphere is electric—every swim comes down to the wire and is extremely exciting. The winner gets a bucket (I couldn't make that up if I tried) that has been passed down since the '60s, so it's a historic meet for everyone involved. It always comes down to us and Princeton, and the battle is intense.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team’s locker room.
The most ridiculous thing that took place in our locker room had to be when one of our teammates was demonstrating his favorite sexual position in detail. It started off as a joke but quickly turned into a huge ordeal with props—you get the picture. Of course, our coach walks in and stared in confusion for a few seconds only to storm off. Our teammate was so embarrassed, but the whole event provided laughs and funny comments from our coach for the rest of the season.
5. Most embarrassing moment you’ve had swimming.
There's a chemical in some pools that warns lifeguards and pool managers when someone is peeing in the pool because the chemical reacts with the pee and turns the water purple. I never knew about this until about the age of 16 when I was in a competition. At certain meets, there is a thing called a ready-room. Athletes in the final session of the race have to report to the ready-room at least 15 minutes in advance to the race. I warmed up, got ready, and went to the room. Once I got there, I realized I really had to pee, but I wasn't allowed to leave the room. Long story short, during the race, I started peeing, only to be informed after the race that I left a nice purple trail up and down the pool.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I swim distance freestyle, so the animal that would best represent me would have to be a kangaroo. Fun fact: they can go 100 miles at the same speed. Sounds boring, but I'd have to say that it pretty well describes what I have to do day in and day out.
7. The most ridiculous thing you’ve ever heard a fan yell at a meet.
The most ridiculous thing I heard a fan yell at a swim meet was, no joke, "Stop the meet—the pool is on fire!" A propane heater lit on fire and a coach threw it into the pool. Unfortunately, the pool was covered so it burst into flames. I never thought I would hear that at a meet, but it provided some entertainment to the fans in the stand.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
If I could play another sport at Harvard it would definitely be golf. I play a lot of golf when I'm home and wish I could do it full-time. I joke about making a lot of money right out of college and then retiring early to try to qualify for the Champions Tour.
9. Position you’d play in Quidditch.
I would be the seeker. There's not really any glamour in being a distance swimmer. I would be willing to bet that the mile is one of the few events in the Olympics where a commercial break doesn't come close to taking up the entire race. The seeker is the most important position on the team and one who gets the most attention. It would be a nice change.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Beatriz and Branca Feres. I doubt anyone has heard of them, but they are identical twins and Brazilian Olympians for synchronized swimming. I don't think you can really beat that. I'd obviously take them to Mather, but if I had to get creative, I'd go Patagonia. They are from South America, so I think they would appreciate it. It's absolutely beautiful and picturesque (like them). Plus, it's freezing there so we'd have to stay very close together to keep warm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a coin for a valuable colt toss favors a fellow horsebreeder and leaves Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) with the less-desirable Secretariat, Chenery happily says, "I got what I wanted." Her smug opponent spits back, "You got what nobody else wanted." And so the wonderfully clichéd "Secretariat" begins by establishing two underdogs set to exceed expectations: the unwanted colt and the stereotypically docile housewife.
Penny begins the movie as Mrs. Tweedy—a mother of four, a caring daughter, and a loving wife. As she slowly spends more time at her father’s ranch and less time at home after the death of her mother and hospitalization of her father, Penny reassumes her surname, Ms. Chenery. When a hand on her family’s farm challenges her, she boldly states that, "every bit of this is my business, do you understand?" And as Secretariat grows over the course of the film, he aids Ms. Chenery in becoming an even stronger woman. When the horse poses in the winners’ circle, Ms. Chenery says, "He only does what he wants to do exactly when he wants to do it"— over the course of the film, she comes to embody that same sense of independence. Though based on a true story, the seemingly magical relationship between Ms. Chenery and Secretariat seems a bit too perfect to be believed. But staying true to Disney form, the film is still surprisingly mesmerizing in spite of its adherence to strict conventions.
The actors in the movie all do an excellent job fully immersing themselves in their somewhat limited roles. Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich), is Secretariat’s quirky trainer, a man strange enough to be taken seriously yet genuine enough to be endearing. His few pathetically attempted jokes are forgiven when his determination helps Secretariat win the Triple Crown. Other supporting actors, including Margo Martindale and Nelsan Ellis, are likewise great in their smaller roles— in fact, Lane’s acting is frequently overshadowed by that of her co-actors.
Lane is more convincing in the happy scenes than the sad. When she is supposedly depressed or sad, Lane utilizes only one facial expression— as such, she seems equally bothered by her mother’s death, the abscess in Secretariat’s mouth, and his losing a race. The cheesy gospel music ("Oh Happy Days") and inappropriately placed flashback sequences only highlight the mediocre acting in these scenes.
The best scenes in "Secretariat" are undoubtedly the race scenes. There is just something about the stature of horses, the heat of the stadium, the intensity of the competition, and the suspense of the races that elicits emotions of anticipation and happiness. The ridiculousness of the Belmont Stakes is beautifully portrayed, complete with camera angles showing the mud flying, the sweat on Ronnie Turcotte’s (Secretariat’s jockey, played by Otto Thorwarth) face, and Secretariat’s flaring nostrils.
When an onlooker asks Penny if "you’re that stubborn," she responds: "I’m just that right." Stubbornness prevails throughout the film. The social norms of the 1970s forbid Ms. Chenery to be so strong, but she’s a feisty one: "It hasn’t been done, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work." When failing at asking for bids on Secretariat’s win, she said, "I don’t care how many times they say no—I want it." Ronnie was told not to push Secretariat that hard right out of the gate at Belmont, but both his determination Secretariat’s stubbornness to run the whole length won out. Such a message, while simplistic, is nonetheless somewhat inspiring.
Ms. Chenery’s attachment to Secretariat starts when her father whispers for her to "let him run his race." As the movie progresses, each character is given an opportunity to run his or her own race. Right before Secretariat runs at Belmont, Ms. Chenery whispers to her horse, "I realized something…I’ve already won, I’ve run my race. Now you run yours." And despite the fact that his path was already well-worn by, countless other inspirational underdog sports films, Secretariat’s race remains a thrilling spectacle of achievement.
