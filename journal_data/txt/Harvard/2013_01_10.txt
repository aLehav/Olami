After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quincy House tutor Ece G. Turnator will serve as Quincy’s acting resident dean this spring in place of Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman, who will take a semester-long sabbatical from her post.
Chapman announced her plans in an email to the Quincy community on Tuesday.
Chapman, a lecturer on Human Evolutionary Biology, said in an interview that she decided to take a sabbatical to focus on teaching. She will continue to live in Quincy during the spring semester and will be available to advise students, though Turnator will handle her administrative duties.
“I’ll still be part of the community and be very present,” Chapman said.
Chapman said she plans to resume her post as resident dean at the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year.
Turnator, a graduate student in the history department, has served previously as the acting resident dean of Dudley House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s soccer coach Carl Junot announced his resignation Tuesday after three seasons at the helm of the team, including the most recent 2012 season that saw men’s soccer go 3-11-3 and finish last in the Ivy League with a 0-6-1 conference record.
The Athletic Department said in a Thursday press release announcing the news that it had already begun a national search for Junot’s replacement.
In an email sent to his team earlier this week, Junot wrote that although he planned to step down his assistant coaches would remain with the team for the rest of the year.
“It was obviously a surprise to hear over break,” said men’s soccer player Joseph C. Kearney ’14. “Everyone was preparing for spring season.”
Director of Athletic Communications Kurt K. Svoboda said in a phone interview Thursday that he was “a little surprised” by Junot’s resignation.
“He was here just this weekend. I didn’t talk to him, but everything seemed on the up and up,” Svoboda said. “I was just notified of this.”
Before assuming the head role, Junot served as an assistant coach for the Crimson from 2008-2010. Junot finishes with a record of 10-30-11 as head coach.
In a statement, Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise praised Junot’s contributions to the program.
“Carl leaves a strong legacy of community service through our spring game [versus] Haiti, and an unquestioned commitment to the student-athlete experience,” Scalise said. “We wish him well in his future endeavors.”
Obiajulu C. Agha Jr. '14, a men’s soccer player, said that after the team’s struggles he has mixed feelings about the coach’s resignation.
“We haven’t had the best last three seasons," Agha said. "I like Junot as a person—he’s done his best to help me with things outside of soccer—so I’ll miss him as a friend and as coach, but I do think it’s time to take things in a new direction."
But Connor P. McCarthy ’14, also a member of the team, said that Junot has helped set the stage for future success from men’s soccer.
“We’ve definitely made a lot of strides as a team under Carl,” McCarthy said. “We’re all disappointed to see him go, but we can move forward and build upon the foundation he has set.”
The department and Scalise could not be reached for further comment, and Junot declined to comment on this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2012 might have been the most memorable year in modern Harvard sports history. Most of the memories have been positive, but there have been a few bad ones as well. A lot of these memories have come in the form of defeats at the hands of the Tigers from Princeton.
During the 2012 fall sports season, Crimson teams have fallen to the Tigers on the field, on the ice, and on the court. Whether it’s a 7-0 blowout in field hockey, or a miraculous comeback in the final frame of a football game, Princeton has somehow found a way to edge out Harvard in almost every contest this fall.
Oct. 20th marked the dawn of the Harvard-Princeton feud this school year. In a single night, football, men’s soccer, women’s soccer, and field hockey all fell to the Tigers, perhaps initiating a string of bad juju for Harvard in Princeton contests this season.
Arguably the most gut wrenching loss occurred at Princeton Stadium. The Crimson football team had been thus far undefeated and was a favorite to win the Ivy League. The Harvard defeat was unanticipated, especially after the Crimson headed into halftime with a 20-0 lead. In the second frame, the Tigers answered two Harvard touchdowns with a total of 29 points of their own, with Princeton backup quarterback Quinn Epperly throwing a 36-yard touchdown with 13 ticks left on the clock. The final score read 39-34. The Tigers curse, which has plagued the Crimson since Doug Davis hit that buzzer beater two years ago, was here to stay.
Both Crimson soccer teams had tough bouts against Princeton, with the women falling 3-1 and the men suffering a 2-1 loss in double-overtime. The men’s match saw two late goals after a stalemate in the first 83 minutes, with Harvard and the Tigers heading into overtime, 1-1. The final goal came from Princeton forward Alex Wetermann and forced yet another loss for the Crimson on Oct. 20th.
So far the New Year has not been promising for the Crimson either, with the men’s ice hockey team falling to the Tigers 3-2 in overtime on Jan. 4th. The women’s team will face off against Princeton this Friday at 7pm. With its only loss occurring back in November against BU, No. 4 Harvard looks to finally declaw the dreaded Tigers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of the break—without having been at the Murr Center since early December—Harvard's favored men’s squash team could have underestimated its opponent.
But the No. 3 Crimson (7-0, 1-0 Ivy) did just the opposite, coming in with a competitive mentality that helped the team shut out No. 15 Bates (6-2, 1-0 NESCAC) in its third consecutive 9-0 finish and its sixth of the season.
“I thought it was a job well done by the team,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “It was all down to business. Everyone was focused, even if they were better than their opponent.”
The Harvard team, which arrived back on campus this week, quickly got back into playing form as the matches began, picking up seven 3-0 victories en route to a perfect finish.
Atop the Crimson, reigning national champion Ali Farag ousted his opponent in four games, dropping only one frame to the Bobcats’ Ahmed Abdel Khalek. The junior is undefeated this season—starting four times in the No. 1 spot—and holds a perfect 19-0 collegiate record.
“We always expect Farag to win, but he played [Khalek], and this kid is so good,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “I thought his performance was a standout from the point of view that he didn’t have his best game on the day, and he had to fight. Whenever you have a player that’s fighting through, you’re delighted.”
Farag, who is from Egypt, impressed his teammates by overcoming tiredness from travel and remaining focused despite a tough opponent.
“I thought it was pretty amazing, given that Ali was still pretty jetlagged, for him to play such great squash… and dig in after losing one of the first few games,” Scherl added.
In the next six matches, Crimson players blanked their Bates opponents, 3-0, in each matchup. Victories by juniors Brandon McLaughlin, Gary Power, Nigel Koh, and Tommy Mullaney, sophomore Tyler Olsen, and Scherl handed Harvard an undefeated streak in the No. 2 through No. 7 slots.
“I thought the team was pretty well prepared coming off the break,” Scherl said. “We haven’t been practicing at school for a while, so I thought it was good that all the players managed to stay in good form for the match.”
Although the Crimson swept through the Bobcats’ lineup, each individual match was not as easy as the scoreboard suggested.
“Those 3-0 matches, at least half of them were very, very close and very, very hard fought,” Way said.
Playing in the No. 8 spot for the third time this season, co-captain Jason Michas maintained a perfect record for the season, defeating the Bobcats’ Jason Shrubb, 3-1. Rounding out the night for Harvard, No. 9 freshman Matt Roberts took down his opponent, Caran Arora, in a perfect 3-0 finish in which he gave up only seven points.
Now nine games into a 19 game regular season, all leading up to the CSA championships in late February, the Crimson’s toughest matchups have just begun. Before the break, Harvard took down No. 5 Rochester in its most competitive game of the season, and next weekend the Crimson travels to take on rivals Penn and Princeton.
“We may be at the halfway point on the calendar, but really the season—for those teams that are in contention—is just starting,” Way said. “It doesn’t feel like the halfway point at all. It feels like we are at the bottom of the main hill… the last bit of climb up Everest.”
Harvard used the matchup against Bates to adjust back to a match environment which can be very different from practice. With spectators in the court, the body heat causes a temperature rise that can change the way the ball moves.
“There were a bunch of Bates fans around from the Boston area, and that always brings up the heat in the courts,” Scherl said. “The ball gets a little bouncier, and it’s harder to put away the opponent, even if you are a little better than them.”
While the Crimson defeated the Bobcats handily, the team was happy to be back on the court preparing for its big matchups, both of which tend to draw large crowds.
“It’s always good to get a somewhat more comfortable match experience right before going into a big weekend like the one we’re going into now,” Scherl said.
After the month-long break, the dismantling of Bates ensures that Harvard will carry its undefeated streak into its second and third Ivy League matchups of the season next weekend.
“The team is excited they’re back,” Way said. “What more can we say? I think we’re ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having entered Wednesday night’s game at Agganis Arena winless in its last six games, the Harvard men’s hockey team scored four straight goals en route to a comeback victory against No. 8 Boston University.
Down by three goals at two separate points in the contest, at 3-0 in the second period and 5-2 entering the third, the Crimson was able to storm back and tie the game up at five before regulation time ended.
Sophomore forward Colin Blackwell knotted the score with less than four minutes left in the third, taking advantage his own dump pass mishandled by Terrier goalie Matt O’Connor.
The teams traded opportunities in the extra frame before Harvard put the game away. Sophomore Tommy O’Regan, whose younger brother Danny suited up for the Terriers, scored one goal and assisted two others, including the game-winner. O'Regan passed puck up the ice to senior Connor Morrison, who found himself all alone in front of the net and sent a slap-shot past O’Connor for his first goal of the season.
“Obviously we are pretty excited to get the win,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think a lot of our guys just stayed with it, we put ourselves behind the eight-ball early, but we were getting chances.”
On the other side, BU coach Jack Parker was less pleased with his team's performance.
“I thought the way we played in the third period was a disgrace,” Parker said. “I thought the way Harvard played in the third period was a feather in their cap. They played so hard and they kept coming after us. But we just made it easier for them with the way that we played.”
Entering the third period down three goals, Harvard slowly edged its way back after some motivation from the coach and some upperclassmen at intermission.
“We got a little momentum, after the second we got a little fired up in the locker room,” O’Regan said. “We just said we are going to come out and we are going to win this game. We had a couple big goals and a big one at the end to tie it up and I think we just kept it buzzing into overtime.”
The Crimson began to claw its way back in the third with goals at 6:38 and 8:45 from seniors Marshall Everson and Luke Greiner – the latter on a power paly - before Blackwell evened the score.
BU outshot Harvard on the game, 43-35, while Crimson junior goalie Raphael Girard stopped 38 to O’Connor's 35.
O’Regan added two assists and a goal, matching his brother’s point total in the first contest between the two at the collegiate level.
“[Danny] got the [second] goal for them,” the elder O’Regan said. “It kind of lit a fire under me a little bit. Either way in just the game itself I was trying to compete as hard as I could…I tried not to make eye contact; I just wanted to focus on the game.”
“[Danny] got three points. His brother got three points. His brother got the win, so it was a pretty good game for his brother,” Parker added. “It was a nice game for the O’Regan family.”
Greiner recorded two assists in addition to his goal. Freshman Brian Hart also scored on the power play, giving Harvard two power play goals in three opportunities on the night.
BU opened the scoring the first frame with goals from freshman forwards Wesley Myron and Danny O’Regan on rebound opportunities.
Later, Wade Megan showed persistence with a goal near the right crease on his second attempt on a rebound just 50 seconds into the second period.
“They won a lot of battles at the front of our net,” Donato said. “Anytime you get three or four whacks before you score - those are goals we need to eliminate”
But Harvard finally responded at 2:29 in the second period. O’Regan received the puck from junior defenseman John Caldwell and sent a wrist shot from center through the legs of O’Connor.
The Crimson cut the lead to one with the power play goal by Hart, but the Terriers' Matt Nieto scored a goal about a minute later that Donato called a “bit of a heartbreaker,” killing some Harvard momentum.
O’Regan of BU added another goal to make it 5-2 before the Crimson scored four unanswered goals on the way its highest total since the six it scored against Cornell in the semifinals of the ECAC playoffs last year.
“It’s a nice win for us and will hopefully springboard a lot of positive energy for the team,” Donato said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a matchup between teams going in opposite direction, Jeremy Lin ’10 and the Rockets won their fifth straight game, 125-112, over the Los Angeles Lakers—dealing the Kobe Bryant-led squad its fourth straight loss. After recording only three points in the first half, Lin poured in 16 during the third and fourth quarters as the Rockets outscored the Lakers 66-50 in the second half. It was the third straight game that the Rockets overcame a double-digit deficit.
The Rockets rank first in the NBA in points per game and feature an MVP candidate in shooting guard James Harden but allowed the Lakers to score 62 points in the first half. However, Carlos Delfino’s four three pointers in the first half kept the score close and the team trailed by only three points at the break. In the third quarter, the Rockets outscored the Lakers by 12 points and Lin added nine points and three assists.
The Rockets are 14-6 at home on the season and have won 10 of their last 12 contests, with Harden scoring over 25 points in each game. They are within two games of the Golden State Warriors for fifth in the Western Conference, while the loss dropped the Lakers four games out of a playoff spot.
In the second quarter, Lakers point guard Steve Nash recorded his 10,000th assist, a small consolation in wake of the team’s fourth straight loss to a playoff teamfrom last year. On the heels of a 5-1 stretch that represented its best run of the season, the team lost All-Stars Dwight Howard (torn labrum) and Pau Gasol (concussion) indefinitely and while Gasol was home seeing a doctor, Howard nursed his injury on the bench in street clothes.
Lin finished an efficient 7-of-13 from the field en route to his 19 points, mixing driving layups with pull-up three pointers on the break. In the first half, Lin played more off the ball and set screens for Carlos Delfino, who hit five three-pointers in the game. Lin and backcourt mate Harden combined for 50 points, 14 assists, and 12 rebounds on the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team picked up its first match of the new year right where it left off.  The Crimson entered Wednesday night’s contest at the Murr Squash Center riding a three game win streak to close out its 2012 schedule.
In its first match of 2013, Harvard (4-0, 1-0 Ivy) dominated from top to bottom and posted a perfect 9-0 win over Bates. The match against the Bobcats was the last time the Crimson plays at home before hitting the road to face some tough Ivy League competition.
“It was good match preparation for [this coming] weekend,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said of her team’s outing against Bates. “We have a big one coming up. We’re on the road in some really competitive Ivy League matches. It was good to put our training to the test and switch it up from just playing each other.”
It was a long winter break for Harvard, as the Crimson did not play a match for over a month.  But the team reconvened on campus earlier this week in preparation for this week’s competition. There were no signs of rust despite the time off, as Harvard failed to surrender a single game to the Bobcats, with all ten matches on the court taken by a 3-0 margin. The Crimson won every game by at least five points.
“We were really pleased with the results,” said fellow co-captain Natasha Kingshott. “The Bates match was really important for us to test ourselves after the holiday break.”
It was a quick and easy win for sophomore Amanda Sobhy, who made her season debut in the number one position after being sidelined by injury in the Crimson’s earlier matches. The reigning individual national champion breezed through with 11-2, 11-3, and 11-1 wins against Bates senior Cheri Ann Parris.
Fellow sophomore Haley Mendez capped a quick win with 11-1, 11-2, 11-1 victories over Myriam Kelly of the Bobcats. Mendez, who last year was named a CSA second team All-American, improved to a perfect 3-0 on the season in the number two spot.
There were a few familiar faces notably absent from the Harvard lineup. Senior Laura Gemmell, who started in the number one seed earlier this year, was sidelined with an injury and forced to rest this week. But even with a few key players out, the Crimson easily handled Bates in the rest of its matches.
Freshman Michelle Gemmell improved to 2-0 in her debut season with 11-2, 11-4, and 11-4 wins in the third spot. Fellow first year Isabelle Dowling is now 4-0 on the year, after taking down her opponent, 11-5, 11-6, and 11-2, in the number six position.
Kingshott and Mumanachit cleaned up quickly in the number four and five matches, respectively. The co-captains posted identical 11-1, 11-4, and 11-6 wins. Fellow senior Eliza Calihan improved to a perfect 4-0 on the year with an 11-4, 11-5, and 11-3 win over Samantha Matos of the Bobcats.
Rounding out the top nine, junior Natasha Anzik posted the only shutout game in the top nine matches.  She opened with a perfect 11-0 victory over Emma Kroein, then followed that with back-to-back 11-3 wins to easily take down her opponent.
Playing at number 10, junior Georgiana Brinkley posted the most dominant victory of the evening.  Brinkley allowed just three points, going 11-1, 11-2, and 11-0, and improved to 2-1 on the season.
The match against Bates provided a last minute tune up before Harvard hits the road to take on Ivy opponents Princeton and Penn this weekend. The match against the Bobcats marks an important milestone as the Crimson gears up for the second part of its season, where it generally faces stiffer competition against conference foes.
“This is definitely the part of the season we have been looking towards,” Mumanachit said.
With a conference road trip a few days away, Harvard looks to keep its unbeaten streak alive. The Crimson has not dropped a match in the top nine in any of its outing this season, having posted identical 9-0 victories in all four matches thus far.
“We were really happy to have the opportunity to play Bates this week to help mentally and physically prepare ourselves for this weekend,” Kingshott said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During Wednesday night’s contest between the Rockets (21-15) and Hornets (10-25), the ball was in Jeremy Lin ’10’s hands early and often, but the Harvard grad failed to put up major numbers, only registering nine points for Houston in a nine-point loss.
Despite playing 42 minutes, Lin failed to reach double-digit points while his teammate James Harden tallied 25 points for the Rockets. The game marked his 14th consecutive game in which he scored at least 25 points, a new franchise record.
Although he struggled to find the hoop, Lin found other ways to lead the offense, notching a team-high five assists and a game-high five steals. He currently leads the team in assists per game (6.3) and steals per game (1.9).
Lin struggled through a scoring drought in the fourth quarter, but tallied two points for Houston with a jump shot in the final five seconds of the contest, bringing the final score to 88-79.
Lin and the Rockets face the Celtics (18-17) hoping to start another winning streak after having their five-game run snapped by the Hornets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overtime has been quite the struggle for the Harvard men’s hockey program of late.
The Crimson had not won a regular season game in extra time in over five years—since November 20, 2007, when Doug Rogers ’10 put home the game-winner to give Harvard a 2-1 win at BU.
After that night, the Crimson went winless in its next 31 overtime matches, and it also failed to emerge victorious from Agganis Arena, home of its intracity rival and one of the nation’s best squads.
But that all changed Wednesday, when six different players scored for Harvard (5-7-1) to twice help it storm back from a three-goal deficit and stun the No. 8 Terriers (11-7-0).
The Crimson scored thrice in the final 15 minutes of the third period before senior forward Connor Morrison’s breakaway overtime goal with 48 seconds remaining beat Matt O’Connor and sealed a thrilling 6-5 comeback victory.
Two years ago, it was a 5-4 win over the Terriers in the Beanpot consolation game that sparked the Crimson—4-18-1 to that point—to a late-season resurgence, as Harvard went on to win seven of its next eight.
The Crimson—which had entered Wednesday’s game winless in its last six—now hopes an equally dramatic and improbable win over BU initiates a similar run.
“I think this group really believes in itself and things really haven’t gone their way as of a late,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s a real close group—[they] really enjoy working hard for each other—so hopefully a win like this allows them to play with some confidence.”
O’BROTHER!
Brothers Tommy O’Regan (a Harvard sophomore) and Danny O’Regan (a BU freshman) were both major contributors Wednesday night in their first collegiate matchup, though it was Tommy who emerged victorious.
“It [was] just cool to be out there against [Danny],” the sophomore said. “That was one of the best games that I’ve played in since I’ve been at Harvard.”
The younger O’Regan struck first, putting home a backdoor power-play one-timer with just 35 seconds remaining in the opening period to give the Terriers a 2-0 lead.
After a Megan Wade goal put BU up three, Tommy gave Harvard its first score when he fired home a wrist shot from between the circles at the 2:29 mark of the second period.
Following a power-play tally by freshman Brian Hart that cut the BU lead to 3-2, goals by Matt Nieto and the Terriers O’Regan left the Crimson in another three-score hole.
But Harvard was not to be denied, rallying back from there to tie things up. Senior Marshall Everson cut the Crimson deficit to two with a backdoor goal at the 6:38 mark and classmate Luke Greiner added a power-play tally to get the Crimson within one moments later. Colin Blackwell tied the game with under four minutes to go, collecting a loose rebound in front of the net and squeezing it past O’Connor for the equalizer.
“Among the last handful of games we’ve had some real tough bumps that didn’t go our way,” Donato said. “It was nice to get a little puck luck there on Blackwell’s goal.”
In overtime, it was the elder O’Regan who got the last laugh. The sophomore, the team leader in assists, sent a perfect centering pass to a streaking Morrison, who fired the puck past O’Connor on a breakaway to give Tommy’s Crimson the win over Danny’s Terriers.
“Tommy’s one of the most well-liked guys in the locker room,” Donato said. “Knowing Tommy he’s just as excited for his three points as for his brother Danny scoring three points. He’s just a very nice kid. It’s quite an accomplishment for the O’Regan family to have two kids playing at this level.”
GRIPES BETWEEN THE PIPES
Despite earning the win, Harvard goaltender Raphael Girard experienced another tough night in net. Though he made 38 saves, Girard allowed five goals for the fourth time in five games.
Luckily for the junior, O’Connor and the Terrier defense was no better.
“Anytime there’s that many scoring chances and goals early in the game, I don’t think [either goaltender] looked particularly comfortable,” Donato said. “[But] they are both excellent goalies.”
Terriers coach Jack Parker was far more displeased with his defense’s performance.
“Our entire core of defenseman was out to lunch,” Parker said. “As the game progressed they got worse and worse.”
“We acted like the game was over when we made it 5-2, and then we just went to sleep and couldn’t get it back,” he added. “When they scored the third goal, their bench erupted and my team just died. I don’t think I had one guy who played well—five goals and not one guy played well. I don’t remember being this disappointed in a BU team in a long time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Ivy League play right around the corner, Harvard leads the conference with an 8-5 non-conference record. While the variability of non-conference schedules from team to team make it difficult to judge the Crimson’s Ancient Eight competition based on their records, first half matchups provide valuable insight about the strengths and weaknesses of each team.Columbia (8-6)
The Lions are second only to the Crimson in scoring, averaging 65.6 points per game. However, perhaps more dangerous is Columbia’s defensive capability. Led by senior guard Brian Barbour—with 13.4 points per game and 5.1 assists per game—the Lions have the best turnover margin in the conference. Barbour’s ability to control the ball while putting up big points will give Crimson freshman point guard Siyani Chambers a run for his money and keep Columbia in the hunt.
Princeton (6-7)
Ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll, the Tigers have suffered a number of frustrating losses in games that they led. In December they let an 11 point second-half lead slip away in a 63-60 loss to Fordham, a team that Harvard defeated soundly, 73-64. The Tigers have been plagued by inconsistent perimeter shooting, but strong post play—most notably by senior forward Ian Hummer with 16.2 points per game and 6.6 rebounds per game—ensures that Princeton will be a contender despite its slow start.
Cornell (7-9)
The Big Red has been unable to make up for its defensive lapses with a mediocre offense. The team has allowed 69 points per game—good for second to last in the league—while putting up only 64 and sits solidly in the middle of the pack in field goal and three point percentage. The team lacks an offensive sparkplug, with leading scorer Shonn Miller netting only 10.8 points per game.
Brown (5-8)
The Bears have struggled to develop a physical game, failing to draw fouls and collect points from the stripe. Brown’s free throw attempts are good for last in the league, and the team hasn’t made up for it from the field, where it is shooting 39 percent. The low scoring squad has shown promising interior defense but has struggled to protect the perimeter. The Bears’ opponents have the highest three-point percentage in the conference.
Yale (5-11)
The Bulldogs have taken advantage of a big frontcourt to become the highest rebounding team in the league, but they have struggled to find a defensive rhythm and are only holding their opponents to a 45.2 field goal percentage—the highest of the Ancient Eight. Leading scorers Austin Morgan (11.6 points per game) and Justin Sears (10.8 points per game) will have to do a lot more to make up for the porous Yale defense.
Dartmouth (3-10)
Statistically the worst team in the league, the Big Green has been outscored by an average of 9.5 points per game so far. Despite finally snapping a seven-game losing streak with a 75-58 win over Army last week, Dartmouth is shooting a league-low 36.2 percent from the field—including 29.7 percent from deep. The Big Green’s positive turnover margin will not be enough to overcome its lack of rebounding—especially on defense—and general inability to create scoring opportunities.
Penn (2-12)
Don’t count the Quakers out yet. Despite holding the worst record in the conference, Penn’s first half statistics can be deceiving. Although the Quakers have allowed the most points per game, they have held their opponents to the second lowest scoring percentage in the league and the lowest three-point percentage. With forward Fran Doughtry and guard Miles Cartwright—15.7 and 14.5 points per game, respectively—combining to form the highest-scoring duo in the Ivy League, Penn promises to be a lively matchup.

Fair peers at fair Harvard, those of you who are fair,
 
We at Flyby are here to tell you something you may already know: Only half of you are hot, and of those who are, the majority are male. Admissions mistake? Maybe. Oops!
 
According to the 2012 Boston Hotness Index, recently released by collegiate dating site DateMySchool.com, Harvard dudes are Boston's second best looking bachelors, while our ladies flank the other end of the list in last place.
 
The rankings are a result of data based on the number of times a Date My School user saves a profile versus the number of students at the college with a profile on the site. The other five schools ranked are BC (first in both categories), BU, MIT, Northeastern, and Tufts.
 
Yes, there are many problems with these rankings. They objectify women. They objectify men. They objectify individuals who would like to be considered hot but who identify as neither male or female. They objectify Boston's world-renowned network of universities, and the puerile bar graphs used to illustrate the data in the press release objectify the advances that have been made in data illustration since Microsoft Word 1998. But let's focus on the important take-aways, shall we?
 
Whatever, we lost one. Fair-ish peers, they've divided us by gender, and a university divided by gender will not stand (see all Crimson content tagged "final clubs"). But we're doing alright. We're one of the hottest academic institutions right now, which is kind of related to how we have 45 really hot students at Harvard right now, which is kind of like how we have 15 seniors you need to meet right now, which is very much like 22 Most Impressive Students at Harvard Right Now. Crimson-derivative content aside (thank you, Business Insider), the numbers tend to speak for themselves, and there are a lot of them. There are, however, few conclusive numbers involved in these rankings. Perhaps an anonymous BU student (and Date My School user) said it best in a real quotation from Date My School's press release: "Personally, I'm not surprised. The guys at my school are nowhere near as cute as the BC boys."
 
Which isn't to say there aren't problems with the math. If the data compiled are a result of number of saves vs. number of profiles on the site, couldn't one profile, as an outlier with hundreds of saves, skew the results? Like, one really hot guy from Harvard could swing the results for the other 762 Harvard males who had a profile on the site when the data was collected and released by Date My School.
 
Isn't it just generally irrelevant, anyway? Have any of you even seen AJ McCarron's girlfriend?
 
Whatever. Remember, fair peers, as the press release instructs, "students hoping to heat up the holidays with a hottie" are encouraged by Date My School co-founder Jean Meyer (hailed by some as "The French Zuckerberg") to consider a date's whole character and "'look beyond the looks.'"
 
But not too much, thx, because even though Meyer "believes modern ambition is the death of love," that's neither good for his business model nor the longevity of our most-reads.

Let the fangirl screaming begin. According to the National Enquirer, actor Robert Pattinson is considering enrolling in business school—and Harvard Business School has reportedly made his short list.
 
The National Enquirer reported last month that Pattinson may be looking to develop his business skills in the post-Twilight phase of his career in order to ultimately move into the production side of film. In addition to HBS, he is reportedly considering UCLA, the Stern School of Business at NYU, and the Wharton School at Penn.
 
While Pattinson would not be the first celebrity to take a break from life in the public eye to return to school at Harvard—cough cough, Tyra Banks—Gossip Cop has rushed to discredit the possibility that R-Pattz will be following in the footsteps of Banks. Apparently, Pattinson has enough movie roles lined up for 2013 that attending business school, even during his downtime, would prove difficult for the star.
True, HBS could provide a welcome hideaway from a life in which stepping into an airport without Kristen Stewart means endless rumors of everything from either a breakup to an engagement—or both. Though Banks was initially hesitant to live in the dorms during her time at HBS, she later said that living on campus brought her closer to her classmates.
 
But there's one thing that everyone seems to be forgetting: R-Pattz, no matter how brooding and pensive, never attended college. Considering that HBS requires a bachelor's degree for admission, it looks like the heartthrob may have to stick to playing brooding antiheros.
A rumor like this will likely go the way of Pattinson's vampire teeth and modeling career. But on the off chance that it somehow proves true, we at Flyby predict that the Harvard Hoochies may have some competition when it comes to would-be husband hunters knocking at Harvard's gates.
