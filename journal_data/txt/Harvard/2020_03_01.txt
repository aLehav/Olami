After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Netflix began creating and airing original content in 2013 with “House of Cards,” the streaming giant has continued to develop their own material — hit TV shows, quality movies, and enjoyable shorts — at an incredible rate. However, not everything Netflix drops is top quality content. With originals ranging from animated dramedies to live-action thrillers, Netflix has tried to fill every niche within entertainment. Although the quality varies, here are the five best shows across all of Netflix's original content.
5. “The Witcher”
“The Witcher” emerged from the ashes of an unsatisfying ending to the critically acclaimed and beloved “Game of Thrones.” Filling the violent/sexual/exciting niche that “Thrones” had left vacant, the show follows Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) as he adventures throughout the show’s chaotic and monster-ridden world, encountering men far worse than any dragon or djinn. Ultimately, the show captured audiences with its incredible casting and unique take on a popular video game franchise.
4. “Stranger Things”
“Stranger Things” became a quick cult phenomenon upon its release in June 2016. Centered on the lives of a rambunctious bunch of middle schoolers who find solace in playing Dungeons and Dragons together, the show dives into the supernatural as people go missing and government agents flood the once serene fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Sadly, the quality of the subsequent seasons couldn’t quite match the wonder and awe evoked by the first. Still, with a captivating soundtrack and phenomenal child actors, it’s no wonder the world over remained enraptured by the now 25-episode series.
3. “Making a Murderer”
An enthralling documentary, “Making a Murderer” examines the life of Steven Avery following his wrongful conviction and sentencing for the brutal murder and rape of Penny Beernsten. The show tracks Avery and an accessory to the murder, Brendan Dassey, as they attempt to right a two-decade-old injustice. This release set Netflix apart as a studio not only capable of creating fan-service shows and comedies, but true-crime masterpieces as well.
2. “Bojack Horseman”
It should come as no surprise that “Bojack Horseman” merits a spot on this list. Since its premiere in 2014, Netflix’s first animated TV show has somehow managed to capture audience attention, despite the titular character being an anthropomorphic horse actor caricature. The show excels as an essay on the dangers of indulgence, unrequited love, and life in general. Throughout its six seasons, the show not only incites rambunctious laughter, but genuine tears and heart-wrenching sadness as well. Representing all of the ups, downs, and sideways motions of life like no animated show ever has, “Bojack Horseman” is a masterpiece.
1. “House of Cards”
Netlflix’s best original show is also its first. Inspired by political dramas like “The West Wing,” “House of Cards” elevated the genre while drawing upon its rich history. Although forever marred by the sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey, the show remains on this list due to the quality of the first season, as well as the fact that it catapulted Netflix onto the map as a contender in the world of quality television. “House of Cards” established Netflix as an independent studio to be reckoned with.
Of course, Netflix has an immense library, much of it comprised of original content. Some other honorable mentions include “Castlevania,” an incredibly well-written anime based on the videogame of the same name, and “Orange is the New Black,” which follows a diverse cast of characters in a brutal women’s prison throughout seven high-quality seasons. The final honorable mention is “Sex Education,” which centers around a group of British high school students attempting to navigate sexual maturity with curt English humor and a lot of heart.
In the seven years that Netflix has created original content, it has earned eight Oscars, 37 Emmys, and four Golden Globes. These five shows and the honorable mentions are only a fraction of the many phenomenal works created by the streaming giant.

“If you’re alone and or been broken up wit before or on valentimes day, i have the very perfect record for you,” King Princess wrote in the caption of an Instagram post promoting her Feb. 14 release of “Cheap Queen (Deluxe).” This expanded version of her widely celebrated debut album includes a “Disc 2” with five new tracks, including one featuring singer, songwriter, and producer Banoffee and her Feb. 10 single “Ohio” and every one of them is a scathing testament to love, its pains, and its truths.
“Back of a Cab,” the infectious first new track, opens with dialogue from the 1955 short film “A Word to the Wives,” which follows a wife who tricks her husband into buying her a new kitchen based on the advice of her friend. With the inclusion of “A Word to the Wives,” King Princess appears to pay homage to her breakout hit, “1950.” By continuing to toy with the conventional gender roles that women play in traditional relationships, she turns the idea of a woman who submits to her husband on its head in “Back of a Cab.” The dialogue, then, is both unconventional and completely logical for King Princess, who further blurs the lines of gender noramtivity by referring to her her work as “gay shit” in the second verse. The film dialogue is later layered throughout the song among ethereal harmonies and a heavily reverbed saxophone, a move reminiscent of her characteristic SoundCloud remixes of celebrity quotes. Mellow pop beats bubble up under King Princess’s voice as she sings of missing the experiences she shared with her first love, like dancing in the back of a cab, despite the issues that marred their relationship. “I guess it's hard to realize that your heart never healed right / And the hard part of movin' on is you always take a piece from your last love, through your next life,” she sings over the blend of synths.
Next on the album is “All Dressed in White,” a bluesy waltz characterized by a smooth electric guitar that rises and falls with King Princess’s pleas to the “queen of her living room” as she begs for a chance to “be good” and see her dressed in white. The sultry languor of the song drags on while King Princess's voice appears to break under the weight of her longing as she sings “And it’s all my fault (I know) / I want to be yours (I’m sure) / I’m trying my best (For you, for you)” — anything to dance with her love.
“Forget About It,” featuring Banoffee, is the perfect King Princess pop song. Its fiery guitar intro mimics King Princess’s own fiery attitude towards the song’s subject: “And I thought that I would never do better / But I'm already better,” she tells them. Banoffee’s contribution to the song comes in the form of heavily autotuned cuts that betray King Princess’s guise of moving on. King Princess sings that she’s forgotten about her past flame, yet her autotune reveals that in reality she’s “waiting and waiting / For you to come, you to come.” Despite, or perhaps because of, King Princess’s feigned disinterest in her past lover, the song begs to be danced to with its syncopated beats and distorted guitar riffs.
The fourth new song, “Best Friend,” is laceratingly sweet. Its hollow, saccharine beats have the veneer of openness and second chances, but the lyrics go in the other direction, promising that she’s “gon’ be cold” towards the past partner that spurned her for another and now wants a second chance.
“Ohio” is a standout on “Disc 2,” and on all of “Cheap Queen.” Though it’s familiar to older fans — she’s been performing the number since 2018 — King Princess gives everything to this track and it shows. The song starts melodramatically, with a lone acoustic guitar as King Princess laments the effects of distance on a past relationship. “How's it been in Ohio, babe? / Do you think about me / When you're going home?” she sings. In an uncharacteristic move for King Princess, however, the song’s bridge breaks out into pure energy. Heavily distorted power chords and crashing symbols take over as King Princess lets go of her generally smooth vocals in exchange for growling and shouting. Her energy is relentless as she teases her past flame with “Come here and I’ll show you what I like about it.” King Princess is power and freedom, grunge and sincerity all at once. “Ohio” exemplifies all of this more than any other song on the album, as she indulges in a temporary break from indie pop in favor of her own special brand of rock n’ roll.

Juice, a seven-man boy band originally from Boston College, returned to their home city on Feb. 22 for a high energy, soulful performance at the Paradise Rock Club. Unconventional for both the rock and boy band worlds, Juice used violin solos, rap verses, and multi-part harmonies to express their rich, unique musical style. Unrestrained instrumental interludes embedded in almost every song made well-known songs new, and converted the venue into a full-on, awe-inspiring jam session.
The crowd erupted a couple times before the actual show began due to some technical difficulties, but eventually a vintage movie countdown initiated the music video for Juice’s newest single “DiCaprio (Love Me All the Time).” Mixing ‘90s aesthetics and urban boyhood, the video showcased the charm and camaraderie of the band for both new and longtime fans alike. Cheers for the film crescendoed when Juice walked out to “Vossi Bop” by Stormzy. Walking out to music from another artist fits their down-to-earth appeal. The eclectic seven-member band both filled and towered over the stage, sharing their excitement to be back in Boston.
With barely any verbal introduction, the band jumped into “Workin’ on Lovin,’” the title track of their 2018 EP and most streamed song on Spotify, transporting the audience to paradise. The swelling, extended track featured bass and guitar solos, the soul and range of Ben Stevens’ sonorous vocals, and most notably, an electric violin interlude that could have lasted forever without getting old. Juice violinist and vocalist Christian Rose shredded away on his metallic electric violin to the pulsating shouts of the crowd. Juice could have walked off stage after this song and the crowd would have received their money’s worth.
Fortunately, they didn’t. “Workin’ on Lovin’” rolled directly into “Peace of Mind,” one of Juice’s three 2019 singles, with a flawless instrumental interlude. “Peace of Mind” features a tamer bass melody with much more tender lyrics, making the instrumental transition all the more impressive. Vocalists Stevens and Kamau Burton displayed their skills beyond beautiful harmonies by overlaying separate verses to create the emotional crux of the song.
Juice continued their set with vigor. Whenever Stevens stopped to tell the crowd he loved them, it was out of fatigue or an overflow of joy. At several points, a minute-long break would occur with no lights, no music, no talking — the band simply needed water. Although not the kind of breaks expected from a band in their home city, they were justified by the members’ intensity on every song, especially Stevens’. Although every member of the band had their fair share of solos, practically every song was a showcase of Stevens’ range and soul. With falsettos and melodious groans, Stevens made music out of every note. His bellowing vocals carried the night.
For the eighth song of their set, Rose led the poetic rap ballad “DAVE (turn the music down).” Here, the power of the vocalist trio of Stevens, Rose, and Burton faltered from its typical smooth tone. Although talented lyricists and beautiful in harmony, the combination of the three on spoken lines was overwhelming. Juice’s rap verses were jumbled and noisy in live performance, and best utilized as accents to their melodic choruses. Nonetheless, the lyrics remain captivating and meaningful. For “DAVE,” some lyrics took on new significance this year — after a Kobe reference, the band stopped mid-beat in a moment of silence for the fallen NBA titan. If only for that moment, the room remembered the world outside Juice’s intoxicating sound.
The night continued with more energetic solos, as well as several stunning acapella harmonies, in “Sugar.” Before they replayed their latest single, “DiCaprio (Love Me All the Time),” Stevens introduced the entire band, including Daniel Moss and Michael Ricciardulli on guitar, Rami El-Abidin on the bass, Miles Clyatt on drums, and the aforementioned Rose and Burton. Finally, Juice ended the night with their emotionally charged track “Stupidfreak.”
“It’s not exactly easy to figure out what genre it is… but I like it,” said Annie Brennan, audience member and Tufts student, when asked about Juice’s music. There isn’t a more straightforward way to express the emotions Juice’s music makes you feel other than, perhaps, Brennan’s later comment — “They’ve got some jams!”
Cannon, the night’s opening artist and a former classmate of some of Juice’s members, also had some jams. Following the show, Cannon praised Juice’s music and related to their audio style.
“They formed in the same way my team kind of formed at Boston College, so it’s a very similar story which I kind of relate to,” Cannon said. The solo artist isn’t studying music at Boston College, however. “I’m an English major, but you know… ‘words.’ Words are important, that’s my shirt,” Canon shared, referring to his merch table. The Boston College camaraderie went a long way to bring this night together for both artists and the many students and alums in the audience on Saturday.
Not long after “Superfreak,” the band came back for an encore. Stevens jumped clear off the stage in the heat of the music, bringing the energy back up to full intensity to officially end a glorious evening of music.

Children’s shows usually fall into one of two categories: educational or entertaining. Some incorporate aspects of both paths, but in the broadest sense, any show can be defined as more one than the other. Shows that attempt to effectively balance the two objectives often end up compressing “important” storylines to maintain engagement. For example, children’s series like “Drake and Josh,” “Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” and “iCarly” all attempted to tackle important topics before wrapping them up in a neat bow without establishing any significant or meaningful long-term storylines.
These shows’ creators aim to entertain with serialized fiction that relies upon underdeveloped character tropes, and most of the plotlines’ educational aspects don’t last. On the other side of the spectrum, shows like “Sesame Street” and “Schoolhouse Rock!” intend to educate, but fall short of entertaining anyone over the age of six years old.
There aren’t many children’s shows with the emotional and intellectual depth that children should be exposed to. Shows like “Spongebob Squarepants,” while entertaining, do nothing to engage young audiences with any emotional or intellectual stimulation. Once children grow too old for overtly educational shows like “Blue’s Clues” and “Sesame Street,” they encounter shows whose creators stop trying to insert important storylines altogether. What’s missing are children’s shows that entertain while still teaching important life lessons. This is where “Avatar: The Last Airbender” excelled.
“Avatar,” which celebrated its 15th anniversary on Feb. 21, created characters and storylines that were far more complex than the shows it competed with. The show had important messages to convey, and it did so in a captivating and substantial way. First and foremost, the animated series depicted several characters of color while respecting the cultures that those characters came from. Though obviously influenced by anime styles, this cartoon is grounded in its nuanced depictions of East Asian and Inuit cultures.
Beyond exposing young and impressionable American audiences to a uniquely diverse cast of characters, “Avatar” created a somewhat mystical elemental bending system that was represented as a spiritual and cultural phenomenon rather than a generic set of superpowers. The show introduced a tyrannical ruler and generated vehement opposition towards this ruler throughout its three seasons, but in the end, the series still focused on the importance of peace, redemption, and respect for all forms of life. The show’s main character, Aang, repeatedly emphasizes how important it is to remain peaceful in the fight for peace.
The show featured some single-episode storylines, but each episode still motivated the show’s overall progression — no episode was unimportant in terms of story or character development. Speaking of character development, “Avatar” created one of the most surprising, authentic, and compelling examples of a redemptive character arc in its main villain, Zuko, who changed his ways and ultimately helped to dismantle the tyranny he once exemplified.
“Avatar” also featured several powerful female characters, some of whom were stereotypically feminine and some of whom were not. The show’s danger had real and intense stakes — some characters were even killed. Even so, it remained child-appropriate and light-hearted in nature whilst balancing these difficult and important topics. There was humor and levity that made the characters likeable, but this did not detract from the more intense aspects of the very same characters. This show stands out in the lineup of children’s television for the thought and effort put into creating something important and entertaining for both children and their parents.
Many who watched “Avatar” as children are influenced for life by its messages and themes. The complexity of this show rivals the genius of “Harry Potter,” but all within the context of a children’s television program broadcasted alongside series as inane as “Spongebob Squarepants.” “Avatar: The Last Airbender” should be considered the greatest and most important work in all of children’s television.

UPDATED: March 1, 11:13 p.m
Harvard has restricted travel to Italy and Iran amid an outbreak of coronavirus cases in the two countries, according to an email from University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen Saturday.
The email came a day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued Level 3 warnings for COVID-19 in Italy and Iran Friday, recommending that Americans avoid “all nonessential travel.”
“University travel to Italy, Iran, South Korea and mainland China is restricted until further notice,” the email read.
The Office of Career Services’ Summer Grants and Funding Office announced on its website that, due to uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, it will not provide funding for travel to any countries under restriction.
As of Sunday afternoon, Italy has reported more than 1,100 cases of the novel coronavirus and 34 deaths. Iran has reported over 900 cases of coronavirus, including over 300 since Friday. The BBC released a report this week estimating that 210 individuals have died in Iran due to the outbreak, but Iranian officials have only confirmed 54 deaths as of Sunday.
Italy and Iran join China and South Korea on Harvard’s list of travel-restricted countries — all of which have Level 3 warnings from the CDC, as well as additional travel warnings from the U.S. State Department.
Harvard affiliates who had registered an upcoming trip to Italy in International SOS MyTrips received an email around noon on Saturday from Harvard Global Support Services announcing that Harvard had canceled all travel to Italy.
“In accordance with the University’s policy for COVID-19 travel restrictions, Harvard-related travel to Italy is restricted until further notice,” the email read.
OCS also sent an email Friday afternoon to certain students who had received funding to study abroad this coming summer, notifying them of the cancellation of awards for travel to restricted countries.
“No funding will be awarded for travel to any destination under Provostial restriction, and Harvard may rescind sponsorship of previously-approved planned travel if warranted prior to your departure,” the email read.
The email also noted changes to the OCS’s summer funding policy due to the cancellations. Students are permitted to accept a Harvard Summer School Study Abroad award even if they are not fully committed to traveling due to uncertainty regarding coronavirus. They also are allowed to change their decision as to whether they will accept or decline summer funding after the fact.
According to the Global Support Services’s website, University affiliates will face restrictions on travel to any country that receives a Level 3 CDC warning in the future.
University Spokesperson Jason Newton declined to comment further on the restrictions, pointing to the guidance posted to the Global Support Services and Harvard University Health Services’s websites.

In its final home game of the season, Harvard suffered an upset 55-47 defeat to Cornell after losing a decisive game less than twenty four hours earlier.
As the game clock wound down, tears fell from the face of senior forward Jeannie Boehm, who finished with 12 rebounds and seven blocks before fouling out in what will most likely be her last game ever on the hardwood of Lavietes Pavilion. Sitting on the bench with a towel draped over her face, Boehm shared an emotional moment with Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, who embraced her longtime player.
Also on the bench sat senior co-captain Mackenzie Barta, who sustained an injury in a game against Princeton at the start of the month that forced her collegiate career to an early finish.
Saturday’s loss was rife with significance not only for the two seniors but for the entire Harvard squad.
The defeat extends the Crimson’s losing streak to five games and all but surely excludes Harvard (14-11, 5-7 Ivy) from a berth in the Ivy League Tournament — the first time the Crimson will not qualify since the tournament began three years ago.
This season’s results signify a blip in Delaney-Smith’s illustrious Ivy League coaching career. On Saturday night, she tried coming to terms with the results of the game and of the season more broadly.
“Not meant to be,” she said.
Still, Delaney-Smith said her players — many of whom assumed major roles on the team this season for the first time — should be proud of their accomplishments. Highlights of Harvard’s play this season include mounting a comeback against University of California, defeating Ivy League powerhouse Penn, and snapping Yale’s undefeated record.
“This whole season I think we overachieved,” she said. “We had no right doing what we did.”
Given these previous successes, Harvard’s loss on Saturday night was partially unexpected.
Entering the game, the Big Red (10-14, 3-9 Ivy) had only eked out two conference wins all season. The Crimson also had history on its side, having bested Cornell by 15 points only two weeks ago.
Harvard has not won a game since that contest.
The Crimson stepped onto the court Saturday evening still reeling from its devastating loss to Columbia just a day ago. That loss put into serious doubt Harvard’s prospects of competing in the Ivy League Tournament and made Saturday’s game all the more crucial.
From the start, the Big Red ran the Crimson off the court. Cornell attacked Harvard players on offense, repeatedly scoring uncontested breakaway layups. On defense, the Big Red came out in a full court press that forced the Crimson to rush. Though Harvard players had a bevy of opportunities to score, they could not convert on most of those plays. The Crimson amassed a 19-point deficit in the first ten minutes alone.
Though Harvard’s loss symbolized the looming conclusion to its season, aspects of the Crimson’s Saturday performance also foreshadow a successful future for the young team.
Freshman guards Annie Stritzel and Lola Mullaney led Harvard’s effort, scoring 18 points and 17 points, respectively. Stritzel invigorated Harvard’s offense and evinced versatility by knocking down three triples and repeatedly navigating through traffic to finish in the lane.
Delaney-Smith said she was impressed by Stritzel’s performance.
“It was phenomenal. I thought it was gritty and tough,” she said. “And, you know, ‘nobody can stop me’ kind of mentality.”
Mullaney complemented Stritzel’s play, notching five three pointers in the game herself despite a slow start.
With two minutes remaining, Harvard trailed by 10 points. Still, Boehm gathered her teammates into a huddle. Though by that point the Crimson’s forthcoming defeat seemed inevitable, in this moment — as in many others — the team came together.
Stritzel said the team’s culture fosters unity.
“I've never met more girls who will put everything on the line and sacrifice everything for each other,” she said. “I think this team, it's just part of our culture. That's just who we are.”
“And I feel that every time we step on the court together. We win together, we lose together.”
With just over a minute to play, Harvard, still trailing by 10 points, presented a full court press. Stritzel intercepted a desperate Cornell pass, grabbed a long offensive rebound off of a teammate’s missed shot, and shot and sunk a triple. Cornell coughed up the ball on the ensuing play and Stritzel wasted little time. She quickly knocked down another three — this time from NBA range — bringing the game within four points and sending the Harvard crowd to its feet.

For any recordkeepers, Harvard’s Saturday night victory over Cornell was a good night.
The Crimson earned its 20th win of the season, its most since the team last made the NCAA Tournament in 2014-2015. Coach Tommy Amaker also notched his 250th career win at Harvard, one that formally clinched one of four spots in the Ivy League Tournament.
But despite the important result, the 67-58 victory was hardly one in which the Crimson’s all-time winningest head coach will likely remember by the time the team disembarks from its 5-hour bus ride back to Cambridge.
“Not pleased with our overall performance and how we played, but certainly winning on a Saturday night in our conference, on the road, is something to be proud of,” Amaker said. “But I’m certainly not proud of our 19 turnovers, we just looked disjointed.”
The two sides were toe-to-toe for much of the first half, as a Harvard side possessing much stronger talent struggled to break free to a more comfortable margin. Timely triples from Big Red guards Bryan Knapp and Dean Noll kept the Crimson lead to just one at the 5:26 mark of the first frame. Without star forward Jimmy Boeheim for the second straight week, Cornell relied on its guard play for the bulk of its scoring in the contest.
But a timely 8-2 run to end the half — compounded by a string of four triples from Harvard’s Rio Haskett, Noah Kirkwood, and Danilo Djuricic to kick off the latter frame — seemingly brought the Crimson back to its contest at home against the Big Red, in which it cruised to an 85-63 win. The Crimson widened its margin to 20 with 13:44 left to play, benefiting from the slashing of first-year Chris Ledlum.
The Big Red, sensing a need to disrupt Harvard’s flow, subsequently bulked up its full-court press and zone defense. Without senior floor leader Christian Juzang, who suffered what appeared to be a right foot injury the night prior against Columbia, Harvard struggled to maintain its composure in the latter part of the second frame.
Committing a total of 11 turnovers in the final 13:20 of the contest, the Crimson saw its lead dwindle to single-digits by the six-minute turn and failed to score a field goal in the last 11:33 of play.
Saving Harvard from further trouble was its accurate free-throw shooting. Hitting 19-of-25 in the second half including 16-of-20 in its dry spell, the Crimson kept Cornell separated by at least seven points to conclude the contest.
“We can’t put all of that on not having Juzang,” Amaker said. “But a lot to learn, and a lot to get better from, but I am proud of our guys winning on Saturday night.”
Junior guard Rio Haskett knocked down three triples in the contest and finished in double-digits at 11 points for the second straight game, while senior Robert Baker contributed a dozen to lead the visiting side.
Harvard sits tied in second-place and a game back from Yale in the Ancient Eight table after the Bulldog’s perfect 2-0 weekend over Penn and Princeton. If both teams can take care of business on Saturday against Brown and Dartmouth, respectively, the Crimson will have a chance to earn a share of the title against the Bulldogs on Saturday night.

With this weekend’s Ivy League Championship, the men’s swimming and diving team has claimed the title for the fourth consecutive year, a streak it hadn’t matched since the 1998-2001 seasons. The Crimson entered the meet tied for twenty-third in the national rankings — highest among its Ivy League competitors — and came out on top with 1,439 points over Princeton’s 1,231.
Prior to the meet, Senior co-captain Daniel Chang said “Our team has shown so much heart this season. In the end, our success is not dependent on single individuals, but the collective efforts of the entire team. We’re excited to see how everyone brings their best next week.”
After the meet, junior co-captain Michael Zarian summed up Harvard’s exceptional all-around performance while echoing Chang’s words. “We won the meet because nearly everyone out-swam what was expected of them,” Darian said. “Unlike a dual meet, the conference meet is won by getting more swimmers into A and B finals than other teams. Having everyone step up and sneak into the final heats provided us with a lot of depth to score more.”
Day one opened with the 200-yard medley relay of first-year Will Grant, sophomore Jared Simpson, sophomore Umitican Gures, and junior Mahlon Reihman finishing second in 1:16.34. Afterwards, the 800-yard freestyle relay of Reihman, junior Corban Rawls, Zarian, and first-year Marcus Holmquist secured first in an NCAA B-cut time of 6:20.96.
Day two of the event began with first-year Cole Kuster beating out Dartmouth’s Connor LaMastrain in the 500-yard freestyle by 0.49 seconds to win the individual champion honors, with a season-best 4:18.17. Kuster’s exceptional swimming continued through days three and four, when he won his second individual champion honors in the 1,000-yard freestyle.
Kuster bested Princeton’s Dylan Porges by 0.44 seconds with a time of 8:57.24, providing a key points boost as the Crimson and Tigers had gone back and forth throughout the earlier events of night three. On the fourth and final night, Kuster placed second in the 1,650-yard freestyle with a 15:10.30 to close out his stellar performance in the event.
Also on night two, Zarian took third in the 200-yard IM in 1:44.51, and Gures placed second in the 50-yard freestyle, 0.17 seconds shy of first.
“We just got better and better as the weekend went on,” said senior co-captain Daniel Chang. “Every fast performance “fired up the entire team moving onto the next race … we built on the momentum and it showed in the final team scores.” After the meet, Chang was named the Harold Ulen Career High Point Swimmer, having tallied 289 points over his four-year career.
Day three saw the Crimson well-represented in the 200-yard freestyle championship finals, as Rawls won the individual champion honors in 1:34.75, edging out second place by 0.23 seconds. Rawls was followed by Holmquist and Reihman in fourth with a 1:35.64 and fifth with a 1:35.94 (NCAA B-cut times), respectively. Sophomore Jacob Johnson finished fourth in the 100-yard butterfly, in an NCAA B-cut time of 46.58, while Zarian earned another trip to the podium, finishing second in the 400-yard IM with a 3:46.77.
The 400-yard medley relay of Grant, junior Charles Vaughan, Gures, and Rawls placed second in 3:09:09 behind Columbia. Gures continued to rack up points, as he set a new Blodgett Pool and program record en route to winning the 100-yard butterfly with a 45.27.
On the diving side, junior Alec DeCaprio and senior Austin Fields dove in 1-meter dive finals, placing fifth and sixth, respectively. Fields and DeCaprio continued to represent Harvard well in the 3-meter dive consolation finals, finishing second and fourth with 328.20 and 313.95 points, respectively. First-year Luke Foster finished eighth with a 305.85.
On the final day of competition, the Crimson once again performed well in the championship finals — this time in the 200-yard backstroke — as Grant won individual champion honors with an NCAA B-cut time of 1:41.49, followed by Zarian and Simpson in fourth and eighth, respectively. Sophomore Jake Johnson placed second in the 200-yard butterfly with an NCAA B-cut time of 1:43.07, and the 400-yard freestyle relay of Reihman, Rawls, Holmquist, and junior Levente Bathory closed the meet with a third-place 2:54.44.
After that, Harvard cheered as coaches jumped off the diving boards into the pool, celebrating their fourth consecutive Ivy League Championship title. Harvard swimmer Dean Farris, who holds the NCAA and American record in the 200-yard freestyle (1:29.15) did not compete this season as he trains for the Olympics. Competing without Farris at this year’s Ivy Championship revealed the true depth and talent of this year’s Crimson squad and the promising future ahead.
Several Crimson swimmers will continue to swim at the NCAA Championships on March 25-28 in Indianapolis, Indiana, while several divers will be competing at the NCAA Zone A Championships on March 9-11 in Morgantown, W.V.
