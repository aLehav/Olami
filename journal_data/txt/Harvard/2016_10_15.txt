After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Conviction Integrity Unit is "the fox guarding the henhouse," according to Hayes Morrison, the protagonist of “Conviction.” The CIU reevaluates legal cases for those that are incarcerated yet claim to be innocent to see if a wrongful conviction was made. The show, created by Liz Friedlander and Liz Friedman, has an intriguing plot, protagonist, and structure; yet it is bizarrely unsuccessful at using music to create scenes with emotional atmospheres.
The structure of the episode and the twist and turns the cast take to uncover the truth about these wrongful convictions are attention-grabbing. The fact that the team switches their minds back and forth between whether they believe the incarcerated man, Odell Dwyer (Maurice Williams), is innocent or not is successfully unpredictable and interesting. Additionally, several conflicts were introduced in the episode, not all of which had to do with the case the CIU was working on. These conflicts of family drama, romantic interests, and reputation combine to create a noteworthy, multifaceted structure and plot.
Hayley Atwell convincingly portrays the character of Hayes Morrison, a former president’s daughter and the black sheep of her family. Hayes is arrested for cocaine possession, and then blackmailed to lead the CIU. Her character is scandalously frank, as evidenced by comedic snippets. She tells an adversary to leave her in her cell, saying she wants to “suck up the ‘Orange is the New Black’ vibe, maybe have a little ménage a moi.” Her go-to strategy in getting a box of information from a man is to suggest that he can touch her breasts if he hands over the box. When she learns Odell Dwyer’s reason for buying a gun, she tells him outright, “That’s the dumbest thing I have ever heard.” Atwell plays Hayes Morrison as amusing, uncensored, and cool.
Cinematographically, the show is largely unambitious. One scene, however, is particularly well edited and parallels characters Tess Larson (Emily Kinney) and Frankie Cruz (Manny Montana) and the murder victim as they run through the forest. The rapid succession from one sprint to the other and then back successfully deepens the intrigue over the case and the victim. This frenzied scene adds thrill to an otherwise inactive, dialogue-rich episode.
The music for the show, however, is tone-deaf to the atmosphere of the scenes in which it appears. It is difficult to take Hayes’s emotional moment with her mother about the direction that Hayes’s life has taken seriously because the music is too loud and overwhelming. In a theoretically moving scene that the CIU has with Dwyer, the music is too fast-paced and is better suited for an action movie. The music fails to reflect the tension that the show is trying to achieve.
“Conviction” has a compelling, complicated plot and structure. The music does not successfully create an emotional atmosphere, but the protagonist makes up for it. Overall, the show entertains, so it is worth watching the next episode to find out what Hayes meant by saying, “Why be the fox in the henhouse, when I can be the wolf that mauls the fox and anyone else that gets in our way.”

Over 90 years after its original performance in 1926, “The Plough and The Stars” still resonated in its production at the American Repertory Theater. Directed by Sean Holmes, it ran from Sept. 24 to Oct. 9. Sean O’Casey’s play brings together former soldiers, mothers, communists, rebels, prostitutes and more to illustrate the impact on working-class Irish people of the years leading up to Easter Rising. Primarily, “The Plough and The Stars” focuses on the controversial politics of pre-war Ireland, but the show is more than that. As a story of love and loss, desperation, mental illness, and pride, Holmes’s modern rendition of “The Plough and the Stars” has continued relevance today. Despite the actors’ inability to fully bring the characters to life, the visually striking set and special effects made “The Plough and he Stars” a worthwhile show.
Holmes nearly demolished the fourth wall: Characters often spoke directly to the audience, developing an intense intimacy. A downside to the characters in “The Plough and the Stars” is that many of them come off as stock characters, such as the nosy neighbor, the self-righteous prostitute, and the town drunk with a dark past, and many of the actors did little to portray convincing characters with whom the audience can sympathize, with the notable exception of witty and loveable Covey (Ciarán O’Brien). Additionally, during the first two acts, the eclectic cast tended to feel overwhelming, with the frequent skirmishes between characters bordering between annoying and comical.
That being said, a time leap from the year before the rebellion to the week of the rebellion created a stark contrast that allowed great character growth and transformation. For example, Nora Clitheroe’s (Kate Staley Brennan) miscarriage marks a major turning point in the plot; Brennan executed her role brilliantly from this point onward, almost unrecognizably transforming her character. Similarly, the incident prompted Hilda Fay to convincingly reinvent her character, Bessie Burgess, from a raging alcoholic to a maternal figure.
What the show lacked in characterization, it made up for in special effects.Throughout Act II, the bartender (Ger Kelley) turns on the television to update the characters on the status of the rebellion. Rather than the television being a set piece, the lights and the characters’ gaze shifted to the audience, a dramatic image that amplifies the tension about the revolution. The transition between Act II and III was even more awe-inspiring, as the set literally collapsed on itself to form a new set. The towering metallic structure that represented the tenement building fell down on its side to become a two level structure where the characters hid while violence and chaos ensued outside.
A massive, multi-purpose metal structure dominated the stage, spanning from floor to ceiling. This piece was used in a number of ways and provided more space for characters to act—or merely to sit in to maintain their presence. For example, Mollser (Rachel Gleeson), who begins the play with a beautiful Irish ballad that ends in a bloody cough indicative of tuberculosis, ascended to the top of the structure at the beginning of Act I and stayed there for nearly its entirety. In doing so, she symbolized a threat looming over the other characters for the duration of the first act, which made Fluther Good’s (David Ganly) coughing especially unnerving. The remainder of the set that lay in the shadow of the structure became increasingly cluttered throughout the first two acts, which augmented the sense of anarchy.
Lighting and sound designers Paul Keogan and Phillip Stewart respectively should receive great praise for their work on “The Plough and the Stars.” In Act III, gunshots echoed throughout the theater, contributing to an immersive, tense atmosphere. Between acts, blaring rock music accompanied by flashing lights and Mollser’s dancing built stress and excitement.
“The Plough and the Stars” is very much an action-driven plot, but the play also includes political and philosophical debates, often sparked by Covey (Cirián O’Brien), reflecting on timeless controversies such as knowledge versus faith. Musical interludes such as the love song Jack (Ian Lloyd Anderson) sang to his wife, Nora, contributed to plot and characterization while simultaneously providing a break from the intense action.
Although a true sense of sincerity among the actors did not emerge until later in the play, Holmes, Keogan, Stewart, and set designer Jon Bausor created a powerful experience that revived and reinvented “The Plough and the Stars” as a relevant show. The ART’s production explored how individuals band together in times of unrest regardless of differences or conflicts of interest, making for an emotionally striking adventure.

A psychotic toddler, a pair of sadistic lovers, the ghost of a Southern woman, a high-school prom queen—these characters and more inhabited the wonderfully chaotic world of “35mm,” Ryan Scott Oliver’s experimental collage of pop-rock tunes set to a backdrop of compelling photographs taken by Matthew Murphy. Throughout the 90-minute run time, songs by turn intimate and energizing explored everything from romance to religion. Although no discernible plot threaded all of this together, the production still cohered as a charismatic and captivating product, just as the best musicals always do.
“35mm” starred five cast members in a variety of roles: Geoffrey G. Binney ’17, Brian A. Cami ’19, Ashley LaLonde ’20, Brooke E. Sweeney ’17, and Jacob D. Rienstra ’18. Each scene centered on particular photographs projected in the background, with some photographs, specifically those corresponding to emotional solos, getting more attention than others. “The Party Goes with You” stood as a particularly powerful example of the integration: During Sweeney’s enchanting solo, the screen lingered on a wistful picture of a balloon-holding man walking away from the photographer, highlighting a potent undercurrent of loss.
The integration of photography overall was effective, acting as an extremely minimal set design that provided jarring and puzzling visuals while avoiding distraction, focusing attention on the actors. Director Missy Dreier ’19’s lighting choices were similarly restrained but successful: Some of the more energetic rock anthems, for example, were cued excellently to red spotlights, adding to the intensity of those moments.
But the real highlight was the singing; though there were just five actors in the cast, each clearly gave it their all. Every member got a powerhouse solo: LaLonde stunned with an amazing belt in “On Monday”; Rienstra provided a hilariously deadpan rendition of “Caralee”; Sweeney gave an incredibly intimate performance of “The Party Goes With You”; Binney inspired with the rousing number “The Seraph”; and Cami delivered a powerful performance of “Good Lady.” The chemistry between the cast members was palpable during ensemble pieces and made for some extremely emotional moments during the romantic ballads, “Cut You a Piece” being a memorably heart-wrenching example.
The tight choreography also added greatly to the production, complementing the dynamism of the rock without detracting from the singing. Some particularly ingenious staging even had the actors mirror the photograph projected behind them, fusing the photography and the music together seamlessly. Dreier used the theater space well, providing some great mid-song entrances and exits from the back of the audience that kept the audience engaged.
The small pit orchestra, led by conductor Liz P. Kantor ’18, filled the theater with catchy rock melodies and rhythms, with driving guitar riffs, pounding drums, and some great keyboard sounds keeping the audience engaged throughout the 90-minute performance. In some of the transitions and more intimate moments, the limited group of musicians lacked the power of a full orchestra, and the musicians occasionally overpowered the singers during the more upbeat songs, but overall the orchestra infused the production with an infectious sense of fun reminiscent of the music of “Rent” or “Spring Awakening.”
“35mm” rocketed between tenderness and explosion, with the intimate setting of the Adams Pool Theater adding to quieter moments perfectly and the enthusiasm of the cast and orchestra driving the powerful rock anthems all the way to the last row of the theater. The experimental integration of photography paid off, too, fusing with catchy tunes to make a great aural and visual experience. The production clearly showcased the best of Harvard’s musical and theatrical talent, providing an unforgettable thrill ride to boot.

UPDATED: October 16, 2016, at 10:32 p.m.
Cambridge Police officers arrested 11 people Friday who were blocking traffic in protest of recent labor negotiations between Harvard and its dining services workers.
The 11 people sat in a circle at the intersection of JFK Street and Massachusetts Avenue, blocking traffic, as roughly 100 other people chanting brandishing signs in support of the union lined the streets. After more than 20 minutes of demonstration and chanting about the negotiations, police officers arrested labor organizers and Harvard University Dining Services workers. Those arrested will be charged with disorderly conduct and put up for bail immediately, according to CPD Deputy Superintendent Steven DeMarco.
Two of those arrested were the president and lead negotiator of the Boston-based union representing dining workers, UNITE HERE Local 26—Brian Lang and Michael Kramer.
Those arrested were released Friday evening, according to Local 26's Facebook page, and they will appear in court Monday.
CPD and the demonstrators discussed the strike and arrests ahead of time, according to DeMarco.
“We had an group of officers that were designated, that were making announcements to clear the street, and we already knew they wouldn't adhere to the order,” DeMarco said. “The officers were ordered to pick them off the street. They were really compliant.”
Other supporters of the strike interrupted a joint reunion event for the Classes of 1971, 1976, and 1986 where University President Drew G. Faust was speaking Friday afternoon in Science Center lecture hall B. An alumnus, Jonathan K. Walters ’71, helped two students—Gabe G. Hodgkin ’18 and Grace F. Evans ’19—into the meeting, and around a dozen HUDS supporters followed them. The students said they chanted “support the strike.” Members of the Harvard University Police Department escorted them out.
As she left the alumni event in the Science Center, Faust said that the meeting was “a great exchange with alumni.”
When asked about the protesters, Faust said: “They expressed themselves.”
The demonstrations marked the latest development in a nearly two-weeks long strike of Harvard’s dining services workers. The historic walkout came after months of tense negotiations with the University over wages and health benefits failed to achieve a new contract.
The protests at the Science Center and in Harvard Square occurred simultaneously. On Mass. Ave. around 3:45 p.m. Friday, police carrying twist-tie handcuffs approached the circle of people and escorted them away from the intersection. The officers cuffed the workers one-by-one and led them to police vehicles, as onlookers and other striking employees shouted “Shame on you, Harvard” and “No justice, no peace” from the sidelines. The workers are being held at the CPD on a bail of “about $25 to $40,” DeMarco estimated.
Around the same time, members of the Student Labor Action Movement entered an alumni meeting in Science Center B, shouting “Support the Strike” as HUPD officers cut them off amidst brief physical contact.
As the demonstration in Harvard Square broke up following the arrests, protesters marched to the Yard, where they joined others on the Science Center Plaza. There, protesters marched in circles and heard brief speeches from a union member and student from the School of Public Health.
Then, about 30 undergraduates and Law School students lined the entrance to Science Center B, asking alumni to support the strike after the event.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also attended Friday afternoon’s alumni event, and passed through a path lined by protesters as he departed.
He was not available for comment Friday evening.
According to Hodgkin, a member of the College’s Student Labor Action Movement, the student demonstrators were well-received by alumni, adding that he thought alumni were mostly “enthusiastic” about their presence in the building.

Five years ago yesterday, Parks and Rec introduced us to the greatest holiday of the year: Treat Yo Self Day. Having just consumed two cupcakes and four slices of pizza while wearing gym clothes despite not stepping foot in the gym, I'm here to tell you what you can do to make sure you #treatyoself to the fullest.
First, don't set an alarm clock. How many times have you gone to bed as the sun was rising and still gone to your nine o'clock? Today, don't do that to yourself. Sleep until you're ready to wake up, even if it means skipping a class or two.
Second, eat to your heart's content. We all know that you don't wanna eat that salad. So don't! Dining halls throughout campus have been offering the most delectable and diverse meal and dessert options in the past several days, so help yourself to some of those. If that, for whatever reason, doesn't satisfy you, splurge on a pastry from Tatte or a hot chocolate from Burdicks.
Third, do not, under any circumstances, go to the gym. Do you truly enjoy sweating and panting and exerting so much energy? Is working out a fun experience? If you answered yes to either question, you're incorrect. Give yourself a day off. You can make up for the lost gainz another day.
Finally, avoid doing homework at all costs. If you have a pset or paper due tomorrow, ask for an extension. Your professors would without a doubt be understanding if you told them you couldn't get your work done as you're observing such an important holiday. In the time you'd spend grinding on work, go out with friends or be a hermit in your room watching Netflix– whatever makes you most content.
