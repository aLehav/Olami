After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year removed from the first season that saw Harvard fail to win at least a share of the Ivy League title for the first time since 2010, the Crimson enter its conference slate nearly unrecognizable from the squad that went 6-8 in the Ivy League just a year ago.
Entering its first conference matchup of the season, against Dartmouth, Harvard (6-5) is led by a combination of young and veteran talent—its two leading scorers come in the form of freshman Bryce Aiken and classmate Seth Towns. Aiken comes in averaging nearly 15 points a game while Towns has added 12 points per contest.
While the two have anchored the Crimson on offense, much of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s offense still runs through senior point guard Siyani Chambers. Through 11 games, the Minnesota native has averaged 6.8 assists per game, good for seventh-best in the nation.
Despite Chambers manning the floor for the Crimson, Harvard will still likely turn to the freshman class as a whole to score. In its matchup against Vermont last week, the Crimson’s rookies combined for 56 of Harvard’s 71 points. Before that, playing against Howard, the Crimson’s freshman went for 48 of Harvard’s 67. In total, every one of the Crimson’s freshmen has seen the floor this season, with five of the seven averaging over 15 minutes a game.
“It’s understanding that this is what it’s going to be like in the league and having that mentality,” said co-captain Corbin Miller after a grind-it-out win against Fordham. “The key, this year with some of the young guys too, is just understanding how the college game works.”
As Harvard squares off against the Big Green (3-10), it will be a facing off against a squad that is perhaps a bit more seasoned.
While Dartmouth brought in six freshmen this year, none start or see significant playing time for first-year coach David McLaughlin. Instead the Big Green has looked to sophomores Evan Boudreaux and Guilien Smith, who have combined to average 28.6 points per game.
Despite the standout performances from the two sophomores, Dartmouth comes into tonight’s matchup having struggled in non-conference play. The Big Green lost its first nine games to kick off the season before a win at LIU Brooklyn on December 18th. Since then, Dartmouth is are 2-1 and coming off a loss to Cal State Bakersfield.
The Crimson for its part has seen mixed results in its non-conference slate. At one point 1-4, Harvard won five in a row including wins against Boston College and Houston. The Crimson last saw action on January 2nd in an 82-71 loss to Vermont. While it couldn’t pull the late upset, Harvard had five players in double figures for the first time this season.
Dartmouth comes into the matchup averaging just over 66 points per game while allowing its opponents to score 73. The Crimson, for its part, comes in averaging 69 while allowing nearly 66.
In most of its losses, and on display last week against Vermont, the difference for Harvard has been its defense. In its loss to the Catamounts, the Crimson was outrebounded, 34-21, and 15- 5 on the offensive end.
While the Crimson has gone hot and cold on defense, senior Zena Edosomwan’s presence in the paint will be key to the outcome against Dartmouth. In games in which he collects seven or more rebounds, Harvard is 3-1. Coming into tonight’s matchup, Boudreaux leads the Big Green with nine rebounds per game. Ultimately Edosomwan’s presence in the paint will be key to holding off Dartmouth on the inside.
“Guys are definitely growing, getting better, getting more experience,” said Edosomwan following the Fordham game. “Hopefully we can keep progressing and getting things done.”
Notably new to the Ivy League this season, however, will be a conference tournament. While in years past a nearly unblemished record was the key to dancing come March, a four-team conference tournament will decide the winner of the Ivy League for the first time in history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, NH—Ivy League play has started, and this year, the Harvard men’s basketball team is ready.
Last season when the Crimson traveled to Dartmouth to face its travel partner, it was a much different team. Missing senior co-captain Siyani Chambers to injury and without the prowess of this year’s freshmen, head coach Tommy Amaker’s team lost to the Big Green, 63-50.
But this year was different. In its Ancient Eight opener, the Crimson (7-4) flashed its defensive prowess with a balanced offensive performance to defeat Dartmouth (3-11) with a 74-58 victory.
Harvard was once again led by a pair of freshmen, but not the typical freshmen. Though rookies Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns have been the team’s leading scorers over the past few weeks, it was classmates Chris Lewis and Justin Bassey who led the team with 14 points apiece Saturday night. Aiken and Towns, on the other hand, had just three apiece.
“That’s the difference of having the bench for us,” Amaker said. “Given different production from different players to make up for things. We’re very hopeful that we’re going to be a team that when one or two guys have a tough night that we’re going to be able to pick that up and maybe even expand.”
Not only did Bassey lead the team on the stat sheet, but he was a key cog in a 10-0 run that gave Harvard breathing room when they found themselves down four past the halfway mark in the first frame.
The Denver, Colo. native started the spree with a baseline triple assisted by Chambers. Just over a minute later after junior forward Chris Egi failed to complete a three-point play, Bassey secured the rebound off the free throw, which eventually reached freshman Robert Baker for a corner three banked off the backboard to put the team up 24-18.
Despite the 10 unanswered points, it only took one shot for Miles Wright to pull his team back within one possession as he hit a three with 4:57 to play in the first half. While Harvard would eventually get the gap up to 12 in the frame, the Big Green got it down to seven as the clock expired.
Lewis, on the other hand, made his presence known on the offensive end in the second half. While the Crimson outscored the Big Green 14-8 in the paint in the first half, they exploded for 26 inside points in the second frame, compared to just 10 for Dartmouth. Lewis had 10 of his 14 in the second period, and shot 7-of-8 overall from the floor in the game. The rookie currently leads the Ivy League in field goal percentage.
Amaker credited wearing down the defense with his fresh legs from the bench as a key contributor to the open looks his team found in the second half. This was particularly seen with Dartmouth’s reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Evan Boudreaux. Boudreaux put up strong numbers with 15 points and 14 rebounds, but was inefficient, shooting only 4-of-13 from the floor.
“We were able to have...timely efforts out of different players that came in and gave us minutes,” Amaker said. “I thought they really made the difference in wearing them down and getting so fatigued there.”
Though Harvard pushed the lead to 15 on multiple occasions, the Big Green never folded. With 4:34 remaining in the game, Dartmouth got the difference down to nine off of a pair of free throws from Boudreaux, but sophomore guard Corey Johnson responded with a layup on the other end to push the lead back to double digits and keep it there for good.
Dartmouth did not have a field goal in the last 5:39, following a Boudreaux triple, which Johnson erased with one of his own on the other end.
“Being on the road you really have to stick together,” Chambers said. “There’s going to be some ebbs and flows to the game, there’s going to be high points and low points and through it all we have to stay together and just trust each other and trust the system and trust our coaches and trust what got us here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dating back to February 2009, 18 of the last 19 meetings between the Harvard and Princeton men’s hockey teams have been one-goal affairs—if not closer—in the third period.
Saturday night's contest was just the latest example. Rebounding from a brutal 5-0 loss to Dartmouth in their 2017 opener the night before, the Tigers gave the No. 4/3 Crimson a battle at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, pulling even with the high-powered hosts a little more than three minutes into the final frame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 8, 2016, at 10:08 a.m.
Dating back to February 2009, 18 of the last 19 meetings between the Harvard and Princeton men’s hockey teams have been one-goal affairs—if not closer—in the third period.
Saturday night's contest was just the latest example. Rebounding from a brutal 5-0 loss to Dartmouth in their 2017 opener the night before, the Tigers gave the No. 4/3 Crimson a battle at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, pulling even with the high-powered hosts a little more than three minutes into the final frame.
Yet for the second time this season against the Orange and Black, a Harvard co-captain delivered the difference-maker. Two months after Devin Tringale’s third-period breakthrough gave the Crimson an edge in the teams’ first meeting, Alexander Kerfoot’s wrister from the center of the point broke a 2-2 tie with 15:48 left to play. Junior goaltender Merrick Madsen subsequently stopped all 11 shots he saw the rest of the way, and two empty-netters in the last minute of action inflated the final scoreline to 5-2 in favor of the hosts.
Harvard’s offense was buzzing all night long, generating a whopping 51 shots on goal. That marks the highest output for the Crimson (11-2-1, 7-1-1 ECAC) since a 2014 contest against none other than the Tigers and  netminder Colton Phinney, who made a career-high 51 saves as a rookie then and 46 more on Saturday.
Phinney opened the game a perfect 30-for-30 between the pipes this time around, allowing Princeton (7-10-1, 3-8-1) to open up a 1-0 lead in the second period despite Harvard’s high volume of shots. Nonetheless, in the latter stages of the same frame, the game finally flipped.
Capitalizing on a turnover by Tiger captain Ryan Siiro, senior Luke Esposito worked his way from the left faceoff dot to the inner edge of the circle before dishing off a pass to junior Jake Horton down low. Horton immediately turned and fired, sending the puck off the right skate of Princeton’s Quin Pompi and into the net—mirroring the Tigers’ first goal which bounced in off of sophomore defenseman Jacob Olson.
“I don’t feel like we had the energy at a level that we usually have until we scored our first goal, and I think it kind of gave the bench a little life,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Then I thought we started winning more 1-on-1 battles and races to the puck.”
Less than a minute later, a holding penalty called against Princeton forward David Hallisey inhibited the Tigers’ ability to regroup. Just 18 seconds into the power play, freshman defenseman Adam Fox’s laser from the point beat a screen and found the top left corner, suddenly giving the Crimson its first lead of the night.
“I wish Fox had too many beers two nights ago so he couldn’t play,” Princeton coach Ron Fogarty said. “He’s a really good hockey player.”
Fox of course played in the World Junior Championships for Team USA, who defeated Russia and Canada on Wednesday and Thursday to capture gold in Montreal. But that didn’t stop Fox from suiting up for both Harvard games this weekend, as the freshman logged three points across his third and fourth games in as many days.
Fogarty called Fox’s strike from the man advantage the turning point in the game. Nonetheless, Princeton did become the first team in six tries not to surrender multiple power-play goals to the Crimson. After earning seven power-play opportunities against Quinnipiac on Friday, Harvard managed just four against the Tigers, and the visitors held their own on the first three.
“They play a fast game, and they end up not taking a lot of penalties...because they’re not having to hack guys because they’re coming back so hard,” Madsen said. “It takes the special teams out of it, so when you end up playing those guys, you know that you’re going to have to step up and really play a man’s game.”
The game may have turned on Fox’s goal, but it remained very much up for grabs in the third period, especially after Princeton pulled back into a tie at 3:02. Freshman center Jackson Cressey collected a drop-pass in the slot from December’s ECAC Player of the Month, Max Veronneau, and beat Madsen stick-side to make it 2-2.
But Kerfoot’s response from just inside the blue line followed practically a minute later. With two points on the night, the center from West Vancouver now has over 100 for his career. He ranks third in the country in points per game (1.71) and second—only to Fox—in assists per game (1.21).
Madsen held tough the rest of the way, notching his second game of the weekend with 30-plus saves—this one against a team that earned wins in seven of its final nine games of 2016, going 5-2 against ranked opponents over that span.
“They had two or three very scary opportunities that he made look pretty easy,” Donato said. “Merrick had a great weekend. It looks like a lot of the hard work he’s put in is paying off.”
At 19:00, junior Seb Lloyd notched an empty-net goal—something he probably could have had on Friday as well if he hadn’t given away his chance to freshman Nathan Krusko, who at the time was one goal away from a hat trick. Sophomore Ryan Donato added another with three seconds remaining.
Since Union was out of action this weekend, Harvard has now pulled to within two points of the ECAC frontrunner with one game still in hand. The two contenders will square off in Schenectady, New York, this Saturday.

GAME NOTES
—Harvard now sits second in the PairWise rankings, which typically predict the NCAA tournament field with great accuracy.
—Thanks to the Crimson's two empty-netters, Harvard moved into first in the country in goals per game (4.57). The Crimson just barely passed Penn State, who sits comfortably in second (4.53).
—Harvard took just two penalties on Saturday and killed both of them.
—Having played games on four consecutive nights, Adam Fox said that he now plans to take a couple days off to "try to recover emotionally and physically" from the World Junior Championships.
"Obviously it's a stressful time—the tournament," Fox said. "It's high intensity. It really tires you out. You're so focused in there, and then having to come back here and stay in the zone and keep the focus is definitely something that was kind of tough. But I kind of had to fight through it, I had to do it, so to take a couple days off here will be really big."
