After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jazz pianist Billy Childs, vocalists Becca Stevens and Alicia Olatuja, and the Parker Quartet collaborated in a musical reinterpretation of the work of sixties singer-songwriter Laura Nyro in Sanders Theatre on Friday night. In this performance of songs from his Grammy Award-winning tribute to Nyro, Childs engaged not only with the diverse musicians on the stage but also with diverse musical traditions. Rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel, and folk mingled and played off each other, while scraps of sung poetry and improvisatory solos on the piano, drums, and saxophone rose from and then subsided back into the swell of the music. The musicians traded glances and appreciative nods onstage, listening to each other and answering back with sound. The performance became a kind of conversation—but one in which most of the dialogue happened without words.
The ensemble’s sound reflected the wide musical vocabulary of Nyro herself, who began writing songs in her teens and produced her greatest hits in the late sixties with songs like “Stoned Soul Picnic,” “New York Tendaberry,” and “Save the Country.” She grew up listening not only to Smokey Robinson and Nina Simone but also to her mother’s Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy records. “I’m not interested in conventional limitations when it comes to my songwriting. For instance, I may bring a certain feminist perspective to my songwriting, because that’s how I see life. I’m interested in art, poetry, and music,” Nyro once said. “As that kind of artist, I can do anything,”. Her lyrics range from intensely personal reflections on motherhood and childhood memories to social commentary on war, poverty, and urban life.

Billy Childs, a jazz pianist who has so far won four Grammy Awards and who began performing publicly at the age of six, says he was introduced to Nyro’s work in his childhood by his older sister. Between his first encounter with her music at the age of eleven and the release of his 2014 tribute album, “Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro,” Childs trained as a pianist and a composer. He became prominent in the eighties as a performer in the Los Angeles jazz community and received commissions for orchestral compositions from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
In this performance, Childs collaborated with the Harvard Music Department’s current Blodgett Artists-in-Residence, the Parker Quartet. The string quartet’s members trained together at the New England Conservatory of Music and have been part of the teaching faculty at Harvard since the fall of 2014.
Daniel T. Chong, one of the quartet’s violinists, said that the music for Friday’s concert took the ensemble outside of its usual repertoire and performance style. “The most challenging part has been that as a string quartet we play with the same three people ninety-percent of the time, and this is quite a big collaboration. It’s a matter of fitting into someone else’s band,” he said. “And the addition of a different genre of music has been challenging and rewarding at the same time.” According to Chong, even the quartet’s instruments took on a new character on Friday. “Since we’re an acoustic ensemble, being amped and playing with electric instruments is really a different ball game,” he said. “So how we listen to our sound and how the audience is experiencing our sound is what’s different, even more than how we’re actually playing.”

Chong added that the quartet’s members, though usually performers of pieces from the classical repertoire, have long been admirers of Childs’ music. “It’s in some ways very different from what we do, but in many ways it’s very similar to what we do because in the end we’re all performers and we’re all trying to communicate the music with as much impact as possible,” he said.
Of the songs the ensemble performed on Friday, Chong said that the one that he feels most drawn to is “Been on a Train,” Nyro’s fiercely melancholy description of a man’s death by drug overdose. “There’s something about that song that always hits me, that always reminds me that music is incredibly powerful,” he said. For him, as for Childs, Nyro’s music remains part of an ongoing conversation about what music can express.

To the editor:
As a Jewish alumnus of Harvard Law School, I am compelled to speak up about the current debate regarding the symbolic connection to slavery of the Harvard Law School seal and the Mather House name.
If Harvard had places called "Hitler Hall" and "Mengele Meadows," how would I and other Jewish members of the Harvard community react?
Can someone explain to me why the present situation is different?  President Faust?  Dean Minow?  Anyone?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every two minutes, someone is sexually assaulted in the United States. One out of every six American women and three percent of American men have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape. Yet most instances of sexual assault are not reported, and the vast majority of offenders do not face prosecution or prison. In short, sexual assault is an under-addressed problem of undeniable scope and gravity.
A bill currently before the Massachusetts state legislature would help combat this epidemic. The legislation, drafted in part by several Harvard students, would establish a statewide bill of rights for victims of sexual assault and make resources like counseling and rape kits more accessible across the Commonwealth.
Standing with those who have endorsed the bill, including former attorney general Martha Coakley, we wholeheartedly support this legislation. Its provisions lay out practical and much-needed reforms to combat the many inadequacies in the handling of sexual assault cases.
Rape kits, which preserve and document evidence after an assault, are chronically underused. A USA Today-led study found 70,000 untested rape kits in over 1,000 police jurisdictions nationwide, suggesting a far larger problem. This backlog reflects an unwillingness among some law enforcement agencies to prioritize sexual assault cases.
The Massachusetts bill would combat this problem by outlining procedures for tracking rape kits, giving survivors access to those procedures, and ensuring that kits are tested before they are destroyed. Among other provisions, it would also provide much-needed counseling to survivors throughout the process. In a culture where sexual assault survivors are frequently accused of making false allegations and often criticized for their actions, these are essential measures that have the potential to improve reporting and prosecution rates.
When prosecution does occur, the court system must still ensure that it devotes adequate resources to the pursuit of the justice. Unfortunately, a 2014 study by the Massachusetts Bar Association found that both public defenders and assistant district attorneys in the Commonwealth make pitifully low salaries. While these concerns are outside the scope of the legislation currently under consideration, the legislature must remember that those sexual assault cases that end in court will suffer from these funding inequities. Both accused and accuser deserve the benefit of full-throated and well-funded legal representation. When it comes to helping sexual assault survivors explore their options and begin to seek justice, however, this bill does a superb job.
Even beyond the details of the proposed law, the process that led to its drafting—involving the input of several Harvard students—is an excellent example of how activism within and outside of the academy can complement one another. We applaud the Harvard students, other activists, and lawmakers involved in drafting this legislation, and we urge Massachusetts legislators to pass it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A minority group on campus claims they are marginalized, underrepresented, stereotyped and institutionally “silenced.”
Here’s the reaction you’d expect:
“Whine, whine, whine, whine,” mocks the conservative. “Next thing you know, they’ll petition to preface the first amendment of the Constitution with a trigger warning.”
“We must,” screams the liberal, “engage with, acknowledge, affirm, validate, recognize, legitimize, and stand alongside our marginalized, underserved, underrepresented, persecuted, silenced, exploited, suppressed, oppressed, and repressed fellow students in a coalition of trust, assurance, compassion, empathy, and mutual understanding to combat the broadly systematic and institutional norms that oppress them!”
But there is one exception to this pattern, which causes a strikingly odd role-reversal. Namely, conservatives on campus occasionally whine about their own marginalization. And, when they do, empowered liberals are the ones rolling their eyes.
It’s no secret that conservatives are underrepresented at Harvard. Just 12.2 percent of the respondents in the Class of 2019 survey identified as somewhat conservative or very conservative. Partly as a result of their minority status, conservatives often report that they repress their views in class or in the dining hall for fear of facing anger and exclusion among peers. Moreover, because about 96 percent of campaign contributions from Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates go to liberal political campaigns (by one estimate), conservative students have voiced fears of grading biases against them.
Furthermore, conservatives have faced clear instances of institutional hostility toward their views. For instance, in one Harvard freshman orientation program, group leaders used signs that read “Honk if you hate Reagan!” to welcome new freshman. In addition, last winter, a Harvard office supposedly geared towards “Diversity and Inclusion” put out placemats that basically said, “Your conservative family is misinformed. Here’s how to lecture the people who raised you.”
Let’s recap: We have underrepresentation and institutional prejudices. So what has the liberal response been so far?
“Whine, whine, whine, whine,” groan the liberals. In my experience, my fellow liberals on campus usually react with apathy and annoyance. One friend even made a Facebook post on the topic accompanied by an image of Mr. Crabs from SpongeBob playing the world’s smallest violin.
For their part, conservatives haven’t been too hypocritical about the whole thing. They mostly say that the onus is on the conservatives to create more dialogue and improve their own situation.
Unfortunately, I think it’s my fellow liberals who are the ones being hypocritical this time.
Liberals give reasons for their uncharacteristic lack of sympathy. Conservatism, they say, uses racism, homophobia, nativism, patriarchy, and classism to forward the interests of the powerful at the expense of the underprivileged. They say we should be numb to complaints of marginalization from those who aim to marginalize others.
But we must understand that the conservatives on campus are not the xenophobic fringe-conservatives who explicitly aim to marginalize groups to “Make America Great Again.”  In fact, a majority of Harvard conservatives identify as socially liberal. For instance, a significant majority of conservatives among the Class of 2014 favored same-sex marriages. And conservatives from the Class of 2015 tended to favor Republican candidates with relatively progressive stances on issues like immigration. Even among the more conservative of them, Harvard Republicans generally seem willing to tackle many of the same issues as liberal students—they just usually prefer less government intervention.
Furthermore, Harvard conservatives do not uniformly come from socially powerful backgrounds. Conservatives among the Class of 2019 were spread pretty evenly across family income brackets, and only about 20 percent of the highest bracket identified as conservative. In addition, the proportion of students who identified as conservative among Whites was about the same as the proportion among Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Native Alaskan students.
Conservatives on campus are not uniformly self-interested white boys who prance through final clubs on trust fund money. For the most part, they are a group of students from a variety of backgrounds who have different ideas about tackling the same issues that most liberal students on campus want to tackle.
I can see why liberals would roll their eyes at a billionaire presidential candidate who complains that “political correctness” unnecessarily stifles his ability to bash American Muslims. But I can’t see why we roll our eyes at our classmates, housemates, and friends who feel they must keep silent in their dining halls lest their peers or placemats make unfair assumptions about their views. It’s unfair. And, by leaving us less prepared to face diverse viewpoints beyond these gates, it hurts us as much as it hurts them.
So let’s start with conversations. We must not only hear the views of our conservative peers but also listen to them. When we criticize, we must make sure it is a criticism of ideas rather than character. By holding our speech and actions to a certain standard of respect, we must create a space that is both safe and intellectually stimulating for everyone involved. While problems like underrepresentation may be difficult to fully resolve, we can do our part as liberal students to make our peers feel more comfortable and respected on campus.
There’s an elephant in the room. Let’s make sure we treat it like the empathetic donkeys we are, rather than like asses.

During my first few days at Harvard, I attended the Advising Fair and wandered into the language section. Thinking I might be interested in Sanskrit, I approached the Classical Languages booth for advice. I was surprised and confused to instead be redirected to the South Asian Studies booth.
Before that moment, I had never actively thought about the qualities of classical languages, nor had I ever truly considered the definition of a classical language. Growing up, as the daughter of Indian immigrants, I had always considered Sanskrit to be a classical language. It only felt like a natural assumption, especially considering that Sanskrit, along with Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Odia, are officially considered classical languages in India.
Although the question of which department a language is taught in might seem trivial to some, I take issue with the exclusion of Sanskrit from Harvard's Department of the Classics for two major reasons.
First, in only including European languages—Greek and Latin—the department's choices reinforce Eurocentrism and prioritize Western culture. The opening line of the description of classical languages in the Languages at Harvard booklet reads “Greek and Latin provide access to the two cultures and literatures that have profoundly influenced the development of Western civilization,” conflating “classical” and “Western civilization.” However, “classical” also refers to the foundations of many cultures outside of Europe that Harvard doesn’t acknowledge in the current study of classical languages. Overlooking non-European classical languages is overlooking those societies on the global stage and the role of their cultures and literatures in the development of civilizations around the world.
Secondly, a classical languages department that contains only Greek and Latin contradicts accepted scholarly definitions of what constitutes a classical language. In an essay advocating that Tamil also be considered a classical language, George L. Hart, Professor Emeritus of Tamil at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote that a classical language “should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.”
In a similar vein, Tom McArthur, who served as editor of English Today for 23 years, defined a classical language as follows: “A prestigious, often ancient language, such as Latin or Sanskrit, or a variety of a language, such as classical Greek…. They have traditionally provided models for successor or dependent languages, especially for styles of verse and prose, literary genres, grammatical descriptions, pronouncements on usage, and philosophical and other texts.”
By these formal definitions, there is little doubt that Sanskrit should be considered a “classical language” in linguistic studies. Sanskrit has influenced the vocabulary of languages such as Bengali, Nepali, Konkani, Assamese, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu. Sanskrit produced an abundant body of literature including the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, which are still well known today. Today, scientific innovations and administrative terms often come from Sanskrit, a similar phenomenon to Greek and Latin's influence on medical or scientific terms in western culture.
In addition, Edward Sapir, who was an anthropologist and professor at the University of Chicago and later Yale University, identified classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Arabic, Greek and Latin as having “an overwhelming significance as carriers of culture.” In short, it is not just Sanskrit that is excluded from Harvard's designation of classical language. By this definition, those five languages should comprise the classical languages department in Harvard.
In offering a wealth of foreign languages, Harvard has clearly demonstrated its commitment to providing students with a global perspective. However, an exclusively European Department of Classics neglects the global, long lasting contributions of non-European classical societies. In order to align more with scholarly definitions of “classical languages” such as Sapir's and amend a Western bias, Harvard should include all five classical languages in the department. These languages are already taught at Harvard under different departments, making this restructuring possible without having to seek out and hire new professors.
A potential criticism of this change is that it creates a disjointed department with unrelated languages. Although most universities define only Greek and Latin as classical languages, not all do. Under “Classical Languages,” Lebanon Valley College offers elementary Classical Greek, Latin and Sanskrit; the Classics department at Brown University offers courses in Ancient and Modern Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit language and literature. As these institutions show, it is possible to create a cohesive department with the inclusion of non-European languages.
In setting only Greek and Latin apart with the status of “classical language,” Harvard overlooks Arabic, classical Chinese, and Sanskrit, among others, as having significantly contributed to classical societies. If rearranging courses within departments doesn’t seem to be a feasible option, then Harvard should at least re-name the department to more accurately reflect its focus, because “classical” most certainly does not mean just Western.

Twenty seniors are currently working on creative theses—double the number of students who wrote them in 2013, according to the English department’s undergraduate program administrator, Lauren Bimmler.
While the application and prerequisites for a creative thesis have changed little, the addition of journalism and screenplay writing class offerings has created new opportunities for more varied theses in creative writing. 
The creative writing thesis is an opportunity for students to work closely with professional writers to produce a substantial creative work, and in recent years, the number of students writing creative theses has been growing. 
English concentrator and creative thesis writer Kelley Guinn McArtor ’16 credited the increased interest in writing a creative thesis both to these new offerings and to the incorporation of creative assignments in classes outside of the English department.
“I think it’s a result of an increase in creative workshops coupled with teachers encouraging students to pursue creative writing in other classes,” she said. “Each year, they seem to introduce more and more opportunities to write creatively.”
Faculty advisers in the program work closely with students starting in their junior year. Many students find the advising relationship both helpful and inspiring.
“It’s been interesting to hear directly from someone who has published works,” Dianisbeth M. Acquie ’16 said. “It makes me think about my own future.”
Advisers provide both feedback and support throughout the lengthy writing process. “As a thesis adviser, you are there to support their imagination, but the young writer needs to generate the work on their own,” Claire D. Messud, an English lecturer who teaches fiction, said.
English concentrators and joint-concentrators interested in writing theses must apply in the spring of their junior year by submitting a thesis proposal and writing samples for faculty review.
English lecturer and faculty adviser Sam W. Marks, commenting on the selection of thesis writers, said, “We chose primarily who we feel we can help the most and who is going to excel.”
Interested students must also have taken at least one creative writing course while at Harvard.
Some students said their experiences in creative workshops motivated their decision to write creative theses.
“I went through junior tutorial, and I thought I would write a critical thesis,” Acquie said. “But junior spring I took a creative writing class with Jamaica Kincaid, and I realized I wanted to do more storytelling.”
McArtor added that the number of opportunities to study creative writing at Harvard surprised her.
“I went into college thinking I would not have time to write my own poetry, let alone pursue a creative thesis,” McArtor said.

Students and alumni expressed concern for the potential shuttering of MBTA late night weekend service following last week’s public meeting at Cambridge City Hall.
In an effort to reduce the MBTA’s budget deficit, the regional public transit organization has introduced proposals to eliminate or privatize T service from 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. on weekends. Last week’s meeting was one of many public forums scheduled in and around Boston to discuss the proposal. 
The proposed changes would disproportionately affect the Harvard Square T stop more than other MBTA stations. An MBTA report from last February found Harvard Square was the 4th busiest station during late night hours.
Jessie J. King ’19, who uses the T frequently, praised the current late night service program.
“A lot of students use it as a more safe, cost efficient way to hang out with their friends on the weekends,” she said.
Ilian A. Meza ’17 said that when going out or traveling to concerts in Boston, taxis and ride-sharing services such as Uber were considerably more expensive than riding the MBTA.
“I don’t use the T that often, but when traveling to Boston the T was definitely more affordable,” Meza said.
Susan J. Ringler ’74, an advocate for late night weekend MBTA service, said the late night service is crucial, not only for the university population, but also for those from around the greater Boston area.
“I think it affects a lot of people in the University community,” she said, citing the potential difficulties cuts would create for those who work in Harvard Square. “This is not just a student population, it's about the backbone of our city.” 
Ringler said she was concerned the MBTA’s public meeting held on Jan. 20 addressing potential changes was hosted at an inopportune time. A large portion of the student population was still in transition back to their respective campuses, precluding them from voicing their opinions regarding the MBTA’s proposed cuts.
“They held these public meetings before all our students got back into town, they didn’t advertise them very well, and they presented a slide presentation that showed they had pretty much made up their minds that it was too expensive and they had to cut it,” Ringler said.
Dalen L. Ferreira ’19 also expressed skepticism at the proposed cuts’ ability to solve the MBTA’s monetary troubles.
“I think there would be much better ways to save money,” he said.

A recent leadership change in the membership of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, a neighborhood advisory body on issues related to Harvard’s development projects in Allston, has rekindled debate over the transparency of the group’s member selection process.
Six months ago, then-Chairman of the task force Raymond V. Mellone stepped down from the position to take care of his wife.
“I couldn’t spend the time away from her any longer so I had to give [the chairmanship] up,” Mellone said. “That’s just the way it is.”  
Formed in 2006, the task force acts as a channel for community feedback to Harvard and the Boston Redevelopment Authority regarding the University’s developments in the neighborhood. The BRA is Boston’s urban planning agency.
Mellone had served as chairman since the creation of the task force. His retirement left a vacancy in leadership, spurring discussion over whether or not the body should even have a chairman according to Gerald Autler, the BRA’s senior project manager. Eventually, task force member John A. Bruno agreed to serve as interim chair after being nominated by a peer on the committee.
The conversations about leadership structure revived a longstanding criticism of the task force’s method of member selection.
At the time of the task force’s inception in 2006, the BRA worked with the Boston Mayor’s Office and local elected officials to source nominations before the BRA director made final offers to candidates, according to Autler. Subsequent invitations have come from the BRA director, Autler said.
Paul “Chip” Alford, an Allston resident who frequently attends task force meetings, said he disagrees with this selection process. He added that he believes former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino directed that members of the task force be appointed by the mayor, not the BRA.
Autler, however, called the current selection process “standard practice for every other task force.”
Steps have recently been taken to remedy the conflict. Upon request, task force member Bruce E. Houghton wrote a proposal intended to bring “both clarity and transparency” to the selection process and presented it to the Mayor’s Office and the BRA.
The proposal, submitted roughly six months ago, has yet to receive approval, Houghton said.
Alford said he and a few other Allston residents had sent a separate letter of complaint to the Mayor’s Office, asking Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh to clarify the task force’s appointment process. On Dec. 21, Alford and two others met with Jerome Smith, the director of Boston’s Office of Neighborhood Services, to discuss the situation. According to Alford, neither Walsh nor Smith has responded back to him.
The disagreement over the selection method stems from a fundamental difference in opinion over the scope of the BRA’s role in community relations. Autler said he believes the BRA should play a key role in the administration of the task force, which is intended to serve in an advisory capacity to the agency.
Alford said he thinks the BRA has taken its administrative role too far.
“This kind of stuff makes me crazy, where the BRA is stepping in and taking the reins of a community process,” Alford said. “It doesn’t feel right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Responding to recent campus protests, newly elected Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 said the Council’s goals this semester will include repurposing a $30,000 grant, increasing administrative oversight of final clubs, and bolstering sexual assault prevention and mental health initiatives.
In an interview Wednesday, Rather and Banks, who campaigned on a platform dubbed “Open Harvard,” detailed their platform for the coming year. Rather and Banks assumed the presidency and vice presidency late last semester after winning a plurality of votes in a UC presidential election with the lowest turnout since 2011.
One of their first objectives is to reform the UC’s $30,000 Bridging and Belonging grant, which Council leaders acquired from the College in 2014 after a failed attempt to request $250,000 in additional funding. Although the grant is designed to fund events between student groups, Rather said it is underutilized.
“Looking back, a lot of our executive members feel it wasn’t utilized that well,” Rather said. “Students didn’t know about it, and there was a lot of hesitation about the fund.”
Rather and Banks said they hope to repurpose the grant by publicizing the funds to student leaders. They also will consider loosening application requirements for funding from the UC’s Finance Committee, a body that allocates about $300,000 to student extracurriculars and events.
“We want to empower students, so that they know what this money is for, and any idea that they have now has a venue to get funded,” Rather said.
Rather and Banks said they also plan to tackle issues around sexual assault prevention and final clubs in light of recent student protests and the University’s sexual assault survey data. They will meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana next week, where they plan to gauge his response on their platform, Rather said.
“The UC President and Vice President are the chief advocates for the entire student body,” Banks said. “We want to bring the voices of students to the table.”
While Banks stressed the importance of representing members of final clubs during talks with administrators, he argued that administrators must hold the unrecognized groups accountable on gender-related issues. Administrators have recently pressured male final clubs into admitting women and publicly criticized the groups for alleged exclusivity.
“Harvard has a huge amount of power over final clubs because all of their members are students here,” Banks said. “We want to make sure they’re being responsible,” he added, referring to undergraduates in final clubs.
Within the Council itself, Rather and Banks said they hope to unify the UC’s seven committees under the goals the pair presented during the campaign, including mental health and freshman programming.
“Our committee chairs have taken pieces of our platform that they feel really passionate about and are starting conversations,” Rather said.
Rather and Banks also plan to switch the location of UC meetings throughout the semester. Last year, all UC meetings were held in Harvard Hall. By rotating rooms, the pair said, they hope more undergraduates who are not on the UC will attend the meetings, which are open to all students. 
Recent campus protests and debates around final clubs, race relations, sexual assault, and mental health have shaped their goals, Rather and Banks said.
“The time period in which we ran and in which we will serve is unbelievably different than when Ava and Dhruv took office,” Rather said, referring to last year’s UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16. “That has shaped our entire platform and our goals for this year.”

Harvard Medical School does not have a diverse enough student and faculty body, a group of Medical School students is charging in a petition they plan to deliver to University President Drew G. Faust.
Around 300 people have signed the petition, which calls on Faust to select a new Medical School dean committed to increasing the school’s diversity. The petition comes during the search for a dean to replace  Jeffrey S. Flier, who announced in December he would step down from his position at the helm of the Medical School this summer. 

A group called the “Racial Justice Coalition”—composed of Medical School and Dental School affiliates—sponsored the petition, which they began circulating last Thursday, according to Nelson Malone, a Medical School student and one of the group’s leaders. The group plans to deliver the petition to Faust next week.
One of their demands is that at least a quarter of candidates interviewed for the position “come from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine.” The group also requests that the new dean “has demonstrated a commitment to social justice, as exemplified through actions and/or scholarship furthering health equity.”
“To truly dismantle systemic inequalities across our nation and world, we must also dismantle them at home,” the petition reads. “We need a leader committed to social justice both inside and outside our community.”
Provost Alan M. Garber ’76— who, along with Faust and 15 professors across Harvard, is leading the dean search—wrote in an emailed statement that he has met with some of the petition’s organizers and will consider their demands when selecting the dean. Garber wrote that Harvard considers a number of factors when choosing new deans.
Referring to the Medical School dean search, Garber wrote: “In this case, among the most important [qualities] are excellence in fostering medical education and biomedical research, and also ensuring that the HMS community both reflects and serves the needs of underrepresented minorities and others in our society who face inequalities and differential access to healthcare.”
Medical School student Helen H. Shang, who signed the petition, said the group’s efforts could raise awareness about minority representation at the school.
“The petition would be a really great starting point on increasing diversity in our class and the school overall, which I feel like would benefit not only us as physicians but just as people in general,” Shang said.
The movement at the Medical School comes as discussions of race and diversity dominate discourse across Harvard.  At the end of last semester, students at Harvard Law School issued a series of demands to their dean, Martha L. Minow, to improve the school’s treatment of minority students. And at the College, House masters unanimously decided in December to change their title, in part citing the racial implications of the term “Master.” They have yet to decide on a new title.
The petition is not the first step the Racial Justice Coalition has taken towards addressing diversity on Harvard’s Longwood campus. In November, students held meetings and demonstrations about the underrepresentation of minorities in medicine, Malone said.
In addition to increasing diversity at the school, the coalition is calling for more course offerings about socioeconomic status and race in health and medicine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After taking the top spot in 2014, Harvard fell to second in an annual ranking of universities by donations. In Fiscal Year 2015, Harvard received $1.05 billion in gifts, a number that does not include most of John Paulson’s $400 million gift to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences or Gerald Chan’s gift to the School of Public Health.
Stanford has led this ranking, compiled by the Council for Aid to Education, for nine of the last 10 years. This year, Stanford’s cash receipts totaled $1.63 billion, which includes four gifts of $100 million or more. The largest gifts came in the form of artwork from two branches of a San Francisco Bay Area family, with the two gifts valued at over $600 million.
Many gifts to Harvard—including those from Paulson and Chan as well as a donation to financial aid from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89— have been made as pledges of support to be fulfilled over an agreed number of years. Property gifts, in contrast, are transferred to the University in one fell swoop. The value of property gifts is included in the fiscal year calculations.
Harvard’s continued fundraising comes as part an unprecedented University-wide capital campaign with a target of $6.5 billion. The campaign, which publicly launched in September 2013, has raised over $6 billion as of September 2015. Since then, the University has remained mum on where it stands and Faust has said she has no plans to raise the campaign's target.
American colleges received a record-breaking $40.3 billion in FY 2015, according to the survey. In FY 2014, Harvard received $1.16 billion in gifts, a 45.9 percent increase over FY 2013. In FY 2014, Stanford accepted $928 million in gifts, just under its $1.035 billion total in 2013, when it became the first university in history to receive over $1 billion in gifts in a single year.
The Council for Aid to Education report documented an swell in the value of property, which includes real estate, artwork, books, and other tangible items, donated to universities in FY 2015, increasing 164.9 percent over FY 2014. After the art gift to Stanford, the next largest gift in this category of contributions was the Scheide family’s $300 million gift of rare books and manuscripts to Princeton.
Ann E. Kaplan, the director of the survey, said as the value of art has increased in recent years, an increasing number of private donors have chosen to donate their collections while the value is still high.
“If I had a collection that I did not plan on giving to my children, I would donate to a university now,” she said.
The survey does not register how much a university has raised purely based on pledged contributions.  Instead, it records the value of all assets, cash or property, a donor transfers over to a university within the given fiscal year.
Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development, wrote in a statement she looks forward to further gifts.
“We remain extremely grateful to our alumni and friends for their continued generosity, which has supported a host of mission-oriented initiatives, including cutting-edge research, new faculty positions and the financial aid necessary to keep Harvard affordable for all students,” Rogers wrote. “As we enter the second half of The Harvard Campaign, we look forward to further advancing our mission of research, education, and discovery, with their support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In what could end up being a season-defining slate of games, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team will welcome ECAC leaders No.4/4 Quinnipiac and No.9/9 Princeton to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this weekend, looking to reassert itself as one of the dominant teams in the ECAC and the nation.
The Crimson (11-7-1, 8-5-1 ECAC), currently located fifth in the conference, are currently six and two points behind the Bobcats (20-1-4, 10-1-3) and Tigers (16-4-1, 9-4-1), respectively. Sweeping the two teams would be a huge boost for a Harvard team that has struggled to find momentum recently and is currently outside the projected playoff field.
“This weekend is about proving to Quinnipiac and Princeton that we can beat them,” sophomore defender Chelsea Ziadie said. “It’s about proving to ourselves that we can beat anyone, no matter who our opponent is.”
The Crimson will face a tough task from its first game, as the team looks to hand a potent Quinnipiac squad only its second loss this season. Since dropping a 4-3 decision to Yale on Halloween, the Bobcats have rattled off 18 consecutive games without a loss—including a 2-1 overtime victory over Harvard at home.
A Crimson defense that has been shaky in front of goal will be tested with a dangerous goal-scorer in the shape of Bobcat forward Taylar Cianfrano, who is currently ranked fourth in goals in the nation with 22 tallies in 24 games.
Quinnipiac is also dangerous on the penalty—an area Harvard has struggled on this season—with the nation’s fourth highest power play conversion rate at 25 percent.
While the Crimson backline will face one of its toughest challenges this season, the team will head into the match with some much needed confidence and momentum after shutting out and breaking a three game losing streak against Dartmouth last weekend thanks to 23 saves from captain Emerance Maschmeyer.
“It’s huge,” senior forward Miye D’Oench said. “It’s never easy to break a losing streak. For Emerance to get the shutout and for the team to get the shutout, that was also a really big thing last weekend.”
On the other end, D’Oench will lead a Harvard front line that is averaging over two goals a game against one of the best defenses in the nation.
The Bobcat defense—which allows a mere average of 0.92 goals per game, second best in the nation—is led by junior netminder Sydney Rossman, who is ranked top-five in all major goaltending statistics and will likely be locked in a goaltending battle all night with her Crimson counterpart Maschmeyer.
In the latter half of the weekend, Harvard will face off against a Princeton team that has won eleven games in a row and is currently in the midst of a playoff hunt of its own.
For the second night in a row, Maschmeyer is likely to find herself in a battle with her counterpart, as Harvard will attempt to find the net against Tiger goalkeeper Kimberly Newell. The senior is currently tied with Maschmeyer in save percentage with a .947 save percentage—third best in the nation.
After losing tight road games to both teams earlier this year—dropping both results in overtime by a margin of 2-1—Harvard will need to run on all cylinders and minimize potential mistakes.
While miscues such as turnovers and penalties disrupted the Crimson’s play, the work put in by the team leading up to this week will go a long way in helping out Harvard’s chances of victory.
“We worked on a lot of support on the [defensive] zone,” Ziadie said. “Playing smart, playing hard, and doing the little things right. Just basic things that make a huge difference in the long run.”
Though the prospect of claiming victories against its conference foes is a daunting one, the Crimson will look to take advantage of these adjustments and its previous experience against the two teams to gain an upper hand at home and flip the script.
“We have a taste of what’s coming,” D’Oench said. “We know they’re going to give us their best and that’s going to be pretty good, we just have to be better… It’s nothing we haven’t seen before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team has bad memories of DeNunzio Pool. A little less than a year ago, the Crimson’s perfect season was dashed when the team fell to Princeton in the Tigers’ home pool to end up second at the 2015 Ivy League Championships.
This weekend, Harvard (8-0, 5-0 Ivy) will seek to erase the memory of last year’s disappointing finish when it returns to DeNunzio to take on Princeton (4-0, 4-0) and Yale (8-1, 4-1) in its final meet of the regular season. The stakes are high, as the Crimson enters the competition with an undefeated season and sole ownership of first place in the Ancient Eight standings on the line.
“Heading into HYP, the biggest goal is to perform to the best of our ability,” freshman Daniel Tran said.  “Overall, all we want to do is race and hopefully beat some of the biggest competition we have faced so far this year.”
Although the Tigers edged Harvard for the title at the Ivy Championships last year, the Crimson has not lost to either Princeton or Yale in the regular season since 2012, and Harvard will come into the weekend with significant momentum. The Crimson has been undefeated in the regular season since January 2014.
“Every season we have the goal of winning every dual meet, and we have been successful over the past three years by going undefeated in the Ivy League, so as a senior there is definitely a mentality that we would like to keep that streak alive,” co-captain Christian Yeager said.
Harvard’s success this season has been paced by a number of standout performances from individual athletes, such as sophomore David Pfeiffer, who has been dominant on the diving board. The Merrimack, N.H., native has finished inside the top three in both the 1-meter and 3-meter events eight times this season, including four wins.
The Crimson’s string of commanding solo performances has also manifested itself in the pool, where Tran has emerged as a leader for the team, capturing an individual victory in every meet this year.
However, these standout showings have served to highlight the depth that has propelled Harvard to the verge of a second consecutive undefeated season.
The Crimson’s range of talent is most evident in the relay events, including the 200 medley relay, where the team has tallied five wins this season with three different lineups. Nine different swimmers have garnered at least one win in the event for Harvard this year.
Despite the Crimson’s streak of successful results, it will face a formidable challenge in Princeton and Yale.
“We are definitely competing with the mentality of underdogs since we placed second at Ivy Champs last year,” Yeager said.
The Tigers, currently tied for first place in the Ivy League, have yet to drop a dual meet this season, and the team finished first at the Big Al Invitational in December.
Princeton’s run of commanding results has been driven by consistent performances from its veterans, most notably senior En-Wei Hu-Van Wright, who has led the team with a run of individual and relay victories.
Yale had a comparably quick start to its season, but dropped an Ivy League decision to Penn earlier this month to fall to second place in the conference standings. Despite the setback, the Bulldogs will take on Harvard and Princeton boasting an impressive record.
Yale’s underclassmen have emerged as some of the team’s strongest athletes, among them freshman Scott Bole and sophomore Kei Hyogo. Bole burst onto the scene this year with a series of first-place finishes in the 100 butterfly and 200 freestyle, and Hyogo has established himself as one of the league’s strongest swimmers in the 400 IM and 200 butterfly.
The tri-meet carries extra significance, as it is the final chance for the Crimson to build momentum before it enters the championship portion of its season.
“This meet should be a really good indicator of how the Ivy Champs should turn out,” Tran said. “Hopefully, performing well at this meet will give us confidence going into the last stretch of the season.”­

“We believe banking should fit your everyday life—not the other way around.” So reads the welcoming lines of the new Peet’s Cafe in Harvard Square. For those wondering, this Peet’s, which doubles as the front counter of a Capital One bank, now sits in the same block as the two Starbucks and two CVS’s in the area, and is within sight of the original Peet’s that sits on the opposite corner. Don’t get us wrong, though—Flyby loves redundancies, and this new development features unreal study rooms, significantly more tables than the overcrowded Crema or T Starbucks, and the promise of 50% off with a Capital One card (no, this post isn’t sponsored).
Armed with a basic chai latte and a special treat of the day, an apple strudel that reminds me of the times that once were (aka, before the dining hall changed its apple crisp recipe to something that consistently contains less crisp), I sat down to record Flyby’s latest edition of Overheard:
“I think my greatest strength is probably my ability to follow through on multi-step projects. I’ve displayed this in many different settings, but I think the best example of this would be my work in the Harvard College Consulting Group . . .” Ah, beloved internship season, and the even more beloved “my greatest weakness is actually my greatest strength” question, delivered during what seems to be a first-round phone interview. It’s bold to conduct these in a coffee shop, but we wish the best to you, dear survivor of the on-campus recruiting program.
“The top five consulting firms have a very strict recruiting process. I’m not on target to be a competitive applicant, and so I’m going to need to go for the smaller ones.” This is stressful. Why do we need jobs? Why aren’t you on target? Why did we work so hard in high school to deal with this now?!
“This is like, regular Peet’s coffee.” Honestly, I was worried about this too. Was Peet’s within a bank going to be like Starbucks within Greenhouse? Both of our fears were alleviated, though, this appears to be a fully functioning cafe with real coffee.
“I just think there isn’t enough fertile ground for this project, I’d just like the grass to be more moist before we pitch this kind of idea to the group.” Sweet wording.
“I think if you have a bad taste in your mouth when you talk to him, it’s not the right partnership for you.” Before I even have the chance to scooch my square closer to their location to hear more about this juicy gossip, the pair, two twenty-something women, likely graduate students, walk away. Sigh.
Mostly what I learn from this experience is that the baristas at the new Peet’s make beautiful leaf decorations on my coffee and thus enhance the Instagram potential of the entire experience, that I still do not and likely will not have a job, and that this business model seems to be working—in the forty-five minutes I was there, the manager seemed to be quite effectively roping people into signing up for Capital One credit cards. Until next time, Flyby readers.

“It’s Handled”...but Flyby has no idea what “it” is. Kerry Washington, known for her role as Olivia Pope in the hit political drama Scandal, was recently named Woman of the Year by the Hasty Pudding Theatrical Company. Today, she is coming to campus to accept her award.
Or is she?
Olivia Pope is known as Washington D.C’s top fixer—a handler that makes the problems of some of D.C’s richest and most powerful players go away, often with an intense monologue, a twirl of the white coat and, if it’s Fitz she’s dealing with, a trademark quiver of the lip. And she’s been known to do it under pretense, hiding the real reason why she is at a place at any given time.
Flyby has a sneaking suspicion that she’s here to “fix” something at Harvard. After all, this week has been ripe with news: recently, the College abruptly announced that Dean Lassonde was leaving his position as Dean of Student Life at Harvard. For people who were thinking about shopping his class about childhood in America this semester, this announcement was true shock. We suspect that Olivia Pope is working behind the scenes to keep the campus from learning about the real reason behind Lassonde’s decision. Could it be that he is going to *gasp* Yale?  Or is it something simpler? Maybe Lassonde was simply not impressed with HUDS after they added new flavored water dispensers in the Houses.
Or maybe it has nothing to do with Lassonde at all. Last night, undergraduates across the campus were bombarded with emails from a mysterious “Harvard Leads 2016” account. Admittedly, most of the emails were students who still don’t quite understand that replying to a random email list is not the best way to get taken of it. Flyby suspects that the email account was a bot sent by members of the clandestine organization B613 to expose the, shall we say, lapses in the technological education of some of the nation’s top students.
Pomp, circumstance and parades are nice, but Flyby wants to know what’s cooking behind the scenes. After all, if anything needs to be “handled,” it’s the ever-fallible my.harvard system...hopefully before study card day comes around.

Every semester, Harvard students fight the ghosts of the overachievers they used to be that tell them taking 5 classes is a good idea. No matter that 4 courses was overwhelming last term—we’re smart, we can handle going above and beyond...right?
