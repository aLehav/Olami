After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are few other figures in American history as explored or as studied as Abraham Lincoln, America’s 16th president. He is Honest Abe –– the president who led the United States through the Civil War, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation, who fell to an assassin’s bullet, and whose colossal likeness still soars over Washington, D.C. A film about such an iconic figure must accept the great challenge of rising above the many previous books and films.
Undeterred, director Steven Spielberg delivered a masterful, greatly ambitious film with his 2012 feature, “Lincoln.” Spielberg retells Lincoln's story in a refreshing manner, capturing his life as both a national icon and as a private man. Perhaps in tacit acknowledgement of Lincoln’s historical magnitude, Spielberg's two-and-a-half hour epic covers just the final months of Lincoln’s life and presidency. But in this narrow window, "Lincoln" conveys much more than who the famed president was — it also outlines the gravity of his historical moment. At issue is the 13th Amendment to ban slavery. In Spielberg’s telling, Lincoln is determined to pass it for the sake of freedom, equality, human dignity. But he and his allies must navigate racism, hatred, war, and political sludge. Principle against pragmatism, to compromise or to stand firm — these decisions make up the film's thematic core, and the consequences could not be greater.
In a film so dependent on character-driven drama, the depth and expressiveness of each actor’s performance is paramount. In this sense, Daniel Day-Lewis is characteristically superb and penetrative as the titular president: He is at once measured, passionate, and sincere. In Day-Lewis’s performance, there is Lincoln the icon — the towering and top-hatted, virtuous and self-assured leader. But there is also the Lincoln whose melancholy but composed visage betrays the burden he bears and the steadiness he projects. And there is also the Lincoln who dives constantly into meandering stories and jokes, who perhaps enjoys the political game.
Day-Lewis’s star-studded supporting cast deserves much credit, too. Sally Field, as Mary Todd Lincoln, adds further emotional depth to the film; her deep despair over the recent loss of her son and her perennial worry of whom she would lose next are palpable. Tommy Lee Jones, with his booming baritone voice, is well cast as the colorful orator and abolitionist representative Thaddeus Stevens. A pre-"Selma" David Oyelowo and Gloria Reuben also appear in impactful, albeit more limited, supporting roles.
With a measured pace and strong storytelling, these performances come together to weave a compelling narrative. The film is long but does not linger on more cursory moments — especially considering the scale of "Lincoln"'s characters and events. Janusz Kaminski’s patina-tinted cinematography sets the emotional tenor of the film, reflecting the gravity of the historical moment. This makes the conservative use of light even more arresting, from the sun-kissed chamber where the House votes on the 13th Amendment, to the soft, nearly ethereal daylight that illuminates Lincoln’s face in his last days. Likewise, composer John Williams’s score –– a Copland-like modern example of the “American Sound” –– is unusually understated but rich and dynamic. These artistic choices serve to transport audiences to 19th century Washington D.C.
The film is at its best in its most intimate moments. For instance, in a powerful scene where Lincoln sits all night with the telegraph operator (Adam Driver) and slowly reinforces his resolve to fight for the 13th Amendment, even as he risks prolonging the war. Perhaps most stirring are the scenes of hope and joy after the 13th Amendment passes.
Eight years after its release, many of the film’s political themes remain relevant today. At its heart, “Lincoln” is a paean to a man unwavering and ever-persistent in his pursuit of and belief in “the better angels of our nature.” Lincoln, the film argues, was an incrementalist tethered to reality who nonetheless strived for, and achieved, great change.
In recalling the achievements of Lincoln’s final months, Spielberg's film projects a great faith in the American system. At the nation’s most critical juncture, the legislative system accomplished momentous positive change and the president reached for an ever better Union to prove that “democracy isn’t chaos.” It is a message of hope that for many (more so today than eight years ago) will stand as one full of optimism, if tinged with naive idealism.
In the film’s epilogue, Lincoln delivers the final lines of his second inaugural address. “Let us strive on to finish the work we are in,” Lincoln proclaims, “to bind up the nation’s wounds… to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.” These words surely rang loudly in 1865 and reverberated deeply in 2012. Eight years on, within an extraordinary and monumental political and societal moment, Lincoln’s words ring resoundingly still.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s eccentric with a capital “E” and a complete tonal mishmash that shouldn’t work on a conceptual level, but director Azazel Jacobs’ absurdist satire “French Exit” salvages a vibrant, beating heart from the unlikeliest of places. Speaking in a press conference after the film’s premiere as the closing entry of the 58th New York Film Festival, Jacobs said that “French Exit” was a film about “lonely people feeling less lonely as they find each other.” It’s a simple platitude, but ultimately a message that delivers in “French Exit,” with the help of a talented ensemble cast, a witty screenplay, an emotional conclusion, and a powerhouse performance from Michelle Pfeiffer.
Jacobs’ film, adapted from Patrick deWitt’s novel of the same name, follows quirky aristocrat Frances Price (Pfeiffer), who moves to Paris when she loses most of her wealth. She is accompanied by her son Malcolm (Lucas Hedges) and her cat, who is later revealed to be her reincarnated husband (Tracy Letts). Soon, the Prices’ Parisian apartment becomes a cluttered home for misfits which include a psychic, a wealthy American widow, a private investigator and, at one point, even Malcolm’s ex-girlfriend and her would-be fiancé.
The ensemble cast does their best to bring a high level of energy to the film, but it’s hard to see what Jacobs is saying about these characters other than pointing out that they’re all quirky and lonely. There’s nearly no meaningful interactions between these characters aside from exaggerating those two features, and such lack of depth gets frustrating. As with most novel adaptations, it should be expected that a lot had to be shed from deWitt’s novel to meet a limited runtime, but it would have been nice to see the talented cast build more than trivial rapport.
But while Jacobs fails to build a memorable supporting cast, their interactions at least buoy audiences’ attention. deWitt, who is also credited as the film's screenwriter, injects “French Exit” with fast paced quippy dialogue delivered with a hilarious deadpan spin. Yes, it does feel derivative of some Wes Anderson scripts, but it's an approach that really works in Jacobs’ film.
At the end of the day, “French Exit” lives and dies by Pfeiffer’s performance. This is easily the best that Pfeiffer has been in decades, and she once again proves her power as a magnetic screen presence. Here, she walks the fine line between insufferable and naively quirky, and her character’s constant push and pull with mental health grounds the film in a consistent direction whenever it delves too far into the ensemble’s quirky schtick. “French Exit” could be the film that finally gives her Oscar gold after a storied career with three nominations.
That said, “French Exit” will be divisive. It’s a film that peers into the gaudy, insular society of Manhattan aristocrats in a year where such a lifestyle couldn’t be more unpopular with general audiences. But when the Prices lose (some of) their (still relatively large) fortune and move to Paris, Jacobs never asks audiences to pity them. If anything, he takes their most egregious qualities and emphasizes them to form a satire about how the absurdities of the Price's lifestyle have created deeply entrenched emotional detachment. It’s only in this hyper-absurdity that audiences can invest their emotions in these characters.
And at the end of the film, it’s surprising how successful that approach is and how much one is made to care about the stakes — of abandonment and finding second chances. While Jacobs’ film is a bit here and there and all over the place, it hits the right notes thematically when it’s supposed to, and in the end, isn’t that what people go to the movies for?
“French Exit” premiered at the New York Film Festival on Oct. 10 and is scheduled for a theatrical release on Feb. 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every man has thought about killing his wife — or, at the very least, Claus von Bülow has thought about killing Sunny von Bülow. “Reversal of Fortune” is based on former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz’s novel of the same name, which recounts his role as the defense lawyer in the von Bülow attempted murder case. The film is a critically-acclaimed courtroom drama narrated by character Alan (Ron Silver) and his ragtag legal team as they prepare to defend Claus in court, slowly unearthing what happened in the von Bülow household the night Sunny fell into a coma. “Reversal of Fortune” doesn’t just ask whether Claus killed Sunny; it interrogates how judgments of innocence and guilt are made.
"Reversal of Fortune" was originally released in the United States on Oct. 19, 1990, and is just one successful film in director Barbet Schroeder’s celebrated filmography. Starting his career as a producer, Schroeder began directing with “More” (1969), a story of heroin addiction inspired by the United States’ 1960s counterculture movement. The Iranian-born and French-raised filmmaker then transitioned from creating European hits to Hollywood blockbusters, eventually culminating in “Reversal of Fortune.” Upon its release, the film was widely well-received, and was even nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Jeremy Irons, who plays Claus, ultimately won Best Actor.
Thirty years later, “Reversal of Fortune” is just as worthy of the critical acclaim it received decades ago. In the first few minutes of the film, Sunny’s ominous voice narrates over images of her family, as the camera pans until it is revealed that her disembodied voice is associated with a comatose body that lies motionless on a hospital bed. It's a revelation which primes a dreadful suspicion that lingers for the rest of the film, even when Claus explains his claims to innocence. Schroeder's consistent subversion of expectations keeps audiences uncertain as to whether Claus really was responsible for Sunny's death.
This air of doubt is matched perfectly by Irons’ suspiciously secretive performance. But while Irons' performance as Claus was suitably award-winning, the characters who surround him fall flat. When Alan decides to take the case and enlists the help of his students, one voices an apparently obvious concern: Alan should not be defending Claus because he’s clearly guilty. A back-and-forth ensues, in which Alan convinces her that this case is bigger than Claus, and as such, should be taken.
The dialogue, particularly from Alan’s law students, is quick and digestible, serving to propel exposition or clarify a plot point. While Irons’s performance casts a shadow of doubt, the background characters act as a stand-in for the audience. They voice the viewers’ questions and concerns as Alan attempts to untangle the mystery of his client.
All in all, “Reversal of Fortune” is nothing short of an effective mystery movie. Schroeder takes advantage of established plot structures with an inciting incident, buildup, and climax to inch the film towards a final verdict in Claus’s court case. The central conflict of “Reversal of Fortune” is that Claus’s explanation of the events surrounding Sunny's coma hints at his innocence, but his suspicious behaviour and callous demeanor suggests that he is guilty. This doubt is imprinted until the film's final scene, when Alan says goodbye to Claus after winning the appeal in court. Alan looks Claus dead in the eyes and doesn’t answer the movie’s central question, but rather pushes uncertainty over the edge as he tells him, “morally, you're on your own.”

What separates humans from animals? Could it be the ability to procure and disseminate alcohol in Prohibition-Era America? Is it possessing the means to fix boxing matches and silence rival gangs in a grimy urban city? Is it doing all of this while sharing a laugh and a drink with the mayor in an office overlooking a speakeasy? If these are the criteria, the cast of mobsters in the Coen brothers’ 1990 film “Miller’s Crossing” are most certainly human. Unless, of course, being human is a question of “friendship,” “character,” or “ethics,” as one murderous mob boss so daintily puts it.
From the grifting, fedora-touting henchmen to the discussions of power in smoky mob headquarters, “Miller’s Crossing” contains all the elements of a classic crime flick. Yet the Coen brothers infuse this narrative with a vigor that transcends the genre mold: “Miller’s Crossing” is simultaneously a caricature of, and a love letter to, noir and all of its outrageous tropes. The Coen brothers satirize the romanticization of the early 20th century crime scene with over the top set pieces, while managing to engage audiences with the central character's jarringly grave inner conflicts. "Miller's Crossing" should be revisited and praised for its timeless perspective on an ephemeral era, and genre, of American life.
“Miller’s Crossing” centers on the affairs of Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) — a casual, perpetually boozed-up yet sharp-witted handyman who never fails to rattle off a quip in the face of danger — as he navigates the shifting power dynamics of an unnamed metropolis in 1920s America. Tom must ultimately decide to whom, or to what values, he’s most loyal in his dealings with feuding mobsters Leo O’Bannon (Albert Finney) and Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) — an Irishman holding onto control of the city and an Italian threatening to seize it. The conflict arises when bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) snitches on one of Caspar’s boxing fixes and Caspar wants him dead, but O’Bannon, who's romantically involved with Bernie’s sister, wishes otherwise. As this context demonstrates, the connections and allegiances of the cast of characters flanking Tom get very messy, very quickly.
Audiences might not be so initially keen on immersing themselves in the mob world of the 1920s — a setting so specific and perhaps irrelevant to life today — but the Coen brothers craft a surprisingly engaging cinematic experience with this web of uniquely humorous, violent, and bizzare personas. The characters' differing motivations feel wholly representative of humanity’s ideological diversity. Take “the Dane” (J. E. Freeman), for example — Caspar’s cold, calculating right-hand man; or the bookie’s sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Haden), whose flirtatious antics veil a deep concern for the wellbeing of her brother. The distinct motivations, afflictions, and beliefs of each character, while portrayed in period-specific light, are not exclusive to the period. The Coen Brothers link their local mobster world with human experiences that resonate across decades.
The way the film frames each character further heightens their signature traits. We see the Dane’s menacing black gloves before we see the Dane himself, and when he is revealed for the first time, it's from a low-angle shot that emphasizes his large, towering stature. The Coen brothers employ deliberate blocking to introduce the audience to Verna, who’s first seen opening the door to her apartment and posing casually for Tom; yet a caution underlies her seemingly amenable invitation. Moreover, the brief, fleeting cuts that accompany characters of shallow interests and cheap morals directly contrast how the audience sees Caspar, who’s long-winded ramblings of ethics and friendship are accentuated by drawn out close ups. “Miller’s Crossing” is not the story of a man but of a world — one inhabited by characters to be viewed through purposefully crafted lenses that mirror their idiosyncrasies.
While the Coen brothers’ take on noir is rendered unique by its outrageous characters, “Miller’s Crossing” still leans on the genre’s classic motifs in an endearing way. One can only be reminded of Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather” when viewing Leo O’Bannon’s dimly lit study or Tom’s drive out into the forest to “whack” a rival gangster. And despite the uproarious clashes between police and the mob (think several minutes of extended shooting at close range with no carnage), the film takes on a certain gravity as Tom continues to grapple with such matters as romance, trust, and imminent death — matters familiar to gangster film aficionados, and perhaps matters that truly separate humans from animals.
The Coen brothers present us with a wonderfully mesmerizing period piece, yet it doesn’t feel quite right to call it a period piece. “Miller’s Crossing” is more a discussion about the human condition and the values that shape it, employing an era of American history rife with intrigue to frame that discussion. And while teasing its tease-able tropes, the Coen brothers acknowledge the noir genre’s rich legacy by coupling its dark themes with an irreverent lightheartedness. For a 30 year-old movie about 100 year-old events, “Miller’s Crossing” can certainly resonate with audiences today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it became apparent that the United States presidential race would be called in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr., a tweet concerning the fate of outgoing Trump administration officials read: “Today’s game is, ‘Who goes to jail and who gets to be visiting faculty at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government?’” For many students at the Kennedy School, this was no joke.
While such hires are expected as presidential administrations shift from one party to another, the prospect of Donald J. Trump’s officials finding a home at Harvard has students concerned about the normalization of anti-democratic behavior and the future of American democracy.
This is why I led an effort to launch an open letter demanding the University set up clear and transparent guidelines about hiring any former Trump officials that ensure accountability for their work in this administration.
The letter calls on Harvard to uphold its foundational principles as outlined in a letter signed by multiple University administrators, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, shortly before the election, “Reaffirming our Commitments”: First, a “free and honest inquiry in the unfettered pursuit of truth;” second, “practices and institutions that enhance the common good;” and third, “a just Harvard and a just world where all people’s rights and dignity are respected and honored.” Students should be worried that Trump administration officials would irrevocably corrupt these principles as Harvard faculty members.
As students, we have the right to demand a fact-based education. The Trump administration has not simply disregarded truth, it has embraced lying. President Trump’s campaign was built as a disinformation apparatus, designed to drown out the truth with noise and conspiracy theories. This strategy creates a haze of conflicting versions of the truth that leaves Americans grasping in the dark for what to believe. Those involved in any of these perverse schemes do not deserve to have the Harvard “veritas” in their credentials.
The Trump administration has also attacked the institutions and norms that have been regarded as sacrosanct by Americans for as long as this country has existed. “The success of America depends on the right to vote, a free and independent press, checks and balances, the peaceful transfer of power, and the rule of law with equal justice for all,” the University administrators wrote. In addition to attacks on the press, refusals to cooperate with Congressional oversight, and interference with independent investigators, members of this administration also carried out an extortion scheme in Ukraine, attempting to influence U.S. elections — a scheme for which the president was impeached.
Most alarming is the president’s attack on the credibility of our own elections, making claims of voter fraud without evidence as its central strategy. It is still unclear whether he will peacefully transfer power in January. Normalization of these actions, especially at a place like Harvard, is a real threat to American democracy, and incentivizes authoritarian power grabs that destabilize democracies around the world.
My most personal objection that is not mentioned in the open letter lies with the unacceptable ethical lines that members of this administration have crossed through the implementation of cruel, immoral policies for purely political purposes. The president’s Cabinet is reported to have voted to implement the child separation policy at the border that left more than 500 children without parents. Similarly, as the pandemic accelerated, the president’s top advisers allegedly suggested a policy that dropped COVID-19 testing plans for states governed by Democrats so the administration could profit politically from these deaths. This administration has also targeted our own community of international students relentlessly, first through a ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries and then by attempting to kick students out of the country in the middle of the pandemic. Trump administration officials must be held accountable for these egregious breaches of ethical lines.
I support this request while remaining wholly committed to freedom of speech and diversity of thought at Harvard. An integral part of our educational experience includes being challenged with viewpoints that differ from our own. This petition does not call for censorship of that dialogue; it is asking for more of it. Supporting freedom of speech does not mean we must allow lying with impunity.
Furthermore, this petition is not requesting a ban, but is asking for accountability and transparency. The fact that such a measured and reasonable request is harangued and mischaracterized as a ban demonstrates an inability to have a nuanced discussion about responsibility.
Those of us signing on to the open letter understand that many people in the administration are career officials who put country first and fought against these harmful policies from the inside. This situation is nuanced and many Trump administration officials have a lot to offer the student body. We are simply asking for guidelines that ensure people in the administration are held accountable for their actions, and transparency of how that accountability affects the hiring process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last October, the Cambridge City Council decided to allocate Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funds toward housing homeless individuals. The proposal is encouraging, perhaps even life-changing for a handful of individuals. The City Council seems increasingly committed to helping those experiencing homelessness in our area, and we commend it for doing so.
But a few dozen housing vouchers — a type of short-term, palliative measure — are insufficient. The city’s policies and vision should not be limited to just improving the immediate situation, even if such improvements are urgently needed. It ought to think big about how to build an economy and society that works for everyone.
Homelessness is a policy choice. It isn't some unavoidable and inescapable phenomenon or a fixed societal feature that we can only hope to mitigate. Rather, homelessness is the result of bad policies and politicians’ lackluster efforts to reimagine them in a comprehensive way. Active policy-making can help eradicate homelessness — other countries are already on track to do so. And so, even if preventing the currently vulnerable from slipping into homelessness is vital, the City Council must wrestle with the problem in its entirety. That means acknowledging that we've been facing this same humanitarian crisis for decades. A long-term, comprehensive plan to address it — including strengthening Cambridge's economy — is long overdue.
But what should be done in the meantime? How should the council reckon with the current crisis while seeking to address its root cause?
When it comes to short-term approaches, the coming months will prove crucial.
As the city is no doubt aware, winter is quickly approaching — a major concern for the homeless under normal conditions but especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which homeless shelter capacity in the city has taken a hit. The Harvard Homeless Shelter continues to be closed, while others have taken on social distancing guidelines, which have forced them at times to turn away guests.
On Nov. 21, Middlesex County, with daily new cases on an upward climb, hit their highest number of new cases in a day since early June, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that homeless individuals are a particularly vulnerable group. The safety of the homeless is urgent — quite literally vital with lives on the line.
Cambridge needs a plan for the coming months, and soon. Harvard should consider how it too can help. Last semester, Harvard and MIT teamed up to fund a temporary emergency shelter, collectively donating $500,000. We urge Harvard to commit a similar amount this winter, as a situation of even greater severity approaches.
Through its voucher program, the Cambridge City Council has demonstrated acknowledgment of the immediacy of the homelessness crisis. Indeed, research has underscored the efficacy of housing vouchers when it comes to mitigating the turmoils of homelessness, and we are excited to see this program get underway.
Still, this solution has its problems. First, voucher programs tend to be selective to an extent that may make them ineffective even once distributed to the neediest.
Second, in Cambridge, even from the outset the voucher program is not meeting the scale of the homelessness problem. It promises vouchers to between 40 and 45 individuals. That’s a small fraction of Cambridge’s substantial homeless population and may not even meet the total number of unsheltered people within that population.
Finally, and to our initial point, voucher programs, especially on such a small scale, are a stop-gap measure, not a systemic solution.
We’ve turned to discussing homelessness in Cambridge frequently this year, and we hope our pieces help spur deeper reflection about the needs and vulnerabilities of this population. That means both short-term care but also long-term reflection on the systemic injustices that produce homelessness in the first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Club Penguin may well be the new Hinge, at least for Janet Hernandez ’24 and Charles E. Neuhauser ’24.
At the beginning of quarantine — the 15th of March to be exact — the two of them hopped on a group call for early admits. Torn from the pages of any classic love story, Hernandez caught Neuhauser’s eye from across a crowded Zoom.
Neuhauser, from Massachusetts, had “noticed” Hernandez before on social media. So, when the Floridian asked the group of early admit students, “Does anyone want to play [Club Penguin]?,” his response — “I do!” — was instantaneous. Assuming Neuhauser was just being friendly, Hernandez could never have guessed that a game of Club Penguin would lead to a nine-month relationship — two-thirds virtual, one-third together on-campus.
We live in a dystopian era where the bottom of your face is a mystery to be uncovered, where you often have no idea if the person you’re speaking to is 6-foot-4 or 4-foot-6, where instead of standing “one bible distance apart” (as many of us were advised in middle school) college students are being instructed to stand six feet apart. How on earth do two first-years find each other, let alone stay together?
As we oscillate between our pixelated and embodied selves, we must elevate the status of digitally developed relationships, and appreciate the ways in which these platforms allow us to be uniquely available to one another.
Zooming with the freshman couple, despite sitting in a different room from them, we shared an air of levity. Throughout our conversation, their eyes continually drifted back to one another, as they exchanged cheeky grins and knowing giggles.
The two characterize their relationship as “unexpected.” Neither one had planned to have a relationship in college, especially given Harvard’s dating culture mythos (or lack thereof). “Either you hook up a lot, or you’re married,” Hernandez succinctly put it.
After months of speculative texting, Snapchats, and FaceTime calls, everything suddenly became very serious when Hernandez visited Neuhauser in June, while en route to seeing another friend in Martha’s Vineyard. Without the obvious boundary offered by a screen, Neuhauser said that as they were “actually interacting and figuring things out” for the first time, they had to navigate the new challenge of “balancing expectations” for an in-person relationship.
“It’s different to be available virtually than to be available physically,” shared Hernandez.
Descending onto Harvard’s campus two months later, they were confronted by additional, unexpected challenges: Hernandez described the difficulty of forming new connections with friends, since she was already attached to someone headed into college. Neuhauser, on the other hand, had more time to socialize during quarantine, meeting new classmates in group chats and other forums, so he struggled less to balance their relationship with new friendships.
The heightened need for clear communication, presented by the pandemic, however, has served to strengthen their bond.
“I feel like it makes it easier in the pandemic to really get to know a person beyond physical stuff, because you're just kind of forced to be without that physical aspect of the relationship for a little bit,” Hernandez said.
Overall, despite social distancing measures attempting to keep them apart, they easily found ways to spend time together. Their fall in love was filled with walks by the river, ventures into Boston, and outdoor meals. They ritualize “countdowns” to special occasions, punctuating their burgeoning relationship with little moments of planned celebration.
I learned that our call was during one of those moments. The carnage of empty pizza boxes lying before them memorialized their final night on campus together.
After three months of seeing each other nearly every day, their relationship will fold back into its mostly two-dimensional form, as Neuhauser returns home for the rest of the semester, and Hernandez, granted a housing extension, continues to live on campus.
Assessing the landscape of Harvard’s first-year dating scene, Neuhauser speculates that “there are definitely fewer hookups.” Finishing his sentence, Hernandez adds that this is “because people are a lot more cautious bringing people into [their] dorms.” Although they assure me through laughter that there are still “plenty” of first-years going out: Harvard’s not-so-infamous dating scene is very much alive.
While their story is uniquely theirs, it also illuminates wider trends emerging across the United States: People are forming deeper connections online, and the number of quality conversations on dating apps is increasing. In March, the in-app video chatting feature on Bumble increased by 93 percent in America, while Hinge observed a 30 percent increase in its messaging feature, during the same period.
Hernandez and Neuhauser’s story is a testament to the authenticity and creativity of relationships, romantic and otherwise, that can be catalyzed and maintained via a multitude of online platforms.
I recently noticed that I frequently refer to the friendships that I have developed online over the past few months as “virtual friendships.” There’s a slippage in the language here, as if I’m saying not only that they’re virtual but that they’re virtually friendships. And that’s not fair to me or my new friends — diminishing meaningful connections. We need to overcome the mindset that a relationship only becomes “real” when we are together in person. That just can’t be true anymore.
At the same time, on that fateful day when we do finally unfold into our three-dimensional forms, we cannot expect that the relationships we have formed online will be perfectly replicated. Just like we had to adjust to online social life, we’re going to have to adjust back to in-person relationships, which will necessitate open lines of communication and consent, as we strive to reintroduce physical ease into the nuanced contours of our new relationships.
For Neuhauser and Hernandez, the weeks ahead, apart again, don’t worry them that much; perhaps surprisingly, at this point, a month or two away from one another seems very manageable.
“Hang in there,” Neuhauser says to those looking for love. As in any relationship, he advises, the key is to listen, communicate, and be patient.
Whether you lock eyes in a crowded Zoom or during a masked encounter, love remains as contagious as ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard dismissed a Title IX complaint from a transgender student this month who alleged comments Anthropology professor Arthur M. Kleinman made during a public confrontation in a General Education class in September constituted sexual misconduct.
The complaint stemmed from a heated exchange during General Education 1093: “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Cares? Reimagining Global Health” over Zoom Sept. 15, during which Kleinman told the student, Kai De Jesus ’24, that she would likely be murdered in rural China due to her gender identity. Kleinman apologized a day later for expressing himself “somewhat clumsily” and told the class he regretted any harm his comment had caused.
De Jesus filed a Title IX complaint against Kleinman over the incident on Oct. 1, alleging that the comment was unwelcome conduct based on her gender identity that created a hostile environment for her in the classroom.
“I no longer feel as comfortable speaking up in class or asking questions,” she wrote in the complaint, which she provided to The Crimson. “It deeply affected my education.”
The exchange began with a discussion of 20th-century philosopher Frantz Fanon’s writings, which defend the use of violence and lay out the difficulty of including white people in anti-colonial struggles. Kleinman expressed his opposition to that position during the lecture, arguing that violence begets further violence.
During the question and answer session, De Jesus argued Fanon’s theories should not be dismissed outright because, as a transgender woman of color, she had benefited from the exclusion of white people in certain contexts because it made her feel safer. De Jesus said she began her question with “while I don’t believe we should kill all white people” before arguing that Fanon’s theories have some merit, but she believes Kleinman and others misheard her.
During her question, she referenced a quote attributed to 20th-century Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad calling white people blond-haired, blue-eyed devils.
Kleinman said in an interview that De Jesus’s question amounted to a “diatribe against whites.”
“It seemed to me for sure this was bordering on hate speech, and I had to intervene,” he said.
Kleinman said he meant his response to explain that in a global health course, it is important to recognize that violence takes place in many different societies and is not only perpetrated by white people.
Kleinman said he “completely” rejected any view that the comment was a personal attack towards De Jesus or transphobic. Faced with the same situation again in the future, he said he would respond the same way, only being much more careful with his word choice.
“I apologize for a clumsy use of language, but my intention and what I was trying to do was to deal with something that I feel you can't just let stand in any course, but certainly a course like this,” he said.
De Jesus said she filed the complaint because “it shouldn’t be normal” for a professor to discuss their student’s potential murder.
“I’m not looking for punishment, I’m looking for safety,” she said. “I just don’t see how I’m supposed to learn when I’m being told I’m going to be killed, and I don't see what academic usage that type of language serves.”
De Jesus said she has suffered violence due to her gender identity in the past. A man tried to drown her after she came out as transgender and wore nail polish, she said. She also cited her arrest by Boston Police last year while she was protesting at a controversial “straight pride” parade; the charges were later dropped.
After a month-long investigation, Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution — which investigates formal Title IX complaints — dismissed the complaint, finding that the alleged conduct would not have violated FAS policy as it was not “pervasive” or “objectively severe,” according to a letter sent to De Jesus Nov. 6.
Harvard spokespeople Jonathan L. Swain and Rachael Dane declined to comment on behalf of ODR and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Several students in the course said Kleinman’s comment made them uncomfortable, and bordered on hypocrisy because the course bills itself as focused on decolonization and caregiving.
“That kind of comment is completely unacceptable, particularly within this global health context that we are thinking about, ‘how do we best care for people,’” Alejandro C. Eduarte ’23 said. “It was really disheartening to see firsthand that Kai — a trans woman of color — was directly just not valued in that class.”
Jenny J. Yoon ’23 said Kleinman’s comment “didn't seem right” to her in that it erased individual experiences. She added that she felt faculty should note their own backgrounds and positions of power over students when responding to students’ opinions.
“It’s important for everyone’s narratives and experiences to have equal say, in that kind of situation where there’s an inherent power dynamic,” she said. “I think there could have been more productive ways to go about the discourse.”
Two students, however, noted they felt De Jesus’s comment leading into the discussion was inappropriate.
Shah Faesal, a Kennedy School student enrolled in the class, wrote in an email that “analyzed reductively,” De Jesus’s question did seem to justify “extermination of the white race to bring an end to the race problem.”
“The subject was very explosive, and the heat was expectedly high,” Faesal wrote. “But then in a debate, where the only objective is to bring out the issues and learn, if we respect one person’s right to ask controversial questions, we must respect another person’s right to give controversial answers.”
Medical School professor Salmaan Keshavjee, who co-teaches the course with Kleinman and two other professors, called the incident a “painful episode,” but said he believed Kleinman had no intent to harm.
Lindsey M. “Marty” Alexander, the class’s head teaching fellow, said in the 10 years Kleinman has been her mentor, she has only known him to bring a caregiving mindset to his interactions with students.
“I know that it pains him that this exchange left any student feeling upset, and he has apologized for it twice now,” she said. “We want to create an inclusive, safe classroom and we took actions that we hoped would do just that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students who spent the semester on campus have now departed for the year, those remaining in the dorms are bracing to spend Thanksgiving mostly alone, with some even preparing to ride out the winter in Cambridge.
In October, the College announced a petition process that would allow a select group of students to remain on campus through the end of the semester and winter break. Those who petitioned for housing included international students unable to return home due to travel restrictions, students with health or safety concerns at home, and students with home environments detrimental to academics.
Students remaining through the end semester will be assigned to one of four dining halls — in Currier, Kirkland, Leverett, and Quincy Houses — that will remain open through Dec. 19. For those spending the winter break on campus, Harvard will provide a $30 daily Crimson Cash meal stipend beginning Dec. 20.
Students residing on campus over the summer also faced a largely empty campus and skeleton services. During the spring, dining services were reduced to limit contact between students and staff.
Rachel A. Harris ’24, who lives in California, said the College granted her housing through the end of semester to mitigate the academic disruption that changing time zones would cause. She also said she expects the campus atmosphere to change with fewer students around, but is not worried.
“A large portion of the campus life that has sort of formed this semester will be significantly less present,” she said. “But I'm not too apprehensive about that. I think it's definitely going to be different from the semester.”
Zeynep R. Bromberg ’24 said she is worried about being lonely during break but decided that remaining on campus was the best decision academically.
“I'm worried that I'm going to be holed up in my room for the next few weeks without really much else, since it is getting colder,” Bromberg said. “I'm really grateful for the opportunity to be able to stay but I am apprehensive and nervous about not having too many people around.”
Jordan Mubako ’22 said he is thankful for being able to stay in residence through the winter, but anticipates campus will be a lonely place with most students gone. Mubako, who is from Zimbabwe, lived at Harvard during the summer and said he remembers it as a “ghost town." He expects winter break to be a similar experience.
“Personally it was kind of tough, not seeing anyone,” he said. “Having less people just minimizes the encounters, and I think it's going to be a lot worse because it’s going to be cold and dreary. I would imagine it's going to be a relatively lonely environment.”
“I'd love nothing more than to be back with my family,” Mubako added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday afternoon dedicated towards increasing accountability of the Community Council and the Harvard University Police Department.
The first piece of legislation endorsed the publication of a statement by the Council to push for transparency in the actions taken by the Community Council. It was sponsored by Elm Yard representative Edwin B. “Eddie” Jin ’24 and Crimson Yard representative Shreya P. Nair ’24.
The Community Council is one of the steps that the College has taken to ensure that students living on-campus are abiding by the rules set in a compact that each student signed. It has power to remove students from campus if they are found to violate the compact, which occurred at least once this fall when first-years were sent home due to gatherings held in their dorms.
The statement read that the “highly secretive nature of the Community Council meetings” contributes to the anxiety of students living on-campus.
The UC statement pushed for the Community Council to release anonymized statistics about its actions and details of the meeting process with students who are brought to the Community Council for judgment. It also called on the College to provide support and guidance to students who go through the Community Council process as well as resources for students who are asked to leave campus. Finally, it asked the College to clarify if evicted students are to be reimbursed for room and board costs for the remainder of the semester that they are not on campus.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane said in an email that the Community Council plans to release aggregated statistics once the fall semester concludes.
The legislation argued that students facing eviction are in need of assistance.
“Although students who break the Community Compact merit a measured, proportional, response, those who are asked to leave campus face many high hurdles and challenges when relocating and readjusting,” the statement read. “We urge the DSO to consider the needs of these students in planning for the spring semester.”
The Council also passed legislation establishing an undergraduate task force within the Council to “collect input from student communities, particularly underrepresented communities, and inform the practices of HUPD on campus.” It was sponsored by UC President James A. Mathew ’21 and Vice President Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21.
“There is a need to keep campus police accountable and hear from students on campus safety on a regular basis, beyond the current period of chief selection and HUPD external review,” the legislation read. The task force would consist of members of several campus organizations, including affinity groups and political groups.
The legislation builds upon a similar task force established in August, whose purpose was to help inform the HUPD Chief Search Committee after the retirement of former chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton and HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Crimson.
The previous task force “has proved valuable as a forum for undergraduate student input and recommendations for HUPD practices,” the legislation read. “The matter of campus policing is especially important to ensure safety and well-being for underrepresented students.”
Both acts passed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six members of Harvard’s Class of 2021 reacted with tears of gratitude, shouts through windows, and dozens of phone calls to socially distanced friends and families after receiving the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship this weekend.
After receiving the news from childhood bedrooms and campus dorm rooms in the Rhodes Trust’s first virtual selection process, the six students will join Rhodes Scholars from more than 60 other countries to begin their graduate studies at the University of Oxford in England in October 2021.
Harvard College boasted the most American Rhodes recipients of any university this year, according to the American secretary of the Rhodes Trust’s public announcement of the winners Sunday. 375 Harvard students have now been named American Rhodes Scholars since the award was established in 1902; this year, College students made up nearly 20 percent of the 32 American winners.
Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21, a joint concentrator in Social Studies and History of Science from Beachwood, Oh., said she is grateful to her friends and parents who encouraged her to apply for the Rhodes Scholarship, even when she herself was unsure.
“I was diagnosed with cancer this time last year, and so I was dealing with chemotherapy all throughout last semester,” Srinivasan said. “I would never have imagined that by this time this year I would be done with treatment, I would have started writing multiple theses, that I would be applying for — let alone winning — the Rhodes Scholarship.”
Wilfried K. Zibell ’21, a joint concentrator in Comparative Literature and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from Noorvik, Alaska, said he hopes to study imperialism and displacement at Oxford.
“At Harvard, I’m currently looking at Inuit and Yiddish literature, specifically at how displacement and empire affect literature and identity,” Zibell said. “At Oxford, I will be moving from a literary analysis to an economic analysis and understanding how economic development can be both oppressive and liberatory.”
Elijah C. DeVaughn Jr. ’21, who is concentrating in History and Literature and hails from Compton, Calif., said he hopes to use his time at Oxford to further explore his interest in criminal justice reform by studying the respective journeys of Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X to the UK in the 19th and 20th centuries.
“I understand criminal justice to be the civil rights issue of this generation, and so it only makes sense to me that I follow in the footsteps of Douglass and X and journey to the UK, both to study how they built transnational coalitions in their time, but also how I can do that in my life,” DeVaughn said.
Nkaziewoh N. Nchinda-Pungong ’21 said he has been inspired both by the diversity of subjects Rhodes Scholars study, but even more so by his fellow scholars’ shared focus in “increasing access to resources for the underserved.”
“Before getting the Rhodes, back in March before I even knew I wanted to apply, I knew it was for people interested in public service, that you got to go to Oxford, and that it was prestigious, but I didn’t really know what it meant,” Nchinda-Pungong, a Biomedical Engineering concentrator from Oak Creek, Wis., said. “Everybody that I met was awesome — it felt almost like the first time I came to Harvard, where everybody was an expert in one thing or another that I had no idea about, yet also people were down-to-earth, which I really liked.”
Carissa J. Chen ’21, a History concentrator from Tustin, Calif., said she feels “really lucky that society has given me so much.”
“Even being able to study at Harvard is amazing, and having the chance to go to Oxford is incredibly exciting, and I really hope that I can do something to thank all of those in society who have helped me, supported me, believed in me.”
Shera S. Avi-Yonah '21, a History concentrator from Lincoln, Mass., serves as the Managing Editor of The Harvard Crimson.
The Canadian secretary of the Rhodes Trust has yet to announce the Canadian recipients of the scholarship; students from around the world will receive word of their selection in the coming weeks, bringing the total class to more than 100 recipients.
A complete list of the American recipients from Harvard is below:
*Shera S. Avi-Yonah ’21

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 1,300 sophomore students declared their concentrations virtually last Thursday evening, drawn mostly towards concentrations consistent with past years.
Though sophomores have spent half their time in college away from campus, many students still said they felt prepared to make informed decisions about their chosen concentrations from a remote setting.
Economics was by far the most popular concentration, with more than 180 sophomores currently declared, according to an internal College student directory. Computer Science was the second most popular, numbering around 130 newly declared students, while Government was the third favorite at roughly 120.
Harvard’s total number of Computer Science concentrators has quadrupled in the past decade: The department went from 99 Computer Science concentrators in 2010 to 407 in 2019. On the other hand, the number of Government concentrators shrunk from 475 in 2010 to 313 in 2019. The Economics department saw fairly consistent concentrator numbers over the same time span, and counted 612 undergraduates among its ranks in 2019.
Rachel Chau ’23, one of about 80 Neuroscience concentrators, said she only started thinking about her concentration choice during the summer, after learning already moved to a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I was choosing between some of the sciences, and I ended up doing some research on all of them, just talking to upperclassmen and talking to advisors,” she said.
Chau also said she feels the transition to the virtual concentration exploration process has been smooth.
“The neuroscience department did a pretty good job of reaching out and kind of letting people know what it's about,” she said.
Zavier S. Chavez ’23, a Philosophy concentrator, also said his process of declaring a concentration was easy, despite the virtual environment.
“I’m ROTC now, so I can have a guaranteed job right after college because I'm doing the legal route. I'm in a very fortunate position where I can just kind of pick whatever I like the most,” he said.
Audrey L.H. Ory ’23, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator, said she declared weeks before the deadline.
“I kind of went into Harvard knowing I wanted to concentrate in biology. I was in between [Human Evolutionary Biology] and MCB, and I took a class in the spring that led me more in the MCB direction,” Ory said. “Actually, it was a pretty easy decision for me.”
Ory said the MCB department made declaring a concentration very simple.
“Especially based on some of my friends’ experiences, MCB was particularly easy. They reached out to me in an email many weeks ago, having me fill out a survey and set up a meeting with the concentration head,” Ory said. “And then that was basically it.”
Chau reassured freshmen that they should not spend too much time worrying about their concentration in advance.
“If I had advice for freshmen – next year, don't worry about it. Yes, it will work out, hopefully,” she said.

Three researchers — two from Harvard and one from the University of Alberta — have conducted simulations that suggest weather on Jupiter and Saturn may be influenced by different factors than those on Earth.
Harvard postdoctoral fellow Rakesh K. Yadav, Harvard geophysics professor Jeremy Bloxham, and University of Alberta associate professor Moritz Heimpel published the study in the journal Science Advances on Nov. 13.
The researchers simulated convection — the process of warmer fluid rising and cooler fluid sinking — in rotating spherical shells that mimic Jupiter and Saturn’s atmospheres. While surface-level atmospheric mechanisms largely motivate Earth’s weather, the researchers found that Jupiter and Saturn’s weather may instead stem from these much deeper convection patterns.
Previous studies on the weather of large planets like Jupiter and Saturn have been broadly separated into two schools of thought, Yadav said in an interview. The former group believes that weather on these giant planets comes from a thin layer of atmosphere near the planets’ surfaces, similar to Earth. The latter group — which includes Yadav, Bloxham, and Heimpel — argues that deeper internal forces may account for the planets’ unique weather formations.
“We belong to that group, where we think the atmospheres — the features we’ve seen on the surfaces — are likely very, very deep,” he said.
Yadav, Bloxham, and Heimpel’s research focused on two simulations. The first provided insights into the spontaneous generation of weather-related phenomena like zonal jets, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Although the researchers expected to find zonal jets — which are bands around the planet, similar to jet streams — and hurricane-like storms in the simulations, Yadav said the most surprising findings were the cyclones.
“We ended up finding giant cyclones, cyclones that were as large or sometimes even larger than Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. So that was entirely unexpected,” he said.
The second simulation demonstrated how the dynamo region — an electrically conducting fluid region traditionally understood to be inert — may actually play a significant role in initiating and continuing anticyclones. Anticyclones are storms similar to cyclones, but they rotate around a center of high atmospheric pressure.
“On the basis of these two case studies, we can begin piecing together a global picture of the deep convection-driven fluid dynamics occurring in Jupiter and Saturn,” the researchers wrote in their article.
Yadav underscored that simulations provide researchers with the opportunity to analyze the internal forces behind specific planetary phenomena.
“In planets, we can’t go inside and look at how things are changing with time. But in our simulation, of course, we could do that,” he said. “So that’s why in our paper, we could state that this giant Great Red Spot kind of feature in our model is connected to the inside of the planet.”
Yadav said that he hopes the simulations will serve as a launching point for future discoveries.
“We are also in the process of just analyzing it even more. There’s so much data, you can imagine doing a lot more things,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the fall semester wanes, Harvard administrators and faculty took stock of the promise and pitfalls of Harvard College Everywhere, a project the College launched to spur student engagement during the remote semester.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the initiative in a July email to students, describing the program as a set of initiatives aimed at keeping the virtual campus connected. History of Science Professor Anne Harrington ’82 and Phillips Brooks House faculty director Julie A. Reuben serve as the program’s faculty co-directors.
“Harvard College Everywhere was set up to be an incubator for all the main units on campus — academic, athletics, wellness, the arts, student organizations, public service and house life — that normally support residential life on campus,” Harrington and Reuben wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The College built Harvard Everywhere around eight “squads”: academic engagement; arts; diversity, equity, and inclusion; house and yard engagement; public service, civic engagement, and social justice; recreation and fitness; student organizations; and wellness and health promotion.
Harrington and Reuben wrote that Harvard College Everywhere’s key starting goal this semester was to “broaden student awareness” of squad-focus programming by creating a centralized College calendar channel and website.
Squad leaders have largely worked with existing programs and groups to develop activities, most of which have not been under the banner of Harvard College Everywhere, Harrington and Reuben wrote.
“This was fine with us, because the point always was to try to connect students to the College, not to promote some kind of Harvard College Everywhere ‘brand,’” they wrote.
Jack Megan, who co-leads the Arts squad and directs Harvard’s Office for the Arts, wrote in an email he particularly enjoyed a joint Harvard College Everywhere and OFA series dubbed “Off Camera.”
“It involves conversations with gifted artists who are literally off camera now because of the pandemic,” he explained.
The series hosted guests including actress Jameela Jamil of “The Good Place,” actor Ben Schwartz of “Parks and Rec,” and actor Orlando Bloom. Megan said his office has seen “very little attrition” at the events.
Matias Ramos, who chairs the Public Service, Civic Engagement, and Social Justice squad, also said his group has primarily focused on promoting existing public service events and programs hosted by organizations like the Institute of Politics and Phillips Brooks House Association, rather than devising its own events.
Ramos, who also serves as PBHA’s director of programs, said he sees the squad as a “guiding structure” for student organizations. He said he hopes student leaders can use Harvard College Everywhere as a promotional opportunity, source of funding, and space for “advice and collaboration.”
“I think one of [Harvard College Everywhere’s] potential legacies is better coordination among different students facing units in the College that got in conversation more solidly through this effort,” he said.
While Harvard College Everywhere has been successful in a variety of ways, Harrington and Reuben acknowledged that the program faced a number of challenges getting off the ground, notably regarding staff capacity.
“Everyone involved in Harvard College Everywhere has a full-time job and those jobs became even more demanding in the remote context,” they wrote.
They also noted that health risks prevented a number of their plans from moving forward, including connecting students with alumni across the country. Their greatest challenge, however, was securing the student engagement that would have allowed them to understand what undergraduates “want and need.”
“We discovered that the task of meeting student needs off-campus was more complex than we anticipated: we could not simply translate programming designed for a residential experience into a remote form, because student needs changed also,” Harrington and Reuben wrote.
They wrote that they hope to better understand students’ current priorities and interests by polling undergraduates about their interests in a House survey and soliciting ideas at an open meeting on December 7.
“We need to find a way to make Harvard College Everywhere more of a bottom-up and grass-roots undertaking,” they wrote.
Harrington and Reuben wrote that they also hope to move away from Zoom-based activities in the coming semester. To supplement online events, they wrote that they are considering activities such as yoga, music performances, and fitness classes, in addition to knitting, chocolate tastings, and origami.
Khurana said in an interview early November that the College is continuously taking stock of lessons learned about which programs and events work well remotely and which don’t.
“We’re trying a lot of different things. Some things have gone better than others,” he added. “But there's a lot to learn, and we plan to continually improve.”

It’s just a regular day in Cambridge, freshmen making their daily trip to the steps of Widener and tourists taking pictures with the John Harvard statue. Oh, and of course, we can’t forget about the two random turkeys frolicking in the middle of the road, causing a mini traffic jam. It’s a sight to behold, a small break from the chaos of everything else happening right now, and I’m sure the turkeys don’t mind posing for a few seconds anyways.
But why are there turkeys in the middle of the road? Sure, I understand the birds and squirrels, but turkeys weren’t exactly what I had in mind for Cambridge wildlife. What exactly draws them to Harvard’s campus?
Where do they come from?
As described by the official website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, these strikingly handsome birds are an important natural resource in the area. After a near-elimination in the mid-1800s, 37 wild turkeys were reintroduced to Massachusetts in the 1970s. The cohort flourished, and the current estimated population is now between 30,000 and 35,000. Their return is welcomed by sportsmen, naturalists, and other wildlife enthusiasts, but maybe not so much by the tourists who aren’t exactly looking for turkeys on their walk to the John Harvard statue.
Where do they go?
Every now and then, a turkey will wander a little too close to a group of people (we feel ya man, we all need some social interaction these days). So how exactly should we react to these 25-pound birds with some serious looking toes and spurs? While turkeys are typically harmless, they can get aggressive and peck or claw at unsuspecting humans. But don’t be afraid to assert your dominance — put the turkey in its place. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts suggests making loud noises, swatting it gently, or, better yet, reading out your psets to them. It just doesn’t get any scarier than that.
While the occasional turkey can cause quite a ruckus on the Harvard campus, their reappearance is a successful comeback story for many environmentalists. At this point, it’s probably more likely to spot a turkey than it is to see your professors in person. But hey, we’re all hanging in there.
The turkeys are returning. Nature is healing. <3
