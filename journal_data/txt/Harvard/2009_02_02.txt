After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I told a friend, a former section leader in a large Harvard College course, that I had been offered a chance to do an op-ed for The Harvard Crimson on Gaza, she identified two fairly common, understandable undergraduate attitudes: “The situation is too complicated and I can’t make up my mind about it;” and “This is controversial and there are differences of opinion. No side is ‘right.’’”
I hope that the recent war, occurring at the beginning of the Obama presidency, will lead to enough discussion of Israel and Palestine in the Harvard community so that more of us feel able to take positions.  With that in mind, I will use my space to present a factual picture one would think controversial, but which surprisingly is a matter of consensus of “informed observers.” 
The Israeli “new historian” Benny Morris—a strong Zionist—has documented the “Origins of the Palestine Refugee Problem.”  During military operations in 1947 and 1948 against Palestinian resisters and Arab invading armies trying ineffectually to prevent the creation of a Jewish state, Jewish regular and irregular forces, sometimes using carefully calibrated terror tactics, drove somewhere between 600,000 and 800,000 Palestinian men, women and children from their villages, which they then leveled.   After the war, they used force to prevent any of them from returning.  Then the new state summarily confiscated their land and property for redistribution to Jews. The remaining Arab population of Israel—now about 20 percent—eventually received formal legal equality, but live in second-class citizen status similar to that of American blacks in the North before affirmative action and the rise of the new black bourgeoisie. 
In 1967, Israel preemptively attacked Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and occupied the West Bank and Gaza, largely populated by refugees of 1948, as well as East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and Sinai (later returned to Egypt).  This generated another approximately 200,000 Palestinian refugees who were also forbidden to return.  Since 1973, Israeli governments have gradually moved about 400,000 Jewish settlers into the West Bank and another 200,000 into East Jerusalem, appropriating about 50 percent  of the land (when roads and other infrastructure are taken into account), taking over the water, and alternately exploiting and starving the West Bank and Gaza economies to the point where the Arab population is overwhelmingly dependent on the international “donor community” for subsistence. 
Palestinian non-violent and violent resistance to the military occupation is fully legal under international law.  On the other hand, many of the specific tactics, especially airplane hijacking, suicide bombing targeting civilians, including children and old people, and indiscriminate rocket attacks, have been widely denounced as criminal.  
The Israeli government justifies the wall, check points, the network of access roads, the discriminatory legal regime, the pass laws, arbitrary arrests, house demolitions, targeted assassinations, torture, and everyday military control as necessary for the security of the settlements (viewed as illegal everywhere but in Israel), and to protect against terrorism inside Israel.  The international human rights NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the United Nations that have denounced Palestinian terror tactics have unanimously condemned Israel on many occasions for violating the human rights of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
After Israel withdrew its settlers from Gaza in 2005, it retained full control of land and sea borders and of the air space.  It periodically entered the territory with the goal of suppressing rocket fire aimed indiscriminately at southern Israeli towns.  Over the four years before the December 2008 invasion, this rocket fire killed 13 Israeli civilians and made life miserable for tens of thousands of inhabitants of the towns targeted.
After Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006, Israel and the U.S. set out to isolate Hamas by cutting off Gaza from the outside world.  The justification was that Hamas was a terrorist organization “dedicated to the destruction of Israel.” Israel and its allies persisted in this strategy in spite of repeated indications, reported faithfully in the New York Times, that Hamas, like the Palestine Liberation Organization of Yasser Arafat before it, was looking for face-saving means to alter its position and accept a two-state solution.  
The economic and financial sanctions, including stop-and-go electricity and fuel for the people and for institutions like hospitals, along with Israeli restrictions of the movement of goods and persons into and out of Gaza, destroyed what little productive capacity the occupation had left in Gaza. It turned the territory, according to the cliché, into a “prison camp,” where the inmates were dependent on charity and Israeli government whim to keep them precariously one step away from “full fledged humanitarian crisis.” When this did not cause a revolt against Hamas in Gaza, Israel and the U.S., according to an article in Vanity Fair  not yet refuted, organized a PLO coup, which failed, and led Hamas to expel the PLO from Gaza.  There was eventually a truce between Israel and Hamas. 
The Hamas claim, which seems basically sound to me, is that Israel was mainly responsible for its ending: Hamas suppressed almost, but not all rocket fire; Israel retaliated for the residuum by refusing to open the borders, so that Gazan misery continued unabated or worsened, and then carried out an armed incursion in November 2008. When Hamas refused to renew the truce and recommenced rocket fire, Israel invaded. 
Numerous observers have charged Israel with committing war crimes during the war. Without downplaying that aspect, I think it is important to understand the 1,300 Palestinian casualties, including 400 children as well as many, many women, versus 13 Israeli casualties, as typical of a particular kind of “police action” that Western colonial powers and Western “ethno-cratic settler regimes” like ours in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Serbia and particularly apartheid South Africa, have historically undertaken to convince resisting native populations that unless they stop resisting they will suffer unbearable death and deprivation. Not just in 1947 and 1948, but also in Lebanon in 1982 and 2006, Israel used similar tactics. 
Causing horrific civilian deaths is often perfectly defensible under the laws of war, which favor conventional over unconventional forces in asymmetric warfare.  The outright “crimes,” like the My Lai massacre, Abu Ghraib, or Russian massacres in Afghanistan and then in Chechnya, are less important for the civilian victims than the daily tactics of air assault, bombardment, and brutal door-to-door sweeps, meant to draw fire from the resisters that will justify leveling houses and the people in them.
Can this picture be right?  If so, what is to be done? If not, what is to be done? If you are not already clear about what you think, it is crucial to try to find out for yourself.  If the situation is as bad as I have painted, you might consider some small step, perhaps just a contribution to humanitarian relief for Gaza, or e-mailing the White House, or something more, like advocating for Harvard to divest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Law School student was arrested on Jan. 24 after he allegedly threatened Boston Police Department officers and resisted arrest. Charles C. Simpkins, a third-year law student has been charged with two counts, including disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, according to Jake Wark, press secretary for the Suffolk County District Attorney.According to the police report, Simpkins drunkenly stumbled out of a bar in Boston’s Theater District and entered a parked BPD cruiser. Simpkins told officers, “Give me a (expletive) ride, I work for the district attorney’s office,” later adding that he would be willing to “lie and cheat” in order to ruin them.Simpkins had been working as an intern at the Dorchester District Courthouse since September 2007.The DA terminated Simpkins’ internship on Jan. 26, the Monday after prosecutors learned of his arrest.“Particularly disturbing was the fact that [Simpkins] said that he worked at the district attorney’s office,” Wark said.Simpkins was brought to court for his arraignment Jan. 26. Due to the fact that Simpkins’ former position as an intern might present a conflict of interest for any Suffolk County prosecutor, the judge has delayed the arraignment until Feb. 26, according to Wark. The order is intended to allow for the appointment of a prosecutor not affiliated with the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.According to Massachusetts general law, each of Simpkins’ alleged offenses are punishable by a fine or imprisonment for no more than six months, or both.Administrators at Harvard Law School declined to comment on Simpkins’ case on Friday afternoon.

Former UC Presidential candidate Charles T. James ’09-’10 announced his resignation from the UC in a scathing e-mail over Leverett House open-list.“[T]here is an apparent disconnect between the student body’s interests and the UC’s structural approach to advocacy,” he wrote. James unsuccessfully ran for UC President last semester with Micha H. Y. Wong ’10.“While I do not question that most of my fellow representatives serve for the same reason as I, I do question the motives of a few,” he wrote.Current members of the UC, even incoming UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10, agreed with some of his concerns.Reflecting on James’ criticisms of the UC, Flores said some of those issues were the same reasons she almost didn’t run for the presidency.Flores confirmed seeing cases where representatives were “not even representing anyone else’s interest but [their] own.”In an interview, James said that “three-fourths [of UC representatives] have absolutely the right motivation. One-fourth don’t.” That one-fourth, he said, was more fixated on arguing over Robert’s Rules than representing students.UC members were guilty, he said, of making “idiotic points just so they can hear themselves pontificate.”In another part of the e-mail, James wrote, “I personally never enjoyed my time on the UC.”Former UC representative, Jon T. Staff ’10, who served as the chair of the Student Activities Committee echoed James, saying the UC’s political and bureaucratic nature impedes the body’s ability to improve student life.“The undergraduate council, while well-intentioned, is not a good vehicle for change at the University,” he said. “You can get kicked out of the UC for not attending enough meetings, but you can’t get kicked out of the UC for not doing your job.”Despite his frustrations with what he saw as a bureaucratic UC, he is optimistic that the incoming UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 would improve the UC.“I honestly think Andrea can literally turn the UC in the right direction,” he said.Five members will be leaving in total. Two of the representatives are graduating, one is leaving for “personal reasons,” and two, including James, are leaving to spend time working on other efforts to improve student life.Seth A. Pearce ’12, who resigned earlier in the semester, said he left because he wanted to spend more time working directly on issues that he was concerned with but was not dissatisfied with the UC, he said.“In terms of what the UC’s mission is, it does great work,” he said. “It just wasn’t for me.” The council members will be replaced in special elections early this semester, according to incoming UC Vice-president Kia J. McLeod ’10.—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

Flanked by House Committee members and intramural representatives, Winthrop House Master Stephen P. Rosen ’74 blazed through a packed dining hall during brunch yesterday, leading the resounding cheer of “Hail the victors of the Straus Cup”—three months before the cup will be awarded.   In a parade not unlike a bridal procession, Rosen sprinkled fresh rose petals throughout the dining hall—IM aficionados boisterously cheering and chanting behind him—after having baptized their 2007 trophy with frigid water from the Charles River.  “Over the next three and a half months, every person has to do their duty,” Winthrop resident tutor Anthony Niblett said. “Otherwise, this cup will go to one of the [lesser] houses.” Though the Spring intramural season is slated to begin today, Winthrop House residents spent yesterday prematurely revelling in their “inevitable” Straus Cup victory.Rosen and co-Master Mandana Sassanfar joined undergraduates in celebrating the inauguration of the new Winthrop House trophy case—a two-tiered, glass-enclosed display situated in the back corner of the dining hall beneath the House’s imposing lion shield. Still basking in the glow of his house’s Straus Cup victory last year, IM representative Andrew M. Prince ’10 attributed Winthrop’s success (both past and future) to an effective effort to encourage student participation. Prince said that instead of relying on a consistent contingent of 15 to 20 IM participants—which he said other House IM teams are comprised of—Winthrop can rely on wide participation.According to Rosen, who spearheaded the installment of the trophy case, the display serves a dual purpose: commemorating past intramural victories and memorializing the concerted efforts of the House community.  Though Prince said he’s confident that the Straus Cup will remain in its new home, he gave a nod to worthy challengers.“It’s Kirkland House,” he said. “But they’re a distant second.” Even if they do wind up the silver-medal recipients, Kirkland House residents find comfort outside of the IM championship.    “I’d rather get second place every year and live in Kirkland House than ever live in Winthrop House,” said Kirkland HoCo secretary Kelly N. Bodwin ’11.  —Staff writer Bita M. Assad can be reached at bassad@fas.harvard.edu.	—Staff writer Ahmed N. Mabruk can be reached at amabruk@fas.harvard.edu.

The new state budget proposed by Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 calls for raising the cap on charter school spending to 12 percent from nine percent—a move that could allow for the creation of a fourth charter school in Cambridge.The proposal was met with criticism from interest groups and educators on both sides of the charter school debate.  Although the governor’s proposal would allow more students who want to attend charter schools to do so, the additional funding comes with the stipulation that 80 percent of the new schools’ enrollment should come from historically low achieving populations, including low-income, minority, and special needs students. “He’s setting up charter schools to deal with the most difficult population[s],” said Jed F. Lippard, head of Prospect Hill Academy, a charter school with campuses in both Cambridge and Somerville.Lippard, who believes charter schools are highly effective, said he agreed with the governor’s efforts to make them more accessible. But he objects to the enrollment stipulations, which he said will contribute to the problem of racially and socioeconomically segregated schools—a problem that Cambridge already faces.Robert C. Riordan—a former teacher and administrator in Cambridge Public Schools who now works for a network of charter schools in California—expressed the same concern, saying that the current proposal would mandate a trend towards segregated schools.“Such a requirement would throw the weight of the state behind the current drift toward apartheid schooling,” said Riordan, who pointed out that the current charter schools in Cambridge already serve much higher populations of at risk students than their district counterparts.At Benjamin Banneker, a charter school in Cambridge, about 75 percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunch, compared to the district average of about 45 percent. At both the Community Charter School of Cambridge and Prospect Hill Academy, the number is about 50 percent.Riordan said that mandating these population quotas would hurt efforts to establish schools with balanced populations.“You can imagine that if there were a new charter school with 80 percent of students in need, not that many students of privilege would apply to that school,” he said, adding that the best model would be to have schools reflect the overall population of their communities. But Cambridge Public Schools committee member Marc C. McGovern objects to the funding formula for charter schools in general.For every student that goes to a charter school, money that would otherwise go to the school district would go to the charter school—which, according to McGovern, does not always provide the same services that district schools must offer. “As it stands now, it’s not an equitable funding formula. Allowing more charter schools is going to make things worse in terms of funding. We’re in tough shape here in Cambridge. I don’t think that’s the way to go.”—Staff writer Michelle L.

Football, food, and funny commercials brought students together from throughout the Harvard community to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers triumph over the Arizona Cardinals, 27-23, during Superbowl XLIII last night.
Common spaces all over campus were made available to students, including freshman common rooms, House dining halls, Harvard Hillel, and the Student Organization Center at Hilles theater. 
During the first quarter, tension permeated the Canaday Common Room, as twenty viewers—mostly males—leaned silently and intently towards the television. A football-shaped cake lay nearby, half-eaten.
A more relaxed and chatty mood marked the spacious Holworthy Common Room during the game’s second quarter. 
“This game is definitely a lot more exciting than last year’s,” said Christopher W. Danello ’12, adding that he spent last year’s game with “family and a large bag of chips.”
“This is definitely better for my social life and for my waistline,” Danello said.
Roars of “Yes!” and “No!” burst from viewers as Steelers lineman Harrison scored a last-moment touchdown at the end of the second quarter. 
Both teams boasted ardent fans. Nicholas G. Purcell ’11, who joined roughly forty others watching the game in Adams House Dining Hall, said that the Cardinals seemed to have more supporters in the room because of their underdog status.
“The Cardinals are a true Cinderella story, but the Steelers demonstrate the limitations to the Cinderella story, particularly applied to 200 pound men,” Danello said. “As unfortunate as it is, I predict that the Steelers will triumph.”
At every viewing party, chips, pizza, buffalo wings, and other standard football-watching edibles were plentiful.
A mysterious aroma of bacon filled the Holworthy common room. Curious students traced the source of the smell to the oven, where a “Bacon Explosion”—a recently popularized recipe that wraps Italian sausage and crumbled bacon in a layer of bacon and slathers it with barbecue sauce—was cooking.
“It’s highly unhealthy, but the Superbowl is a great excuse to bake one,” said Timothy J. Alford, a Divinity School graduate who was watching the game in Holworthy.
“We’re having a great time,” Alford said.
Adams House resident Ryan S. Nolan ’09 said that this year’s football fever was not as high as last year’s, when the New York Giants bested the New England Patriots.
“Last year, there was a bunch of drunk Giant fans rioting in the streets,” he said. “It was basically like if John McCain had won the election.”
Nolan had prepared for the excitement by “pre-gaming the game.” 
“Extensively,” he added.
Tension mounted in the game’s final minute, as the Steelers scored a touchdown and the Cardinals seemed upon the verge of countering with a touchdown of their own. In the end, though, the Cardinals could not convert. 
“The fact that it ended on a fumble was pretty disappointing, but overall it was a very exciting game,” Purcell said.

Law School Professor Jody Freeman will leave Harvard to serve as a top environmental policy aide at the White House, the latest in a string of high-profile departures from the school’s faculty.
Freeman, one of the nation’s top experts on environmental policy and regulation, has been named the counselor for energy and climate change in the White House where she will serve as senior advisor to energy and climate czar Carol M. Browner.
Joining an office charged with coordinating the efforts of the many government agencies involved in environmental policy and regulation, Freeman said her primary responsibilities will involve managing the efforts to combat climate change at multiple organizations and agencies with frequently overlapping jurisdictions.
“Our team is working together, under Carol Browner, to coordinate all of the energy related legislation and policy, meaning we play a coordinating role that has a responsibility for climate and energy related matters,” Freeman said.
Freeman will be closely involved in managing both environmental regulation and legislative initiatives in a broad effort to revamp federal climate change policy, she said.
Freeman’s office has already begun work on reforming environmental policy by including proposals in the pending stimulus package that would begin to fulfill President Barack Obama’s campaign promises about fighting climate change.
But in recent months, environmental activists have begun to worry that as the economy continues to deteriorate, action on climate change will become a secondary concern.
Freeman acknowledged that although the White House’s primary focus is on the economy, implementing Obama’s campaign promises on fighting climate change and achieving energy independence remain a priority down the road for the administration.
“President [Obama] has reiterated that his priorities are still his priorities,” Freeman said. “The stimulus is crucial, but he’ll then move quickly on to other issues.”
Colleagues at the Law School praised Freeman’s scholarship on environmental law and said that her addition to the faculty had solidified the school’s environmental law curriculum.
“She is someone who in her scholarship digs into things in all of their detail,” Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon said. “She is not a purely legal analyst but is interested in all the policy dimensions of environmental law.”
Freeman, the founding director of the Law School’s environmental law program and one of Dean Elena Kagan’s prominent hires, is another major loss among the ranks of the school’s top professors.
Freeman is the twelfth Harvard professor and fourth Law School professor to depart academia for the Obama administration.

In a move that bodes ill for University plans to transform its new Allston campus into a mecca for stem cell research, Harvard provost Steven E. Hyman has asked faculty to consider the possibility of housing the department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology in existing University facilities in Cambridge.
The reexamination of the future location of the SCRB department—previously heralded as a centerpiece of science in Allston—came just two months after the University stated that it would be reconsidering the scale and pace of its expansion in response to unprecedented endowment losses.
Besides representing one of the administration’s first major moves to rein in its Allston ambitions, the new plan would have repercussions for departments outside SCRB.  
The molecular and cellular biology department has been asked to prepare plans to vacate the Sherman-Fairchild building in order to provide a unified space for stem cell scientists even if Allston plans are slowed, MCB department chair Catherine Dulac said yesterday.
Dulac’s department would consolidate its operations in the Biological Laboratories and the Northwest building, both of which it already occupies. 
According to an MCB professor familiar with the discussions, the new plan would divert funds originally intended for the science complex in Allston to renovate Fairchild for its new residents. Several stem cell labs, including those of renowned professors Douglas A. Melton and Kevin Eggan, are already located in Fairchild.
The source—who asked to remain anonymous to protect his relationship with University officials—also said that the MCB department has been told to plan for an evacuation of Fairchild in six to twelve months, suggesting that the University will soon release a more definitive timeline for construction projects in Allston.
“We were shocked to hear about the contingency plan, which would involve severe disruption of our operations,” Dulac said. But she noted that no decision on the pace of progress in Allston has been made.
“It has to be clear that this is a ‘Plan B’ in case the Allston campus Science 1 building won’t be built or is delayed,” she said.
Dulac also expressed concern that the move could hamper plans to expand the Center for Systems Biology and the Center for Brain Science, currently situated in the Northwest building.
“We’re trying to find a plan that would be favorable or good for all parties involved,” said Dulac, who has been in communication with University officials to ensure that the move’s repercussions and damage to the department would be minimized. 
But she acknowledged that Harvard’s financial woes require officials to devise contingency plans for University initiatives—including stem cell research—tied to expensive construction projects in Allston.
Harvard received unanimous approval in Oct. 2007 from the Boston Redevelopment Authority to build the First Science building in Allston—a 589,000-square-foot complex intended to house the SCRB department and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Harvard said the building would open in 2011.
The current proposal to keep the SCRB department in Cambridge marks a departure from those plans and from the ambition of conversations last year, when officials were considering the construction of a second science facility across the river.
Douglas A. Melton—who co-directs the Stem Cell Institute and co-chairs the SCRB department—said yesterday that construction of the First Science building was still underway pending a University decision, and that he still hoped to move his department there.
“I’m certain there are contingency plans if Allston doesn’t go forward on schedule, but that decision hasn’t been made,” Melton said. He added that the attention given to the plan to vacate Fairchild was “overblown,” and that the University is considering other options to house SCRB, including the Longwood medical area.
Melton’s colleague Kevin Eggan also said that the future of the SCRB department awaited a University ruling, but that if Allston plans were to “fall through,” he would prefer Fairchild to Longwood, twenty minutes away. 
“I personally think Cambridge would likely be the better home given the important role that this department will play in undergraduate education at the college,” Eggan wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Several members of the Stem Cell Institute interviewed by The Crimson yesterday said they had not heard of any plans to move to Fairchild. But many MCB faculty members said they had heard the plan discussed late last week.
Melton—a renowned stem cell researcher who has created and distributed stem cell lines free of charge for research purposes—has said in the past that an Allston facility would facilitate expansion of the SCRB department and encourage collaboration between scattered stem cell researchers.

After the disappointing opening home loss to Dartmouth—perhaps its main rival for the Ivy crown—the Harvard women’s basketball team had three weeks to mull over the fact that it needed to sweep this weekend’s play to kick start its season. Two games, two wins, job done.In dominating the first 18 minutes against Princeton, the Crimson showed why it was the preseason favorite to win the conference. Harvard (10-7, 2-1 Ivy) jumped out to a 41-22 lead en route to an 82-73 victory over the Tigers (6-11, 1-2) Saturday night in New Jersey.“These wins are really big, especially after the 20-day break where we had to sit with the loss against Dartmouth,” said sophomore guard Christine Matera, who had perhaps her best weekend in a Crimson uniform.While Matera’s hot shooting was central to the victory, Harvard got a lot of help from their post players as well.Sophomore Emma Markley led the Crimson with 22 points, going 10-14 from the field. She added 11 rebounds to claim her fourth double-double of the season.Her partner in the paint, senior Katie Rollins, just missed out on a double-double herself, contributing 12 points and nine rebounds to the cause.“We have a really strong low post game, so it’s just a matter of gaining confidence,” Rollins said. “We haven’t really had the impact we wanted to have in the last couple games. We wanted to really make their defense play us [Saturday].”The two forwards made their presence known from the start, scoring three of Harvard’s first four baskets. With the score tied after five minutes of play, Crimson freshman Brogan Berry made a layup to give Harvard a lead that it would keep until the sound of the final buzzer.A three-and-a-half minute span close to the end of the first half saw the Crimson go on an 11-0 run and take a 19-point lead.“We put on a clinic at both ends of the floor,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.“We were really hitting the open person and moving the ball,” Rollins added.Matera’s play was the story of the first half. Coming off her career-high 17-point-performance on her birthday Friday at Penn, the sophomore went 4-4 from behind the arc in the first half off the bench.“Christine [Matera] is one of the best shooters I’ve ever played with,” Rollins said. “Her decision-making and shot selection is great. We all have so much confidence in her. She’s really finding her rhythm.”“Prior to this I haven’t been shooting the way that I’ve wanted to,” Matera said. “But it finally clicked this weekend.”But Princeton refused to allow the Crimson to take the insurmountable lead into the break. The Tigers answered back with a 13-2 run of their own in the final three minutes of the period to pull back to within eight at halftime.Princeton was in the game the whole second half, making Harvard sweat it out for the entire 20 minutes. Tigers’ sophomore Addie Micir scored a game-high 24 points, showing that Princeton will be able cope fine without the now-graduated Meghan Cowher.“I think Princeton is going to be right there at the top of the league this year,” Rollins said.With 46 seconds remaining, the Tigers pulled to within three. But Harvard went 6-for-6 from the line to ice the game, with Berry, co-captain Emily Tay, and then Markley each making both of their free throws.“We relaxed and Princeton ended making it a ball game,” Delaney-Smith said. “But we hung tough and ended making enough big plays to win.”Tay had a sensational weekend in leading her team to the two big wins. The senior followed up her 22-point night against Penn with 14 points and nine assists Saturday night.Her co-captain Niki Finelli also provided a solid contribution, with nine points, eight boards, and five assists in the game.It’s the same story for the Crimson next weekend, as it travels to Yale and Brown: expecting—and needing—two victories.“We now need to build upon these two wins and go right into the next weekend and do the same thing,” Matera said.—Staff writer Jay M. Cohen can be reached at jaycohen@fas.harvard.edu.
