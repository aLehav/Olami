BELFAST, Maine—I'm very bad at skipping rocks, but I do it anyway.
I gather them at the top of the beach, because that's where the really flat ones are. My dog skips, too, at my heels. He thinks the rocks are like sticks—with each splash, he darts partway into the water hoping to retrieve them. No such luck. They usually sink on first contact with the water anyway. I'm very, very bad at skipping rocks.
I fling the first into the ocean. It hops once, awkwardly to the right. Then it goes under.
I've just finished a summer doing what I do most of the year: writing editorials. It was different than the Crimson, of course. A greater focus on reporting. Facts over flourishes. More of an incentive to write short. My colleagues weren't mostly 19-year-old boys, but 50-year-old men (the gender imbalance was one constant). In many ways, it felt more like freshman year than my life at Harvard now: a whole lot of trying to prove myself. I wanted to impress. I wanted even more to be liked. Every editorial seemed a shot in the dark—or a stone in the surf.
Three skips. Impressive, by my standards.
I did well, for the most part, but it was still hard this summer. It’s always hard when you're supposed to be good at something. My own expectations have always been the toughest to meet, and every now and then it's inevitable that I let myself down. There's a lot to be good at, too. It's not just writing editorials. It's staying sharp in section. It's getting high grades. Saying the right thing in the dining hall or at parties. Being thoughtful to my friends at school and keeping in touch with the ones at home. Calling my parents.
Two skips this time, and then a wave to ruin it.
The stress of a summer job is over, yet the stress of senior year will take its place soon. There are lots of old things to be good at, and new ones too. That only means more chances to fall short. I want to be a better roommate. I want to meet people I haven't taken the time to meet yet. I have more commitments outside of the classroom than ever and a thesis to write in the fall. Right now, though, I'm skipping rocks.
No skips.
“You suck at that,” my mom calls down from our front porch.
“I know,” I call back, happily.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SEATTLE—After a 10-hour flight filled with old movies, dry airplane snacks, and the horrendous smell of un-brushed teeth emanating from the guy sitting next to me, I am relieved to step off the plane and get out of the airport.
While in the car, I remember the past few months: rowing a Dragonboat down the Grand Canal, sipping fine wine by at the Seine at sunset, and snorkeling in the vivid blue waters of Croatia. I have lived the fantasy of a typical wanderlustful 19-year old college student, and I could not be more grateful.
It is unbelievable how quickly time passed. As I peer out the window, green forests flash past my eyes under the perfectly and cloudless blue sky above. I am in Washington State. I am home.
My time overseas was primarily filled with exhilarating, breathtaking moments as I discovered the world for the first time. Regardless of the fun, there were certainly periods of homesickness in which I wished to click my red heels three times and be back in the safety of my own nest.
It’s a familiar feeling. Even at school, especially in times of high stress, I itch to get out of the place where I am and catch the next flight home. But, as I sit here in the comfort of my own home—somewhere I always long to be when I am away—with no responsibilities or stress (for the time being), I am already antsy to leave. Go somewhere new. Anywhere.
I’ve been home for four days.
It is a bit frightening to consider how quickly humans grow and change; within less than a year, I have gone from pathetically not lasting two weeks at summer camp to losing my mind out of boredom after a week at home. My summer abroad was even more transformative. Essentially, I realized how much of the world I have been missing out on over the past 19 years, which, in all honesty, was enlightening…and depressing.
Maybe Dorothy was right. Maybe there is no place like home. But perhaps not even home can bring the long-term satisfaction and comfort as it used to when I was a child, before I packed up my bags and moved 3,000 miles across the country. I like this newfound, bright-eyed, travel-ready version of myself—coming from a small town with not much going on in it, I would hate to become complacent and satisfied with staying here when there is so much to do and see and so little time.
Don’t get me wrong, I will always love, cherish, and remember where I came from. I also will not be surprised if those bouts of homesickness continue. I’m realizing, however, that although there is no place like home, home is not always the place for me. There is far too much adventure to be had, and more often than feeling homesick, I yearn to see what I have not before. Sorry, Dorothy. The Yellow Brick Road never looked so good.

Some of Harvard’s top donors have been swinging sticks and rubbing elbows with the president this summer—and we’re not talking about Drew G. Faust.
Glenn H. Hutchins ’77 teed it up with President Barack Obama twice this summer at the Vineyard Golf Club in Martha’s Vineyard, according to White House pool reports. Hutchins is a member of Harvard Management Company’s board and a longtime Harvard donor.
For their first round together in mid-August, Obama and Hutchins golfed with World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and Cyrus Walker, a usual golf opponent. A week later, the two Harvard Law School grads added Alonzo Mourning and Ray Allen, both former NBA basketball stars, to their foursome.
Vineyard Golf boasts the only completely organic course in the country, maintained with bio-stimulants and composted fertilizers in lieu of pesticides. Memberships at the club sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars (the president plays as a guest).
Martha’s Vineyard—located just two and a half hours from Harvard by car and ferry—is a favorite hangout for the president and Harvard golfers and socialites. Obama, who has summered at the Vineyard six times during his presidency, just wrapped up a two-week vacation on the island.
Also on the Vineyard, Harvard affiliates mixed with President Obama at the 80th birthday party for Vernon Jordan, a civil rights leader and close adviser to President Bill Clinton, according to pool reports. Kenneth I. Chenault, the CEO of American Express and a member of the Harvard Corporation, and Henry Louis “‘Skip” Gates Jr., a prominent Harvard professor, enjoyed surf and turf and birthday cake at the Farm Neck Golf Club celebration.
