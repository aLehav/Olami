After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most urban residents don’t think of Boston, with its high rise buildings, multi-tiered parking garages, manicured campuses, and concrete condos as an epicenter of food production. It's difficult to look between the buildings and see the untapped potential held in rooftops, balconies, fire escapes, and empty lots. But organizations such as Top Sprouts, The Food Project, and the Green City Schoolyards program are showing Boston residents and students the multiple benefits of urban agriculture.
As urban gardens thrive in cities across the United States, they are helping to improve nutrition and reduce obesity and creating jobs that teach people about the importance of choosing local foods. And in Africa, urban farming is also improving food security and providing a solution for urban residents who face hunger and malnutrition in their daily lives.
According to the 2010/2011 State of the World’s Citites report from the United Nations Human Settlements Program, in sub-Saharan Africa, 14 million people migrate to urban centers each year. This makes growing food in cities more important than ever before. By 2020 some 35 to 40 million African urban residents will depend on urban agriculture to meet most of their food needs, as cited in “Women Feeding Cities: Mainstreaming Gender in Urban Agriculture and Food Security” by Alice Hovorka, Henk de Zeeuw, and Mary Njenga.
But fortunately, innovative urban farming projects are finding ways for people to feed themselves. As part of our on-the-ground research for the Worldwatch Institute’s Nourishing the Planet project, we traveled to 25 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, shining a spotlight on innovative approaches that help reduce global hunger and poverty. We met with farmers groups, non-governmental organizations, and policymakers whose efforts provide stories of hope and success which will be highlighted in the just launched publication of “State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet.”
The nearly one million people living in Kibera, sub-Saharan Africa’s largest slum, located outside Nairobi, Kenya, face numerous challenges, including lack of land ownership and access to clean water. But they are thriving. Urban Harvest, an urban agriculture research organization, is working with women’s “self-help” groups to raise vegetables on what they call “vertical farms.”
Crops are planted in tall sacks, filled with dirt, and women grow crops in them on different levels by poking holes in the bags and planting seeds. Solidarites, a French non-governmental organization, is providing these urban farmers with much-needed access to seeds, sacks and training. Today, over 1,000 women in Kibera are using this innovative method to grow spinach, kale, squash, and tomatoes with organic manure that they collect from their livestock.
Despite being some of the poorest members of society, these women were among the best prepared for the 2007 food crisis. Fresh produce from their “vertical farms” provided families with nutritious meals at a time when no food was coming into the slum.
And in Soweto,  South Africa, the city’s poorest residents, who live in shacks with tin roofs and no access to running water, are also growing spinach, kale, and cabbage in their backyards. Local city governments across the country are investing in urban agriculture to help city residents grow vegetables and fruits and raise livestock.
By making communities self-sufficient, these simple, yet innovative projects can yield big benefits. They help strengthen food security and improve overall wellbeing for some of the world’s poorest people. Urban residents can also take pride in the fact that they are growing nutritious food to feed themselves and their families.
As urban farming is embraced by communities around the world, there is a huge opportunity for sharing knowledge and learning from each others’ experiences.  A local innovation that works effectively in Boston, for example, could be scaled up or replicated in other cities worldwide.
With global food prices on the rise, and the impact of climate change becoming more significant, home gardens which raise fruits and vegetables that are resistant to extreme weather and are rich in vitamins and nutrients are becoming more important then ever before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to many people, the entire literary world as we know it is about to vanish—based on the fact that a new publication of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” uses the words “slave,” “Indian,” and “half-breed,” to replace less politically correct words such as “nigger,” “Injun,” and “half-blood.” Besides raising other objections, opponents of this change argue that altering the book erases history, that good teachers already make the book tolerable, and that this decision will lead to a censorship of other great works. All of these opinions, however, are a disproportionate reaction to the situation at hand: In fact, the benefits of changing 200 words in a single edition of the novel far outweigh the costs.
There are indeed important historical and social lessons to be learned from Huck Finn; the plot centers on a boy coming to terms with the racism that is endemic in his society. To argue that changing “nigger” to “slave” erases racism from American history is to say that every teacher and reader of Huck Finn will suddenly become ignorant of the racism that has clouded our nation’s past. The word “slave” still gives insight into the inferior societal position that blacks held at the time. Its use simply encourages more people to read the story, as ”slave” is not as loaded as “nigger” and thus is slightly more tolerable to read aloud or silently.
Even today, we still must be careful how we treat race relations. It is important to discuss the history of race in literature and society, but it is a topic that must be handled delicately. In an interview with Oprah, hip-hop artist Jay-Z argued that our generation “…disarmed the word. We took the fire pin out of the grenade.” Jay-Z spoke of an ideal world, but certainly not the one that exists today. In her book “Seeing a Color-Blind Future,” race theorist Patricia J. Williams accurately describes how, as much as we all might wish to ignore race, the ability to ignore racial differences and stereotypes is tied to a position of white privilege. Currently, Huck Finn is the fourth-most banned book in the United States, and few teachers are able or comfortable enough to teach it to their students. The publication of a modified version of the text will allow more teachers to present the material in a comfortable way to their students.
In response to those who have argued that this could lead to the censorship of many other great works, I do not suggest burning all books that are politically incorrect. Rather, in instances where we do have a manner of slightly altering books to make them more tolerable, we should do so. In my public high school, we read a version of “The Canterbury Tales” that was translated from Middle English to English. I have no doubt that, in translation, the meanings of some words were slightly muddled or even lost. Like with “The Canterbury Tales,” anyone who wants to read Huck Finn in its original form can still choose to do so, while those who want to read a version that is easier to stomach also have an option.
As any history and literature concentrator can tell you, it is absolutely necessary to understand literature in its historical context. Even with Jim described as a “slave,” Huck Finn still tells the tale of a racist society. We have come a long way since Twain’s time, but not far enough that we can all move past the gut-wrenching feelings that certain words elicit.

I never thought I would welcome the sight of potholes on a road. A trip in an overcrowded matatu (three-row vans that transport passengers to different towns in Kenya) at 120 km an hour at night changed my mind, as the potholes served as a cause for deceleration and a chance to breathe a sigh of relief. With armed conflicts and the omnipresence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, it is easy to forget about another major killer of Africans: motor vehicle accidents.
According to the 2009 World Health Organization Global Status Report on Road Safety there were 2, 983  traffic-related fatalities in Kenya in 2007 with 47 percent of deaths being that of pedestrians. Neighboring Uganda reported 2,838 deaths, with the number of road-traffic deaths increasing by approximately five times since 1991. For context, in 2007,  the rate in the United was 1.44 deaths per 10,000 registered motor vehicles.
In Africa, public transportation is key to getting around from village to village and even from country to country. But, African public transportation bears little resemblance to America’s speedy subways and trains, clean buses, and regulated taxis. One must know how to bargain prices, recognize corrupt drivers, and accept that each row of seats will have at least two more people than intended capacity. Further, despite traveling at astounding speeds, an extra two hours should be added to any travel time estimation, to account for people getting on and off at random points and for the driver to get another beer or two at a local bar.
While journeying to the Maasai Mara game park on the Tanzania-Kenya border, and to the headwaters of the Nile River in Jinja, Uganda, I realized that an unaccustomed traveler is forced to adjust expectations for travel here, as everyone is on “African time,” and public transport travelers are completely vulnerable and at the mercy of the driver to get where they need to go. For the casual traveler, there is no other available means of transportation.
It seems the risks of the public transportation system are normalized among Kenyans, in spite of the fact that nearly everyone seems to have a friend or relative that has died in a car accident.  There are many factors that combine to form recipes for road disasters in most developing African countries. The ones I have found most prominent in Kenya are lack of seatbelts, lack of enforcement of speed limits, unlit winding and narrow roads, corrupt or drunk drivers, and an absence of sidewalks, which in turn forces people to walk on the shoulder of the roads. Bus drivers frequently fill their gas tanks up with petrol while the engine is running and the bus is full of passengers.
Kenyan passengers appear unperturbed, as the matatu reaches full acceleration with broken headlights, speeding around cars and people on dark, bumpy roads.  In many towns there are few traffic lights—only speedbumps to slow down traffic. The common technique for driving past speedbumps is for cars to quickly skid around them, lifting two of the four wheels.
Although there are police checkpoints to ensure cars aren’t speeding and aren’t overcrowded, the locations of the checkpoints are no secret. A car that I was in came to a screeching halt to slow down before arriving at  a fully expected checkpoint.  Some passengers got out, so the car would appear less crowded to the authorities, and then hopped back in once the car passed the checkpoint.  The car then sped off, swerving around an 18 wheeler full of petroleum. One night, a crowded van I was in ran out of fuel miles before the next village. The driver pulled over only partially on the side of the road, left the car, and hitched a ride on a motorcycle with an empty bottle to fetch more petrol.
In many parts of Africa, poverty, disease, and violence are severe and widespread.  With so many prominent problems, improving roads and infrastructure can seem like less of a priority. However, while many Americans would be ill at ease to get into a crowded matatu or get behind the wheel on unpredictable African roads, Kenyans have no choice. Although disease and genocide are pressing issues in Africa, road traffic injuries are predicted to become the third largest contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. According to a 2003 article in the International Journal of Injury Control and Safety Promotion, road-traffic accidents are the third-leading cause of death in Kenya, with more than 75 percent of those deaths being of economically productive young adults.  Herein lies the significance of roads.
An increased emphasis on the development of transportation infrastructure could have spillover effects on other aspects of life in Africa. Increased mobility would permit more tourists and more economic benefits, which would help raise the standard of living. Maybe if more international attention and government money went to law enforcement on the roads, tougher regulations on taxi and matatu drivers, sidewalks for the thousands of Kenyans who walk many kilometers on the side of the roads, improved access to emergency medical care, and better-lit streets,

After watching our peers at Princeton trudge back to school for exams just hours after the confetti settled on the new year, Harvard students breathed a sigh of relief that we have J-term. Despite the uncertainty that preceded its implementation, the schedule change of two years ago, which moved exams to before Christmas and created a five-week winter break, J-term, has proved to be a good addition to the year. Likewise, Optional Winter Activities Week, while better than last year’s complete lack of programming, was a welcome addition to the year. However, the funds, direction, and general effort that the College puts into programs for students over their longer break must be increased. One week is not enough time to do anything substantive, and in the future we hope that OWAW is extended. For this, the onus is on the College.
OWAW should be looked upon as a time for students to take part in activities to which they would not normally be exposed during the school year. Thus, it is not enough to string together a week of one-time workshops, lectures, and outings, although these, especially trips into Boston, are certainly welcome. Students could and often do make time for these types of activities in their normal school schedule. Instead, the most useful January activities would be ones that are extended, and take a full week or more; although there were select courses offered in this manner this year, there could be more. An example of the ideal J-term project would be this year’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s three-week student trip to Brazil, where Harvard students and Brazilian students were given a chance to study environmental engineering and urban planning together. Just as an eight-week summer spent attending sporadic events would less satisfactory than one spent in devotion to one project, for students who choose to spend J-term on a productive activity, a continuous, one or two-week engagement would be the best type of offering.
A cost-effective way to make this type of programming available would be for the College to encourage prominent faculty members to offer seminars during J-term. Indeed, faculty involvement in J-term this year seemed decidedly minimal. In order for its offerings to come close to the quality and quantity of that offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during their Independent Activitites period—which is often cited as an example of what Harvard is trying to create for its undergraduates—there needs to be more. Given that many such professors normally teach some of the largest courses at Harvard during the school year, learning from them in a more intimate setting would certainly appeal to many students. It could also make these professors far more accessible, giving them a chance to promote their classes and simultaneously inspire students.
Additionally, no matter how good J-term programming is, for students to be able to take advantage of it, it must be publicized enough in advance. An issue that many students faced this year was that they received knowledge of OWAW once they had already finalized their J-term or travel plans. It would be helpful for students to know of the January offerings earlier in the year so that they can work them into their holiday schedule without disrupting family or other existing plans. Some students might simply have wanted to spend January at home, and by no means should the University mandate participation in OWAW or in any J-term activities. Ultimately, the decision on how to spend one’s J-term should be at the students’ discretion, and taking away from this seems to serve no tangible purpose.
As this was the first time OWAW was offered, it would be unfair to judge the efficacy of the program based soley on this year’s results. Therefore, although OWAW did not attract as a significant portion of the student body to campus, this could be attributed to a variety of reasons such as a general lack of awareness of the program’s details. We are confident that over time, the popularity of OWAW will inevitably rise as its programs increase in number and become more appealing to students. In this vein, we encourage the University to supply the resources needed to help expand future OWAW offerings, allowing the program as a whole to properly flourish.

I think I expected Morocco to be rawer, more sunburned in its tones. My only previous experience of desert, never having been on the classic American family road trip to the Grand Canyon, was in Australia, where the earth was a vibrant orange, almost red. The shades of Morocco are more subdued—the houses are a light beige and, where the streets are paved, the cobblestones are the regular grey-brown. This is not to say that Morocco was not a place marked by the vibrant colors of the marketplace; the tanneries in particular are infused with deep tones. At a tannery in Fez, from high up, my parents and I peered down at what looked like a child’s paint set; workers dyed hides in large circular vats of color—yellow, red, blue, purple—all made from natural pigments. Still, it is fair to say that there was something about the way Morocco looked that I had not expected. We saw almost no desert—perhaps we didn’t go to the right places or we weren’t there in the right season. We went to Casablanca for the airport; Humphrey Bogart was nowhere to be found—not that I really expected him to be there, but the little we saw of the city had nothing of the romance of the 1942 classic.
The other thing we didn’t really see was Morocco. I have never felt so obviously foreign, so much of an outsider, as I did on this family trip. It just didn’t look like we belonged; there was no way to pass for local. I should say that most of my family trips usually involve our going to places where we all speak the language, where it is not that difficult to go to a café and read a book and be surrounded by people who live in that city, on their coffee break. This was something we never, ever did while we were in Morocco.
We went on guided tours; well-dressed middle-aged men spoke to us in French about the beauties of the market. We were surrounded by other foreigners, also with guides, also on tours of the market. We ate at restaurants where menus were only in French and English. As non-Muslims we were not allowed into mosques; we stood outside them, peering through their doors. Besides, Fez is the most confusing city I have ever visited. I was glad that we had a guide leading us, gesticulating beside us, because it was a labyrinth. The streets were tiny, went in every direction, and were completely unmarked. A map would have been no help. You had to be a local to get around, and as I have mentioned, we were not Moroccan.
It is clear that the Moroccan tourist industry has done well. Indeed, Moroccans have succeeded in creating this separate tourist culture where visitors are told that the best way for them to interact with the land is through their wallets. Everywhere we went with our guides, there was opportunity, if not an underlying sense of obligation, to buy. When you visited the tannery you bought leather, at the pottery and mosaic factory you purchased delicately painted dishware, and the carpet showroom was, of course, not a museum but actually a shop. With our guide in Marrakech we spent two hours in an antique store connecting with Morocco.
I wanted to visit a university, just so I could see real Moroccans, kids my age studying history and science and art. I wanted to go to a spice store in a local neighborhood and see mothers with children smelling what they would be making for dinner. But this was somehow not possible, maybe because most Moroccans live in the nouvelle ville, not the ancient medinas.
Perhaps my favorite day we spent in Morocco was when we took a seven-hour train ride from Marrakech to Fez. The train reminded my mother of Italian trains of the 1960s and 70s—the seats were covered in plush, orange and brown fabric, the first class cabins had six seats, three facing each direction, and the luggage racks were a little unstable. We were still identifiably not Moroccan, with three suitcases and our stack of western novels, but for the first time on our whole trip I felt like I was doing something Moroccans were doing. For the first time, I was seeing their Morocco.
It was surprisingly lush, but in that way of desert-like spaces, the sky seemed to extend forever, rarely interrupted by the occasional building or Mediterranean Pine. We saw dogs walking alongside children who were playing by a river; we saw cows grazing. The ride was not simply an African pastoral—we went through industrial zones, cities, and towns we had never heard of and whose names we will not remember. No one asked us to buy anything.
One of my blockmates always says she has a “little boy fascination with trains.” She likes the way they move and how they work; she likes the idea of the conductor and the café car. I, too, have always liked trains. There’s something about the conceit of the train that is wrapped up with notions of possibility. You never know whom you will run into or meet; I have a friend who says that he likes to pretend to be Matt Damon on the train, that his identity is fluid—he can be anyone.
On the train from Marrakech to Fez, I met a girl who was going to Ribat to see her boyfriend. She was in her third year of university. She spoke almost incessantly on her cell phone to a girlfriend in a mix of French and Arabic—from what I understood, one of their mutual friends was saying things behind her back. She and I spoke for only a few minutes; she said her aunt lived in New York. Her hair was uncovered; she wore pearl earrings, skinny jeans, and a Hermes foulard.
“Au revoir,” she said, as she pulled her overnight bag down from the luggage rack, and that was that. We did not exchange telephone numbers or e-mail addresses; we did not become friends. The train lurched forward towards our destination, where we would once again be thrown into that other Morocco, the one intended for tourists, sort of like the plastic covering on top of a grandmother’s couch, where you can see the real fabric, but you’re never allowed to sit on it.

On New Year’s Eve, in yet another attempt to reintegrate me, a wide-eyed “expatriate,” into my Vietnamese motherland, a friend insists on driving me to Dragonfly—an “authentic” Hanoi nightclub.
“Hop onto my bike,” she says, knowing full well that to other Vietnamese citizens my inability to ride a motorcycle puts me squarely in the same category as prepubescent toddlers; even savvy non-natives know how to work the two-wheeled beast. “If the police show up, just pretend you’re foreign,” she adds, referencing my conspicuous, and illegal, lack of a helmet.
I probably should have taken offense at her insinuation that I resemble a fish out of water in my own country. But I can’t blame her. Six years abroad, four countries, and three continents later, I feel almost like a visitor in Vietnam whenever I go back. For one thing, I’m “curvy” in comparison with the dainty Vietnamese ladies despite being a U.S. size two. Throw in a fanny pack, which I never tote, and I would be the vertically-stunted caricature of an American tourist. And as much as I fancy the nomadic lifestyle with its promise of growth and discovery, it’s still mortifying to be snickered at by a 14-year-old busboy at a hip Hanoi diner because my Vietnamese slang is outdated: “Nobody uses that word anymore,” he sneers.
After nearly an hour on my friend’s bike hoping no officer saw my unprotected head, we arrive at Dragonfly. The air is smokey from cigarettes, the music Lady Gaga, and the crowd cosmopolitan. It is Hanoi Old Quarters meets New York underground. At the stroke of midnight, we shimmy onstage in a display of narcissism that would make Lindsay Lohan proud. There, as I stand amid cascading confetti, smiling strangers, and colliding currents of the foreign and native, something dawns on me. Maybe it’s not so much about where I belong—which is in part but not entirely Vietnam—but where I will go from here. And if this grungy club is “authentic” Hanoi circa 2011, perhaps I belong here more than it initially seems.

What were the British residents like? How did the city look when you grew up? Tell me again about Gandhi and Nehru’s activism. Do you remember hearing King George’s speeches? What did people think of the five-year plans at the time? How did you feel during the India-Pakistan wars? What were the reactions to the emergency? Tell me what you remember about Aug. 15, 1947.
We’re sitting in chairs in my grandfather’s bedroom, in the same house his father bought 50 years ago, and the same house where my father was born.
It’s my last day in India, the end of a month-long stay, and I pepper my grandfather with history questions for hours about the things we haven’t yet discussed this visit. I have asked him all of the same questions for many years, but I always find it incredible to hear history directly from the source. My grandfather talks about British officers standing on street corners, and he remembers when Gandhi launched the Quit India movement at my grandfather’s high school. He remembers Bombay as a sleepy port town, where he could bike with his friends to the suburbs. He was frightened when air raid sirens went off during the India-Pakistan wars and bitter during Indira Gandhi’s Emergency. He remembers the fireworks on India’s first Independence Day, and the excitement at what lay ahead. He has voted in every election India has ever held.
We talk about it for a while, but to be honest, my grandfather is not all that interested in talking about the past. I’m always swept away by the fact that my grandfather has lived through so much history, and that his life is practically a Salman Rushdie novel; but my grandfather reads seven newspapers a day, and he wants to talk about current events. We talk about corruption scandals and the economy. He has strong opinions on who should be the next prime minister, and is excited for upcoming cricket matches. He, at 80, and like India, is looking forward. I’m the only one looking backwards.

So you’ve finished your internships, almost finished with school, and survived the soul-crushing crucible of job applications and nth round interviews with the herculean poise befitting a Harvard student. Now it’s time for the final one-on-one interview over lunch with the corporate representative. As you sit down to begin your final test, your eyes quickly scan your immediate surroundings with practiced attention to detail, and suddenly you feel beads of sweat materializing upon the palms of your hands, as you look helplessly at the incomprehensible array of silverware staring you down from its comfortable perch on the delicate puce table cloth. Before you know it, you’re back in your parents’ place staring blankly at the unforgiving form letter before you and you wonder—what went wrong?
Fortunately, the Office of Career Services (OCS) knows that no prepared student of etiquette should ever find him or herself in this scenario. During Optional Winter Activities Week (OWAW), OCS sponsored an Etiquette Dinner at the Sheraton Commander, inviting international business etiquette expert Deborah Thomas-Nininger to give a two-hour long crash course on the essentials of business etiquette.
Walking into the smoothly lit lobby of the Sheraton Commander last Friday night, half an hour early for the course, I found myself strangely nervous to meet this so-called etiquette professional. Never having been schooled much in the subject of manners, I couldn’t help but think about how many mistakes I would inadvertently make standing before her trained eyes.
It seemed to be a hallmark of the night—the awkward self-consciousness of students keenly aware of their every little mannerism. And as I stood in the lobby waiting to meet the organizer of the event, OCS’ Maureen Hilton, I couldn’t help but feel that the painting of George Washington placed ever-so-appropriately outside of the George Washington Ballroom was eying me with those eerie blue eyes.
As soon as I was led into the ballroom and introduced to Thomas-Nininger, though, all my worries immediately dissolved.
Standing confidently with noticeably good posture, Thomas-Nininger, wearing a tasteful yet conservative black business suit with a slightly more adventurous patterned scarf, exuded an aura of warmth and sincerity. By the time I introduced myself, the most punctual attendees had already begun to trickle in. Within minutes, the ballroom was packed with undergraduate, graduate, and even doctoral students dressed up in suits and business attire.
While most of the students seemed to have already acquired much experience in the subtleties of etiquette in business interviews and other situations, many expressed a desire to learn some more just in case.
“What attracted me to this event is that the presentation is focused on the global aspect of etiquette, not just which fork or spoon to use for which course—it’s about cultural awareness,” said Shirley C. Sun, a researcher at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, who expected that the information in the presentation would benefit her when she travels abroad to conduct research.
Others mentioned the desire to simply refine their own presentation in sensitive settings.
“I’m trying to be as natural as possible but also formal too,” said Chadwick E. Eason ’13, an engineering sciences concentrator planning to travel to Japan in the spring and to do more traveling in the future.
BONNE ETIQUETTE
By the time the servers began bringing out baskets of bread with butter, the etiquette lesson had already commenced, starting with the most important of all skills for aspiring professionals: mixing and mingling.
The first step, said Thomas-Nininger, is to make sure to put the sticker labeled with your name on your right breast, not your left, advice that led to a small symphony of sticker removal noises followed by stickers silently being reapplied. A modest encore followed later on in the evening, when we learned that the knife is to be placed horizontally at the top of the plate with the blade facing in when not in use.
A general point Thomas-Nininger emphasized from the get-go was that the rules of etiquette are not designed to be a labyrinth of arbitrary mannerisms, but were created with practicality in mind: for instance, all bags and other objects are to placed on the right side of your seat (not slung over the back of your seat in the case of messenger bags—“an accident waiting to happen” for the servers) so that when you exit your seat from the right side, you don’t step over anyone’s things besides your own.
Here’s another example: why do you scoop the soup away from you and then transfer it up and over to your mouth, gently tilting the spoon so you can sip the soup? It’s so that the soup-immersed spoon can gently graze the inside of the bowl and remove any excess soup that would later divebomb from the spoon in transit.
Other interesting facts: the number one reason people cross their arms isn’t because they’re defensive—it’s because it feels good in supporting the spine and improving the posture of the back (the number two reason? The room is too cold). Jackets may never be removed during a meal. Never, that is, unless everyone else chooses to remove their jackets, but that’s still a judgment call.
As the evening progressed, questions from attendees ranged from what to do when finding a hair in your food (discreetly signal the waiter and ask to have the dish replaced without alerting others to the offending article), to what to do when offered a drink (always refuse politely at a business lunch—the question isn’t really a question but a trap to test candidates’ integrity—and accept at a dinner, but never propose a drink under any circumstance), to how to hold a wine glass (hold the glass by the stem with two fingers away and two towards you with the thumb facing towards you; higher on the base of the stem for red wine, but lower for white wine because of the differing temperatures at which the wines are usually served).
By the end of the evening, the world of uncomfortable business interviews didn’t seem as intimidating.
Some parts of the lesson were discomforting, such as the revelation that some businesses keep all thank-you cards sent by interviewed candidates (“They also collect your napkin and put it into the file as well to see how messy you were,” quipped Justin L. Sola ’13), but attendees seemed pleasantly satisfied, and a large line of students formed afterwards to continue speaking to and learning from Thomas-Nininger.
“The presentation was pretty interactive, so now I feel pretty good on my own,” said Eason.
“Tonight went beyond my expectations. We shouldn’t assume if we’re university-educated citizens that we’re more prepared for these situations than people from other backgrounds because they’re always still so much to learn,” said Sun.

To thesis writers, a “Severe Weather Notice” does not elicit the same concerns as it does for normal, happier students on campus. For the luckier majority not writing—we know, you told us so—such a notice brings a wave of relief. Dining services open? Check. Snow removal outside your front door? Double-check. Quad shuttle to talk about your feelings with your girlfriend in the Quad? Checkmate (on you).
We masochists who signed up to write a few dozen pages on a topic interesting only to us (and this not guaranteed) have different concerns. The notice sent out on Jan. 11 had us worried: does “essential personnel” include the Widener library staff?
The gasp that went up around the Widener reading rooms as we all received the e-mail notice will haunt me for years to come. Working in one’s room is a euphemism for everything besides actual progress. Snow covering Cambridge would be a double blow. Not only would thesis writers be reduced to a day of inaction—a real possibility when half of each day is already wasted in stressing, reading online articles, and commiserating—but also the snow banks piled up haphazardly by plows were destined to get messier and more difficult to vault over with time.
Luckily, the J-Term inmates are not created equal. There’s a hierarchy determined by work ethic, ingenuity and arrival date on campus. Thesis junkies who arrived in the first several days of January served a tour of duty we later arrivals cannot match in experience. They learned the jungle of the library in J-Term early; tolerating the rookies is part of their veteran duty.
In the chaos of the weather notice, such a Rambo took me under his wing. He didn’t just make it his mission to determine that the library would remain open. He pointed out an elevator straight to the back exit of the building I’d walked by many times without using. Saves five minutes each way. That’s a lot of time I can spend at my carrel, watching YouTube.
Thesis writing, and J-Term in general, is about the buddy system. We second-week arrivals are just trying to stay alive in this crossfire of winter storms and distraction. The early guard showing the way are Harvard’s real essential personnel.

Driving through a rural, Midwestern community on a cold December Saturday, I scarcely recognized the place I used to call home.
My town had been transformed. Yellow ribbons adorned every streetlamp, tree trunk, and storefront. Small American flags fluttered resolutely in the front lawns of flower shops and nursing homes. Instead of listing cigarette prices, the sign outside the gas station at the corner of Main Street and Vine simply read, “We will never forget.”
He was a Marine, age 20, who had graduated from my high school a year before I did. I recall years past when we would both park in the front row—his vehicle of choice, a hulking white pickup truck, mine a tiny silver sedan—and exchange small talk as we walked the landscaped path to the school’s main entrance. I am hardly the only local to hold onto such a memory.
He died under fire in Afghanistan on the first day of reading period, just three days after his 20th birthday. Two weeks later, our community was fossilized in the throes of mourning. I thought I was prepared. I had heard the news via frantic phone calls and Facebook prior to J-term. Yet, reading the giant handmade banner above the icy state route, “OUR HOMETOWN HERO” spray-painted in red bubble letters, changed everything. Grades? Summer plans? Those were trivial matters. I grew up a little during that first commute home.
Later, I pieced together the aftermath. Word-of-mouth had recruited volunteers to prepare the yellow ribbons. Two thousand people had attended the visitation; our town’s population is only 1,817. Back in Cambridge, I had missed this exhibition of solidarity, the veterans and citizens who had lined the streets as a Marine escort brought the fallen soldier home, and the patriotic posters made by elementary school students that now papered the walls of the high school cafeteria where I used to dine regularly.
This didn’t matter. The tragedy’s impact was evident in 3,800 feet of yellow ribbon that bound a community together in grief. A  month later, as I prepared to leave home once again, every ribbon remained in place.

Minutes past eight in the morning at Universal Studios’ Wizarding World of Harry Potter Theme Park on Christmas, I find myself leaping a turnstile, long lines already snaking behind me, hoards of prepubescent children stampeding before me. We’re all heading to the same place in the distance, towards tall, weathered spires, giant archways—Hogwarts Castle. As I am jostled through griffin-adorned gates, a magical, multi-million-dollar construction unfolds before me. I walk past Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, where a station guard with a horrendously false English accent salutes me from the Hogwarts Express locomotive.
Here is Ollivander’s; Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes; Gladrags Wizard Wear, its window displays brimming messily with house robes and scarves. The Florida sun is blazing, but the shop rooftops are caked in plastic snow and dripping with icicles. In a monumental effort to keep my excitement in check, I remind myself that amusement parks are tacky, that I am 22 and have read books far superior to the Potter series, and that whenever I maddeningly type away at my thesis in my dorm room, the incantation, “Accio books from Widener!” has never delivered.
As cynical as I try to be, I find most of the souvenirs at the park irresistible. For many of the children there on Christmas Day, the expensive wands and stuffed snowy owl puppets serve as validation that they belong to a wizard’s world, or at least as evidence that they were among the lucky few (millions) to witness such a place. For me, it’s the utter simplicity of character and qualities: by wearing a Ravenclaw scarf (the store was out of them; I was out of luck), I assure myself that I am intelligent, by wearing a Gryffindor scarf, I define myself as loyal and brave. A Slytherin scarf proves the wearer wickedly ambitious.
At the start of January, I slog back to my college room and my thesis, battling unshoveled snow and unsalted sidewalks, wrap a Hufflepuff scarf around my neck, and start my work the Muggle way.

His shackles clinked across the courtroom floor as he paced anxiously in front of the jury. He spoke passionately. Desperately. Loudly.
Josh Matthews was on trial for murder.
In the opening statement—he was acting as his own attorney, against the judge’s recommendation—he spoke about how his mother had hit him over the head with a soup ladle when he was in fourth grade. He told of being locked in his room for weeks at a time. He described his prolific life of crime, admitting to everything from selling crack while on probation to punching the murder victim, a 17-year-old college student, some weeks before her death.
In my time as a law clerk at the DuPage County State’s Attorney’s Office, I had seen some criminals of questionable morals. There was the financial crimes case in which the defendants allegedly committed $6 million in mortgage fraud. There was the man who let his pit bulls loose on the police when they showed up at his door. But Matthews was different. He seemed, somehow, like a man who never had a chance. Like a man who had started at the bottom and made bad choices that sunk him even lower.
This was a man who couldn’t get an honest job, who was able to justify hitting a 17-year-old girl, and who had to be tased to get him in the courtroom and restrained once he was there. Sitting in that courtroom, I remembered a conversation in the dining hall when my friends and I had debated whether or not all people had an inherent morality, a basic human compassion. If Josh Matthews was born with that morality, it had been beaten out of him by the time he confronted his childhood friend on that cold Chicago night.
When the victim’s mother took the stand, she could not prevent herself from breaking down while spelling her name for the court reporter. While Matthews cross-examined her, however, she didn’t flinch. She looked him dead in the face, a fire in her eyes unlike any I have ever seen. It was the fire of a mother who wanted the world for her daughter—who instilled a work ethic that drove her daughter to work a part-time job and take a full course load at community college the summer after her senior year of high school. It was the fire of a mother who would have given anything for her child. As Matthews squirmed under her glare, I found it impossible not to wonder: if he had once had a mother like that, would he be sitting at that defendant’s table?

I attended my first sleepover at age eight. Granted, my mom wasn’t too pleased because she didn’t know the birthday girl’s parents and had safety concerns, but that’s neither here nor there.  By the time I was 10, I had experienced my share of play dates, quit piano lessons, and made several macaroni-encrusted greeting cards that were displayed on the fireplace mantle at home. And now, here I am, 10 years later—still haven’t played a symphony, let alone composed one, trying to figure out if I’ll make the cut for the least competitive VES class, and wallowing in my inability to understand mortgage-backed securities.
Clearly, I’ve been on this path to mediocrity for some time. It started with play dates but didn’t end there. You know how it is with slippery slopes. After “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” a controversial book by Amy L. Chua ’84, came out, I succumbed to the feeding frenzy surrounding it and decided to reassess my childhood, trying to piece together how I got where I am today. Was it the fourth or fifth sleepover that thwarted my quest to become a prodigy once and for all? Was it the lax academic standards that my parents set for me (they let me eat dinner even after getting a B in physics)? Or was it the fact that I once had a small part in a school play (Chua cautions against letting children indulge in the dramatic arts)? Whatever the myriad of reasons that have culminated in my current, underachieving existence, it’s clear the solution is a run o’ the mill tiger mother.
Someone who would have pulled me away from the camp fire at sleep-away camp and asked me if I wanted to practice violin s’more instead. Someone who would have tossed barbs instead of Barbies my way. Someone who would have demanded Matisse-like composition from my homemade stationary. I may be heading nowhere fast, but there’s nothing some tiger balm can’t fix.

To celebrate the end of the semester, my roommate Anna and I caught a late showing of “Black Swan” at the Loews Boston Common. I really, genuinely loved the movie; I found it intensely unsettling. So unsettling, in fact, that I fainted.
My heart had pounded throughout the film, but with one well-placed shard of mirror glass, I was suddenly and deeply nauseated. When the credits began to roll, I knew I wasn’t right. Anna waited beside me as I sat with my head between my knees. After half a minute or so, I stood up and took a few wobbly steps, insisting that I was ready to walk out of the theater.
It is then, I’m told, that I dropped like dead weight onto the carpet.
I came to in mid-air a few seconds later, as a merciful stranger carried me into the lobby. He deposited me on a counter between napkin and straw dispensers, and Anna brought me a large cup of water begrudgingly provided by the concessions staff. I felt like a Southern belle overcome with the vapors, with neither the elegance nor the drawl one might hope would come as part of that package. Happily, I sustained only a skinned knee, a small bruise above my lip, and a liberal dusting of popcorn salt on my cheek.
When I was younger, I would pass out as a matter of course whenever my blood was drawn. But that was years ago, and as an adult, I hardly have a delicate constitution when it comes to movies—Joe Pesci is brutally murdered in more than one of my favorite films. And, besides, I wouldn’t call “Black Swan” gory. In fact, Darren Aronofsky’s rediscovery of the body is all in the grotesque details, in blistered toes and hangnails. It’s that quotidian awfulness that really got to me, but ironically, it’s also what made me like the movie so much in the first place.
I’ve cried in theaters more times than I could ever count—the thought of George Bailey scooping Zuzu into his arms is making me tear up a little as I write this—but, until recently, I had never fainted. What a strange thing: to respond to a film on a truly visceral level, when I’m guilty of watching most of my movies through Netflix Instant View, as one of many open windows competing for attention on my computer screen.
I hope that, for everyone else in the theater, my performance served to make the experience that much more real, as an unintentional Act IV—just another 20-something brunette in the apparent midst of a nervous breakdown—or future conversation fodder for cocktail parties. “Black Swan?’ Oh, dear. When we went to see that movie”—[pause for dramatic effect]—“a girl collapsed.”
I’m sure my doctor would tell me that my fainting was largely the result of the dehydration that follows the consumption of a lot of paper-fueling caffeine and a sizable cherry ICEE. But I’d like to think of it, at least on some level, as a physical testament to the power of the film—I was transported as much as I ever will be. And that is sort of amazing.
Nevertheless, as you might imagine, I have no intention of seeing “127 Hours.”

Move over Stalin, there’s a new dictator in town, and this tiger mom is in no mood for failure (A-) or fun (birthday cards). When I first read Amy L. Chua’s ’84 defense of the superiority of Chinese Mothers I thought she was kidding. Call me crazy, but I think it’s going too far to forbid your kids from, among other things, socializing, watching TV, playing an instrument other than the violin or piano, dating, or being in a school play. And the best way to boost a kid’s confidence is probably not to call her “fatty” and “garbage” or to threaten to burn her clothes and dismantle her dollhouse—but what do I know? Unlike Chua, after all, I’m not a distinguished Yale professor.
Maybe we should scream at kids for Bs and force them to practice the piano for three hours a day, but honestly I think that instilling a fear of failure in children just encourages them to try only activities they are sure to succeed at and take classes they are guaranteed to ace. Let’s not try that harder, more interesting class. Then you might not have it your way and get the guaranteed A+, and you know what that means? Three words: Burger King Employee.
I fundamentally disagree with the idea that the only way to enjoy an activity is through mastery. Just because you’re not going to make it to Carnegie Hall doesn’t mean you can’t dabble in the oboe, and just because you’re not the star of the school play doesn’t mean you shouldn’t participate at all. I don’t think having fun is overrated, and I don’t think overachieving is a sure path to success. Go on a sleepover, try something you might be bad at, and maybe, if you’re feeling really daring, go on a date.

What could Kim and I have in common? My bunny passed away years ago. Besides, I’m not accustomed to this type of Bunny. Kim is a Playboy Bunny, at my table on Christmas Eve as the date of my stepdad’s good friend, a hopeful Don Juan who boasts a 210 IQ, claims to be the 11th best chef in Mexico, and was a professional arm wrestler.
Quickly, this Don Juan classifies Kim as “Bunny” and me, “Harvard.” Given the expectant gaze I am receiving, “Harvard” seems to be in charge of supplying conversation.
And so I rack my brain. I nix the dead pets lede. Kim’s physical assets are also off the table—it wouldn’t take a woman’s intuition to see that Kim felt uncomfortable with her date’s detailed description of her latest photo shoot, obliging my brother when he asks for a definition of “lipstick lesbian.”
If I don’t find conversation fast... I look at Kim picking at her specially-catered salad. I look at my own prawn-topped plate—and I give thanks to Baby Jesus. I hit the jackpot—“Are you vegetarian?”
Kim beams: “Yes! But I felt healthiest when I was a fruitarian seven years ago ... I could eat nine bananas for breakfast, and ....”
I relax into my chair, skeptical of the nutritional benefits of her banana intake but relieved at the ease with which we chatted. Suddenly we aren’t “Bunny” and “Harvard.” We are just two women, swept up in fad diets, and the conversation could have lasted forever.
And the conversation does, in a way, until the end of break.
My best friend, who turned pescetarian in the fall, becomes a yoga fiend. My stepmom espouses the virtues of South Beach. My mom’s friend, Nutrisystem. My cashier at Whole Foods, organic.
What’s the source of our food fetish? The media, health concerns, vanity, insecurity—at this point, I neither know nor care.
I like Kim, and I’m glad we found conversation. But of course I had something to talk about with the Bunny—carrots.

Ah, Paris. The city of love. For a single girl in Paris, this means one thing—éclairs and macarons galore. Comparing the chances of finding my Parisian Prince Charming versus the chances of my finding the perfect French confectionery, the law of probability very heavily favored the confectioneries. Forget about moonlit walks in front of the Eiffel Tower or holding hands in airy promenades through Versailles; this trip was not about romantic discoveries, but gastronomical ones. Little did I know, however, that both awaited.
My pastry-savvy roommate had told me to sample macarons from Lauderée, the original creator of the decadent double-decker. The shop can be found off Champs-Elysees, through a narrow set of pale green double doors. They lead the way to a small wood-paneled patisserie bathed in the warm light of old fashioned lamps. I selected six macarons, each perfect in its delicate, pastel colored shell. Pastries in hand, I continued on my walk down Champs-Elysees and through the Tuileries Garden. It was a crisp, blue winter’s day, warming up as it neared noon. The gold tipped obelisk glinted in the pale sunlight and, ahead, the Louvre stood old and imposing.
I sampled a macaron.
My teeth sank through the top—the pastry broke with a faint crunch, and my mouth was instantly filled with a hint of almonds light as air, immediately followed by the sweet, tangy jam within. In a few seconds, everything had melted in my mouth, leaving only the lingering trace of sugary almond paste and raspberries.
I must have been grinning widely, because the man walking beside me smiled back. Well . . . he was a very old man. Even aficionados of older men may have found him a bit outside the usual dating pool. With a newsboy hat, heavy framed glasses, and stiff wool coat, he was standing at 70-something with silvery hair and laugh lines. We began chatting in French and with hand-signals. I told him he reminded me of my grandfather. He told me I reminded him of his wife, who had passed away a few years back. It was a very unlikely match, but we were walking in the same direction—toward Notre Dame—and after 10 minutes of chatting, he offered me his arm. Why not? I put my hand on the crook of his sleeve, offered him a macaron, and we strolled down the Parisian streets.

It started with some Tylenol. We were relaxing at the campsite outside our tents in the afternoon heat. The day of hiking up sand dunes in Sossusvlei, Namibia had been long and exhausting, and our safari guide had just admitted that he twisted his ankle somewhere along the way. I rushed to his aid, jumping at whatever chance I could find to bond with him.
Manni was cool. He seemed deep, too, and pensive—one of those strong, silent types. But we had absolutely nothing in common, and so I changed tactics: I’d use my irresistible charm to teach him about my country and maybe learn a little about his. When I handed him the pills, I explained that this is what Americans do—we take medicine for everything. I was being so charming.
He asked me how old I was, and when I asked him the same, his suddenly intense eye contact shifted the mood. “I don’t know,” he said. There were long pauses between each word. “Where I’m from we don’t record age. We don’t celebrate birthdays. I was born at some point, and now I just go.”
“W-w-wow,” I stammered. “So cool. So ... different.” I was really stunning him with my eloquence. I had no idea what the appropriate, sensitive response was. He asked if I had ever heard of this practice before, and I nodded, trying to seem aware of cultural differences, or like I had actually done my research on Namibia before flying halfway across the world to get there.
And that’s when I saw the corners of his mouth turning up and spreading, as if in slow motion, into the widest of grins. “I’m 30. I was born on December 22nd.” He politely but unsuccessfully tried to stifle his laughter. I felt the heat of embarrassment rising up my neck and into my cheeks. I came up with something like, “My blockmate’s birthday is also on the 22nd?” or some equally witty comeback.
But then I joined him for a good, long laugh, and together we enjoyed the only common ground we had found all day. I guess laughing at your own stupidity is universally understood.

It is our 10th and final day in Israel and we are on the bus again, ready to be shown another historical site, like the Dead Sea or Western Wall. But today we are seeing a different kind of site. Led by our tour guide, Shahar, and the seven Israeli soldiers who have been traveling with us, we are on our way to Har Herzl, Israel’s military cemetery in Jerusalem. Walking through the cemetery, I can understand only two things from the Hebrew that was written on the tombstones: the date each soldier died and their age at death. Most of them were close to my age. I had known that every 18-year-old in Israel must serve in the army, but it isn’t until now that I realize how many have died.
Later, as our soldiers tell us stories about their buried counterparts, I think about how lucky we are to have befriended them. A few nights earlier, at dinner in a Bedouin tent, one of the Israelis, Yaara, teaches a group of friends and me how to say “yes” in Hebrew. She demonstrates how to say “yes,” which sounds like “can,” by saying “I can.” Without thinking I blurt a line from “Friends,” in which Phoebe sings, “Ross can ....” I stop, awkward and embarrassed, assuming that no one knows what I am talking about. Without missing a beat, Yaara finishes the line—“Get me the tickets!”—and we both burst out laughing, realizing that we share a love of the popular telecision show.
I then remember clearing customs just 10 days earlier with the other 40 Birthright participants, bleary-eyed and jet lagged, and being greeted by the soldiers—imposing in their uniforms and seemingly unlike those who normally meet me at the airport. I had naively assumed that all we had in common was our age. However, after spending hours on the bus, sleeping in tents and hotels, going clubbing with them, and just talking, I realize that we are really all essentially the same.
Back at the cemetery, Shahar reads a poem about the experiences these dead soldiers would never have and the books they would never finish, and I start to cry for the dead soldiers and for those who killed them. But mainly, I cry because we return to America that night and will leave these seven soldiers behind.

I should have been studying for my final, but after flipping through what must have been hundreds of different pictures on petfinder.com, one in particular caught my eye. Otto was adorable, scruffy, and had the most beautiful eyes. I called my mom immediately.
We certainly hadn’t planned to get a dog so soon, but within minutes I was on the phone with the shelter manager, learning all I could about Otto’s age, temperament, and overall health. Although I told the shelter that we wouldn’t be making any decisions immediately, they put a sign on his cage that said, “I’m going to my new home!” Hearing about the sign did the requisite tugging of heartstrings, and my mom and I felt committed. My dad, however, was harder to convince. After all, what could we really know about a dog from one picture of him? Our last dog, a yellow lab, had lived as an adored member of our family for 15 years, and his were big paw prints for any new dog to fill.
The world of animal shelters can be cruel and unfair. Animals are discriminated against based on their color (black cats are the least likely to be adopted), breed (pit bulls have an undeserved bad reputation) and age (few people want a dog in his golden years). In the South, where fewer people spay and neuter their pets, animal overpopulation is rampant, and shelters don’t have enough space or resources for the number of unwanted animals. Every day, people pay breeders for pedigree puppies, while in overcrowded shelters, thousands of healthy puppies are euthanized each year due to lack of space.
Across the country, there are volunteers willing to devote their time, energy, and money to find homes for as many adoptable pets as they can. They drive animals from overcrowded Southern shelters to better funded ones up north, foster them to make them more personable, and even fight in court to protect their rights. But at the high-kill North Carolina shelter where Otto was located, his chances of getting euthanized were too high for my mom and me to stomach. So while I egged her on, my mom began contacting every animal rescue organization she could find in North Carolina.
Her e-mails were answered by a rescue group which pulled Otto from the shelter and took him to a veterinarian. The rescue organization contacted my mom and told her that without her intervention on Otto’s behalf, and her perseverance in contacting possible rescues, he would have simply faded away at the shelter. But they also gave us bad news: Otto had heartworm, a mosquito-borne disease, sadly common among shelter dogs in the South, in which worms literally infest the dog’s heart. Prevention is easy, it requires nothing more than Heartgard medication, but the shelter was so severely under-funded, it couldn’t afford this basic medicine.
The heartworm news put a wrinkle in our adoption plans, since even after treatment, there would be a chance that the worms permanently damaged Otto’s heart. After the amount of time it took for my mom to recover from my last dog’s death, she wasn’t sure she could handle another dog with health problems.
But even if we couldn’t adopt him, we felt bound to Otto’s fate. My mom followed up with Otto’s foster, who told her that a wonderful dog rescue in Rochester, N.Y. had claimed him—they were paying for his transportation and heartworm treatment—so he was out of her hands now. Rather than let the trail grow cold, my mom immediately got in touch with the Rochester rescue, who thanked us for taking notice of Otto and engineering to have him saved from the shelter.
That’s when my mom realized she had the chance to make a difference. We both signed up to volunteer at our local animal shelter. My mom sent a check to the Rochester rescue to pay for Otto’s treatment, and a package to the shelter in North Carolina filled with enough medication to protect 75 dogs against heartworm and other illnesses.
A few days ago we received a letter in the mail, thanking us for our donation paying for Otto’s medical expenses. “He is eating tons, playing tug of rope, and grabbing shoes whenever possible. He is being a dog!” the woman wrote. “We promise to only place him with a family who will care for him as he should be cared for.” But the end of her letter was perhaps the most rewarding: “Enjoy the holidays and know you helped change his life.”
After weeks of anxiety, Otto has found his happy ending, and now other dogs at the North Carolina shelter will be spared the ordeal of heartworm. I doubt my family will ever see Otto, and once he gets adopted, we’ll never hear about him again. But something about this dog’s face, picked out from among hundreds, compelled us to help and prevented us from feeling apathetic about his fate. By taking a modicum of interest in his life, we helped get him out of a high-kill shelter and into a rescue, and from a steady decline to a healthy future. It began a ripple effect that will hopefully improve the lives of other unwanted, abandoned, and neglected animals. If that’s not a holiday miracle, I don’t know what is.

Because the learning doesn’t stop over J-Term, FM catalogues the things that network sitcoms taught us about how to be a well-adjusted adult straight white guy this break.
1) No matter how bald and out-of-shape I get, my wife will remain as beautiful and thin as she was on our pilot episode. She has to: it’s in her contract.
2) Difficult moral decisions and parenting are best left until after the game is over.
3) Sundays are mostly for drinking beer and sitting still.
4) My only available parenting tool appears to be grounding my kids, which proved sadly ineffectual in my eldest son’s manslaughter conviction.
5) My wife talking to another man makes me so jealous and insecure that I behave with goofy irrationality.
6) The one exception is the mailman, whose periodic appearances are both comedic and sexually impotent.
7) Despite my always asking for another beer, constantly making references to beer, and spending a third of every episode in a bar, nobody seems to suspect that I have a drinking problem.
8) I have exactly one black friend.
9) Expressing an interest in art, literature or politics can be mocked as proof of my own insecure masculinity by my friends and co-workers, even if I bring it up in our favorite topless bar.
10) My kids don’t have to be smart or competent, they just have to move out once they graduate for me to admit that I love them.
11) Anyone moving towards the kitchen means it is ok for me to request another beer.
12) I can replace vitamins and fruit with nachos and suffer absolutely no negative consequences, other than my light-hearted late-night flatulence. But that’s my wife’s problem, not mine.
13) My boss is mean, my coworkers uninspiring, and my job lacks any personal meaning or opportunities for advancement. The only thing worse is the possibility of my wife ever having a career.
14) If I appear lazy, stupid, selfish, hedonistic or depressingly static these are not personal shortcomings.
15) Instead, they are loveable foibles that will continue inspiring hilarious misunderstandings and dramatic irony for between four and seven seasons.

We were at my friend’s house, all of us 21 years old, sprinting in place in front of a television screen. Not your standard half-assed knee lifts: this was the 50-meter dash in Kinect Sports, and we were playing to win.
The feeling is like trying and failing to run quickly in a dream, but worse because intentional. You are trying to be fast without moving. I also bowled an imaginary ball and threw an imaginary discus. Kinect Sports takes away the physical and environmental demands of athletics and isolates the competitiveness, while skewing team dynamics and introducing the element of looking dumb. The console takes snapshots of players motioning vigorously and then plays them back at higher speeds, so that, after your inaccurate efforts, you can laugh at yourself and bask in a little irony.
Irony, of course, helps to take the edge off the sheer absurdity of the whole idea. I had strong opinions about just two things this winter break—environmentalism and Kinect Sports—and I opine that Kinect Sports is downright creepy. It reminded me of how robot-makers discovered something called the “uncanny valley,” the precipitous dip in our comfort levels in response to something that strays from caricature too close but not close enough to total accuracy. (Example: stubby, purple robots are cute, but Realdolls are scary). And so I’ve dealt with Super Smash Bros. and even Mario Tennis, but Kinect Sports do not sit well with me. It crossed over the point where I would prefer to just dash 50 meters down the street.
Every winter break seems to haul in its unique treasure. Last year it was “Jersey Shore.” Fact: Kinect Sports is just like “Jersey Shore,” Cracklin’ Oat Bran, and “16 and Pregnant.” The chain reaction is identical: you are initially revolted, you stay with it because your friends do or because it is available, you recalibrate and are reluctantly absorbed for a while, and finally you leave feeling unwashably dirty and terribly, terribly unemployed.

One was a two-year old boy, the other a nine-month old girl. The girl weighed 10 pounds. Both were HIV+ and both died from malnutrition.
This was the Africa I knew I was getting into when I traveled to Uganda with a group of Harvard students taking part in the Initiative to End Childhood Malnutrition. But everyone knows that starving children die in Africa. Haven’t you cleaned your plate at dinner because of that exact line?
What I didn’t consider was that these African children would have two pairs of dark brown eyes that watched me as I checked their charts or touched their hands, two mothers who stood by them, comforted them and loved them to the very last, and two feet that would never run; two personalities that would never develop; two futures that would never be fulfilled. These were not numbers or statistics; these were people, babies, who never had the chance to live.
But just as I wavered on the brink of cynicism, of hopelessness, I was pulled back by the group of children who survived, who left Nyakibale Hospital healthier than when they arrived because of the treatment and education we could provide—an opportunity to do justice for those lost. The children we screened during outreach flocked to our cameras and stretched out their arms to be measured for malnutrition. They played soccer with us and followed us as we jogged, laughed at us when we attempted to speak their language. They sought to show us everyday that Africa is a happy place. Its is a life as rich and vibrant as the green of the Ugandan hills, as the mixed hues of the African fabric, and as the red of the dirt road.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rene Canezin will join the Internal Investment team of the Harvard Management Company as managing director of its portfolio management team, the University announced yesterday.
Canezin will be responsible for building and heading a portfolio management team that will strive “to generate superior investment returns across debt markets,” according to a press release.
“The Harvard Management Company has a reputation for innovation and market-beating performance,”  Canezin said in a statement. “I look forward to joining their team and building additional investment capability that contributes further to supporting the crucial research and teaching happening at Harvard.”
Canezin, who graduated from Boston College with a degree in finance,  previously worked for Barclays Capital as a managing director, and for 18 years at Lehman Brothers, where his responsibilities included running the company’s treasury-bond investment group in Asia.
“I am delighted to have Rene join the team,” said HMC Head of Internal Management Stephen Blyth, to whom Canezin will report directly. “His market insight, wisdom and proven leadership skills will be great assets to HMC.”
HMC oversees the University’s endowment, investments, and other financial assets. It came under fire after the 2008 financial crisis, when the Harvard endowment plunged by almost 30 percent.
Jane L. Mendillo, HMC President and CEO, joined HMC in July 2008 amidst the economic downturn. Since her arrival, she has and made efforts to reduce the risk in Harvard’s investments, including expanding the internal investment team while reducing the number of external money managers.
“With over 20 years of experience across a broad range of financial markets, Rene brings deep investment management experience to HMC,” Mendillo said in a statement. “He will play an important role as we continue to grow our investment capability to explore opportunities in the evolving market landscape.”

A Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling earlier this month held that banks had wrongly foreclosed on two homes in July 2007, a finding that potentially jeopardizes the legitimacy of thousands of home foreclosures in Massachusetts, according to Max Weinstein, a lecturer at Harvard Law School who served as co-counsel for one of the mortgage borrowers in the case.
Weinstein said that Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank foreclosed upon houses before they owned the legal rights to the mortgages. He said that the banks were “cutting corners” and “trying to play fast and loose” by acting before the law allowed them to.
HLS students from the Predatory Lending Prevention and Consumer Protection Clinic worked with Weinstein on the case for over a year before the final ruling.
According to Weinstein, because thousands of foreclosures are now void under the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s ruling, banks will be forced to either monetarily compensate homeowners whom they foreclosed upon, or, if the houses haven’t been sold, restore the homeowners to their homes.
“At least in Massachusetts, courts aren’t going to bend the law for the haphazard way in which the consumer finance industry does business,” Weinstein said about the broader meaning of the ruling.
U.S. Bank Spokesperson Steve Dale said that the bank was not involved with the act of foreclosure or interacting with the mortgagers and that U.S. Bank was merely the trustee, or formal owner, of the mortgage. He said that the servicer—American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.—was responsible for the foreclosure, adding that there is a misunderstanding over the roles of the trustee and the servicer.
“This is very frustrating,” Dale said. “It’s tarnishing our reputation [when] we’ve done nothing wrong.”
American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. and Wells Fargo did not return requests for comment.
The banks originally brought about the case to clarify an unrelated matter, and a Land Court judge found a discrepancy—the dates of the foreclosures were earlier than the dates of the banks’ legal rights—and declared the foreclosures void. After the judge refused to reverse his ruling, the banks repealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

The Economics Department revised its concentration requirements for incoming students this past month, increasing the number of required courses and emphasizing a stronger foundation in mathematics.
The revised curriculum adds Mathematics 1a as the basic mathematics requirement for all concentrators, with Mathematics 21a required of students seeking honors eligibility.
The changes, which were published on the department’s website, do not affect current economics concentrators but will take effect for the Class of 2014.
Before the changes were implemented, all economics concentrators were required to take a total of 10 courses, with 12 for those on the honors track.
“As of this year, all freshmen are subject to a new official set of requirements which is 11 for the basic track and 15 for the honors track, which puts us very much in the middle of the pack in terms of requirements,” Economics Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron said yesterday.
Students in either track who have the appropriate high school equivalents or Harvard placement test scores can place out of the new requirements without having to take any math courses.
It is unclear how many economics concentrators will actually need to take additional classes. Mathematics 1a or its equivalent is currently a prerequisite for Economics 1010a, a required course in the economics concentration.
“I think the vast majority of kids already know 1a,” said Robert J. Kindman ’14, who plans to be an economics concentrator. “The 21a requirement may affect a lot more kids.”
Other undergraduates said that the revisions would not have an impact on them personally.
“I’m doing economics that requires a lot of math, especially math beyond 1a, so the changes don’t affect me much,” said Trent L. Kim ’13. “However, usually you have to take linear algebra as a prerequisite to take any of the more ‘mathematical’ economics classes, so the addition does seem a bit awkward.”
Harvard freshmen currently enrolled in Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” expressed mixed feelings about the departmental revisions.
“The new requirements add to Harvard’s liberal arts program and its commitment to complementing the humanities side of economics with a more mathematical approach,” said Sarah R. Siskind ’14.  “If I were concentrating in economics, I’d probably take the math as soon possible and get it over with as quickly as possible.”
Others were more positive about the mathematical bent of the new requirements.
“I think it’s great the economics department is pushing kids to take quantitative courses,” Kindman said. “Forcing everyone to really have a solid background in math will enable them to do things that they maybe wouldn’t have been able to do before.”

Influential sociologist and professor emeritus Daniel Bell, who wrote extensively about post-industrial society, died in his home on Tuesday after a brief illness. He was 91.
A self-proclaimed “specialist in generalizations,” Bell was interested in “anything and everything,” said his son, David A. Bell ’83, a professor of French history at Princeton.
“He was interested in finding large generalizations about the way the world worked,” David Bell said. “He was engaged in trying to understand the world.”
The elder Bell, Henry Ford II professor of social sciences, emeritus at Harvard, had interests that ranged from current affairs to history and from social theory to technology, David Bell said.
Throughout his academic career, Bell published several provocative works, such as his 1960 book “The End of Ideology,” which predicted that the old ideologies of the 19th and 20th centuries—those that he grew up with—would give way to new ideologies.
His 1976 book “The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism” highlights the problems of capitalism due to its strong emphasis on consumer culture.
Both books were dubbed among the 100 most important in the second half of the 20th century by the Times Literary Supplement.
“He had very large ideas about society and where it was going,” said Nathan Glazer, professor of education and social structure, emeritus, who first met Bell 70 years ago at City College of New York. “They were prescient ideas.”
Bell entered the world of academia after a long career in journalism, Glazer said, which gave him a range of knowledge wider than that of other sociologists.
“He was remarkable for his reading and knowledge in many fields,” Glazer added. “He seemed to forget nothing.”
David Bell said he would engage in deep and substantial intellectual discussions with his father.
He said his father would joke that for someone who wrote some of the most penetrating works about the influence of technology and computers in society, Bell himself was ironically technologically illiterate; he would sometimes hand write e-mails and have another individual type and send them for him.
Mary C. Brinton, current chair of the sociology department at Harvard, remembers Bell as a preeminent analyst and critic of contemporary trends in American society and post-industrial capitalism.
“I found him very engaging, very interested in what other people had to say about major social phenomena,” she said.
Bell received two honorary degrees from Harvard over the years—a Master of Arts in 1969, and a Doctor of Laws in 1992.
Bell is survived by his wife, son, daughter, and four grandchildren.
A public memorial service will be announced in the spring.
“Daniel Bell had an encyclopedic intellect, a quick wit, and a deep moral sense,” Princeton Professor of Sociology Paul Starr, a student of Bell’s, wrote in an e-mail. “When he walked into a room with students, he brought with him an entire tradition. There will be no replacing that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first major snowstorm of the College semester swept into Cambridge last night into today, but don’t count on classes being canceled or University operations shutting down.
In order to ensure clear roadways and pathways for the community, a crew of 50 University workers was on call this morning to operate plows and snowblowers across campus, and 100 custodians were designated the morning shoveling shift.
Although some individual schools canceled classes already once this semester for the snowstorm on January 12, Harvard has historically been reluctant to shut down the University. During the record-setting 1977 blizzard, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III told The Crimson that “Harvard University will only close for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”
Harvard University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said yesterday that the University will be operating normally. But he added that students should check their classes’ websites to make sure that the individual class has not been canceled, since professors may have trouble commuting.
Anticipating trouble commuting for faculty and staff given predictions of six to ten inches of snow, the University sent an e-mail yesterday evening clarifying when University workers should report to work in the morning.
Essential or critical staff members considered crucial to the continued operation of the University were told to come to work as scheduled. Other staffers, including essential staff members who can perform their work at home, were told to arrive at work at 11 a.m.
Galvin explained the University process for making decisions about severe weather. He said that an emergency services group within the Campus Services Department monitors National Weather Service dispatches for information about possible severe weather. The group shares the information with Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp and Local Emergency Management Teams at each school within the University.
Lapp coordinates with the administrative deans council to continue operations and guarnantee the safety of faculty, students, and staff.
While the snow may cause problems for commuters, it allowed some freshmen to become familiar with a new form of precipitation.
Nuseir Yassin ’14, from Israel, saw snow fall for the first time yesterday. Heis idea of snowflakes—“diamond-like objects” from movies and fairy tales—was quickly proven wrong. Upon hearing weather reports, Yassin said that he “can’t comprehend” the amount of snowfall in his new surroundings.

The number of applications submitted through the On-Campus Interview Program (OCI) has increased this year, according to Deborah A. Carroll, director of the on-campus interview program at the Office of Career Services. There was also a small increase in the number of students involved in the program.
According to Carroll, the program received 5,900 applications by the first deadline on Jan. 13, representing an 11 percent increase from the first deadline last year.
Carroll attributed the increase in applications to an increase in companies offering employment opportunities via OCI, rather than an increase in participation in the program.
The OCI program allows students to submit applications to a number of job and internship opportunities and then brings employers to campus to conduct interviews. Largely consisting of finance and consulting firms, the program also attracts companies ranging from Facebook to Procter & Gamble.
The majority of students applying during the spring recruitment process are seeking summer internship opportunities, Carroll said.
Harvard’s OCI program has five deadlines for applications throughout the recruitment period, which runs from January through spring break.
The second application deadline was yesterday.
“It’ll really be a test tomorrow to see how many students end up applying tonight,” Carroll said last night. “The first two deadlines do tend to be the largest deadlines.”
The academic calendar reform implemented in the 2009-2010 school year—when all fall final examinations were moved to December—has allowed students to prepare applications during their extended winter vacation. Before then, students faced both final examinations and recruiting deadlines in January.
Carroll speculated that students are now being “more discerning” in picking which positions to apply for because of the additional time.
“They’re not necessarily applying to everything or everything in a certain sector,” Carroll said.
According to Carroll, although the traditionally highly-coveted finance and consulting opportunities retained their popularity this year, OCS has seen an increase in students looking for marketing and education opportunities.
But Peter Chen ’13, who used the OCI program, said that he did notice that internship opportunities are skewed towards certain industries.
“OCI has a lot of resources for finance and consulting, but maybe not so much for some of the other majors,” Chen said.
Carroll acknowledged that the OCI program is not for all job-seekers, pointing to the Crimson Careers database maintained by OCS as an alternative way to find jobs and internships.
“Not only is OCI a small segment of your potential internship or job search, but it’s also a small portion of what we do at OCS,” Carroll said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ted “Barefoot Ted” McDonald was 87 miles into a 100-mile race in the Copper Canyons of Mexico when he stopped to chat with author Christopher McDougal.
A shocked McDougal urged McDonald to finish the final 13 miles of the race—but McDonald insisted on taking a three-hour break to laugh and talk with McDougal before completing the ultramarathon.
McDougal, author of the book “Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Super Athletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen,” commended this aspect of McDonald’s running philosophy at yesterday’s launch event of Harvard on the Move—a new University initiative aimed at building a community of runners and walkers.
“He’s not practicing pain, like most of us do,”  McDougal said of McDonald’s attitude towards exercise. “He’s practicing pleasure.”
The launch event in Sanders Theatre included a panel with McDougal, University President Drew G. Faust,  Human Evolutionary Biology Professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, and Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School John J. Ratey. The speakers discussed running from several unique standpoints—but all agreed on one fundamental message: going for a run should be fun.
“Running is part of who we are as organisms,” Lieberman said. “We evolved to do it—it’s as much a part of being human as walking, talking, thinking, or chewing.”
Ratey, author of “Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain,” discussed how exercise improves mood, reduces anxiety, guards against the effects of aging, and enhances memory—all of which he said were relevant to Harvard students faced with intense workloads and long hours in the library.
Lieberman said the mental and physical health benefits of running are why he and Craig Rodgers, Director of Harvard’s Athletic, Academic, and Personal Excellence program, initiated and developed Harvard on the Move.
The program, which is coordinated by the Harvard Center for Wellness, will hold weekly walks and runs open to all students, faculty, and individuals in the greater community, according to program manager and coach Alexios N. Monopolis. The first walk—which Faust will attend—is scheduled for Feb. 1 at noon, beginning at the John Harvard Statue.
The program will also include professionally coached training sessions and lectures about research in the physiological, psychological, and nutritional sciences, Monopolis wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
After the panel, attendees were encouraged to try out barefoot running and different running gaits on a treadmill in the transept of Memorial Hall.
Lieberman’s research has indicated that, with proper running technique involving a forefoot strike, barefoot running can result in reduced impact on joints.
“I always had this notion that big bulky shoes would correct my form,” said event attendee David C. Liu ’14. “But then I started getting wind of this barefoot thing, and it really made a lot of sense to me.”
The panelists cautioned that safe barefoot running requires gradual training as well as proper running form—and that shoes are vital in cold winter months.
Beyond its fitness aims, the program is also “designed to build community,” Faust said.
“I honestly think one of the key things about exercise is that it’s not meant to be a solitary behavior,” Lieberman said. “If you’re running too fast to have a conversation, you’re probably running too fast.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a little more than a week, over 100 million Americans will stop whatever they’re doing and gorge themselves for three hours straight while the Packers and Steelers duke it out for the title of Super Bowl Champion.
But it’s not just showtime for football fanatics and digestive systems across the country. Bettors go crazy on Super Bowl Sunday too, last year plopping down nearly $100 million at Nevada sports books. And that’s just legal bets; by some estimates, illicit wagering around the country could have pushed the total over $1 billion.
Undoubtedly, a few Harvard students will be watching that game Sunday with a little more than pride on the line.  But for the other bettors out there, the Super Bowl isn’t the only opportunity to catch some gambling action.
For starters, only a few T-stops away lies Suffolk Downs, Boston’s horse racing track. I went there not too long ago (purely for research, of course) and discovered a unique slice of Americana.
Built in 1935, Suffolk Downs has played host to horse racing royalty (Seabiscuit) and rock ‘n’ roll royalty (the Beatles) alike.
But the track is far removed from those glory days. Perhaps the only things that remain the same are the patrons, many of whom appear to be original to the track, and the building itself, which still houses a barber shop.
While racing season takes a few months off for winter, gambling is still open six days a week thanks to simulcast betting where bettors can wager on races at different tracks around the country.
And the best part of it all? Horseracing utilizes pari-mutuel betting, a system which distributes winnings in the same way as the lottery, meaning that the betting age is only 18.
But betting on the Super Bowl or the ponies isn’t the only way to make a little extra cash.
If all goes as planned, the Harvard basketball team could help as well.
The winner of the Ivy League earns an NCAA Championship Tournament berth, and the Crimson has a better shot this year than ever before. Undefeated in league play so far, Harvard is 8-0 at home and has won six in a row. More importantly, the Crimson doesn’t have to knock off a powerhouse like it tried to do last year.
After Penn and Princeton unequivocally dominated Ivy League basketball for half a century, Cornell stepped up in 2008 as the best team in the Ancient Eight, eventually capturing the league crown three years in a row. Harvard seemed to pose a threat last year, led by sensation Jeremy Lin ’10. But the murmurs were silenced when the Big Red dismantled the Crimson, 86-50 on Jan. 30, 2010.
Later in the year, of course, Cornell proved it was for real, leading an improbable run in the Big Dance after knocking off Temple and the University of Wisconsin.
Only a John Wall-led Kentucky could stop the upstart Big Red.
But after losing four of its starters, Cornell will probably end up back in the middle of the pack.
So despite losing perhaps the best player in school history, Harvard now has a legitimate chance to win its first Ivy League title.
Bettors are convinced too. According to BetUs.com, Harvard’s win parade now makes the Crimson the odds-on favorite to win the league title.
For all eight teams in the conference, the quest for the league crown begins in earnest this weekend, with eight league games in a two-day span. With Harvard hosting the Lions and the Big Red on back-to-back nights, two wins would put the Crimson in a good position to take the title.
And, of course, that would give Harvard students a chance to bet on the home team and share in the estimated $2.5 billion gambled every year during March Madness.
*  The Crimson sports board does not promote gambling in any form.

New York City is universally known for its basketball talent. But when Harvard travels to the Big Apple this Friday to face Columbia, the Crimson is expected to have no problem picking up the win before traveling upstate for a Saturday night matchup with Cornell.
Harvard (9-6, 1-0 Ivy) boasts an all-time 47-2 record against the Lions (2-14, 1-1), while the Big Red (4-12, 1-1) hasn’t put up much of a fight either, falling in 51 of 62 contests against the Crimson.
Despite all of this, Harvard isn’t taking anything for granted.
“Anything can happen on any given weekend,” Crimson co-captain Christine Matera said. “We’re not really focused on whatever Columbia’s or Cornell’s record is; we just know that we need to come ready to play every game and take care of business this weekend.”
Last year, Harvard swept both opponents en route to a second-place finish in the Ivy League. Cornell landed on the opposite end of the spectrum—finishing next to last—while Columbia finished in the third spot thanks to victories down the stretch against perennial Ivy contender Dartmouth and up-and-coming Yale.
While Harvard enters this weekend’s contests with the same 9-6 record it possessed before squaring off against Cornell and Columbia last season, there is a major difference this year.
Last season, the Crimson entered the matchups with a blemish on its conference record, having been upset on the road by the Big Green in its Ivy opener. Harvard didn’t let the same thing happen this year on its home court, embarrassing Dartmouth, 82-49, at Lavietes Pavilion two weeks ago.
“We did gain confidence from the Dartmouth game because the Harvard-Dartmouth rivalry is hands down the strongest in women’s basketball in the Ivy League and has been for the past 25 years,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Neither one of us ever killed the other… That generally does not happen, so it did give us confidence.”
Junior point guard Brogan Berry led the home team to victory, scoring 18 points to go along with seven assists and six rebounds.
Berry’s developing game has blossomed this season, as she leads the teams in points (14.5) and assists (4.3). She is also shooting a career-best 44.8 percent from beyond the arc.
In Harvard’s most recent matchup against Seattle last Saturday, the junior co-led her team in scoring, sharing the top spot with sophomore forward Miriam Rutzen. Rutzen had a career performance, scoring 16 points, grabbing 12 boards, and dishing out five assists.
The second-year player was introduced to the starting lineup earlier this season in replace of sophomore forward Victoria Lippert.
After the Crimson’s matchup with Dartmouth, Delaney-Smith stressed that moving Lippert out of the starting rotation was purely a strategic move to provide an offensive spark off the bench.
“[Sophomore Jasmine Evans] isn’t ready to be a scorer yet, but she will be. [Co-captain Jackie Alemany] is more of the blue-collar worker, and [Rutzen] isn’t a scorer for us—again, she’s a defensive player and rebounder,” Delaney-Smith said. “I was taking out three great scorers and putting in three non-scorers. So I didn’t have a sixth man that can do for this team what Victoria is doing.”
Though Lippert has seen a five-minute decrease in her playing time since last season, she is still second on the team in scoring, tied with senior forward Emma Markley at 12.9 points per game.
One of Markley’s best games a season ago came during Harvard’s 73-55 win over Columbia, as she nearly recorded a triple-double with 19 points, eight rebounds, and seven blocks.
In the second, more contested matchup with the Lions, it was Lippert who had an impressive showing, scoring a career-high 28 points to secure a Crimson win, 69-67.
Lippert was also successful against Cornell last year, scoring nine points and grabbing a team-high 13 rebounds in the first matchup and scoring 20 points the second time around.
This season, both Cornell and Columbia boast young squads, with each team featuring five rookies on its roster. The Big Red has just one senior guiding the team while the Lions have two.
“We don’t take anything for granted, and that’s what makes the Ivy League so interesting,” Delaney-Smith said. “In spite of not having strong win-loss records, I think both teams have some talented freshman that appear to be getting better and better each week. So we have to take care of our game and do well on the road.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the semester newly underway, snow generally means snowball fights and snowmen galore for Harvard students.
For many student-athletes, the snow has meant something a little different.
The athletes involved in the Crimson Squash program, for instance, learned that with last night’s snowfall, the highly anticipated matches against Trinity were postponed until Feb. 9.
But No. 1 sophomore Laura Gemmell seemed sure that the schedule change wouldn’t affect the athletes’ preparation and mentality going into the toughest part of their season.
“We’ll be fine,” she said. “It’ll be hectic, but…we’ll be fine.”
The matchups, originally slated for last night at 5:00 p.m., undoubtedly brought the toughest competition yet to the table for both the men’s and women’s teams.
The No. 6 Harvard men’s squad (4-2, 2-1 Ivy) was set to face the No. 1 team boasting the longest winning streak in the history of intercollegiate varsity sports: 232 wins.
The Bantams (8-0, 1-0 NESCAC) were set to take on the Crimson at Barnaby Courts under the coaching expertise of Paul Assaiante, who was selected in the summer of 2010 as the National Coach for US Squash.
Fresh from toppling Bates without dropping a single frame, Harvard’s No. 1 women’s squash team (6-0, 3-0) was also looking at a close match from No. 3 Trinity (8-1, 1-0). Bantam No. 2 junior Pamela Hathway was narrowly defeated in five sets by Gemmell in last season’s CSA Individual Championship title match.
The new date means that the Harvard women will face off against No. 2 Yale, No. 3 Trinity, No. 4 Princeton, and No. 5 Penn within a span of only eight days.
After matches against St. Lawrence and Hamilton, the same will hold true for the men’s team.
“It’ll be a very busy week,” Gemmell conceded.
But she also noted that the teams haven’t taken the break lightly.
“We’re going to keep up training,” she said. “Everyone is figuring out certain things in their game so they’ll be at their best…Everyone is on the court all the time. Hopefully we’ll have a positive result.”
Also facing potential delays due to the snowstorm is the Harvard women’s basketball program.
Currently riding a three-game winning streak, the Crimson (9-6, 1-0 Ivy) is set to hit to road to take on conference foes Columbia (2-14, 1-1) and Cornell (4-12, 1-1) on Jan. 28 and 29.
Before the storm began, coach Kathy Delaney-Smith made it clear the snow would not keep her athletes from practicing.
“We’re here and the weather doesn’t affect us,” she said. “We don’t even look out the window. We play the sport in a warm gym… [A snow day is] not even on the list of options.”
The concern, according to Delaney-Smith, is actually making the drive.
“I’m hoping and believing the storm will be over by noon, and [we’ll] give the highway department four or five hours to get the roads done and head out in the middle of the afternoon,” she noted. “You know, it’s highway all the way. I’m thinking the storm will be over and the roads will be taken care of by that point, hopefully.”

You have two days left to shop and your schedule doesn't feel quite right. Take a risk and check out these fascinating new courses to add some flavor to what otherwise could be a bland semester.
United States in the World 30: "Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History"
This course brings students through Harvard's collections of rare and unique objects, from the molars of giant pandas to Thoreau’s pencil, and answers the question that we've been asking ourselves all along: what are these things doing here? The syllabus, which includes objects featured in nine different locations, reads more like a scavenger hunt than a course plan.
African and African American Studies 109: "Using Film for Social Change"
This course explores the portrayal of some pretty complex concepts—race, gender, and identity—in film and the role that digital media plays in efforts to spark social and political activism. Students will be required to take their new knowledge out of the classroom and work with local non-profits for at least two hours per week. One more perk? Final projects may take the form of a short film or a website inspired by a non-profit organization.
English 199: "Expertise"
You know you were hooked when the title was revealed last fall; now you have the chance to become an expert on this elusive concept. This seminar will cover classic works of social theory (think Weber and Freud) and contemporary critics (Rachel Maddow is featured on the course website).
Government 1372: "Political Psychology"
This course questions why political phenomena—extraordinary and mundane—occur and uses psychology to pose answers. The class, which covers broad theories of behavior and specific case studies, will surely leave you with better explanations for our rather bizarre body politic.
English 71: "Shakespeares: Talking Back to Shakespeare"
Students in this course will be given Harvard Arts Initiative grants to craft an artistic response to Shakespeare "in any genre or media," according to the course website. The class will begin with a study of classics such as "Hamlet" and "King Lear" and biographical material. Students will later have an opportunity to "talk back"—with appreciation or with disgust—to the Immortal Bard.
Economics 1814: "Small Differences that Matter: Public Policy Comparisons between Canada and the United States"
Philip Oreopoulos, a University of Toronto professor and Harvard’s 2010-11 McKenzie King Visiting Professor of Economics and Canadian Studies, will lead the class in identifying the "small differences" in institutional policies between Canada and the United States, from social insurance programs to educational initiatives. The syllabus features an impressive list of guest speakers from the US and north of the border.
African and African American Studies 142: "Hiphop and Don't Stop: 15 Years of Hiphop Scholarship"
The first assignment for hiphop expert Marcyliena Morgan's new course is to choose an MC name and describe your philosophy about life. As if that wasn't cool enough, the syllabus goes on to cover issues of hiphop and free speech; dance and graffiti; and controversial topics such as sexuality and religion. The class—which is held at Harvard's Hiphop Archive—will be lotteried however, so don't forget to enter before it's too late.
History of Art and Architecture 101: "The Making of Art and Artifacts: History, Material and Technique"
This course, held every Wednesday at the Harvard Art Museums' Straus Center for Conservation in Somerville, gives you the opportunity to get down and dirty with art materials and techniques. Students will observe works in museums, study artists' processes through lectures and readings, and finally try their hand at creating masterpieces.
Jewish Studies 80: "American Jews and the Television Age"
This course explores the role of Jews in American television entertainment, both on screen and behind the scenes. The syllabus is chock-full of interesting literature, television shows, and movies. Additionally, each Friday meeting—designated as "flexible" on the course website—features a film or television show screening.
Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 44: "Arts of Asia"
This course replaces a midterm and a final exam with a project involving a virtual exhibition of East Asian art. The class will explore material for students' exhibitions through lectures, readings, and the Harvard Art Museums' collections. The syllabus includes lectures on calligraphy, tea ceremony, and a visit to the Museum of Fine Art.

If you're confused by the signs around campus asking "What if we had no financial aid?" and "How much fun did you have at Yardfest?", we've got an answer for you.
After a bit of investigative journalism, we've confirmed that the posters are part of an advertising campaign for the senior class gift fund.
According to Alexandre J.C. Terrien '11, one of the organizers behind the posters, the goal of the campaign is not solely to encourage people to give money.
"It's really to raise awareness amongst the senior class about the importance of giving back to a community that we've all been a part of for the past four years," Terrien said.
According to Terrien, the posters are not exclusively directed towards seniors. He hopes that the signs will encourage all undergraduates to think about the resources available to them at Harvard.
"Although senior gift is behind the effort, it's more to get people to ask themselves these kinds of questions and reflect on their experience here," Terrien said.
So what would Harvard be like if we had no financial aid?
"My goodness, if we had no financial aid Harvard would be a completely different college! Less than 40 percent of the current students would be able to finance costs, which means over 60 percent would likely go elsewhere," Sally C. Donahue, director of financial aid, wrote in an e-mail.
"The quality of a Harvard education would decline almost immediately, and even the most talented students whose families could pay would likely decide to go elsewhere because of the declining value of our education and the utter lack of economic diversity.Financial aid is essential to our identity," she added.
