After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Call them growing pains or call it a changing world. Either way, Avril Lavigne’s “Head Above Water” makes it clear: There’s a battle raging on, and it extends far beyond the realm of music. Perhaps paradoxically, a modern world dominated by sound bites and breaking news alerts no longer seems safe for wild expression of punk angst. Avril’s return speaks for something bigger than herself: a genre besieged by the bleak, closer than ever to going completely under.
The video offers a purer reimagining of angst and the world it now exists in. Casual fans of the style might notice that there is no thick black eyeshadow present here. Instead, the musician drapes herself in a flowing white ensemble, letting the wind carry her as she wills. And yet, behind the artifice, Avril still manages to capture the essence of punk as high drama. Her video is embodiment, the pale luster reifying the pure naïve demand and rebellion. Each movement is theatrically extended, each word dripping with yearning.
Punk rock is itself on the rocks, and the backdrop of the performance is appropriately severe. Avril’s ministrations carry spectators deep into the Scandinavian fjords, walking along lush grassy plains overlooking sharp cliffs. Borne of churning volcanic heat, tempered by stinging salt spray, jagged and lumbering morosely over an infinite expanse of dark ocean, these pedestals both raise up and isolate the singer’s art form. In an increasingly uncertain and outrageous environment, the catharsis of punk rock is becoming drowned out, if not entirely obsolete.
How better to respond than to lash out? At this turning point, Avril flings herself into the water, floating among the dark waves. She fluoresces, bringing about rich flashes of red and purple, before slipping deeper and deeper below. In much the same way, the genre has entered into a period of reckoning, a liminal space that seeks to define its purpose against the noise. In a new age of resentment and discord, punk rock seems to have lost its potency.
Punk angst as an exaggerated art form hinges on monotony and a baseline of stability to rail against. Today, that looks to be less and less the case. “Head Above Water,” then, is less rallying cry than plea. Avril hopes that we can return to a world of light, a world once again safe for angst.

Avanti S. Nagral ’20 is a singer, songwriter and performing artist currently studying in the Harvard/Berklee dual degree program — the first person to do so. Having lived in both India and the United States, she has performed across stages in both countries, as well as in the Philippines. Her latest single, “The Other Side,” was released on Oct. 5 and the song’s music video will be released on Oct. 26.
The Harvard Crimson: What were the musical experiences that inspired you to become a musician today?
Avanti S. Nagral: I spent the first half of my life in Boston, and would do a lot of Indian devotional music and was exposed to a lot of that. Then, when I moved to Bombay — I was about eight years old — I started training in Indian classical music. Indian classical music in particular follows this tradition called “guru-shishya parampara,” which is essentially a teacher-student mentorship relationship. In the olden days, students would live with their teachers — now, of course, that is not possible — [but] it’s almost like a sensei-master type of knowledge passing-on. Rather than looking at somebody as a vocal coach, you really just look at them as a source of knowledge and artistic power.  I was very fortunate to start working with a guru — her name is Dr. Prabha Atre. She’s 86 years old now and is still singing, it’s incredible — so my foundation was really in Indian devotional and classical music.
As years went by, I was exposed to a lot of American pop, rock, and soul, but I started doing a lot of theater. My professional start was actually in theater — I’d do a lot of Broadway and would be the featured singer in a lot of productions, outside of school. I also went to a Christian high school in India, so I was exposed to a lot of church music. So I was drawing from Indian classical, Broadway, church music — I was also very drawn towards Sufi music, which is a kind of music that draws from Islam — and combined these into my modern pop-soul sound today.
THC: As an artist, what issues or themes do you feel most compelled to discuss or share in your music?
ASN: My music specifically also draws from the dual identity that I have. I’ve lived almost exactly half my life in [each of Boston and Bombay], I’m the first person in the Harvard-Berklee dual-degree program, and so there are multiple aspects of duality in my life. Bringing them together — this rich culture of Indian music and all [my] other influences — into my music is really important to me, while creating that global, popular sound and working toward that. I think each artist has their own story, and I’d love to be able to share all the stories of all the wonderful people that I meet and everywhere that I go.
THC: In addition to music, you do work in Global Health and Development. Could you tell us more about that, and how it intersects with your music?
ASN: Both are about having that mass impact or that mass connection. For me, looking at issues that affect youth, women, global health, education is about [asking myself]: How do I have maximal impact in terms of reaching the largest number of people, not just intellectually, but also through their hearts?
THC: Could you tell us a little about your newest single, “The Other Side?” What inspired you to record this single? What was your process recording it?
ASN: “The Other Side” is a song about this idea of duality, but also about balancing that duality within each of us, which is being torn apart by a choice or many choices between two people, two places, two identities. For me it was important because I’ve been feeling that a lot in my life. And it’s not necessarily unique to my life; everybody experiences it in one way or another. My production team for this was based in India, [while] the songwriting team for this was me and another co-writer based in Brooklyn. That was really fascinating because, when we wrote the song, I was in Bombay, she was in Brooklyn, so we were kind of experiencing that aspect of the “other side.” Recording the song was also particularly interesting. If you hear [“The Other Side”], at its core, it’s an electronic global pop song, but if you pay attention to it, there are all these elements of Indian instrumentation, and I want to make those mainstream.
THC: How has being in the Harvard/Berklee program influenced your musical and academic career?
ASN: A lot of people ask me, in both institutions, how does studying psychology and global health helping you with your music or how is studying music helping with your psychology and global health. But to me, if [I] want to be a well-rounded person and if I care about being an artist who is holistic, I need to be able to have substance and understand issues at a deep level. It’s not easy because I still have the full course load at Harvard and some classes at Berklee, but I’m enjoying it thoroughly and I’m studying things that I really love. And musically, it’s opened my eyes to the diversity that is these two campuses, that is Boston, and that is the world.
THC: Now that “The Other Side” is about to be released, what are your artistic plans in the near future?
ASN: I perform a lot — this winter I’ll be touring in India — but over the next couple of months I’ll have a bunch of shows in the area. The closest one — I’m very excited about this — is at City Winery in Boston on Oct. 28 as part of the “Local Behavior and Music Festival,” celebrating women and non-gender binary persons. I’m also headlining a show at the Milky Way in Boston on Nov. 18. Another thing that I do is this episode series called #SongOnTheSpot. The idea behind it is to combine [improvisation], music, storytelling and songwriting. At a live show I will invite anybody from the audience to tell me a story about anything. I will invite my musicians to play literally anything, and we make a song out of it!
With social media today, you can have music and art generated from nearly everywhere, so it would be my dream to work with somebody from Guatemala and then somebody else from Saudi Arabia, and putting that together as something that brings the world together. Whatever that story that’s unique to you  is — whether it’s about trash cans or sexual assault — it’s about bringing that forward and showing the power of art and music.

Under the unique direction of Isaiah O. Michalski ’21, “Hamlet” breaks out of its 16th century Shakespearean mold in a production that proves to be incredibly relevant to the present and riveting until the very end. Its traditional cast of characters is reduced to just seven, which only intensifies the focus on the struggles that go on within even the most seemingly tight-knit groups. Through the 90 minute runtime, Hamlet (Benjamin A. K. Topa ’21), Ophelia (Owen D. Torrey ’21), Horatio (Janiah C. Lockett '20), Laertes (Judy F. Durkin '22), Claudius (Nick Amador ’22), Gertrude (Balim Barutçu ’19), and Polonius (John R. Creed ’20) grace the stage to tell the well-known tale of the Danish court. Michalski takes advantage of the modern medium, unique costuming, lighting, music, and props to tell his version of the story in the Loeb Ex Theatre.
From the opening of the play, the set creates an atmosphere of mystery with dimmed lights, items hanging and juxtaposed in the backdrop, and a running film of a cemetery thrown subtly on the sheets draped from the ceiling. Throughout this first scene, Horatio, Laertes, and Ophelia beautifully show the complex relationships that are shared not only between these characters, but also the rest of the cast. All is not well in Denmark. The three come running from behind the audience, flashlights in hand and terror in their voices. The horror in Ophelia’s voice is real and emotive, setting the stage for a great show.
The play also incorporates minimalistic costuming throughout — the first scene and the last demonstrate the bravado of the beautiful clothes. Within the first minutes of the show, the antagonist is clear: Claudius is adorned in his scarlet regalia. The rest of the cast is completely dressed in white, which represents their supposed purity. By staining the white garb, the blood-soaked finale shows the ultimate corruption of the entire cast. Hamlet’s costume starkly contrasts with the rest of theirs. He is the only other character dressed in different garb: gray, suggesting his unclear morality and the uncertainty of his decisions throughout the show as he battles internal and external demons.
Another example of the excellent costuming can be seen when Laertes returns from her jaunt in France to find her father dead and her brother raped. When talking to the crooked king and the corrupt queen, she pledges herself to their service and swears to end her former friend, Hamlet. This promise is marked by Laertes’ white corset. This single piece of clothing distinguishes her from superficial good.
Laertes’ return, Polonius’ death at the hands of insanity, and Ophelia’s struggles define the show. Michalski and Grob beautifully translate the Shakespearean mood to the modern medium. Truly a paradigm shift, Loeb Ex’s production of “Hamlet” showed the power of subtlety, the poignancy of costuming, and the importance of decisive writing. Although the show is shorter than its true-to-script Shakespearean counterpart, no message is lost. “Hamlet” is a beautiful representation of modern art in the modern day.

Since the release of its first installment in 2001, the “Shrek” franchise has produced four movies, multiple television specials, and even a Broadway musical starring its eponymous green ogre, delighting families worldwide and raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Against my better judgement (and the desperate urging of friends and family, concerned for my future career prospects) I have decided to attach my name to an opinion that I have held quietly for the entirety of my just-over-two-decade existence on this planet: The movie “Shrek 2” is far superior than its source material, “Shrek.”
That’s right. I said it. “Shrek 2” is better than “Shrek.” The sequel takes everything that’s great about “Shrek” and makes it 10 times more entertaining. The first film is pretty straightforward: Shrek meets Donkey. Donkey and Shrek meet Lord Farquaad. Donkey and Shrek meet Fiona. Fiona and Shrek fall in love. The movie is rife with parody of Disney and of classic fairytale movies, as well as comedy, romance, and arguably two too many songs by the band Smash Mouth. While “Shrek” may be the film that propelled ogre love stories into the spotlight, “Shrek 2” is where the characters, parody, and even the music come into their own.
The “Shrek” franchise would not be complete without the sequel’s introduction of Fairy Godmother, Prince Charming, and, most important of all, Puss in Boots. The fierce cat got its own spin off! Fairytale parody meets rom com when Shrek and Fiona travel to the Beverly Hills-esque kingdom of Far Far Away for a celebratory ball in honor of their marriage, dodging left and right attempts by jealous family members to break up their relationship. There’s love, sabotage, a larger-than-life gingerbread man and, unlike the first movie, a killer soundtrack. “Shrek 2” features hits like “Accidentally in Love,” “Holding out for a Hero,” “Changes,” “Funkytown,” and “Livin’ la Vida Loca” (sung by Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy!), and not one, not two, but zero songs by Smash Mouth.
Just as entertaining as its characters, soundtrack, and plot are the film’s laugh-out-loud references to other films, popular brands, and pop culture figures. It nods to “Lord of the Rings” just as easily as it does to “The Little Mermaid,” Starbucks, the TV show “Cops,” and even O.J. Simpson. Seriously, watch this movie back as an adult, because it’s absolutely wild what they got away with putting in a children’s movie. You’ll laugh even harder than you did when you saw it for the first time, and certainly harder than you’ll ever laugh re-watching the entertaining, but comparatively dull, “Shrek.”

No, you did not misread the headline. Entertainment industry superstar, Aubrey “Drake” Graham, was just announced as a co-owner of 100 Thieves, a Los Angeles based esports, apparel and gaming content company. Drake, along with Scooter Braun and venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, put up a whopping $25 million for a Series A funding round. This news comes shortly after 100T’s League of Legends team suffered an early exit at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship. Despite the loss, the team performed well throughout their inaugural season. 100 Thieves’ success does not end at League of Legends, though — their apparel drops, which forego the typical “gamer” look by combining modern streetwear aesthetic with premium materials, sell out in mere minutes. In addition to esports and apparel, 100T also employs professional streamers, like Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hostetter, who have massive followings on both Twitch and YouTube.
The background information here is important — not just for context but for clarity. In a world where the legitimacy of esports is questioned by so many, celebrity figures’ support for the scene (both financially and otherwise) helps solidify it as a vertical market in the world of entertainment. Drake’s financial contributions to 100 Thieves are only his most recent gaming venture. Earlier this year, he played with prominent Fortnite streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins (who graced the cover of ESPN magazine in September) on stream for over 500,000 concurrent viewers.
In hindsight, Drake’s play session with Ninja seems deliberate and calculated. It introduced him as a subliminal figure in the gaming scene. Coughing up huge sums of cash to support an organization means you likely believe in its mission, and 100 Thieves seems like a great fit for Drake. It has a “cool” factor that many other large esports organizations lack. Their focus on gaming content and apparel makes them a lifestyle-first company which just so happens to be present in esports. This tactic is what originally helped them secure funding from Cleveland Cavaliers and Quicken Loans owner Dan Gilbert in 2017, allowing them to snag a franchise spot in the League of Legends Championship Series (commonly known as the “LCS”).
Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag, the founder and CEO of 100 Thieves, is clearly the face of the organization, with his prior success and following translating into a large fanbase for the fledgling company. He is a retired Call of Duty professional who helped bring OpTic Gaming, the team on which he competed, to prominence. Now, not only is 100T competing against OpTic in Call of Duty, it threatens to surpass it in popularity and notoriety. Much of 100T’s success can be attributed to Haag’s developing business acumen and passion for esports, and apparently Drake thinks he is doing a pretty good job, too. The biggest question on my mind now: How many 100 Thieves trophies can Drake fit next to all those Grammys?

My father named me, in part, after an Elvis Costello song. I know this both because he tells me and because he shows me, a microphone in one hand and a beer in the other, any time he finds himself within 10 feet of a karaoke machine. On one particular family vacation to New Hampshire,  my eight-year-old self knew instantly that when the restaurant host announced karaoke, nothing would stop him from going up at least once. I peered through the cracks between my fingers — hiding my face from the diners who turned to smile at me as I was serenaded — but I wasn’t embarrassed. Nothing made me happier than when my father sang. As soon as he finished “Alison” he waited a requisite few turns before jumping back up to sing Elton John’s “Daniel” for my younger brother.
Long past are the days of family vacations and karaoke lunches. It is too difficult now to plan around work, school, and the unexpected responsibilities that come with adult life. When I return home, the room I sleep in is not my own. That space is my brother’s, and soon it will belong to no one. In my absence I have come to treasure a new tradition, one which takes place on the long drives that transport me from one home to the other along the twists and turns of the Massachusetts Turnpike. My father and I do not travel alone. Through the speaker we are joined by a cast of classic rockers including Bob Dylan, Rick Springfield and, most often, Billy Joel. We sip coffee and slip from conversation to song and back. My father may not know how to use Spotify — or even what Spotify is — but there’s no one I trust more with the aux cord.
The playlist on my dad’s phone grows a few songs longer with each trip we make. I request “Jessie’s Girl” by Rick Springfield and plug in my own phone to play it. Between that drive and the next it is added to the playlist. Below it is the song “867-5309 / Jenny.” Each time I hear “Jenny,” I am brought back to the first time my dad showed it to me. I had asked if he would mind if I gave out his cell phone number when a man asked for mine and I didn’t want to share it. He said yes and launched into a story about how — back in the day — girls would do the same with the phone number 867-5309. He’s the perfect confidant. Every time I get carried away complaining about someone or something he asks “Have you heard the ‘put down’ song?’” before inevitably playing the opening line of Bob Dylan’s “Positively 4th Street”: “You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend / When I was down you just stood there grinning.”’
Before the days of aux cords and iTunes, Billy Joel’s “Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II” was the most sought after CD in our house for car rides. To move the discs from their case, or take them from the car, and forget to put them back was criminal. When we play “Vienna” and Joel sings “Slow down, you crazy child / You’re so ambitious for a juvenile” my father looks over at me and says, “That’s you Ally!” Without him, I would have no ambition in the first place. When we listen to “Scenes from an Italian Restaurant” and “Movin’ Out (Anthony’s Song),” it is clear that I am the second generation of a Billy Joel song. I am the product of the hard work and sacrifice of a real life Brenda, Eddie, or Anthony — the characters of the working class Joel celebrated so often. When I remind my dad that “Workin’ too hard can give you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack,” I am only partially joking.
It is in transit, as we watch the Boston city lights fade to stars or the forests of Western Massachusetts fade back into Fenway Park, that the distance between us is smallest. Once we arrive at our destinations, his work and my commitments pull us in different directions. When the destination is school, we part ways entirely. These roadtrips are the bridge between my lives, new and old, between where I am from and where I am going. It is hard to feel complete in either one. In the car with just my father, the radio, and the highway ahead of us, I feel like I am right where I belong.

Caroline Hu has always been a drawer, a scientist, and something more that uniquely lies at their intersection. She grew up reading Japanese manga and learning about brain behavior in animals. Now a biologist at Harvard University, Hu views her skills in illustration as essential in communicating scientific concepts and has found that her comic creating has also been affected by her passion for animals. “These are 24-hour comics. Both of them are inspired by the life cycles of other animals. One of them is more thematically related with birth, and one of them is more related with death,” she says as she holds up two thin booklets. “Who doesn’t wonder about these things?”
Hu is in just the place to find an answer to her question, tabling at the Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo (MICE). The event, taking place Oct. 20 and 21, brought comic creators and audiences of all types together in Lesley University’s University Hall to mingle and enthuse over the local comics scene. Inside MICE, there are comics of every type. Some are like Hu’s zines, thin booklets or even a few stapled pages. Others are thickly bound graphic novels or anthologies. Others are sketches or art prints. All belong in the world of independent comics.
“Because there’s no one above us giving us money to specifically do stuff, we have the freedom to do whatever we want,” says comic creator Neil Johnson says. “If I have a cool idea, I can work on it for three months, go to Staples, cut it, print it, and then sell it.” MICE’s diversity of comic type and content reflects the reverence it gives to the art form.
“It’s the heart and soul of the medium itself,” fellow creator LJ Baptiste adds. “Every creator starts off drawing and stapling comics at home, self-publishing.” Independent comics provide an unfiltered look into the mind of their creator. Without corporate oversight, the artists are free to say what they want to say and how they want to say it.
This is clearly visible at the expo. Comics range from Hu’s science-based stories, to folktales, to parenting tips, to dramas about unwanted children. “Whatever you’re into, you’ll walk around and find two or three other people interested in the same thing,” comics creator George O’Connor says.
MICE also allows event attendees to engage with creators. It is focused not just on the art but the creative process behind it. “We wanted to emphasize the artist gallery aspect of a comic convention,” MICE co-director Shelli Paroline says. “It gives people the opportunity to meet right with artists and ask, ‘What were you thinking when you came up with this comic?’ ‘What are you working on next?’” The event included a number of panels where artists discussed how they deal with their own creative processes and larger issues like mental health, activism, gender, and race in addition to hands-on workshops where attendees could improve their own comic skills.
However, many attendees like Dina Bedri simply enjoyed how accessible the event was. “It’s small and quick. You can pop in and out the whole weekend. Larger comic conventions are a whole-day commitment and very overwhelming, but at MICE I can do something else with my day and still engage with artists about their work in a deeper, more meaningful way.”
MICE also provides a place for artists to meet one another and learn about supporting organizations like the Boston Comics Roundtable. This is especially important for younger artists like Tim Peacock, from Brooklyn, New York, tabling at a convention for the first time. Knowing other artists who share your passion can be a make or break moment in improving and publicizing your own work, and MICE can create an atmosphere for this to take place. “The community is amazing,” Peacock says. “It’s the most positive environment for comics I’ve been in in a while, everyone is really supportive, and the staff is very nice.”
Toward the front doors of MICE, the table for the Graphic Artists Guild of New England offers a different kind of support. “We help people get started. Comics have a business side to them, but a lot of people don’t teach that part,” Priscilla Alpaugh, a member of the guild, says. The 50-year-old organization publishes a compendium on the comics business “Graphic Artists Guild handbook: pricing & ethical guidelines,” among other activities, to help artists manage the business side of comics-making. Their most recent efforts have been advocating for a small claims court for copyright disputes. “Anybody here, who’s making images, if they’re up on the internet, people could steal them so easily. With legal fees, it’s very hard for creators to fight for their work, so we’re advocating for a small claims court so creators don't have to incur these costs,” says Alpaugh.
At its core, the Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo is a celebration of independent comics and the freedom associated with owning your work. “There’s no limit to what you can create besides what you can draw,” says Peacock. “Unlike movies, you don’t need a huge budget, it’s just your pen, paper, and imagination.” The event offered an opportunity for impassioned comic readers and makers to connect on a deeper level with one another on the art they enjoy and support up-and-coming artists in the whirlwind of the industry — to see art happening at its purest and most unfiltered.

Anyone strolling through the Smith Campus Center following a large line of hungry students will soon find Whole Heart Provisions, nestled into a nook between two elevators opposite Common Spaces. The quick-serve counter that opened on Oct. 14 boasts an entirely plant-based menu, and is Harvard Square’s first entirely vegan restaurant. If you haven't heard of them yet, you’re about to. Their pumpkin butter parfait, available each morning for breakfast, already has a cult-following.
Whole Heart immediately welcomes customers with its cheerful logo and cartoon vegetables, and the rainbow plethora of ingredients spread out on the counter are enough to make even the most stubborn brussels-sprouts hater smile.
The menu is any vegan or vegetarian’s dream, offering a variety of grain and salad bowls, street food sides, desserts, drinks, and açai bowls, making it the only restaurant in the Square to sell the West Coast classic. If a New England açai bowl is enough to make a California girl happy — and I pride myself on being an expert in all things açai — then you know it must be outstanding. And Whole Heart’s açai bowls just really are that good. They’re flavorful and creative, with ingredients you’ve never seen paired with açai, such as strawberry jelly and a creamy strawberry yogurt drizzle. If there is one thing Whole Heart nails every time, it’s flavor. The tartness of the jam combined with the crunch of the pumpkin seed granola will have you visualizing yourself taking your lunch break under a palm tree after a quick surf at Manhattan Beach.
A variety of bowls — from the Korean-inspired “Seoul” to the Mediterranean-flavored “Levant” — are the meat (pun intended) of the menu. Combine greens such as kale and arugula with grains like quinoa and brown rice for a unique flavor experience every time. What sets Whole Heart apart from its salad bowl counterpart, Sweetgreen, is that it uses Asian food-inspired ingredients in their bowls, like bulgogi style beets, japanese eggplant, and Szechuan dukkah. The ingredients are so fresh and flavorful you forget you’re actually eating a salad. Each portion of your taste buds — from sweet to sour to salty to spicy to umami — is satisfied with every bite. Good luck fighting off your friends’ forks as they attempt to steal some of your roasted chickpeas.
Whole Heart’s signature is the vegetable in disguise. Proclaiming their mission is to “make veggies the star of the show,” the Harvard Square location delivers and then some. The Falafel Dog is the VIP of the street food snacks, tempting meat-eaters and vegans alike. A soft bun is filled with crispy falafel, juicy tomato, crunchy pickle, tangy mustard, and a creamy tahini drizzled on top. You won’t believe that it’s entirely made of vegetables.
Those disheartened by the dining halls’ lack of avocados can look no further than the Seared Avocado, a creamy and crunchy explosion that melts in your mouth. Baked inside the skin of the avocado itself, this side provides the perfect opportunity to snap that aesthetic Instagram picture. If you think “baked” and “avocado” are mutually exclusive, think again. The buttery texture of the warm avocado combined with the creamy tahini, the slight kick of the za’atar spice, and the pop of the crispy lentils is a culinary masterpiece. I recommend combining the Seared Avocado with any of the grain bowls or the Falafel Dog for an out-of-body experience.
No plant-based meal would be complete without dessert, and Whole Heart offers both chocolate chip cookies and brownies wrapped in minimalistic packaging, so you can stash a few to munch on between classes. Crispy with that just-out-of-the-oven taste, the chocolate chip cookie is a home away from home. The rich chocolate combined with the (plant-based) butter and sugar grains dissolve instantly on your tongue. It’s so good you might just forget it’s vegan.

Since 2012, Yume Wo Katare, the no-frills ramen emporium in Porter Square, has encouraged patrons to follow their dreams and slurp their noodles with abandon. The restaurant has been an undeniable smash, cultivating a loyal following in the Cambridge/Somerville area. People come not just for the lauded ramen, but for the welcoming, hopeful vibes. The window is sincerely emblazoned with the phrase, “This is a place to share dreams!” It seems that this ambitious little enterprise offers up the most delicious self-empowerment seminar in all of Boston.
Yume Wo Katare recently celebrated its six year anniversary, fêted with a presentation here at Harvard from master ramen-making “members,” as well as the stateside return of the Japanese shop’s founding owner, Tsuyoshi Nishioka. Such festivities were in order, as their popularity has not waned. Even on a rainy Thursday evening, the line of hungry, shivering ramen-lovers stretched down the block. And for the most part, this enthusiasm continues to be validated. While the ramen itself is still notable, if not mind-blowing, the homey ambiance and singular experience of eating at Yume Wo Katare are what really merit a visit.
The shop is small, with enough seating for around 18 people. The space reads more cozy home theater than restaurant; the three rows of seating face directly into the kitchen, where the chefs periodically hoist thick bundles of resplendent noodles up into eyesight. A bright blue wall is covered with written dreams of past patrons, as well as two colorful numbers — 29,000, the number of dreams collected so far, and 45,000, their dream goal... of dreams. Patrons can participate in the “dream system,” in which customers are encouraged to stand at the end of the meal and share a dream of theirs, big or small, with the room. Though the prospect may seem daunting, the employees are so charmingly laid-back that even the most timid public speaker would feel comfortable pronouncing their desires.
There are just two options for food here: the $13 regular-size traditional jiro ramen, and the $15 buta, a larger bowl of the same ramen with extra pork. The ramen comes out quickly, to one row at a time, but not before the chef makes eye contact with each individual down the banquet and asks, “Delicious garlic?” One would be remiss to decline. The accurately named delicious garlic adds refreshing sweetness to what is a truly hefty bowl of ramen; this big-stomached reporter struggled to finish the regular. The part of their philosophy stating that “if you can finish a bowl of ramen here, you can do anything” rings very true. Each serving contains an ample helping of house-made noodles under thick slabs of pork, topped with pork fat and a copious smattering of cabbage and bean sprouts. The pork is rather chewy, and perhaps unnecessarily salty, but still stands out well against a broth that packs a flavorful punch. The noodles are the highlight — sumptuous and tangy, with a satisfying bite and a pleasingly absorptive flavor. Their suppleness helps to undercut any toughness in the pork.
Without much variety in the spice notes, the bowl becomes a bit of a slog to get through after a certain point, more so even than a classic case of ramen fatigue. But the experience is buoyed by the occasional dream-sharer, who, after having their finished bowl declared an “almost,” a “good job,” or a “perfect” by a friendly employee, pops out of their seat and opens their heart to a group of strangers.
Indeed, having a meal here is about more than food. Yume Wo Katare has built a collective community of support in Porter Square, an ethos of love that imbues the space with ebullient positivity. It’s hard not to have a good time when the entire joint is predicated on lifting one another up and warming the bones with ramen. Above a swooping, hand-painted “Yume Wo Katare,” the restaurant’s sign reads “until 2030.” Yet after just one meal here, it is easy to imagine this cheeky community of dreamers keeping its doors open for much longer.

2018 marks the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley’s novel, “Frankenstein.” In celebration, on Oct. 26, the Mahindra Humanities Center put on “The Afterlives of Frankenstein” in the Barker Center. This event featured multiple panels filled with various academics with extensive knowledge on both the novel and its cultural significance post-publication that extends to a present day sociopolitical context.
The panels consisted of multiple professors and fellows who used film to help illustrate their interpretations and analysis of the novel and to describe how “Frankenstein”’s 19th century themes map out many current day social phenomena. James Chandler, Professor of English at the University of Chicago, used a clip from the 2004 series adaptation of “Frankenstein,” in which Victor Frankenstein sets his monster’s female companion on fire, to help present the notion of the discourse of sympathy within monsters and humans.
Moira G. Weigel, a post-doctoral member of the Harvard Society of Fellows, presented a clip from the 1968 film “Rosemary’s Baby” to depict how Frankenstein’s terror mirrors what she calls “mommy horror.” The clip showed the main character, Rosemary, reacting similarly to how Henry Frankenstein does after he creates his monster in the novel. Rosemary exclaims, “It’s alive! It’s alive!”
“It really struck me going back to the novel how much it just does seem to be about loss and pregnancy loss and these forms of grief that we don’t necessarily talk about,” Weigel said when discussing the movie’s connection to “Frankenstein.” “How do we use that to think about this current moment and these sort of structural issues?” Some members of the audience also felt that film and the novel were deeply intertwined.
“I think the approach of thinking about cinema and the novel was really innovative and provocative, and so that made me think about the novel not singularly, but in context and conversation with cinematic representations,” said Margaret J. Rhee, a Harvard College Fellow in the English Department.
This event has been in the making for over a year. Deidre Lynch, Professor of English literature at Harvard, said, “It would be hard to name a book that has had more impact on the way we think about humanity, about beauty and ugliness, about science, about race, so it seems such an important novel that it seemed as if we should commemorate its bicentennial.” When asked about her opinion on how “Frankenstein” has held such a strong influence over society in its 200 year history, she explained that, “It seems topical for every new generation that comes to it.” She cited its thematic parallels to ecological destruction, eugenics, and family.
Students can engage in reading and learning about Mary Shelley’s novel through multiple opportunities: On Halloween day, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., there will be a marathon reading of the entire novel, followed by a demonstration of the scientific experiments of the age of the novel’s publication at 4:30 p.m. in Science Center Hall B. There will also be a Frankenstein film screening at the Harvard Film Archive, where undergraduate students receive free admission. For those who want a relaxed experience with one of the most historically iconic horror novels, consider revisiting the writing of Mary Shelley for the chills!

In an event on Oct. 23, Director of Digital Infrastructure and Emerging Technology at Harvard Art Museums Jeff Steward revealed that the museum staff uses a surprising method to classify their massive art collection: artificial intelligence. With a collection of over 250,000 pieces, the museum is looking for a more efficient way to categorize their art, and as a result, make art more accessible to a wider audience. The goal, Steward said, is to find “a new way to engage people with art collections who just might not have a way in.”
How does using artificial intelligence do this? Steward said that the answer lies in using AI to describe the artwork without any other context besides the work itself. “[The AI] are forced to just tell me what they see. It’s like someone going to the museum for the first time,” Steward said. This process humanizes the cataloging process by describing the artwork in terms more similar to what an average person, instead of an expert, might use.
“I’m not interested in training machines to think like I do,” Steward said. “I want to know what they think on their own, unpainted by the art history, art appreciation perspective.” The goal is to eventually use these AI-generated descriptions as keywords or search terms for people searching for art on Harvard’s databases.
To demonstrate how exactly this process is done, Steward started by introducing some basic terminology to the audience, including definitions of “machine processing,” “computer vision,” and “artificial intelligence.” He spent the rest of the talk showing examples of pieces of art from the Harvard Art Museums collection and how four different image recognition AI softwares — Microsoft Cognitive Services, Google Vision, Clarifai, and Imagga — describe the art.
One such example is of the painting “Random Patterns” by Hungarian painter Gyorgy Kepes. Google Vision described the work with terms such as “art, wall, modern art, wood, texture, artwork, tree,” while Microsoft Cognitive Services used terms such as “dirty,” “painting,” and most interestingly, “a bathroom with graffiti on the wall.” Each term was often associated with a numerical value of up to 1.00, indicating the AI’s confidence level in the accuracy of its description. Another painting of “Still Life with Watermelon” by Sarah Miriam Peale was described as “cake with fruit on the table” by Microsoft Cognitive Services, “citrillus” by Google Vision, “no person 99.0 percent” by Clarifai, and “juicy” by Imagga. Steward noted how Imagga’s descriptions of “juicy,” “sweet,” and “delicious” show the AI’s ability to suggest the benefits or sensations one might experience from eating the fruit.
The event in Cabot Library attracted audience members of different ages and backgrounds. Robin G. McElheny, an archivist for the Harvard University archives, said she was inspired to attend the event because it relates to her own work in the archives.
“I’m always interested in finding out about new ways to work with image collections, whether it’s using artificial intelligence to catalog them or to provide new ways of accessing the collections,” McElheny said. “Although it’s easy to laugh at the descriptions the machines create, it does pique one’s interest to look at the image and find out more.”
Another attendee, Reynor J. Huang, is currently working as a software engineer in Boston and spoke to the intersection of technology and art in context of the talk.
“A lot of the time it’s tech people trying to apply [concepts] to the humanities, so it’s really cool to have the humanities side trying to look at it in terms of tech,” Huang said.
“What Do Machines See When They Look at Art?” provided audience members with a look into the novel applications of computer vision and article intelligence. Through the use of these tools, Harvard Art Museums is working to bring new perspectives to artwork and enable it to reach a greater number of people.

It was always going to be hard to remake “Suspiria.” The 1977 film, directed by horror master Dario Argento, is remarkable not for its plot — a dance academy in Berlin is secretly a coven of witches — but for its visual style, featuring lush, expressive colors and impressionistic mise-en-scène. Luca Guadagnino’s new version takes a very different approach, muting the color palette but adding a host of new elements, themes, and twists. The result is a film that is just as rich and entrancing as the original, in an entirely new way.
The director’s first decision may have been his best: getting the right people involved. Tilda Swinton commands the film as both the imperious Madame Blanc, the head of the dance studio, and Dr. Josef Klemperer, a psychoanalyst who gets wrapped up in the coven’s diabolic dealings. Dakota Johnson stars as the protagonist, Sophie Bannion, a seemingly naïve Mennonite girl who comes from America to study at the studio — an excellent match for her combination of innocence and haughtiness, which was so underserved in the “Fifty Shades” trilogy. It’s not just actors, either: The haunting, atmospheric music that hangs over the film is the product of Thom Yorke, frontman of Radiohead.
Guadagnino may not, at first glance, appear to be a natural fit for a film like “Suspiria.” Known in the U.S. primarily for having directed “Call Me By Your Name,” a vibrant, summery romance in the Italian countryside, for his next film to be a supernatural psychological horror film may seem like a jump. However, two aspects of his previous effort do carry through: his interest in sexuality and, especially, his ability to capture the body on film.
This skill comes in handy in “Suspiria,” as Guadagnino chooses to correct a missed opportunity in the original: He actually depicts his actors and actresses dancing. Dance is central to the magic of the witches and of the film. In one shocking intercut sequence, Sophie unknowingly destroys a classmate through dance, magically throwing the girl around a room and contorting her body in horrific ways. Due to its inherent dynamism, dance can be incredibly difficult to depict well, but Guadagnino more than succeeds, cutting back and forth with grace from wider shots encapsulating the full figure to close ups that isolate a particular body part. With so many different shots in such short sequences, it can be easy to disorient the audience, but Guadagnino manages to keep the viewer grounded.
The richness in the editing exists not only in the dance sequences, but throughout the film. In an early scene, another of the dance students, Patricia (Chloë Grace Moretz), flops down into a chair in Josef’s office. In the course of that short action, Guadagnino uses four or five different shots at varying angles. This style allows him to grant a specificity to the action of the film — he can communicate what this particular person sitting in this chair at this time feels like. To aid in this endeavor, he uses a wide variety of camera movements: sometimes swooping through the air, sometimes still, sometimes creeping slowly forwards or backwards. One standout shot — a likely reference to the 1948 classic “The Red Shoes” — spins the camera to mimic Sophie’s own turns, pausing only briefly in an imitation of spotting technique. The movement and music build in unison, tension rising until the sequence climaxes with the first meeting between Sophie and Madame Blanc.
The intense political, historical, and psychoanalytical themes in “Suspiria” — missing from the original — create an interrelated web of symbolism throughout the film. The film is set against the backdrop of the German Autumn, the violent actions of far-left political groups in late 1977, while also looking back towards the Holocaust, and exploring ideas of guilt, innocence, and memory in relation to that tragedy. Josef’s job as a psychoanalyst introduces a new lens through which to read the film as well, along with a reference to French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. And — almost out of necessity, given the nearly all-female cast — “Suspiria” is a deeply and complexly feminist film, full of yonic imagery and completely devoid of the species of simple, “Yay! Go women!” feminism of Hollywood films like “Ocean’s 8.”
While fans of Argento’s original “Suspiria” may miss his totalizing palette (although there are moments of it, especially in the climax of the film), they should not be disappointed in Guadagnino’s remake. Clocking in at nearly a full hour longer, the modern “Suspiria” expands in every possible way upon the original, adding intricacy and thematic depth that Argento’s version lacked. Argento’s “Suspiria” is rightfully a classic, but in his remake, Guadagnino has done far more with the same premise.

The Harvard College Musical theater brought all that jazz to Harvard with its production of the beloved Broadway musical, “Chicago.” Through its spot-on casting, talented orchestra players, and professional choreography, HCMT made it clear that “Chicago” deserves its place in the hearts of musical theater aficionados.
The jazz-fueled musical follows Roxie Hart (Annabel O’Hagan ’19), a lovable aspiring star who finally gets the chance to take the spotlight through somewhat unconventional means — the murder of her illicit lover. With the help of her pitifully devoted husband Amos (Ethan Craigo ’19), a smooth-talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Kyler Chase ’19), a conniving prison warden “Mama” Morton (Genevieve Lefevre ’20), and her frenemy Velma Kelly (Ashley M. LaLonde ’20), Roxie discovers a variety of tactics to make the trial go her way. This means more than just getting a “not guilty” verdict, as Roxie’s biggest focus is simply getting attention. The enthralling plot and catchy tunes have made “Chicago” an extremely popular show, leading to multiple revivals and even a 2002 Academy Award-winning film of the same name.
HCMT’s take on Broadway’s longest running American musical does not diverge too greatly from typical productions. The set is minimal, the costumes are practically underwear, and the spotlights are practically main characters. However, there are a few key differences that affect the overall tone of the show. The show completely changes the character Mary Sunshine and her subplot. In most versions of the show, Sunshine is played by a man with a very impressive falsetto range, which is showcased when Flynn removes her wig during the trial. This scene is usually played for laughs, but could only add a layer of transphobia to an otherwise delightful show. As such, director Ryan T. Kapur ’20 decided to remove these aspects of the character, instead framing her as an ordinary reporter played by Allison Toledo ’19. Kapur certainly made the right call, but it begs the question of whether the character even needs to be included.
Another major change was the location of the pit. “Chicago” is unique in that it often features a visible jazz band, which helps invoke the atmosphere of a 1920s jazz club. By putting the musicians front and center, and featuring numerous vocalless overtures, viewers are treated to two shows in one — a plot-driven musical and a stunning jazz performance. HCMT, however, placed the band in its usual, invisible location below the stage. This detracted from what is one of the most enjoyable experiences of seeing this musical in particular, and it relegated the hard working musicians to the sidelines. Considering the great talent of HRDC’s pit, this was a disappointing move.
Thankfully, the production excelled in every other department. First and foremost, O’Hagan stole the show. It is delightful to see a Roxie that can sing so beautifully while also effectively showcasing the character’s fiery personality. Perhaps just as delightful is the casting of Velma. LaLonde’s Velma perfectly complements O’Hagan’s Roxie. In fact, though some casting choices seemed unusual at first — Lefevre’s Mama was certainly not a belter, and Craigo’s Amos is far from plain — every single performer justified their place on stage with fantastic singing and equally engaging acting.
Of course, “Chicago” is about a lot more than just singing and acting. True to its focus on 1920s Vaudeville stars, dancing plays an especially important role in the musical. The choreography for this production, uniquely created by Kapur himself, was at a professional level. A variety of 1920s dance styles were represented, from the memorable chair dance in “Cell Block Tango” to Amos’ adorably simple jazz hands in “Mr. Cellophane.” While certainly honoring Bob Fosse’s legacy, Kapur’s choreography stood out in its own right, certainly helped by the performers’ adeptness in enacting it.
“Chicago” is a particularly difficult musical to put on successfully, as the numerous Broadway productions and the movie set expectations particularly high. Though not without flaw, HCMT’s productions met these expectations and more, providing a much needed break from reality through the delights of jazz, liquor, and semi-justified murder. One can only imagine the great skill required to act, sing, and dance in front of a huge crowd, all while wearing lingerie.
Correction: Nov. 2, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club produced this verison of "Chicago." In fact, Harvard College Musical Theater produced it.

 Over the last couple of years, Netflix has squeezed small-screen content out of almost every cultural access point imaginable. Their newest wheelhouse, it seems, is cooking — not the “Top Chef” shows of yore, but rather high-production, globetrotting enterprises, serving up everything from mini-biographies of acclaimed chefs (“Chef’s Table”) to docuseries of affable American dudes eating their way around the world (“Somebody Feed Phil”). “Salt Fat Acid Heat” is yet another gorgeous Netflix food show. Still, it somehow manages to carve its own niche in a well-worn genre. This is Food Network for the highbrow visual consumer, instructional television delivered in a sumptuous, vaguely narrative package. No matter how fed up one has become with the Netflix content machine, “Salt Fat Acid Heat” is hard to hate.
Based on Samin Nosrat’s acclaimed cookbook of the same name, the show follows Nosrat through Italy, Japan, Mexico and California as she seeks to define good cooking by the mastery of the eponymous four simple properties. The premise here — that in each country Nosrat is embraced by her established network of friendly artisans, who introduce her to the rich traditions of local parmesan, miso, or Yucatán honey — would read as classic American cultural colonialism if Nosrat weren’t so warmly charming and decidedly unpretentious. An alum of famed Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, the chef expresses every inch of her love for flavor in her grinning face. She is ridiculously fun to watch — in the first episode, the camera catches her from all angles as she crunches on some homemade focaccia bread and simultaneously exhibits the full spectrum of human pleasure.
What makes Nosrat such a compelling candidate for the people’s chef is her willingness to be imperfect. In “Acid,” she readily admits that she is not great at shaping homemade tortillas. In a relatively climactic unveiling of her classic at-home roasted chicken in “Heat,” she pulls out an unevenly cooked bird, then simply explains the problem, adjusts its placement in the oven, and jovially carries on with the meal. Nosrat is a wide-eyed, millennial Martha Stewart. Her kitchen is a safe space, and her teaching is never overly didactic. We learn with her, not from her. The thesis here is somewhat radical: The rudiments of home cooking deserve as much production value as James Beard award-winning chefs.
Indeed, the cinematography is spellbinding, and certainly worthy of a Netflix budget. There are, of course, the requisite rolling Italian vistas, the glistening California architecture, the bustling Japanese markets, as well as the boiling vats of pasta, a juicy squeeze or two of citrus. But the real star of each shot is always Nosrat’s exquisitely powerful hands, as she kneads dough or arranges veggies just so on a roasting platter.
Nosrat never gets political, but she knows what her show represents. Her Iranian heritage casually but consciously imbues her experiences with a distinct perspective, in cooking and otherwise. In “Acid,” she describes putting yogurt on everything as a child to cut the high natural acidity in Persian food. In the final episode, she invites her mother to come help her make tahdig, a traditional Persian dish, for a dinner party. And in a charmingly illustrated aside, she describes the foundational experience of eating her first Thanksgiving dinner with a white friend’s family, and heaping tart cranberry sauce on the bland turkey and stuffing in an effort to make it palatable. She is a classic American chef — on her own terms.
Nosrat’s chef persona is defined by a generosity of spirit, and each episode ends accordingly with a cozy dinner party. “Cooking has never been about the food,” she reminds us in voice-over. “It’s about what happens at the table.” She is preaching the gospel of home cooking — the beauty of just a few simple ingredients, prepared well, shared with good friends. Miraculously, her sincerity manages to convey this trite message in a truly poignant way. And soul-nourishing food makes for soul-nourishing TV.
With Nosrat as self-help protagonist and cooking instructor, “Salt Fat Acid Heat” does manifest as more of an author’s book talk than full-fledged documentary television. That the show is structured episodically according to chapters of its source text does nothing to undercut the lingering feeling that Nosrat is basically taking us on a live-action, anecdotal tour of her cookbook.
Yet the show is delightful, and certainly merits a watch on its own. The question then becomes whether the cookbook itself, and future such projects, will still merit a read. Why read a book, one might wonder, when you can watch a TV show that has all the information and more? It is somewhat startling to consider, but as Netflix continues to blur its definition of television, its tentacles are working to conglomerate all consumable avenues of culture into swaths of mega-media — comprehensive daily talk shows, serial sagas with novelistic tendencies, visual cookbooks. Sure, this maximalist approach can produce gorgeous multimedia works of great complexity.
But we also run the risk of losing what makes individualized media special. If “Salt Fat Acid Heat” is a souped-up visual cookbook, then what becomes of the real cookbook? Of any cookbook? One can only hope that these underdog media manage to chug along in the looming shadow of an ever-present Netflix budget, ready and willing to snap them up and churn them out.

As I waited for my mom to answer the phone, I practiced several different ways to tell her that I was dying.
Ring.
“Tengo algo que decirte…”
Ring.
“Espero que algún día puedas entender…”
Ring.
“I’m really sorry that it has to be this way.”
No answer. She must still be on her shift at McDonald’s, I figured. Students made their way on and off the subway train as we left Metro Center Station. I thought of my mother’s stories of commuting to and from school in camionetas back home. As the last of the students trickled in, my attention shifted away from the subway car.
***
Clutching the knife that she kept hidden in her pocket, Esperanza kept her head down and made her way onto the bus. The bright red and yellow colors of the camioneta, one of the retired American school buses which her country used for public transportation, danced vibrantly behind her against the poorly lit city streets. As she boarded, she stopped to examine the monstrous vehicle which would eventually take her home. “Dios es Amor” had been painted on the side of the camioneta in bright red, in hopes that the words would keep the bus’s driver safe. To Esperanza, however, the phrase looked like it had been written in blood.
A chill ran down her spine as she handed 50 centavos to the bus driver. Spotting an open seat next to an elderly woman carrying a pack of tortillas on her lap, Esperanza made her way towards the center of the bus. She shot the woman a brief smile as she sat down, and pulled out a notebook, a pencil, and a second-hand textbook — Dennis M. Ritchie’s “The C Programing Language, Second Edition”— from her bag.
“Notice that the type being declared in a typedef appears in the position of a variable name, not right after the word typedef. Syntactically, typedef is like the storage classes extern, static, etc.”
Esperanza underlined the word “syntactically.” She paused for a moment, holding the tip of the pencil between lips, and then wrote its Spanish equivalent in the margins of her textbook: sintácticamente. In her notebook, she painstakingly began to write out each line of code from the unit’s exercises.
“This would be so much easier if I had a computer,” Esperanza reminded herself. Eyeing the stich marks on the back of her left heel, she sighed and continued. Esperanza flipped through her notebook and smiled to herself as she finished, satisfied that she had managed to complete most of the assignment during her after school job as a secretary in her university’s administrative center. The satisfaction lasted for only a moment, however, as a ring of anxiety began to form in her stomach and find its way into her heart. Twisting her fingers together, Esperanza prayed that the program would run when she compiled it on the school computers the next morning. If not, she would be forced to take another zero on the assignment. Being the only student who could not afford a computer at her university had taken its toll on her grades. Still, she was happy to be able to receive an education.
***
Esperanza was only one bus stop away from home when the men with guns boarded the camioneta. It had all happened so quickly that Esperanza barely had time to react. She was still wondering whether her program would run the next morning, when her thoughts were interrupted by the screams that began to ring through the air.
“¡Esto es un asalto!”
Esperanza reached for her knife but was paralyzed in fear as one of the men approached her and the elderly woman next to her. Without saying a word, the man reached for Esperanza’s backpack and the elderly woman’s bag of tortillas. Instinctively, her body lurched forward in protest, but a voice inside her head reminded her that her life was worth more than her books. After another second, one of the men yelled something unintelligible to rest of the group and they scurried off of bus with everyone’s belongings.
Everyone sat in shock for several minutes. Then, the bus driver continued on his route as though nothing had happened. Esperanza noted that the bus driver’s knapsack remained undisturbed under his seat — he must have been in on it, she thought.
As she made her way off the bus at her stop, Esperanza reached for the knife in her pocket, and accidentally nicked her finger on its blade. She held it up to to inspect in the moonlight. The blood matched the crimson lettering on the bus in front of her perfectly: “Dios es Amor.” Esperanza wiped the tears from her face, her body trembling as she struggled to remember the way home.
***
As I reached into my backpack, I felt something sharp stab my finger. Shaking it to dull the pain, I searched for the perpetrator and pulled out a mechanical pencil whose lead I had failed to retract. Even under the dull, yellow light of the subway car, the gleam of the lead seemed to resemble that of a knife. I took a moment to examine the dark mark the pencil had left on my finger before pulling out a notebook and beginning to write on the last page. I had finally figured out how to say goodbye to my mother. I wrote frantically as the train car doors opened for Farragut North Station, only a block away from the White House. As I finished, I noticed that the white man seated next to me was staring in horror at words I had written. He shot me a glance filled with revulsion as he exited the car. Noting the American flag pin on the lapel of his jacket, I smiled in quiet satisfaction.

Everyone visits Neverland sometimes. The idyllic landscape of childhood resides in the most obscure folds of our memories, but when we find it, bittersweet nostalgia can come back to comfort as well as to haunt. Four years after her debut album, “No Mythologies to Follow,” Karen Marie Aagaard Ørsted Andersen, better known as MØ, has graced us with “Forever Neverland,” in which she continues to explore the struggle of reconciling the past with a world that moves too quickly into the future.
The album is a walk down memory lane with no direction, a tale of turmoil between growing older and growing up. It reflects the chaos of life with a collection of songs just as messy and amazing. In the end, there's not much to learn but everything to experience.
Each song contributes a part to a deep narrative, starring MØ or a fictional protagonist and delving into both their past and how they reflect on it. Beginning in young adulthood, each song exemplifies confusion. The frantic pessimism of “Way Out” and reluctant feelings in “I Want You” ultimately culminate in “Blur.” Melancholic instrumentals set the backdrop to dispiriting lyrics, and a shrill synth melody post-chorus adds a sense of frustration to the otherwise somber mood. With lyrics like “Let me out. I’m trapped in a blur” and “I’m lost in the words,” the song accurately conveys the dull panic of a directionless adolescence, all while maintaining a danceable tune.
From a foundation of confused soul-searching, the album moves on to critique nostalgia as a means of analyzing the past. “Sun in Our Eyes” is a gem. With a peppier beat, MØ’s classic vocals, and a swanky piano riff, the song pays homage to the old MØ. It's catchy — the kind of music people were expecting. And yet, that familiarity stems from the notion that the song is meant to be a flashback to a false memory. Following with the idea that each song adds onto a story, the song's reminiscing hardly paints an accurate picture. The last few years were a blur, something to escape from. Indeed, as the lyrics admit, “Romance makes you blind / I’ll be blinded for a lifetime,” and so explains the uncharacteristic positivity. A song so skillfully put together to bring sunshine on the cloudiest of days hints at a facade of kitsch that calls into question how genuine our memories can be. Though she may fear change, her past was as undefined as her future is uncertain.
Indeed, beyond the drug of nostalgia, the album explores vices that can cloud the truth. The titular drink in “Red Wine” acts as a motif throughout the album, the drink being used in the intro and final song as a means of convincing the protagonist she’s happy with what her life has become. "Imaginary Friend" then touches upon the superficiality of party culture with a simple, repetitive melody to characterize the drone of emotional monotony, further driven in by the almost detached manner in which MØ delivers the chorus. She has essentially overcome the pain of heartbreak by ignoring it with a hookup, and in doing so, she has ignored her real self. All that remains is then imaginary.
Past and present collide in "Purple Like the Summer Rain." An ambient tone eventually reaches the bridge, where MØ wraps up the ballad of the album with a straightforward talk. The spoken words carry authenticity. They aren’t delivered to complement any instrumentals, nor do they follow any pattern or semblance of reason (she roars at one point), but they convey a feeling of defeat, like a silent admission that her jumbled thoughts still haven’t made sense of anything. The ending is just as confused as the beginning: “Where the skies are blue, let me float.” After telling a story so rich, the album ends on a note intangible and ungrounded.
On the surface, the album sounds like an electronic ode to growing up, but a closer listening reveals that the protagonist hasn’t grown up at all. Instead, a flurry of conflicting emotions, the rose-colored lenses of nostalgia, and mind-numbing red wine has left the confusion repressed and packed into lyrical poetry that must yield to flashy beats and an upbeat rhythm. Some tracks sing triumphs and others melodically admit defeat, but the one aspect that never changes is a lack of conclusion.
“Forever Neverland” defies the tropes of story arcs in which some revelation grants closure to the narrative. “Forever Neverland” refuses to end on “happily ever after,” instead serving as a more realistic picture of young adulthood. Growing older doesn’t mean growing up, and growing up doesn’t mean getting answers. In the meantime, we can all kick back and listen to the music, because the mess sounds beautiful.

“We’re going to be engaging in a dialogue,” contemporary Chinese artist Xu Bing said (translated by Joy Chen to English). So opened Bing’s discussion titled “Dragonfly Eyes: What Counts as Art Today,” hosted by the Kim and Judy Davis Dean’s Lecture in the Arts series at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
During this talk, which took place on Oct. 16 at the Knafel Center, Bing foregrounded the theme of language in his work. He is perhaps best known for his mixed-media installation “Book From the Sky,” which earned him the MacArthur Foundation grant in 1999, and contains 4,000 invented Chinese characters — none of which actually mean anything. Bing noted that he is interested in icons and emojis that have the essence of language, because such pictographs are equally inaccessible to everyone.
At the Knafel Center, Bing thus introduced the audience to some of his pieces, walking them through his growth as an artist. He received his education in the People’s Republic of China and moved to the United States in 1990. Bing characterizes his art as “global” due to the clash he creates between language and culture. He is formally versatile, creating sculpture, mixed-media, and (most recently) film. The former vice president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts (Beijing), Bing is now an Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University, as well as a professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.
After orienting the audience to his œuvre, Bing screened the trailer to his latest work, “Dragonfly Eyes” (2017), which the Harvard Film Archive had also screened the previous evening as a prelude to this talk. The film synthesizes 11,000 hours of surveillance footage into an 81-minute piece, which Bing dubs a unique sort of “narrative fiction,” since every frame of it actually happened.
Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study praised “Dragonfly Eyes” in her introductory remarks, noting the “status of the image in an era of omnipresent surveillance.”
Bing emphasized the novelty of the form: Never before had an artist used surveillance footage as a medium in this way. “It’s about taking this limitation and then transforming it into something special,” Bing said, thematically linking “Dragonfly Eyes” to his earlier experiments with the confines of language.
A question and answer session followed Bing’s presentation, featuring two Harvard Professors — Asian art professor Eugene Y. Wang and Director of the Arts at the Radcliffe Institute and History of Art and Architecture Jennifer L. Roberts.
Wang reacted to the film’s quality of touching each viewer, saying that we all share this anxiety about the rapid changes in technology. In this era of surveillance, Wang said, what starts off as a private moment can so easily turn public.
“It really compels us to rethink that kind of demarcation of the private and public that we used to take for granted, and that now you can see is completely inverted,” he said.
Wang has known Bing for nearly two decades, having written a book entitled “Of Text and Texture: The Cultural Relevance of Xu Bing’s Art,” published in 1995. “It’s very gratifying to see ‘Dragonfly Eyes’ as a new breakthrough,” Wang said.
Other fans of Bing’s work reacted similarly. Fay Hannon was an audience member who had been interested in Bing since encountering his “Phoenix” exhibition at St. John the Divine in New York. This piece, like most of Bing’s, reimagines and restages readymade material in an effort to give the viewer new insight. Hannon described Bing’s monumental, recycled works as “totally awesome, totally different.”
Roberts closed the discussion by asking Bing about the future: Where did he think he would take his art next?
Bing said he doesn’t know, but that is the excitement of mixed-media forms: There are “so many places for inspiration.” He expects to transform old forms so that they offer insight into the present moment, adding, “I’m confident that I have something to say.”

“Navigating by Stars” by Mark Russell Gelade features a set of 24 short stories. Each 500-word-or-less snippet gives the reader a view into the mind of a different character, searching for fulfillment and trying to navigate their way through life’s unexpected joys and challenges. Gelade writes emotional, compelling, and poetic prose, calling to mind his background as a poet. The stories and their characters seem unrelated to one another at first, but eventually the pieces of the puzzle fall into place as each character makes an appearance in another story. “Navigating by Stars” is beautifully written, and teaches the reader a lesson on the power of compassion and how each person can play a role in someone else’s life.
Gelade’s work is tragically realistic in that not every story has a happy ending. In fact, very few do. In “Tomorrow—the World,” the narrator writes a break-up letter to her lover, with whom she has been cheating on her husband, Vic. The story seems to head in a positive — hinting at a possible reconciliation with her husband — but ultimately doesn’t: The narrator decides that she is going to file for divorce, closing the letter with the line “Tonight, it’s just you and me Vic, but tomorrow—the world.”
Gelade evokes empathy for every character, despite their faults and mistakes. In one story, the reader may feel antagonistic towards one character for the role they play in the narrator’s life. In another story, Gelade writes from the perspective of that character, humanizing them and helping the reader understand their story, background, and motivations. In “Before I Go,” the narrator is a man on an airplane flying to see his dying mother in her final hours. “She and I were never close,” he writes. “She always preferred her musical protégés over her own son, who couldn’t string two notes of music together even if my life depended on it.” In “Night Vigil,” the narrator is a pupil of the previous narrator’s mother, Mrs. Riesman. To this student, Mrs. Riesman was his greatest mentor. The narrator reminices that “She always saw the best in me. She somehow knew how to support my own dimly formed ideas about who or what I might become when I grew up.” The writing style emphasizes how there is never just a single perspective on any situation, at times putting a character in a completely different light once Gelade depicts their side of the story.
At times, Gelade’s use of language can be difficult to understand, and too flowery and abstract for those not well versed in poetry and prose writing. Due to the “short short” nature of the short stories, the lengths can also make some narratives feel incomplete, making the anthology disjointed. However, the brevity of some stories actually adds to the beauty of this collection: Each story and its characters are ephemeral, reflecting the transient nature of how things come and go in and out of lives.
“Navigating by Stars” is a calming and comforting read that is a reminder that no one is completely alone. Gelade does a stunning job of showing how everyone gets lost at some point, and how part of life is trying to navigate your way back home.
Correction: Oct. 31, 2018
A previous version of this article misspelled the title of one of the short stories included in Mark Russell Gelade's "Navigating by Stars." It is titled "Night Vigil," not "Night Virgil."

A man counts colorful currency and dips two bags of tea in shot-size glasses of boiling water. An ambulance arrives to pick up the victim of a car accident and the first question the paramedic asks is, “Is he Jewish or Arab?” As Sarah (Sivane Kretchner) crouches low, gazing out the rear window of a car, hiding in Saleem’s (Adeeb Safadi) work van, the traffic lights, barbed wire, chain link fences, and sand-bleached walls of Jerusalem streak past. Only behind those walls is a risk they are willing to take.
Sarah and Saleem’s romance is simple: She is a bakery owner in West Jerusalem, and he is a delivery man from East Jerusalem. Their daily flirtations across the counter bloom into a lust that they satisfy in the backseat of his work van. They are both married, so from the beginning, the stakes are high in this affair — but they heighten drastically because Saleem is Palestinian and Sarah Israeli. With Saleem involved in an underground business and Sarah’s husband David (Ishai Golan) a high-ranking military official, neither Sarah nor Saleem knows the contexts of the other outside of their bakery and delivery professions. When their affair is discovered first by Palestinian intelligence and later Israeli intelligence, the implications and cover-ups quickly become complicated.
Palestinian filmmaker Muayad Alayan’s film “The Reports on Sarah and Saleem,” inspired by real events, places the viewer in Jerusalem, at the border of Israel and Palestine, and into the heart of an ethnic and religious conflict that becomes excruciatingly familiar during the two hours in which the film unfolds. Alayan creates an experience that lets one vicariously live on the divide, juxtaposing gender roles from household to household or the kinds of sound and urban bustle per city quarter, be it the muezzin’s song or the European classical music Sarah plays while folding laundry.
The constantly shaky camera adds to an omnipresent suspense and disarray that projects a notion of life in Jerusalem. This is true of both the calm scenes that gaze out onto the stacked houses of Jerusalem beyond Saleem’s shoulder. Shaky camerawork also works in enthralling scenes, in which Saleem’s wife Bisan (Maisa Abd Elhadi), Sarah’s husband David, or Sarah elucidate the truth of the case once Saleem is convicted. The camera lingers on Saleem’s weathered face as he circles Jerusalem making deliveries on many nights, on Bisan in the bus going to university, and on David as he drives to the army office where he works, a star of David hanging from the rearview mirror. Dwelling on such moments of transition, Alayan emphasizes distance — physical but above all emotional — between the many worlds that exist within the limits of this city.
Rami Alayan’s well-crafted screenplay mixed with Muayad Alayan’s direction brings a refreshingly human perspective to a controversial region whose image permeates the world most often through media reportage — in fact pointing out fault in this politicization of humanity. When Sarah confides in her colleague about her affair, her colleague consoles her, saying that people make mistakes, but when Sarah adds that it was with a Palestinian man, she scoffs and asks if Sarah is “crazy” or “that desperate.” Their exchange exhibits how members of one side are incapable of conceptualizing love for the other, or seeing individuals as anything but the political entity they represent. In drawing attention to individual lives, none of whom are caricatured or dramatized in a way that film tends towards, Alayan elevates more profound aspects of characters that perhaps matter more. More often than not, his characters are sympathizable people doing what they feel is necessary given their situation and means, although superficially, these means may be illegal or reprobate. In a telling moment where Saleem is seeking an apartment, when the realtor inquires as to Saleem’s profession, he responds that he is the same as everyone — an astronaut. As he seeks an income and navigates an underground profession, Safadi’s portrait of pained masculinity and subdued wit render Saleem at once piteous and admirable.
Alayan masterfully exposes the power dynamics that frame and politicize Sarah and Saleem’s relationship. In one scene, David shoots a military rifle while Bisan’s Palestinian family throws rocks, showing their starkly different means of defense. In another, David manipulates Sarah by asking her to deliver a specific false testimony incriminating Saleem in order to preserve both their marriage and his career. Saleem finds himself in numerous encounters where he is beaten or tortured in which he cannot seek refuge with the government because his other work is illicit — although he only partakes in this job to sustain himself and his family — or in which he is being tortured by government and army officials, under its scrutiny.
Falling in love becomes inexcusable in a society that has dehumanized its cohabitants. The layers of implications of a rather uncomplex emotional betrayal give Alayan the opportunity to critique the biases of Jerusalem’s citizens. As Sarah, Kretchner’s earnest performance of compassion through her interactions with Saleem’s imprisoned, pregnant wife Bisan lend insight into humanity’s ideal. As Saleem enters his closed trial, his loved ones fear that he will be convicted of a political crime, as opposed to the illicit affair — but Alayan has shown that although it should not be, in Jerusalem, love can be political.

A marching band of five played “Don’t Stop Me Now” at the far end of the third floor promenade inside AMC Loews Boston Commons: a grand entrance for the actors on the first stop of the “Bohemian Rhapsody” press tour. Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon), Gwilym Lee (Brian May), and the Emmy award-winning Rami Malek (Freddie Mercury) arrived on the miniature red carpet fashionably late. Amid the downsized band and carpet, the actors seemed larger than life, which made their genuine warmth all the more gratifying.
“Bohemian Rhapsody” is a celebration of Queen — its rise to success, its struggle, and its revolutionary music — charting the journey of the band from its inception to its legendary 1985 Live Aid concert performance for the relief of the Ethiopian famine. Mercury grapples with his bisexuality, and the film captures Mercury’s courageous comeback in the wake of his AIDS diagnosis.
The Harvard Crimson got a chance to speak with Malek, Mazzello, and Lee about their experience making the film, which features recreations of numerous Queen performances. In fact, the renowned rock band gave some of the most famous performances in history, begging the question: How did the cast prepare to take on such a daunting task?
“Work. Hours and hours of studying footage of the band playing and studying interviews, mannerisms, physicality, and their voices,” Lee said. The actors also received help from a very special guest. Brian May — lead guitarist for Queen — served as the film’s music producer.
“When we’d be doing live performances, he’d be on set,” Lee said. “On the first day of rehearsals, meeting him was pretty terrifying, but he came straight up to us, gave us a big old hug, and from that moment we felt that we had his support and blessing. He was amazing.” Rather than giving technical advice, May coached the cast on how they could sell Queen’s performances physically.
On top of May’s guidance, Malek made sure to prepare for his role as Mercury with archival research and even more physical training.
“If you’re going to play Freddie Mercury, you better honor the man and do him justice. That means being as audacious and liberated as one can be,” Malek said. After watching almost every piece of archival footage on Mercury to be found, Malek went from casual fan to serious devotee.
“I worked with a dialect coach and a movement coach, who helped me articulate his physicality in normal daily life and onstage as well. Freddie wasn’t choreographed, so I didn’t want to work with a choreographer,” Malek said. “I wanted to be able to almost spontaneously combust the way he does on stage. Everything is impulsive with him, and I wanted to be as impulsive as I could day in and day out on that stage and with every sentence everyday for six months.”
Just about everyone knows the iconic boom clap of “We Will Rock You” and the infectious sway of “We Are the Champions.” Queen is known for incorporating the audience into its shows, and the band’s Live Aid performance goes down in history as the most eminent example. When filming the concert that was to be the final scene in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” over 500 extras were present to recreate the vastness of the experience.
“We invited Queen fans to come watch and be in the film,” Malek said. “There is that relationship you need to feed off of them to do some of these concert moments. You really sense the difference [between] when they’re there and when they’re not there, and you need them to lift you up.”
The “We Are the Champions” Live Aid performance was Mazzello’s favorite scene to shoot. “I had an out of body experience doing that,” he said. “I was onstage trying to remember the choreography and I just thought, ‘I can’t believe I’m doing this.’”
To Mazzello, Queen as a band and as captured within “Bohemian Rhapsody” is a band for everybody. “They really speak to the people who are marginalized and the outcast,” Mazzello said. “They always play to that person in the back of the room who feels a little bit lonely, who had a tough day at school or at work. They really want to give enjoyment to as many people as possible. That’s what we want to do with this film also, so if you get a little bit of enjoyment out of it, that’s the point.”
“Bohemian Rhapsody” is slated to hit U.S. theaters on Nov. 2.

Over the course of the last half-century, The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a series of legal rulings rolling back regulatory constraints on political donations. Beginning with Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 and continuing through McConnell v. FEC and Citizens United, the Court has advanced a view that money is equivalent to speech, and therefore that political spending is protected by the First Amendment.
We believe that the influence of money in politics is pernicious for a variety of reasons. Donations are often used to peddle influence, giving outsized power to the ultrawealthy. In the face of a political system that is skewed towards politicians benefiting from the current regime, the best way to implement campaign finance reform is for voters to take direct action and hold elected officials accountable. For these reasons, we support a yes vote on Massachusetts Ballot Question 2, which would create a “Citizens Commission” to advance an amendment to overturn Citizens United and reform campaign finance laws.
Opponents of campaign finance reform often argue that money is a form of speech. Campaign finance regulations, by this argument, constitute an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of speech. However, the claim that spending one’s money is equivalent to expressing one’s opinion directly contradicts the idea that all citizens have an equal voice. Under our current campaign finance system, the amplitude of a citizen’s voice is dependent on the size of their bank account.
Enforcing stricter limits on donations would not be a regulation unique to campaign finance. Standard antitrust law, for example, prohibits companies from buying up too many of their competitors and amassing excessive market power, which would have negative consequences for consumers and other market participants. If antitrust law can limit how much companies can increase their market power, we are skeptical that limits on spending to accumulate political power are meaningfully different.
The logic for supporting Question 2 extends beyond this refutation of the money-as-speech argument. It hinges on a belief in the fairness of American democracy, and the idea that our government serves us best when it reflects the diversity of our origins, our commitments, and our beliefs. Our democracy cannot be equitable when the instruments of power are controlled by a few wealthy families and operated for their own personal gain. We are heartened to see that this commission would seek to reflect a variety of geographic, political, and demographic backgrounds. Ultimately, we hope that this report will be taken seriously and lead to actual changes in the form of a constitutional amendment.

In the 2015 campus climate survey of sexual assault here at Harvard, 26.1 percent of undergraduate seniors (of all genders) reported experiencing some type of nonconsensual sexual contact since enrolling at Harvard. Sexual violence is notoriously underreported due to stigma, shame, and fear, so the real numbers are likely higher.
If 26 percent of Harvard undergraduates will experience sexual assault by the time they graduate, that’s more than 400 people in each class, and almost 2,000 in a four-year period. Who are the perpetrators? If just a quarter of these cases were perpetrated by unique individuals, that’s still 400 people at Harvard who have perpetrated or will perpetrate sexual assault.
Can we expel all 400 of these people? Should we? If we do, I guarantee people you love would be expelled.
We like to imagine that perpetrators are monsters in the shadows, not people who surround us in our everyday lives. When we dehumanize perpetrators, we shirk responsibility for glorifying unhealthy relationships and failing to teach consent.
We also fail survivors by assuming that perpetrators are so rare that stories of sexual violence are fake. We especially fail to give survivors options for healing that do not rely on the criminal justice system. Our current system focuses on punishing perpetrators (if they’re found to be “rightly” accused), rather than healing survivors.
This is where restorative justice comes in. Restorative justice operates outside of the law or the state (which for many are also sources of oppression and trauma). Restorative justice recognizes that when a crime like sexual violence is committed, a person and a community are harmed, and this harm must be repaired. Restorative justice centers healing rather than punishment as true justice. The first step of this is an admission of wrongdoing, and an understanding of the deep harm committed.
College students will likely never admit to what they have done with the weight of punishments like expulsion or jail time hanging over their heads. “The stakes remain too high for the truth to come out,” writes expert practitioner Sujatha Baliga in Vox, “and restorative justice’s core work — recognizing harm, taking responsibility for it, and beginning to repair it — cannot happen under these circumstances.”
So what might restorative justice, which can sound lofty and idealistic, look like in practice? One model we could implement at Harvard is highly facilitated mediation. An expert trained in restorative justice and mental health practices meets individually with the survivor, the person who perpetrated the assault, and others who might be involved (like friends and family), discusses what they will say, and facilitates sessions that can span across months. People are encouraged to speak openly, to tell their truths, and to listen and hear. The ultimate goal is for the survivor to feel empowered and for the person who perpetrated the assault to understand what they did, take responsibility, and engage with the healing steps requested by the survivor.
In a case facilitated by Baliga, the survivor asked for a public apology on social media, and a month of space from Michael, the person who perpetrated the assault. Michael’s friends and family agreed to hold him accountable to this. “And by the end of our time together, it felt like Michael had gained an understanding of consent,” writes Baliga.
How much further could this understanding of consent go towards preventing repeat offenses than a heavy-handed punishment?
Harvard already employs counselors, mental health experts, and Title IX offices. Undergraduates spend years taking classes together, living together, and socializing together. Many survivors are in close proximity at all times to people who have harmed them. The burden of reporting is a turn-off for many: dealing with the exhausting bureaucracy, the many hoops to prove their experience to the administration, and the social backlash. Some even fear the consequences for the perpetrator. Often there is nuance that cannot be addressed with the blunt and onerous instrument of administrative punishment, and therefore survivors may never seek justice or healing.
Restorative justice might not be the answer for everyone, and it is not a prescriptive solution to all cases of sexual violence. Maybe there is no hope for the Brock Turners of the world. But what about the Al Frankens ’73 and the Louis C.K.s, the people who have recognized the harm they caused and want to make amends? One of the most important aspects of restorative justice is giving control back to the survivor, who has the ultimate power to decide whether and how to engage in restorative justice. For some survivors at Harvard, this may not be the right option. But for others — who live in dorms with perpetrators, who go to class with perpetrators, who see perpetrators on a daily basis — this proximity to perpetrators could transform trauma into healing.
Restorative justice would force us as a university community to confront our own culpability in creating a culture of violence and non-consenting behavior. In humanizing perpetrators, we take responsibility. We accept that perpetrators at Harvard are not monsters to be dismissed, but human beings who should take responsibility for the real harm they have done and take part in the hard process of healing.

A few weeks ago, I got takeout for dinner with a friend, and we decided to brave the cold and eat outside in the Yard. We wound up at the temporary outdoor art installation in Tercentenary Theater, “Autumn (…Nothing Personal),” that was taken down at the beginning of October. The installation was a pocket of warm light in the Yard’s late-night darkness, illuminating our faces softly as we sat down on the wooden benches. We ate and talked quietly, catching glimpses of other people coming and going through layers of glowing yellow plastic tubes.
“I don’t normally like art,” my friend said suddenly, “but, for once, this is actually kind of nice.”
I’ve been thinking about that statement a lot. So many people don’t like, or understand, or feel connected to art. But something felt different about the immersive, peaceful atmosphere of “Autumn (…Nothing Personal).” It wasn’t particularly pretentious, intimidating, or even conscious of its role as art. It simply created a welcoming space for us to enjoy each other’s company.
Welcoming spaces like this allow us to live fully in the moment, but the way we approach art often impedes our ability to do so. At museums, the sheer quantity of stuff can be overwhelming, making it difficult to fully contemplate any one work of art. And, when I’ve been lucky enough to see pieces as famous as the “Mona Lisa” or “Starry Night,” they’ve been surrounded by mobs of people taking photographs, viewing the art through their phone screens instead of truly seeing it.
I’m reminded of the absurdity of photographing fireworks, something I’m often guilty of. Every time I do, I wind up with disappointing photos that never look quite right. There’s a reason we watch fireworks in the real world instead of scrolling through images on the Internet: The full sensory experience can’t be communicated digitally. A tiny pixelated screen won’t convey the immense brightness of glowing explosions against a dark sky, the whistling quiet before a thundering crackling of light. Nobody ever looks back on these pictures to reminisce about a firework show, so taking them only detracts from the actual experience.
Much like fireworks, art demands our attention in person. Photos won’t convey a painting’s textures, the richness of its colors, the shared artistic experience with strangers, the physicality of approaching from a distance, and the way its features disintegrate or resolve up close. If a photograph were all we needed, we would stay at home and Google the “Mona Lisa,” or “Starry Night,” to find professional renditions of our shaky iPhone images.
Instead, we go to museums because art is much more than a static visual experience. But it’s so easy to forget this in the presence of masterpieces, which seem inaccessible and daunting on a museum wall. We’re intimidated and distracted from our immediate experience by a sense of awe and an urge to photograph, to capture digitally something that might only be capturable as memory (or not at all).
And art isn’t the only sphere in which intimidating surroundings distract us. Self-consciousness and self-doubt affect the rest of our lives, too. At Harvard, it can be hard to shake off the pressure to prove ourselves, driving our attention away from what we actually care about. For example, I’ve sometimes found myself hesitant to reach out to professors, afraid that I’ll have nothing “smart” to say — but this mindset robs us of thought-provoking conversations, potential mentors, and sparks to fuel our passions. Similarly, our friends’ or classmates’ achievements often trigger twinges of self-doubt, which bitterly detract from our genuine inspiration or delight. And we worry about what we will or won’t or should accomplish by graduation — but this distracts us from what we are accomplishing right now, and what we detest, question, or want to change about our lives.
At the heart of a campus that can be so high-pressure and intimidating, "Autumn (...Nothing Personal)" provided a deeply approachable, social, and introspective space. It asked us to sit on its benches and become part of it, instead of observing from the outside in awe. It asked us to bring our thoughts and conversations with us, immersing us in the present. And it became home to a series of Baldwin readings, performances, and other events envisioned by its creator Teresita Fernandez, thus fully realizing its role as a way to foster human emotion and connection.
I think this is why my friend appreciated the installation so much. Art generally does not welcome the viewer’s participation so clearly and wholeheartedly, does not try to convey how simultaneously social and personal art can be. It’s refreshing to see an installation that rejects the daunting formality of masterpieces on museum walls. And we can also learn to approach other works of art through this lens — not as remote and mystifying masterpieces, but as vehicles for thinking about our own lives.
Harvard needs more spaces that challenge the judgment and pressures we face daily, just as "Autumn (...Nothing Personal)" challenges inaccessibility and intimidation in art. The installation is gone from the Yard now, but it serves as an example of a social landscape that brought together individuals to reflect and to connect. It’s up to us to find or build new spaces, on Harvard’s campus and in our lives, where we can live in the moment without triggering self-doubt. It’s hard to let go of fear and pressure, but it’s something we all face, built into the landscape around us, and open conversation about this reality is the first step to changing it.

Forty percent of respondents to an Institute of Politics poll of 18- to 29- year olds said they are likely to cast a ballot in the midterm elections in one week, and 26 percent said they approve of President Donald Trump’s performance in office.
The IOP released the resuts of its biannual National Youth Poll Monday; it surveyed approximately 2000 individuals nationwide.
At 40 percent, the proportion of likely voters is up 3 percentage points from the IOP’s spring 2018 poll, and is double the recorded turnout of 19.9 percent for 18- to 29-year-olds in the 2014 midterm elections, according to census data.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said he thought taking the pulse of this demographic group “could not be more relevant” ahead of these historic elections, considering both the political stakes in certain battleground state and the potential power of the youth voting bloc.
“This is a generation with creative purpose to address the challenges they see,” Gearan said. “More than ever, young voters have shown they are ready to stand up and be heard.”
Among those surveyed, likely voters preferred Democratic control of Congress by 34 percentage points, 66 to 32 percent — a decrease from the spring 2018 poll, in which Democrats were favored by 41 points, 69 to 28 percent. Landis attributed this decrease to heightened civic engagement among young Republicans.
The percent of respondants who said they approve of Triump's performance is one point higher than in the spring 2018 poll.
Trump received his highest approval ratings for his handling of the economy, which stood at 36 percent — the same rating President Barack Obama received in the IOP’s fall 2014 poll. Among those surveyed who identified as Republicans, 76 percent approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, while only 17 percent of Democrats said the same.
Approval for Trump’s performance regarding relations with North Korea jumped to 33 percent, a six percentage point increase since the spring 2018 poll. Trump’s handling of race relations garnered the lowest approval rating, at just 23 percent.
Looking forward to the 2020 presidential election, 59 percent of young Americans said they would “never” vote for Trump, while 11 percent said they were “sure to” vote for him.
Among those surveyed who identified as Republicans, 37 percent said they are “sure to” vote to reelect Trump.
On Trump’s “handling” of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court — two women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault and he barely earned enough votes to be confirmed — 26 percent said they approved of his performance. Of those surveyed who identified as Democrats, just 5 percent said they approved. In contrast, 71 percent of those surveyed who identified as Republicans said they approved of the way the nomination was handled.
Forty-three percent of those surveyed support capitalism, and support for socialism has dropped to 31 percent, 3 points lower than in 2016. Half of those surveyed were given definitions of capitalism and socialism; of those who were given definitions, 53 percent said they support capitalism, while only 24 percent said they support socialism.
The poll also asked about issues “connected to the democratic socialist agenda,” including a federal jobs guarantee, a proposal to reduce and eliminate college tuition at public four-year institutions, and single payer healthcare — all three of which received majority support. Other questions about labor policies garnered a plurality.
Only a proposal to create a citizen finance campaign system received more opposition than support, with 24 percent supporting and 33 percent opposing.
John Della Volpe, the IOP polling director, attributed this affinity for democratic socialist policies at least in part to the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, which quickly gained traction among young voters.
Overall, 59 percent of young Americans surveyed said they are “more fearful than hopeful” about the nation’s future.
On Nov. 6, if the Republicans maintain control of the house, 59 percent of likely voters who were surveyed say they will have more fear, while 19 percent say they will have more hope. For 20 percent of respondents, it would not make a difference either way.
Theodore “Teddy” N. Landis ’20, student chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, said he thought the National Youth Poll is especially pertinent because the demographic that it surveys is typically “under-researched and over-stereotyped.”
“The thing that I have heard repeatedly is that young people are apathetic, and that they don’t vote,” Landis said. “The first part is entirely untrue.”

Xiaowei Zhuang, a professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, was named the recipient of the 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for her groundbreaking work in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.
Zhuang’s laboratory invented Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy, or STORM, an imaging technique that surpasses the limitations of traditional light microscopes to create 3-D, ultra-high resolution images of cells and tissues.
Using STORM, Zhuang and fellow researchers at her Harvard laboratory have been able to discover previously unknown cellular structures, such as periodic membrane skeletons in neurons.
“It feels particularly rewarding, and it’s a great feeling that we can make new biological discoveries using new methods we ourselves invented,” Zhuang said in a press release.
The Breakthrough Prize is a set of international awards which honor outstanding contributions to the fields of life sciences, mathematics, and fundamental physics. Winners receive $3 million each, making it the most lucrative science prize in the world. Sponsors of the prize include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07.
Zhuang received high praise from the awards board, being touted as a “child prodigy.”
“At age six, she was able to identify the atmospheric force acting upon a glass of water, impressing her father, an aerodynamics professor at China’s leading science and technology university,” a press release from the Breakthrough Prize reads.
Zhuang and fellow laureates will be recognized at the seventh annual Breakthrough Prize ceremony — a gala dubbed “the Oscars of Science” — on Nov. 4.
Zhuang said she appreciated the recognition that came with the awards announcement, but emphasized that accolades are not the driving force behind her research.
“Being recognized is gratifying, but as scientists we don’t work with a goal of winning prizes. We do science because we love it and we love making discoveries and understanding how things work,” Zhuang said in a press release.
Zhuang was appointed as an assistant professor in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department in 2001 and joined the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as an investigator in 2005. She received tenure in 2006.
While the Zhuang Laboratory mainly focuses on cell biology and neurobiology, the advances in imaging made by Zhuang and her colleagues are broadly applicable to other fields that rely on microscopy, including medicine.

Harvard Medical School Professor David E. Reich ’96 spoke Monday night about how ancient DNA can shed light on aspects of human behavior, patterns of migration, and decreasing biological diversity.
Reich’s lecture, titled “Why DNA Has So Far Failed to Provide Clear Insights About Distinctively Human Traits,” was part of a lecture series hosted by the University’s Mind, Brain, and Behavior interfaculty initiative.
Reich, a genetics professor, explained how he uses ancient DNA to study human history and migration. He also emphasized the importance of new and cheaper technologies, which have made possible new analyses of ancient DNA.
“In the last few years, the cost of genetic sequencing has decreased by a factor of a million,” Reich said. “This has revealed how little was known about the genetic relationships between people.”
He then elaborated on new discoveries, frequently coming out of his own lab at Harvard, such as an understanding that some human traits are more complicated to genetically determine.
“We now know that many traits, like height for example, are affected by tens of thousands of genetic variants working together in virtually undetectable ways,” he said. “The great majority of DNA sequences are the same. Miniscule differences in those sequences, caused by mutations, is what gives us insights about differences in humanity.”
New capabilities in genetic research have shown, however, that genetic diversity is decreasing, and traits are therefore becoming potentially more homogenous, according to Reich.
To some of the many faculty members who attended the lecture, Reich is something of a celebrity.
“David Reich is my hero,” said Andrew J. Berry, an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology lecturer. “It’s actually embarrassing to introduce him.”
Rebecca Goldstein, a Psychology Department associate, said she found the lecture engaging.
“You could’ve known nothing about genetics, and he explained everything perfectly,” she said.
Following the talk, Berry said he was hesitantly optimistic about the new possibilities of genetic research, which has yielded new discoveries in a short time period but has also given fewer insights about specific biological traits than expected.
“It was a sort of glass half full, glass half empty presentation but, well put it this way, ‘I’m definitely glass half full,’” Berry said. “When you do this kind of analysis, bang… lo and behold, you can actually see the footprint of those changes of history.”

Four tickets will compete for the Undergraduate Council’s presidency and vice presidency in the student body’s 2018 election in November, according to the UC Election Commission.
Two of this year’s tickets are composed of UC veterans. Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20 is running alongside Arnav Agrawal ’20, chair of the Council’s Student Life Committee, while Education Committee Chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 is running with Lowell House Representative Julia M. Huesa ’20. On the flip side, the other two tickets are composed entirely of non-UC members: Currier House resident Daniel K. Ragheb ’20 and Lowell House resident Samyra C. Miller ’21 are vying for Council leadership, as are Leverett House resident John T. Ball ’20 and Dunster House resident Sabrina Wu ’20.
Prospective candidates needed to gather 150 signatures from fellow students by Monday evening to appear on the ballot. Voting for this year’s UC president and vice president will run from Monday, Nov. 12 to Thursday, Nov. 15.
Three tickets ran for the Undergraduate Council’s top jobs last year, while four pairs competed in 2016.
UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said in an interview Monday evening that he hopes for a “fruitful” and “healthy” campaign.
“I think when we allow an election to be focused on the issues and the beliefs of the candidates, we end up having the best discussions, the best debate, and ultimately arrive at the best candidates,” Boucher said.
In keeping with tradition, Boucher and UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said they do not plan to endorse a candidate in the race.
Recent UC presidential elections have experienced declining voter turnout, including a record-low 2,074 ballots cast in last fall’s election. Last year’s lower turnout, representing less than one-third of College undergraduates, was likely caused at least in part by issues with the voting software. In January, the Council debuted new election software — created by an external organization called OrgSync — in order to prevent similar problems in the future.
Although candidates are not permitted to speak to the media on-the-record until the campaign officially kicks off next Wednesday, posts on social media asking for petition signatures provide a window into their possible pitches come campaigning period.
Palaniappan wrote on Facebook that her ticket would focus on “centering” the voices of undergraduates in their campaign. If elected, she pledged to work to make campus “more inclusive.”
Khoury touted her and Agrawal’s experience on the Council, saying they had helped increase funding to student groups and convinced the administration to provide free menstrual hygiene products, among other achievements.
Ragheb pointed to what he called a lack of mental health “support” and a need for stronger sexual assault prevention, education, and response as the main reasons he jumped into the race.
Ball wrote on Facebook he planned to push the University to fund improvements to campus facilities, especially for the College’s Women’s Center and peer counseling services, which are currently housed in basements that he claims are suffering from mold problems.
Two of this year’s presidential tickets are composed of non-UC members, the first time since at least 2007 that so many outsiders are throwing their hats into the ring. Council outsiders have historically fared poorly running for the UC leadership. The only time a non-UC member has been elected president or vice president of the Council was in November 2013, when Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 won on a joke ticket promising to make tomato basil ravioli soup available at all meals.

Members of the Department of History and the Crimson Key Society led a “Ghost and Skeleton Tour” of Harvard Yard on Monday evening two days before Halloween, offering participants spooky stories of haunted Harvard buildings as well as a more somber window into the University’s past “skeletons.”
Two concurrent 90-minute tours, led by Zachary B. Nowak, a College fellow in the History department, and Crimson Key Society tour coordinator Anna C. Henricks ’20, respectively, touched on a number of Harvard’s most significant landmarks in the Yard. At each stop, guides told two kinds of spooky stories — paralleling supernatural tales of alleged hauntings with discussions of fraught events in Harvard’s history.
Nowak, sporting a 19th century-themed costume and skeleton makeup, said he hoped the tour would demonstrate that history is “something that's outside the classroom, and all around you, and also has a lot of relevance to your daily life, especially your experience at Harvard.”
During the tour, participants had the opportunity to journey through Harvard’s steam tunnels, which span 3 miles underground. The steam tunnels have their own share of history: amid World War II, a German spy absconded into the tunnels to evade the pursuit of an FBI agent.
Dylan R. de Waart ’19 said the steam tunnel was his favorite part of the tour.
“Sprinting through the steam tunnels made it seem like I was in my own spy thriller,” he said.
While the tour included some levity for participants, parts of it took on a more serious tone.
Outside of Wadsworth House, Nowak spoke of four slaves who lived and worked in the idyllic yellow building during the 18th century. In 2016, the University installed a plaque dedicated to Bilhah, Venus, Titus, and Juba — the four slaves owned by Harvard presidents. In a Crimson op-ed announcing the move, then-President Drew G. Faust wrote the University would form a panel of historians to examine Harvard’s ties to slavery.
During the tour, Crimson Key tour guides also pointed to a plaque which recognizes the defunct Harvard Indian College, built in 1655 near the current site of Matthews Hall, with the goal of proselytizing Native American students to Christianity.
When arriving at University Hall, the guides discussed the history of a 1920 secret commission chaired by then-Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, to investigate and root out affiliates suspected of homosexual behavior. The Crimson first reported on the existence of the tribunal in 2002.
Describing the tour’s mix of spooky stories and Harvard history, Nowak said that “the ‘ghosts’ is what brings people to the tour, but the skeleton part is what we really want to tell them about.”
Henricks said that this tour was unlike most Crimson Key tours, which usually do not address more controversial aspects of the University’s history.
“I think it’s...really cool to sort of delve into a lot of the issues that often people don’t talk about at Harvard,” she said.
De Waart said he thought it is important for students to have a complete understanding of Harvard’s history.
“It’s critical for Harvard students to understand what this institution was built on and where all of this privilege that we have comes from so that we can do a better job at giving back to the communities that brought us to where we are today,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past two weeks, Courtroom 17 in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse has been pretty quiet.
Lawyer after lawyer took the stand in the wood-paneled, fifth-floor chamber to argue for or against affirmative action in the high-stakes and high-profile Harvard admissions trial — but the attorneys typically spoke in muted voices. Audience members conferred in whispers, if at all. Often, the only noise was the clicking of reporters’ keyboards or the occasional whoosh of a door swinging shut.
On the first day of the trial’s third week, the silence broke.
When Harvard senior Thang Q. Diep ’19 stepped down from the witness stand around 2:40 p.m., scores of spectators — many of them College undergraduates — broke into loud applause.
Diep, who was born in Vietnam, had just spent 40 minutes spilling his life story to explain why Harvard must keep its race-conscious admissions system. He recounted an at-times difficult childhood — noting that elementary school peers “made fun of my accent” — and said he reclaimed his Vietnamese heritage when he applied to the College.
“I wrote about my Vietnamese identity on my application because it was just a big part of myself,” Diep said. “I was tired of erasing my identity for so long... so I brought the power back in my college essay.”
He said he wouldn’t have made it to Harvard without the College’s race-conscious admissions policies.
“I personally benefited from affirmative action,” Diep said. “It allows my immigration history to be taken into account, my own experiences taken into account.”
Diep was one of eight current and former Harvard undergraduates who stood to testify on the eleventh day of the trial. At stake in the case — the product of a four-year-old lawsuit brought by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions — is whether the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
Experts have said a cascading series of appeals could bring the trial, slated to end Friday, before the Supreme Court. If the case reaches the nation’s highest court, it could mean the end of affirmative action in the United States.
Monday’s witnesses, all of whom are non-white, did their best to prevent that outcome. Drawing on personal experiences — including tales of childhood bullying, fears over Harvard’s whiteness, and comfort found in College affinity groups — the eight students and alumni offered an emotional and impassioned defense of race-conscious admissions.
Like Diep, several student witnesses said their racial or ethnic identity shaped their early life — and that the Harvard application process allowed them to take pride in their heritage.
Harvard alumnus Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, who identifies as indigenous Mexican American, said she faced racially motivated bullying during her childhood in Southern California. Vasquez-Rodriguez said classmates “stereotyped and critiqued” her.
Peers called her a “coconut,” she said, meaning she was “brown on the outside and white on the inside.”
When college application season rolled around, Vasquez-Rodriguez drew on her racial background to convince admissions officers she deserved a spot at Harvard. In a personal essay titled “Different,” Vasquez-Rodriguez wrote that she wanted to spend the rest of her life representing and embracing Latino culture.
“All of my life’s ambitions revolve around communities of color and my ethno-racial identity,” Vasquez-Rodriguez said in court Monday, noting she would not have applied to Harvard if the school did not consider race in its admissions process.
Sarah F. Cole ’16, who testified later in the day, said the same. Cole, who is African-American, spoke at length about her “blue-collar” upbringing. She recounted how her father woke up early to stand in line at food pantries when he was between jobs.
Cole testified that she faced “casual racism” from classmates at the prestigious and majority-white high school she attended. She said she could not possibly have applied to Harvard without writing about her race and the way it shaped her early life.
“Race-blind admissions is an act of erasure,” Cole said. “To not see my race is to not see me.”
Others said their race and a perception Harvard is far “too white” almost prevented them from applying to the College in the first place. They testified that Harvard’s efforts to recruit students from historically marginalized racial groups — especially via programs like the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program — convinced them to take the plunge.
“I wanted to be on a campus that is excited about diversity,” said Madison A. Trice ’21, who is African-American.
Still, Cambridge proved less diverse than some had hoped.
Vasquez-Rodriguez said most classes she has taken at Harvard were majority-white. She said she felt like “a huge minority in almost every space” — and that made her “very nervous.”
Margaret M. Chin ’84, a sociologist at Hunter College and the City University of New York Graduate Center, testified that she felt the same way as an undergraduate in the 1980s.
“I never had met so many rich, white people in my life,” Chin said. “I was intimidated, especially in the classroom.”
The eight witnesses almost all said they found their niche by joining campus affinity groups.
Chin signed up for the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association. Trice joined the Association of Black Harvard Women and the Black Student Association. Cole did, too, eventually rising through BSA’s ranks to become its president.
Yet another witness, Vietnamese-American Harvard sophomore Catherine H. Ho ’21, currently serves as president of the Asian American Women’s Association.
The students and alumni said it was comforting to find a space filled with people who looked like them. A Crimson survey of the Class of 2022 found that respondents are roughly 46 percent white, 18 percent Asian, 11 percent black or African-American, and 7 percent Hispanic or Latino.
Cole said she still remembers the way her white and black peers reacted to the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Black Harvard students were “deeply weeping,” she said — but white classmates appeared less concerned.
“We couldn’t lean on them,” she said. “We could only really lean on each other.”
The witnesses said the elimination of race-conscious admission would mean fewer minority students matriculate at Harvard each year. On a campus where many students of color already feel isolated and alone, this decrease would be disastrous, the students said.
Vasquez-Rodriguez called a hypothetical reduction in the number of African-American and Latinx students attending the College “frankly catastrophic.”
Trice said her love for the affinity groups she participates in drove her to testify in court Monday.
“I think that my love for Harvard is entirely or mostly rooted in the people I encounter,” Trice said. “It would be a shame if that diversity is lost because it means the world to me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since departing Detroit following four seasons as the head coach and president of basketball operations for the Pistons, Stan Van Gundy has joined the guest coach clinician rank-and-file, traversing campuses around the nation to share his treasure trove of knowledge to an eager crop of high school coaches.
The 12-year NBA head coach capped off his busy week in Cambridge as the guest-of-honor for Harvard Basketball’s annual coaching clinic on Sunday, following in the footsteps of his younger brother and current ESPN commentator Jeff Van Gundy who visited Lavietes Pavilion in 2008.
Not hiding his trademark boisterous personality nor his vociferous coaching style, the elder Van Gundy dedicated his two-hour session almost exclusively to transition offense principles, guiding his audience step-by-step through a variety of spacing and ball distribution schema. Spiced into his technical scrutiny of flare screens and analytics was a bountiful mix of humor (i.e. praising coach Tommy Amaker for hiring “non-shooter” assistants who could deliberately miss during drills). Quickly, it was clear why “SVG” had been a staple in the league for so many years.
During a mid-day lunch break, Van Gundy sat down with Crimson Sports and Harvard Magazine and shared some of his broader thoughts about Amaker’s program, the Ivy League, and his career as a whole. Here are some of the highlights of our discussion:
Impressions of Harvard Basketball:
“It is incredible the difference in this program. Before Tommy got here there was certainly no national relevance to Harvard and for a lot of the time, there hasn’t even been Ivy League relevance to Harvard. Now it’s the gold standard...it is incredible what Tommy has done and the level of guys that he has recruited.”
On the Ivy League:
“The level of coaching in the league right now is probably as high as it’s ever been….as much as the recruiting in the league has gotten better, I don’t know in the Ivy League if you are ever going to be in the position where you can just go out and select guys to come in and fit your system. So you are going to have a philosophy and system that you are going to have to tweak all the time. So you go from Jeremy Lin as your best player and now you have a big guy.”
“What Tommy has done here has not only elevated Harvard but indirectly elevated the entire league because you have got to be at a higher level now to compete in the Ivy League.”
Advice to Current Harvard Student-Athletes:
“We all fall victim to looking ahead, particularly when you are in college...also realize that you are never going to have this moment again and savor this experience at Harvard and of being on a very good team and program. It will not only help you the rest of your life but also these guys will be bonded forever...don’t forget about right here and right now and enjoy it.”
On Tommy Amaker:
“I remember him when he was a high school player...what you see in Tommy Amaker is you’ve seen the guy be in situations where he has been in the top and you have seen a guy be in situations where he’s struggled with adversity. He was talking today about getting fired at Michigan. The thing that I’ve noticed with him and I think anybody has been in our profession and watched him would say is he has handled it all with class.”
“This program obviously is very special to him and it is [about] winning games, but he’s a guy who really sees the whole world and basketball is relatively small part in this whole thing. He relishes his basketball program’s role on a very special campus and the role it can play. It is sort of a rallying point, something for the school and community to get behind. He is well aware of all the important things happening on this campus.”

“There are days I wake up and really miss [coaching] and want to get back to it right away, and there are other days and I’ll turn on the TV and I’ll watch a friend of mine and his team is having a tough night. You can see the anguish and you say, 'Boy I don’t miss that at all, I can just grab a beer and sit down and watch the game, and he can’t.' So I don’t know… when we hit the spring time and even year to year we will see. I don’t know what we will do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing Friday against Columbia, Harvard prolonged its undefeated streak at home, defeating the Lions in straight sets. This record lasted only one more night however, as the Crimson lost its first home game of the season against Cornell in four hard-fought sets.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 1
Before the game even started, there was a water leak in the Malkin Athletic Center that delayed the start of the match. Beginning the match an hour after the intended start time appeared to have Harvard (10-9, 5-5 Ivy) out of its groove, as the hosts did not have the offensive display it had in its game the day before against Columbia (9-11, 3-7).
“It started weird with the leak in the ceiling," said senior setter Brooke Istvan after the game. "I don’t know if we really recovered from that. I don’t think we came out as strong as we could have.”
After falling in back-and-forth opening set 25-19, the Crimson were able to rally some momentum and tie the match 1-1 with a 25-23 victory in the second set. However, Harvard was unable to capitalize off its strong second set take a lead and lost the next two sets 25-19 and 25-15.
During the first set, it was evident that the Crimson were phased by the late start that happened because of the water leak. They were missing serves and could not get into an offensive flow. After keeping it tight during the early part of the set, Harvard was put into a late deficit that it could not get out of.
A key substitution after the first set, switching out sophomore Evelyn Gray with senior Jocelyn Meyer, led to a strong second set from the Crimson, where there offense was more reminiscent of how they played against Columbia the previous day.
“We had a change in mentality and definitely wanted to win more,” remarked Istvan on the momentum change in the second set.
Harvard was not able to keep up this momentum in the third and fourth sets. After losing the third set, the Big Red (11-8, 7-3) came out with potent attack in the fourth set and jumped to a 19-7 lead. The Crimson had dug themselves too deep a hole, and after a small comeback attempt in the fourth set, the team ultimately fell 25-15 and lost the match.
Despite a disappointing end result, the Crimson still had offensive bright spots throughout the game. Senior middle blocker Christina Cornelius had a team high 11 kills while junior middle blocker Maclaine Fields recorded a team best .300 hitting percentage. On the defensive side, senior libero Anna Uhr and sophomore outside specialist Sandra Zeng, had 12 and 11 digs respectively.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
Harvard was able to defeat Columbia in three tightly contested sets as a result of its strong defensive performance. The score of the match was tied 21 times, including 11 knots in the first set alone. The Crimson held Columbia to .101 hitting percentage and did not allow the Lions to acquire an offensive rhythm of any sort.
The defense was led by senior Anna Uhr who continued to lead the back court with 14 digs in this match. She was aided by sophomore Evelyn Gray, junior Maclaine Fields, and senior Christina Cornelius who had six, five, and four block assists respectively. The six block assists were a career-high for Gray, who has been a stalwart on the defensive side for Harvard this season.
Along with its stout defense, Columbia did not have an answer for the Crimson’s strong attack. Harvard’s offense was led by junior Grace Roberts Burbank, who had nine kills and a career-high .500 attack percentage. The San Francisco native had a nearly flawless game as she registered only one error. Cornelius and Gray, key contributors to the Crimson’s stifling defense, also had stellar contributions to the Crimson’s offense, each recording eight kills.
Harvard’s versatility on both sides of the court overwhelmed Columbia from start to finish, resulting in a crushing third set where they secured 14 kills to hit at a .294 clip. Freshman Bella Almanza’s performance was indicative of the Crimson’s versatility as she almost recorded a double-double with 29 assists and nine digs. Her presence on both the offensive and defensive side was a spark plug for Harvard’s victory on Friday.
“We came out pretty strong against Columbia and did what we had to do,” Istvan said.
Next week, Harvard will enjoys its last two home games of the season, where they look to finish strong against Yale and Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following its win against Dartmouth, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., to face No. 7 Cornell with the hosts ultimately coming out with the victory. Following the loss to the Big Red, the Crimson moved on to Hamilton, N.Y to face No. 9 Colgate but were edged 1-0, putting the team 0-2 for this weekend’s road games.
COLGATE 1, HARVARD 0
After its defeat at Cornell, Harvard (1-2, 0-2 ECAC) made some adjustments to the back line which were on display for its game against the Raiders (5-3, 2-0). However, the Crimson wasn’t the only ones playing stellar defense as Colgate matched Harvard’s energy, ultimately lead to a Raiders victory.
Halfway through the first period, freshman forward Dominique Petrie was penalized for checking, giving Colgate its first power play opportunity. However, the Raiders were unable to capitalize on the advantage due to Harvard’s solid power play defense.
“We shut them down,” senior defender Kaitlin Tse said. “That was a huge momentum gainer for the team.”
Colgate also got to showcase its solid power play defense on Harvard’s first power play, preventing the Crimson from using the advantage to gain the lead.
After a scoreless two periods, the Raiders managed to get on the board with senior forward Jessie Eldridge scoring early in the third period. Harvard, unable to answer, fell to a score of 1-0 as the clock expired.
Despite the loss, Harvard’s freshman goalie Lindsay Reed made a career-high of forty-nine saves, with twenty-one of those saves coming in the second period.
“Any night you can have a goaltender do that…it definitely gives the team confidence to play a little bit more offensively,” Tse said. “Lindsay is a good kid and we are excited to have her on the team.”
Despite the loss, the Crimson gained some key lessons for its upcoming games as it prepares for next weekend’s road game against Quinnipiac.
“We talked about getting ready,” head coach Katey Stone said. “Get ready during the week, so you are ready on the weekends. Some kids are more ready than others and we have to get those young kids up to speed, so that we can play more people in the line-up. That is our goal.”
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2
After a frozen battle of clashing wills, Harvard fell short for its first road test of the season, losing 3-2 to Cornell.
Halfway through the first period — after some back and forth activity between the two rivals — Cornell was given an opportunity to take the lead in the form of a power play. Hoping to take advantage of this opportunity, the Big Red showered Harvard with a flurry of shots.
Harvard, despite being at a disadvantage, managed to hold off Cornell’s attack early in the power play. However, in the final seconds of the power play, Big Red junior forward Grace Graham snuck the puck past the goal line, putting Cornell on the board.
Three minutes later during another power play, the Big Red added to its lead thanks to a powerful shot by junior defender Jaime Bourbonnais.
“We started off pretty late,” Tse said. “We didn’t stick to our game plan and catered to what [Cornell] was doing.”
With a 1:23 left in the first period, the Crimson capitalized on a power play situation, managing to cut Cornell’s lead by half. During the man advantage, captain Lexie Laing redirected a shot from junior forward Kat Hughes, burying the puck inside the net. After another goal by the Big Red late in the second period by junior forward Paige Lewis, the Crimson found itself down 3-1.
In the final two minutes of the game Harvard pulled its goalie in favor of an extra skater, looking to increase its offense firepower. The Crimson scored again thanks to freshman forward Anne Bloomer, cutting Cornell’s lead to one.
With 25 seconds left in the game, Harvard looked to capitalize off its gaining momentum, but was unable to as the Big Red managed to keep the puck in its possession during the last seconds of the game.
