After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School alumnus Joseph P. Kennedy III announced last week that he is considering a run for the Massachusetts congressional seat previously held by Barney Frank ’61-’62.
Kennedy, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Congressman Joseph Kennedy, would be the first in his family to run for public office since the 2009 death of his great-uncle, Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
“My decision to look seriously at elected office is grounded in a deep commitment to public service and my experience—both my own and that of my family—in finding just, practical, and bipartisan solutions to difficult challenges,” Kennedy said in a statement last week announcing his intentions to form an Congressional exploratory committee.
Kennedy could reach a decision to run as early as the end of the month, according to former Boston City Councilor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71. Though the field for the Democratic nomination remains wide open, DiCara said a Kennedy bid would likely discourage a number of potential candidates and set up a battle with Boston City Councilor Michael P. Ross.
“I think both those guys are very strong candidates,” DiCara said. “It could be a doozy of [a] fight.”
Kennedy, who is 31 years old, announced he would leave his position as Assistant District Attorney for Middlesex County at the end of next week.
Frank announced he would not seek reelection in November after election forecasts predicted a difficult battle due to the redrawing of his district. The new district lines added 325,000 constituents—many of whom are Republican—and did not include New Bedford, an area that consistently voted for Frank.
“No one should think that because Barney occupied that district for so long that the next rep. will automatically fit (his) description,” DiCara said. “It’s not a district which automatically goes to the person who has the most degrees and is the farthest to the left.”
Though the political makeup of the district is significant, DiCara said that the packaging of the candidates—and the star power of the Kennedy name—will play an important factor in the race.
“It’s not all about who votes which way. It’s a lot about personality. Both Ross and Kennedy are very attractive, articulate, well spoken young men,” DiCara said.
In addition to resigning from the district attorney’s office, Kennedy has made plans to move from his mother’s home in Cambridge, where he currently resides, to an apartment in Newton later next month in order to reside within the district in which he will run, according to the Boston Globe.
Though Kennedy has never held elected office, this is not his first foray into politics. He served as the co-chairman of his Edward Kennedy’s final campaign in 2006 and considered running last year when Congressman William D. Delahunt retired.
“The lack of common sense and fairness in Washington is a byproduct of the partisan gridlock that has turned obstruction into victory. Americans are better than that,” Kennedy said in a statement last week.
Kennedy has emphasized his record of public service.
After graduating from Stanford, Kennedy served a two-year stint in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic. While a student at Harvard Law School, Kennedy volunteered in the Law School’s legal aid office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years.  The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings. 
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer. 
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
First up, we have football stalwart Josue Ortiz against top wrestler Walter Peppelman. Check back later this week to find out the winner of this first-round matchup.
Defensive Tackle Josue Ortiz—10 sacks, 38 tackles, 15 tackles for loss
 
Billed as one of the top defenders in the Ancient Eight after his monster 2010 season, senior Josue Ortiz lived up to the hype in 2011. Considered perhaps the strongest person in Ivy football, Ortiz was double-teamed on nearly every down yet still managed to lead the conference with 10 sacks. He also formed the core of the vaunted Harvard D-Line, which allowed a league-low 89.7 rushing yards per game.
Unsurprisingly, the accolades started rolling in after the season ended. A third-team All-American for the second straight season and a first-team All-Ivy leaguer, Ortiz was named the MVP of Harvard football, won the Asa S. Bushnell award as the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, and took home the New England Football Writers Assocation’s Harry Agganis Award, given to the best senior football player in New England.
And oh yea—he proposed after Harvard beat Yale, 45-7.
 
Wrestler Walter Peppelman—33-9 overall record, 16-1 in dual action
 
The graduation of 2010 national champion (and current assistant coach) J.P. O’Connor ’10 left the Harvard wrestling team with big shoes to fill in 2011. But luckily, sophomore Walter Peppelman’s foot was exactly the right size. Wrestling in the same weight class as O’Connor, Peppelman’s 33 wins in 2010-11 ranked seventh on Harvard’s single-season list. In just his second collegiate year, he finished eighth at the 2011 NCAA Championships at 157 pounds.
Despite his relatively young age, Peppelman was also recognized as a leader by his teammates and was named a co-captain before the season began. That honor started off a year of success for Peppelman, who placed fifth at the EIWA Championships and went 16-1 in dual action, ending the season with a 33-9 mark. He also recorded 10 pins, good for 10th most in a season in Harvard history. For his efforts, the grappler was named to the All-Ivy League first team.
In the 2011-12 season, Peppelman has picked up right where he left off, finishing third at the Binghamton Open and winning the Keystone Classic.

And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
After examining the matchup between Josue Ortiz and Walter Peppelman last night, we now turn to a faceoff between men's basketball star Keith Wright and men's volleyball standout Matt Jones. 
Outside Hitter Matt Jones—332 kills, 91 digs, 61 blocks, 30 service aces
 
After a dominant sophomore season, Jones emerged as not only Harvard’s top performer, but also one of the best in the EIVA. Jones’ 332 kills in 2011 nearly matched the next two top marks on the team combined. A versatile player, the Applied Math concentrator was also fifth on the squad in digs and third in blocks.
Despite the team’s struggles in EIVA play, Jones racked up some of the best stats in the conference, and his 3.95 kills per set was fourth best in the league in 2011. While the team struggled for much of the season, Jones played a pivotal role in snapping a seven-game conference losing skid, lifting Harvard to a 3-1 win over NJIT with a 24-kill performance.
Forward Keith Wright—10.9 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 1.4 BPG
 
During the latter half of the 2010-11 season, Keith Wright was unstoppable. In Ivy League play, the 6-8 forward averaged 15.4 points and 8.9 rebounds per game, leading the Crimson to a share of its first ever Ivy League title. After the season, Wright was just the second player in program history to be honored with the Ivy League Player of the Year award.
With the addition of a talented crop of rookie forwards, Wright’s numbers have taken a dip in the first half of the 2011-12 season—he now averages just 10.9 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. But his importance to the Crimson has not decreased. In games in which Wright posts at least 10 points, Harvard is currently 9-0. When Wright fails to reach double figures, the Crimson is just 4-2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a shocking 60-54 loss to Fordham on Tuesday, Harvard managed to remain in the top 25 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll, coming in at No. 25. But the Crimson’s didn’t fare as well in the AP Top 25, receiving just 16 points and falling 10 spots, well out of the rankings.
In the coaches poll, Harvard extended its four-week stint, though the squad dropped four spots. Garnering 58 points, the Crimson made the top 25 with 15 points to spare.
That led to some disgruntlement in the blogosphere, like from ESPN.com blogger Eamonn Brennan. In a Monday post, Brennan wrote, “Harvard's inclusion in the poll is one of the more glaring coaches' mistakes we've seen thus far this season,” pointing to the squad’s relatively weak schedule and an RPI of 46.
In the AP Poll, after receiving 269 points last week, the Crimson plummeted after the road loss at the hands of the Rams and is now 154 points behind No. 25 Marquette.
Following the Fordham loss, Harvard answered its critics. In its most recent game, the Crimson earned a double-digit 63-47 victory over Dartmouth, Harvard’s first league opponent, at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday.
This upcoming week, the Crimson will face two sub-.500 teams, first travelling to Monmouth tomorrow and then playing a Saturday matinee with George Washington in front of its home fans.
