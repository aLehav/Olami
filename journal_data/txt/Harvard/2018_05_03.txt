After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor,
I read your article "Majority of Faculty Support Fossil Fuel Divestment, Social Group Sanctions”, which is the first in a series of planned articles that makes use of a survey that was sent to faculty in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
I am very concerned with the methodology employed for the survey, as well as the interpretation of results.
The survey was sent out to members of the FAS faculty through a repeated set of emails, which invited faculty to click on a weblink. Unfortunately, anyone could click on the link and take the survey. As such, it is impossible to know how many people who took the survey were actually FAS faculty. Therefore, the claim that the survey represents the opinion of over 1,000 faculty is not correct, nor can you claim a 43% response rate.
The interpretation of the results does state that the reported numbers have not been adjusted for response bias. But, if we take response bias seriously, as survey researchers and pollsters do, then you cannot make claims, such as “Majority of Faculty Support X,” or really any other claim about the data that attempts to characterize the faculty as a whole. Assuming that everyone who took the survey was an FAS faculty member, based on the response rate, all of the claims in the article could be flipped.
Running polls and interpreting the results requires responsibility. And I applaud your efforts to take seriously some of the questions you ask about our community. Irrespective of the conclusions you reach, running another four stories on this data would be irresponsible. Rather than print additional articles that are factually incorrect, I would take a step back and think through a redo of your efforts. This would include a modified approach to fielding the survey, the pre-registration of analysis plans to prevent “fishing” for relationships, and perhaps even consultation with Harvard’s Institutional Review Board for general guidance on research involving human subjects.

Editor's Note: The Crimson has corrected the headline of the April 30, 2018 story “Majority of Surveyed Faculty Support Fossil Fuel Divestment, Social Group Sanctions” to reflect the fact that data in the article reflects the opinions of respondents to a survey conducted by The Crimson, not the Faculty of Arts and Sciences overall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bridget Terry Long, a Harvard Graduate School of Education professor and economist, will become the school’s next dean, University President Drew G. Faust announced Wednesday.
Long will be the first black woman to lead the Ed School when she assumes the role on July 1. Her appointment ends a search for the successor to Ed School Dean James E. Ryan, who announced he would leave Harvard for the University of Virginia in Sept. 2017. Ryan will depart the deanship after nearly five years to become the president of the University of Virginia.
Long brings a wealth of Harvard experience to the job. In addition to her current role as a professor of education and economics at HGSE, she previously served as the school’s academic dean from 2013 to 2017 and as the faculty director of the Ed.D. program from 2010 to 2013.
“I start this new role with gratitude for all that HGSE has given me and a strong sense of purpose that centers on the mission of our School,” Long said in a press release. “I’m here because I believe in this community and what we can do together.”
“You can’t help but be inspired by the faculty, students, and staff, who are all working toward the goal of improving the world through education,” Long added.
Both Faust and Ryan said in the press release they are excited to see Long assume the deanship.
President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, who will succeed Faust and launch his presidency around the same time Long becomes dean, also said in the release that he is thrilled by Long’s appointment.
“We share a common interest and passion for improving access to higher education for talented students from families of limited means,” Bacow said. “I look forward to working closely with her to achieve this goal and to advancing the important work of the School.”
Long was born in Baltimore and grew up in the Midwest. She attended Princeton University as an undergraduate before earning master’s and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard. She first joined the Harvard faculty in 2000 as an assistant professor, and worked her way through the ranks across the next decade. Since 2011, she has held the title of Saris Professor of Education and Economics.
Long’s research focuses on student transitions between high school, college, and the working world. In particular, she analyzes the ties between scholarly success and affordability as well as the role of financial aid programs in increasing access to colleges and universities. At the Ed School, she has taught classes on the role of policy in college access and success for students, as well as the economics of higher education.
Long has won multiple accolades for her scholarship. She has earned grants and awards from the U.S. Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—and former President Barack Obama in 2010 appointed her to the National Board for Education Sciences.
Faust said in the press release Wednesday that she believes Long will be successful in her new role.
“Professor Long brings the energy and imagination to create an environment that will nurture new ideas and inspire solutions to some of the most pressing problems in education,” Faust said in the release. “Professor Long is extraordinarily capable of leading the School.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 3, 2018 at 9:38 p.m.
Harvard is “reviewing” reports that University employee Eric Clopper made anti-Semitic comments and stripped to the nude during a public performance he gave in Sanders Theatre Tuesday evening, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Clopper, a systems administrator at the language resource center located in Lamont Library, offered these remarks as part of his one-man production “Sex & Circumcision: An American Love Story,” an event advertised on three separate Harvard websites—though as of Wednesday evening, a listing for the production had been deleted from the Harvard College site.
Videos obtained by The Crimson show Clopper pacing around the Sanders stage—a Harvard-owned space where some of the College’s largest and most popular classes are taught—and offering denunciations of circumcision that at times morphed into attacks against Judaism more broadly.
“The Jews—I know, I’m one of them—are an unmasked genital mutilation cult,” Clopper said, according to the videos. “That is why we are so clannish. It is our shared delusion of superiority that we must uphold to maintain our perverted tribal identity.”
At other points in the videos, Clopper claimed “the Jews” had “raped” him and that Judaism has a “demonstrably evil influence” on the United States. He also vowed he would “expend every breath in my body” to tear “this covenant to pieces,” likely referencing the bond individuals of the Jewish faith believe they hold with God—a bond signified in part by circumcision.
Clopper said in the videos his speech Wednesday marks his “official declaration of war on our fucking covenant” and promised he would recruit an “army from our generation to wage it.” He also said he will “force” Jewish individuals to “comply” with his demand they stop circumcising their children.
Clopper said in an interview Thursday that the controversial comments and acts occurred during the last half hour of a two-and-a-half hour performance.
“My play was about a two-hour lecture on the topic of circumcision, about a 30- minute artistic expression of my Jewish identity and sexuality,” Clopper said.
He also defended his criticisms of Judaism.
“In terms of the anti-semitic comments, early on in my play, as a Jewish man, I noted that it is very likely that people will conflate criticism with discrimination, and if I, as a Jewish man, am not allowed to criticize Jewish culture, who is?” Clopper said.
At one point, the videos show Clopper—with all his clothes removed—repeatedly mimicking various sexual acts with an inflatable sex doll while Britney Spears’s “Toxic” played in the background.
Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has been “made aware” the performance “concluded in full nudity” and is currently examining the situation.
“We take seriously a report of this nature, as it appears to violate the terms of Sanders Theatre’s entertainment license with the City of Cambridge,” Dane wrote. “We are currently engaged in a review of these reports to determine whether Harvard was provided with an accurate account of the content of Mr. Clopper’s show, prior to its production.”
Clopper said the performance was advertised as being intended for a mature audience.
“In terms of the nudity, that was about the last 20 seconds and that was meant as the punchline of a recurring trope throughout,” Clopper said in the interview. “Whether appropriate or not, this was always marketed as an adult play with explicit content, so I think there’s nothing intrinsically wrong about sexuality, nudity, or these kinds of outrageous jokes.”
Dane also acknowledged the University has received reports that “this production included anti-Semitic content.”
“We wish to make clear that Harvard does not condone the behavior or any viewpoints expressed by Mr. Clopper during his production, as such comments would be in direct conflict with the University’s values and principles of non-discrimination,” Dane wrote.
Dane declined to answer a question asking whether Harvard plans to discipline Clopper for his actions.
Clopper is a former spokesman for Foregen, the organization in whose name he booked Sanders Theatre for the show Tuesday. Foregen is a “non-profit organization founded to research and implement regenerative medical therapies for circumcised males,” according to its website.
Performances are allowed at Sanders Theatre through an annual entertainment license Harvard signs with the Cambridge License Commission. The application for the license must indicate whether the owners of the venue will permit public exposure of “the pubic area, anus, or genitals, or any simulation thereof,” according to Massachusetts General Law.
Bright-yellow posters announcing Clopper’s production went up across campus—plastered around both student residential Houses and public spaces—in the days leading up to the event. In another promotional effort, several individuals wearing inflatable full-body suits meant to resemble penises roamed Harvard Yard and Harvard Square Monday and Tuesday.
Roughly a week ago, Clopper self-uploaded videos to YouTube in which he sought to “recruit” people to “invade Harvard Yard” wearing the suits, according to the video’s title.
In the video, he offered to pay people $20 an hour to dress up in penis suits and hand out flyers advertising his show.
This article has been updated to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 3, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Eric Clopper is a current spokesman for Foregen. In fact, Clopper resigned from his position at Foregen in April.

Dear Veritawkward,I’ve been hooking up with the same guy for a couple months now and things have been great; we always go home together when we’re out at the same parties, he’s fantastic in bed, and we have a ton of chemistry. However, I’ve never interacted with him while completely sober. Lately I’ve been getting a little paranoid about our pseudo-relationship, and really want to talk to him about how I’m feeling. I don’t want to date him, but I would like to know where he stands and if he’s hooking up with other people. I want to talk about this soberly, but based off current precedent I have no idea how I’m going to be able to interact with him unless we’re drunk!Please help,Drunk in Lust
Dear Drunk in Lust, 
Believe me, I’ve heard—and had—this problem before. In a college environment, alcohol and hookups frequently go hand in hand, and that often leads to awkwardness while sober. It sounds like y’all get along great in terms of a casual hookup, but while physical attraction is key to fun flings, so is communication. Just because you don’t want to date doesn’t mean that you can’t talk to each other about topics that are important! It’s completely normal to want to know how another person perceives a casual hookup, and whether or not they are getting with other people (if not for peace of mind then simply for safety reasons).
I know this is much easier said than done, but you really just need to talk to this kid. If you want to do it soberly, ask him to get Sunday brunch after a night of hooking up. If you feel like you can only talk about this in bed, use that post-coital cuddle time to casually bring up the topic. You’ll feel a lot less stress, which people already have enough of during finals szn, and you guys will become more comfortable around each other in the process. Sounds like a win-win to me!
You got this, 
Veritawkward
(Disclaimer: While this situation sounds all right, please be aware that while intoxicated it can often be difficult to fully consent! Read up on what exactly consent is on Harvard OSAPR’s website.)
Dear Veritawkward,Don’t judge me for this, but I’ve been leading a girl on for a couple of weeks now because I can’t find the right way to tell her I’m not into it anymore. We casually hooked up twice, which was totally fine, but I’m not interested in pursuing anything more. She keeps texting me to hang out, I keep having to make new excuses as to why I can’t, and it’s just getting tiring. How can I break it to her that I’m done without making a huge deal out of the situation?Sincerely,Finals F**kboi
Dear Finals F**kboi, 
So I never pass judgement, but I will tell you something you most likely already know: leading another person on is never cool. Try to flip the situation and imagine what it would feel like to be pining after someone who keeps baiting you with responses but never following through. Sounds exhausting and frustrating, right? I know—or rather, I hope—that you don’t want to hurt this girl, so you just need to rip that band-aid off and tell her that you’re not interested.
Letting a person down is a difficult art, and if done poorly can have some pretty rough consequences. Since you guys seem to be communicating solely through text, I feel like it’s alright to break the news that way. However, in the case that you guys were used to seeing each other in person, even rarely, I would completely advise doing it face-to-face. It’s more considerate, and easier to gauge someone’s reaction, plus you avoid the misinterpretation that often plagues texting. If you are going to send a text, just be straightforward: let her know that you’re not looking to pursue anything, or that you don’t have time for a relationship. Don’t pad the text with apologies or compliments because that will only send mixed messages.
If you genuinely want to let her know she’s a cool person, that’s fine, but don’t go overboard. It may sound obvious, but being as clear as possible is the best way to handle this, and a foolproof way to avoid making things worse. But dude, seriously, let her know soon. Don’t keep leading this girl on through finals. Do the right thing.
Good luck, 
Veritawkward
