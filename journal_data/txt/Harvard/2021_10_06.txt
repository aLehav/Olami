After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the silliest memories I have of my younger brother is him walking in the field below our house on the day before his birthday. He excitedly exclaimed, “I cannot wait for Christmas!” My father and I broke out laughing, “Lowell! Your birthday is tomorrow, why don’t we enjoy that first?” My brother’s response was not one of greed, but rather of excitement for the build up to the holiday. In other words, he was ready to be ready for Christmas.
In this regard, my brother and I share a similar trait. I, too, have been guilty of waiting to wait, such as looking forward to graduate school applications after just getting into college. My impression of Harvard students at large is of fulfilling philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre’s description of the essence of humanity. In Being and Nothingness, he says, “… it is necessary to consider our life as being made up not only of waitings but of waitings which themselves wait for waitings.”
It is worth considering how applicable Sartre’s necessity is to our own lives. We wait to wait for our friend tomorrow. We wait to go home for break so that we can wait to go back to school. We wait to apply for a job which we will use to wait to go to business school where we will wait to start working. Herein lies the source of many people’s unhappiness.
The apothegm of living in the present is doled out to the point of asininity. There is certainly truth to it, however, that truth is obscured by its overprescription. By the time you have managed to consciously focus on the present, the moment is lost, and you have failed. This could be due to the moment. It could be due to you. One soon finds, the best moments are ones in which there is no waiting; no having to focus. The time flies. You look down at the time and are startled. It's already dark; the evening is almost over.
One of the places we most routinely wait to wait is with our friends. As college students, we often find ourselves using friends to fill time between other events. Every student who has ever eaten in a dining hall surely has at least one friend whom they text to come eat with them. Is this because they require their company? Or because they do not want to eat alone?
In Lebanese-American poet Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet”, Gibran’s prophet encapsulates this issue (and its solution) well: “For what is your friend that you should seek [them] with hours to kill? Seek [them] always with hours to live.” Seeking out with hours to live is a useful notion for both friendship and life.
A friend of mine once remarked that there are not enough “people who do cool sh**” at Harvard. A nicer formulation of this is that too many people are waiting to wait. Not enough of us have entered the final state that Sartre ascribes to us: “A repose which would be being and no longer a waiting for being.” This final term is something that we can lose sight of if focusing on the minutia or if spending too much time planning our waitings.
Many of these waitings are good plans: go to graduate school, write a thesis, get a postdoctoral position, become a professor; or the more common, do investment banking for two years, get an MBA, go into private equity, return as a managing director. None of them address how to assume the final repose, how to “come to oneself,” as Sartre calls it.
This is not to say that these plans are flawed or that people should not make them. Instead, it is to encourage a certain amount of zooming out through leaning in. While this act may seem at odds with itself, it is through the proper appreciation of the everyday, the friends in our lives, that we find ourselves truly living.
It is no easy task to come to oneself. In many ways, we are encouraged by our surroundings to wait for the waiting. As with many things, there is an act of balancing. Sometimes we need to wait, sometimes wait to wait. Sometimes we should be excited to wait for Christmas to come.
All of us, however, are routinely given opportunities, sometimes as simple as a fall walk with a friend, to grasp our hours to live; to stop waiting. We should see Sartre’s necessitation not as an admonition, but a challenge. Be better scholars. Be better friends. Be better at being.

No, seems to be the answer. The question of “Who can write what?” comes up in my English classes more often than I like, forcing me to push back against the champions of (white) artistic freedom. The oppressed cannot speak for themselves, so their voice must be adopted by the white hand. It amuses me how naive this stance’s defenders are when they call upon objectivity, believing that the art they produce has no repercussions, no politics, no subjectivity. Let us retire this discourse and practice: do not speak for the oppressed.
In her essay “Can the Subaltern Speak?”, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak presents the Western practice of investigating non-Western cultures through Western “universal” concepts and frameworks. At its basis, she argues that Western academic thinking is produced to support Western economic interests, holding that knowledge expresses the economic interests of its producer. As a postcolonial writer, Spivak’s essay suggests that the knowledge production of non-Western cultures in the West is colonial; defining the “Other” and their culture through the white gaze.
Spivak engages in a discourse on “sati,” the Hindu practice of a widow sacrificing herself with her deceased husband, and constructs the brilliant phrase “White men are saving brown women from brown men” to generalize the approach of Western knowledge on non-Western peoples. The Western voice is perceived as superior to that of the oppressed, who are not given space to speak for themselves.
Literature, as a form of knowledge production, adopts this same framework of colonization, where white people reap the benefits of oppressed voices when they write from oppressed experiences unknown to them. The benefits do not have to strictly be monetary compensation earned from sales: It comes in access to a new social network. Other consequences include producing a representation of a people (and causes) unknown to you, and trampling the voice of someone who may have wanted to speak but was not allowed to.
I do not mean that one should only write from what they know, nor do I mean that one should only write about members of their own race and culture. White writers should not be replacing oppressed perspectives and it should be recognized that these writers are writing from the "oppressor" identity even if they aren't an oppressor themselves.
It is challenging for white authors to use Black and brown characters in their work accurately because they see these characters under their white gaze. Take “American Dirt” by Jeanine Cummins for example. It is the tale of an upperclass Mexican family’s escape to the United States as undocumented immigrants, fleeing a drug cartel after their leader murders her journalist husband — all written by a white woman. What did Cummins know about oppressed Mexicans? Immigration? Mexican cartels? Likely she knew what the Western media and white gaze allowed her to know. Because it is a near impossible task for white writers to articulate and represent the dynamics of non-Western cultures.
I will accept that white authors can write about non-white characters in their work; however, the work must not be centered on the politics of those peoples. Jane Austen wrote about white people white-people-ing even when they were above her class, and this was not problematic because she dove into the dynamics of her own race and realm of experience!
The bottom line is that white writers speaking for the oppressed is not trivial. You cannot remove politics from literature and literature from its impact; literature impacts politics which dictate our material conditions, which can decide whether many of us live or die. Some argue that we should put aside our differences and enjoy a good read over a cup of coffee without race, class, gender, and sexuality weighing in. The shadow of “putting aside our differences” discourse lingers in this discussion of who can write what. However, these differences are often the very object of people’s oppression. Hair, color, and fatness are politicized in our world. What makes you think that something as concrete and long-lasting as literature is not? Literature impacts how we as a society think, and thus is inherently political. We breathe politics. How could we set it aside?
This discourse is important and necessary; I am just tired of being the only one defending it every time it comes up in my classes. Let us reexamine “artistic freedom” after shedding the Western universality and objectivity attached to it. I now look to the Harvard English department — and any other departments producing art — to implement this discourse and do right by the oppressed. Acknowledge the harm caused by a white writer using the voice of the oppressed, or when possible, don't give them that space altogether. Integrate race, class, gender, and sexuality into the literary pedagogy instead of doing the occasional unit. I am optimistic about the work that the English department has done and can do. This is just another step along the path to creating the best version of our beautiful department.

Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 lauded HMS faculty, affiliates, students, and staff for their work during the Covid-19 pandemic and reiterated institutional values in his State of the School address over Zoom Tuesday.
“More than anything, I want to express my gratitude for all that each and every one of you has done and continues to do to ensure the health and safety of our community throughout every phase of this unremitting pandemic,” he said in his address.
HMS, along with the rest of the University, shifted to virtual learning in March 2020. To prepare for a high volume of coronavirus patients, fourth-year students were given the option to graduate in April 2020 to join the medical workforce as quickly as possible.
Last year’s first-year medical cohort started their fall semester remotely, though they were invited on campus in January due to the hands-on nature of their curriculum. HMS has since transitioned to primarily in-person instruction this fall.
In the address, Daley said HMS was emerging from a decade of financial difficulties following the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 when he joined as dean in 2017. According to Daley, HMS leadership and the finance team conceived a plan to combat instability.
HMS reached its capital campaign goal of $750 million in Feb. 2018, amid concerns over a residual financial toll from the $260 million New Research Building that opened in 2003.
Following the success of the School’s financial recovery plan, he said, the Blavatnik Family Foundation donated $200 million in late 2018 — the largest gift in the school’s history.
HMS has channeled the funds toward IT infrastructure, digital systems, and research, Daley said. He also argued the School’s reinvigorated financial situation allowed them to respond to the pandemic in meaningful ways.
“With these basic building blocks in place, HMS was well-positioned when the pandemic hit, poised to nimbly redirect our efforts towards a comprehensive, all-out assault on the coronavirus,” he said.
Daley said the pandemic showed the importance of collaboration, citing collaborative efforts such as the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, HMS’s $30 million alliance with pharmaceutical company AbbVie to study and develop therapies to address viral infections like Covid-19, and faculty cohort hires.
Daley also noted HMS’s numerous efforts to promote “a climate of inclusion and belonging” by improving recruitment and retention and adopting new promotions criteria. He highlighted that HMS faculty have been working to promote equity in healthcare delivery, particularly during the pandemic.
One of the key tenets of the HMS mission, Daley said, is making scientific and medical education “accessible to all.” He said HMS expanded scholarship opportunities for admitted students and saw an increase in enrollment this past year.
“We’re focused on ensuring that no medical student graduates with such burdensome debt that their career choice is dictated more by financial need than by idealism and a desire to serve,” Daley said.
He added that HMS is “seeking a visionary donor” that can facilitate the goal of educational accessibility. His plea for donations follows recent gifts by alumni to Harvard’s Economics Department and the Asian American studies program.
Additionally, Daley said HMS’s financial “vigor” would create a stable foundation for research and education. He noted departments have already cut costs and that HMS has diversified its funding sources.
“We must achieve financial vigor and robustness,” he said. “This priority is the pedestal for which we can watch our greatest ambitions for the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An early September Covid-19 surge led to “nail-biting” moments for administrators, but Harvard has dodged “severe” cases of Covid-19 among vaccinated students this semester, University officials said during a faculty meeting Tuesday.
In May, administrators announced that Harvard would return to “normal housing density” and full in-person instruction in the fall. At the same time, the University mandated Covid-19 vaccinations to return to campus housing, barring medical or religious exemptions.
Nonetheless, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said University health officials were “thrown some curveballs” in planning for a safe return for students, such as the Delta variant and its effect on unvaccinated students.
“If you were to ask me what the biggest concern I had was: ‘Could we prevent an outbreak that might force us to shut down campus?’” Garber said. “There were some nail-biting moments, particularly around Labor Day.”
Currently, 96 percent of University employees and 95 percent of students are vaccinated, while the seven-day positivity rate has remained under 0.2 percent the entire semester, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said. No vaccinated students who have contracted the virus have required ICU or ventilator usage this semester.
Despite falling case numbers in recent weeks, Nguyen said Harvard officials are not “ready to say we’re ready to get back to normal yet.”
Garber said “no single factor” will determine when Harvard operations can fully return to normal, including more travel and conferences. Though experts predict the virus will eventually become endemic like the flu, Harvard will have to consider when the “rate of serious long Covid is low enough” to fully reopen, he said.
“I’m not ready to say we are going to be [back to normal] by January, but I don’t think it’s unrealistic,” Garber said.
The University is also considering the fact that some affiliates are now eligible for a Covid-19 booster dose, he said, noting that preliminary research has found “the coverage against new variants is extremely good” for those who receive booster shots.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Garber also provided an update on negotiations with the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. Last week, roughly 92 percent of HGSU-UAW members voted to authorize a strike after nearly six months of contract negotiations with the administration.
On economic issues, the greatest disagreement lies in “direct compensation and salary.”
“A gap remains to be sure, but the University has offered $14 million in new economic concessions over the next three years,” Garber said.
Garber said two sides were “far apart” on non-economic issues, including union security, third-party arbitration for academic retaliation, and “the broad series of issues concerning non-discrimination, harassment, and intimidation.”
Garber said previous negotiations with HGSU-UAW led to schools developing “policies and procedures for student accusations of academic retaliation.” He said, however, that the administration opposes the union’s demands for third-party arbitration in those cases, arguing that arbitrators are “not in a place” to determine whether faculty actions are appropriate.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay shared tentative plans in case the union moves to strike. She stressed that faculty are “responsible for maintaining continuity of lectures, sections, and evaluation.”
“If it happens that a strike begins, the first thing you should do is to let [students] know what to do and what to expect. If your building is picketed, we’re prepared to make exceptions to move class to Zoom,” Gay said. “You should be thinking about how to handle sections, such as adapting assignments since you have fewer staff.”
Gay said that although moving back to in-person instruction could be “a lot to process” or “draining” for faculty, she said it was a “hard-won moment” worthy of celebration.
“Classrooms are activated. The Yard is humming. Students are so grateful to finally be back together. And the energy here is palpable,” she added.

Tickets sold out to the Nigerian Students Association’s 12th annual Nigerian Independence Day Gala last Saturday, hosted in Northwest Labs.
Around 400 students from Harvard and other universities like Boston College and Yale attended the festivities, which included dance performances, spoken word poetry, a fashion show, and an afterparty in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. This year, the gala centered around the theme of “Soro Soke,” which translates to “speak up” in Yoruba.
To adhere to Covid-19 guidelines, NSA required vaccination and for attendees to provide proof of a negative test, as well as wear masks for the afterparty, per organizers.
NSA vice president Nnaemeka “Nana” Anyanwu ’23 said he was thankful that the group was able to hold the event in person this year after the virtual Independence Day Gala held last year.
“While it was still relatively successful especially in the online format, it obviously wasn’t the same,” Anyanwu said. “Being able to celebrate our culture in the same building and in the same place together is really one of the most powerful aspects about it.”
The event featured two keynote speakers: Olufemi O. Vaughan, a professor at Amherst College who oversees its Black Studies program, and Chidi C. Achebe, a doctor who runs Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center, a health clinic in Dorchester, Mass.
Chinaza K. Asiegbu ’22 said the fashion show is a long-running tradition at the gala and serves the purpose of showcasing another aspect of African art through clothing.
“A lot of people in the audience were asking about the fashions and where I got my dress or where other people got their tops and pants,” Asiegbu said. “So it really is exposing people, even people who don’t know anything about African culture, to what Africa has to offer in the fashion world.”
Typically, NSA collaborates with a local African artist that helps design and coordinate the pieces for the show, she added.
Asiegbu said that walking in the fashion show allowed her to feel proud of both her Nigerian heritage but also of how diverse her culture is.
“I think it’s just so empowering to have people of different genders just walking and having a lot of pride in their culture,” Aseigbu said. “Also, the crowd’s energy is always amazing.”
The gala also featured spoken word poetry from Remka Y. Nwana ’23, a new song by Jaeschel O. Acheampong ’24, and performances by Uzo L. Ngwu ’23 and Omo Naija X Wahala Boys, Harvard’s Nigerian dance troupe.
The gala was also a charity fundraising event. This year, NSA chose to raise money for Lagos Food Bank, a nonprofit which fights hunger and malnutrition in Lagos, Nigeria.
The NSA raised over $5,000 for the organization, per Anyanwu.
Gala attendee Maya E. Counter ’24 wrote in an email that she thought the Gala was “vibrant and fun.”
NSA president Olayeni C. Oladipo ’23 said the NSA hopes to engage more with Harvard students in upcoming events.
“We were happy that everybody had a good time,” Oladipo said. “We’re looking forward to engaging more with communities at Harvard and outside of Harvard in the future.”

Almost 100 acres of Harvard-owned land in Allston currently occupied by the Massachusetts Turnpike will be made available for development, thanks to a turnpike redesign plan selected by the Mass. Department of Transportation last week after eight years of deliberation.
In a Sept. 29 announcement, the Department of Transportation said it will move forward with a design plan that straightens and lowers the roadway to ground level. The plan, called an “at-grade” option, will ditch the existing elevated viaduct in favor of a side-by-side freeway and pedestrian boardwalk along the Charles River bank. The design will straighten the turnpike, which currently curves through a 91-acre plot of Harvard land known as Allston Landing South.
Harvard, which previously advocated for a ground-level design, applauded last week’s decision.
“The Modified At-Grade design option has benefited from strong support across the community and is a pivotal step toward realizing a shared vision for creating neighborhood connectivity, expanding green space, increasing regional transit opportunities, and enabling new economic development potential for the region,” University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement.
The University acquired the Allston Landing South property in 2003 but was unable to move forward with development due to legal restrictions that limited the property’s use to exclusively railroad operations.
The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority selected the site in 2014 as the location for “West Station,” a proposed commuter rail station that will connect Allston to South Station along the existing Framingham/Worcester line. Harvard has committed $58 million to date to fund the new station.
The selection of the ground-level redesign plan last week marks a big step in clearing the way for the station, as well as opening up dozens of previously undeveloped acres for Harvard’s use.
“The project presents a transformative opportunity that will benefit not only the City of Boston, but also the entire region,” O’Rourke wrote. “Harvard looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Commonwealth as this work advances in the months ahead.”
State Representative Michael J. Moran, a Democrat critical of Harvard’s development plans in Allston, lauded the decision to ground the highway, saying that it was the option supported by his constituents and local advocates.
“It provides the best option, in my opinion, for a vibrant and well thought out West Station, as well as the ability for Harvard to properly plan the 100 or so acres that they’re going to receive from the straightening of the Mass. Pike,” Moran said in an interview with The Crimson.
The state’s announcement comes as Harvard is seeking approval from the City of Boston for a proposed 900,000-square-foot, mixed-use development called the Enterprise Research Campus. The school has received forceful pushback from elected officials and civic groups in the neighborhood, who have argued that Harvard has not engaged with residents enough, leaving them in the dark about the University’s long-term plans in the area.
On Monday, though, Moran expressed hope that Harvard’s vast property holdings in Allston — roughly one-third of the neighborhood — would give residents and officials a better ability to influence the school’s development plans.
“That is the good part about Harvard owning all that land,” Moran said.

Harvard has begun administering the flu vaccine but said it is not providing Covid-19 booster shots currently due to a “limited supply” of Covid-19 vaccine doses.
Harvard University Health Services Chief Medical Officer Soheyla D. Gharib wrote in an email to patients Tuesday that Harvard is “focusing” on providing the Covid-19 vaccine to University affiliates who have yet to receive their first or second doses, and encouraged individuals eligible to receive a booster dose to seek out alternative providers.
“Unfortunately, HUHS has a limited supply of vaccine and we are currently focusing on patients who have not received their first or second doses,” Gharib wrote.
As of Sept. 22, 95 percent of Harvard students and 96 percent of employees were fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the University’s Covid-19 web page. Harvard requires vaccination against Covid-19 for all affiliates and administered the vaccine to individuals who were unable to secure doses prior to their arrival on campus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends a Covid-19 booster shot for the following groups of people who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine more than six months ago: people who are aged 65 years and older; adults with underlying medical conditions; adults living in long-term care facilities; and adults at increased risk of Covid-19 exposure.
The CDC also recommends a booster shot for immunocompromised people who received the second dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at least 28 days ago.
People eligible for a booster can receive the additional shot at several health clinics located in Cambridge and the surrounding area, including Central Square’s CVS, Star Market, and the Cambridge Health Alliance Somerville Vaccine Center.
In her email, Gharib also wrote that HUHS is holding its annual flu vaccination clinics on Mondays and Tuesdays from noon to 3 p.m. for the remainder of the fall semester, as influenza season approaches. Vaccine clinics are located on the second floor of the Smith Campus Center. Affiliates must schedule an appointment on the HUHS patient portal website or via phone call in advance to receive the flu vaccine.
Patients seemed eager to take advantage of Harvard’s vaccination services.
Flu vaccine clinics began operating Monday, and as of Tuesday night, the earliest available flu shot appointment on the HUHS patient portal was Nov. 2.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is working to provide additional flu vaccine clinics to meet student demand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston and Cambridge-area arts professionals discussed the ability of new kinds of monuments to “contribute to the formation of a positive collective identity” at a Harvard Ed Portal panel on Tuesday.
The panel, based on the Ed Portal’s recent “Monuments Reimagined” exhibit, included Cambridge-based artist Katherine Megumi Shozawa, Harvard Graduate School of Design Professor Sara Zewde, and the City of Boston’s Chief of Arts and Culture Kara Elliot-Ortega.
The panel started with a discussion of the role of what Shozawa termed “old public art,” like large statues and plazas. These are “reminders of dominant norms, colonial narratives, conditional citizenship and naturalization, and civic and cultural infrastructure that are not inclusive yet,” Shozawa said.
“​​Growing up on the Pacific Coast in a multiracial family that is Japanese, Canadian, and Coast Salish First Nations, I understood early on that old public art, monuments, memorials were not for me,” Shozawa added.
The discussion then moved on to how newer monuments can help to reinforce shared civic identities.
Elliot-Ortega defined that sort of monument as “creativity being enacted in the public sphere.” That can take place through “creating together in public spaces, or other kinds of interventions that create that kind of ‘creative civicness’ together in public,” Elliot-Ortega said.
In order to make new monuments that can unite people under a shared civic identity, the panelists urged a broadening of the idea of what constitutes a monument. In that spirit, Shozawa is concerned with directly engaging the viewers of her artworks, she said. This was true of a piece she contributed to the “Monuments Reimagined” exhibit, a pink neon sign that spells “belong.”
“There was an area where people could sit,” she said. “As people, passersby, commuters, residents, students found a place to sit, they arranged themselves in relation to that work.”
“I think of it as the opposite of the conventional monuments, and the ways they make us feel,” Shozawa added. “I also think a lot about the assumptions of belonging in public and private spaces – who feels welcome and who does not.”
The panelists also broached the fraught debate about the removal of monuments with ties to slavery and the Confederacy.
“The process of taking down could be the artwork itself,” Shozawa said.
Elliot-Ortega noted that “local artists responding or doing their own kind of creation or erasure around some of the existing monuments” could be another way to address those objectionable monuments.
In this way, people can “fight the urge to stay stuck in the ‘is it good or is it bad’ conversation about monuments,” she said.
But no monument – not even the new ones – should be exempt from public scrutiny and criticism in the future, Zewde said.
“When you think about time and longer arcs of history, I certainly hope anything that we, on this call, build, gets torn down one day,” she added.

Dominated by stockyards and rail lines before 1900, the 20th century transformed Allston: waves of immigration made it one of Boston’s most diverse neighborhoods, filled with single- and multi-family homes.
The 21st century threatens to transform Allston yet again, this time displacing some of those very residents who gave the area its unique identity.
In 2011, the average home in Allston cost approximately $350,000. Just eight years later, in 2019, that figure had risen to $500,000, a 43 percent jump. Meanwhile, median rent surged from $1,279 to $1,740, a 36 percent increase, according to data compiled by the Boston Department of Neighborhood Development using five-year estimates from American Community Survey.
Rising housing costs are only one factor — alongside a rapid increase in household income — that points to Allston’s gentrification.
In the same eight-year period ending in 2019, the neighborhood’s median household income spiked 67 percent — from $37,487 to $62,614 — suggesting either an influx of high-income or an egress of low-income earners.
Researchers have found that minority populations bear a disproportionate burden of such gentrification, which Allston’s demographics partially reflect.
Though its proportion of white residents has decreased since 2000, Allston remains majority white, and its Black and Hispanic populations have consistently represented only a small fraction of total residents, per U.S. Census data.
The actor which may well define Allston’s 21st century trajectory is Harvard, which, following a spree of land purchases beginning in the late 1990s, is now the neighborhood’s largest single landowner. The University presently owns more land in Allston than Cambridge.
Some residents argue that Harvard’s expansion lies at the root of the gentrification, while the University points to its efforts to build and maintain affordable housing in Allston. It remains to be seen, however, whether the University can keep pace with the rate of displacement and rising costs.
Anthony P. “Tony” D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association, has witnessed both Allston’s rapid 20th-century growth and its more recent gentrification from the porch of his Raymond Street home, which his family has owned since his father’s return from World War II.
For D’Isidoro, the lack of affordable housing is “restrictive” and has pushed out locals who can no longer afford the neighborhood.
“When we’re seeing displacement of people out of the city, because we’re making it so absolutely absurdly ridiculous for them to stay here, that is just not fair,” he said.
D’Isidoro, who is also a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, alleged local universities — including Harvard — have placed upward pressure on the housing market by not housing all students on campus.
“Harvard, I think, professes 90 percent of the students are housed on campus, but a lot of grad students live off campus,” he said.
“The next mayor has to be more successful than [former Boston] Mayor [Martin J.] Walsh was in getting these colleges and universities to take more responsibility for their students in terms of housing,” he added.
James Stockard, a lecturer at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, said the University’s expansion into Allston has increased rental prices. The neighborhood is an “increasingly popular” neighborhood for students, including those at the Business School and those using the newly-opened Science and Engineering Complex, he said.
“More people would like to live nearby [meaning] there’s more competition for any given home and therefore prices go up,” Stockard said. “So in general prices have been going up in Allston, and Harvard’s expansion there will inevitably cause them to go up even more.”
For its part, the University has invested tens of millions since 2000 into its Harvard Local Housing Collaborative, which aims to increase affordable housing stock in Allston and create economic opportunity for low- to middle-income residents. In 2019, it recommitted $20 million to the initiative.
The University also donated a 30,000-square-foot parcel on 90 Antwerp Street for a development including 12 affordable units, and pledged to devote a tract of land spanning 65 to 79 Seattle St. to a homeownership development that will be designed with the input of local residents.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement Harvard “remains committed to working with its host communities to address the region’s high cost of housing and creating homeownership opportunities.”
Mimi Musa, a local resident who said she was relocated by Harvard, lauded the University’s programs for low-income residents in Allston.
“When I grew up here, when I was in the old community, which was considered like ‘projects,’ Harvard did a lot for us,” she said. “They had many programs, college funding, college grants, scholarships that they offered to us, and only us.”
At the same time, Musa added, she believes the University’s support has waned and said she feels isolated from the areas of Allston that Harvard is newly developing.
The responsibility for ameliorating resident frustration, per D’Isidoro, lies with the highest levels of University administration, including President Lawrence S. Bacow.
“President Bacow, if you own a third of Allston, my God, you owe some time with us,” he said.
In a recent interview with The Crimson, Bacow defended his engagement with Allston residents and officials, noting that “there’s only one me, and I try and spread myself around.”
According to the city data, Allston has consistently maintained low home ownership rates compared to the rest of Boston, only nudging up one percent from 13.5 in 2011 to 14.5 percent in 2019. Boston’s owner occupancy rate averages 35 percent citywide, while the national average stands at 65.4 percent.
D’Isidoro said low owner occupancy rates might jeopardize the neighborhood’s cohesion and political participation.
“In terms of civic engagement and stability, homeownership is very important,” he said. “Being able to have young people build wealth and stay in our community for the long term is important.”
“I have nothing against my rental friends, but, my god, we just need to restore some balance,” he added.
Local resident Lauren Gardiner said she was unsure if she would ever be able to own a home in the city because it is out of her price range. She added the City of Boston owes residents more transparency.
“Just being transparent about the housing crisis [as] a whole, we have an insane amount of homeless individuals,” Gardiner said.
According to Stockard, the housing demand in Boston is much greater than the supply, “so prices go up like crazy.”
To remedy this, he suggested that the city allow for higher density developments, such as five-to-seven-story mid-rise buildings. If such developments are undertaken by private, for-profit developers, however, they will impose the highest rents the market allows.
“As long as there are plenty of private developers around, they will not leave any money on the table,” Stockard said. “What we need to do is shift the ownership of more and more multi-family buildings into the hands of nonprofit organizations, and public agencies.”
The city of Cambridge allows nonprofits and public agencies to “get in the game” and bid for land through its Affordable Housing Overlay, Stockard said. The initiative, which the City Council approved in 2020, permits developments to be denser than what is allowed at market rate, as long as they consist of 100 percent affordable housing.
Jason Desrosier, community building and engagement manager at the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, said major policy changes are needed to reverse the trends of the affordable housing crisis.
Some of those changes could include removing “restrictive zoning practices” and broadening the city of Boston’s Inclusionary Development Policy, Desrosier said. Last updated in 2015, the policy states that any new development with 10 or more units must either set aside 13 percent of units for affordable housing, create affordable housing units at another location off-site, or contribute to the IDP fund, which funds affordable housing across Boston.
“We need to also increase the tools in our collective toolbox — there’s not one policy that can remedy the situation,” Desrosier said. “You need to make sure that you have tenant protections in place so that as you’re building housing for different income types, folks who are at the lower incomes in the private market are not being pushed out.”
Stockard said Harvard could contribute to lowering rent prices in Allston by housing more graduate students on campus.
“There’s no question that if Harvard instantly tomorrow housed all of its graduate students, rents would go down in Allston,” Stockard said.
Removing students from the housing market would not completely solve the problem of high rents, given that Allston remains a desirable place to live for faculty, staff and others, but it “would help,” he said.
Desrosier said institutions like Harvard and developers need to be “truly inclusive” with their community engagement efforts and tap into existing local networks and organizations to liaise with residents.
“There are organizations and community groups in the neighborhood that can work in partnership with these institutions or these developers to make sure that they’re truly engaging residents in a meaningful way,” Desrosier said.
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident, said the onus is ultimately on Harvard and its developers to make their commitments to keeping the neighborhood affordable a reality.
“Results are what matters,” he said. “It’s hard to judge how much any person or institution cares about something else just from words.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than 18 months off the ice, the Harvard University men’s hockey team will return as one of the teams to beat in ECAC Hockey this winter.
The Crimson, which played its last regular-season game on Feb. 29, 2020, and last game altogether on March 7, 2020, in the ECAC Tournament first round, was picked to finish third in the ECAC preseason coaches poll, receiving three first-place votes. Harvard finished behind Quinnipiac and Clarkson, both of which played in shortened seasons during the pandemic last winter while Harvard — along with the rest of the Ivy League, Rensselaer, and Union — was away from the ice. St. Lawrence and Colgate also skated with the Bobcats and Golden Knights to round out the four-team Covid-19 ECAC.
“I think there’s a certain energy and excitement around the team early on that’s been a real breath of fresh air,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 last week at the league’s media day conference call. “I think everybody’s really excited to kick the season off.”
Harvard was one of five different teams that received first-place votes in the coaches poll, marking the first time since the 2013-14 season that as many squads earned top picks. Quinnipiac, the ECAC’s defending champion from last year’s pandemic-stricken campaign, topped the survey for the first time since the 2016-17 season.
The top vote-getter’s head coach, Rand Pecknold, who is entering his 28th season with the Bobcats, looked towards Harvard with his vote, granting the Crimson one of its three first-place selections.
“Harvard is absolutely loaded,” Pecknold said. “I voted for them one. I think they might be one of the most talented teams in the country.”
Along with the coaches, the media members who cover the ECAC also conducted another preseason poll, which placed the Crimson tied for second with Quinnipiac, with both schools receiving three first-place votes. Clarkson claimed the top spot in the media list. While the media and coaches polls featured the same top four (Cornell claimed the fourth spot in both), the discrepancies do not come as a surprise, especially this year given the uncertainty created by a partial 2020-21 ECAC campaign.
With two-thirds of the league off the ice last year, some coaches said making poll selections ahead of this season presented a challenge beyond the usual guessing game that the preseason predictions present.
“It was hard to pick the teams because these teams haven’t played,” Pecknold said. “You’re kind of guessing a little bit. I know Harvard, with all that talent; I know Clarkson is going to be great. Those were easy. Cornell is always good. They’re so well-coached and they’ve got that culture and they do a good job. But it was difficult picking who else was going to fit where.”
Donato echoed Pecknold’s sentiment.
“Quite possibly, more than any other year, the poll is a little bit of blindly throwing darts at a board,” Donato said.
The projections did not end with team standings, however, as the league also named a preseason All-ECAC squad. Harvard forward Nick Abruzzese and defenseman Henry Thrun, both juniors, were named to this preseason all-league team last week. Abruzzese is coming off of a head-turning freshman campaign during which he notched 14 goals and 30 assists in 31 games, making him the top-scoring first-year in the country and earning him ECAC and Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors. Thrun is also coming off of a strong freshman year, during which he notched three goals and 18 assists from the blue line. One-third of the entire all-conference preseason lineup came from the Crimson as only six players total were named. Quinnipiac also had two skaters selected, and Clarkson and St. Lawrence each contributed a player to round out the list.
Without a season last winter, the Crimson will be integrating two classes that have never played Harvard hockey before, including a group of freshmen that has turned heads as one of the region’s top recruiting classes. First-year forward Matthew Coronato will highlight Harvard’s class of 2025 after a summer that saw him selected 13th overall in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. The Calgary Flames selection is the highest NHL pick ever in Harvard men’s hockey history and just the third first-rounder the program has seen.
“The guys don’t look at it as a challenge, they’re looking at it as an opportunity just to get back on the ice, to have some sort of normalcy,” said Donato of bringing the large group of new players together. “I think that there’s real excitement and energy. I think the guys have put in a lot of work over the time off, and we’re hoping to hit the ground running.”
In an interview with The Crimson in May, on the issue of integrating two new classes at the same time, Thrun pointed to the importance of leadership from returning players.
“Having almost two freshmen classes, or half your team being new to college hockey — I think that's really going to make it reliant upon the upperclassmen to take a leadership role,” Thrun said. “At the end of the day, it’s a 30-game season, and every game matters. ... The juniors and seniors are going to have to do a really good job this year of steering the ship in the right direction and making sure that everyone’s on the same page.”
Besides the polls, all-conference team announcement, and interviews with coaches, the media day also featured a brief review of league rules, highlighted by a note on overtime. In the summer of 2020, the NCAA changed overtime rules for men’s and women’s college hockey to feature a five-minute, three-on-three session to be followed by a shootout in tournament and conference games only. In an ECAC context, a team would earn three league points for a regulation win, two points for an overtime or shootout win, one point for an overtime or shootout loss, and zero points for a regulation loss. Previously, in the 2019-20 ECAC campaign, teams earned two points for a win, one point for a tie, and zero points for a loss. Given that the Crimson did not compete last season, this year will mark the first season for Harvard under the updated overtime rules.
