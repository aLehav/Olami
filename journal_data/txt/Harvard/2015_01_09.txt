After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is one step closer to playing a part in the Olympic Games.
The United States Olympic Committee selected Boston as the United States’ bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games on Thursday. If Boston is chosen out of the worldwide pool of bids to host the Games, Harvard Stadium may serve as the venue for field hockey.
"It is an exceptional honor for Boston to be chosen as the U.S. representative in the running for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This selection is in recognition of our city's talent, diversity, and global leadership,” Boston Mayor Martin “Marty” J. Walsh said in a statement Thursday. “Our goal is to host an Olympic and Paralympic Games that are innovative, walkable, and hospitable to all. Boston hopes to welcome the world's greatest athletes to one of the world's great cities."
Boston beat out Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., for the U.S. bid. Rome has confirmed its bid, and other potential candidate cities include Paris, Istanbul, Berlin, and Hamburg, among others, according to USA Today. The International Olympic Committee will make the final selection in 2017, according to a U.S. Olympic Committee press release.
In order to fulfill IOC requirements, Boston 2024 organizers would need to construct a new 60,000 seat stadium, which they say could be disassembled, dispersed, and repurposed once the Olympics are over.
According to the Associated Press, organizers say the city can fund the Olympics with an estimated $4.2 billion in revenue from broadcast revenues, ticket sales, and international sponsorships in conjunction with $3.2 billion from other sponsorships.
If selected, Boston 2024 organizers plan to utilize existing locations such as Fenway Park and Boston Common, according to the AP. Other universities around Boston and Cambridge would also likely play roles in the Olympics.
Not everyone is so enthused with the prospect of Boston hosting the Games, however: A group called No Boston Olympics argues that hosting the Olympics is a poor investment of public resources.
Harvard’s executive vice president, Katherine N. Lapp, serves on Boston 2024’s college and university engagement committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (9-3) righted the ship Monday with a 46-point thrashing of Saint Rose—the team’s largest-ever victory under coach Tommy Amaker—but faces a bigger challenge in Hanover, NH as it starts conference play Saturday against Dartmouth (7:00 p.m., Ivy League Digital Network). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard starts the “14-game tournament”.
Off the Mat: After finishing seventh or worse in the Ivy League for four consecutive years, Dartmouth rose to sixth last year without star big man Gabas Maldunas, who was sidelined for the entire conference season. Dartmouth notched back-to-back at Yale and Brown to close out the season, and with the exception of its two games against Harvard (two losses by a combined 46 points), was within arm’s reach (13 points or less) in each of its other losses. The Big Green are looking to rise out of the basement of the Ancient Eight this season behind its trio of double digit scorers in Alex Mitola, Connor Boehm, and Maldunas. Despite playing just 12 games, Mitola is tied for the league-lead in three-pointers made; his marksmanship and low turnover rate have given him the best offensive rating in the conference.
Cracking Down: The Crimson posted one of the most dominant Ivy League seasons in recent memory last year, outscoring its opponents by nearly 16 points a game and losing just one game all year—at home to Yale. The team’s success started on the defensive end, where it suffocated opponents to the tune of just 58.8 points a game—the second-best team, Princeton, was nearly four points worse.  This year’s team has struggled offensively but has held teams to just 38.7 percent shooting and 56.5 points a game, the latter figure good for 16th best in the country. Harvard started off last year by holding Dartmouth to 47.5 points a game in its two meetings, and it will need to come out with the same defensive energy Saturday.
Saunders Theater: Through the nonconference season, senior wing Wesley Saunders has established himself as the favorite to win Ivy League Player of the Year. Not only does he lead the conference in Win Shares and PER, he also pulls off the impressive double act of ranking second in both offensive and defensive rating. More conventional stats bear out the same thing—Saunders leads the league in steals per game and field goal percentage, while ranking third in points and fourth in assists per contest. Last year, Saunders’ POY win was a subject of debate—both Yale forward Justin Sears and Princeton guard Tyler Bray had better statistics—but the senior’s phenomenal nonconference play has put a moratorium on any doubt as to whom the frontrunner is this year.

Well this is awkward. I was going to announce it later, but it looks like the Pudding beat me to it. Amy Poehler, you are the Ridgely Room 52 Woman of the Year (WOY)! What a coincidence!
Amy, you should be honored. Room 52 is even more prestigious than the Hasty Pudding Club. We only have two members, and my roommate is out of town a lot, so it’s basically just me!
There won’t be a roast, or a pudding cup. And while I can’t throw you a parade, we can walk up the five flights of stairs to my room (there’s an elevator, but you don’t want to do that). And if you want a party, we can throw you one! I have a ton of mints from the dining hall, and we’re right above Insomnia Cookies (talk about prime real estate)! I can get booze too, although I already have a nib of something called Kinky, and a bottle of 2011 Charles Shaw.
I will invite all of my blockmates and estranged linkmates, so my common room will really feel full. “What’s a linkmate,” you ask? Don’t worry, we can spend most of the night going over Harvard lingo. Also, bring a pen! I have a book for you to sign. We just have to be done by 11p.m., because the 29th is a Thursday, and it will be quiet hours.
Amy, consider this your official invitation to Ridgley 52. I’ll be in my room all night, waiting, with the cookies.
Please come.
