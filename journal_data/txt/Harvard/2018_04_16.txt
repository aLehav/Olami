After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Surviving a mafia gang chase with fluff for brains is not an easy task, as the characters in “Game Night” consistently demonstrate. The film’s admittedly dogged attempt at lowbrow humor ultimately backfires due to its preoccupation with keeping its audience entertained, leading to unexplainable plot holes and underdeveloped characters.
While an interesting comedic take on the kidnapping mystery, the plot follows a relatively predictable pattern despite its twists, which arise so frequently they become expected. Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) are a suburban couple who host weekend game nights in their home. Regular guests include Ryan (Billy Magnussen) and his latest fling, and married couple Kevin (Lamorne Morris) and Michelle (Kylie Bunbury). One night, Max’s smarmy, rich older brother, Brooks (Kyle Chandler) invites the guests over for a more intense game night modeled after a murder mystery. After Brooks is kidnapped, the guests assume that his disappearance is just part of the game until they discover Brooks’ affiliation with the black market. What follows is a wild-goose chase for clues as the couples get caught up in their own relationship problems, a Fabergé egg, and a mafia hit list.
Several parts of the plot unfold without follow-through, adding unnecessary confusion to an otherwise uncomplicated storyline. Max and Annie decide to exclude their neighbor Gary (Jesse Plemons) from their game nights after his divorce for unbelievable reasons. What’s more unreasonable is Gary’s loyalty to his so-called friends. Despite being brutally shot in the head and miraculously coming back to life, Gary appears unfazed and still quietly fond of his friends whose recklessness led to his egregious gun wound. Not even the antagonist has any realistic motivation to be there: The Bulgarian, one of the mafia villains, should not be demanding valuable intel from Max and his friends, let alone kill them, especially when the intel is easily searchable on the Internet (as Max unintentionally shows).
In an attempt to compensate for its convoluted plot with twists that involve some variation of “Is this a game or not?” “Game Night” can’t hide the fact that without its humor, its unbacked storyline would be utterly uninteresting.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of “Game Night” is its neglect of its promising cast. While Bateman convincingly portrays a deadpan man-child and McAdams once again proves her natural penchant for wit, their characters are the only ones that have any real substance. Morris’ and Bunbury’s characters—Kevin and Michelle, a couple grappling with Kevin’s jealousy issues—are reservoirs of untapped potential that deserve more screen time and more nuanced screenwriting than what they’re given in the film. Thankfully, Morris and Bunbury, who play a couple dealing with the boyfriend’s sexual jealousy, deliver their hackneyed roles as tastefully as possible. Despite their noticeable commitment to their roles, the supporting actors and actresses cannot make for their forgettable characters’ unoriginality.
“Game Night” would be funnier if it didn’t try so hard. The film milks certain (otherwise hilarious) jokes until their humor is sucked dry. An example is Kevin’s anger when he finds out that his girlfriend slept with Denzel Washington, only for both of them to discover that her one-night stand was with Denzel lookalike. This side story would have been hysterical if not for its long run, for which the joke ultimately lost its punch. Similarly, Magnussen’s dumb blonde persona is a running gag that turns too predictable, although his unexpected decision to bring an intelligent girlfriend to game night redeems some of his value as a comedic device.


Within its tight 93-minute run time, “Game Night” does manage to squeeze in an impressive amount of (attempted) humor. Its decision to budget most of its time delivering punchy one-liners and running gags, however, comes at the detriment of its uninspiring plot.

Blumhouse Productions, the same company that produced “Get Out” in 2017, chose fitting actors for their upcoming film, “Truth or Dare.” The new release adds to Blumhouse’s horror repertoire as it follows a group of college friends who are looped into a deadly game of truth or dare: “Tell the truth, or you die. Do the dare, or you die.” Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey, stars of “Pretty Little Liars” and “Teen Wolf,” respectively, play two friends attempting to escape the game and are no strangers to supernatural thrillers and young adult humor.
“‘Pretty Little Liars’ has undertones of the horror and thriller genre within it obviously, and that’s why people love it,” Hale said. “Eight years of that made me way more comfortable within the filming of a movie like this.”
Her character, Olivia Barron, is the film’s protagonist who struggles to reconcile her moral conscience and do what is necessary to save her friends. “What I love about ‘Truth or Dare’ is that there’s a really strong female lead, and I think we need a lot more of those, so I was really excited that for once I got to play that character,” she said.
“I thought Olivia is a badass, and I don’t always feel like that in real life, so I wanted to play one,” she added.
On the other hand, Blumhouse originally cast a different actor for the role of Lucas. But when he was no longer available for the film, Blumhouse called Posey, who immediately accepted. “‘Truth or Dare’ fit right in line with ‘Teen Wolf,’ and [horror] is a genre that I just love,” he said.
Posey was drawn to the many facets of horror. “I love gore,” he said. “I love heightened energy. I love acting. And I love being covered in blood.”
Still, its lead actors say “Truth or Dare” subverts horror movie archetypes by avoiding the “stupid” decisions that often feed their plots. “There aren’t a lot of those moments in this movie where you’re like, ‘What the hell are you doing? Don’t go down that hallway,’” Posey said.
If anything, “Truth or Dare” adds a new element to the horror genre with its take on a demon that rotates through inhabiting each friend, according to its stars. “That doesn’t really happen in most scary movies,” Posey said. “You don’t get to play the antagonist and the good guy at the same time.”
Despite this premise, Hale and Posey said the cast still found ways to lighten the mood while filming. In one scene, for example, they dare their friend to give a lap dance. “One thing we got to have a lot of freedom with is the actual truth or dare game,” Posey said. “When the lap dance was happening, everyone was throwing out ad libs and we just had a lot of fun with that game. It really did feel like we were playing truth or dare because we were ad libbing stuff and trying to one up one another and make each other laugh.”
When asked about embarrassing dares they’ve done, Hale said, “Within the last couple of years I got dared to go skydiving and I did that. I haven’t had anything embarrassing because I usually choose truth."
Posey had a different answer: “Probably to show my butt… I had to do it in the movie too.”

An unfortunate series of events—filled with sugar daddies, struggles with sexual identity, and a cruel lover—come into play in “Daddy Issues,” directed by Amara Cash, an entry at the Wicked Queer Film Festival. Maya Mitchell (Madison Lawlor) is an amateur artist who dreams of going to art school in Florence. Somehow she finds herself lost in the world of Jasmine Jones (Montana Manning), a young fashion designer in Los Angeles who gets by with financial support from her “sugar daddy” Simon Craw (Andrew Pifko), a doctor. After a drunken, sloppy L.A. party, Maya—a young, pink-haired queer woman—finds herself falling in love with Jasmine, completely unaware that she has inadvertently created an awkward triangle with Simon, who turns out to be Maya’s father. Despite these seemingly intriguing twists and turns, the film fails to evoke sympathy for the characters caught in this chaotic circus.
Despite the use of dramatic irony, the film’s impact is limited. As the film progresses and Maya falls deeper and deeper in love with Jasmine, it becomes more difficult and less emotionally urgent to envision how the climax of the film will unfold. The personalities portrayed in the film lack sense and consistency: For example, Jasmine radically shifts at the end from someone who genuinely enjoys spending time with Maya to adopt a “get-out-of-my-face” attitude, in an evolution so extreme that it becomes laughable. Time becomes distorted in the film until the cat is finally out of the bag at the end, evoking an instinctive indifferent and unconcerned reaction rather than a sympathetic one for Maya, who very well deserves it.
Overall, the film lacks a critical sense of credibility. While the film is titled “Daddy Issues,” the plot ends up being about more than just the exploitation of two women by the same “daddy”: Jasmine, for example, must learn to understand her mother’s struggle with bipolar disorder, while Maya worries about her plans for art school. These scenes that splinter off from the main plot have little relevance to the overall story and fail to contribute to the drama taking place in the foreground. While the audience’s full attention should focus on the troubling relationship between Jasmine and Simon, the attention instead shifts to a myriad of different issues. By the end of the film, it feels natural to equate Maya’s wish to go to art school, for example, with the consequential love triangle, relegating the crux of the plot to just another one of the many “issues” the characters must face. This is especially true for the first half of the movie when the plot, setting, and characters take time to develop; by the end of the film, however, it is difficult to establish specifically how these peripheral scenes contribute to the film.
Despite these critical flaws of the film, Nico Aguilar’s cinematography nonetheless adds a narrative authority of its own. While it is hard for the film to demonstrate the confident ethos necessary to draw the audience in, some parts of the film manifest in the imagery itself, which heightens the significance of a given scene. For example, the depiction of Jasmine and Simon’s break-up through the silhouettes on the screen says more than the characters’ lines themselves. Cash’s directorial decision to craft the upsetting mood through visuals, rather than outright dialogue, makes the scene particularly memorable.
The film ultimately ends with an eerie ambiguity about the director’s intentions, making it difficult to answer basic questions about the plot. Is it a comedy or a tragedy? A queer film about loneliness and despair, or a critique of the destructive nature of a rich white man? It is hard to tell when a movie with a simple premise incorporates so many unnecessary extra plot devices, but a single truth stands out: The shallowness of the characters on screen, as well as the director’s shoddy execution of the narrative, combine to make “Daddy Issues” a film about nothing at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 16, 2018 at 10:40 p.m. 
Humor me with a thought exercise—and it’s better if you don’t use Google. You have a problem. A serious problem. Who is the first person at Harvard you might go to? Was your answer your advisor, your program head, or perhaps the Dean of GSAS? Do you know the names of all of these people, and where their offices are if you simply cannot wait for an email reply?
I hope more than 99 percent of graduate students are able to say ”yes” to these questions. Perhaps you may miss the 10 daily emails from the University and haven’t heard of incoming Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench. Maybe, for better or worse, you have not had to interact with the Dean.
Nevertheless, even beyond Dench, Harvard Yard and the nearby Smith Campus Center house dozens of other administrators whose proximity and accessibility leads to both productive engagement with students and a focal point for student protests to have their voices heard. The benefits of this are clear. Students are involved in determining the health insurance plan and Title IX policies, and students’ victory in “pausing” investments of Harvard’s endowment in fossil fuels was only possible with a sit-in. Recent movements in demanding accountability and punishment for sexual assault prominently feature the impact of direct involvement of students and alumni.
Now repeat the exercise in a scenario with a United Auto Workers union. You have a problem. A serious problem. Who at the UAW would you go to? Do you know where their offices are? How expensive would an Uber be to get to their office? While the answer is less obvious, surely there is some staff member at the union you could go to. But what is their title, and where in the organizational hierarchy do they fall? The closest sub-regional office of UAW Region 9A is in Canton, MA—about a 30-minute drive by car or a 3-hour ride on public transportation.
Perhaps your problems need not be addressed in person. If you go to the website of the New York University graduate student union, which is the only example of a union at a private university that successfully negotiated a contract, the “Contact Us” page will redirect you to submit your serious problem to a committee of fellow graduate students. What if you have privacy concerns? Non-intuitively, you have to go to “Stewards and Staff,” under “About Us,” and then scroll past a couple dozen students to finally find UAW staff emails—but no phone number or office location. Meanwhile, on the Harvard GSAS website, the “Contact” page has the information in a simple and intuitive format to find the Office of Student Services.
Of course, the University’s administration is not perfect. There certainly are issues. Speaking from a position of privilege, I do not mean to minimize the experiences of anyone whom the University has failed. But the Harvard administration is at least accessible. With a union, even the simple task of finding who to go first for help is difficult. Imagine working towards a solution to your problem. Sure, there are many bureaucratic complexities and frustrations at Harvard. But with a union, you have to not only familiarize yourself with the “legal-ese” of the grievance process to address your problem (Article 20 of 26 of the NYU contract), but also include a representative from the UAW to act as a third party, in whom you best be confident that they understand your issue and can be a better advocate for you than yourself. Surely it is better to focus time and energy on the solution itself, not the bureaucracy of the union.
Moreover, it’s important to acknowledge that the UAW is an organization open to selling out on its progressive values, with the president of the union saying that he is willing to work with President Donald Trump “anytime.” Additionally, a hefty 28 percent of the union voted for Trump in 2016. Don’t you think there may be enough differences between the UAW constituency and Harvard graduate students that our political interests may be at odds? Is it possible these differences might work against us when deciding policy at the national level? For example, one indicator that the UAW does not prioritize their academic constituents is that only three sentences in 88 pages of their 2016 National Community Action Program booklet mentions graduate student workers.
The union might also further the increasing polarization of our community. Since the start a few years ago of the HGSU-UAW’s organizing campaign, graduate students have become increasingly fractured. Facebook comment sections of union posts quickly become hostile and some students have relayed to me that they have received hate messages from students who are pro-union. At a recent Longwood information session, I witnessed the student arguing against unionization treated with utmost disrespect—he was called a liar, laughed at, and interrupted by pro-union members, until audience members intervened. This may only become worse if a union is elected. For example, at NYU, at least two of the student union stewards mention their opposing positions on Israel/Palestine on the “Stewards and Staff” page. If a union is established, the next crucial step for us will be to elect a group of students to serve on the bargaining committee to negotiate with the University over a contract. It is already hard to imagine how a small group of students can faithfully represent the different interests of students from over 60 different programs. How will these discussions be affected by students who might decide to push their own political agendas over bargaining in the first place?
The union’s campaigning has focused solely on the best-case scenario. That is, we elect a bargaining committee that successfully represents our diverse needs and interests, and the University fairly negotiates a contract without calling our bluff of a strike—which I doubt the vast majority of graduate students would ever participate in. Perhaps we will hopefully get student organizers to address a troubling history in the UAW of corruption and mishandling of sexual misconduct. But there are myriad other reasons we should not vote for a union, and they will not all fit here. Those arguments have already been laid out elsewhere. But I implore students to think critically about what comes next. Already, graduate students have used the unionization effort as a platform to congregate and affect change on our campus. I hope that even if this effort fails, these students will continue in their drive to make Harvard a better place and carry this momentum to mobilize students around the causes they believe in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to students that the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life will merge into one office—called the Dean of Students Office—beginning July 1. With Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 stepping down at the end of the year, the two offices will combine staff under the leadership of current Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
We believe the creation of the DSO is a critical step in the ongoing process of integrating freshmen into upperclassmen life. While there are numerous benefits to keeping freshman life separate from House life with regards to building a cohesive freshman class, there also too often exists a large divide between first-year students and the remainder of the student body. By centralizing all four years of student life and programming, the DSO offers a chance for freshmen to better understand House life and to more frequently interact with upperclassmen than they have in the past.
The move comes as administrators continue efforts to smooth the transition between freshman and upperclassmen campus life, giving rise to increased marketing of events in Houses to freshmen and even the consideration of a switch to a Yale-style housing system in which freshmen would be assigned houses before arriving on campus.
Nevertheless, the DSO should continue to give special attention to the freshman experience, which poses unique challenges. Given that Houses already provide significant administrative and social support to upperclassmen, the only students who stand to lose in this transition are freshmen. Thus, their needs and concerns should be especially considered as the offices merge.
Since 2004, Dingman and the FDO have demonstrated that first-year students require unique programming, and have done so with actions such as carefully selecting diverse freshman entryways, offering First-Year Experience workshops, and coordinating dinners and other social events. At a time when use of mental health services among college freshmen across the country is on the rise, this focus is critical in making sure that freshmen have the personal support and social outlets needed to combat the stress and loneliness that are unfortunately part of any first year experience.
That said, our appreciation for the positive changes Dingman has brought to campus as both an administrative coordinator and a friendly face in Harvard Yard primes us to worry about him having no successor. We hope that the administration’s decision to dedicate an administrator specifically to first-year residential life will help alleviate this loss, and we encourage that person to look closely to Dingman’s legacy as a model for their work and campus presence.
Crafting a shared Harvard College identity is important work—work a united DSO will do better than the separated OSL and FDO. As long as the DSO continues the important work of the FDO under Dingman, we wholeheartedly support the creation of this new office and urge further efforts toward the betterment of Harvard’s undergraduate campus life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1453, someone forgot to lock Constantinople’s Kerkoporta Gate, enabling the Ottoman army to sack the city. In late 1862, a Union corporal discovered General Harvey Hill’s battleplans in a discarded cigar box, allowing the Union Army to halt the Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam. Although I neither smoke nor worry about Ottoman sieges, these mistakes unnerve me.
Like most amateur historians, I often spend my evenings scrolling through Wikipedia as my mind toys with counterfactual history. For me, our past is more than what happened—it’s also a matter of what could have happened. Omissions, oversights, and lapses in judgment; these are the plagues that comprise our history and render our imaginations vulnerable to an abyss of alternative worlds. What if someone had locked the Kerkoporta Gate? What if Hill had done a better job safeguarding his sensitive military documents? What would our world look like today?
As you can imagine, this kind of thinking leads me to dread any sort of introspection or self-reflection. The more time I spend studying my past, the more cataclysmic my mistakes become. In turn, each of these mistakes evolves into a distinct storyline, an alternate “Nathan” who torments my mind with his moral, intellectual, and social superiority.
Unfortunately, these imaginary “Nathans” are not confined to my mind; they manifest themselves in my friends, acquaintances, and coworkers. Each of my peers presents another counterfactual, a living monument to my shortcomings. In athletes I see a stronger, more disciplined version of myself capable of balancing school with his desire for fitness. In programmers I see a Nathan who dedicated himself to studying something more economically promising. In my fellow cadets I see another Nathan: a Nathan who focused on his military studies, a Nathan better prepared to lead future soldiers.
Some people may deem such toxic thinking to be that of an insecure, jealous soul. However, I find the term “personal disaffection” more fitting. I understand that life isn’t a zero-sum game of accomplishments and accolades. Thus, I don’t feel threatened when my peers perform well. Instead, I find comfort in knowing that humanity has one more dependable asset to help defeat tomorrow’s crises. What bothers me aren’t the achievements of others, but rather my perceived inability to live up to my alleged potential. Consequently, each passing day devolves into another “could have been” or “should have done,” leaving me locked in a state of perpetual disappointment.
Salvation from my personal purgatory of counterfactuals arrived unexpectedly. My friends and family regularly send me articles to read, but unbeknownst to them, their articles usually end up lost among my computer’s legions of bookmarked web pages. Nevertheless, as last semester came to a close, I finally decided to conquer these bookmarks and, in doing so, came across a fascinating article regarding infidelity. What made the article particularly memorable wasn’t its subject or message (though I found both entertaining). Instead, what stuck with me most was the following quote, by the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman: “[T]here is always a suspicion … that one is living a lie or a mistake, that something crucially important has been overlooked, missed, neglected, left untried and unexplored ...”
And there it was, the perfect description of my incessant anxiety, the myth of the better me, the better you, the better anyone. Whether we like it or not, there’s only one version of any of us: the present one. By comparing ourselves to our imagined fantasies, we only risk crushing our actual selves with worthless counterfactuals.
History is full of mistakes. Almost six hundred years ago, someone forgot to lock a door. One hundred and fifty-six years ago a Union scavenger and a careless secessionist helped destroy the Confederacy. Two years ago I foolishly kicked a frozen snowman, bruising two of my toes in the process. These mistakes comprise our timeline, the only timeline that matters, the only timeline that’s real. This is not to diminish the value of self-reflection; acknowledging and analyzing our past is the only way we can learn anything about ourselves. Instead, this piece serves as a warning to those who confuse reflection with self-castigation. Simply put, you cannot compare yourself with something that doesn’t exist.
So stop dreaming of counterfactual timelines. Stop coveting a better past. Stop searching for your failings in the achievements of others. Instead, strive to improve your present self, not for the sake of meeting a fictional standard, but to better serve your future.

“Uno siempre anhela tener una sala bonita con un comedor bonito y, pues, no. Tampoco se arriesga uno a comprar una sala bonita porque de pronto hoy estamos aquí y mañana no.”
And so my mom recounts her feelings to me one day, of not being able to fully settle in our home. She has not been able to buy the furniture she desires for so long because our future is uncertain. New furniture is an investment we can’t risk.
“No puede uno vivir, en ese sentido, tranquilo porque no sabe que va a pasar mañana.”
My family still resides in the same apartment we moved into when we first came to the United States. We’ve been here for over 16 years now. But we have to take it as it comes. I see my parents’ gratitude in what we have. We’ve been able to have a relatively peaceful experience, taking it day by day, week by week, year by year.
I remember conversations of other housing options we could have. I remember talk of moving to another state or looking for an apartment with more space. But the conversations never developed into anything bigger. We take it as it comes.
“En ese sentido uno también se sacrifica. Pero eso lo escogimos.”
My mom sees all this as a sacrifice she made for her children. My parents immigrated in search of a better future, not necessarily for them, but for their children. They have been stuck in place, following their routines for years so my siblings and I could move forward. We can dream because of them. But we still face so much uncertainty ourselves.
My parents had goals for us to get an education, even if they couldn’t. But because of my immigration status, I never saw college as much of an option until I saw how well I was doing in school. I inherited my parents’ goals and plans for my future, which drove me forward and kept me motivated throughout high school.
While my goals continue to drive me at Harvard, they also scare me. The uncertainty of the future scares me. I felt this uncertainty more strongly after the presidential election. Only months into my freshman year of college, I didn’t know what to expect. My future felt out of my control.
More uncertainty was added when the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was announced. As one of the lucky recipients, I had begun to find comfort in some sense of stability it gave. Even if it wasn’t a path to citizenship, I thought I at least had the option to work after college. I had heard stories of a family member who had to go back to Colombia after graduating because his degree did him no good without a work permit.
I couldn’t really set my mind to a goal without thinking about the things that could get in the way of it. Life planning takes another level when you’re undocumented; there are things you have to take into account when trying to figure out and plan for your future. It’s not just about what you want to do, but also about what options are open to you.
I am beginning to think about what my next few years could look like. This summer, I plan to do research in cities on the U.S.’s southern border. I originally had a different plan, but had to change it because my DACA expires before next summer. I’m not sure if I’d be able to have the same protection going through possible border checkpoints then. With the expiration of my DACA, I may also end up losing my job in the admissions office.
As I look into post-college options, I see graduate school as an option right out of Harvard because I’m still not sure if I will be able to work. I have talked to other undocumented students in graduate school to try to get some guidance for this process I’d like to undertake. But a five-year program still sounds like more than I can comfortably sign myself up for.
With all the hardships that can come with the end of DACA, it is also important to acknowledge that most of the undocumented community is already experiencing this. People who didn’t qualify for DACA do not fear losing the privileges of working and protection from deportation because they never had access to them to begin with. They have lived in constant limbo.
When I talked to my mom that day, I was reminded of all this uncertainty. We have yet to be granted a permanent spot in the country we have lived in for 16 years. We are still just guests—living out of a suitcase, careful not to pick up too many souvenirs from a country that could decide we have overstayed our welcome at any point.
We keep taking it as it comes, hoping that one day we’ll find enough assurance to buy the nice furniture my mom has always wanted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 16, 2018 at 6:18 a.m
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern called video footage of at least one Cambridge Police Department officer repeatedly punching a black Harvard undergraduate Friday before law enforcement arrested the student “disturbing” in a statement Sunday.
McGovern's statement comes less than two days after a physical confrontation between a College student and four law enforcement officials—including three CPD officers and one Transit Police Department officer—that led to the student's arrest.
The police approached the student, who was standing naked on a traffic island in the middle of Mass. Ave., around 9:09 p.m. Friday. After learning from acquaintances the student had previously taken narcotics, the officers engaged the student in a physical altercation.
CPD previously tweeted out an account of the interaction that states the student clenched "both of his fist and started taking steps towards" the police, prompting officers involved to "grab his legs and bring him to the ground." Eyewitnesses of the event—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated CPD's version of events is "incorrect" and have called the incident an instance of police brutality.
"A naked, unarmed Black man stood still on the median at the center of Massachusetts Avenue," a statement later released by BLSA reads. "He was surrounded by at least four Cambridge Police Department (CPD) officers who, without provocation, lunged at him, tackled him and pinned him to the ground."
"While on the ground, at least one officer repeatedly punched the student in his torso as he screamed for help," the statement continues.
A CPD police report detailing the arrest states one officer involved in the incident punched the student at least five times while the student remained on the ground.
Unable to pry the student's "hands from underneath his body, I delivered approximately 5 strikes with closed fists to the area of his stomach," the police report reads. "These seemed ineffective."
The student was ultimately charged on several accounts including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault.
Some bystanders filmed the event, and at least one version of the video circulating on Twitter depicts some of the punches the CPD officer delivered to the student's stomach. The mayor's statement Sunday seems to respond to some version of video footage of the event.
"What is shown on the video is disturbing," McGovern wrote in the statement. "We have high standards for our police officers in Cambridge."
"When confrontations cannot be averted and include the use of physical force, we must be willing to review our actions to ensure that our police officers are providing the highest level of safety for all," he wrote.
McGovern wrote he called the Cambridge City Manager after hearing of the student's arrest. He wrote he is following the situation "closely" and that he has had several discussions with the City Manager and the Commissioner across the weekend. He also noted his colleagues on the Cambridge City Council are in communication with "student organizers and community activists;" following the incident Friday, hundreds of Harvard affiliates banded together across campus to meet, reflect, and craft a response going forward.
McGovern also wrote he is in communication with Police Commissioner Branville Bard, who assured him CPD will investigate the Friday night incident. CPD policy mandates an interval review whenever officers use force.
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale also issued a statement over the weekend, in part writing he has “great faith” in Bard and other officials' ability to conduct this internal review.
McGovern appeared to indicate some of the review's results may become public in his statement Sunday, writing that he and his colleagues will follow the review "closely to ensure that all the facts are properly investigated and that the public is informed of any and all developments."
In his statement, McGovern also reaffirmed that Cambridge supports the Black Lives Matter movement. In his inaugural address in January, McGovern pledged to fight “racism, sexism, and hatred.”
“Cambridge affirms that Black Lives Matter, but it must be true in practice as well,” McGovern wrote in the statement Sunday. “As Mayor, I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure that the horrific treatment of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement has no place in Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from Harvard and Princeton are partnering with Twitter to conduct a study that aims to test strategies for reducing online bullying and abuse.
Susan Benesch, a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, and J. Nathan Matias, a postdoctoral associate at Princeton’s Psychology department, are currently running their experiment on Twitter.  In their study, some number of randomly chosen Twitter users see one of the several modified user experiences designed to curb online abuse.
“We approached more than one platform, and Twitter agreed to do it,” Benesch said.
Citing the need to preserve the integrity of their results, Benesch declined to specify exactly what measures will be tested in the study. In a Medium post, however, Benesch and Matias pointed to previous research showing that, when institutions publish rules clearly, people are more likely to follow the guidelines. Benesch and Matias wrote they plan to examine this hypothesis, along with other methods to prevent abuse, in their study.
“The study will continue through the spring, and we plan to publish findings by the end of the year, if not sooner,” Benesch wrote in an email.
Both Benesch and Matias have previously studied issues related to negative online interactions. In 2016, Matias authored a paper on reddit moderator behavior, and in 2010, Benesch started the Dangerous Speech Project, which collaborates with the Berkman Klein Center.
The Dangerous Speech Project is one of Twitter’s Trust and Safety Partners.  According to a Twitter spokesperson, Benesch said they wanted to study behavior change on Twitter and reached out to coordinate the study on behalf of the DSP.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2018 at 2:30 a.m.
Biblical scholar and queer rights activist Matthew R. Vines argued for a BGLTQ-accepting reading of the Bible to a crowd of around 50 undergraduate and graduate students Saturday.
The event—which comes roughly two months after the College’s decision to put Christian student group Harvard College Faith and Action on probation after members demoted a bisexual leader in the organization—was jointly organized by Queer Rights, a Harvard Divinity School student group, the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and Faith in Differences, a group for religious BGLTQ undergraduates, according to an organizer.
During the course of his talk, Vines—who left the College during his sophomore year in 2010—talked about his personal experiences advocating for the rights of BGLTQ Christians to his family in Kansas, within his church, and as a member of conservative Christian student groups at Harvard.
“Despite some of the tensions and challenges that I had with those groups, it really was the best community that I found in my first year here,” Vines said. “I actually felt like I was able to get to know people and be seen and not be completely invisible.”
Vines discussed six Bible verses that some religious leaders assert condemn homosexuality; he reinterpreted the verses through the lenses of more “affirming” readings that place the lines in cultural and temporal contexts. Vines also argued that long-term, monogamous homosexual relationships were not a well-known cultural phenomenon until recently, and that, therefore, no Bible verse responds directly to these relationships.
Vines also responded point by point to arguments made by Jackie Hill-Perry, an “ex-gay” speaker and an outspoken critic of homosexuality, at a talk she gave at an HCFA meeting in February, shortly before College administrators placed the group on probation. Vines cited the controversy surrounding Hill-Perry’s visit—which drew protest from some students and faculty—as one of his motivations for coming to speak at the University.
“This type of message has done unfathomable harm and destruction to LGBTQ people around the world—broken so many relationships, broken so many lives,” Vines said.
Aidan L. Stoddart ‘21, who helped organize the event, said Vines’s focus on a close reading of scripture “creates a bridge” between Christians with varying ideologies.
“I think Matthew's a really important figure because he has a critical, and mature, and very deeply life-giving relationship with scripture that is centered on love,” Stoddart said. “Because it’s based on a love of scripture that we all share.”
Hanna McCuistion ‘20, who attended the event, said she comes from an “affirming” background, but had never thought much about the relationship between her Christianity and her support for gay marriage.
“It’s really great for me to hear from a position of a scriptural perspective, how I can use the scripture to show others that kind of love and potentially engage in more intellectual and scriptural conversations,” McCuistion said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2018 at 2:30 a.m.
A line of customers stretched out the door of Pokeworks on Saturday for the Irvine, Calif.-based chain’s “grand opening” in Harvard Square.
Pokeworks serves its namesake Hawaiian dish in a rice bowl, burrito, or salad with either chicken, tofu, or one of five types of seafood. Its Harvard Square location opened in mid-March at 1440 Massachusetts Ave, amid a snowstorm.
Saturday’s celebration, which comes about one month after the restaurant first opened its doors, served as an official welcoming from Pokeworks, and the fast food restaurant offered a buy one, get one free deal for any of its main dishes.
On the unusually cold April day, employees at the chain said they were pleasantly surprised by the large turnout for the special deal. At about 6 p.m., the line for poke extended well past the storefront. According to Pokeworks employee Ernest Lyles, this led to a complaint from nearby Otto’s Pizzeria that the foot traffic was blocking the entrance to their restaurant.
“It was actually all the way down to Bank of America,” Lyles said.
When the line later relocated to Church Street, wrapping the opposite direction around the Pokeworks storefront, it reached past the now-vacant Harvard Square Theatre.
Lyles said the fast-food chain also offered free miso soup samples to waiting customers to thank them for braving the cold as they waited—some for more than 30 minutes—for a taste of discounted poke.
Jaehyun “James” Lee ’21, a self-proclaimed poke enthusiast from San Diego, Calif., said he is pleased one of his favorite dishes has finally come to the Square.
“I’m a big fan of poke,” Lee said after waiting in line for around 20 minutes. “I’m pretty excited.”
“He dragged me out of Adams to come here,” Rachel D. Levy ’21 added. “High expectations.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 17, 2018
 A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Pokeworks is an Oakland, Calif.-based company. In fact, Pokeworks is based out of Irvine, Calif.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis said Sunday that Harvard’s Office of General Counsel and Massachusetts Hall—traditionally a name for the University’s central administration—are “involved” in examining the Friday arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate.
Davis—who gave this update at a weekly meeting of the Undergraduate Council—said he is unsure whether or not “decisions have been made” with regard “to any kind of a formal investigation” of the incident. OGC comprises Harvard’s internal arm of lawyers who help legally represent the University.
“I do know that the Office of the General Counsel is involved, I do know that Mass. Hall is involved,” Davis said Sunday. “So I would imagine that some sort of investigative process is forthcoming, if it hasn’t already been initiated.”
University spokespeople could not immediately be reached for comment late Sunday evening.
Cambridge Police Department officers arrested the Harvard undergraduate Friday evening after the student and law enforcement engaged in a physical altercation. In the account of events CPD later published on social media, officers wrote the student—who was naked and who CPD determined had previously taken narcotics—clenched “both of his fists and started taking steps towards” the police, prompting officers involved to “grab his legs and bring him to the ground.”
But eyewitnesses of the event—including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association—have stated CPD’s version of events is “incorrect” and have called the incident an instance of police brutality.
“A naked, unarmed Black man stood still on the median at the center of Massachusetts Avenue,” a statement later released by BLSA reads. “He was surrounded by at least four Cambridge Police Department (CPD) officers who, without provocation, lunged at him, tackled him and pinned him to the ground.”
“While on the ground, at least one officer repeatedly punched the student in his torso as he screamed for help,” the BLSA statement reads.
The CPD police report detailing the arrest states one officer involved in the incident punched the student at least five times while the student remained on the ground in an attempt to unpin his arms and handcuff the undergraduate. The student was ultimately charged on several counts including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault.
BLSA’s statement argues other Harvard resources—not CPD—should have been contacted and mobilized to come to the student’s aid before CPD got involved. In particular, the statement states Harvard University Health Services were contacted first, but that HUHS transferred the callers to CPD.
UC representatives questioned Davis Sunday as to why HUHS transferred the callers to CPD, with at least one student calling the decision “concerning.”
“And you should be concerned about that,” Davis said in reply. “There are a lot of questions that need to be answered. How CPD even became involved in this situation is the biggest one and I don’t have an answer to that right now.”
“I’ve been trying to get an answer to that and I don’t have an answer to that right now, so read between the lines,” he said.
Davis encouraged UC members to put pressure on Harvard’s administration to demand an answer to that question. He told representatives they should “keep that a present and burning issue” before administrators.
“I think you, as the governing body of the undergraduate student population, you can ask those questions,” Davis said.  “You may get answers in a way that I can’t.”
Quincy House Representative Sarah Fellman ’18 asked Davis whether there will be a meeting between students and representatives from HUHS and CPD. Davis said he does not yet know the “specifics” surrounding a potential meeting, but noted that administrators including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair have been “in meetings all day” to discuss the issue.
Davis noted he himself will be in a meeting at 8 a.m. Monday morning “where I think some of that information will be conveyed.”
“When we know, then we’ll let people know,” he said.
Ivy Yard Representative Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21 also questioned Davis about the College’s amnesty policy and how “it kind of fell apart” during the Friday incident.
The amnesty policy states that, if a Harvard undergraduate brings “an intoxicated or drug-impaired friend” to HUHS or to another hospital—or to seek help from College residential staffers or HUPD—neither the student nor the friend “will face disciplinary action from the College for having used or provided alcohol or drugs.”
“I hope to hell it’s being looked at,” Davis said when asked why the amnesty policy was not applied during the Friday incident involving the student.
“I think what you all need answers to is why the system didn’t work the way you thought it should work,” Davis said at another point.  “And I think you’re entitled to those answers.”
Some UC members described their plans to mobilize in the wake of the arrest at the Sunday meeting. Student Relations Committee chair Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 called College students’ efforts to organize to date “quite extensive.”
“Salma [Abdelrahman ’19] and I and a junior at the College, Hilda Jordan [’19], are organizing some kind of body that’s trying to be a response and advocacy kind of body,” Whittaker said.
Whittaker said he and others involved with this organizing effort are currently “fundamentally focused” on helping and protecting the student involved in the arrest. In the days following the Friday incident, hundreds of Harvard affiliates gathered in meetings across campus to discuss the arrest, share concerns, and plan a response.
“The next steps are engaging in the larger conversation about how the University handles things like this and when it eventually get there, the national conversation,” Whittaker said.  “We’re trying to mobilize as quickly as possible.”
Abdelrahman detailed steps she hopes the UC will take in response to the incident. She said she thinks the Council should issue a “statement of support and solidarity with black students” at Harvard and also with the arrested student. Abdelrahman also said the UC should hold a public meeting with the heads of HUHS and HUPD.
“I think these are all important measures, considering that we are the representatives of the student body,” Abdelrahman.  “I also think that holding some of the administrative bodies accountable that were involved in this specific incident—so UHS, HUPD.”
Dunster House Representative Victor Agbafe ’19 asked Davis whether administrators are holding discussions with CPD and HUPD in the wake of the arrest about what constitutes “correct protocol” during an “escalating situation” like Friday’s incident.
“Dean Khurana pledged to get people in the room to have some of these conversations,” Davis responded.  “I think one of the things that will need to come from that is a way to make sure that students understand what the policies are, what your rights are, and what you can expect in terms of your interactions with both HUPD and CPD.”
In an interview before the meeting, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 promised to use her platform to “support students unequivocally.”
Zhang said she and Council Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 want to work with HUPD, CPD, HUHS, administrators, and different “affected communities” going forward.
“Something went terribly wrong that night,” she said.  “And there’s something that needs to be changed in understanding the ecosystem of how different things interacted, [which] will help us understand where we can put UC efforts to change it.”
Asked Sunday whether Harvard as an entity can take a “stance” on the student’s arrest, Davis said he was unsure.
“It would be stupid of me to speak for Harvard University,” he said. “I like my job. So I don’t know.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students filled Tercentenary Theatre Friday evening to watch Wale and Lil Yachty perform at Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoor spring concert.
As the sunlight faded, the headliners took the stage. Confetti spurted from the front of the platform as Wale began his performance. The rap singer performed tracks including “The Matrimony” and “Lotus Flower Bomb,” among his other works.
“All you future millionaires, put your hands up!” Wale called to the audience.
Several students who attended Yardfest said they enjoyed the headliners’ performance.
“It was a fun time,” Case McKinley ’21 said. McKinley said he was “not much into rap,” but appreciated the need to offer students a wide variety of music. For the past two years, electronic dance music artists have headlined Yardfest.
Near the end of the concert, the performers called for the mosh pits to be opened, and praised one side of the crowd for its superior dancing.
“We not even talking about school right now. We’re gonna turn the fuck up,” Lil Yachty told the crowd before performing his song “Forever Young.”
“All the pretty ladies, DM me,” Lil Yachty said before leaving the stage around 9:05 p.m., when students began to disperse from Tercentenary Theatre.
The College Events Board, which organizes Yardfest, declined to comment for this story.
In a press release last month, co-chair Jackson M. Grigsby ’20 wrote the “committee has worked extremely hard in the last few weeks and months in preparation for the event, and we expect the concert to be fantastic.”
Yardfest also featured two student opening acts. Student group Disco Band opened the concert, performing “Signed, Sealed Delivered,” “Dancing Queen,”  and other disco hits as students munched on burgers and devoured ice cream cones.
Before drifting to Tercentenary Theatre for Yardfest, many students attended neighborhood block parties hosted by the upperclassmen House Committees. The block parties featured bouncy castles, free shirts, and free alcoholic drinks for students over 21.
21 Colorful Crimson, another student group selected as an opening act, followed Disco Band. 21 CC, which comprises 21 Harvard freshmen, named “creativity, inclusion, and love” as its three pillars in an interview ahead of the concert.
The two groups won the “Battle for Yardfest” in Sanders Theatre last month, during which 10 student groups competed to perform at Yardfest. The College Events Board wrote in a preview of Disco Band that they are a 13-person group dedicated to performing music from the 1970s.
“It was really good,” said Max V. Filipchenko ’20. “Disco Band was amazing.”
“They were very interesting, maybe not what we expected, given the performers who were invited,” said Anne E. Carlstein ’20. Other students declined to comment on the opening acts, citing their own drunkenness.
Sporting bro tanks and dancing, students assembled in a tightly packed crowd in front of Memorial Church and bounced a pair of large inflatable beach balls.
“I nearly died a while ago,” Daniel Um ’19 said of the packed crowd.

Members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee held talks, panels, and film screenings throughout last week to raise awareness regarding Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as part of Israeli Apartheid Week.
PSC Co-Vice President Christian B. Tabash ’21 said the week—a national movement among college campuses in the United States—seeks to draw attention to the current state of the Palestinian people. Tabash particularly emphasized the event was meant to highlight what he called the discrimination toward and oppression ofPalestinians.
Harvard’s Israeli Apartheid Week focused on intersectionality, according to Tabash. Events included a panel discussion with the Harvard Black Students Association, a social art event that forms part of an ongoing project about sexual harassment and assault, and a screening of a documentary about Palestinian journalists fighting to maintain a free press.
In addition, a wall stood in the Science Center Plaza through Thursday to draw to attention to the Palestinian cause, as well as to other human rights issues across the world.
The week began with an introductory event that reviewed the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Speakers cited Israel’s 1948 expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and said the conflict is largely territorial, not religious.
Speakers also said Palestinians are forced to carry identification at all times, subjected to “discriminatory” laws, and that Palestinians face high imprisonment rates.
On Tuesday, the PSC and the Black Students Association co-hosted an event entitled “Black Palestinian Solidarity.” Divinity School and African and African American Studies professor and renowned social activist Cornel R. West ’74 spoke about the treatment of Palestinians.
“I concluded a long time ago that the Israeli occupation is not just illegal and immoral, but it’s evil. And like Apartheid it’s a crime against humanity, and it needs to be said clearly,” West said.
Carl Williams, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who spoke on the same panel, argued the struggle for freedom links all subjugated peoples across the world.
“We can be free, we will be free, and it’s never going to happen if just Palestinian people are free, and it’s never going to happen if just black people are free,” Williams said, “Because it really is one struggle.”
On Wednesday, the PSC hosted the “Not Your Habibti” Project, an ongoing socially engaged art project founded by Palestinian-American Yasmeen Mjalli.
For the last six months, Mjalli has collected stories from Arabic women in Palestine and Italy about their experiences with street harassment and other forms of sexual harassment and sexual assault.
Mjalli compiled the anonymous stories together into one physical exhibition. The project is motivated by two central goals, according to Mjalli: to make a statement by breaking the taboo of sharing stories of sexual harassment and to help women heal from these traumas.
In particular, Mjalli said she wants to encourage women to speak up to help themselves move forward.
Mjalli’s stop at Harvard for Israeli Apartheid Week forms part of her U.S. tour, which she said she now hopes will shed light on how Greek life and campus assault uniquely impact young women in the United States.
During the session, each of the Harvard women who attended the event shared a story.
“If you took a pile of these letters from both Italy and Palestine and I asked you to pin them up on a map, you wouldn’t be able to,” Mjalli said. “These stories [of sexual harassment and assault] are totally universal.”
“It wasn’t until I got to the U.S. that some of the letters were distinct,” Mjalli said.
Students also hosted a talk led by two Palestinian women living in the West Bank, as well as two movie screenings. Thursday’s film screening featured the movie “Five Broken Cameras,” which included recovered footage from five of Palestinian Emad Brunat’s cameras broken by the Israeli Defense Forces while Brunat was documenting life and struggles in Palestine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Joan Braverman Pinck ’50 first came to Radcliffe, she was recovering from a dormitory fire at her high school that left her with burns so severe she needed assistance buttoning her shirt, tying her shoes, and cutting her food.
That was a formative moment in developing Pinck's character, her daughter Alex E. Pinck said.
“Having to ask for help made my mother fiercely independent and strong-willed,” she said.
Pinck, an advocate for women’s rights, was one of the first female administrators at the Business School, holding positions as an assistant dean and lecturer. She died March 10 at 89.
Ellen Hume ’68, who was a student of Pinck’s at the Dana Hall high school in Wellesley, Mass., said Pinck’s facial scars from the fire were intimidating, but much less so than her high standards as an English teacher.
“Her sonorous voice lifted up phrases like ‘This distracted globe’ and she decoded what it meant for us—not just this crazy world, but the confusion raging in poor Hamlet’s own head,” Hume wrote in an email. “Teaching us to see beneath the surface… was one of her important legacies.”
High school teaching was one of Pinck’s first jobs after graduating Radcliffe—an unusual move at a time when many women married during or immediately after college and became full-time homemakers. It was the start of a career steeped in education.
“She was first and foremost a teacher,” Charles Pinck, Pinck’s son, said.
Pinck would go on to a varied career—holding jobs ranging from the director of Research Administration and Policy at Beth Israel, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital, to assistant secretary of education to Governor Michael Dukakis to her time at the Business School.
Regardless of the positions she held, Pinck remained a passionate advocate for women’s rights. In a 1976 seminar for women in banking, titled “Equal Opportunity: Profit Opportunity,” Pinck recounted a prospective employer telling her that, given she had two children and would not promise to “sin no more, there was no job.” She said she was told she was overqualified so often she could “barely use the term without shuddering.”
And in another speech in 1975, she spoke of how the “acculturation process” for women teaches them not just “everything they don’t have to know” but “things which, when practiced, are virtually guaranteed to hold them back,” and how opportunities for women in academia “lagged shamefully but not even shamefacedly behind” other industries.
Pinck combatted these forces throughout her career. As the dean of students at Pine Manor College from 1969 to 1972, Pinck helped institute one of the early Open College programs, groundbreaking given its particular focus on enabling women who did not complete college to re-enroll and finish their degrees.
Alex Pinck said her mother was a powerful force in her many administrative and consultant positions, whether pushing for opportunities for women as a part of the Board of Directors of the Harvard Community Health Plan, now known as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, or working with Catholic charities and combating sexual assault within the Catholic church as a Jewish woman.
“It was a man’s world back then, and my mother was proud to be at the table with them,” Alex Pinck said.
At the Business School, Pinck taught writing in the "Written Analysis of Cases" course, a required report writing course for Business School students at the time. Charles Pinck recalled many former students saying it was the most valuable course they had taken.
Pinck carried her formidable teaching skills beyond the Business School to her time at Beth Israel, Pinck’s former research assistant Michael Lanner said.
Lanner remembered Pinck as a no-nonsense and cigar-smoking woman who used her experience in academia to overcome a lack of knowledge of science and technology in her position as director of research administration and policy at Beth Israel Hospital.
Pinck used her business skills to negotiate patents and licenses with drug companies and was one of the first leaders to develop policies related to her position. She opened up “a new era of business at B.I.,” Lanner said.
Lanner ultimately assumed Pinck’s position when she left.
“I really owe my entire career to her,” he said, adding he credits her with teaching him how to write.
“Even today, when I write something, I always think of her,” he said.
Jennifer Pinck, Pinck’s daughter, said her mother’s determination and grit served as one of the most visible traits she passed on to her children—as well as a confidence for breaking barriers, given Jennifer Pinck was the first woman to obtain a Boston ABC license to perform any type of construction work in the City.
“I think I got the chutzpah from my mother because she did it,” Jennifer Pinck said. “That spirit and the confidence.”
Jennifer Pinck said that, even in later years when she was ill, her mother retained her independent spirit.
“You don’t tell my mother, ‘You can’t do it,’” Alex Pinck said. “Even until she passed, you don’t tell my mother she couldn’t do something. She dug her heels in.”
Ultimately, Pinck’s three children agreed Radcliffe formed the center of their mother’s identity and pride. As a student, Pinck was student government president. Alex Pinck recalled stories of her mother driving her friends around in her car, or eating her friends’ leftover chocolate ice cream.
Pinck enthusiastically participated in alumni events, with gear from commencements past in abundance around the house. She loved the opera and loved to travel, particularly to countries in Africa. She enjoyed wearing colorful Marimekko prints, and one of her favorite pastimes was reading from her beloved book of Chaucer with markings from her years at Radcliffe.
“She was a barrier breaker,” Alex Pinck said. “When it wasn’t the thing to do and it wasn’t the time.”
Pinck is survived by her husband Dan, and four children, Charles, Anthony, Jennifer, and Alexandra.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Allston and Brighton homeowners and renters joined a grassroots coalition over the past week to encourage Harvard and other local institutions to increase their commitment to affordable housing, green spaces, and public transportation in the area.
Allstonian Kevin M. Carragee, one of the 11 founding members, sent an email two weeks ago announcing the formation of the Brighton Allston Community Coalition to an online Allston-Brighton forum last week.  In the email, Carragee urged residents interested in joining to contact the group.
The creation of BACC comes amid recent tensions in the Allston and Brighton area over the housing market, green space, and public transit. In past months, Allston and Brighton residents protested anticipated traffic congestion issues due to construction delays on West Station.  Local businesses and residents have also filed public comment letters in response to Harvard’s plans for Allston, commenting on the lack of designated green space and asking for a new housing plan that ensures “economic, racial, and family structure diversity.”
In a March letter responding to these concerns, University officials wrote that current plans for residential spaces will evolve as Harvard works with future development partners.
Part of BACC’s mission statement, according to Carragee’s email, is to ask Harvard and other local universities like Boston University and Boston College to make a “binding” commitment to housing its students on campus.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement Sunday that Harvard houses nearly all undergraduates on its campus—and that Harvard has the capacity to house nearly half of its graduate students.
“The University also supports a wide range of programs and initiatives actively working to increase and create more diverse and affordable housing options across both Boston and Cambridge,” O’Rourke wrote.
In an interview, Carragee said he gives credit to Harvard for housing its undergraduates on campus. Roughly 97 percent of undergraduates choose to live in the College’s on-campus housing. Carragee noted, however, that Harvard does not have similar policies for its graduate students, some of which live in Allston-Brighton.
“Harvard could make a contribution, an important contribution, by housing some of their graduate students,” Carragee said. “Universities can help remedy the housing crisis—they can’t solve it on their own, I recognize that—but they can relieve the housing crisis.”
Carragee compared Harvard with other local universities that do not house all of their undergraduates on campus. He said undergraduates from those universities live in “a sizeable number” of residential housing units.
“That is an ill use of residential housing stock, driving up rent and driving up home prices,” Carragee said. “Landlords can charge four undergraduates very high rents and rents that are far higher than a family can afford.”
Local residents, like Eva Webster, wrote in email responses to the announcement that they were “in a celebratory mood.”
“I believe that in view of what is happening on the development front, and our elected officials’ apparent inability to slow things down or reduce the excessive scale of certain projects, Allston-Brighton needs as much strong civic engagement as we can possibly muster,” Webster wrote.
Brighton resident Margarita Montero also praised the formation of the coalition, writing that locals “have more political power if we worked together.”
Carragee said the group also aims to “bridge differences” between older residents and younger residents, as well as residents of different racial and ethnic communities.
“We aim to build a coalition—we intentionally use that word in our name,” Carragee said. “The Allston-Brighton community is diverse, and the coalition should reflect that diversity.”
Harvard a few years ago designated $3 million of its community benefits package to support the All Bright Homeownership Program an initiative to buy up homes in the area and resell them to homeowners with an owner-occupancy deed restriction, which stipulates the buyer must live on the property.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 75 students gathered Saturday to discuss the campus reverberations of the ongoing lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process.
Sally Chen ’19, co-director of the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies—the group that organized the event in the Science Center—said the meeting was meant to inform attendees about the lawsuit and to address questions and tensions among undergraduates.
“We were hoping to address these concerns in the Asian-American community about what is going on in holistic admissions, how is this different from discrimination, and wanted to bring these issues out in a space where people could talk about it without feeling like necessarily there was all tension,” she said.
The lawsuit—which the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions filed against Harvard in 2014—will likely come to trial in mid-October. The Department of Justice is also conducting a separate probe into Harvard's admissions practices.
Both the Students for Fair Admissions litigants and the Justice Department have formally requested Harvard release thousands of pages of admissions documents, and a federal judge in Boston ruled last week that Harvard must file certain previously confidential admissions records with the court—one set under seal and one redacted set accessible to the public.
The event Saturday consisted of panel and small-group discussions, followed by a question-and-answer session held between the audience and panel members.
Panelists included Graduate School of Education Professor Natasha K. Warikoo, NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyer Michaele N. Turnage Young, and Matt Cregor, a member of the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice who is working with a multiracial group of students to oppose the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit.
Cregor opened the discussion with a brief overview of the lawsuit, critiquing Students for Fair Admissions President Edward Blum, who is leading the legal campaign against Harvard’s admissions practices.
“Mr. Blum is effectively leveraging what is a meaningful concern on behalf of Asian Americans in the way they are treated compared to white students that are applying in order to eliminate any use of race conscious admissions to support underrepresented racial minorities,” Cregor said.
Warikoo emphasized this point, highlighting what she called the irony that laws meant to protect minorities are now being used against these groups.
“I don't know if people see the irony behind these laws that are designed to protect racial minorities that are now being used as an argument against protection for racial minorities,” she said.
Panelists discussed the definition of merit and what they called a perception that minorities must compete against each other in the admissions process.
“I think what we tend to do is sort of say that… these fixed seats for whites are constant and then Asians and blacks and Latinos are fighting for the crumbs at the ends,” Warikoo said.
Several College affinity groups, including the Black Students Association, Chinese Students Association, Fuerza Latina and South Asian Association, co-sponsored the event. Many of the attendees were Asian-American College students.
“We did aim the content of the event at Asian-Americans, but I think we… really were looking to get a more diverse range of the student body,” said Daniel Lu ’20, the programming director for TAPAS.
“The lawsuit might be framed as an Asian-American issue, but obviously race-conscious admissions is a topic of interest for all students and particularly all students of color,” he added.
Though the event was meant to bring together a variety of perspectives on the topic, some audience members said they felt the panelists were not representative of the range of opinions on the suit.
“I think that today's discussion did shed light on a lot of things that I did not really consider as much—so it was fruitful in that perspective—but I do wish, and I've talked to a couple of other people who've felt similarly, that the panelists were more representative perhaps of different viewpoints,” Emma Lin '21, a member of the Chinese Students Association board, said.
“During the panel discussions it felt like they were kind of echoing each other's sentiments without a lot of conflict and some students kind of felt like they were dodging hard questions as well,” she added.
During the event, Cregor pointed out that lawsuits move slowly, and it may be years before the debate over Harvard’s admissions policies sees a legal resolution.
“Litigation is long,” he said. “This thing was filed in 2014. My kids were like three years old in 2014—they might graduate from high school before all of this stuff is over. So that's the snail's pace we're all working at.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2018 at 2:25 a.m.
Faculty, students, and activists gathered in Harvard Hall Friday afternoon to listen to a talk given by Asia Argento, an Italian filmmaker and one of the first women to publicly accuse film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault.
This discussion, moderated by History postdoctoral fellow Alex M. More and Leena M. Akhtar, a lecturer in History of Science and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, spanned a variety of topics—including how Argento found the courage to go public with her accusations against Weinstein. Argento also spoke about how individuals who have experienced sexual assault in the United States are treated differently than those who have experienced sexual assault in Italy.
In an interview before the event, More said inviting Argento was “the right thing to do.”
“She said it better than anybody: ‘The betterment of all women is the betterment of all humankind.’ That's why we're doing this,” More said.
Since going public with her accusations against Weinstein, Argento said she has endured a number of attacks from the media and individuals in Italy.
“This is what we're trying to change, and it's not just one country—in various versions, you see these abuses of power at work everywhere and even in our own backyard,” More said. “It needs to stop.”
During the discussion, when asked about what steps Harvard students and faculty should take to combat this phenomenon, Argento emphasized the importance of dialogue between individuals who have experienced sexual assault. She said hearing another woman’s story is ultimately what gave her the courage to speak out about her own experiences.
“I spoke about it for the first time to somebody when I was 38,” she said. “It was because somebody, a friend of mine, a woman, told me her story of rape and it was a ‘Me too,’ it was similar to mine.”
“This was the awakening for me to being able to talk about it,” Argento added.
Attendee Grace T. Western ’21 pointed to this comment as something that particularly resonated with her.
“I mostly just wanted to hear her speak,” Western said.
Western said she herself has experienced sexual assault and noted it was “really helpful” to hear “another survivor” speak about her experiences.
“Her solace was really helpful,” Western said. “Just to hear the way that she has come back from all this.”
Argento said at the event she is hopeful women will be treated better in the future.
“I believe in the evolution of the species. I think evolution in this case means equality,” she said. “I don't know how long it's going to take, I have no idea, but… I will fight for it.”
“I'm no clairvoyant, but I know that I would like to see it in my lifetime. My daughter, she's 16. I want to believe it will,” she said. “It seems impossible now because it just started so fresh, it's six months since it became a topic and hasn't stopped.
“I do have hope,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said he stands by the actions of the officers who arrested a black Harvard student Friday and said the Cambridge Police Department has not placed the officers involved on administrative leave at a press conference Monday.
The student involved in the incident is currently undergoing evaluation at a hospital for issues including mental health concerns—and the ongoing evaluation is “one of the reasons” the student has yet to be arraigned, Bard said Monday. Bard did not directly answer a question asking whether charges against the student—which include assault, indecent exposure, and resisting arrest—could be dropped in light of the undergraduate’s mental health.
“I absolutely do support the officers,” he said Monday. “You have to judge their actions within the context of a rapidly evolving situation and not within an ideal construct.”
“We operate in a practical world,” Bard said.
Bard added, though, that he is making no final determinations prior to “completing a complete and thorough investigation.” As mandated by department policy, CPD is conducting an internal review in the wake of the arrest given the incident involved use of force. Bard said Monday that CPD will make the results of this review public.
Bard also said Harvard administrators—specifically Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis—have been in touch with CPD in the wake of the arrest.  Davis previously said Harvard’s Office of General Counsel and Massachusetts Hall, traditionally a name for the University’s central administration, are “involved” in examining the Friday incident.
CPD officers arrested the undergraduate Friday after responding to several calls about the student, who was standing naked at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street. After determining the student had previously taken narcotics, law enforcement officials—including three CPD officers and one officer from the Transit Police Department—tackled the student to the ground.
A later CPD police report states the officers tackled the undergraduate after he made aggressive moves toward law enforcement. But eyewitnesses including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association have stated the officers acted “without provocation.”
While the student was on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin the student’s arms, according to the CPD police report. The student was transported to the hospital after the physical confrontation and was ultimately charged on several counts including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said in an interview after the press conference that the student is no longer being treated for injuries sustained during the arrest, but that he remains in the hospital—under police custody—for complications stemming from “drug ingestion” and from “an evaluation related to his mental health.”
Asked why the student has been charged if the incident involves concerns over the undergraduate’s mental health, Bard said the department is currently working to decide whether the student’s situation means he would be better served by “means other than the criminal justice system.”
“That’s an excellent question,” Bard said. “That is one of the reasons why the individual hasn’t been arraigned yet.”
Bard added CPD is working with individuals from multiple “entities,” including the District Attorney’s Office, to determine the best path forward.
One of the CPD officers involved is “still out” due to a leg injury he sustained during the altercation, according to Bard. Other officers present at the arrest sustained “minor” injuries, Warnick said.
BLSA has called the incident an instance of police brutality.
Bard—while emphasizing that he has not yet conducted “a frame-by-frame review” of video of the arrest—offered a detailed account and a defense of the CPD officers’ actions Monday. He noted CPD officers are trained to always use the least amount of force possible.
Bard said that, in an “ideal” world, the officers would have engaged “verbally only” with the student. Bard said videos of the event show that the officers standing around the undergraduate attempted to speak with the student “for a long period of time.” He said the officers “engaged” with the student for “minutes” before tackling him.
After efforts to talk to the undergraduate proved unsuccessful, the officers involved made the determination they needed to take the student “to the ground,” Bard said.
“The video also shows that the man wasn’t compliant while he was on the ground,” Bard said. “There’s a lot of stuff going on. He was flailing, kicking.”
In response to questioning from reporters at the briefing, Bard specifically discussed one CPD officer’s decision to repeatedly punch the student in the stomach. Bard said the student was preventing the officers from placing handcuffs on his arm—and he said CPD officers tried multiple other methods of subduing the student including using their batons.
“So they continued other measures, other control holds, other uses of their batons, to try to get the arm leverage from underneath the man’s body,” Bard said. “It’s a very difficult thing to do. If anyone’s ever had to constrain an individual against their will, they’ll know that it’s a very difficult thing to do.”
In the wake of the arrest, some Harvard students have questioned whether University procedures were properly followed during the incident. Eyewitnesses including members of BLSA stated that callers contacted Harvard University Health Services about the student first but that HUHS transferred the callers to CPD. Some undergraduates have questioned why CPD was contacted in lieu of the Harvard University Police Department or other resources.
Bard appeared to cast doubt on that version of events Monday. He said CPD received the information about the undergraduate from “emergency communications.”
Asked specifically whether CPD spoke to HUHS, Bard said, “I don’t believe we did at that time.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano has said that HUPD was “aware” of the call about the student, but that the undergraduate was already under arrest when HUPD officers arrived at the scene.
A spokesperson for HUHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bard also addressed a BLSA statement, published over the weekend, that stated CPD officers attempted to prevent bystanders from filming the arrest.  CPD’s policies recognize that individuals have the “right under the First Amendment to openly record police activity in public in a peaceful manner,” according to BLSA’s statement.
“It was clear to our Harvard BLSA members that CPD officers were not following these procedures,” the statement reads. “But for our members’ persistence in defying police attempts to obstruct videotaping this incident, there would be no record.”
Bard said Monday he has seen no evidence to support this statement.
“The allegation that officers were stopping anyone from filming, I haven’t seen any evidence of that,” he said. “And if there is some evidence, I would like to have it. Because it would be a clear violation of policy.”
The BLSA statement over the weekend noted that “a pool of blood remained on the pavement” as the ambulance carrying the student departed the scene Friday night.
Bard said at the press conference he is unsure whether the blood on the ground stemmed from injuries the student suffered during the altercation.
“While it can be inferred that any injury to the mouth occurred during the struggle with police, the male could have had, could have suffered from injuries prior to use getting there,” Bard said.  “We don’t really know.”
“Once again, the investigation is ongoing,” he added.
Bard said had a community coffee chat over the weekend to which “some concerned minority Harvard students” showed up, leading to “frank and open discussions.”
He said he also attended a pre-planned church event Sunday at which he spoke with many “concerned” Harvard students.
“We had candid conversations behind the issues of racist policing,” Bard said.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern called the events “disturbing” in a statement Sunday. Bard said his department is attempting to operate in an equitable manner.
“This agency has gone through great lengths to make sure that we do everything through the lens of procedural justice, and try to make sure that everything we do is fair, transparent, that we providing the community with a voice and that we are impartial,” Bard said.
Warnick said the department is planning to announce new units that “are going to address procedural justice and social policing” some time in the coming months and weeks.  Warnick noted these announcements had already been in the works “well before” the Friday arrest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard and Penn men’s lacrosse teams both entered Saturday’s contest in Philadelphia, Penn., looking to break out of weeks-long funks. While the Crimson had dropped two in a row, the Quakers had lost their past three, and with the calendar inching towards May, when the top four squads in the Ivy League will be invited to New York to participate in the conference tournament, every loss was becoming more and more costly.
Accordingly, the two sides came out of the locker rooms with a sense of urgency, putting up a combined nine shots in the first six minutes of action. Senior midfielder Carney Mahon opened the scoring for Harvard at the 11:01 mark of the quarter, but Penn had its chances as well, with sophomore attackman Adam Goldner forcing a good save from Crimson netminder Robert Shaw just two minutes later.
By the time the teams reached halftime, they had traded 3-0 runs and were back to square one, knotted at 3-3. In the third quarter, however, the Quakers cranked up the intensity on offense, putting four in a row past Shaw in quick succession to cap a 7-0 run spanning nearly 30 minutes. The home side never looked back, keeping its opponents at bay throughout the rest of the half to secure a 11-7 victory.
With the four-goal win, Penn (6-6, 2-3 Ivy) puts itself back in contention for a spot in the Ivy tournament. The Quakers now sit in fifth place in the conference standings, a half-game behind Brown (5-5, 2-2) and Harvard (7-4, 2-2), each with one fewer loss. The Crimson, meanwhile finds itself with a must-win next week at home against Princeton (6-5, 1-3) before finishing off the season against undefeated No. 6 Yale (9-2, 5-0).
“We have a big week in front of us,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “We’re really going to see what we’re made of, coming off of a difficult stretch, but we’ll be playing at home again and we need to capitalize on that.”
It certainly has been a difficult “road trip” for the Crimson, as the team has been outscored, 40-24, in three consecutive losses away from Cambridge, Mass. The schedule was undoubtedly a factor, with Harvard facing off against Albany and Cornell, which were ranked No. 1 and No. 10 at the time, respectively, before taking on Penn, who beat another former No. 1, Duke, earlier this year.
Against the Quakers, perhaps the weakest of the three opponents, however, the Crimson finally had the start it wanted. Harvard raced out to a 3-0 lead on the contributions of Mahon and the team’s two leading goal scorers, senior Morgan Cheek and sophomore Kyle Anderson.
The offense then went silent, however, not finding the back of the net between the 2:27 mark of the first quarter and the 0:01 mark of the third.
“Penn has a good defense, but it was more a matter of us not executing properly at our own game,” said Crimson captain and midfielder Joe Lang. “We were sloppy with the ball, losing it when we could’ve had good scoring chances, and that’s something we’ll need to work on this week.”
If it were not for Anderson’s goal in the final second of the third quarter, Harvard would have gone scoreless in the frame. As is, the troubling trend of poor starts after halftime continues. During its losing streak, the Crimson has now been outscored by its opponents by a total margin of 12-3 in the third quarters, leaving the team to watch as tight games turn into big deficits before even reaching the final period.
“We made some costly turnovers there in the third quarter that really put us on the back foot,” Wojcik said. “Our play across the board was better than in past weeks, especially getting ground balls, but when you hand over possession again and again, that’s tough to overcome.”
Harvard turned the ball over five times in that frame, compared to nine all game for the Quakers.
Converting man-up opportunities was another aspect of the Crimson performance that was lacking on Saturday, as the team went 0-6 in such opportunities. Penn committed seven penalties, giving their visitors a full 5:30 of man-up play. Harvard, however, was not able to capitalize.
In terms of individual performances, Goldner and senior attackman Kevin McGeary led the way for the Quakers with four points apiece, while Cheek matched their output in a losing effort.
“We’re disappointed, obviously, but the goal remains the same as it did at the beginning of the season,” Lang said. “Qualify for the Ivy tournament, and win that tournament. Everything is still in our hands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rising early in the morning for an 8:30 a.m. start, the No. 2 Harvard men’s lightweight came to the line against No. 9 Dartmouth and No. 12 MIT in the hopes of capturing the Biglin Bowl for the 55th time. And as with every Bowl race since 2009, the Crimson emerged victorious.
The boat, stroked by junior David Wexner and steered by junior coxswain Jack Stone, erupted off the starting line and never looked back, finishing eight seconds ahead of the Big Green and nine seconds ahead of the Engineers in a time of 5:45.126.
“We had a pretty quick start getting off the line,” Stone said. “We rowed at about a 46, 47, and it was a crosstail, so it was quick conditions, and we were going pretty quick throughout. We were up early on, but we kept widening the margin and especially coming off the Mass Ave. Bridge, that’s when we really took more distance on the other two crews.”
Stone said that the first varsity boat, which has maintained a consistent lineup throughout the season, is hitting its stride.
“I think this both is really getting into great rhythm,” Stone said. “We’ve been rowing the same lineup for more than a few weeks now, and things are really geling with each practice. It seems to just get better and better, so I think we can see that coming from the race against Columbia and Georgetown last weekend that we rowed a better race down the basin even against teams that weren’t as tough as Columbia.”
Stone also noted the strong performances of the other boats, which he says indicate the depth of the team. The Crimson’s second varsity boat captured its race in 5:59.500, and Harvard’s third, fourth, and fifth varsity boats breezed past Dartmouth’s 3V as well.
“It shows just what a great and deep program that we are with focus on all five boats every single week, and just great effort from all the guys and all the boats,” Stone said.
The No. 6 Radcliffe lightweight crew team traveled to Lake Merce in West Windsor Township, N.J., to compete in the Knecht Cup. In the varsity eight grand final, the first varsity eight finished sixth in 6:48.59, 10 seconds behind Penn. In the lightweight eight grand final, the Black and White earned fifth in 6:50.24, while Boston University’s A squad took the race. The lightweight four placed sixth as well in 7:58.67 in the varsity four grand final, a race that Quakers captured again. 
Radcliffe also competed in the finals of three other races. The Black and White placed sixth in the in the lightweight four petite final in 8:18.17, sixth in the second varsity four final in 8:02.07, and second in the novice four final in 8:03.66.
The No. 7 men’s heavyweight crew stayed in Cambridge over the weekend and battled Ancient Eight rival Princeton in a tight contest for the Compton Cup on the Charles River over the weekend. The first varsity eight, stroked by junior Arthur Doyle and coxed by senior Cole Durbin, edged out the Tigers by two seconds in a time of 5:36.100. Sophomore David Ambler, who sat in the seventh seat of the boat, said that the team is bouncing back from a couple of injuries early in the season.
“Building off from last week, we had a disappointing result against Brown,” Ambler said. “We’ve had a few injuries this season to key guys, two of the guys from the 1V last year, Arthur Doyle and Lars Loch were out, and they’re two critical guys in our team, so having them back in the boat was a huge bonus. Obviously, Arthur in the stroke seat makes a huge difference, so it was just a calmer, clearer race, and we were rowing more in the way that we’ve been coached so far and that we really want to be doing, so that’s good.”
Ambler recognized the strong mental and physical preparation of the crew going into this weekend. The next couple of weeks will bring more swift competition to the waters of the Charles and beyond.
“Well, ultimately our season is built towards racing Yale in June, so we’ve got a few more dual races to go, and then really the key stepping stones for us are at the moment are we’ve got a big dual race coming up against Northeastern, who are looking pretty strong, and that’s our last race before Eastern Sprints, and then from Eastern Springs, it’s IRAs, and then IRAs to Harvard-Yale,” Ambler said.
For all crews, including the women’s heavyweight crew which was not in action this weekend, future clashes with strong programs means that the grueling, strenuous training regiment must continue, all in the hopes of shaving seconds off of times, increasing margins of victories, and ultimately capturing championship victories later in the season.
“There’s still a long season to go. We’re a month away from Springs,” said Stone of the lightweight crew’s schedule moving forward. “We have a tough race against Navy this weekend, and then against Yale and Princeton the weekend after that. We’re going to keep training hard and working hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a win over a strong Northeastern team, the Harvard baseball team entered last weekend coming off a huge Beanpot championship win. No shortage of confidence could be found on the squad as the Bad Boys of Boston drove down to West Haven, Conn., last Friday to take on conference leader Yale.
The three-game tilt started off with a bang.
Senior righty Noah Zavolas threw a dazzling no-hit performance in a 4-0 win on Friday evening, bringing a perfect game into the eighth inning before allowing a baserunner on an error. The victory moved the Crimson briefly over the .500 mark to 4-3 in conference play.
“Definitely one of the biggest games I’ve ever pitched,” said Zavolas of his no-hitter. “Really, really special night, especially being able to go out there on a Friday night against our rival. To be able to play under the lights was beautiful, in a setting like Yale. Just an incredible night all around.”
The senior, taking the mound for his 17th career start in a Crimson jersey, pounded the strike zone all game, KO’ing 12 Bulldog hitters and inducing 12 ground ball outs. Zavolas’s final line: 9.0 IP, no hits, no runs, and one walk.
“I have a good view from center field and watching him pitch was pretty incredible,” said junior center fielder Ben Skinner. “That was, by far, the best pitching performance I’ve ever seen. I mean, obviously no-hitters are extremely rare, but just the way he got ahead of hitters, minimized mistakes, and how every pitch was purposeful and located extremely well, was honestly awesome to watch.”
Despite the pitcher’s dream accomplishment, however, Harvard couldn’t muster the same magic the next day, losing both games of Saturday’s doubleheader to drop to 4-5 in the Ivy League and 14-16 overall. Yale (14-15, 9-3 Ivy League), meanwhile, remains atop the Ancient Eight standings.
The Crimson now sits sixth in the Ivy table, behind Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Penn. Harvard has already dropped two of three to Columbia and won two of three against Penn but has yet to play Princeton and Dartmouth.
Even after Zavolas’s historic game, the series loss means that the Crimson will need to essentially win out, as pointed out by Zavolas himself, if it aims to climb back into Ivy League contention.
“We have a pretty unique opportunity this coming week because we have the makeup series against Princeton on Tuesday and Wednesday,” Zavolas said. “If we can have some success there, it’s really a matter of controlling our own destiny from there on out.”
YALE 4, HARVARD 1
Zavolas wasn’t the only lights-out pitcher in the dugouts over the weekend. The Harvard offense met an immovable force on Saturday evening, as Bulldogs senior Eric Brodkowitz tossed a complete-game, four-hit, one-run effort to stake Yale to a 4-1 series-capping win over the visitors.
The top third of the order were the only three Crimson players who could touch Brodkowitz.
Skinner went 1-for-4 in the leadoff spot, junior first baseman Pat McColl went 2-for-3, and sophomore right fielder Jake Suddleson went 1-for 4 in the three-hole. The rest of the lineup went hitless.
“We ran into a guy with good stuff who was really on that day,” Skinner said. “He had a few different pitches working for him, which is tough.”
Harvard countered with junior righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson, who pitched a five-inning, two-run effort to keep his team in the game. Rosenblum-Larson has now pitched 42.2 innings on the year and has a 3.16 ERA, both second-best on the team.
The Crimson, however, was hurt by sloppy defensive play, as one of the Bulldog’s four runs was unearned, and two more scored on wild pitches.
In the cleanup role, senior designated hitter Austin Black gathered the only RBI on a groundout in the ninth to drive in McColl and bring the score to 4-1. It didn’t matter, though, as Brodkowitz got third baseman Hunter Bigge to line out in the next at-bat to end the game.
“Going forward, we’re going to stick with our same approach, trying to keep putting runs on the board,” Skinner said. “We’re confident in our offense—we’ve proven this year that we’re a team that can put up a lot of runs. We’re trying to have a short memory with [the loss], but it obviously wasn’t the outcome we were looking for.”
YALE 10, HARVARD 6
A day after being no-hit, the Bulldogs came back with vigor, scoring in the first inning against Bigge, who was making his seventh appearance on the mound as a two-way player this season. Harvard stayed close for awhile, tying the game briefly, but it was Yale that emerged victorious after it exploded for eight runs across the sixth and seventh innings.
Junior catcher Devan Peterson’s grand slam wasn’t enough to key a large enough late-inning comeback as the Crimson fell 10-6 on Sunday afternoon.
McColl led the way for Harvard, going 3-for-4 at the plate, helping the junior raise his post-series average to .286. A huge part of Yale’s success, however, was in not allowing McColl—the Crimson’s RBI leader—to register a single RBI during the series.
Four relievers followed Bigge to the mound for Harvard. Sophomore righty Grant Stone got the loss after giving up all five runs of Yale’s crooked sixth inning, which gave the Bulldogs a 7-2 lead.
Suddleson, hitting in the three-hole, drove in two runners—though officially, only one RBI—on a single in the top of the sixth. The knock tied the game, at that point, at two runs apiece, though Yale pulled away in the bottom half against Stone.
The two teams combined for 25 hits and 16 runs, though the Bulldogs outhit the Crimson 14-11.
HARVARD 4, YALE 0
The highlight of Harvard’s weekend was undoubtedly watching its veteran pitcher go to work against the Ivy League leaders.
Mowing through a Yale lineup with the conference’s second-highest batting average, Zavolas faced just two above the minimum 27 and made it look effortless on the mound. The no-no was the Crimson’s first in 17 years, when former Harvard standout Ben Crockett, now in the Red Sox front office, did it against Dartmouth in the 2001 season finale.
“Really, it was just getting ahead early and often,” Zavolas said. “Getting in counts that I was behind in, being able to come back, especially with offspeed stuff—a lot of breaking balls in fastball counts, to keep hitters kind of on their heels. It really was a story of throwing pitches for strikes the whole night.”
Zavolas is now 4-1 as a starter this season and has a 3.38 overall ERA. The senior ranks fourth in the conference with a 2.35 Ivy-only ERA and second with a .218 batting average against.
The starter got backup in the form of the whole squad, as the Crimson recorded ten knocks and four different Harvard players registered RBIs.
After Suddleson and Black got in base to lead off the top of the second, Bigge singled home a run. Following another hit by junior catcher Jake Allen, freshman shortstop Buddy Mrowka hit a bases-loaded single and Skinner tacked on another run with an RBI groundout to give Zavolas an early 3-0 lead to work with.
Zavolas responded by getting a 1-2-3 inning in the bottom of the second. The rest is history, as the Acton, Mass., native went on to set down the first 23 Yale batters in a row.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ever-fickle New England weather forced Harvard softball to bump up its series against Penn by one day, as Friday’s sunny, seasonal temperature seemed preferable to blustery, wintry conditions forecast for Sunday.
Though the weather cooled down by Saturday afternoon, the Crimson’s bats did not. Harvard (18-12, 11-4 Ivy) scored 25 runs in its three games versus the visiting Quakers (12-18, 7-8), and the team picked up its second Ivy League series sweep out of five such series this season. Just Dartmouth and Brown remain as conference opponents before the end of the regular season.
“It was a really great weekend to come out and get the series win,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “[The Dartmouth series] is probably our biggest weekend in the past two years, so we’re really excited. We’re just going to keep the momentum going.”
The Crimson’s top performers over the weekend were a pair of familiar faces. Rich went 9-for-12 with two doubles, a triple, five runs scored, 3 RBI, and no strikeouts. Southpaw Katie Duncan started Friday’s game and came out of the bullpen in both games of Saturday’s doubleheader. The junior threw 14.2 innings without allowing an earned run, winning the first two contests and closing out the series with a save.
HARVARD 8, PENN 2
Whereas a defensive miscue allowed Penn to claw back into Saturday’s first game, the second half of the doubleheader saw Harvard exhibit more poise on defense, most notably in the top of the second. Starter Sarah Smith jammed Quakers pitcher Abigail Abramson on an inside fastball, and Abramson popped it up down the third base line. Junior third baseman Erin Lockhart gave chase, sprinting toward Penn’s dugout. At the last second, she dove and caught the foul ball just as it was about to touch dirt.
Besides inducing this popout, Smith was otherwise brilliant in the circle. The junior dealt in fours, as she recorded her fourth win with four innings of one-run ball and four strikeouts.
Duncan picked up where Smith left off, tossing the final three frames to record her second save of 2018. Duncan flummoxed the Quakers’ lineup with a bevy of strikes on the corners, prompting one Penn fan—apparently mystified by the plate umpire’s strike zone—to repeatedly question Duncan’s called strikes, but the umpire appeared unfazed.
Offensively, it was business as usual for the high-powered Crimson offense. Harvard scored at least eight runs for the third straight game, fueled by five extra base hits. Rich smacked two doubles, and co-captain Maddy Kaplan and senior Dallas Hogan also recorded two-baggers.
Perhaps the most impressive hit of the day came in the bottom of the sixth, however. Four consecutive singles scored three runs for the Crimson before the Quakers could make an out, and junior Meagan Lantz later stepped up with a runner on first and one out. The second baseman turned on an offering from Penn left-hander Tabitha Dyer, launching a high fly toward the wall in left-center. The violent winds cutting in from center field made the ball hang up in the cold spring air for what seemed like an eternity, and it eventually landed at the base of the wall for a triple.
“Definitely,” said coach Jenny Allard in response to a question about whether the conditions impacted fly balls on Saturday. “I think that last ball of Meagan Lantz’s would’ve gone out.”
HARVARD 8, PENN 7
After a flurry of scoring set up a 7-5 Harvard lead in the first three innings, the Crimson and the Quakers settled down in the following three innings, holding each other scoreless. Heading into the top of the seventh, Harvard needed just three outs to cinch the series victory.
With one out and runners on first and second, however, Penn took advantage of a play replete with fielding errors to knot the game at seven. The Crimson failed to walk it off in the bottom of the seventh, setting up an extra-innings battle.
Duncan stayed in the circle for the top of the eighth, quickly retiring the side with a trio of groundouts. Harvard had to figure out Abramson, who to that point had been marvellous—the freshman had pitched 4.2 scoreless innings of relief.
And figure out Abramson the Crimson did. Rich launched a triple to right field to open up the inning, and Kaplan followed with a walk-off sacrifice fly to center fielder Katie Petroski.
“They’ve got confidence,” Allard said. “They’re poised. So when they get down, they don’t panic. We knew what we could do and we just tried to work the execution, and it worked out.”
Senior outfielder Alexa Altchek and Lockhart each doubled in the victory, and Kaplan stole her fourth base of the season.
HARVARD 9, PENN 1 (6 INNINGS)
Harvard started off its weekend series with a bang, scoring five runs in the first two innings and never looking back. The Crimson tacked on four runs in the fifth and sixth to halt the game early via the eight-run mercy rule.
Harvard’s four-run first inning was punctuated by a two-run shot off the bat of first baseman Olivia Giaquinto, the fourth of her sophomore campaign. Giaquinto now has 11 homers and an .840 OPS in her young career.
Giaquinto also played a part in the Crimson’s other big offensive inning by leading off the fifth with a single. After Harvard subsequently loaded the bases, Hogan punched a single up the middle to score pinch runner Isabelle Haugh, and Rich followed with a gap shot to left-center, bringing in Lindey Kneib and Alyssa Saldana.
The Crimson manufactured a run in the following frame to ice the contest. Altchek walked, advanced to second on a Giaquinto groundout, and scampered to third on a wild pitch. Kneib singled into center field, pushing across the winning run in the process.
In customary fashion, Duncan shut down the opposing lineup without overpowering hitters. She struck out just one Quaker but also gave up just one unearned run. On the season Duncan has stranded runners on base left and right, as evidenced by her 2.58 ERA and 1.45 WHIP.
“She’s a really strong, tenacious player,” Rich said. “One of our key words for this year has been fortitude, and she is really the great example of that. Even if she doesn’t have her best stuff, she always manages to come out on top, and it was great to see her have a good weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a six-game win streak and recent defeat of 11-season consecutive EIVA division champion Penn State in the rearview mirror, Harvard traveled to George Mason for the EIVA regular season championship match with a beefy résumé.
However, on Friday at the Recreation and Athletic Complex the Crimson failed to record win needed to secure a regular season conference title. Dropping both games to its Patriot rivals, the team left Virginia with the division’s second seed and a rematch with Penn State scheduled for Thursday in the EIVA semi-finals.
“For Penn State, we’ve seen what they can throw at us earlier this season and handled it, so we’re focusing on simply sticking to our system and playing our game,” captain outside hitter Jack Heavey said. “We’re watching film and practicing tendencies, but we know that it comes down to our ability to execute on our side that’s going to determine that match.”
GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 1
With one loss under its belt, the Crimson came out swinging on Saturday against the division’s top opponent. That materialized in a quick 5-0 lead and then again as senior Marko Kostich registered three kills in the 25-18 first set victory. The senior setter recorded a team-high 13 kills across all three sets, while in the first set alone, the group accomplished 12 kills for a match high .440 hitting percentage.
The second meeting between the squads merited a 3-1 finish after Harvard took set number one, 25-18, before dropping the subsequent three sets, 17-25, 20-25, 19-25. However, its fate for the EIVA tournament already determined, the team rested many of its starters during the grudge match.
“After we lost Friday night we already knew we would be playing in the two vs three game of playoffs,” said co-captain and middle blocker Riley Moore. “It was more important to get a few key guys rest than it was to fight for extra wins in the record books.”
Leading in kills, Kostich also finished with a team-high .545 attack percentage and 10 assists en route to his fifth career double-double. On the other side of the net, the Patriots’ sophomore outside hitter Sam Greenslade punished the Crimson defense with personal-best 21 kills across the four sets. Teammate junior setter Justin Coleman led the squad in assists with a match-high 24 assists.
George Mason thrived on runs. In the final stanza of the match, the Patriots established themselves early on. George Mason found an early lead with four straight points to push the score to 6-4. Harvard managed to push back and maintain a one point deficit at 6-8 before the Patriots took over, hitting a five-point lead as the team went up 15-10 before another three point run pushed the group to 20-14. From there the set was all but sealed with George Mason leaving the court and match on a 25-19 high note.
Characteristically, the Patriots found momentum early in the set with a 5-0 run that nearly mirrored the Crimson’s one set prior. The early five points presented the home team with a 6-2 lead to build on. Greenslade pushed George Mason to another four point run by leading first with a kill. The sophomore took to the service line and found the gaps in the Harvard defense, acing the squad twice building the lead to 14-8.
Just as the set began, so too did it end. On the heels of two Greenslade aces, junior Travis O’Gorman found a kill to put the exclamation point on the 5-0 run and the set, 25-17.
Sophomore setter Matthew Ctvrtlik led the team with 24-assists while accumulating nine digs and six kills as freshman outsider hitter Griffin Schmit added two of his own across the match. Sophomore libero Jack Connolly tied Ctvrtlik in digs, a team-best, as Heavey and Gordon both managed five of their own. Defensively, junior middle blocker Trevor Dow with half of the Crimson’s 10 total blocks.
With the 3-1 victory on Saturday, the Patriots finished the season with a 13-1 division record, the best in program history.
GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 2
In what was for all intents and purposes the EIVA regular season championship match, the Crimson, fresh off its upset of Penn State, traveled to Fairfax, Va., in a battle for the top seed in the EIVA Tournament this weekend. In a 3-2 decision, the Patriots ended Harvard’s six-game win streak.
An early 25-22 win for George Mason in the first set lit a fire under the bellies of the Crimson as the squad returned to the court hitting hard. A 3-0 run began the second set and established a lead the team did not relinquish until late in the set. Within the first 20 points, the closest the Patriots got to erasing the deficit was one point, at 17-16.
The scores leveled at 24, immediately following a 3-0 run by George Mason. At 27, no team had established an advantage. Two Patriot errors, however, allowed Harvard to tie up the match at one apiece.
Set three featured a similar burst in the beginning but remained neck and neck throughout with 14 lead changes. Hitting a 6-0 run to go up 8-4, the Crimson’s lead was this time relinquished much earlier this set. George Mason called a timeout before mounting a comeback to take the 12-11 lead. Several lead changes later, Harvard took the match lead with a 27-25 victory.
The two subsequent sets fell to the Patriots’ offense prowess, 25-27 and 11-15, respectively. For the Crimson, senior hitter Brad Gretsch recorded his second double-double of the season racking up a career high 23 kills and 11 digs, while hitting .312 percent. Classmate Kostich nearly hit a triple double on the afternoon with nine kills, nine digs, and 24 assists. Ctvrtlik led the team in assists with 26.
On the defensive side of the net, sophomore outside hitter Erik Johnsson led the team with 13 digs while Connolly had a career best of 10.
This match represented the first time this season that George Mason has five players with double digit kills in a match.
The victory for the Patriots secured the regular season championship for the team and the number one seeding for the EIVA Tournament this weekend. It also represents the first time in 11 seasons that someone other than Penn State has held the title. Along with the seeding, George Mason also earns home court advantage four the 2018 rendition of the tournament and chance to play the NCAA tournament.
“Playing Penn State and it being a playoff game we understand how important this is,” Moore said. “We will be working the next two days before heading back to Virginia to make sure we are refocused on their players and get our rhythm back after a hard weekend.”
