After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 5, 2017 at 4:47 p.m. 
Law enforcement officials arrested an escaped federal prisoner suspected of attempting to rob a bank in Central Square Thursday, according to the Massachusetts State Police.
Investigators named James W. Morales, a fugitive from the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Center in Rhode Island, as matching the physical description of the suspect in an attempted bank robbery in Central Square. Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies searched for Morales throughout the Thursday afternoon and apprehended him in Somerville after a foot chase.
Morales went missing from the Detention Center last weekend and had since been pursued by the United States Marshall Service. A former Army reservist, Morales was placed at the Detention Center for allegedly stealing assault weapons and handguns from a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Worcester, Mass. He will be booked in Medford, Mass., the State Police reported on Twitter.
The suspect entered a Bank of America in Central Square Thursday and passed a note demanding money, but he did not succeed in robbing the bank, the CPD reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixteen Harvard Law School faculty members have joined thousands of other law professors across the country in signing a letter opposing Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions’s nomination as United States Attorney General.
In the letter, originally published Jan. 3, the authors raise concerns about Sessions’s civil rights record, his support for constructing a wall on the border between Mexico and the United States, and his opposition to legislation authors say advance the rights of women and LGBTQ individuals, among other issues. Law professors from several different universities first penned the letter, which is addressed to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and more than 1,300 faculty members at law schools across the country have signed it. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold confirmation hearings for Sessions, who represents Alabama, beginning Jan. 10.
“As law faculty who work every day to better understand the law and teach it to our students, we are convinced that Jeff Sessions will not fairly enforce our nation’s laws and promote justice and equality in the United States. We urge you to reject his nomination,” the letter reads.
Law School professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., who signed the letter, said Sessions’s record on voting rights, especially for minorities, is deeply troubling to him.
“The aim of the letter is to raise the significant issues about voting, which is fundamental to our democratic experiment and, once these issues are raised, we hope that the committee and the citizenry in general would not support this nominee,” Sullivan said. “We certainly think that, party affiliation aside, no Attorney General should have taken such a radical view about voting rights laws.”
Sullivan pointed to a 1985 case in which Sessions, then a United States Attorney, oversaw a team of prosecutors that charged three black voter registration activists—commonly referred to as “The Marion Three”—with violating federal mail fraud statutes and tampering with absentee ballots. Critics say that the charges Sessions brought against the black activists were unwarranted and that Sessions ignored allegations that white individuals had similarly tampered with absentee ballots in previous elections.
“He advocated a position that I deem to be unconstitutional, unpatriotic, and in violation of the foundational norms that animate our democracy,” Sullivan said.
Law School professor Lani Guinier signed the letter and served as one of the defense attorneys in the 1985 case. In an interview, she read from what she said was p. 191 of her book “Lift Every Voice,” which discusses Sessions.
“US Attorney Jeff Sessions had been quoted as saying that he ‘used to think’ the Klu Klux Klan was ‘okay’ until he found out that some members were ‘pot smokers’,” Guinier said, quoting her writing. “Sessions was also reported to have made statements that he believed the NAACP was ‘un-American’ and that the American Civil Liberties Union was ‘communist inspired.’”
Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokesperson for Sessions and a former fellow at the Institute of Politics, said Sessions’s nomination would be confirmed with votes from both Democrats and Republicans.
“This is just business as usual for the same far-left academics who trot our letters opposing just about any conservative or Republican who’s nominated to a key position by a Republican president,” Flores wrote in an emailed statement. “Jeff Sessions enjoys wide support from law enforcement organizations to civil rights leaders to victims’ rights organizations and many others.”
Law school professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, who also signed the letter, said he doubts that it will actually influence the Senate’s decision about Sessions.
“Because the Senate very rarely rejects one of its own, though, I don't really expect our letter to stop Senator Sessions from becoming the next Attorney General, which is a terrible shame for civil rights and liberties and for justice in America,” Tribe said.
Law School faculty members Deborah E. Anker, Sabrineh Ardalan, John Willshire Carrera, Christine Desan, Janet Halley, Bruce Hay, Nancy Kelly, Heather Scheiwe Kulp, Frank Michelman, Robert H. Mnookin, Joseph W. Singer, Carol S. Steiker, and Dehlia Umunna also signed the letter.

SWIMMING
No cat likes to swim—not even a big cat. Just ask the Columbia Lions.
On Tuesday, the Harvard women’s swimming team hosted Columbia (1-4, 0-4 Ivy) at Blodgett Pool. And for the 31st time in the last 32 meets against the Lions, the Crimson (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) emerged victorious, this time by a score of 173-122.
Senior Willa Wang, freshman Mikaela Dahlke, and sophomore Brittany Usinger each won two events. But dominance came across the board, as Harvard finished one-two-three in three races.
The sweeps came in the longer-distance freestyle events. Wang claimed the 1650 freestyle and the 500 freestyle in 17:03.01 and 5:02.26, respectively. Meanwhile Dahlke topped the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:51.94.
Dahlke also won the 100 freestyle in 51.60. But Columbia swimmer Mary Ashby managed second and thus prevented a sweep in this event as well.
In other races, Usinger dominated the 100 fly and the 100 butterfly. She won the former event in 56.20. And in the latter event, she posted a time of 2:03.46, three seconds faster than her closest competition.
The only other Harvard swimmer to claim first was junior Kristina Li, who led the 100 backstroke with a time of 56.55. Racing for the Lions, Julia Samson grabbed second in 57.73.
Combined with the diving competition—which took place on November 18—the Crimson claimed 10 events and maintained an undefeated record in the Ivy League.
Columbia gained some measure of redemption by taking first through fourth in the 400 IM and first through third in the 200 freestyle relay. But those performances did not prevent the Lions from slipping to 0-4 against the Ancient Eight.
DIVING
Some people start a new year with a splash. Junior Alisha Mah started 2017 without one.
In two days of diving competitions out West, Mah won two events. On Tuesday, she competed against Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah and topped the one-meter with a score of 267.90. On Wednesday, she battled Denver in Denver, Colo. and claimed first again with a score of 267.30.
As a team, Harvard posted a stronger showing against Pioneers. In this case, sophomore Katie Russ took home the one-meter with a tally of 258.90. Russ also performed well in the three-meter, finishing in third. And freshman Megan Galbreath nabbed second to round out the sweep.
Against the Utes, Galbreath was the only Crimson competitor to crack the top four in the three-meter. She ended with 249.00, good for second.

It was precisely on the third day of the year that we began to feel the familiar pang of boredom—that reliable affliction that resurfaces seasonally, and always when we're away from campus. Unless you're kicking it on the beach or adventuring through the mountains somewhere, chances are you're just as bored of winter break as we are. After all, sleeping in till late afternoon and eating a questionable diet is glorious for only so many weeks before it gets old.
We always wondered what we should do during the second half of break, once the holiday season has faded away. Luckily for you, we found an answer in the 90s sitcom Seinfeld. We bring you Festivus, your new favorite atypical holiday "for the rest of us."   
The Story of Festivus: Featured in the Seinfeld episode "The Strike," (as if we Harvardians haven't had enough of strikes) Festivus is an alternative winter holiday traditionally celebrated on Dec. 23. If you missed it this year, don’t worry—flout this "deadline" just as readily as many of you have apparently flouted the deadline to register for Harvard Key. After all, Mr. Costanza created the holiday to cover up his failure to buy George a Christmas present (a position many of us were in, no doubt).
The Festivus Pole: The joyless alternative to a Christmas tree. Rest an aluminum pole in the corner of the dining room to bring some Festivus spirit to your party. But ditch the tinsel and ornaments—the Costanza family rejected the unnecessary byproducts of “ commercialism.”
Airing of Grievances: The true cornerstone of Festivus. Every attendee must direct a “grievance” (complaint) at someone who has wronged them in the past year. Take this opportunity to purge a year’s worth of anger. You’d be surprised how real this can get. Just think of it as your #festivusclapback
Feats of Strength: No one can leave the party until the head of the household has been pinned. Nominate one attendee to tackle the host to the ground. Watch the ensuing chaos with holiday glee.
