After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the year 2077. More than half a century ago, aliens called Scavengers invaded Earth, destroying the moon and much of humanity. Although humans ultimately defeated the “Scavs,” Earth was rendered uninhabitable by the war, and survivors were forced to evacuate to Titan, Saturn’s largest moon.
So goes the story of humanity’s would-be demise, narrated by Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) at the beginning of “Oblivion.” Jack—otherwise known as Tech 49—is one of the last humans on Earth, along with communications officer Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough). Together, they maintain a system of drones, designed to protect a number of monolithic towers that extract energy from Earth’s oceans. Matters get complicated when Jack rescues a woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from a spaceship wreckage, especially because she’s the mysterious person from Jack’s dreams.
The plot quickly accelerates from there—but it’s impossible to ignore the stunning visuals and filmography of the film’s first half. Director Joseph Kosinski, who made his directorial debut with “Tron: Legacy” in 2010, definitely accomplishes with “Oblivion” an original visual spectacle while simultaneously paying homage to science-fiction films of the past.
From the film’s first scene, Kosinski establishes a very polished and futuristic aesthetic. Despite being a “mop-up crew” at the end of the world, Jack and Victoria certainly live in luxury—their base of operations lies at the top of an impossibly high tower and includes large glass windows and even a swimming pool. Albeit improbable, these home features allow Kosinski to pull off some incredibly beautiful shots through the manipulation of shadows—in one stunning scene, Riseborough’s silhouette is illuminated by a sunset as she stands in a pool.
Kosinski also evokes a very silent majesty with expansive, empty landscapes of post-apocalyptic Earth. Through extensive use of daylight, “Oblivion” showcases a very different end of the world, reminiscent of Ridley Scott’s “Prometheus”—incidentally, both films were shot in Iceland. Kosinski includes a more deliberate allusion to “The Matrix” in a later scene that directly recalls that earlier film with an impressive, updated feel. When Jack explores the ruins of the Empire State Building, the dusty interior set clearly reflects Kosinski’s attention to visual detail. The film’s soundtrack, composed by French band M83 and Joseph Trapanese, highlights the film’s wide array of exterior and interior visuals without being intrusive; however, this comes at the cost of memorability. M83’s effort sounds like a dilute version of Hans Zimmer’s work, effectively serving as a supportive score but failing to stand well on its own.
Visual innovation in “Oblivion” is bolstered by strong performances from Cruise and Riseborough, who have excellent romantic chemistry during the film’s first half. The sexual energy between the pair adds to the beautiful cinematography, as in the aforementioned pool scene. Kurylenko’s first screen appearances lack substantial dialogue or development, but her later performance makes up for this with emotional depth. Morgan Freeman’s brief appearance in the film’s latter half feels more facilitative for the plot than anything else, but Freeman’s poise and acting style perfectly suit his role. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays a minor character not far from his more familiar role of Jaime Lannister—but it’s refreshing to see Coster-Waldau outside of “Game of Thrones.”
While “Oblivion” succeeds artistically and features a strong cast, its writing occasionally borders on being overly sentimental and fails to take the film’s unique premise towards a strong conclusion. Science-fiction films such as “Inception” succeed because their premise and plot lend themselves to creative and inquisitive discussion. “Oblivion” strives to do so, with pithy allusions to Thomas Macaulay’s “Horatius” and strong, provocative themes of individuality and free will. However, the film doesn’t attempt to make meaningful forays into these thematic ideas, although such a failure doesn’t change its entertainment value. The film touches briefly on themes such as individuality and free will, but brushes by them on the way to visually satisfying scenes.
In every respect, “Oblivion” surpasses most of the blockbuster productions present in the box office today—it’s bold, beautiful, and engaging. Yet given the potential of its premise, it’s difficult not to wonder if “Oblivion” could have been much more.

On April 25 at 7:30 p.m., Farkas Hall will transform into a Motown palace complete with tinsel, back-up dancers, flashy costumes, and 106 stage lights directed from the back of the stage out at the audience. “Dreamgirls” follows soulful starlets the Dreams as they belt their way to the top of the charts despite racial tensions present in the 1960s and ’70s.
“‘Dreamgirls’ has music you don’t hear a lot in musical theater,” co-director Lanair A. Lett ’14 says. “R&B, Motown, and a little bit of funk and gospel music are all genres that rarely come into musical theater, especially here at Harvard.”
This production is put on by the Harvard Black Community and Student Theater Group, which puts on usually two shows per year and focuses on the talents of the African-American student body.
Co-director and outgoing president of BlackC.A.S.T. Rachel V. Byrd ’13 says that each year the organization chooses a production that will generate a lot of enthusiasm.
“What can we do to serve the community’s needs? What do people want? What do people love?” she says. For her and Lett, the choice to put on “Dreamgirls” this year made sense because of the wealth of talented singers in Harvard’s African-American community.
“It’s the only musical that comes close to being a R&B musical opera,” Lett says.
In addition to flashy set design, “Dreamgirls” will also feature songs not included in the 2006 film version with Beyoncé, Jennifer Hudson, and Jamie Foxx.
Lett says that the vocal talent is the center of the production and the inspiration for a lot of the directing and design choices. “The audience can expect to be taken places by these voices,” Lett says.

In 1818, the 18-year-old Mary Shelley published “Frankenstein,” but some scholars say her novel had significant input from her young husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. The relationship between the couple and their supposed collaboration on “Frankenstein” is the subject of “Sea Change,” the new play by director and writer Daniel J. Giles ’13, opening on the Loeb Mainstage on April 26.
In the play, actors, musicians, and puppeteers alike chronicle Percy Shelley’s early death and Mary’s attempt to reanimate her love for her late husband through her own memories.
“This is the way grief works,” Giles says. “Mary Shelley is trying to recreate her memories of her life with him so she creates this younger version of herself.”
The older, grieving Mary (Emily B. Hyman ’13) watches as a younger version of herself (Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13) experiences a relationship with both Percy and the the process of writing “Frankenstein.” Eventually, the younger Mary becomes frustrated with the way the older Mary is telling the story, and the two fight for control of the memories.
The play only has four named roles—the two versions of Mary, an older Percy (John L. Pizzato ’16), and a younger Percy (Bryan D. Kauder ’14)—but the rest of the performance is populated by puppets and their puppeteers. These eerie string-and-cardboard puppets created by Georgina B. Parfitt ’13 and Jacob A. Brandt ’14 play out scenes from “Frankenstein” as Mary and Percy’s relationship develops in parallel, all accompanied by original music by Samuel G. Ruchman ’15.
“There really is no art form that isn’t represented in this production,” stage manager Magdalene M. Zier ’16 says.
With elements including painted-on costumes designed by Anne E. M. McGrath ’13, live musicians on stage, and the silent, tender motions of the uncanny puppets, Zier and Hyman say that “Sea Change” will be exceptional because of the range of talented undergraduates working on the production.
Giles took his previous show “CryHurtFood” to a drama festival in the U.K. When asked if he is thinking of doing something similar with “Sea Change,” Giles is hesitant.
“They’re young people, and they’re brilliant, and they want more than anything to be geniuses,” he says of his play’s Mary and Percy. “This one feels like it belongs here.”

Midway  through “Beowulf - A Thousand Years of Baggage,” a new Banana Bag &  Bodice production playing at OBERON until May 5, Grendel’s mother  emerges in the blue eerie light to mourn the death of her son and accuse  Beowulf of being “a filthy fascist that killed a slightly retarded  child.” This is the kind of offbeat and unapologetic tomfoolery that  characterizes the rest of the play, which has a new script written by  Jason Craig and based on the heroic epic poem. With a mix of folksy  belting, thumb war games, and a mock magician’s act, “Beowulf” could   hardly be more genre-bending and avant-garde. At times it risks being  as raw and in-your-face as Lady Gaga’s meat dress, only longer and less  symbolic. Though the show’s direction, lyrics, and overall concept prove  so shockingly anarchic that it is hard to digest the performance, its  original score and talented singing provides some redemption. Yet while  the raucous, eccentric troupe of performers seeks to defy expectations,  they fundamentally fail to sell their belief that quirky and quality can  coexist.
“Beowulf”  charts the heroic deeds of Beowulf (Jason Craig), entreated by King  Hrothgar of the Danes (Brian McCorkle) to help get rid of the man-eating  monster Grendel (Rick Burkhardt). This interpretation of the epic poem  is steered by the chorus-like narrations and interjections of three  academics, (Burkhardt, Lisa Clair, and Jessica Jelliffe), gathering to  discuss the text. This framing device makes for well-timed academic  quips about “thematics” and the “testeronic archetype” that do well to  poke fun at the stilted academic establishment. However, the idea soon  becomes exhausted by the general awkwardness of the actors and their  lines. In one scene, the academics monotonously interject into the rowdy  action of the plot to report, “We witness death and carnage constructed  by the Grendel beast.” Clair and Jelliffe are counterbalanced by a  sillier, more inebriated Burkhardt—a frivolous male persona who prefers  to flail water bottles and gallivant amongst the audience instead of  dissecting the poem. Rather than serving up light-hearted entertainment,  Burkhardt seems more of a hindrance to the plot. Later in the play,  when he doubles up as the character of Grendel, he continues to play  both the academic and Grendel as the same character—that of the  thumb-sucking fool—rather than differentiating between the two distinct  characters.
As  one of the more successful elements of the show, the music succeeds at  furthering the concept of pastiche performance. Composer Dave Molloy  creates buzzing techno music and eclectic fusions of funk, techno,  gypsy, and folk to provide a modern spin. The singing talent helps to  redeem some of the weaknesses of the script and acting. Back-up singers  Anna Ishida and Shaye Troha harmonize well and double successfully as  back-up dancers and warrior friends to Beowulf. McCorkle blesses his  ballads with rock-blues vocals, croaking and wincing his way through a  hipster rendition of a meaty, Nordic sound. Sporting a beard and musty  dressing robe, McCorkle is more Kings of Leon than King of the Danes as  he turns the passionate confession “I need Beowulf” into a soulful  version of “Someone Like You.” His voice is supported by the gypsy  strains of the clarinet and his own performance on the accordion and  piano. Another singing highlight is Jelliffe and her high-octane, sultry  cabaret number as Grendel’s mother. In the midst of the show’s  bloodshed, phallic imagery, and swearing, Jelliffe offers a rare moment  of maternal love and loss, singing, “I held that little flower in my  arms.”
The  titular hero’s own dramatic entrance verges on ridiculous. Craig  swaggers through the audience like an old, raunchy rocker long past his  prime and proudly points to his parts as he sings repeatedly about  “horses and swords.” “I take on evil wearing only naked man-muscle,”  boasts Beowulf, a self-proclaimed man’s man. Just as in the rest of the  performance, the melodramatic and the farcical are never far apart. The  showdown scene between Grendel and Beowulf is reduced to childish thumb  wrestling and games of tag, ending with a dismembered arm falling from  the ceiling.
There  are glimmers of well-considered philosophy in the midst of the gore and  child’s play, though. The performance draws attention to the clash  between the book and the sword, rendered visually by the opposing  stances of the academic and the warrior Beowulf and suggesting a tension  between the academically derived and the physically lived experience.
The  interactive elements of the performance—characters skidding and  fighting through the audience, flying water, and flashing spotlights—do  little to improve the entertainment factor of the show. For all its  attempts to defy expectations and serve up a fresh take on an old  classic, “Beowulf” proves more weird than wonderful.

Congratulations, prospective Harvard Class of 2017. That word, “congratulations,” has probably been directed at you a lot lately, by parents, peers, and your Harvard acceptance letter; still, it is fully in order. You have endured a tortuous—and sometimes torturous—string of application requirements, a robust slate of classes and extracurriculars, an alphabet soup of standardized exams, and the months of suspense between clicking “submit” and receiving the College’s “congratulations.” And you now have the opportunity to spend four years as Harvard undergraduates.
Some of you may have already sent in your decision to matriculate here, while some of you may arrive at Harvard’s Visitas preview program juggling several tempting options and struggling to muster a life-altering decision by May 1. If this year is anything like previous ones, the majority of you will opt for Harvard. But perhaps your optimal school will instead be one tailored to a career path, or perhaps a college closer to home, or perhaps even one in Southern Connecticut with a recent spate of football losses to Harvard. We encourage you to seek out the school that suits you and your interests. But we also hope, in informing that decision, that you appreciate the true potential Harvard College has to offer.
Harvard’s 1650 charter pledged itself to “the advancement of all good literature, arts, and science.” Three and a half centuries later, that liberal arts commitment remains a core component of Harvard’s bifold breadth and depth. On the one hand, Harvard students bring their own devotions and foci. They are mathematical minds, social activists, writers, researchers, musicians, polyglots, inventors, and more—and likely not just one of the above. At the same time, the interplay of those diverse interests occurs in a liberal arts environment, promoting what Albert Einstein called “the value of a college education.” It is, he said, “the training of the mind to think.”
But Harvard is more than the sum of its academic pieces. It is also a community. Events like Housing Day or The Game—or, more recently and more poignantly, the collective response to tragedy—can attest to that. Sometimes, the community’s members, including this paper, serve up criticism, too, but that impulse derives from a shared, prevailing love for the College and an aim to see its constant betterment.
This weekend, many of you will arrive in Cambridge for the Visitas program, a chance to spend time on the campus before the May 1 deadline. The name “Visitas” is an obvious portmanteau of “visit” and Harvard’s Latin motto of truth; in fact, at its core, the weekend is geared toward discerning truth about the school and its experience. A few dozen hours may seem too scant to appraise a college, but Visitas offers a unique opportunity.  We entreat you to push past guidebooks’ or rumors’ second-hand generalities or statistics, and instead talk to students. Talk to a lot of students. And talk to your fellow prospective freshman, too, beyond the bland staples of “Where do you live?” or “Where else did you get in?” Instead, aim to understand what it means to be a student at Harvard.
Naturally, no approach is foolproof, and there is no surefire formula for a college decision. But perhaps the uncertainty, the scope of potential futures, can help fuel the excitement as you discern your best path. In that light, enjoy the weekend and enjoy this moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past half-century, Harvard University has slowly but surely acceded to unionizing efforts by thousands of workers on campus. For example, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers  organized and fought for unionization for years before finally winning recognition from the university in 1988. While University officials have on occasion resisted the organizing efforts of labor groups on campus, they have largely acquiesced to worker demands and have allowed unions to become an integral part of Harvard’s labor landscape. On-campus, unions work to ensure that Harvard treats its employees with respect. By negotiating contracts for fair wages and promotion processes, they establish a safe forum for workers to air their grievances. In the past, union organizing at Harvard has resulted in numerous victories for workers, including a successful living wage campaign in 2001. Thankfully, these efforts rippled into the larger community, providing decent wages and benefits for thousands of workers and their families.
Last year, dining hall workers at Harvard Law School organized and joined Unite Here! Local 26, the union that currently represents dining hall workers at the College. During this process, the Harvard administration remained neutral and did not seek to influence the workers’ decision. The HLS workers opted into the contract previously negotiated by Local 26 for other food-service workers, granting them the same wages and benefits enjoyed by their colleagues. Once the majority of workers expressed their desire to form a union, University officials respected their decision. Although Harvard often receives unionization efforts with trepidation, unions are clearly valued organizations on campus that deserve respect from the administration.
Unfortunately, Harvard has a different policy with regard to the organizing efforts of workers under the auspices of its off-campus investments. Harvard owns a variety of companies ranging from natural resource extractors and apartment complexes to hotels in and around the Boston area. While the University upholds admirable standards for its on-campus employees, it does not demand that those employed by its off-campus holdings be offered the same level of protection.
In 2005, Harvard purchased the DoubleTree Suites across the river in Allston, a hotel operated by Hilton Hotels Boston. Workers at the DoubleTree have accused the management of disregarding their grievances and slackening or neglecting important worker protection standards. Many other workers at the hotel cannot afford the company health insurance for their families. Even though the hotel is operated by Hilton, Harvard directly profits from these workers’ exploitation. Moreover, the University pays no real-estate taxes on the property, due to its status as a non-profit institution. The University has the capacity and the responsibility to step in and change the situation.
Against this oppressive atmosphere, the DoubleTree workers spent three months secretly organizing a fair process to decide on unionization. On March 12, over 60 workers, students, and community members petitioned the hotel’s management to give the employees a fair process to decide on unionization. With a fair process, management would agree not to intimidate workers and would allow them to unionize when more than 50 percent of the employees sign union cards. Felix G. Arroyo, councilmember at large for the city of Boston, attended the delegation and spoke to the workers and the management in favor of a fair process. His presence and continuing support shows that the plight of the DoubleTree workers resonates deeply and enjoys broad-based support from the local community. To support the workers’ right to a fair process is not a fringe political stance of the far left, and Harvard should take an active role in pressuring the hotel management to respect worker demands and assent to this fair process.
On-campus workers have the full rights and protections that accompany employment at the most prestigious university in the world. Workers at Harvard-owned businesses should be extended those same rights. Some may argue that Harvard is not responsible for the business and labor practices of its investments; however, as students who directly benefit from those investments, we have a responsibility to push our university to foster a respectful and humane labor environment on and off campus.
The workers at the DoubleTree are not fighting for unreasonable requests. They are simply asking that Harvard live up to its reputation and act as a positive force for workers in the community, a widely supported request. These working men and women are demanding the same treatment that workers on this side of river have received for decades. This Saturday at 2:15 p.m., they will rally in front of the Science Center to publicly ask the Harvard administration to give them the respect they deserve; all community members are welcome to join. The DoubleTree is Harvard’s hotel, and its workers deserve Harvard’s standards.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: January 28, 2014
An earlier version of headline of this article and statements in the article stated that the DoubleTree Suites hotel is Harvard-owned. To clarify, the company is housed in a Harvard-owned building.

By all accounts, President Obama’s address to the city of Boston at an interfaith service yesterday morning was poignant, expressing what amounted to a beautiful panegyric echoing the fact that, for various reasons, many Americans have a personal connection to the Cradle of Liberty. The speech was notable and appurtenant due to its invocation of Scripture and its appeal for prayers for those who lost loved ones in Monday’s horrific affair. The president was rightly praised for his call for resilience—few have any doubt Boston can and will “run again.”
While a prayer service is obviously not the place for politics or inadvertent fear mongering, something crucial has been missing from the government’s response thus far to the marathon bombing. Leadership. Answers. Truth in a time of unmitigated angst. While the president successfully brought the nation together to mourn, he has yet to provide any clues to the information we all desperately crave—what the hell is going on?
Four days after the attack, there is a woeful paucity of divulgences regarding what actually happened at the finish line. Part of this is only natural; the FBI does have culprits to catch after all, and the government obviously does not want to interfere with the manhunt. But Monday’s catastrophe was still a terrorist attack. One that extended its malicious tentacles across the Charles and into Harvard Square. The Cambridge Bomb Squad was ostentatiously parked outside the Harvard Square T stop on Wednesday, two days after the beastly irruption into our daily routines. For all intents and purposes, our home as been transformed into something like a warzone, a terrifying reality that has yet to be resolved or even properly acknowledged by those entrusted with the ward of our safety.  The need for leadership is all the more pressing in light of last night’s fatal shooting at MIT.
Obama’s address had passing mention of the yet unidentified antagonists. He even went so far as to mention “intimidating” and “terrorizing” as the assailants’ primary motives. But this is simply not enough.
It is understandable that the government wishes to be circumspect in its characterization of the event. After the racial profiling blunder that led to the embarrassing raid of an innocent Saudi marathoner, the government has obvious reasons to avoid making unsubstantiated claims. But as American citizens residing in what very well might have become part of the theater of operations, we have a right to know the nature of the peril in which we find ourselves. It is a testament to the government’s failure to be forthcoming that speculation, reporting, and even vigilantism have emerged on social media networks like Twitter and Reddit, the latter of which has engaged in the dangerous business of labeling random Bostonians as “suspicious.”
The reaction of these netizens is only to be expected given the legitimate frustration harbored by those of us in the Boston area. We want something. We need something. At 5 p.m. on Wednesday, excited reporters gathered outside of the federal courthouse after rumors circulated that the bomber had been captured and after being promised an official briefing on the matter. This briefing was canceled, and the courthouse was evacuated due to another bomb scare, only to be rescheduled for 8 p.m. That planned episode of disclosure was also subsequently canceled.
In an interview with Wolf Blitzer, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 complained, “there’s been a lot of chaos and a lot of misinformation floating around.” Of course there is. In fact, with no official information provided, each addition to the saga can be reasonably classified as misinformation. Yesterday afternoon, the public finally received something meaningful from the FBI—images of the two primary suspects. Yet, with this release came a government plea to its citizens for help. While obviously all available resources should be pooled together to nab the perpetrators, it is a bit discomfiting that the best our leaders can do is give us more questions to add to the tremulous surfeit of those already boiling inside us. No comfort. No explanation. No statement.
Hopefully, this situation is resolved in short time, so that Boston’s residents can develop a necessary understanding of what truly transpired. We all deserve a prudently cogitated reflection, and that is unfortunately not possible without full intelligence of the matter. For now, all we have is this spirit of civic solidarity that carefully and usefully masks the ubiquitous spirit of fear. While the president’s words yesterday were not sufficient for the occasion, they were indeed necessary. Collective grief is a surefire way to avoid ending up stalled in collective terror. But we can only contain our emotions for so long, and the state of social media is a prime indicator that such a time period is not very extensive at all. The government owes us answers, and we will continue to feverishly refresh our Facebook news feeds until that moment of revelation finally arrives. In the meantime, we’ll be forced to wait patiently with the debilitating twin feelings of uncertainty and despair.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve written recently how military technologies like drones are changing the temporal distinctions between war and peace. This past week, the trend developed even further with the recent request from the Ivory Coast that the United Nations provide drones as a way to supplement its peacekeeping force within the country.
The Ivory Coast currently has 9,500 peacekeepers operating in the country, of which 1,500 will leave in July. In return, the UN envoy of the Ivory Coast has requested the use of drones to supplement this year’s troop cuts and others currently planned for 2015.
As drones have become a more ubiquitous element of international security debates, a consistent justification for their use has emerged. They provide a cost-effective alternative to human forces that both minimizes the risk of human casualties and increases reconnaissance capabilities against enemy combatants.
France used this justification in Mali, the United States used it in Niger, and the Ivory Coast has used it now.
The argument, however, also blurs the distinctions of military involvement in a foreign conflict. For France, it simply acted as a prologue before a full French intervention into the conflict. For the United States, it remains unclear whether or not drone strikes on Islamic militants in West Africa actually occur within the jurisdiction of a war zone.
But this is what makes the argument compelling within the context of the United Nations, since peacekeepers already operate within a unique mandate. They are a military force that does not usually have the capability to actively engage an enemy in combat.
For this reason, UN peacekeeping operations have often failed. The main criticism of the UN, that it is an inanimate force without the ability to actually execute its mission and prevent mass atrocities, derives specifically from this legal paradox.
That paradox, furthermore, has directly manifested itself within the peacekeeping mission to the Ivory Coast. Despite 10 years of stabilization operations, the Ivory Coast remains a fragile state with significant security issues both internally and externally.
Last June, for example, militia attacks on a Southwestern village caused thousands to flee their homes and become internally displaced. It was only the most recent iteration of intermittent fighting that has occurred within the country for the past few years. Seven peacekeepers died in the attacks, which is only a fraction of the 107 total fatalities from the mission.
At the same time, the Ivory Coast retains porous borders in one of the most volatile regions in the world. It faces an Islamic insurgency on its northern border with Mali and a territorial dispute with neighboring Guinea that resulted in troop deployments. All of its other neighbors face similarly precarious security situations with significant levels of internal displacement and uncontrolled militant groups.
The situation may only grow more precarious following the reduction of peacekeeping forces in the next couple of years. The next national elections, which often serve as a significant catalyst for political violence, will occur in 2015. National elections in neighboring states that same year could also cause spillover effects. For the near future, then, regional security will remain volatile.
Yet, drones may actually serve as a solution to this problem. The blurred distinctions between war and peace that have distinguished recent drone operations perfectly match the blurred distinctions that define UN peacekeeping operations.
In this way, drones could actually restore some credibility to these operations. Surveillance, after all, is the drone’s biggest asset. Drones can continuously monitor an area for nearly two consecutive days. Unlike soldiers, they do not get distracted and they do not get bored.
As a result, they can fulfill one of the biggest aspects of peacekeeping operations, monitoring and surveillance, in a much more effective way than their human counterparts. Their value would only increase as election monitoring becomes a more important part of peacekeeping operations.
However, drones are only effective provided they have sufficient support from ground forces that can provide intelligence or secure an area. Peacekeeping forces can never prove effective without a significant physical presence.
These recent proposals will only prove effective, then, if drones serve as a supplement, rather than a replacement, for peacekeeping operations on the ground. If used properly, though, drones would provide a significant advantage to UN peacekeeping operations throughout the world.
Critics have rightly faulted peacekeepers for being ineffective due to their ambiguous military mandate. The ambiguous nature of drones, however, may provide the right opportunity to refute those claims. It would help to clarify the effective and proper use of drones as well as the effective and proper use of peacekeepers themselves.

Representatives from the Harvard University Health Services and Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors previewed Harvard Proof, a new alcohol education program tailored to the Harvard student that will replace AlcoholEdu this fall, during the monthly Committee on Student Life meeting Thursday morning.
Harvard Proof features current College students reenacting realistic situations encountered on a night out, and the party scenarios included in the program are set in the dorm rooms of Harvard Houses.
The system will take the place of AlcoholEdu, the online alcohol prevention program currently used by Harvard and universities across the country. Harvard Proof will launch in the fall for the Class of 2017.
Michelle Mandino, project manager and prevention specialist at Harvard’s Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and Melanie J. Comeau ’13, a DAPA representative who served as creative director for Harvard Proof, discussed the new program before a group that included College administrators, House Masters, and members of the Undergraduate Council.
They demonstrated a prototype of the program, which includes short videos and interactive activities like a pour-your-own-drink simulation that shows students the serving size of various drinks in red Solo cups.
The program stresses the existence of the College’s amnesty policy, which encourages students to bring intoxicated friends to UHS by promising no further disciplinary action.
Administrators said that because the program is specifically designed for the Harvard student, they believe it will engage incoming freshmen better than AlcoholEdu, a generic program meant to reach a broad, nation-wide audience.
“We felt strongly that a more streamlined, Harvard-specific course for students by students had the potential to positively impact incoming freshmen,” director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Ryan M. Travia wrote in a statement to The Crimson.
Travia wrote that the new interface will be more efficient, allowing students to complete their alcohol education in an hour, as opposed to the three required by AlcoholEdu.
“I think it’s supremely well done,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “It has the right mix of education and interactive activities. You can learn from the scenes and see what turn out to be good choices,”
He added that he thinks the Harvard backdrop will make the program especially effective. “The Harvard setting gives it a credibility that’s powerful,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours before a standoff with police in Watertown concluded with the death of one of the two men believed to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings, healing began in Boston on Thursday morning.
On a picture-perfect spring day in Boston’s South End, President Barack Obama joined hundreds of Bostonians and a large cast of local leaders for an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Among the guests were Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, former governors Mitt Romney, William H. Weld, and Jane M. Swift, and University President Drew G. Faust.
Before Obama took the stage to deliver widely anticipated remarks, Menino boldly stood to speak to the city he has represented for two decades, withstanding the broken leg which has recently kept him confined to a wheelchair.
“It is a good morning because we are here together,” he said. “We are Boston. No adversity, no challenge—nothing—can tear down the resilience of this city and its people.”
Patrick followed with his trademark oratory, praising the crowd for not allowing tragedy and fear to eliminate basic kindness.
“Just as we cannot permit darkness and hate to triumph over our spiritual faith, so we must not permit darkness and hate to triumph over our civic faith,” he said. “That cannot happen. And it will not.”
Obama began his remarks by thanking Menino and Patrick for leadership before reaching out to every Bostonian.
“I’m here today on behalf of the American people with a simple message,” he said. “Every one of us has been touched by this attack on your beloved city.”
He also thanked the city, saying that it had made a mark on him and countless others as a haven for new Americans and a mecca of education.
“There’s a piece of Boston in me,” he said. “You welcomed me as a young law student across the river; you welcomed Michelle, too. You welcomed me during a convention when I was still a state senator and very few people could pronounce my name right.”
Perhaps the most powerful segment of Obama’s remarks was his tribute to the three victims of the explosions. Telling the audience that the prayers of the nation were with the dead, wounded, and their relatives, the president appeared to choke up momentarily when he talked about Martin Richard, the eight-year-old from Dorchester who died after watching his father finish the race.
“We’re left with two enduring images of this little boy,” Obama said. “Forever smiling for his beloved Bruins, and forever expressing a wish he made on a blue poster board: “No more hurting people. Peace.”
Despite the tragic nature of the week’s events, though, the president would not let his speech end on a down note. As he concluded, the president gave them something to cheer about.
“When the Sox and Celtics and Patriots or Bruins are champions again—to the chagrin of New York and Chicago fans— the crowds will gather and watch a parade go down Boylston Street,” he said, sending the crowd into an immediate standing ovation marked by raucous cheers.
“And this time next year, on the third Monday in April, the world will return to this great American city to run harder than ever, and to cheer even louder, for the 118th Boston Marathon. Bet on it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 22, 2013, at 4:42 p.m.
Employees of the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, which is housed in a Harvard-owned building, filed charges of unfair labor practices on Wednesday alleging that management illegally interfered with their unionization process. The charges, filed with the National Labor Relations Board, follow a March petition by workers that announced their intention to begin the process of deciding whether or not to join UNITE HERE! Local 26, the state branch of a national union that represents more than 250,000 workers.
Brian Lang, the president of Local 26, said that hotel management had violated labor laws in three ways and that he was “very confident” the NLRB, which investigates and adjudicates labor disputes, would rule in the workers’ favor after an investigation.
First, Lang said that hotel management prohibited union organization in the hotel. Second, he said that they spied on workers engaged in union activity. Finally, he said that management cut the hours of Andrew Pattison after identifying him as a union supporter.
Pattison had led the petition effort in March, Lang said.
“He was one of the leaders,” Lang said. “It’s against the law [for hotel management] to retaliate like that.”
Pattison, who works at the hotel’s Scullers Jazz Club, said that his hours were cut from 40 per week to 10 to 15 per week two weeks after he participated in the petition delegation.
“They’ve had a couple of different excuses, but it’s clear to me and to everyone else that they did this to punish me for standing up,” he said.
Pattison said that he thought hotel management was trying to intimidate workers.
“I think they’re trying as hard as they can to really scare people, and we’re still fighting and showing them that they can’t scare us, and they can’t stop us,” Pattison said.
In an emailed statement, the hotel's General Manager Jayne Barrett responded to the claim that management was interfering with workers' unionization by writing that management does not believe that a "true majority" of the hotel's employees want to unionize.
"We respect our employees right to choose, and voting in a secret ballot election conducted by the federal government is the proper method," Barrett wrote.
Barrett’s statement did not address the alleged retaliation against Pattison or the claims of spying on union activities.
Located in Boston across the Charles River from Harvard’s main campus, the hotel has been owned by Harvard since January 2005 but is not managed by the University.
Lang said that because of Harvard’s connection to the hotel, the University has a responsibility to rectify allegedly illegal labor practices.
Harvard spokesperson Paul Andrew declined to comment on the matter, saying that the University has no hand in the hotel’s management.
Lang said that the situation at the DoubleTree is “very comparable” to the protests at the Le Meridien Hotel in Cambridge, where workers claim that management has attempted to interfere with the unionization process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates discussed compassion and altruism and how the concepts apply to everyday life Thursday evening at Gutman Library during the third event in a series of panel-style conversations called “Living Compassion.”
The event started with audience members writing down their definitions of compassion on individual notecards and later reading these out loud to the crowd.
“Compassion is caring with engagement,” said one audience member. “Caring for someone without really having a need or reason to,” said another.
Event panelists included Homicide Watch D.C. founder and Nieman Fellow Laura Amico, civil liberties activist Brian Corr, Harvard psychology professor Robert L. Selman, Harvard clinical psychiatrist Helen Riess, and moderator Elan Gepner, an activist for underprivileged schools.
Panelists began by sharing anecdotes that illustrated their personal experiences with compassion. Riess described her encounter with a child patient who adamantly believed he was a robot. She eventually learned that the child’s mother had tried to commit suicide, and the little boy responded by becoming a “robot.”
“By the end of our sessions, he sort of melted into a normal little boy, and he told me that he took out his batteries and was a little boy again,” said Riess.
After the panelists shared their stories, audience members noted that underlying similarities between each of the stories represented a fundamental essence of compassion in general.
Audience members and Gepner also asked the panelists a variety of provocative questions about the state of human compassion in today’s world.
“There’s always more that seems to demand our attention,” said Gepner. “So I’m curious, is there time for compassion, and what is the process for accessing that?”
In response, Corr discussed the impact of the Boston Marathon bombings on the community and on his work with the Cambridge Peace Commission. The response to Monday’s tragedy “provided a vehicle for compassion,” he said.
The final question of the evening concerned media and whether it facilitates or forgoes compassion. Amico said that her colleagues’ coverage of the Marathon bombings on Monday suggests that journalism can foster empathy.
“The compassion that they exhibited is awe-inspiring,” she said. “I think that Monday showed that at our best, this is who we are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student leaders criticized what some have characterized as a dangerously delayed communication from the University following Monday’s bombing at the Boston Marathon during the monthly meeting of the Harvard College Safety Committee Thursday.
Speaking before a group that included Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich and Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison, Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said students were left confused and concerned as they awaited a message from Harvard Monday afternoon.
“Undergraduates were really scared and totally lacked direction from a source they trust,” Raghuveer told The Crimson after the meeting.
After the first explosion went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon around 2:50 p.m, undergraduates received a flood of information through text, email, and social media. Harvard’s University-wide communication regarding the bombing came more than two hours later, just after 5 p.m.
Administrators acknowledged the importance of student opinion about Monday’s events.
“As Dean Hammonds signaled in her message to the College on Tuesday, we are committed to hearing what the student concerns are, and to discerning what lessons we can learn about how best to communicate during complex incidents,” wrote Kimberly A. Pacelli, Associate Dean of Student Life, in an email to The Crimson. “So to that end, today’s conversation was an important step in hearing from students about the timing and method of communication on Monday.”
Although Raghuveer’s comments focused on Harvard’s communication with College students, Patrick L. Rich, secretary of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Graduate Student Council, echoed many of her sentiments.
“It’s a shame that the University wasn’t able to step in more quickly and provide structure and guidance for students,” Rich told The Crimson.
A significant portion of Thursday’s meeting was dedicated to the topic of MessageMe, the University’s opt-in notification service that sends news alerts to members of the Harvard community via text, email, and voicemail.
At 6:20 p.m. on Monday, undergraduates subscribed to MessageMe received a communication notifying them of the cancellation of Monday evening classes. Students at the Harvard Kennedy School also received MessageMe notification at 4:57 p.m. informing them that their campus was being evacuated.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that day that the system is used in situations where there is an “imminent threat” or when the University is “asking members of the Harvard community to take a specific action in a short timeframe.”
Students at Thursday’s meeting criticized MessageMe for sending its alert hours after the first explosion.
“A lot needs to change about MessageMe,” Raghuveer told The Crimson. “Everyone recognizes in light of Monday’s events there’s certainly a lot of progress that needs to be made.”
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a UC representative and a member of the committee, said after the meeting that Harvard’s broader system for alerting students in the face of emergency needs to change.
“Communication needs to be improved. It was inefficient on Monday,” said Biebelberg. “It sounds like the administration is receptive and willing to work with us to improve communication in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most students who have taken a Harvard mathematics course have at some point used the WolframAlpha search engine or the Mathematica computation software to help solve a tough question on a problem set. On Thursday evening, several dozen of these undergraduates gathered in Science Center Hall D to see the man behind the machine—Stephen Wolfram.
In a roughly 90-minute lecture, Wolfram predicted that in the future the basic computational ideas behind his two popular mathematics tools will play an increasingly central role in all fields of study.
“There isn’t really a name yet for the field of endeavor that is about all the possible things that can be done with computation,” Wolfram said in an interview after his talk. “Everything about the world is going to end up being computational in one way or another.”
Wolfram began his talk with a discussion of the inspiration behind WolframAlpha, saying that the 17th and 18th century mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz conceived of an artificial computation engine centuries before the necessary technology was available. In this light, Wolfram said, his own WolframAlpha tool must be understood as a 21st century product of centuries of thought.
Just as Leibniz was held back by the technology of his time, Wolfram said, so too is modern society constrained by the limits of existing computational understanding.
Wolfram said that while many disciplines do not yet make full use of computational tools, advances in technology will eventually bring computation to the forefront in all aspects of society. He pointed to the Turing machine, a simple inscribing machine that, hypothetically, has the potential to compute even the most complicated algorithms, as an example of the boundless potential of computation.
For attendee Aaron D. Tucker ’16, the most interesting aspect of the talk was the focus on the increasingly complex yet unknown patterns that Turing machines can generate.
“Just the fact that you can’t figure out what you can do until you simulate it all the way out is something that I find so intriguing,” Tucker said. “I had never thought of it that way before.”
Wolfram’s lecture was hosted by the Harvard College Future Society and was followed by a dinner that allowed students to converse more casually with the WolframAlpha creator. Thursday marked the second time Wolfram has spoken at Harvard in as many months; he previously discussed the future of applied mathematics at a March 29 event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2013, at 3:50 a.m.
A massive manhunt that began with the shooting of an MIT police officer in Cambridge Thursday night and paralyzed the greater Boston community for a full day concluded Friday evening with the apprehension of the second marathon bombing suspect in a standoff in Watertown.
Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, a 19-year-old Cambridge resident, was taken into custody Friday night after police found him hiding inside a dry-docked boat in the backyard of a Watertown house. Covered in blood and possibly wounded from two standoffs with law enforcement, Tsarnaev was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in “serious condition,” Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis said.
Tsarnaev’s 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was fatally shot in a firefight with police in Watertown early Friday morning. Along with his brother, he is suspected to have been a perpetrator of Monday’s bombings at the Boston Marathon, which killed three and injured more than 170. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a part of the Friday morning skirmish as well but evaded capture by the combined forces of municipal, state, and federal law enforcement for much of the day Friday.
With Tsarnaev at large until the FBI finally captured him at 8:45 p.m. Friday, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 ordered much of the greater Boston area to stay indoors and close businesses for the day. With the MBTA closed at the governor’s request and police forces forbidding all traffic into or out of Watertown, the combined police forces launched a door-to-door search of a 20-block section of Watertown, where the younger Tsarnaev was believed to be hiding. The Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad was also deployed early Friday to search the area for any explosive devices, the Cambridge Police Department wrote in a statement early Friday.
After a day of futile searching, the governor lifted the city-wide lockdown shortly after 6 p.m., and for the first time all day, Watertown residents trickled outside of their homes and offices and into the streets.
Less than an hour after the ban was lifted and the chances of a quick capture seemed to have passed, a Watertown resident walked into his backyard and noticed blood on the cover of his boat, which was dry-docked there. Upon lifting the tarp from the top of the boat, the resident saw a man coated in blood sitting inside the boat, said Davis.
The Watertown resident returned inside and called law enforcement authorities, who rapidly mobilized and arrived at his house. According to Davis, the scene was located outside the perimeter of the door-to-door searches conducted earlier in the day.
Heavily armed forces, along with a heat-sensing State Police helicopter hovering overhead, surrounded the boat. The approach was cautious due to the risk that Tsarnaev, who was still shrouded by the boat’s tarp, had strapped deadly explosives to his body. After nearly an hour of gunfire and “flash bang” stun grenades used to disorient Tsarnaev, an FBI hostage rescue team closed in on the teenage suspect.
U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said Tsarnaev was not read the customary Miranda Rights, which inform suspects of their civil liberties with respect to questioning and are normally required reading before interrogation. But when a suspect is deemed to pose an immediate threat to law enforcement officers or the general public, police can invoke the “public safety” exception—the only exception to the Miranda rule—and engage in interrogation of the suspect without reading the Miranda Rights.
News of Tsarnaev’s capture spread quickly over television and Twitter, offering Bostonians who had spent much of the week in fear a chance to breathe a sigh of relief and celebrate law enforcement’s victory over the alleged terrorists. In Watertown, just blocks from the final shootout, residents lined the streets and chanted, “USA! USA!” as emergency vehicles and state troopers exited the area. Residents from across the greater Boston area gathered on the Boston Common late Friday night, where just days before they had come together to mourn the victims of the marathon bombings.
At a press conference at 9:30 p.m. Friday, nearly 24 hours after the manhunt began, law enforcement officials from the FBI, the cities of Boston and Watertown, and the Massachusetts State Police stood beside politicians and public servants to celebrate the successful capture of the younger Tsarnaev.
“We are eternally grateful for the outcome here tonight. We have a suspect in custody,” Alben said. “We’re so grateful to bring justice and closure to this case.”
But officials stressed that the capture is just the beginning of the broader investigation into how and why the suspects were driven to terrorism. Ortiz said that her office will begin the difficult process of reconstructing the case and eventually prosecuting the surviving suspect.
Addressing the nation Friday night, President Barack Obama cautioned against jumping to conclusions or judgments about the case before all the details are worked out. Still, he said, Friday night’s capture and arrest marked the end of a sad chapter for Boston.
“Whatever hateful agenda drove these young men to such heinous acts will not prevail,” Obama said. “Whatever they thought they could ultimately achieve, ultimately failed.”
Though the pursuit of the bombers began almost immediately after Monday’s bombings, it was not until the seemingly random murder of an MIT police officer Thursday night that law enforcement officials advanced the case, suid Massachusetts State Police Colonel Timothy P. Alben in an impromptu press conference convened shortly before 4:30 a.m. Friday and again at Friday night’s conference after Tsarnaev’s capture.
In a statement released early Friday morning, the Cambridge Police Department wrote that they first received a report around 10:20 p.m. Thursday that shots had been fired on the MIT campus. When they arrived on the scene at 10:30 p.m., CPD found an MIT officer, in his car, with multiple gunshot wounds. That officer, identified as 26-year-old Sean Collier, was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival, according to the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office.
Cambridge police also received reports of an armed robbery at a 7-Eleven in Central Square at 10:30 p.m. Though that incident was initially thought to be related to the murder, Alben said Friday that law enforcement had determined the two were unrelated, but that the bombing suspects were in the store at roughly the time of the robbery.
Shortly thereafter, they said, an armed hijacking occurred around Third Street in Cambridge, when two male suspects held the owner of the car, a Mercedes SUV, at gunpoint. The car owner was released roughly half an hour later at a gas station off Memorial Drive.
When the stolen Mercedes was spotted in Watertown by police in that area, Alben said, a mass chase ensued as CPD, Massachusetts State Police, and the FBI joined the effort. It ultimately resulted in a firefight between law enforcement and the two suspects, who threw improvised explosive devices and homemade grenades and traded some 200 rounds of gun shots with law enforcement, Davis said.
“This is the stuff that in an urban police department, it’s almost unheard of,” Davis said Friday night after Tsarnaev’s capture.
In his haste to escape police, Tsarnaev drove over his older brother’s body, which was bound with explosives, law enforcement officials said.
In addition to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and the MIT police officer, one MBTA Transit Police officer was shot in the gunfire exchange en route to Watertown Thursday night. That officer is in stable condition, MBTA officials said Friday.
Alben identified Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as the same man suspected of helping to carry out Monday’s bombing and seen wearing a white hat in surveillance video from the marathon. Officials believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the same man seen wearing a black hat and sunglasses in other surveillance video.
The Tsarnaev brothers immigrated to the United States a decade ago from Chechnya and lived in central Cambridge. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and worked part-time as a lifeguard at Harvard’s Malkin Athletic Center, former classmates said Friday.
In response to the ongoing search for the alleged terrorist, the University closed all operations on Friday, advising students to stay inside as much as possible.

CORRECTION: April 22, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis as describing the capture of the marathon bombing suspect as something “that an urban police department has never heard of.” In fact, Davis described the manhunt as something “that in an urban police department, it’s almost unheard of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a fatal shooting at MIT and the ensuing police chase created a sense of chaos in and around Cambridge, students said that infrequent communications from University administration left them worried and in the dark as a frightening situation developed nearby.
The Cambridge Police Department received a call about shots being fired on MIT’s campus around 10:20 p.m. Thursday night. MIT’s alert system issued its first bulletin outlining the developing situation at 10:48 p.m., with 10 more to follow informing students that police were investigating the shooting and telling them to stay indoors. MessageMe—Harvard’s opt-in emergency alert system—sent its first message to students at 11:33 p.m., and as of press time had sent seven more over the next five hours.
Meanwhile, through various news outlets, Twitter, House and club lists, and even police scanners, students followed a turbulent series of events—a manhunt for two men who robbed a convenience store, killed an MIT police officer, hijacked a Mercedes SUV, and led authorities on a chase into Watertown.
At 5 a.m., Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote in an email to students that “the campus remains on high alert” as a precaution due to the manhunt in nearby Watertown.
“The events of this week—from the tragic Boston Marathon bombings to the shootings and police activity at MIT and Watertown overnight—have understandably created a great deal of anxiety throughout our community,” Hammonds wrote. “At this time, and in light of the most recent information about an armed and dangerous suspect in Watertown, we ask that everyone remain alert and avoid the Watertown area.”
Several hours before Hammonds sent her email, Undergraduate Council president Tara Raghuveer ‘14 said that she was “extraordinarily disappointed” that the University had not communicated with students sooner and more frequently about the events in East Cambridge and in Watertown.
“We went for a whole hour without hearing anything,” Raghuveer said. “I find it really unsettling as a student, and find it really uncomfortable as a student leader, because I think people are looking to me as a source of information.”
She said she thinks it is the duty of Harvard’s administration to reassure students and instruct them on how to stay safe, especially during a situation like Thursday evening’s when an influx of information from social media and email made it difficult to discern which sources were credible.
“I think this type of circumstance is prone to causing panic,” she said.
Her criticism of the administration came just days after students raised similar criticisms over the slow pace of the University’s communication with students following the bombing at the Boston Marathon Monday.
At 2:10 a.m., Raghuveer emailed students from the UC President’s account advising them to “stay inside, stay calm, and check on friends to make sure they are doing the same.”
House administrators took to their emails to offer their own advice to their students in the midst of the confusion.
Resident deans and House Masters from Pforzheimer, Cabot, Leverett, Lowell, Winthrop, and Eliot Houses emailed residents asking them to stay inside and remain alert.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement that Harvard had been closely monitoring the situation throughout the night.
“College and University officials have been in close contact with Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) since the shooting at MIT was reported late Thursday evening. HUPD was similarly in close contact with police at MIT and with the Cambridge Police Department,” Neal wrote. “At no time was a threat to Harvard’s campus identified. However, HUPD maintained a heightened security presence on campus as a precautionary measure.”
Inside the Science Center, around 50 computer science students chose to remain in the basement for several hours early this morning after learning about the shootout from social media and news outlets.
“I advised everyone in this room not to move,” said Anna V. Gommerstadt ‘13, a student teaching fellow for a computer science course that was holding office hours for her students in the Science Center basement when the news broke.
Gommerstadt chose to call HUPD when she heard about the shooting at MIT to ask if it was safe for her students to walk home.
“I wanted some concrete information,” she said.
Gommerstadt, who said she was told by the officer on the other end of the call to make a “judgement call” about whether or not it was safe to cross campus, expressed frustration at the lack of immediate communication from University alert systems.
“I’m a little confused as to why alerts from MessageMe have been rather infrequent, why [information] comes from students and not the administration,” she said.
Computer science student Jordan Dominguez ’15 said that when official alerts proved insufficient, students holed up in the Science Center basement relied on posts on from Reddit an online broadcast of the Cambridge Police Department scanner for information.
“I think it’s ridiculous,” she said of the frequency and nature of University communications. “We weren’t even told to stay indoors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University will be closed Friday due to public safety concerns prompted by an at-large gunman suspected of playing a role in Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings.
The University has also canceled shuttle services and all athletic events and practices, indefinitely. The status of Visitas, scheduled for this weekend, is unclear. A University spokesperson declined to comment early Friday on the status of prefrosh weekend.
Harvard’s closure comes as much of west Boston and the near suburbs lock down in the wake of Thursday night’s standoff. In a press conference early Friday morning, Mass. Emergency Management Agency Director Kurt Schwartz said that people who live in Watertown, Waltham, Newton, Belmont, Cambridge, and the Boston neighborhood of Allston-Brighton should stay home. He also said that businesses in those areas should remain closed.
The gunman was last seen in East Watertown, where he was involved in a firefight with municipal, state, and federal law enforcement officials.
“We are asking you to stay indoors, to stay in your homes for the time being,” Schwartz said. “We are asking business in those areas to cooperate and not open today until we can provide further guidance.’’
In addition, Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick '78 ordered the closure of all public transportation early Friday, including MBTA trains and buses and all commuter rail lines. Amtrak service has also been temporarily suspended between Boston and Providence, R.I.
The at-large gunman is believed to be connected to the bombing of the Boston Marathon on Monday and the killing of an MIT police officer late Thursday night.
“This is a very serious situation that we are dealing with,” Mass. State Police Colonel Timothy P. Alben said at the press conference.
MIT, Boston College, Boston University, Emerson College, Suffolk University, and Boston Public Schools are among a number of schools closed Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 19, 2013, at 4:21 p.m.
 
With greater Boston on lockdown as law enforcement officers hunt down the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, Harvard has canceled programming for Visitas weekend.
Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote in an email to students at about 1:40 p.m. on Friday that "organizers are working with impacted students and their families.” He reiterated that there continues to be no known threat to Harvard’s campus.
Still, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email Friday afternoon that the College will not reschedule the annual weekend for admitted prospective students.
Prior to canceling the event, Harvard had closed registration for Visitas weekend Friday morning. In an email sent to all admitted students Friday morning, the College advised admitted freshmen who have not yet left for Cambridge to stay put until they receive further direction.
Citing the continued closure of the MBTA and other forms of transportation throughout Boston, the Friday morning email stressed that any students in transit for Visitas should stay where they are and wait for further instruction from the University. The email warned that transportation in Cambridge and Boston is currently impossible and should not be attempted.
Neal reiterated that concern Friday afternoon.
“Students already in transit should, if practicable, return home,” Neal wrote. “We will work directly with individual students who have arrived in the Boston area, or who will soon be arriving, to determine their best course of action.”
Neal said Harvard has worked with Massport to arrange a meeting place for all Visitas attendees in Terminal E of Boston Logan International Airport. Massport has posted signage directing all arriving students to that point, where they are being greeted and redirected by Assistant Dean for Administration Noah S. Selsby ’94, Neal wrote. All admitted students will receive an email alerting them to the arrangement, he added.
That announcement comes as the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, remains armed and at large likely in the greater Boston area. Tsarnaev was last seen early Friday morning in East Watertown after a standoff with police. Law enforcement officials have surrounded what is thought to be Tsarnaev’s home in central Cambridge.
Harvard, like many other local universities and school systems, is closed for the day, and authorities have asked individuals to stay home and businesses to remain closed in Cambridge and several other Boston suburbs and neighborhoods.
“We regret this inconvenience and share your disappointment that Visitas has been disrupted.  But your safety and the safety of the public is of the utmost importance to us,” the College’s early Friday email to all admitted students read. “We will be back in touch as soon as we have more information about when it is again appropriate to attempt to travel to Harvard.”
Early Friday morning, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 ordered the MBTA to halt service on all buses and trains. Amtrak announced early Friday that it would halt service between Providence, R.I., and Boston and Friday afternoon that it had extended that suspension through New York City. Bus companies Greyhound, Megabus and BoltBus all suspended service in and out of Boston mid-morning. As of around 8 a.m., Boston Logan International Airport expected to stay open. All taxi service within the city of Boston was suspended Friday morning, but was reinstated hours later.
An announcement posted at 6:49 a.m. on the Harvard College Office of Admissions website says that University administrators have been in close contact with Harvard University Police Department since Thursday evening. It added that the University will remain on “high alert until the situation is resolved.”
“Student safety is our foremost priority and we will do everything necessary to safeguard students and other community members,” the announcement reads.
Current Harvard students who were planning to host visiting admitted students were also notified of the change in plans.
Each spring, Visitas typically draws more than 1,000 prospective freshmen, most of them high school seniors, for a weekend of welcome events and various forms of introduction to Harvard College’s academic and social life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2013, at 4:38 a.m.
In this space, The Crimson will provide updates on the situation at Harvard as the manhunt in the greater Boston metropolitan area progresses. To share information, please email news@thecrimson.com.
4:38 a.m., 4/20/13 The Crimson has captured video from the Boston Common, where local residents gathered to celebrate the capture of Boston marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev.
3:46 a.m. 4/20/13 The manhunt for Cambridge resident Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev left the greater Boston area in a state of lockdown and spanned about a seven-mile area from Cambridge to Watertown. The Crimson has compiled an interactive map outlining important locations from the chase.
12:29 a.m., 4/20/13 The Boston area and state officials celebrated following the arrest of a suspect in Monday's Boston Marathon Bombings. Crimson photographers were on the scene taking photographs around Boston.

Our reporters on the scene say that foot and vehicular traffic has picked up and stores have reopened. At least for now, there are no organized celebrations outside.
9:39 p.m., 4/19/13 Our reporters are on the scene at the Arsenal Mall press conference. Follow @npfandos for live coverage.
9:37 p.m., 4/19/13 Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an email to the College around 9:20 p.m., acknowledging that the previous day's manhunt that ended in the apprehension of a Boston Marathon bombings suspect had "been a long and difficult ordeal for our community."
In the email, she listed the various mental health services available on campus, encouraging students to reach out to their House administrators and utilize the resources at Harvard University Health Services in the coming days.
9:17 p.m., 4/19/13 University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds stopped into Annenberg Hall during Friday's dinner hour to talk with undergraduates who had been kept inside most of the day because of an active manhunt for a suspected Boston marathon bomber. Provost Alan M. Garber '76 stopped by each of the Quad houses, as well, talking with students there.
9:05 p.m., 4/19/13 Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67 told The Crimson Friday night that officials are considering the possibility of granting an extension for accepted students to accept or decline their offers of admission to the College. Admitted students currently have until May 1 to reply.
Fitzsimmons said the Admissions Office will "monitor the situation as we go along," adding that there may be "some specific situations where students will need more information from either students or faculty as we go along."
Fitzsimmons also said "it's absolutely impossible to know" if the cancellation of Visitas, the annual admitted students visiting weekend, will have an impact on the Class of 2017's yield. "This is an unprecedented event," Fitzsimmons said, "and it's very difficult to know how it might go."
7:43 p.m., 4/19/13 As reports come in from Watertown, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an email to students at approximately 7:30 p.m.  urging them to remain vigilant.
"While you should feel free to resume your normal movements around campus we would still recommend curtailing off-campus activities for tonight," Hammonds wrote.
In her message, Hammonds also provided updates on campus services, saying that FAS buildings would immediately return to normal operations, shuttle service would resume as of 7:30 p.m., and HUDS would resume regular operations on Saturday.
7:17 p.m., 4/19/13 Harvard MessageMe alert issued at 7:09 p.m. reports gunfire in Watertown and urges students to stay away from the area.
6:47 p.m., 4/19/13 Harvard Shuttle service will resume as the state of Massachusetts drops its stay indoors order, a Harvard alert timestamped 6:35 p.m. reads. The alert also urges Harvard community members to remain vigilant as the University’s Cambridge campus remains under heightened security.
 
 
6:45 p.m., 4/19/13 In an email sent at roughly 6:30 p.m., Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer '14 told Harvard deans that students "are looking for instruction" on how to proceed following the lift on the lockdown. The email was sent to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, Associate Dean of Student Life Kimberly A. Pacelli, and John “Jay” L. Ellison, who manages campus security in his capacity as associate dean of the College. The UC general list was also copied on Raghuveer's message. In her email, Raghuveer called on administrators to give students answers to the questions: "Is Harvard still locked down? Where should we stay? What is the most reliable source information right now?"
6:18 p.m., 4/19/13 MBTA is now open in Boston, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 says during press conference. Patrick says order for Boston residents to stay inside is lifted, but encourages everyone to stay vigilant.
5:28 p.m., 4/19/13 After initially criticizing the frequency of Harvard's communications to students regarding public safety in the Cambridge area, Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer '14 said on Friday that updates from the administration have “drastically improved since last night.”
She said emails from Harvard administrators have become “more substantive and more frank” as the manhunt in greater Boston that began Thursday night drags on into Friday evening.
“Students are happy to see that,” Raghuveer told The Crimson.
4:59 p.m., 4/19/13 Following Friday morning's news that Harvard had cancelled Visitas weekend programming, current students have begun reaching out to and answering questions from prospective students through Twitter #VirtualVisitas.
4:40 p.m., 4/19/13 All 12 House dining halls and Annenberg Hall will all be open for dinner, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote in an email to students shortly after 4 p.m. Friday. Grill service will not be available.
Harvard Hillel, Cronkhite Dining Hall, and the Dudley House dining hall will all be serving dinner as well, Hammonds wrote.
She also added that breakfast service for Saturday morning is planned as usual.
“We are grateful for your patience, your help, and your understanding as we manage services in this quickly changing environment,” Hammonds wrote. “The experience of today, though difficult, has demonstrated the kind and compassionate nature of our community. Please stay safe and support one another. We will continue to share information as it becomes available.”
4:32 p.m., 4/19/13 In an email to the Harvard community sent around 4 p.m., Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp urged students to remain inside as law enforcement continues its active manhunt for a suspected Boston Marathon bomber.
She wrote that police intend to conduct controlled explosions sometime this afternoon at the suspect’s Norfolk Street home in central Cambridge. When those explosions might occur is unknown, she added, so law enforcement have reiterated the importance for Cambridge residents to stay inside.
“We recognize it may be difficult to continue to stay indoors right now and some may be thinking about going outside after what has been a very difficult and challenging few days,” Lapp wrote. “But the events of recent days also remind us that authorities are working around the clock to find this suspect and protect public safety, and I urge you to please follow their guidance to remain inside as this manhunt continues.”
Lapp also wrote the HUPD remains on "Significantly heightened security presence.”
3:53 p.m., 4/19/13 Though Cambridge is still officially on lockdown and most area businesses remain closed at the request of Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, foot traffic in the Harvard Square area has picked up significantly as the afternoon has worn on.
Most remain inside, but small groups of Cambridge residents and Harvard affiliates are now venturing across campus and through the area. Most outside police presence has been limited to Watertown, where the at-large gunman is thought to be in hiding. The suspect’s home in central Cambridge remains under close surveillance by local, state, and federal law enforcement.
2:48 p.m., 4/19/13 Our reporters are on the scene at Norfolk Street in Cambridge, where police are investigating the home where the Boston Marathon bombing suspects recently lived. Follow @syweinstock and @JustinWorland for updates.
2:29 p.m., 4/19/13 John “Jay” L. Ellison, who manages campus security in his capacity as associate dean of the College, has sent an email to undergraduates announcing that "Harvard College has cancelled Visitas programming this weekend and organizers are working with impacted students and their families."

An earlier version of this article misquoted Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67 as saying prospective freshmen may need more information "from either students and faculty" in the coming days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Greater Boston came to a standstill Friday morning during the manhunt for marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, Harvard students sat anxiously in spaces across campus, glued to television screens as they waited news of developments.
“People have been really good about banding together and providing information, and I think the administration is doing the best it can,” said Angela S. Berkowitz ’15, who was sitting in a common room in Ridgley Hall swing space with around 10 other students, watching news coverage of the manhunt.
“It’s obviously frightening,” she added.
Florence Y. Chen ’15, who was also in Ridgely watching the news, said that the violence in Cambridge last night and subsequent manhunt prompted significant anxiety for her and her friends.
“Your nerves are slowly being worn,” Chen said. “You're on edge, and you don't know how much more you can take."
The Harvard campus stood silent Friday morning, as classes, athletics, and organizations like the Institute of Politics canceled all planned activities in line with the University's closing.
A 10:30 a.m. email from Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 said that Annenberg Hall and all House dining halls would serve lunch, but that they would use disposable plates and utensils and there would be no grill service. Dingman also wrote that Harvard University Dining Services had set up “limited food service” in Lamont Library, where students remained stranded throughout the night.
“The Harvard University Police Department continues to remain comfortable with modest and quick travel for meals, but advises all students to avoid being outdoors otherwise,” Dingman wrote.
In an effort to pass the time while students were stuck indoors, some College administrators organized small gatherings within the Houses.
In Adams Dining Hall,  tables were dotted with board games such as Risk and Apples to Apples. And in the Quad, Cabot House resident dean Emily W. Stokes-Rees sent an email to Cabot residents inviting them to the dining hall for board games, arts and crafts, and other activities.
“We are here to hang out and pass the time, to be together, and also to talk to you about any concerns you might have about everything that has been going on this week,” Stokes-Rees wrote. “We are here to listen and to support, so please chat to us and don’t be alone.”
Students said the mood on campus had been tense for hours.
Winthrop House resident Jeffrey A. Mulligan ’14 said that during the night, he had heard sirens outside, listened to a police scanner, and remained inside his dorm room as he monitored the developments around the metropolitan area.
“It just looked nuts outside,” Mulligan said. “It’s still kind of frightening.”
Another Winthrop resident, Tim J. Barry-Heffernan ’14, said that he and friends were glued to a police scanner until around 5 a.m. Friday morning.
Thayer resident Achim Harzheim ’16, who was watching the news in Thayer basement with other residents of the freshman dorm on Friday morning, said that his heavyweight crew team was scheduled to travel to Princeton this morning, but that the trip had been put off because of the lockdown. Still, Harzheim said that he was “not that concerned,” since events seemed to be unfolding other parts of the greater Boston area.
On at least one of Thayer’s doors, a handwritten sign repeated the warning that several emails had expressed to students throughout the morning.
“University closed today,” the sign said. “Bombing suspect is at large. Police are asking people to stay inside.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 20, 2013, at 5:44 a.m.
While on breaks from his shifts as a lifeguard at the Malkin Athletic Center pool, Chris Finlay rarely chatted with his lanky teenaged coworker about anything other than pool operations.
But one day, Finlay decided to break the ice. He asked his fellow lifeguard, a Chechnyan ethnic who had emigrated to the United States from Kyrgyzstan a decade before, what he thought about the notoriously toxic relations between Russians and Chechnyans.
On this topic, the usually shy high schooler was outspoken.
“He spoke with a bit of a hatred toward Russia,” Finlay recalled of their conversation. “There was certainly some anger in him.”
There is no evidence to suggest that Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, the captured suspect that police believe to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings, may have been motivated in any way by Chechnyan political considerations for his alleged attack. But Finlay reflects on the conversation now as a hint that his former coworker’s broader outlook may have been troubled.
Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, is believed today to be a terrorist, but just months ago he was a lifeguard working at a Harvard pool and a high school senior attending the public school Cambridge Rindge and Latin, just blocks from Harvard.
On Friday, as police lights flashed through their shuttered windows, Tsarnaev’s former coworkers and classmates were left to ponder an unsettling question: how could they reconcile the soft-spoken teenager they had known with the suspected terrorist whose flight left the greater Boston area in a state of fear-ridden lockdown for a full day?
‘REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL KID’
Tsarnaev is suspected to have planted one of the two bombs that killed three people and injured 176 at the Boston Marathon Monday. The search for Tsarnaev and his brother, the other man identified Thursday as a suspect in the bombing, developed into a police chase across Cambridge and Watertown late Thursday night that left an MIT policeman dead and a transit officer wounded. Local authorities did not capture Tsarnaev until late Friday evening, leaving millions of Boston residents cooped up in their homes while police scoured the streets throughout the day.
But during their lifeguarding days, Finlay did not think that Tsarnaev’s words about Russia suggested an unusually violent or dangerous broader outlook. Finlay wrote them off to his coworker’s youth and what he presumed had been a difficult childhood for Tsarnaev as a young immigrant.
He was also reassured by the fact that when he asked Tsarnaev about his feelings on the U.S., he received a much less disconcerting answer.
“I don’t recall him saying that he loved it, but he certainly didn’t say that he hated it,” said Finlay, who added that the Tsarnaev seemed “indifferent” to but not “disgruntled” with America.
Mostly, Finlay said, Tsarnaev behaved like a typical Cambridge teen. During high school Tsarnaev was employed by the University, working intermittently as a lifeguard as recently as the summer of 2012, a Harvard official told The Crimson.
“He seemed like a regular high school kid, just trying make a buck after class,” Finlay said. “He sat in the chair, guarded people, did his job.”
Several of Tsarnaev’s high school acquaintances said he often talked about the things that occupy the minds of many high school seniors, especially college. Paige C. Newell ’14, who lifeguarded with Tsarnaev, remembered chatting with him about his plans to pursue higher education.
After graduation, Tsarnaev enrolled at University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, though it is unclear how long he was there.
‘A VERY GOOD IMPRESSION’
Other acquaintances said Tsarnaev was not only an apparently normal teenager, but also a personable and talented peer.
“He was pretty much a friend to everyone, because he was so down to earth and friendly,” said Conor R. Paterson ’16, one of Tsarnaev’s former classmates at Cambridge Rindge and Latin.
Classmates from high school remembered him as a shy but normal teenager who went by the nickname “Jahar” and excelled at athletics. All five former classmates interviewed by The Crimson said the person they went to school with was nothing like the “white hat suspect” that the FBI identified on a surveillance video walking away from the blast-zone at the marathon.
Paterson said he saw Tsarnaev as recently as November 2012, when the two acquaintances played pick-up basketball at a local park. Paterson said that although Tsarnaev had told him he had recently dropped out of University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, at the time, he appeared to be doing well. He was the “same old Jahar,” Paterson said.
Several other Harvard lifeguards told The Crimson that Tsarnaev had always been an easygoing and agreeable colleague.
“Honestly, he made a very good impression on me,” said Inanna L. Carter ’14, who worked with Tsarnaev last summer when she began lifeguarding at the MAC.
Carter described him as an entertaining and engaging coworker, who “showed her the ropes” and played jokes on pool patrons “just to keep his job interesting.” She added that she enjoyed lifeguarding with Tsarnaev so much that she asked to continue working with him in the future.
“He definitely made an impression,” she said. “That impression was: very mature and very intelligent for his age.”
Another fellow lifeguard, Agustin Castile, recalled the young man’s intelligence and his “contemplative” bent.
“He had a good vocabulary, and he was inquisitive,” said Castile, a sophomore at Clarke College who graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin a year before Tsarnaev, and worked alongside him at the MAC pool.
And though he had aspirations for higher education, Tsarnaev was hardly a nerd or a lonely academic, according to Castile.
“He was an athletic kid, handsome, he didn’t have any trouble fitting into social groups,” he said.
Still, Castile took note of some of Tsarnaev’s more strident traits.
“He came off to me as a normal kid, but he definitely had a sharp sort of attitude,” said Castile. “He had strong opinions.”
‘WOULDN’T HAVE PICKED HIM’
Acquaintances struggled to reconcile their positive perceptions of Tsarnaev with the news that he is the suspected perpetrator of a terrorist attack.
Paterson, who played basketball with Tsarnaev just months ago, said he thought nothing about Tsarnaev’s conduct or demeanor in that game hinted that he might be capable of violent acts.
“I had never even seen him be rude to someone else,” he said.
Even Tsarnaev’s apparent commitment to religious and political causes came as a shock to many of his peers. According to multiple news outlets, Tsarnaev articulated his views about Islam and Chechnyan independence on several English and Russian social media sites.
Hannah S. Firestone ’16, who attended both elementary and high school with Tsaernaev, said the two were briefly members of the same gymnastics program at Cambridge Rindge and Latin. She remembered him as a “really nice, quiet guy,” and noted that he had seemed anything but dogmatic.
“I was never under the impression that he was particularly religious,” she said.
Paterson said that to his knowledge Tsarnaev identified as Muslim, but was not traditionally observant.
“He had always been Muslim, but he drank and smoked,” Paterson said.
Even Finlay, the lifeguard whom Tsarnaev spoke to about his hatred of Russia, said that the news that Tsarnaev was a suspect in the bombing came as a complete surprise.
“I really wouldn’t have called this one,” Finlay added.
Classmates less well-acquainted with Tsarnaev agreed that he seemed like a typical, non-descript high school student in a graduating class of around 400. Becca J. Mazur ‘15 remembered him from the Advanced Placement English Language and Composition class they both took as a “friendly, quiet” sort of student.
“He didn’t seem culturally at odds with anything,” said Mazur, who is also a Crimson arts editor.
Mazur said that if she had to choose one person from that class that would end up a suspected person in a bombing case, she “wouldn’t have picked him.”

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev had grown up in Chechnya before emigrating to the United States. In fact, while he is an ethnic Chechnyan, Tsarnaev moved from Kyrgyzstan to America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team may have won 11 straight matches and may have a 4-0 record in Ivy League play, but its path to a second consecutive Ancient Eight crown is far from assured, and it will take on two more conference foes this weekend.
The Crimson’s road to another title and possible NCAA tournament berth continues this weekend, when it will play its final home match of the season against Brown (12-9, 1-3 Ivy) on Friday and then travel to New Haven to face rival Yale (16-5, 2-2 Ivy) on Sunday.
Harvard (16-4, 4-0 Ivy) enters the matches ranked 22nd in the country after defeating conference foes Princeton and Penn on the road last weekend, but it is not reading too much into its winning momentum, according to head coach Dave Fish.
“We’re only four-sevenths of the way [through the Ivy League season],” he said. “We’re not looking at things and saying that we have great momentum. We’re taking the attitude that everybody will be coming after us, so we’ve got to go after them.”
The Crimson has not only historically dominated the Bears, owning a 75-7 all-time record, but has also held the upper hand in recent tilts. Harvard has won eight of the past nine matches it has played against Brown, including two last season.
The Bears won their Ivy opener against Penn, but have since lost three straight to fall to a tie for sixth place in the Ancient Eight. But their three losses were to Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell, all of whom are ranked 51st or better nationally. The past two defeats also came on the road.
Brown junior Sam Fife has played well lately at fourth singles, winning two of his three Ivy matches, but he will contend with Crimson senior co-captain Andy Nguyen, who has been dominant at the fourth slot with a 12-2 record.
Sophomore Daniel Hirschberg has also anchored the bottom of the lineup for the Bears. Playing in the fifth and sixth spots, he has won each of his four singles matches in conference play.
“The bottom of the Brown lineup is really tough,” Fish said. “The top of our lineup has been doing pretty well in league play, but their lineup is stacked toward the middle and bottom. So we have to try to take some matches, and we’ll take them wherever we can.”
The No. 57 Bulldogs will present their own challenges, even though the Crimson has already beaten Yale this season. Harvard defeated its rival, 4-2, in February at the ECAC Division I Indoor Team Championships in Ithaca, but the squad must now travel to the Bulldogs’ home courts.
“It definitely doesn’t hurt that we played them,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “They have some very talented players at the top of their lineup. Harvard-Yale is always a lot of fun, so we’re excited and we’ll fight as hard as we can.”
The Bulldogs currently sit at fourth in the Ivy League, but jumped eight spots in the national rankings after an impressive win over No. 51 Cornell last weekend. Their No. 1 singles player, senior John Huang, has won his last three matches, and No. 2 Marc Powers and No. 4 Martin Svenning are both undefeated in home singles matches this year.
The Crimson’s biggest advantage this weekend may come in doubles play, where it has been rolling. It has taken the doubles point in each of its last 11 matches, and its top tandem of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster is ranked 52nd in the nation. All three of the team’s regular pairs have winning records in dual play this season.
Despite Harvard’s winning ways this season, it is more focused on day-to-day improvement than the ultimate goal of winning the Ivy League.
“It’s easy to start thinking about Ivy titles, but we really need to concentrate on basics,” Fish said. “Can we move our feet to the next ball? If we execute repeatedly for a whole day, that’s when our efforts will pay off.”
And even if the Crimson is able to complete the home-road sweep this weekend to improve its conference play record to 6-0, its focus will still not change.
“You have to treat all matches with the same intensity,” Fish said. “If, in any given match, we bring five percent less than our best, that’s a 5-2 win for the other team. There’s no breathing room, because everybody wants to knock you off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tied with Dartmouth for first place in the North Division, the Harvard softball team took a break from conference play on Thursday, extending its winning streak to eight with two victories over Quinnipiac.
The Crimson (18-17, 8-4 Ivy) played a close first game with the Bobcats (14-26, 7-3 NEC) until a five-run sixth put Harvard up, 9-4. In the second game, the Crimson made quick work of Quinnipiac, winning, 11-6, in five innings.
Harvard took advantage of the Bobcats’ struggling starting pitching, working the count and coming up with timely walks and hits. Junior co-captain Shelbi Olson was an offensive sparkplug for the Crimson, going 2-for-3 in both games with a walk and three RBI.
“I thought we were really selective, and it helped that their pitchers having a hard time finding their zone,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We have been focusing on going deep in the count and having consecutive good at bats in the lineup. We executed and the runs came.”
The Crimson, which now holds an overall winning record for the season, capped off a 12 game home stand before taking to the road to close out its conference season with eight Ivy League games—including four against the Big Green.
“We’re feeling really confident with where we are,” said junior third baseman Kasey Lange. “We’re not taking anything for granted, but we’re definitely looking to carry this momentum into the weekend.”
HARVARD 11, QUINNIPIAC 6
Though freshman starting pitcher Jamie Halula struggled with her control in the opening innings of the game, the Crimson was able to isolate the Bobcats on the base paths and contain its mistakes.
“Jamie was trying to overthrow at first,” Allard said. “She’s not a power pitcher; she’s a finesse pitcher. She was trying to power past hitters, and her pitches weren’t breaking, so she was getting hit.”
Quinnipiac scored the first run on back-to-back doubles in the first, but Harvard fought back with a four-run second. After Bobcats pitcher Hannah Lindsley gave up four consecutive walks, Olson singled up the middle—just over Lindsley’s reach—driving in two.
The Crimson added four more in the bottom of the third when freshman center fielder Zoe Galindo hit a line drive into the right-center gap for a triple, driving in two runs. The Bobcats tried to limit the damage, pulling Lindsley from the mound.
But freshman pinch hitter Alyssa Siegmann had a different plan, and belted a triple of her own into left field, coming home on a fielder’s choice.
Quinnipiac would not go down quietly, taking advantage of a couple of Crimson defensive lapses to score two in the fourth. But Halula got out of the jam, forcing the final out on a pop-up to second base to end the inning and strand a runner.
“We're seeing the ball well, and we have been very poised and confident,” Allard said. “I think we can be a little sharper on the mound and on defense.”
Lange ended the game in the bottom of the fifth with a walk off double to center.
HARVARD 9, QUINNIPIAC 4
Freshman pitcher Morgan Groom made her first appearance since last Saturday, after missing Sunday’s games due to an illness. She opened the game by retiring the side to hold the Bobcats to a scoreless top of the first inning, and the Crimson took a two-run lead in the bottom of the inning.
Groom ran into trouble in the third, allowing a leadoff homerun to senior first baseman Kortney Kesses and hitting the next batter. Senior shortstop Alex Alba slapped a double to centerfield to bring home the Bobcat’s second run. Although Groom walked the following batter, she induced a long fly to Olson to end the inning.
“[Groom] was out on Sunday, so she was a little rusty, but when she got her pitches working, she was very effective,” Allard said.
Harvard added two runs of its own in the fourth, and capped off the game with a five-run sixth.
Galindo led off with a triple and scored on a throwing error by sophomore right fielder Brittney Cyr. After picking up two outs, Bobcats’ freshman pitcher Nicole Gubellini gave up a walk to Olson and a walk to Lange, bringing in junior reliever Katie Alfiere. Another walk and a triple by sophomore shortstop Emily Gusse rounded out the inning.
Quinnipiac looked to come back in the top of the seventh, scoring a run on three singles. But Harvard sophomore reliever Gabrielle Ruiz got the final outs of the game when senior center fielder Lauren Salgado lined into a double play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a strong performance against No. 18 Penn last Saturday, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team entered its Friday night matchup at No. 12/13 Princeton with a chance to solidify its place in the postseason Ivy League Tournament. The Tigers (8-4, 3-2 Ivy), however, had other plans, as they led the Crimson (6-7, 2-3) from start to finish en route to a 14-6 victory.
Princeton jumped out to a quick 3-0 lead midway through the first quarter. Harvard cut the margin to two by the end of the frame, but the Tigers took hold of the game from there.
A dominant second quarter pushed the Crimson deficit to five goals and Princeton continued to pour it on in the third period. By the end of that frame, seven unanswered goals left Harvard in what would be an insurmountable 12-3 hole.
“We came out flat,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “It was a disappointment, definitely…. We weren’t the team we have been in the last four or five games.”
The loss drops Harvard to a tie for fourth in the Ivy League. The Crimson still controls its postseason destiny, however, and can guarantee a spot in the four-team Ivy Tournament field with a win against No. 15/12 Yale next Saturday.
Junior attackman Carl Zimmerman scored two goals to lead a Harvard offense that struggled for much of the game. Freshman attackman Devin Dwyer and senior midfielder Alex White each recorded one goal and one assist for the Crimson.
Freshman midfielder Jake Froccaro led the way for the Tigers with five points, scoring three goals and assisting on two others. He was just one of three Princeton players to record hat tricks on the night, as sophomore attackman Mike MacDonald tallied four goals and sophomore midfielder Kip Orban scored three times and recorded an assist.
“You have to give credit to Princeton,” Wojcik said. “They are a very good team and they showed it [Friday].”
Harvard’s offense struggled for much of the game, seeming to take a step back from the momentum it had built in its recent strong performances.
“I think we were tight in the beginning,” Zimmerman said. “On offense we were throwing the ball away. We took some bad shots. That continued through our offensive possessions.”
The Crimson turned the ball over 17 times on the night and registered just 23 shots in contrast to the Tigers’ 45.
Harvard showed brief signs of life early in the game, scoring twice in the final 90 seconds of the first quarter. Zimmerman took a pass from freshman attackman Ian Ardey and found the back of the net just before the whistle blew to bring the Crimson within two.
But Princeton responded with a clinic over the next two periods.
Harvard was held scoreless in both frames while the Tigers continued to pad its growing lead. Froccaro, MacDonald, and Orban each scored in the second quarter to push the lead to 8-3, and the same trio combined for four goals in the third quarter, putting the game out of the Crimson’s reach with the final frame still to be played.
“Overall it was a bad team effort,” Zimmerman said. “The only good thing about this is that it’s just one game. We just need to get back to what we do best. We’d been playing well in our last few games—our offense has been clicking and our defense has been incredible. We have to get back to that.”
That mindset will be critical for Harvard moving forward. The Crimson would have locked up its spot in the Ivy League Tournament field with a win on Friday, but its fate now comes down to its regular season finale next Saturday—a home match-up with rival Yale. While a win will send Harvard into the postseason, a loss would mean the prospect of missing the tournament in consecutive seasons.
“Our backs are up against the wall,” Wojcik said. “The next week is going to show us what we’re made of as a team.”
