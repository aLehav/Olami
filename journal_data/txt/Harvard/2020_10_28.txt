After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to imagine a less romantic place than a graveyard, but that's where Marilynne Robinson sets one of the first scenes in her new novel “Jack.” Here, Robinson introduces us to the budding romance between Jack Boughton and Della Miles as they bond over a night they spend together by chance, locked in the cemetery. Jack, a self described “bum” and the white son of a Presbtyrian minister, spends most of the novel dealing with the consequences (both practical and moral) of his relationship with Della, a Black school teacher.
The novel is the fourth in a series of books by Robinson following the characters of her Pulitzer-prize winning novel “Gilead.” “Jack,” unlike the previous three books, does not take place in Gilead, Iowa (though the town and Jack’s past loom in the background). Instead, Robinson places her titular character in a 1940s St. Louis, away from his family in Iowa. While the other books give context to the upbringing of Jack Boughton, “Jack” can be read and enjoyed as a stand-alone novel.
The centerpiece of Robinson’s novel is the relationship between Jack and Della. As an interracial couple in mid-twentieth century Missouri, Jack and Della face an uncertain and fraught future. Yet, in the scenes with just the two of them, Robinson creates an intimate world that feels sheltered and hopeful. As Della remarks during their evening in the graveyard, “It just seems to me sometimes as though — if we were the only ones left after the world ended, and we made the rules — they might work just as well.” As their relationship deepens, Jack and Della do just that, making a life for themselves through stolen moments, messages inscribed in books, and flowers left on porches.
Robinson tackles the moral implication of Jack and Della’s secret life together from a heavily religious angle. Jack, especially, agonizes over the impact of his role in Della’s life. As a white man, he puts Della in a dangerous position that could damage her reputation, risk her safety, and alienate her from her community. In a particularly striking scene, Jack listens to a sermon given by a minister who seems to speak directly to him. “If you think your sins are just going to vanish away like they never happened because Jesus loves you — well, I’ve got news. Jesus loves lots of people,” Robinson writes. Robinson’s examination of the ways love can be selfish and damaging is simultaneously engaging and heartbreaking.
“Jack,” however, comes up short in its discussion of race. While Robinson dedicates a lot of space to the societal opposition to Jack and Della’s relationship, Robinson fails to truly grapple with the weight of white supremacy and a racist society. Jack appears to mostly not think about race outside of how it immediately affects him, which feels far-fetched, considering the time period the book takes place in. Jack also spends the book entering a lot of Black spaces, and, while some Black characters point out the invasive nature of Jack’s presence, he doesn’t ever have to deal with the effect of this intrusion in any meaningful way. For Jack, race is just another divide between him and Della, no different from the fact that she is an honest school teacher, and he a once-imprisoned drifter.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that the narration is told entirely through the thoughts of Jack, thereby glossing over the opinions of Black characters who have their own perspectives on race. It's hard to read this book and not come away wishing that more time had been spent in the heads of Della and her family, rather than just in Jack's endlessly neurotic brain. In general, Jack, who is haunted by a dislike of self and the kind of guilt that comes from his upbringing, is a slightly tiresome character to spend 300 pages with, and while his attempts to gain moral footing can be interesting, they often are so long-winded that the emotional pull of the story becomes diluted.
Perhaps this problem results from the book's place as the fourth in a series. Robinson has dedicated so many pages to this world and its characters, that she fails to see where the characters get in the way of the story.  “Jack” is, thus, a flawed read, yet Robinson’s beautiful prose, witty dialogue, and sharp takes on morality and love still shine through.

Taylor Johnson’s “Inheritance” is a collection of their feelings and experiences regarding gender, sex and sexuality, and race. The book is the first from the D.C. native, though some of the poems within it have appeared in places such as The Baffler, Indiana Review, Scalawag, and the Paris Review.
Succinct and poignant, Johnson’s poems rarely surpass one page. The pages are filled with extra spaces and line breaks that create a digestible, soft image for the eyes. Blank pages also frequently punctuate “Inheritance,” making readers realize how rarely they see so much of the whiteness in the pages of a book. The brevity of the content combined with all of the empty spaces on the pages makes it seem like something is being withheld from readers, as though Johnson has a secret they do not wish to share or that they know something the audience can never be privy to.
Johnson deftly switches between different styles, sometimes writing closer to traditional prose, other times connecting fragments of words, spaces, and punctuation to create looser, unstructured smatterings of text. Though Johnson’s poems vary from one to the other stylistically, they all tend to revolve around the complementary subjects of gender, race, love, sex, and sexuality.
The overall tone of “Inheritance” hovers somewhere between yearning and sadness — Johnson dreams of a commerce-less, love-filled future while lamenting the struggles they have faced in the past and continue to face in the present day. Dancing between light colloquialisms and dense formalities, Johnson captures the omnipresent dualities of their existence, whether they be racial, gendered, or otherwise. Tales of incarceration and starvation rattle readers, especially in how they so easily and naturally mingle with stories of love and holding hands on the bus that a reader can take comfort in.
Culture makes its way into “Inheritance” with references to musicians, books of the Bible, and other poets. This invites readers into their world by providing context they can relate to, allowing them to more deeply emphasize with Johnson’s point of view. Johnson pays homage to those who have inspired them and criticizes societal infrastructures and traditions that in their mind, are needless.
What sets “Inheritance” apart the most is the way it references capitalism as a part of (or rather, a rejection of) Johnson’s identity. Lines about dancing at clubs and gender passing are sprinkled with wishes of burning dollar bills and condemnations of commerce. In between descriptions of poorly lit rooms are descriptions of America’s fatal love affair with economy and private property. Capitalism is featured as prevalently in Johnson’s “Inheritance” as their Blackness and transness, and Johnson masterfully draws connections between these ideas that are often compartmentalized to show their intersectional implications. This adds dimension to the work, and forces readers to engage with questions of identity while bearing the lens of capitalism in mind. Even readers who do not identify in the same ways of Johnson will have experience with capitalist systems, thus allowing them to engage with the work more wholly.
“Inheritance” rings true because in its structures, subjects, and spirit it mimics the complexities of life — each poem works to capture life’s contradictions, reconciliations, and intersections; each choice Johnson makes is in service of this. Johnson effectively commands attention with their use of language, cultural invocations, and diction, while the length of the book and the poems within it often leave a reader wanting more.

From poverty to fame and youth to old age, João Gilberto Noll subjects readers to an illogical world, fragmented in space and time within one man’s own subconscious. The unnamed narrator awakes from the mud to lead a nonsensical life trajectory, shifting into new life conditions without explicitly announcing it to the reader. He goes from a life of poverty and homelessness to extreme wealth, indulging in a life of excess due to his success as a director. Nonetheless, throughout it all, there is an empty quality to the protagonist’s existence, which seems to contribute to his seemingly random decisions. While the structure of the novel itself does not appear to adopt a clear-cut objective, beneath the surface emerges a deeper and more implicit directive.
The protagonist shifts between varying physical and mental states, in one instance even becoming a hairy beast. This carnal experience is not fully elucidated –– as is the case with most of the narrator’s obscure ordeals –– and this animalistic and bare face of human nature consistently presents itself throughout the piece.
Moreover, Noll does not shy away from depicting various sexual behaviors. The narrator participates in a threesome and hints at a sensual relationship between him and a much younger girl, whose mother he also had relations with. There is no doubt that this character lacks moral direction, which he even acknowledges to himself. This does not, however, prevent the narrator from taking the liberty to become a priest-like authority within his homeless shelter, preaching preposterous stories to the eager elders of this home who revere his every word (until he provides them with substance they do not wish to hear). Only through these types of interactions do readers begin to grasp at Noll’s latent intentions.
Death is also commonplace, first appearing when a crippled man the narrator meets at a bar disappears under the surface of a river they spontaneously skinny dip in. The narrator decides to leave the whole instance behind, instead of alerting the authorities — this intentional carelessness appears over and over again throughout the novel. These moments are constantly juxtaposed with little snippets of true affection and selflessness, especially when the narrator encounters small children. However, the innocent nature of children is not worshipped and sought after, as is the case in other coming-of-age novels. Instead, age seems to expose the random and almost-meaningless quality of life that the narrator progressively realizes.
Poverty and wealth have little distinction. The same is true of relationships and isolation. Noll does not seem to doubt the essence of love and nurture, but rather doubts the potential for long-term devotion and its meaning. To the protagonist, the burden of life is nonsensical, especially in regards to the pursuit of achievement and success. Smaller “passions” like “strolling around the courtyard with stamina and desire” are more rewarding than his prosperous livelihood in the city of “Harmada.”
Just as the story begins with the narrator arising from the mud as he encounters a child, the novel ends with another interaction with a small boy who is deaf. As the protagonist begins to fade into the peaceful oblivion of death –– vocalizing his desire for something more –– the boy screams and shakes him back into reality.
The significance of “Harmada” seems to be one of self-interpretation, infused with several ideologies that Noll propagates. Whether life possesses meaning appears to depend on the experience of the individual, rather than being measured by one’s own achievements. Morality also manifests itself as a somewhat subjective truth in the consciousness of the protagonist, resembling an alternative mental state that “Harmada” manifests. Fact and fiction are scarcely differentiated, and it is not always explicit whether the narrator is telling the truth or not. This may serve the point that consciousness and memory are a completely illusory means of comprehending the world. However, Noll does not elaborate on whether or not there is essence behind it all –– that is for the reader to decide.
This masterpiece, although confusing to navigate at first, speaks to a whole new way of interpreting experience and subjectivity –– one recommended to those seeking a new and unconventional literary adventure.

In his literary debut, Eric M. Cervini ’14 offers a history of the American gay rights movement in which the Stonewall Riots and the AIDS epidemic –– arguably its two most widely-known events –– are mere footnotes. Instead he focuses on an unsung hero, of which the movement has nearly as many as it has martyrs. Cervini’s hero of choice is Dr. Franklin E. Kameny, a Harvard-educated astronomer fired amid the 1950s space craze for refusing to deny his homosexuality. Anyone wishing to be informed on gay life in Washington, D.C. and the seemingly endless deluge of court cases for gay rights in America should look no further. The rest should proceed with an open mind.
For a majority of readers, tedious and largely unsuccessful court cases are hardly the stuff of page-turners. Fortunately, Cervini has done very well at letting Kameny’s writings (pulled from his cache of 40,000 personal documents) speak for themselves. Though some parts are inevitably dry, the rapid pace of events ensures that a matter of interest will soon arise.
Though “The Deviant’s War” is engaging, it is also at times difficult to follow; the cast is numerous and Cervini has done his best to include as many people as possible. This is fine for establishing a wider view of gay Washington, but after some 400 pages of flitting between briefly-established side characters, the less discerning reader begins to lose track. Some characters given three pages here deserve (and sometimes have) their own biographies, among them Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, and other icons of the Stonewall legend.
Others, like the FBI informant Warren Scarberry, are given relatively little of the spotlight, yet seem to deserve more. (Scarberry killed a man. The incident is granted a few paragraphs before Cervini’s focus shifts to the 1845 New York rent protests.) Most elusive and perhaps most intriguing is Kameny’s mother, who appears for only a few lines here and there, yet is described as having “support[ed] her son and the movement until she passed away at the age of one hundred.” In a historic movement where a mother’s unwavering support seemed a rare phenomenon, Cervini’s skipping-over of Kameny’s mother is surprising and a touch disappointing.
In every historical recounting of a movement as large and varied as the gay rights movement, choices must be made about who to include, and many names must be set aside. This particular account, because it focuses on the male-dominated Mattachine Society of Washington, neglects many of the women behind the movement. Cervini is quick to address the issue directly, and makes a few attempts at remedying the imbalance. Yet nearly all the women in “The Deviant’s War” are given introductions a little too cursory for the amount of references to them. Lilli Vincenz, the first lesbian member of the MSW, is a consistent voice behind Kameny throughout the book, but we ultimately know much less about her than we do about Bob Martin, who occupies a similar status.
Cervini paints Kameny as a sort of Alexander Hamilton of the gay pride movement: essential, brilliant, but somewhat unlikeable. An obsession with a strict dress code, a tendency to be the loudest person in the room, aggression even toward his fellow activists, “rare moment[s] of contrition” –– Cervini depicts all of Kameny’s flaws along with his achievements. It is an unflinchingly honest portrait of the man, which, rather than lessening our empathy towards him, serves to heighten it.
Kameny’s beloved Mattachine Society of Washington fell apart at the end of 1971 with the birth of the Gay Activists Alliance of Washington. It is fitting that in 2011, the year he died, the MSW was revived as the New Mattachine Society of Washington D.C. (MSDC). Its manifesto promises to “ensure that the LGBTQ+ Community’s history is preserved and disseminated far and wide so that it cannot be forgotten.” With “The Deviant’s War,” Eric Cervini helps lift Frank Kameny among the unforgettables of the gay rights movement.

Nick Hornby, author of numerous film-adapted novels, produced “Just Like You” just as world politics began its tailspin into absurdity. The novel follows Lucy, a middle-aged single mother and English teacher living in London, and her unconventional relationship with Joseph, a 22 year old butcher. Their relationship begins in 2016 and is punctuated by national tensions around Brexit and hesitant conversations around race. Hornby follows their journey closely, but rather than shaping the narrative around major plot points, the book seems to be cataloguing a period in time that simply includes Lucy and Joseph’s relationship. Accordingly, their peculiar love story simply becomes a backdrop for Hornby to capture the Brexit moment in British history, and not the other way around.
Lucy and Joseph’s personal histories are plenty interesting in their own right. Lucy is in the process of divorcing Paul, her alcoholic ex and father of her two children. She meets Joseph while shopping at a local butchery he works at, hyper-aware of their inappropriate age difference and social surroundings. Joseph, nearly half her age, is an aspiring DJ living with his mother, navigating tumultuous social and romantic relationships with other twenty year-olds. Joseph begins babysitting for Lucy, and the constant proximity pushes the two together. Their relationship is clearly out of the ordinary, and with access to both their personal thoughts through third-person narration, the reader is granted insight into how truly disruptive and challenging their feelings become.
Despite the fireworks their polar-opposite backgrounds might generate, Lucy and Joseph’s relationship lacks the explosions one would expect. Hornby’s matter-of-fact delivery of events seems devoid of emotion, and when Joseph reveals himself to be unfaithful, Lucy can muster little more than silence, inquiring about the future of their relationship with a simple “And now?” Moments that deserve drama, from Paul’s angry, drunken outburst to Lucy’s confrontation with Joseph’s mother, all seem muted in favor of progressing with the story’s timeline. For a relationship that compares two different generations, two different races, and two different lifestyles, Lucy and Joseph’s journey is rather lackluster in conflict and intrigue.
Hornby is realistic if anything, and “Just Like You” articulates very clearly that relationships do not exist in a void. The Brexit referendum occurs halfway through the book, with Lucy and Joseph first encountering divisive rhetoric and thinly-veiled prejudice from both sides, and then the everyday reckoning of the decision. Discussions of race, immigration, politics, and power dominate their everyday lives, and even after the shock of Brexit has subsided, its effects seep into every interaction. Their opposing life philosophies manifest in both political sides, and Joseph’s proclamation that “young people—we’re shit at thinking about tomorrow. Smoking. Pensions. Junk food. All of it. You want to be with someone younger than you? You have to live with it” is certainly relevant. Yet while there are comparisons to be drawn between Lucy and Joseph’s relationship and the Brexit decision, the novel stops focusing on the emotions of their relationships, and starts redirecting all its energy towards exploring contemporary social conflicts.
By the end of the novel, it seems that Hornby wanted to write a realistic Brexit story, but understood the genre had been exhausted and opted to hide it under the guise of a modern love story. The narrative is certainly realistic in its ability to capture the dreary, everyday moments in Lucy and Joseph’s lives, but it also becomes a time capsule for a moment that the world is tired of hearing about. After the decision, Lucy espouses “she found herself living in a country where the BBC were sticking microphones up to the mouths of jubilant racists, opportunists, liars, and cynics, people whose unpleasantness had made them famous over these last few months, all the ambiguity had gone.” While true, this take and her many others are far from original, and for readers in 2020, seem like a tired narrative. National dread and uncertainty is well-articulated, but it comes at the cost of more specific emotional insight.
Hornby’s love story certainly has its strengths, exhibiting the rare ability to tackle both interpersonal conflict and national politics into one book. However, the lackluster and muted nature of Lucy and Joseph’s relationship through his narration of their everyday lives turns the novel into a Brexit recount rather than an examination of modern love. The book dates itself, restricting universal concepts of love and passion to the particular historical moment it occupies. Slightly unsatisfying but painfully accurate to the current state of the world, Hornby’s novel truly has readers wondering, “And now?”

For a novel whose namesake is the option of knowing the painful truth in 1999’s cult classic “The Matrix,” “Red Pill” is, above all else, about lies — both the lies told by those around us, and the lies we tell ourselves. From there, it becomes not so much a question of choosing the red or blue pill as it is an issue of distinguishing between the two at all. Set in a modern, technologically-conscious world that still comes across as vaguely foreign, Hari Kunzru’s latest work follows in the same vein of sharply crafted pseudo-realities as his earlier novels — in particular, “White Tears” and “Transmission.” Here, what “Red Pill” lacks in structural coherence, it makes up for in twisting thrill.
The story starts out simply enough: The protagonist, an uninspired writer who wakes up one morning to find himself facing the bleak horizon of middle age, receives a fellowship in Berlin, where he is meant to work on a proposed book about lyric explorations of self. There, he hopes to finally dispel the growing sense of malaise in his life, and come home to his family a new man. Yet there is a certain disquieting irony in that among all the specific places and people he mentions throughout his narration, his own name is never made known to the reader. Without it, one can’t help but feel that his search for identity, whether in a literary or personal sense, is fated to failure.
Instead of a secluded environment conducive to quiet writing, the narrator finds himself in a communal workspace where he is monitored at all times, with a “statistical breakdown of… hours spent, documents created, sites visited, and so on” distributed to him each week. Demoralized by the impersonal insincerity of this new environment, his next few weeks are spent in a limbo of self-indulgent inertia — during which he develops a fixation with a disturbing cops-gone-bad TV show called “Blue Lives” and its creator. As he is “red-pilled” by a nihilist philosophy where “the truth of existence lay in a sort of ceaseless impersonal violence, merciless and without affect of any kind,” his individual mid-life crisis becomes a window into the moral disintegration of the entire world.
Throughout all this, the deluge of obscure cultural references — ranging from outlandish political conspiracies to German romanticism — throws the reader down a disorienting spiral that not only parallels the narrator’s mind, but the current culture of Internet news, as it becomes increasingly difficult to draw the line between what is playing out on-screen and what is happening in reality. Through his depictions of actual alt-right ideologies and where they fall along the increasingly blurred line between his characters’ private and public spheres, Kunzru addresses legitimate questions regarding the toxic, immersive culture of news — in both its creation and consumption — with a wry, refreshing tone that avoids coming across as too preachy.
It is at around the halfway point, however, that “Red Pill’s” lack of a fully sympathizable (or even identifiable) narrator runs its plot slightly off course. The chapters of him stalking his one-dimensional antagonist across Europe is not so much a rabbit hole as it is an endless maze of funhouse mirrors: intriguing until it quickly becomes tiresome, without any kind of centralizing force to hold so many geographical and psychological tangents together in the reader’s mind. It isn’t quite the right build-up to the climax, which relies on a single external event rather than the untapped potential of its own plot to drive shock, leaving a sense of vague disappointment. Still, the prose remains grippingly readable, and there is a certain feverish drive that provides enough momentum to propel the reader towards the finish line.
Despite the hasty onset of the ending, it is nevertheless a redemptive moment that allows Kunzru’s language to make its final point in clean, lyrical simplicity — not quite filling those murky plot holes, but at least lulling the reader into forgetting them. “We must remember that we do not exist alone,” the narrator muses, and it is a relief that his words no longer hold a sense of paranoid warning, but of comforting closure.

“Neck of the Woods" is the debut collection of poetry from Amy Woolard, a legal aid attorney from Virginia. As the name suggests, much of Woolard’s collection centers around the exploration of the speaker in a small rural hometown — the speaker’s own neck of the woods. Woolard’s verses beg to be read deeply; each line she writes is in service of the larger narrative, but also can be treated as its own puzzle to be solved and interpreted.
Woolard mixes in a variation of forms, from long stream-of-conscious, paragraph-like stanzas to poems containing stanzas with consistent line patterns. Woolard doesn’t seem to restrict herself much in terms of form or meter, but lets her poems wander in numerous directions. This idea of letting her poems breathe in their own unique ways is no more apparent than in the poem “What She Didn’t Leave,” which is constructed so as to look more like a painting than a poem. The words are dappled across the page with inconsistent and unpredictable spacing. It’s also worth mentioning that this particular poem is oriented perpendicular to the rest of the book, running from bottom to top as opposed to from left to right, and continuing onto the next page as if it were just the extension of the first.
Woolard’s voice often employs puzzling symbolism and metaphor and weaves in a colloquial dialogue that interjects and accompanies the more cerebral language and imagery. The stories she portrays pertain to small town living, neighborhood gossip, longing, love, and a particular fixation on front porches.
Woolard’s collection is divided into four sections, all consisting of 17 to 20 pages. Each section begins with a poem titled “Spoiler” which seemingly spoils the outcome of some aspect of the story (whether that be that section of the collection, the collection as a whole, or the story that can be constructed using these disparate pieces from the speaker’s portrayal of her neck of the woods). The first poem in the collection begins with the line “It ends with the house in the sky” and “Spoiler” number three begins with the line “I’ve likely told you too much already”.
In this way, Woolard engages with her audience in a unique way; instead of placing the reader into the shoes of some subject referred to as “you” as many third-person poems do, Woolard addresses the audience. She lays out, unambiguously, that she is spoiling something if the reader cares enough to look deeply enough into the poem with a magnifying glass and a comb to pick out what that element actually is.
Woolard constructs the titular “neck of the woods” that the speaker depicts through stories that mostly display cultural norms and interactions rather than explicit descriptions of imagery. With stories of dirtied youth and reactionary norms of the town, the speaker renders her origin in a way removed from the physicality of the space.
Many of Woolard’s poems are in conversation with one another. For example, a poem entitled “Straw Man” is followed by a poem that contains the line “Straw is to heartless body as I lied when I said I hope I’ll see you all again is to Come home.” Woolard’s collection consists of disparate poems and stories that reference one another, creating an air of consistency and continuous storytelling — or at least creating a continuous portrait of the neck of the woods. The poem “Neck of the Woods” perfectly exemplifies this holistic view of the collection by referencing titles and nodding to lines from the other poems. As this poem finds itself as the titular player in the collection, it adds to the notions that these poems are seemingly disparate pieces to a puzzle that, when consumed and viewed as whole, work together to aid the reader in conceptualizing and understanding the speaker’s neck of the woods.
Woolard crafts a beautifully written, dark, emotional, cerebral, and, at times, humorous collection of poems that explores what it feels like to look back upon the places our lives were lived from. Woolard leans into the idea that poetry is a playground for subjectivity and interpretation whilst still remaining decently forthright in its emotional significance and its contextual weight. At points, the ambiguity could be seen as too intense, entangling the emotional effect in loose, difficult to follow metaphor the message. This method of poetic storytelling, however, is a matter of preference and Woolard is decently successful at creating a collection that speaks to lovers of more amorphous ‘feeling’ poems as well as those who are more inclined to read poetry that tells a cohesive and understandable story. With that having been said, Woolard’s poetry does require a more involved reading and those who passively consume poetry may find that the story is somewhat lost in the language without more intricate inspection.
Woolard writes a sinuous exploration and stylized depiction of the stories that come together to create the larger picture of where you come from and conversely the ways in which the place influences the person.

I once stole a cross from the Vatican.
My sister and I were on a trip through the eternal city. Late August in Rome is always too warm — sweltering, sultry heat, the kind that creeps up your back dampening it the minute you leave the shower. We’d waited outside the Vatican museums for almost an hour, eager to see the chaotic crypt of priceless art. But when we got to the front of the queue she wasn’t allowed in — her shorts were, well, too short for the place of worship. After an infuriating 20-minute conversation in botched Italian and the purchase of an overpriced shawl, we got in, just to stumble upon a huge, equally overpriced shop within the presumably holy site. Rosaries, bracelets, icons — all up for sale. Not that there’s anything in the Bible against that, you know.
As we left, we realized that we’d both dealt with our pent-up frustration in the same way — by pickpocketing a small cross pendant out of spite.
The petty theft made for a great story at pretentious Harvard socials. It also captured my general attitude towards organized religion; one largely defined by scorn and annoyance. Sure, the blatant hypocrisy and sexism of the specific situation bothered me. But it wasn’t the first time I’d dealt with it, and my reaction wasn’t exclusively motivated by having to cash out fifteen euro for a misanthropist piece of cloth. Spain is, after all, a very Catholic country by European standards. Even before my Vatican mini-heist, I’d grown used to dealing with the values that such a religious background creates, particularly when it came to queer issues. And I’d grown used to reacting accordingly.
My high school, like most high schools, sucked in a variety of different ways. Trapped in a neighborhood that overwhelmingly supports right-wing parties, our students were not exactly paralyzed by woke culture. I remember some depressing highlights, a collection of amusing homophobic vignettes. The “moderate” friendly acquaintances praising me personally but adding that, should they have a gay son, they’d immediately contact a psychiatrist. A Saturday night break-in into the school by a junior prankster who hung a rainbow flag from the building, and the avalanche of angry calls that led to its removal on a Sunday morning. (Their reasoning? The school seeks to “avoid educating the children to form any specific opinions in topics such as … sexual orientation.”)
I recall how some staff tried to do better, attempting to get my class to watch Stephen Fry’s “Wilde,” only to give up a few minutes in amid loud, homophobic complaints (if twinkish Jude Law doesn’t make you sympathize with gay men you’re beyond redemption). These views were based on a twisted understanding of the Catholic faith, one that saw queer people as, to quote a former classmate, “morally unhealthy.” And while I like to think that their effect on me was minimal — I spent the weekend of the flag incident with a remarkably cute Brit I met at Oxford (a university I may or may not have seriously considered attending just because of its latent homoeroticism) — they eroded my faith in the Vatican. I learned to expect nothing from the Catholic Church.
So when Pope Francis announced his support for same-sex civil unions last week I was shocked.
Shocked about the announcement, for sure — even under his leadership, the Catholic church has hardly been a BGLTQ ally. But more so, I was shocked by how happy I was. I found myself almost giddy bordering on ecstatic, reading and re-reading articles on the subject, texting friends and family. A smile spread across my face, one of those annoying ones that you can barely contain, the kind of grin that twists your features and makes it difficult to even speak without giggling. I looked back at my petty rebellion and, for the first time, I felt a twinge of sadness, a sliver of (certainly unwarranted) remorse.
I know I shouldn’t have reacted that way — not rationally, at least. Civil unions seem like the bare minimum in 2020, and the Church’s official position on so many other issues (chiefly abortion and contraceptives) is still terrible. I don’t have a connection to the institution or a religious family to stress about — I'm not even baptized, a relative rarity in Spain. Yet, no matter how hard I tried, I could barely rub the smile off my face or hide my glee. I was incredibly, irrationally happy.
Sometimes we find ourselves trying to grow up too quickly; to graduate from the value systems and institutions that messed us up. Many queer people are burnt young, marked by an iron of rejection, loneliness, and fear. And then, for the most part, we flee. To a bigger city, to a place where we can reinvent ourselves. I moved an ocean, a culture, a language away; I got myself drunk and allowed friends to put makeup on me and found mascara remarkably flattering; I watched every queer film out there (yes, all three of them).
But we never evolve as fast as we wish, and we never stop caring about what we leave behind. We still retrace the ridges of our scars, waiting for them to burst open and tear our flesh apart. We still crave the acceptance and the validation of the ideologies that we banish from our lives, of the institutions we attack, insult, and (at times) steal from.
I shouldn’t care what the Pope says. But I do. I really do.
He is the highest representative of a faith that underlies the pain and aggressiveness that helped define my upbringing — the same pain that shapes queer self-hatred and haunts our mental health. And so even if I reject the validity and legitimacy of the Church, I still feel vindicated by its sudden warming up to my existence; I’m still moved by the proclamation that “nobody should be thrown out, or made miserable” because of their sexuality. I feel vindicated by a moral framework that I was convinced I’d put behind me.
The episode reminded me of the importance of symbols; of the crucial power of having those we proclaim to hate tell us they love us. Of why something as seemingly inconsequential as changing a building’s name or removing a statue can have a tangible impact on our community. It lets some of us know that we’re seen.
I’ve lived in Rome for a few months now, having moved here when the pandemic halted my American ambitions. My friends have been pushing me to go watch the Pope speak, more out of cultural curiosity than faith. I’ve avoided doing so so far — but I might just go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we near the end of an exhausting election cycle, it’s hard to blame anyone who feels inclined to dabble in electoral reform. Massachusetts voters will soon get their opportunity with Ballot Question 2, a proposal to adopt ranked-choice voting in most races across the state. A “Yes” victory will fundamentally change the way our state gets to choose its elected officials.
Under the current system, known as “first-past-the-post” to academics who study elections, voters select one candidate each, and the election winner is the person who receives the most votes. If there are more than two candidates, the winner may end up with less than 50 percent support, often by a considerable margin: In 2018, Representative Lori A. L. Trahan (D-Mass.) won the election for Massachusetts’s Third Congressional seat after earning less than 22 percent of the vote in a fractured Democratic primary that saw 10 candidates compete.
Under the proposed system, voters will be asked to rank the candidates in order of preference, including as few or as many as they like. If one candidate earns more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round, they will be declared the winner. Otherwise, votes will be redistributed in successive rounds until one candidate has majority support. In each round, the candidate with the fewest top-place rankings is eliminated, and their votes are awarded to the next ranked candidate on their supporters’ ballots.
On the Yes side is Voter Choice for Massachusetts, which contends that democracy requires a voting algorithm that enacts a majority, rather than a plurality, rule. They point to races like that won by Rep. Trahan in the third district, estimating that up to 40 percent of contested elections with at least three candidates are won with no candidate achieving a simple majority. As a normal feature of the system — this year, it happened again — this seems sub-optimal. Ranked-choice voting is a safeguard against minority rule that will do away with coalition-splitting and spoiler candidates, and ensure that widely disfavored candidates cannot ride into office on the backs of a slim but vocal minority.
But ranked-choice voting is about much more than majority rule. It’s about overhauling the tone and tenor of electoral politics. In anticipation of having to rank the candidates, voters are encouraged to engage with multiple campaigns rather than selecting one champion and ignoring the rest. On the candidate side, ranked-choice voting encourages campaigns to focus on positive messaging as they vie for higher rankings: Trashing a voter’s first-place candidate isn’t a good strategy if you want to earn a second-place vote that might decide the election. When the votes are counted, 50 percent of the electorate will have expressed some kind of support for the winner, which should serve to reduce disillusionment among voters whose first-choice candidate is unsuccessful and increase politicians’ sense of accountability to the wider electorate.
Opponents contend that the proposed system is too confusing for voters. Sitting in the cradle of ranked-choice voting — Cambridge has used preference rankings since 1941, longer than any other jurisdiction in the country — we find this argument baffling. Ranked-choice voting is arguably easier than normal voting, since voters are free to rank their actual, honest preferences, with no regard for strategic considerations like “electability” or trying to guess how other segments of the electorate will vote. Undergraduates have a double familiarity with preference rankings: Harvard’s Undergraduate Council is one of over 50 college student governments in the U.S. whose elections are conducted with a variant of ranked-choice voting. We have confidence that our standardized test-obsessed education system has more than adequately prepared the electorate to properly bubble in a list of preferences.
Ranked-choice voting is back in the national conversation on electoral reform. Cambridge voters have set the stage for similar systems in municipalities like San Francisco, Minneapolis, and New York City, and state-level experiments are underway in Maine and the five states that allowed ranked-choice voting in Democratic primaries this spring. It’s time for Massachusetts to join the movement. Vote Yes on Ballot Question Two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, graduate student musicians pursuing their M.M. degree in Performance join the audition circuit in search of an orchestral job. In the preceding months, they might spend more than eight hours each day practicing the lists of excerpts each orchestra provides — maybe Oklahoma is this month, then Nashville three weeks after, then Pittsburgh a couple of months out. They fall behind on schoolwork, regularly skipping class to practice. Years of preparation goes into these auditions, but a shaky finger, quivering lip, or sweaty palm has cost many serious musicians a much-needed job.
What if that could all go away? What if you could buy a clear mind and a relaxed body? It wouldn’t exactly make you a better musician, but it might bring out your best at a time when your best isn’t physically available.
There is such a silver bullet: the beta blocker. But is it undermining the industry?
A 2016 survey of more than 5,000 classical musicians revealed that 72 percent use or had used beta blockers in their lives, up from only about 30 percent in 1987. But few will readily admit it. For decades now, audition finalists have been operating under the influence, continuing the habit for professional orchestras for high-stakes performances. These drugs slow the heart and dull one’s senses enough to stop a tremor or catch those abdominal butterflies. Users can achieve years of mindfulness practice in just an hour. And few experience any side effects or complications.
Music and drugs have always had a close relationship. Cannabis and psychedelics, just as examples, are responsible for a great deal of the music we listen to today, with our favorite jazz, rock, hip-hop, and pop musicians extolling their effects now for decades. Popular musicians are expected to promote drug use, even as young people watch a parade of their favorite artists martyred by overdose deaths. Even some classical music, most famously Hector Berlioz’ “Symphonie fantastique,” has been influenced by drugs.
But for modern classical musicians, the choice to dope is not to achieve an artistic nirvana, but job security.
Beta blockers are by no means a direct phone line to the Muse. In fact, their dulling effects make you less sharp — an audition isn’t about being at your mental prime as much as your physical prime. Nothing you play at an audition should be spontaneous, but rather repeated so many times that your muscles can perform without thinking. It’s less art than sport.
The World Anti-Doping Association classifies beta blockers as performance-enhancing drugs. They are prohibited in golf, automobile racing, archery, shooting, and some ski and snowboard events. In 2008, a North Korean double Olympic medalist in pistol events had both medals taken away for use of the beta blocker propranolol. If your favorite golfer at the Masters Tournament, ski jumper in the Olympics, or Formula One driver in Monaco tested positive for beta-blockers, they would be stripped of their honors, too.
So why are orchestral musicians allowed to take these drugs on the job?
It would be unfathomable for a math professor to advise his students to take an Adderall before a technical interview, but in the current state of the field, some might argue that a music professor that truly wants the best for her students would be shortchanging them by not broaching the subject of beta-blockers.
Sports have governing bodies to sanction events and impose rules. Classical music isn’t a sport, and there exists no such organization to enforce something like drug use unilaterally. Nor have individual orchestras stepped up in this regard. There are simply no rules about them, and without guidance from above, the beta-blocker issue becomes one of peer pressure and individual judgment. The culture surrounding them is translucent: Most everyone in the field knows about their widespread use, but few would publicize that they once relied, or still do rely, on them, fearing it as a show of weakness or a taboo in the supposedly straight-laced field of classical music.
The conversation about drugs in an academic setting caused one college to controversially fire a flute instructor in 2004 who had been promoting beta-blockers among her adult students. The episode was widely publicized and only further hindered any chances for open discussion about the drugs. Shoving the issue under the rug is irresponsible and dangerous — a classical musician deciding to use beta-blockers shouldn’t have to go it alone, procuring drugs from friends or convincing unwitting doctors for prescriptions.
The industry faces a choice: either destigmatize beta-blockers and provide health resources, such as an in-house medical team to provide and monitor dosage, or ban them and introduce a system of drug testing as enforcement. Either option is valid, and in the absence of a regulatory body, individual organizations should be allowed to make their own choices about implementing them.
But the unacceptable third choice is to continue as we are now, ignoring musician wellness and keeping widespread drug use in the dark. Like it or not, beta blockers clearly play a part in the profession, and orchestras and conservatories have a duty to acknowledge them and be clear about their expectations. It’s time to admit that our musical ivory comes from the elephant in the room.

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study hosted a webinar Tuesday addressing the connections between obesity, COVID-19, and systemic racism.
Two panelists at the event — Harvard Chan School and Radcliffe Institute professor Sara N. Bleich and University of California at Irvine Associate Professor Sabrina A. Strings — discussed how slavery-era inequities are linked to modern health disparities, higher obesity, and disproportionately high COVID-19 mortality rates among Black Americans. The event was part of “Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery,” an initiative University President Lawrence S. Bacow launched last November.
Strings addressed recent claims linking obesity to COVID-19 mortality rates between racial groups, which she said present an incomplete picture. A “mere eight percentage point disparity” in obesity rates exists between Black and white Americans, Strings said.
“The problem is not obesity, the problem is slavery,” she said.
To highlight this historical link, Strings gave the example of J. Marion Sims, who performed forced gynecological experimentation on enslaved women.
“The field of medicine is invested in using Black cells, Black body parts, Black tissues for the advancement of medical progress, but not Black whole human beings,” she said.
Strings critiqued the Body Mass Index — a common calculation used to measure obesity — and disputed the legitimacy of research used to create it. She added that she believes “very powerful white men” pushed the use of BMI in medicine.
“Black people were excluded from the very studies that are now attempting to discipline them,” Strings said. “BMI cannot account for the 3.2 times higher rate of COVID-19 deaths amongst Black Americans.”
Bleich — the second panelist — gave a presentation on the ties among COVID-19, obesity, and systemic racism from a public health perspective.
According to Bleich, obese COVID-19 patients are twice as likely to be hospitalized and 50 percent more likely to die. She added that researchers are not entirely certain why this is the case.
“Here's what we do know,” she said. “There are these longstanding structural inequities that are underlining why we are seeing higher rates of COVID-19, higher rates of obesity, amongst Black and brown populations.”
Bleich said that since Black people are more likely to be employed in essential industries like nursing homes and grocery stores, they are also more likely to interact with infected people. She added that these industries are also less likely to provide health or life insurance.
“We know that if you are a Black American, you have fewer economic and educational opportunities as compared to whites,” she said. “What that does is confer fewer financial resources, which then increases social risks like food insecurity, housing instability, limited access to transportation, and that list sort of goes on and on.”
Bleich also called for the government to expand nutrition assistance programs, bring Medicaid to every state, and pass additional fiscal stimulus bills to address the health crisis.
“A lot of thought needs to go into how we frame these issues around COVID-19, around obesity, to ensure that programs that stand to help people the most can actually get pushed forward,” she said.

UPDATED: October 29, 2020, 7:54 p.m.
Harvard Athletics has spared its personnel and 42 NCAA Division I programs from cuts as it drastically reduces operations in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Director of Athletics Erin McDermott said in a Tuesday interview.
McDermott, who began her tenure as Harvard’s first female Athletics Director this summer, said she spent her first four months at the helm finding ways to make the department “austere in our operation.”
Harvard’s fields, courts, and pools now sit largely empty as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The Ivy League canceled the fall sports season and Harvard limited on-campus living to freshmen and a small share of upperclassmen this semester to curtail virus's spread.
McDermott said the global health crisis has naturally circumscribed the department’s operations.
“Operations are so drastically different without having competition, you know, we’re not traveling teams, we’re not hosting competition,” she said. “With the student athletes that we have on campus, and with our recreational operations that we have ongoing for students and staff on campus, we’re operating really on an as need — and what’s really essential — kind of way.”
“There wasn’t really definitive, necessarily ‘cuts’ that were made,” McDermott added. “We’re just not doing all the same things that we would typically do.”
Still, the department has not broken even.
McDermott said two major sources of revenue the Athletics Department lost include the Harvard-Yale football game — which Harvard was scheduled to host next month — as well as the Boston Calling Music Festival, which takes place at the athletics complex every spring. As a result, McDermott said, a large part of her day-to-day job over the past four months has consisted of schmoozing potential donors virtually and soliciting their contributions.
“As far as major revenue streams, at this point, it's really philanthropy — we're really working on those efforts," she said. "That's been a main focus for me in these first few months...connecting with our alumni, and certainly our kind of loyal philanthropist donors for the department."
Though McDermott did not state the extent of the department’s financial losses, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — which oversees Harvard Athletics — netted more than $30 million in “unforeseen expenses and lost revenue” associated with the coronavirus as of April.
Despite financial pressures, Harvard Athletics has not cut any of its teams or fired its employees, according to McDermott.
While universities across the country — including peer schools such as Dartmouth and Stanford — have recently axed a handful of athletics programs to improve their balance sheets, McDermott said Harvard has not considered eliminating any of its 42 varsity teams — the most of any university in the country.
“There haven’t been conversations about cutting teams,” she said.
McDermott also said the department has been “fortunate” not to have to reduce its payroll, though it has adhered to the University-wide hiring freeze.

Harvard filed an opposition Thursday in response to Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber’s lawsuit alleging the University is contractually obligated to pay for his legal defense against federal fraud charges.
In its filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued Lieber relinquished his right to indemnification and advancement of defense costs when he knowingly lied to the University and the federal government about his activities in China.
Federal authorities arrested Lieber in January on charges of making fraudulent statements to government officials investigating his funding sources; Harvard officials placed Lieber on leave and announced an internal inquiry following his arrest. Federal officials alleged he misrepresented his affiliation with China’s Thousand Talents Program and failed to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
A federal grand jury indicted Lieber in June for making false statements; he pleaded not guilty. Federal authorities later charged him with tax offenses related to the income he allegedly received from Chinese sources in a superseding indictment.
Lieber’s lawsuit alleges Harvard breached its contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to indemnify him. The suit claims Lieber is covered under Harvard’s indemnification policy as a “Qualified Person” acting in a “Covered Role” at all times relevant to the federal charges filed against him. He requested the Middlesex Superior Court judge issue a preliminary injunction requiring Harvard to pay the legal fees.
Harvard’s opposition to the motion, however, alleges Lieber intentionally lied to Harvard and federal authorities, precluding him from receiving indemnification under the policy.
“Employees who privilege their own interests over Harvard’s, whether by acting in bad faith, violating University policies, engaging in various forms of misconduct, or seeking an improper financial benefit, are not entitled to indemnification or, therefore, advancement,” Harvard’s opposition reads. “Lieber engaged in precisely the kind of self-dealing conduct that precludes advancement.”
“It cannot be the law that a professor can (i) mislead Harvard, (ii) allegedly lie to the United States, (iii) cause Harvard to make misstatements to the United States, (iv) get charged criminally, and then (v) insist that Harvard must advance his defense costs—regardless of his conduct—because the stakes in the criminal case are high,” the opposition concludes. “Any such holding would effectively compel Harvard, in violation of its policies and expectations of faculty conduct, to advance defense costs from its charitable assets to employees who engage in bad-faith conduct for the purpose of enriching themselves.”
Lieber’s attorney in the civil case, David R. Suny, wrote in an emailed statement that his team expects the court to favor his client.
“We look forward to the Court’s ruling which we anticipate will vindicate Professor Lieber’s right to advancement by Harvard of his reasonable defense costs in the criminal case,” Suny wrote.
Harvard’s indemnification policy states the University will advance legal costs for qualified employees as long as the employee agrees to repay the costs if they are determined not to be entitled to indemnification — often subject to the outcome of a criminal case. The next sentence, however, states the University is not obligated to advance legal costs for an employee if it is “reasonably likely” they would not be entitled to indemnification.
Lieber’s filing argued the latter portion of the policy is “hopelessly ambiguous” and “at odds” with the first sentence.
Harvard’s lawyers retorted in their opposition that Lieber relies on a “distortedly selective” reading of the indemnification policy and called it a “strained attempt to generate ambiguity.”
The filing provides the clearest view yet into the University’s internal investigation of Lieber’s behavior. Administrators have repeatedly declined to provide any details or timeline on the investigation during interviews with The Crimson.
According to the filing, Lieber requested indemnification and advancement on March 31. On May 19, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp denied advancement, writing that, due to Lieber’s misrepresentation of his activities in China, it was “reasonably likely” he would “not be entitled to indemnification.” Separately, she declined to indemnify Lieber on tax charges filed in July because they relate to his personal tax obligations.
Lieber then requested the Harvard Corporation — which has ultimate discretion in indemnifying an employee and advancing legal costs — take a vote on his request. On Sept. 14, the Corporation affirmed Lapp’s decision to deny advancement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least once per day, Michael Yin ’22 finds himself doing something young people aren’t exactly known for: checking his mailbox.
Yin — a Maryland native living in Massachusetts for the semester — has been left in limbo as he awaits the arrival of an absentee ballot, which he says he requested over a month ago.
“When there’s some mail, I get excited thinking that maybe it’s the ballot — but it hasn’t been,” he said.
With less than a week to go until Election Day on Tuesday, Yin said he has signed up to do get-out-the-vote phone banking so he is able to participate in the democratic process, even if his ballot ultimately doesn’t arrive on time.
Harvard students across the country have confronted similar mail delays — along with signature rejections, defective envelopes, and other obstacles to mail-in voting — amid a pandemic-spurred flood of absentee ballot requests that is overwhelming local elections officials around the country.
“In many ways, I feel like [officials] were not prepared to do absentee voting at this level,” said Kyra I. March ’22, who is still awaiting her ballot after sending in two requests to local election officials in South Carolina, the first of which they told her did not arrive.
March, who expects her ballot to arrive in the coming days, said she plans to ship it back with Priority Mail Express in the hope that it will arrive by Nov. 3. South Carolina is one of 32 states that require ballots to arrive — rather than be postmarked — by Election Day.
“I think it can really turn off younger voters from wanting to even cast their absentee ballot,” she said of such hurdles.
Maya E. Woods-Arthur ’23, the Organizing Director of the Harvard Votes Challenge — which aims to increase voter turnout among Harvard affiliates — said organizers have seen an uptick in the number of students facing barriers to voting.
“Elections offices are severely underfunded and don’t have the capacity to deal with this overwhelming interest in voting by mail,” Woods-Arthur said. “So of course their systems are slower and of course they’re not able to update information in time, which is super unfortunate for students who want to vote absentee.”
Voting processes and procedures that vary widely by state have further complicated HVC's efforts, according to Woods-Arthur.
For Mississippi native Noah Harris ’22, for example, voting absentee requires a notary public to certify a signature on both the absentee ballot request and the ballot itself.
“In Mississippi, just in general, it’s very difficult to vote,” Harris said. “I don’t think there’s a state where it’s more difficult to vote in the country, absentee at least. There’s just so many hoops you have to jump through.”
Although he says he changed his address on record, Harris’ first ballot was mailed to his former address at Dunster House, requiring him to request another one.
“If I wasn’t so passionate about this, and about voting and about politics in general, it would be really easy for me to just say, ‘why bother with it?’” Harris said. “And that’s maybe the goal of some people in the country, to have young people not want to engage with the process because it’s so difficult.”
Rick Li ’21 said his ballot was initially rejected by elections officials in Illinois after they raised a problem with his signature. He ultimately had to send in an affidavit attesting to the validity of the ballot.
“I feel like I’m a person who’s very much on top of it usually, and so it just made me really, really worried for vote-by-mail in general this election,” Li, a Crimson Arts editor, said.
Some problems required more creative solutions. When Bhushan A. Patel ’22 — whose home state of Pennsylvania was decided by a margin of less than 1 percent in the 2016 presidential election — received his absentee ballot, both the secrecy envelope and the return envelope were already sealed.
Unable to reach local officials to request a new ballot after several tries, Patel said he put the envelopes in the fridge overnight to weaken the glue, then worked them open. Others around the country have reported similar problems, including former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Y. Abrams during the state’s June presidential primary.
“We hear all the time that if you want to be heard as a young person, you should vote,” Harris said. “But there’s just such a significant amount of voters who are disenfranchised because the process is so difficult.”

Legal experts say recent court filings indicate Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber — charged with lying to federal officials investigating his funding sources and ties to China — may try to convince jurors that he was swept up in the Trump administration’s broader anti-China campaign.
Lieber’s legal team may try to focus its defense around how Lieber’s prosecution connects to the Justice Department’s China Initiative, an ongoing series of prosecutions beginning in 2018 related to allegations that China perpetrated intellectual property theft, according to experts.
Federal authorities arrested Lieber in January on charges of making fraudulent statements to U.S. government officials who were investigating his funding sources. Officials alleged he misrepresented his affiliation with the Thousand Talents Program and failed to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
A federal grand jury indicted Lieber in June for making false statements; he pled not guilty. He was later charged in a superseding indictment with tax offenses related to the income he allegedly received from Chinese sources.
Marc L. Mukasey, Lieber’s attorney, said during an Oct. 16 hearing that Lieber intends to bring the case to trial promptly.
“It is Professor Lieber’s desire to bring this case to trial as soon as possible,” he said.
“Professor Lieber pleaded not guilty because he is not guilty,” he added in an emailed statement Friday. “We intend to exercise our right to a speedy trial so the world can see how he’s been used as a poster boy for a twisted political agenda and that the case against him is a crock.”
The Justice Department linked the arrest of Lieber and two Chinese nationals to its China Initiative in a January press release announcing their arrests.
“These cases are part of the Department of Justice’s China Initiative, which reflects the strategic priority of countering Chinese national security threats and reinforces the President’s overall national security strategy,” the Justice Department’s January press release reads.
Lieber’s lawyers may have seized on that public statement and others made by prosecutors around the time of Lieber’s arrest as central to their strategy. In September, they filed a motion to compel production of a broad swath of materials related to the China Initiative and other Justice Department prosecutions of individuals in the Thousand Talents program.
“At the heart of the charges is what it means to participate in Thousand Talents,” Torrey K. Young, Lieber’s other attorney, said during the Oct. 16 hearing. “The government must benchmark what it means to participate in Thousand Talents.”
Young said the materials from other China Initiative cases would be necessary because it is unclear “where this line is” on behavior related to China.
“It’s a China Initiative prosecution,” she said.
They also requested grand jury minutes, and Young argued that there had been “hyperbole around this case” due to the U.S. government’s “extremely anti-China agenda.”
“We think there is enough disparity between how this case was characterized publicly and what it’s really about” to warrant releasing the grand jury minutes, she said.
Prosecutors pushed back on the links to the broader initiative, however, noting Lieber had been charged with making false statements — not directly for his participation in Thousand Talents — so the materials would not be relevant to the case.
Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler sided with the government and denied the motion on Oct. 17.
Elizabeth O. McCarthy, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts, declined to comment Tuesday on questions about whether the DOJ was now trying to distance Lieber’s case from the China Initiative.
Three legal experts who have worked on similar cases concurred that the case is linked to the China Initiative, given the nature of the case and the Justice Department’s press release.
Derek Adams, a partner at Potomac Law Group in Washington, said Lieber’s team may be trying to use the case’s context within the China Initiative to argue that the professor was “swept up into this larger China initiative” and thus unfairly prosecuted.
“You’re trying to loop in this case into the bigger picture, to try to have a jury see that perhaps Charles Lieber was kind of pulled into something that’s broader than him,” he said. “That that’s effectively what the prosecution is about — this bigger initiative — rather than the specific statements that he made.”
Adams, a former Justice Department trial attorney, said that in turn, it makes sense the government may want to distance Lieber’s case from the initiative.
“With any case, they don't want to litigate their whole initiative — they want to just litigate this case, and they want to just make it about the specific false statements that they allege occurred,” he said. “You can also understand then why the defense would want to make it about a broader movement that could potentially rub some folks the wrong way in a jury.”
Though experts agreed the case against Lieber is tied to the China Initiative, they said it differs from other China Initiative cases because Lieber is not a Chinese national, but a prominent American scientist.
Kristen M. Schwendinger — a senior counsel at Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell LLP specializing in practices including federal grants and government investigations — said Lieber’s case is notable for that reason.
“It stood out compared to others in a line of cases of university professors that happened to be from China, though not all cases have involved people of Chinese nationality,” Schwendinger said.
Catherine X. Pan — a partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP and leader of the firm’s U.S.-China transactional practice — said while she does not have access to private case documents, she was “surprised” by authorities’ decision to pursue criminal charges against Lieber, rather than using other means.
Pan noted that Lieber is one of only around 30 people in history to be elected into all three National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and she questioned whether the suit against Lieber helps the U.S. stay on top of the U.S.-China tech war.
“The U.S. needs to have the top talent continuing to work for the U.S. and contribute to the U.S., so I don’t know if this type of heavy-handed prosecution and criminal arrest and charges really serves that purpose,” Pan said.
Pan also said she thinks the exact amounts Lieber allegedly received from Chinese sources may have been lost in translation. While FBI special agent Robert Plumb’s affidavit states that the Wuhan Institute of Technology agreed to pay Lieber $50,000 per month, prorated according to his actual time worked at the institute, the Justice Department’s January press release alleged WIT paid Lieber $50,000 per month without such a qualification. Lieber would not have been able to work in China 12 months a year while also holding a full professorship at Harvard, Pan said.
“Amounts matter because we’re thinking whether this is material enough to be a criminal charge,” Pan said.
In early October, Lieber filed a civil case against Harvard, alleging the University broke its contract by refusing to indemnify him for his defense. Experts said Lieber’s civil suit aligns with the legal strategy that began with his not guilty plea.
Pan called the indemnification suit a “critical step” in Lieber’s legal strategy.
“I think this is a critical step in their legal strategy because without sufficient support and financial resources, lawyers can be very expensive,” she said. “Without that kind of resource and support, it would be very difficult for Professor Lieber to properly defend himself.”
Schwendinger, the Feldesman Tucker counsel, said issues of indemnity are “not uncommon” in cases against officers in any corporation.
“It is not uncommon for issues of indemnity clauses to come up in the wake of civil or criminal allegations against officers or executives in any corporation, whether or not it’s in the university context or otherwise,” Schwendinger said. “It is a matter of contract law whether or not Professor Lieber would be successful on his arguments. He certainly has a right to make this argument before the courts.”
Adams, the Potomac Law partner, added that the civil suit is “consistent” with Lieber’s position in the criminal case.
“If you’re not guilty in the criminal case, then you can understand why he would take the view, ‘well, I should be covered,’” he said.
Regardless of the outcome in the civil case, however, Adams said Lieber’s criminal prosecution may inform the actions of defense lawyers — and even federal prosecutors — in other China Initiative cases.
“If this case goes to trial, it will be a really interesting case to watch because the DOJ will be put to a task in terms of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said. “It will probably have an influence on how some other cases are either tried, brought, not brought, whether pleas are taken or not taken.”
