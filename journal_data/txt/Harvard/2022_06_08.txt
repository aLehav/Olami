After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
French auteur Claire Denis’s latest film is based on the 1986 novel “The Stars at Noon” by Denis Johnson, which takes place during the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1984. In her screen adaptation, however, Denis transports Johnson’s narrative to the present day so that it unfolds during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film follows Trish (Margaret Qualley), a young American journalist, as she meets the mysterious Englishman Daniel (Joe Alwyn) against the backdrop of the country’s simmering political tensions. Their blossoming romance is complicated once Costa Rican police start chasing Daniel, and they scramble to flee Nicaragua together. Denis’s latest effort is commendable for its exciting pace and distinctively sultry mood, but the romance at the core of the film is not strong enough to fully draw audiences into the muddled world of its underwritten protagonists.
What exactly brought Trish to Nicaragua remains mysterious, and without knowing her motives it’s difficult to sympathize with her. At one point, she briefly alludes to having written some controversial articles on “kidnappings and hangings,” which presumably landed her in hot water. Beyond that blink-and-you’ll-miss-it context clue, she doesn’t seem to have a particular purpose in the country at the time the film starts; she is only desperate to leave the U.S. and continue her journalism career elsewhere. However, her boss, played by John C. Reilly in a brief but hilarious video call cameo, insists he is not actually her boss and she is not actually a journalist — she’s more of a floundering freelancer. In exchange for money and support, Trish has been sleeping with a military officer and a government official, but even they won’t help her get a passport to leave.
Trish’s relationship with Daniel also begins transactionally: After meeting at a hotel bar, he pays her 50 U.S. dollars to have sex with him. Although they frustratingly never learn anything truly substantive about each other, their originally superficial relationship quickly transforms into something else, and their romance drives the narrative. The attraction between the pair is made all the more intense by Daniel and Trish’s stressful circumstances. Once Trish spots an undercover Costa Rican cop (Danny Ramirez) who wants to arrest Daniel, they go on the run together.
Alwyn is well cast as the elusive Daniel (although at this point he is perhaps being typecast as the reserved, smoldering man), but even his charm can’t bring to life an underwritten character like Daniel. He is more of a stereotype than a nuanced person: the prototypical Cool, Secretive Man who moodily smokes cigarettes instead of revealing anything about himself. While Trish is also underdeveloped, Qualley is at least allowed to be more expressive in her acting; Daniel is consistently stoic and impenetrable. The opaque characters would be forgivable, perhaps, if Alwyn and Qualley shared a certain level of chemistry. Unfortunately, while the film is rife with sex scenes, there isn’t a powerful electricity between them. They are both beautiful, talented actors, but that is not itself an instant recipe for success.
This is not to say they are altogether unengaging on screen. There are several moments of bittersweet intimacy between them. In one standout scene, they sway back and forth in an empty club to the smoky lilt of Staurt Staples’s vocals. Awash in a pastel pink light, the romantic atmosphere is enough to move even the most cynical viewer. Whenever Trish fears she’s been separated from Daniel for good only to reunite with him soon after, their tight, prolonged embraces are heartwarming. As a couple, they are certainly not without their charm, but a magnetic pull between them is absent.
Although the thriller element of “Stars at Noon” is often confusing, the film keeps viewers on edge, mostly as they attempt to untangle the mystery of the plot. Granted, it is steadily paced as well. The jazzy, saxophone heavy score, composed by frequent Denis collaborator Tindersticks, helps establish the fluidity of the narrative and its sultry tone. However, viewers can’t help but wonder: Who is Daniel, and why is he really in Nicaragua? With the film no longer set during the Nicaraguan Revolution, how do Trish and Daniel fit into the country’s current political climate? The narrative becomes a gritty and suspenseful look at their trek through urban and rural terrain as they try to outrun the police, but is without the necessary context. Daniel’s crisp white suit becomes increasingly dirty and rumpled as they move along, perhaps more reflective of his interiority than any of his dialogue. (It’s a miracle they get anywhere considering how much they’re drinking, particularly Trish.)
Captivating as their game of cat and mouse is, Trish and Daniel aren’t likable enough protagonists for viewers to care deeply about whether or not they will outrun their pursuers and end up together. While Daniel is unknowable, Trish sometimes veers toward being irritating. She is certainly intended to be flawed, which is often refreshing in lead characters, but she isn’t someone to root for in spite of or because of her flaws. Qualley is nevertheless a commanding actress, embodying her many quirks with a discernible liveliness. She modulates between crying fits, aggravated arguments, and drunken hazes with ease.
While the star-crossed lovers story is compelling and buoyed by two impressive actors, the script of “Stars at Noon” does not lend its characters adequate depth or elucidate the details of its complicated plot. If Trish isn’t a working journalist like she says (she isn’t really, at least not anymore), and Daniel isn’t in the oil business like he claims (he definitely isn’t), who are they underneath the narratives they present to the world? By the end of the film, they are still two difficult-to-pin-down characters — the audience doesn’t know them, and they might not even know each other.

Content Warning: Violence
In 2001, serial killer Saeed Hanaei confessed to killing 16 female sex workers in the holy city of Mashhad, Iran. Hanaei made no effort to plead innocent — in fact, he admitted to his gruesome crimes with pride. He even said he would still be murdering women if he hadn’t been caught. His motivation? He claimed he was fulfilling his religious duty of “cleansing” the city.
Iranian director Ali Abbasi’s latest film “Holy Spider,” which premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 22, is loosely based on the true story of the murderer known as the Spider Killer — so named for the way he would lure women into his “web” and strangle them with their headscarves like a spider traps its prey. In adapting this true crime story, Abbasi took the creative liberty of inserting fictional journalist Rahimi (Zar Amir-Ebrahimi) into the center of his narrative, who takes it upon herself to get to the bottom of the mysterious killing spree. With Amir-Ebrahimi’s bold and arresting performance at the foreground, Abassi’s film is an unflinchingly grim depiction of the toll of patriarchal violence.
“Holy Spider” begins by introducing the audience to the women that the Spider Killer (played by Mehdi Bajestani) targets: sex workers, many of whom are addicted to drugs. He believes these women are corrupted and that he is doing society a service by killing them. The women he targets are also mothers and daughters, and they are portrayed with devastating humanity before each of them are brutally killed. The first victim is shown leaving her child for the night, putting on makeup, and changing into high heels in a public bathroom. In this opening sequence, Abbasi takes us through Hanaei’s disturbing routine: He picks this woman up on his motorcycle before taking her to his house where he strangles her to death, using her chador as a body bag and disposing of her. He repeats this again and again.
There are multiple murders of sex workers shown in the first half of the film, and Abbasi doesn’t shy away from their gruesome, horrific details. In each scene, this extreme violence is difficult to watch, especially after each woman’s own personhood is revealed to the audience for a brief period. The violence blurs the line between a gratuitous inclusion and an authentic depiction of the unbelievable horrors of misogyny. Though less gut-churning than the murders, the portrayal of Hanaei’s family life — he is married with three children — is also deeply unsettling. In one scene, he is shown playing with his young daughter at home; soon after, he is killing another woman. The dissonance is spine-chilling.
As the murders increase, Rahimi realizes she is more invested in the safety of sex workers in the city than the police or anyone else around her. She goes to extreme lengths to catch the killer, leaving the audience peeking between their fingers in fear as she makes increasingly risky decisions. Amir-Ebrahimi delivers a stunning lead performance as the fierce, self-possessed, and unwaveringly courageous Rahimi, who is well deserving of Cannes’s Silver Palm Award for Best Actress. Her talent lies in her acerbic line delivery and her striking facial expressions — her unwavering gaze, the determined set of her jaw.
Although one might expect the climax of a serial killer crime procedural to depict the capture of the murderer, Hanaei is arrested relatively early in “Holy Spider” after Rahimi uncovers his identity in a near-death sting operation. She executes this mission of her own accord with only the help of a fellow journalist. If almost unbelievable in the way it plays out, it’s nevertheless a captivating, nerve-racking scene.
The second half of the film is dedicated to portraying Hanaei’s trial and the public reaction to his murders. Instead of condemning his violence or recoiling in fear, many people side with him and praise his “cleansing” of the city. Witnessing this positive reception to 16 murdered women — which did happen in real life — is one of the most unnerving parts of the film. Protestors gather outside the court in support of his release; his wife is devastated not that he has killed so many women but that he might be sentenced to death for his actions. What’s most heartbreaking is seeing his young son at first question his father’s actions and then come to regurgitate his same twisted beliefs. The cycle of patriarchal violence continues.
At the premiere of “Holy Spider” at Cannes’s Grand Théâtre Lumière, Abbasi spoke on the meaning behind his film. He felt there was always an injustice done toward the victims of the Spider Killer, in that they were often overlooked in discussions of his crimes. “Even when people condemn this… they never mention those women. And I feel that there is a little, little,” — Abassi held up his thumb and forefinger close together — “this small piece of justice here being played out tonight.” While “Holy Spider” is often difficult to watch, Abbasi succeeds in depicting the devastating and immeasurable human loss resulting from Hanaei’s acts of violence, while also showing the misogynistic societal values that enabled his actions.
“Holy Spider” is a gripping and deeply sinister film, especially for those previously unaware of the Spider Killer’s crimes. While Rahimi’s feminist advocacy is inspiring, it’s ultimately a bleak, disheartening story of unrelenting oppression — which makes it all the more urgent that it be told nonetheless.

Harvard Medical School professors Eileen E. Reynolds ’86 ​​and Daniel G. Deschler will serve as Leverett House’s interim faculty deans, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to Leverett affiliates Tuesday.
Beginning July 1, Reynolds and Deschler will take over the role from outgoing faculty deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras, who announced last week that they will step down later this month after holding the role for four years.
“I appreciate their warm and engaging nature, enthusiasm, and commitment to building a vital and inclusive community at Leverett House,” Khurana said of Reynolds and Deschler in his announcement.
Reynolds, who teaches at Harvard Medical School and serves as chief of general internal medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, attended Harvard College and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1990. Reynolds’ work centers on “gender equity in academic medicine,” Khurana wrote.
Deschler, a professor of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School since 2011, graduated from Creighton University in 1986 and attended Harvard Medical School alongside Reynolds. Deschler has taught at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary since 2000, and he serves as MEEI’s vice chair of academic affairs in the Department of Otolaryngology.
Current Leverett resident tutor John F. Nowak will take over as interim resident dean, Khurana included in the announcement. Nowak, a Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, previously served as an interim resident dean at Currier House. He replaces outgoing resident dean Katie Daily, who announced her departure from Leverett in April.
“John is a valued member of the Harvard College community, and I know that he will thrive in this new role,” Khurana wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around one third of respondents to The Crimson’s annual survey of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences reported that they believe at least one colleague in their department has been unjustly denied tenure.
Just over 33 percent of respondents indicated that they somewhat or strongly agree that someone in their department was unfairly rejected in Harvard’s tenure process — a number on par with last year.
Slightly fewer respondents — just under 28 percent — indicated that they strongly or somewhat disagree that at least one colleague in their department was unjustly denied tenure. A plurality of respondents — nearly 39 percent — said they neither agree nor disagree.
The Crimson distributed its survey to more than 1,100 members of the FAS and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, polling tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty on their demographics, academic life, and viewpoints on various issues, including Harvard governance.
The 111-question survey garnered 476 responses, including 333 that were complete and 143 that were partially filled out. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from April 11 to 26. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first installment of The Crimson’s 2022 faculty survey explored views on sexual harassment at Harvard, while the second installment examined how faculty view Harvard’s Covid-19 response. This third installment examines attitudes toward tenure, recent changes to the tenure-track review process, and the livelihoods of non-tenure-track faculty.
An FAS committee that reviewed Harvard’s tenure processes published a report last October that concluded the school’s system is “structurally sound,” but noted that ladder faculty feel a “lack of trust in” and “low morale” about the process.
In March, FAS Dean Claudine Gay sent the faculty a plan outlining how administrators will implement recommendations in the report.
Asked about the proportion of faculty members who feel a colleague has been unjustly denied tenure, Gay said in an interview last month the FAS’ Tenure-Track Review Committee has worked to make the tenure process more transparent and balanced.
“We want to ensure that the tenure track faculty that we recruit to Harvard are well supported in their work, have clear expectations about their role, are mentored properly, and that at critical moments of review — whether at the level of the associate review or the tenure review — we bring all of the information that we need to bear in order to develop a very comprehensive and balanced view of the teaching, research, and service record of our colleagues,” she said.
More than half of survey respondents were ambivalent about the changes to the tenure process, reporting that they neither support nor oppose the modifications. On the contrary, just over 39 percent of respondents indicated they either strongly or somewhat support the changes, while less than 10 percent indicated they either strongly or somewhat oppose them.
More ladder faculty supported the tenure process changes than did non-ladder faculty. Over 58 percent of ladder faculty respondents indicated they either strongly or somewhat support the changes, while 18 percent of non-ladder faculty respondents indicated support. Nearly three-quarters of non-ladder faculty respondents indicated they neither support nor oppose the changes to the tenure review process.
Though many other universities grant tenure at the associate professor level, Harvard grants tenure only at the full professor level. Just over 34 percent of respondents indicated they strongly or somewhat agree with Harvard’s practice, while about 39 percent said they strongly or somewhat disagree, and 27 percent indicated they neither agree nor disagree.
In the May interview, Gay said she encourages people with concerns about Harvard’s practice to read the Tenure-Track Review Committee’s report, which recommended maintaining the current tenure timeline and granting tenure only at the full professor rank.
Survey respondents were also divided over Harvard’s use of confidential ad hoc committees convened by the University president or provost that help make a final decision in a tenure case.
Just over 33 percent of respondents indicated they strongly or somewhat agree with the use of ad hoc committees, while 35 percent indicated they strongly or somewhat disagree.
Responding to an open-ended question asking for feedback on changes made to the FAS’ tenure review process, many faculty wrote that the process should be made more transparent. Some also wrote that it was disappointing the new implementation plan did not address concerns regarding ad hoc committees.
One faculty member wrote that “the ad hoc process remains a mystery and a source of stress.”
Gay said the implementation plan for the Tenure-Track Review Committee’s recommendations seeks to give department chairs more information on the ad hoc committees and the Committee on Appointments and Promotions, which advises the FAS dean on whether to forward a case to the University president.
“One of the things that we’re doing as part of our implementation is creating more opportunities for feedback — in particular to department chairs after both the CAP discussion and ad hoc final decision — that we hope will provide department chairs with more information that they can use to prepare future cases for review,” she said.
Among the 476 respondents to The Crimson’s survey, 198 faculty respondents in the FAS identified themselves as non-ladder faculty — who will never be considered for tenure at Harvard. Non-tenure-track faculty include lecturers, senior lecturers, preceptors, senior preceptors, professors of the practice, and visiting scholars.
Nearly 70 percent of non-ladder faculty respondents said they either strongly or somewhat disagree that the FAS provides enough support for non-tenure-track faculty in their department.
Just 20 percent of non-ladder faculty said they either strongly or somewhat agree that the FAS provides enough support for non-tenure-track faculty in their department.
While most non-ladder respondents said they have not received adequate support from the FAS, most ladder respondents feel supported by the school. Nearly 65 percent of ladder faculty somewhat or strongly agree the FAS provides enough support for tenured or tenure-track faculty in their department.
In addition, more than 66 percent of non-ladder faculty reported feeling their compensation is “too low” or “far too low,” while just less than 31 percent of ladder faculty reported the same.
Non-tenure-track faculty — who have time-capped appointments — have long raised concerns about job insecurity. Preceptor appointments last eight years, while most lecturer appointments last three.
Gay said non-ladder faculty play “a very important role” in fulfilling Harvard’s “teaching mission,” referring to multiple reviews the FAS has conducted of non-ladder appointments. The most recent one affirmed the time-cap system for preceptors.
In response to an open-ended question asking whether there were specific aspects of their department that need to change, some respondents said time caps for non-ladder faculty appointments created anxiety around employment.
“Anxious teachers and colleagues take away from a flourishing work culture,” one respondent wrote.
For its 2022 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from April 11 to 26, 2022. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in March 2022 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty.
Of those faculty, 492 faculty members accessed the link, and 476 participants answered at least one question. A total of 333 participants fully completed the survey.
To check for potential response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, race and ethnicity, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, the respondents to the survey were in line with the demographics of the broader faculty.
Of survey respondents, 42 percent identified themselves as women, and 25 percent identified themselves as faculty of color. Based on data in the 2021 FAS Dean’s Annual Report, women and faculty of color make up 39 and 26 percent of FAS faculty, respectively.
According to the report, 42 percent of the FAS are senior non-ladder, non-ladder, or visiting faculty. Among the respondents to The Crimson’s faculty survey, 49 percent indicated that they are non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 140 — or 12 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 7 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.
