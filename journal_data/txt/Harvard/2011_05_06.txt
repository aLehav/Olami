After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 1, the Columbia Senate, a legislative body composed of student, faculty, and administration, voted 51-17 to begin negotiations with the military about bringing ROTC back to campus. Yale College recently created a faculty committee to investigate the program’s return to campus, which will “seek student input.” Stanford University’s Ad Hoc Committee on ROTC has also fostered discussion on Stanford’s campus, and a non-binding question on ROTC’s presence at Stanford appeared on the spring election ballot last month.
In contrast, at Harvard, President Drew Faust simply announced on March 3 that she would welcome Naval ROTC back onto campus. She not only failed to adequately acknowledge that students, staff, and faculty might oppose its return but also provided no forum for discussion about the extent of ROTC recognition and has publically explained very little about the decision.
The issue of ROTC on campus requires an informed and transparent decision-making process. Despite historical precedent, Harvard’s 2011 decision to “reinstate” ROTC was neither of these.
In the past, our university has made decisions about ROTC only after seriously considering student and faculty opinion. Responding to student concerns about Harvard’s engagement with the military during the Vietnam War, a faculty panel met to debate removing course credit and space allocation for ROTC. Another panel met  in the 1990s to address ROTC in the context of anti-gay discrimination.
However, in 2011, the faculty took no vote, and students had no forums for discussion. Now, more than a month after President Faust announced ROTC’s return, the Harvard community still knows little about the process of negotiations or the terms of the deal.
The Harvard administration must not be the sole voice dictating Harvard’s policy toward ROTC. Not only does President Faust fail to represent the diversity of opinion in the student body, but as the president of a university that stands to gain public approval from recognizing ROTC, she may have external motivation for facilitating ROTC’s return.
Many students remain concerned about ROTC’s continued violation of Harvard’s anti-discrimination policy. As Samuel Bakkilla ’12 and Jia Hui Lee ’12 wrote in the Crimson, the military forbids transgender individuals from serving openly, and Harvard’s anti-discrimination policy promises to protect members of our community from discrimination based on “gender identity.”
Three days before the public announcement of NROTC’s return, a group of students from the Harvard Trans Task Force met with Faust’s staff and Dean Evelynn Hammonds to discuss ROTC’s violation of the anti-discrimination policy. One of us was present at the meeting, and he noted that the administration’s representatives were apparently not aware of the military’s policy against transgender individuals. The representatives told the students, who were not informed the program would be re-recognized later that week, to direct their concerns to a Naval official instead of the Harvard administration.
While President Faust signed an agreement officially welcoming NROTC back to campus, we participated in an impromptu protest outside. As we packed up to leave, President Faust came out to speak to the protestors. She acknowledged that she “heard us” and recognized our concerns, but still offered no way for us to officially present our objections to the Harvard community.
Some might object to a student referendum on ROTC on the grounds that the non-discrimination policy is not subject to debate. We agree; however, as many in the Harvard community remain ignorant about the military’s discrimination and the administration fails to uphold its own policy, open discussion is necessary to educate the community and protect the non-discrimination policy.
Discussion of ROTC’s violation of the anti-discrimination policy has provided the most vocalized objection to its presence on campus; however, other concerns exist. Students may feel uncomfortable with Harvard University’s decision to assume all costs involved in NROTC and pay an administrator for the program. Students, faculty, staff, and donors who object to the U.S. military’s history of sexual assault, abuse of power, or necessary and institutional complicity in unjust conflicts may not want their tuition money supporting such a system. International students, who do not pay taxes to the US government and may come from countries not allied with the United States, may also hold objections. These concerns need a forum for discussion.
But President Faust has already signed a document “bringing back” NROTC. She has not only made a conclusive step in the recognition of ROTC on Ivy League campuses but also set an impressive precedent for other universities like Columbia and Stanford. What can be done now?
President Faust can, and should, ask students and faculty members for their input, now and in the future. Crucially, she must conduct a more thorough investigation of ROTC’s violation of the anti-discrimination policy and reconsider recognition on the basis of student opinion and discrimination.
Furthermore, as we remain skeptical of the administration’s objectivity on the decision to reinstate ROTC, we demand a public review or disclosure of the terms of Harvard’s deal with Naval ROTC. This information will not only inform students on Harvard’s campus but also provide grounds for discussion on other campuses.
While President Faust may have wished to set a precedent by making Harvard the first Ivy League school to reinstate a ROTC branch after the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, fast and uniformed action must never outweigh the importance of community opinion and implications on civil and human rights. Harvard’s nontransparent and unprecedented decision is unacceptable and demands immediate reconsideration.
CORRECTION: May 8, 2011
An earlier version of this article in both the print and online editions misspelled the name of the Dean of Harvard College. She is Evelynn Hammonds, not Evelyn Hammonds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The question of what role undergraduates ought to have in University decision making is a contentious issue.  Currently there exist a handful of committees which, at least nominally, incorporate students into the decision-making process.  The Committee on Student Life, led by Dean of the College, Evelynn M. Hammonds, discusses pertinent undergraduate issues like alcohol policy, hot breakfast, and final clubs.  It meets regularly and stands out as an effective channel of administrator-student communication.  Student Advisory Boards, on the other hand, have ceased meeting altogether and failed in their mission of allowing students to advise deans on academic issues.  The Educational Policy Committee, which makes crucial decisions such as approving secondary fields, includes two students, yet these students are appointed by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and the proceedings are not public. The Commission of Inquiry is charged with resolving serious problems outside the purview of the FAS. Yet, it meets less than annually and runs on no schedule whatsoever. There is currently not one forum that allows elected student representatives to weigh-in on University-wide decisions in a direct manner.
It is clear that most students would like to see an end to this unilateral approach in the administration’s handling of contentious issues.  The Undergraduate Council, one visible channel for affecting change, is perpetually under fire for alleged irrelevance and inability to meaningfully improve the Harvard student’s experience.  In light of the stagnant relationship between students and the administration, the UC, led by President Senan Ebrahim, have proposed the Harvard University Forum for Change.
Meeting twice a semester, this forum would be composed of faculty, administrators and students.  Each constituency would be allotted time to speak about relevant issues and be heard by the other groups.  HUFC would also serve as a multilateral channel of communication through which the administration could explain its actions to students, who could in turn voice their concerns.  We at the Crimson endorse this effort, with the hopes that it will give students more of a say in major university policy changes.
When it comes to complicated challenges like getting the administration to listen to students regarding contentious university policy decisions, it is important to be open to new and creative solutions.  Given that HUFC would entail only a handful of hours a year from the president and other top administrators, the administration should welcome the new committee. There is undeniably a failure in communication between students and the administration, and this good faith attempt at solving the problem ought to be taken seriously by all who have a stake in our community’s success.
This issue is important because Harvard ought to be a participatory community.  This is not to say that policy decisions must be handled in a democratic manner—we fully recognize the necessity of a hierarchical administrative structure—yet there must be forums for concerned parties to voice their concerns to those with their hands at the helm.  Princeton, Brown, and the University of Pennsylvania all have committees composed of students, faculty, and administrators that offer recommendatory votes on important policy issues. HUFC promises to provide an similar institutional framework that allows for open dialogue and discussion between University constituencies.
Since there have been several attempts made to ameliorate the poor state of communication between students and administrators, many will likely be skeptical about the success chances of HUFC.  And it is certainly possible that it will go down as another well-intentioned effort to resolve a perennial problem.  Yet, we urge the administration to seriously consider the proposal and approach it with good faith.  It is true that many of our peer institutions adopted such proposals in 1969, but when it comes to dealing with problems as fundamental as student-administrator relations, late is always better than never.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Partyin’, Partyin’. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun.”  Let’s not kid ourselves—at some point in the last month or so we had the infamous lyrics of teenage wannabe diva Rebecca Black stuck in our heads.  You most probably also heard other musical masterpieces such as “My Jeans” by Jenna Rose or “I’m Zack” by Zachary Freiman. The whimsical lyrics, although inane and, quite frankly, obnoxious, were innocent if we consider them outside of Charlie Sheen’s definition of partying. Despite the temporary deafness induced by such “music” videos and their auto-tuned singers, the words remain harmless.
A new video, however, has changed that.  Twelve-year-old Jenna Rose released a second song, OMG, following the success of her initial video (though with 7.5 million views on Youtube, she’s clearly no Rebecca Black).  But this time, instead of warbling on about a trivial wardrobe crisis, she disturbingly portrays herself as a so-called “Teen Boom Boom Doll.” The craze of fame-seeking, Bieber-imitating, overzealous teenagers is all right as long as a certain line isn’t crossed. Jenna Rose, however, has crossed that line.
In the video, Rose is dancing provocatively to lyrics that say, “You know that you want to/You know that you need to/It will last longer for you.”  Did I mention she’s 12?  The lyrics continue: “Oh my God, she looks good/Oh my God, you know you wish you could.” Did I mention how 12 she is?
While these lyrics might be fine in a Lady Gaga song (though they’re probably not meta enough) or maybe a Britney comeback song (though they might not be egocentric enough), they definitely shouldn’t be part of a 12-year-old’s repertoire since they only add to the premature titillation and sexualization of adolescent youth in America.
This may be indicative of a larger trend in pop music.  From Miley Cyrus’ “Can’t be Tamed” to everything new piece in Ke$ha’s ouvre, song lyrics have explored the gory details of the physical, the sensual, and the sexual to popular acclaim.  Yet it is unsettling that pre-teenage girls think that such lyrical depravity is their only chance at fame.  What is even more unnerving is that the parents of many such teenagers seem to be fine with it.
Rose’s video is probably not the only example of hyper-sexualized adolescent years, which makes it worrisome that such a music style is becoming a trend among teenagers.  Willow Smith’s “Whip My Hair” video, although on a totally different artistic level, includes themes that are not appropriate to an 11- year-old with lyrics such as “I gets it in hmm yeah, I go hard.”  I’m not suggesting that everything that airs on the radio ought to be G-rated, but kids in their early teens need not emulate the questionable styles of our current pop stars.
OMG still has some quirky lyrics á la Black, but it reveals a desperate teenager in search of fame. Rose’s misguided attempt might be due to the poor array of role models and the eagerness of her parents. Her claim to fame, however, should not be based on a quasi-erotic “music” video.
Yet, there’s still time for her to redress this lyrical faux pas.  Hopefully, her next song will go easy on the auto-tune too.

Part of the problem with being a columnist—and a Harvard student—is that you have such an aggressive focus on the fleeting that you often forget to step back and remember what actually matters in the grand scheme of things.
There’s no shortage of religion topics I could write about to round off the semester, but most of those headlines won’t matter a few months from now. Like that Gen Ed course you’ve been slacking on or that 25-page paper you’ve barely started researching, these things tend to get subsumed with the ebb and flow of time. Years from now, when you look back on your Harvard experience while pursuing your calling in the world, a letter on a piece of paper will matter much less than you think it will. In our stress-filled pressure cooker of a university, we would do well, every once in a while, to take a break for a moment and regain some perspective.
So for my last column of the semester, before I and everyone else on this campus burrows themselves into Lamont for the day, I want to talk about a baby.
His name is Yehuda Shmuel (Judah Samuel), and he’s just under three weeks old. He has a full head of hair and a mischievous smile when the light strikes him properly. He was circumcised and named two weeks ago at the Hillel, as the first child of Rabbi Ben Greenberg and Rabbanit Sharon, the Orthodox rabbinic advisors.
Over tuna salad, pastries, and matzah—it was Passover, after all—the glowing couple reiterated their love for each other in front of a room full of friends and family. Ashkenazi Jews have a custom of naming children after relatives who have passed on, and Yehuda Shmuel bears the name of four of his ancestors, two on each side of Ben and Sharon’s family. It’s a beautiful custom. Through his name, Yehuda becomes a part of a legacy greater than he could possibly imagine, and a testament to the cyclical nature of life. He holds names that have been passed on for generations, and will God willing be passed on for generations to come.
I’ve seen Yehuda quite a few times over the past number of weeks, and somehow it’s hard to stay stressed about work while watching him fall asleep in his mother’s snuggie. Sometimes it takes the awed reaction of a newborn to things that had long become mundane to you to force you to take your myopic focus off deadlines for a second and consider the big picture.
So consider this: When was the last time we simply let ourselves relax for a moment and smile over the fact that we’re young and have our entire lives ahead of us? That we live in a world of incredible beauty beyond the meaningless idiosyncrasies of the world that we establish for ourselves on this campus? When was the last time we called a parent or a sibling and just had a conversation? When was the last time we exhaled and reminded ourselves that there’s more to life than what we see around us now?
The day after Yehuda’s circumcision, instead of going back to work after hitting the gym, I went down to the Charles and just sat on the grass. The weather was stunning. A family of four sat and ate sandwiches on a picnic spread while their young daughter ran in the sun. A young couple sat on a blanket in each other’s arms a few feet away from an elderly couple, watching the ducks float by across the river. Time slowed for a moment as I considered the currents of life around me.
And for one fleeting moment, I remembered why I came here in the first place.

When Kim Smith—the CEO of Bellwether Educational Partners, an education non-profit—took charge after her fellow Girl Scouts’ canoe tipped over during a trip in her childhood, she says she didn’t receive the gratitude she expected. Instead, her friends told her, “You’re so bossy!”
Smith, along with Deborah M. Jewell-Sherman, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Nannerl O. Keohane, a professor at Princeton University, invoked stories from childhood during an Ed School panel on Wednesday titled “Does Gender Matter in Education Leadership?”
All three panelists said they had been mistaken for a secretary in their lives, demonstrating, they said, how being a female shaped the way the world viewed their abilities as leaders.
Kathleen McCartney, dean of the Ed School and the panel’s moderator, followed up on Smith’s story and asked, “Is bossy a word you would use for a boy?” The panel replied no, and Keohane said, “There’s a connotation that girls are not supposed to be bossy.”
Smith said that only 20 percent of women fill superintendent roles, as opposed to the 80 percent of women in the teaching workforce.  Keohane, who formerly served as the president of Wellesley College and as the first female president of Duke University, said that even without the gender imbalance there aren’t enough strong applicants applying for top education positions.
“We need the talent, and having people excluded because of their gender, to me, is a crying shame,” she said.
Keohane discussed her personal story as a teaching assistant at Yale University, where she received her Ph.D.: when her students (who were all male) lined up for office hours, one immediately cried out, “Oh no, it’s a girl.” Keohane said her undergraduate experience at Wellesley helped her to deal with the situation.
She said that people also questioned her abilities as a female president at Duke.
Jewell-Sherman said that changing the field of education leadership would require giving women an experience like Keohane’s—one in which young women are empowered.
“The stereotypes of women as ‘bossy,’ as well as some other words that start with ‘b’ but aren’t as kind, are infused in young people and have irreparable damage for the psyche of young women and young men as they perceive the leadership of women,” she said.
“We’re socialized to do the work,” Jewell-Sherman continued, “but not to want to be front and center.”

Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s endowment, announced yesterday that it has hired John Devir, a former managing director and head of equity strategies at Barclays Capital, as its managing director of stocks in developed markets.
Devir marks the Harvard Management Company’s third senior hire in the past year, following the group’s decision to hire Satu Parikh, its managing director of commodities and former global head of commodities at Lehman Brothers, and Rene Canezin, the former managing director and head of U.S. credit and global high yield trading at Barclays.
“John brings extensive experience of equity markets in the Americas and Europe to Harvard’s internal investment team,” Head of Internal Management Stephen Blyth said in a statement yesterday.
“His insight and knowledge will complement Harvard Management Company’s talented group of portfolio managers across public markets.”
The additions follow several departures from the fund management team, but the Harvard Management Company has previously said that these hires are not to fill holes but to acquire talented investors.
In her 2010 Annual Report, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said that “the environment for attracting investment talent and experience to HMC has been favorable over the last two years and we have taken advantage of this opportunity.”
“Recognizing that staff will change over time, our approach is to continue to build depth in each of our teams and to install leadership that is not only extremely well-qualified, but is also committed to Harvard over the long term. HMC is well known for providing valuable experience and training which allows us to regularly hire best-in-class talent,” she wrote.
HMC last fall reported positive annual investment returns across all asset classes, totaling 11 percent.
The increase in returns boosted the endowment value 5.4 percent, from $26 billion to $27.4 billion, increasing the nominal value of funds allocated from the endowment to schools by 4 percent.
Last fall’s returns represented a rebound from the 27.3 percent drop the endowment suffered following the financial crisis of 2008, beating the long-term 8.25 percent annual returns HMC has set as a goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked to recount the events that transpired yesterday midnight in Harvard Yard, her answer was simple: “We just got naked, and we ran.”
Madison L. Coveno ’14 was one of a group of about 100 Harvard undergraduates who dropped their books and, more importantly, their clothes to commemorate the first day of final exams with a brisk trot around the Yard.
As the Harvard Band, stationed in front of the John Harvard statue as usual, played boisterous tunes, participants in the semiannual Harvard tradition known as “Primal Scream” sped past a horde of curious onlookers. One student ran in a hamburger suit, several rolled past on skateboards, and a few brought up the rear with cigars hanging from their mouths.
In the minutes leading up to midnight, students gathered and lingered between Stoughton Hall and Hollis Hall. When the time came, articles of clothing were flung aside, and a fleshy mass began its circular course.
“It’s a rite of passage, and it’s f—ing invigorating,” said Luke M. Baran ’11, upon finishing his sprint. “I just bookended my college career: I did it freshman fall and my senior spring. It feels like I’ve come full circle.”
With its clear skies and cool weather, last night was far more gentle on the skin than December’s rainy and windy Primal Scream. But in comparison to last night’s jaunt, the fall saw greater participation numbers—and more excitement and bedlam.
Coveno said that she preferred fall semester’s Primal Scream, recalling how the slippery conditions actually helped to up the excitement factor.
She said she plans to participate again in the future.
“It’s a tradition—you have to do it,” she said. “It’s one of those weird things. You can’t not do it.”
Along the starting line near Hollis and around the John Harvard statue stood a crop of fully clothed spectators—some even from outside of the gates of Harvard.
“We were just curious,” said Leo Li, a Taiwanese exchange student at Northeastern University, as he stood with his camera and a group of male friends.
“We just want to see naked lady,” he said, calling the events “crazy.”
Onlooker Manfredi Caltagirone, a student at the Kennedy school, said that he appreciated the spirit of Primal Scream and had encouraged his peers at school to participate as well—to no avail.
“I would have loved to have done it if I had gotten that group,” he said.
Primal Scream, which occurs at the end of reading period every semester, allegedly first took shape in the 1960s, when students blew off steam the night before final exams by yelling from their dormitory windows for 10 minutes. In the 1990s, students adapted the tradition by incorporating streaking.
Alongside urinating on the John Harvard statue and having sex in the stacks of Widener Library, Primal Scream is one of the three tasks that Harvard students should complete before graduation, according to undergraduate lore.
Baran may have scratched Primal Scream off his list, but he has his sights set higher.
“I’m trying to do all three in one night, but I don’t know if that’s going to happen,” he said with a laugh.

On the heels of Sunday’s dramatic assassination of Osama bin Laden, two American military experts expressed concern that bin Laden’s death would spark violent retaliatory attacks against the United States at a panel Wednesday at the Institute of Politics.
“There is likely to be a threat spike in the next weeks and months because Al Qaeda will be trying to avenge the leader’s death as well as prove that they are still a viable organization,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former American intelligence officer and senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
In the coming weeks, Mowatt-Larssen said that the U.S. will be engaged in a “race against time” to take advantage of a trove of intelligence that was collected at bin Laden’s hideout in Pakistan before Al Qaeda changes its operations.
Some critics of the Obama administration have raised questions about the legality of Sunday’s operation, which was conducted without the knowledge of Pakistani officials. But Robert W. Kinder, a former senior advisor for the International Security Assistance Force and current student at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that the U.S. has sent a strong message to other countries that if a target is sufficiently important it is willing to set aside concerns over violating a country’s sovereignty and launch a strike.
“I think that a precedent has been set,” Kinder said. “If the stakes are high enough, the U.S. can send a group of soldiers in with or without Pakistan’s permission.”
But Mowatt-Larssen said that the search for bin Laden was a very specific case and one that the decision to launch the strike was not taken lightly by the Obama administration.
“There is this image of the U.S. cowboy flouting international law, but these are very hard decisions. You are putting your own people at risk, and it’s really a last resort. The default is to work collaboratively whenever possible,” Mowatt-Larssen said.
Beyond the current terror threat, all of the panelists raised concerns about the future of U.S.-Pakistani relations after the killing of bin Laden.
Wajahat Khan, a Pakistani journalist and fellow at the Joan Shorenstein Center, warned against the dangers of the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan with the expectation that domestic political actors would resolve internal tensions. Khan said the U.S. followed such a strategy to disastrous results when it shifted attention away from Afghanistan in the 1980s after aiding local forces—including bands led by bin Laden—wage a successful guerilla campaign against the Soviet Union.
“All of this started when [the U.S.’s] disengagement with that part of the world started,” Khan said. “Leaving Pakistan in charge of Afghanistan in the eighties is analogous to leaving a heroine addict in charge of the drug dealer.”
As the relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan becomes more complex, Khan said that there is a possibility of Pakistan growing closer to China. Khan said that the Pakistani military, which views itself as a caretaker of the Pakistani state and wields significant influence with the government, has grown frustrated with American policymakers who, he said, have shifted their policies between presidential administrations.
“The Chinese have succeeded where the Americans have failed,” Khan said. “Americans have an in-built inconsistency because of their democratic setup because their policies have to change ... The Chinese have been more consistent.”
Students said that after hearing the panelists, they were concerned about the future of U.S.-Pakistan relations.
“I think this will lead to a huge blow to the trust between the two countries,” said Erum K. Sattar, a student at the Law School. “And trust is the bedrock of any relationship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clusters of frantic undergraduates study in the Lamont Library Cafe, while their peers dance to Lady Gaga in cramped dorm rooms and still others chat over cereal in House dining halls.
To work, socialize, and party, Harvard students must physically disperse, moving from one social space to another.
While undergraduates at other colleges flock to one student center, no such central space exists at Harvard.
Students and administrators acknowledge that the issue of social space is central to the Harvard undergraduate experience. Many agree that the campus’s current social space offerings are lacking, and with the recent efforts of groups like the Harvard Students for Safe Space, Harvard’s social space has again come under scrutiny as students repeatedly raise complaints about the issue.
But each Harvard undergraduate has an individual definition of social space—some want to socialize with friends in smaller casual areas while others focus on the weekend evening party scene.
As students continue to complain and administrators respond with solutions of varying success, the question becomes—what exactly is missing from on-campus social space at Harvard?
WHAT IS SOCIAL SPACE?
The definition of social space varies from person to person, both among students and among administrators, who acknowledge students’ varied needs but sometimes fail to provide spaces that undergraduates find useful.
Administrators recognize that students have a broad range of needs in terms of social space, and over the past decade Harvard has allocated a significant amount of money and resources to making additional social space available to undergraduates.
But the spaces that the school has chosen to develop in the recent past—like the Student Organization Center at Hilles and Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub—often fall short of student needs, many students say.
For example, administrators point to Lamont Cafe as an example of a recent success, but some students say that the semi-social study space fails to live up to their definitions of a social space.
“I don’t know many people that are like, ‘Oh, I’m going to go chill in Lamont Cafe,” says Molly E. Dektar ’12.
Andy Balbuena ’12 says that for him, the Eliot House dining hall—a place to talk and see his friends—is enough.
“It’s where I go to hang out. Where people go to talk and socialize,” Balbuena says of social space.
House Masters say that there are many House spaces that allow for casual conversation among students.
But other students look to the alcohol-induced fraternizing of cramped dorm parties for their social fix.
In its Report on Harvard House Renewal released in 2009, the House Program Planning Committee defined social space as places like “dining halls, grilles, small group study rooms, meeting rooms for student organizations, JCRs, Masters’ Residences, fitness rooms and athletic facilities” and recommended the creation of more such spaces.
But House Renewal—slated to begin in June of 2012 with Old Quincy—could take more than a decade to complete and remains a long-term solution.
For those who take issue with Harvard social space, no matter their definition of the problem, they are united on one thing—the social space problem is an obstacle to Harvard social life.
“It’s become one of the limiting reagents in the Harvard experience,” Undergraduate Council President Senan Ebrahim ’12 says.
IMPROVING EXISTING SPACE
Students and administrators—although they voiced various complaints about social space—largely expressed an interest in reutilizing existing spaces in Houses and the Yard.
Administrators say that better utilizing currently available ares is the immediate solution to the social space problem.
“We want to continue to evaluate current spaces as well as identify new spaces in an effort to effectively meet the social and programmatic needs of students,” says Assistant Dean for Student Life David R. Friedrich.
Some students echo the sentiments of administrators, calling for better utilization of the rooms that currently exist in Harvard’s Houses.
“I think that there’s a lot of social space in the Houses that maybe could be used more or used better,” says Anne G. Douglas ’12, Adams House Committee co-chair.
Student organization leaders, who say that it is often difficult to find on-campus space for events, agree that restrictions on some House rooms that are available only to House members are to blame in part for the apparent lack of social space.
“It’s completely feasible to open these spaces up,” says Jonathan L. Newmark ’12, president of the Harvard College Democrats.
Students also complain about a lack of social space during freshman year in particular.
Upperclassmen benefit from House life, but without that centralized social scene, many freshmen say that they have difficulty finding activities for weekend nights.
A survey conducted in December by the Freshman Dean’s Office revealed that a lack of social space is a primary concern among first-year students.
The Freshman Space Working Group—a collection of students and administrators formed earlier this school year to address concerns with freshman social space—recommended, among other things, that the College renovate the common rooms of freshman dorms and that Annenberg Dining Hall remain open for longer hours, giving freshmen another space in which to socialize.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds is currently reviewing their recommendations and any planned changes to freshman social space have yet to be finalized.
THE DESIRE TO DRINK
Other students search for easier access to alcohol and greater availability of events with alcohol, a desire that the administration may never be able to meet.
“I think the biggest problem is that we don’t have a place of our own, away from our proctors and away from school regulations,” says John Kye ’14.
Administrators recognize that some percentage of Harvard students see socializing as intoxicated partying and seek a large on-campus venue in which to replicate the atmosphere of parties that take place in cramped dorm rooms.
But despite student pleas for a school-sanctioned on-campus party space, administrators say that the type of social space that those Harvard students are asking for is impossible for them to provide.
“We can’t be a refuge from the laws of the Commonwealth,” Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said during a March interview on the results of the FDO’s freshman survey. That survey revealed a desire among freshmen for a more lenient alcohol policy in the Yard, where alcohol is banned from dorms entirely.
“The biggest problem I have with the Harvard social scene is that freshman guys don’t have enough space to throw down our own parties,” Kye says. “A couple of times me and my roommates wanted to throw down in our own room and we got busted by our proctors.”
STUDENT CENTER
Still other students ask for the creation of new casual social space. For decades, this desire for new space has manifested itself in calls for an on-campus student center—a central building for on-campus social life.
Brian I. Choi ’13 says that he sees a student center as “a place where students are actually comfortable hanging out in.”
“I don’t think students at Harvard have a space for that,” says Choi, also a Crimson photo editor.
Students say that although Harvard may intend for Houses to be “microcosms of the College,” they often want to meet students outside of their Houses.
“It’s a very segregated situation now where people meet in their own dining hall and you really don’t meet people outside of your House,” Balbuena says.
Despite repeated attempts by the administration to create a student center, the lack of such a building remains a permanent obstacle to Harvard social life, some students say.
“This is like the student center on campus,” Ebrahim says, pointing around the crowded room of Lamont Cafe. “And that’s a problem.”
University President Drew G. Faust has said that she hopes to see the creation of more common space for students, faculty, and staff, citing the lower floors of the Holyoke Center as one possible option.
According to Faust, the funding for the creation of a student center is being considered as a possible goal of the upcoming capital campaign.
“My goal would be to find a space where everybody could have shared interactions during the daytime and then at night it would belong to the undergraduates,” Faust says.
‘A LOT OF OPTIONS’
Despite these concerns, many students say that although the Harvard social scene may have its flaws, ultimately they have been satisfied with their experience.
“I never felt like I wanted something that wasn’t available,” says Luke L. Sperduto ’11.
Many students say that overall they were happy with Harvard’s social life, and only articulate minor problems with it.
“A social space is a place where you can hang out with your friends or party or something,” says Kevin A. Chenault ’14. “You might have to look for it, but I think there’s a lot of options.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Student Labor Action Movement has kicked off its sustainable jobs campaign to rally student support for University dining hall workers who will be re-negotiating their contracts in the coming year.
The campaign comes a week before Unite Here! Local 26, the union for Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Hall Services workers, plans to submit its contract proposal to the University.
For the campaign, SLAM has placed posters across campus that state SLAM’s demands for Harvard workers, which include greater job security and more access to full-time employment.
“Harvard needs to be providing its workers with sustainable jobs,” said SLAM member Karen A. Narefsky ’11. “[That] means jobs with full-time hours, jobs workers can sustain their livelihoods and their families’ livelihoods with. Jobs which allow them to lead full, happy, and productive lives,” Narefsky said.
The campaign links Harvard’s emphasis on sustainability, as seen with the University’s Green campaign, to sustainable jobs for workers, a tactic that Unite Here! formulated in its current negotiations with the University.
SLAM’s first event for the sustainable jobs campaign will be a Unite Here! member meeting for workers on May 12 at 8 p.m. in the First Parish Church in Cambridge. SLAM members hope to raise student awareness about the event and said that a strong attendance would help workers in their negotiations.
“Everyone should go,” said SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14.
“If we can send a strong message to the University, they’ll be less likely to cut wages and reduce hours.”
SLAM members also said they are prepared to push the campaign further.
“We’re not sure yet exactly where this campaign is going to go, but we do plan to escalate if we don’t get a positive response from Harvard,” Narefsky said.
Local 26 President Brian Lang said he welcomed SLAM’s endorsement.
“They’ve expressed support for our sustainable jobs campaign, which is the centerpiece for our proposals in these contract negotiations,” Lang said.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said that the University is committed to finding a workable solution for both sides.
“The people who work at Harvard University Dining Services are vital members of our community and we value the work that they do,” he wrote. “We are hopeful that an open and constructive dialogue will lead to an agreement that benefits both the Dining Services staff and the rest of the Harvard community.”
SLAM members said that while the immediate focus of the sustainable jobs campaign are the Unite Here! Workers’ contract negotiations, they will extend the campaign through the summer and into the fall when the security guards and custodial workers will be re-negotiating their contracts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Nell S. Hawley ’11 arrived at an international boarding high school nestled in the foothills of India’s Himalayas for her sophomore year, she never expected that in the following months she would grapple with the onset of an eating disorder.
Hawley explored nature through hikes and shopped in bazaars. Her classes were less demanding than those offered by her New York City school, providing her with more time to devote to her friendships. She entered her first steady romantic relationship. “Along with all of this unadulterated joy,” she said, “came a newfound appreciation for food.”
Hiking to and from school each day, her growing appetite was satiated with Indian meals, which she said were abundant and accessible.
“I ate a lot and loved it,” Hawley said. “I noticed my clothes fit me differently, but I shrugged it off and still thought I was beautiful, desirable, smart, funny, et cetera. My self-confidence was through the roof.”
Hawley was unconcerned by her figure until a week-long school historical sightseeing trip to Delhi where one night, as she ate a candy bar, a girl told her, “When you came here you were so thin, but now you’re nice and plump and healthy!”
While Hawley said she recognized that the comment was intended as a compliment, she felt exposed.
“At that moment I saw myself through different eyes, through outside eyes, and I saw myself having too much fun, too much pleasure,” Hawley said. “All of a sudden my independence and happiness became dangerous things; they were things that needed to be curbed and tamed.”
Hawley began to monitor her portions, but after a two-week winter break, her eating issues “spiraled out of control,” setting in motion a vicious cycle of skipping meals, studying compulsively and withdrawing from friends.
“I drank black coffee with sugar for breakfast, skipped lunch, and ate bananas, sometimes oranges, for dinner,” she said. “When I looked in the mirror I didn’t even recognize myself. I slept for 12 hours a night and could barely walk up a flight of stairs.”
Hawley developed anorexia at age 16.
Now 22, Hawley said she has largely recovered through therapy and treatment.
“For the past seven years not a day goes by when I don’t struggle with it. I know how hard it can be,” she said.
While Harvard offers a number of resources for students with eating disorders, including peer counselors and Harvard University Health Services Support staff, the issue is often stigmatized and can slip under the radar.
“You can’t admit it if you’re depressed or struggle with college or are throwing up,” Hawley said. “I don’t want to be anonymous. I do not want people to be ashamed of struggling.”
EATING IN SECRET
Louis R. Evans ’13, a resident of Canaday last year, said he ran downstairs to the bathroom by the Women’s Center one day to find a sign that surprised him. He recalled that it read: “The cleaning staff has reason to believe that someone who used this bathroom has an eating disorder. We encourage you to get in touch with resources.” Below the sign was printed a list of phone numbers.
“It was an odd experience to come face-to-face with the fact that maybe someone I knew was struggling with something,” Evans said. “It’s an issue that I hadn’t been aware of.”
Natalie C. Chapman ’11—a member of the Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach for the past seven semesters—attributes Harvard’s lack of awareness to a sense of social shame that pervades campus.
“It’s more common than people realize but no one talks about it, so how would you know?” Chapman said.
While she could not reveal the number of students who visit ECHO, Chapman said that “it is more than you think, but fewer than it should be.”
MORE THAN FOOD
Megan, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, was a junior in high school when she developed anorexia. While frantically writing her college applications, her school threatened to expel her if she fell below a certain weight. She said that her unhealthy relationship with food exposed her to misconceptions about eating disorders.
“It’s not all about wanting to lose weight and be skinny,” Megan said. “People mistakenly think that if you physically force food into someone you’re fixing the problem. That’s just not true.”
Hawley shared Megan’s observation, saying that her therapy sessions did not discuss eating. Instead, she worked to confront problems without “punishing the body.”
Melissa Henriquez—a recovered disordered eater and a writer for “Let There Be Light,” a blog about disordered eating—says it is common for people to change their eating habits in unhealthy ways to cope with anxiety.
“Instead of dealing with whatever I was dealing with at the moment that I couldn’t control, I’d turn to something I could control,” said Henriquez, referring to food and exercise.
Anna Lucia Lister ’13, an ECHO peer counselor, said that despite what many people think, eating disorders can be complex and deadly conditions.
“Students often don’t appreciate how lethal eating disorders can be,” said Margaret S. McKenna ’70, a psychiatrist at UHS.
She cited mortality rates for anorexia as high as 5 to 10 percent.
Another myth about eating disorders is that they are just a “girl problem,” Lister said.
“I saw a multimedia presentation on male eating disorders—body dysmorphia—which focused on steroid use and obsessive gym use,” Lister said. “There is still stigma attached to men and eating disorders, although it may take a different form, ”
A PERFECTIONIST’S PROBLEM?
Hawley points to the academic and social forces at Harvard as a source of pressure on students to fixate on body image.
“I go to the gym and see girls working out for hours and hours. It’s painful and triggering,” Hawley said. “Academically, socially, and extracurricularly the way to show you have it under control is to be skinny.”
With the day to day stresses of undergraduate life, it can be difficult to find time to “press pause” and deal with an issue.
“Life is so busy here that it’s hard to think and process things,” Megan said. “You’ll put your problem off and deal with this next week when activities die down but time passes and you don’t ask for help.”
Despite comments that Harvard’s Type-A culture facilitates eating disorders, the incidence of eating disorders on Harvard’s campus have been consistent with numbers around the country, according to McKenna.
About 1 percent of students nationally are diagnosed with anorexia and about 3 to 5 percent with bulimia.
Nonetheless, Lister said that at competitive academic institutions, the pressure to achieve perfection is pervasive, and people often feel alone.
“At Harvard everyone is so high-functioning and we have a very skinny campus to begin with, abnormally so,” Lister said. “People feel like if something is going wrong, they’re the only one who’s going through it.”
To reduce such feelings of loneliness, Chapman, the long-time member of the Eating Disorder Hotline, said that the College is taking steps to provide mental health training and information about peer counseling during Freshman Opening Days, where she hopes eating disorders will be addressed.
“Freshman year is a gateway to knowing so much about Harvard. Information you get about resources will stick with you,” Lister said. “People see the posters, but don’t really know about the resources until later in their Harvard careers.”
FINDING A SAFE SPACE
“We have very robust resources to care for students with eating disorders,” said McKenna, referencing the UHS “Eating Disorder Team.”
UHS provides many forms of care, including individual therapy, group therapy, and medical monitoring by a primary care nurse or doctor, according to McKenna.
Aside from UHS and Mental Health Services, Megan said that the Bureau of Study Counsel, where she met with a counselor three times, was a helpful resource.
“The counselor was very non-judgmental and not trying to make me change anything. She just listened, which was a nice change from high school,” Megan said.
In addition to professional resources, Lister says peer counseling groups, all of which are non-directive, provide safe spaces to talk.
“We are open to anything. It can be an eating-specific call that turns into how blocking is terrible and contributing to stress,” Lister said.
“If it affects your stress level and level of happiness here, it could be affecting a disorder.”
While Megan and Hawley noted the value of therapy and eating disorder-specific resources, they said that opening up to people was instrumental in their recovery. Megan says that friends comprise her biggest support network, and Hawley said she found a validating space at Hillel, where she served as president.
“I found people who valued me based on who I am. We see the good and the God in everyone,” Hawley said. “This community looked beyond the body and competition and academic success. They helped me put focus on what makes my life meaningful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As may be expected of students at Harvard, sophomore right-handed pitcher Jordan Haviland is no stranger to honors—he has been a member of three national honor societies, a captain of two different teams, and received accolades nearly every step of the way. But even among his towering trophies and most pristine plaques, the one honor of which Haviland is most proud is the one most people overlook: just getting to play the game.
Two generations down from a strong tradition of baseball, it’s the honor of playing, and not the honors from play, which continues to motivate him.
“I grew up loving the culture of the game,” Haviland said. “Being a part of the family basically meant being a part of baseball.”
Considering his life at home, this comes as all but a surprise. Even at a young age, it didn’t take long for Haviland to catch up on the sport that consumed his household. From the front door to the dinner table, baseball seemed to be the name of the game.
And with a University of Connecticut ballplayer for a father, and an alumni from Cornell’s baseball team for a grandfather, it only seemed right.
Clayton Haviland, Jordan’s grandfather, played as both a catcher and a pitcher for the Big Red for four years, and Tim Haviland, Jordan’s father, spent his college career as an outfielder for the Huskies.
Needless to say, he’s never had a shortage of role models.
“I saw how positive of an influence the sport played in both my dad and grandad’s lives, and that played a huge role,” said Haviland of the examples set by his family. “But, if my dad is the one who taught me to love the game, my brother would have to be the one who taught me to play it. If anyone counts as my role model, it has to be Shawn.”
Having Shawn Haviland, a former Ivy League Pitcher of the Year, for an older brother didn’t hurt.
Joining the Crimson just two years after his sibling’s departure, the older Haviland’s shadow was still very much a presence for his younger brother.
“They definitely started playing baseball from two different points,” senior pitcher Max Perlman said. “Jordan was more traditionally athletic, and Shawn was a very strong kid. Jordan came in as an infielder and a hitter, and Shawn as a pitcher.”
One concentrated in Government, and the other is set on History and Science. Shawn came into college at an imposing 6’ 2”, 185 pounds. His brother? Two inches on the shorter side, and about 10 pounds less to show for it. The older one was known since his sophomore year of high school for throwing a frightening fastball, while the younger one’s always been more of a fan of the knuckle curveball. As Perlman clearly stated, the two are far from being the same person, let alone the same player.
But ultimately, what brings them both together is as simple as what runs through their veins: baseball blood, and ice water.
In a 2005 interview, Harvard coach Joe Walsh noted the then-freshman Shawn Haviland’s cold composure on the mound as his defining characteristic. Six years later, his younger brother is following suit.
“I remember that nothing used to faze Shawn,” Perlman said. “He was incredibly competitive, a real leader, and he would compete with anybody. Jordan definitely has a lot of that same fire.”
The rest of this year’s seniors—the only team members to have played with both brothers—could not agree more.
“Having caught for both Shawn and Jordan, I never really saw either of them get too nervous or flustered,” captain Tyler Albright said. “You always knew when you put the ball in their hands, they were going to compete and give their best efforts to help the team.”
So, despite only appearing in three games this year, throwing one inning of one-hit as scoreless relief against Holy Cross, the promise to live up to high expectations is clearly withinHaviland’s reach.
But for the youngest Haviland, success in his family’s favorite game has little to do with meeting predictions, and more to do with keeping tradition.
“More than having any pressure to play well, there’s just always been a lot of support from my family to play the game,” Haviland remarked. “That’s what pushes me to try and keep up with my brother, to work hard in the offseason, and to just get better at playing baseball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some professional athletes are introduced to the sport they come to love before they can even speak.
But Harvard assistant men's volleyball coach Ahmed Ibrahim does not fall into this category. In fact, his path to Harvard is far from ordinary.
Ibrahim’s journey, which included playing 13 years of professional volleyball in Egypt, did not start until he was in high school.
Having to travel home with a friend who practiced volleyball after school, Ibrahim was forced to stay and watch.
“I was sitting there watching the team practice, and the coach turned around and asked me, ‘What are you doing here?’” Ibrahim said. “I said, ‘Oh, I’m just visiting with my friend who’s right there, and I’m just watching. Is that okay?’ ... And then he starts asking me some personal questions like, ‘Have you played sports before? What height are you?’ Things like that. And he said, ‘Well, jump in.’ And I said, ‘Oh, no, I’m good. Thank you.’ He said, ‘No, jump in.’ He kind of ordered it. I was like ‘Ehh, ok.’ So I put my sneakers on. ... I started from there. I took it day by day.”
Fewer than three years after starting to play volleyball seriously, he earned a spot on the Junior Egyptian National Team as a setter. After a few years, Ibrahim was getting a lot of attention from professional Egyptian club teams.
In 1997, Ibrahim began to play for the Semoha National League team. When he first joined the team, the squad was in the third division, Division C.
But just three years later, Ibrahim helped his team make the move up to Division A.
But his list of accomplishments was hardly complete.
He graduated with honors from Suez Canal University, where he majored in physical education with a specialization in volleyball coaching. Ibrahim graduated top 10 in his field, meriting recognition by Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt at the time.
Ibrahim also decided to transfer to the Sharkia National Team in Cairo in 2001, where he stayed until 2006.
After more than a decade in the sport, Ibrahim decided to settle down. As a newlywed with an American wife, Ibrahim ended his professional volleyball career in Egypt to move across the Atlantic to New Jersey.
For two years, Ibrahim worked at Princeton, coaching the women’s club volleyball team and serving as the director of the development of volleyball skills at the Central New Jersey Volleyball Academy.
The acceptance of his wife into Harvard’s Divinity School finally brought Ibrahim to Cambridge.
“When I came here to the school, of course the first thing I looked for was volleyball,” Ibrahim said.
Through a series of contacts, Ibrahim was able to get in touch with the head men’s volleyball coach, Brain Baise. Baise didn’t have a position available for Ibrahim, but he was more than happy to have Ibrahim attend practices.
Ibrahim only ever expected to play a minor role on the team. But in the fall of 2010, Baise asked Ibrahim to help out with the team as a volunteer coach.
Besides family and volleyball, Ibrahim also works as a Quality Control Supervisor for Securitas.
But more people than just the men’s volleyball team know about Ibrahim. One member of the women’s club volleyball team caught wind of his expertise and asked him to fill in the position as head coach for their team. The former Egyptian pro accepted the offer, seeing it as an opportunity to be around the sport he grew to love.
“[Ibrahim’s] methods are kind of different than other coaches’, but he gets the job done,” sophomore middle Justine Plaut said. “But I think we’ve definitely grown as a team since adding [Ibrahim] to our team. He’s really fun, but if we don’t act a certain way he’ll definitely put us in line.”
Currently, Ibrahim coaches two volleyball teams, works for Securitas, and has a wife and daughter to come home to.
“It is a lot of stress doing everything together at one time,” Ibrahim said. “But when you love something, you find the time to do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back to the Future: Part III was the number one box office hit the last time the Harvard men’s lacrosse team won the Ivy League title, in May 1990. Not only were Marty McFly and Dr. Brown in their heyday, but a large portion of the Crimson’s current roster wasn’t even born.
“It’s been a long time, and that’s definitely a big source of motivation for us,” said All-Ivy honorable mention freshman Daniel Eipp, who wasn’t alive when Michael J. Fox drove in the DeLorean. “But to be honest, we really want to win it for ourselves.”
Third-seed No. 17 Harvard (9-5, 3-3 Ivy) will be taking on second-seed No. 15 Penn (8-5, 4-2 Ivy) in the first semifinal of the Ivy League Tournament tonight in Ithaca, N.Y. Host No. 2 Cornell (11-2, 6-0 Ivy) is the heavy favorite and will face four-seed No. 20 Yale (10-3, 3-3 Ivy) in the other semifinal.
The Crimson has never appeared in the Ivy League tournament before and after last Saturday’s win against Yale is currently 1-2 against the field. The winner of the tournament will win an automatic bid to the eight-team NCAA tournament. Despite the stakes, Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 remains unfazed.
“We’re really just taking it one game at a time,” Wojcik said. “We’re not thinking about the implications. The guys are just trying to stay focused and play our game.”
Even with the lower seed, the Crimson maintains a sense of confidence going into the weekend, largely due to its encounters with the three teams who will be playing in upstate New York. Last weekend’s victory at Harvard Stadium over the Bulldogs, 9-5, was dominant, and both of its losses came by only one goal—including a double-overtime thriller against the Quakers on April 16.
“We’re really looking forward to the opportunity of getting another shot at Penn,” Wojcik said. “It was a tough loss, and I feel like we definitely didn’t play up to our potential. If we’re firing on all cylinders, I feel we can definitely beat them.”
If the Crimson is to come away with a victory, it will need stand-out play from its All-Ivy co-captains, senior Dean Gibbons and junior Kevin Vaughan, both of whom had impressive performances against Yale.
“Kevin and Dean both played really well, and we’re going to need to see that again from them this weekend,” Wojcik said. “Last time out against Penn, we didn’t really execute offensively, and that’s going to have to change.”
Implicit in that statement is the assumption that Harvard will hold its own on the defensive end. Sophomore goalie Harry Krieger has a .705 save percentage in the last two games—both Crimson victories.
“Harry’s been on a hot streak in goal lately,” Wojcik said. “He’s been seeing the ball well and really coming up big for us.”
The Quakers are coming off an 11-2 loss at No. 11 Virginia, a game in which their defense appeared to be exposed. Even so, they still have a strong back line, led by All-Ivy senior defenseman Brett Hughes, who is joined by four other Penn All-Ivy honorees, the most in the school’s history.
“They have a good team, but as I said, I think anything can happen,” said Wojcik, who was an assistant with the Quakers for the last two years.
Harvard leads the all-time series with Penn, 42-34-2, but has never faced the squad in a game with such high stakes.
The winner of tonight’s game will face the winner of the other semifinal, between the Big Red and the Bulldogs. Both teams have had strong seasons, and Cornell has a legitimate chance at winning the national title. This marks a very good year for men’s lacrosse in the Ivy League with four teams ranked in the nation’s top 20.
Both semifinal games will be available to watch from home on ESPN3.com, as will the championship game on Sunday.
It will be a tough road for the Crimson to reach the championship, but that’s nothing out of the ordinary for a team that was been involved in six one-goal games this season.
“We’ve been through a lot together,” Eipp said. “No one on the team has had the chance to play in the Ivy League Tournament before, so we’re just going to go out there and try and win it for our seniors.”

Harvard is back for a rematch that couldn’t have been written better. But this time around, it’s the Crimson’s series to lose.
Cornell (27-20-1, 12-7 Ivy) is returning to Soldiers Field to face a Harvard softball team (34-14, 18-2) on a historic run for the 2011 Ivy League Championship Series.
The Big Red was able to slip by the Crimson last season in the 2010 Championship in a one-run win in the third game of the best-of-three series.
“This entire year our main goal was to give our seniors a chance to win another Ivy League championship,” said freshman third baseman Kasey Lange. “For it to be against Cornell, winning it for them would be that much sweeter.”
After crushing Dartmouth last weekend in a four-game series in which Harvard put 37 runs on the board, the Crimson clinched home field advantage and the North Division title.
The Big Red had to win in its series this week against Princeton to remain atop the South Division in order to face Harvard this weekend for the title.
Both teams have had recent success in the Ivy League. Cornell won the championship last year, while the Crimson has won its division four of the last five years.
Harvard has also won the Ancient Eight title five times, most recently in 2007, but it has been unable to get over the hump in the championship series since.
The Crimson is looking to cap off a historic season in which it has garnered an Ivy League-record 18 wins with a title to seal the deal.
“The team has really come together at the right time,” Lange said. “We have been playing really well all season, but as of late our team is definitely playing the best it has all season.”
Harvard is looking to ride the curtails of its defensive and offensive leaders who have shut down opponents and put huge numbers on the scoreboard throughout the season.
Defensively, the Crimson has two dominant pitchers in junior righty Rachel Brown, who is ranked 13th nationally with 274 strikeouts and was last week’s Ivy League Pitcher of the Week, and freshman right-hander Laura Ricciardone, who has consistently kept opponents at bay.
“Our pitching from Rachel and Laura has been outstanding,” Lange said. “Having a pitcher like Rachel who literally shuts down teams allows us to take advantage of opportunities to win ball games.”
Brown has not only been pitching well recently—posting a 0.57 ERA last week in three games—but has also earned 20 wins this year, a new Harvard record.
“We have been playing with a lot of confidence and it has definitely circulated throughout the team,” Brown said. “All the hard work is finally paying off, and the team is peaking at just the right time.”
With strong pitching performances from Ricciardone, who has 12 wins of her own, the Crimson has been able to record a program-best 34 wins this season.
“I have never been on a team before that I have had so much confidence in scoring runs and backing me up,” Brown said. “It takes so much pressure off of me as a pitcher knowing that even if we fall behind early we have the bats to come back.”
Led by the consistent play of both co-captain second baseman Ellen Macadam and Lange, Harvard is putting the pressure on its opponents just to keep up with its high scoring offense.
The Crimson has both the second- and third-best batters in the Ivy League, with Macadam and Lange batting .449 and .436, respectively.
Both of them are breaking records left and right, with Macadam recording 51 runs scored and 74 hits, while Lange’s 20 doubles lead the league and best the previous school record.
Lange is also heating up at the most important time of the year, winning the Ivy League Player of the Week award after having an astounding .688 batting average in the final stretch of the season.
“This weekend, we just have to keep playing like we have been throughout this entire year,” Lange said. “With consistent offense and good pitching we can compete with anyone. Cornell is a challenge we have prepared for all season.”
With Harvard’s pitchers and batters playing at their best going into the Ivy League Championship, Cornell has a challenge ahead as it faces a softball team looking to earn redemption.
