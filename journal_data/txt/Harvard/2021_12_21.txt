As the calendar inches toward the end of the year, I, a Florida girl, revel in the sheer holiday-ness of this time of year at college in the Northeast: from colorful lights and decorations, to a bustling community life (even if we’re only fueled by the adrenaline of final exams), and most of all, the cold weather, which brings warm fires, hot chocolate, scarves, and most importantly, snow. The atmosphere (aside from those imminent finals) is more conducive to holiday spirit than anything I have ever experienced in the sunny, 80 degree Decembers of my childhood — yet something is still missing that keeps me from fully getting into the Christmas spirit: the “Nutcracker.”
I am a junior now, and this is the third year in a row I have not participated in a performance of the “Nutcracker” after a childhood full of the production. While I used to cringe and feel my heart rate pick up in anxiety anytime I heard the music, it now brings me a bittersweet feeling of nostalgia and longing. At first, I was surprised by the strength of my longing for the classic work — certainly it isn’t without its issues. At the forefront of many companies’ minds this year are the severe cultural issues with the work, which travels around the world in the second act. But despite the work needed to eliminate the problematic aspects, the production is still nothing short of magical. It’s visually compelling, the music is stunning and classic, and for dancers, it’s an integral part of life.
But it’s more than the production itself that I miss — it’s everything else that came with it. For one, “Nutcracker” season was when the sense of community among the dancers in the production was at its highest — for nothing brings us together better than miserable weekend rehearsals and delirious long nights at the theater. We also always did our best to bring the holiday cheer into the studio. We’d show up to rehearsals in holiday pajamas, bring themed snacks, and hold dressing room-wide Secret Santa exchanges, which brought energy and festivity to the space despite our being exhausted, stressed, and probably sick. (After months without a break, my immune system was usually on the floor.)
More than the tight-knit community and the merriment of acting out holiday cheer onstage, what really made “Nutcracker” feel like Christmas was the spirit of giving that it exemplified. Though being in the production wasn’t always magical — we were just as often getting yelled at or slipping on stage — seeing the way it brought families together, and the glowing eyes of young children as they walked out of the theater, was the most rewarding thing I have experienced to this day. The effect it had on the children was particularly special — for so many, this was their first exposure to ballet, and seeing kids spinning around in the lobby or having them ask, wide-eyed, to touch my tutu was the best gift I could get. We were part of bringing magic and holiday spirit to the community — through the art that we all loved so much, no less — and though it was grueling, there was nothing better than that to make us feel that Christmas had arrived.
Someday, I will make it back into a production of the “Nutcracker.” For now, I’ll content myself with taking a break from finals to watch the production and be on the receiving end of the gift of Christmas spirit. And as I am transported to the Land of Sweets and I feel the warm glow of the holidays surround me, I’ll remember how lucky I once was to help bring that magic to other people.
— Outgoing Campus and Dance exec Sara Komatsu will be working desperately to create holiday cheer at home in Florida without the New England cold or “Nutcracker” to aid her, and will therefore be unreachable until after Dec. 25. Thereafter she can be found at sara.komatsu@thecrimson.com, where she welcomes any and all dance enthusiasts in her inbox.

The rumors are true. I, Jaden S. Thompson ‘23, was once co-owner of the famed Instagram account @the_dicaprio_girls. When I say famed, I mean that to this day, the account has an impressive 74 followers, despite the fact that the most recent post is over eight years old. Allow me to travel back in time and set the scene for readers who are undoubtedly curious about my elusive history as a DiCaprio girl. Everyone has a past, and this is mine.
It was the winter of 2013. My best friend Zoe and I had developed an inexplicable obsession with Leonardo DiCaprio, who was 26 years our senior — a fact we were frequently reminded of by our parents, teachers, and peers. The infatuation grew from a simple text exchange over “Titanic,” the three hour melodrama that catapulted DiCaprio to fame years before I was even born. I remember typing (on my Samsung Intensity II slide phone) something along the lines of, “Isn’t Jack so cute???” (or perhaps my friend said this; the details are fuzzy. The point is, we agreed that Jack, the free-spirited artist that DiCaprio played, was cute.) Thus began a period of our lives in which both of us abandoned our respective last names in favor of DiCaprio, professed our undying love for him to everyone, and meticulously worked our way through his filmography. As outgoing film exec, I’ll say it — this was a good introduction to the work of Martin Scorsese.
One day, on the bus home from sixth grade, Zoe and I were suddenly struck with inspiration: We would start an Instagram fan account for Leonardo DiCaprio. The extremely clever name we came up with for it? @the_dicaprio_girls. We unabashedly followed everyone we knew from school, as well as other fan accounts for the actor. This was our calling, our middle school magnum opus. @the_dicaprio_girls bio reads, “Hey, it’s Jaden and Zoe here!!! We made this account for all the Leo fans out there. We love u Leo!!!” Yes, it features no less than six exclamation points — as well as a variety of emojis. I regret to report that although we felt very passionately about this endeavor on that bus ride, we did not post very often. The page features no more than four carefully-curated images of a young DiCaprio, with captions like, “MY Leo!” and “Leo!!! #cute #amazing #love” with many heart emojis.
When I was thirteen, months after I stopped posting on @the_dicaprio_girls, I happened to meet Leonardo DiCaprio at a hotel in New York City (for somewhat embarrassing photographic evidence, scroll to the very bottom of my Instagram.) While I was absolutely starstruck and could not bring myself to utter a word in his presence, this was perhaps also the moment that I realized Leo is actually 26 years older than me, and not immortalized as the youthful Jack Dawson. This was the source of some cognitive dissonance for me. I also now recognize that Leo himself has no issue with twenty-plus year age differences with his girlfriends, who are perpetually younger than 25.
Eight years later, neither Zoe nor I are entirely sure what spurred our obsession with a nearly forty year old man. But, like most middle school phases, our infatuation with Leonardo DiCaprio slowly waned as the months went on. In 2021, we look back on this period with a mix of amusement and bewilderment. Still, we must never forget where we came from. To this day, I text Zoe a halfway-ironic “Happy Leo Day!” on Nov. 11, his birthday. And to this day, you can follow @the_dicaprio_girls on Instagram. In fact, I think you should — nay, you must. If this is my legacy, then I’m proud of it.
— Outgoing Film Exec and incoming Arts Chair Jaden S. Thompson is a reformed DiCaprio girl, who now likes the actor strictly for his impressive filmography. For thoughtful discourse on which DiCaprio/Scorsese collab is the best, or the merits of those Luhrmann/DiCaprio adaptations, DM @the_dicaprio_girls on Instagram.

[Disclaimer: This Arts Vanity was created under the Riot Games Legal Policies using assets owned by Riot Games. Riot Games does not endorse or sponsor this article.]
Soon after I met my friend Leo at our first orchestra rehearsal of freshman year, he told me I’d be really good at “League of Legends” — which, like playing the piano, largely involves pressing the right keys at the right time.
When I finally downloaded the game eight months later, on the same laptop screen that had just become my only classroom for the spring 2020 semester, I couldn’t have proven him more wrong.
“At its most basic level, League of Legends is a game of capture the flag,” reads a 2014 New York Times article, “though that is a bit like describing brain surgery as ‘a medical procedure.’” In the most popular game mode, two five-person teams face off on the battlefield of Summoner’s Rift. As with many of my important life choices, I trusted Leo’s unassailable guidance on which player character, or champion, to pick.
“You should be Morgana,” he said, “because you both wear purple all the time.”
Minutes into my first match, I found myself struggling to follow the only advice Leo had given me — “Don’t die.” Bullets and magic spells, seemingly flying at me from all directions at once, depleted my health bar as I launched purple fireballs at nothing in particular.
Still, I hadn’t had so much fun in months. The only other place where I’d ever experienced that level of sheer immediacy, a feeling I’d almost intentionally forgotten for fear of missing it too much, was onstage. Leo’s earlier comparison made perfect sense: “League” and music require players to be completely in the moment, and with rehearsals postponed indefinitely, only the former could make a dent in the monotony of quarantine.
On Summoner’s Rift, you can leave base 15 seconds after a game starts. Minions and jungle monsters first spawn at 1:05. 14 minutes in, the protective plates on your team’s turrets give way. I remember memorizing these times as if “League” were my sixth class and reciting them to Leo over voice chat, in defiance of our declining ability to tell the days apart.
With each match, I got better at fighting not only the opposing team but also the ever-present temptation to reduce my favorite pastimes to mere tests of reflexes and muscle memory. Fixating on the flawless execution of an especially tricky cadenza or combo move makes it all too easy to forget that pressing keys for hours on end is only worthwhile when it’s fun.
But all those hours had started to take their toll on my hands by March 2021, when Riot Games announced the 155th “League” champion: Gwen, a fabric doll come to life who fights evil with her creator’s sewing tools. I’d always loved crocheting to relieve piano-induced joint pain, and Riot had given me a great idea for my next project.
My crochet version of Gwen now sits on a shelf in my dorm room. Even though Leo and I haven’t had a lot of time to play “League” since moving back to campus this fall, I still wonder at how a game whose goal is destruction so powerfully asserts the joy of creating — and how, when we were hundreds of miles apart, it was the Rift that brought us closer than ever.
— Outgoing Music Executive and incoming Covers Editor-at-Large Clara V. Nguyen ’23 would usually rather be playing “League of Legends” than the piano. To share your thoughts on either, contact clara.nguyen@thecrimson.com.

Monday evenings are a special time in the week when The Crimson’s most creative, critical, and cultured writers convene to discuss and distribute Arts pieces for publication. More importantly, though, Arts meetings are a time for writers to display their impeccable taste in fashion and their unique approach to style.
Dressing yourself for an Arts meeting is an intricate art (pun intended). The writers that get it, get it, and the writers that don’t, don’t. Luckily for those writers that don’t get it, I’ve compiled a list of items that are sure to take your wardrobe to the next level for Arts meetings.
Tote Bag
Nothing screams “I’m a creative” more than carrying a slightly-worn canvas tote bag filled with a collection of items so random that if you showed anyone, you’d look borderline unhinged. All you really need in your bag to achieve this look is a loose pair of airpods outside of their case, a paperback novel you’ve only read 23 pages of, grossly-oversized sunglasses that are totally unnecessary for the 7 p.m. meeting time, and, of course, your laptop. It doesn’t particularly matter where your tote is from, although you’ll get extra cool points if it's a highly coveted New Yorker bag or one from an underground bookstore. The Crimson actually made some tote bags recently that would be perfect for Arts meetings and rather self-referential, if you’re so inclined.
Heeled Shoe (or better yet, Platforms)
Let’s face it. Arts writers are by and large vertically challenged. That is, you’ll be hard pressed to find a writer taller than six feet at a Monday Arts meeting (excluding Crimed Mikel J. Davies ’22-’23). Personally, I’m obsessed with being a short king, but I understand that not everyone agrees with this sentiment. A heeled shoe can — both figuratively and literally — elevate your outfit, subtly giving you that height you’re looking for to tower over your fellow writers. It’s not lost on me that heels can often be uncomfortable if they’re not made in a chunky style, so a comparable alternative would be platform shoes. Besides, what’s the point of dropping a bag on Naked Wolfe platforms if you can’t solicit envy at Arts meetings?
Your Favorite Thrift
One of the best feelings in the world is being complimented for a piece and getting to respond “Oh, I thrifted it” when you're asked where you got it from. Never mind running the risk of creating false exclusivity — some things are fun to gatekeep. My favorite thrift is a pair of Black Justin cowboy boots with flame-embossed detailing, and I love to wear them to Arts meetings when I feel like giving Western chic. Your favorite thrift might be a funky, chunky knit sweater or a crochet bucket hat made by someone’s grandma. Whatever it may be, the story behind it will make or break your outfit.
Band T-Shirt
Arts writers are arguably the most qualified individuals to wear a band t-shirt. Not only are they familiar with the band plastered on their torso, they probably listen to them avidly. Forget asking an Arts writer to name five songs released by the band; they could easily tell you the best album in the band’s discography along with a detailed explanation why. If this description applies to you, you’d better break out your favorite band t-shirt and use it as an excuse to show off your niche knowledge at the next Arts meeting.
Fingerless Gloves
Fingerless gloves ostensibly mock the notion of utility. What could be the use of gloves that don’t cover your fingers? Our writers that also happen to be musicians can easily answer this question. There’s no reason to sacrifice dexterity for warmth, and a musician might even argue that dexterity is most important. I’ve been fond of fingerless gloves ever since I saw Arthur’s (the anthropomorphic aardvark’s) piano instructor sporting them during my childhood. What’s more, they’d be particularly flattering for your digits when you're battling another writer for a mutually-desired piece via Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Blundstones
Don’t be shocked. You’re shocked? You’re shocked?! While Doc Marten boots are wildly popular among the Arts Board, I raise you Blundstones, Doc Martens’ hipster cousin. To be frank, I saw Editor-at-Large Amelia F. Roth-Dishy ’22-’23 wearing a pair of Blundstones and light wash denim, so I bought a pair of Blundstones and light wash denim and you should too.
Honorable Mention: A Canadian Tux to make Monday night your own Britney Spears red carpet moment.

Uwakwe covered New York Fashion Week in person one time and thinks he has the authority to create style guides for The Crimson Arts now.

Clairo. Billie Eilish. Soundgarden. Wolf Alice. King Princess. Gus Dapperton. Caroline Polachek. Pearl Jam. Dreamers. Faye Webster. The 1975. The list of concerts where I have made (read: fought or otherwise schemed) my way to the barricade goes on and on. What started with my very first concert way back in 2005, the Miami stop of the Wiggles’ Sailing Around the World Live! tour, is now standard practice.
I say I do this because I love the music I’m seeing and want to be as close to it as possible — because who wouldn’t want to be? It’s also partly because nothing feels better than the cool of the metal railing on your skin as you grip the barricade. Your knuckles turn white from trying to stay still as the crowd moves behind you, but you can somewhat relax knowing that as the sea of people ebbs and flows, you will stay moored front and center. But the main reason why I dedicate so much of my time waiting in long pre-show lines hours before doors open? The reason why I often spend the first hour or so inside the venue subtly maneuvering my way to the very front? So that I can actually see what’s going on.
I have been stuck behind a too-tall concertgoer far too many times to ignore the fact that, for someone coming in at five-foot-three inches like me, watching a general admission show from anywhere behind the first three rows is an endless battle for tiny windows of unobstructed viewing. Trying to watch an entire show through these “windows,” created as often as they are destroyed by the dozens of swaying shoulders in front of me, is a nightmare.
No, I would much rather enjoy the concert in all its glory. It’s a better experience when my ability to watch the performers is not determined by the whims of the tall people in front of me, but by my own willingness to tough it out and stake my claim to the luxury real estate up front. Indeed, most people would agree that being able to physically see the performers is the least I could want from any show I’ve spent months anticipating. And while I’ve since devised a host of tactics to make sure that I am able to reach the barricade and thus be able to see the concert in front of me every single time — tactics including but not limited to elbows, strategic foot placement, and befriending everyone in front of me — I think we as a concert-going public must do more to ensure concert-viewing equity.
The phrase “Girls to the front!” was popularized in the ‘90s by Kathleen Hanna, the inimitable frontwoman of the feminist punk band Bikini Kill. As leaders of the Riot Grrrl movement, Bikini Kill were committed to making underground music scenes in the Pacific Northwest and beyond safe and welcoming for women, non-men in general, and other marginalized identities. Their mission was to “make it easier for girls to see/hear each other’s work.” “Girls to the front,” then, became a rallying cry at their shows, where they would ask the guys taking up space in the front and center rows to make space for others to take their place. The goal was two-fold: To make concerts safer for women who wanted to enjoy the show and could now have their own safe space from which to do so, and to make concerts more enjoyable and accessible at large.
Having learned from the experience of being forced to stand uncomfortably close to certain people at shows big and small, I think the Riot Grrrl movement’s idea is an incredibly intriguing one. Who wouldn’t want to make concerts — with all their magic, energy, and good vibes — more welcoming? I simply propose a (small) addition. Concert venues and artists should think critically about different ways in which they can make sure all women and marginalized groups have a safe, inclusive space from which to watch their favorite performers and lose themselves to the music. But maybe, just maybe, they can consider carving out an extra space at the very front for the short girls, too?
— After a career spent making her way to the barricade at dozens of concerts, outgoing Culture Exec and incoming Arts Chair Sofia Andrade is looking for a better alternative. Anyone with the power to change how music venues work can contact her at sofia.andrade@thecrimson.com. If you have lonely concert tickets looking for a home, DM her on Twitter at @bySofiaAndrade.

Three and a half years have passed since I first stepped into the Sanctum — that hallowed room on the second floor of 14p where Arts gathers on Mondays at 7 p.m. to drink, be merry, and discuss cultural ephemera while Biz makes their important little business calls and News tinkers with their daily little newspaper down below.
Since then, I have given much of my energy and sanity to this board: as a staff writer, as a Blog Exec, as an Editor-at-Large, as a part-time social chair, and once, famously, as “that girl Amelia” to Harvard Crimson President emeritus Amanda Y. Su. (Sorry for double-booking the roof!)
I should be satisfied — proud, even. I should pass peacefully into dino-dom with Joy, Kalos, Hunter, Connor, and Lanz, goals accomplished, thousands (?) of articles published, friends and frenemies made along the way.
Yet I lie awake at night, tossing and turning. I know in my heart that I won’t be remembered for any of this.
Rather, one thing has become devastatingly clear as our tenure comes to an end. I fear that my legacy in the eyes of the 151s, the 150s, and even, woefully, the beloved incoming execs of the 149th Guard has become inextricable from one horrible, wonderful television series about a high school show choir in Ohio.
Reader, you read that right. It is “Glee” that will taint me forever.
Let me explain. Early in the pandemic, I discovered that “Glee,” a show I hadn’t watched since it originally aired while I was in middle school, was now on Netflix. I undertook a rewatch and became obsessed, as is admittedly my wont.
Guided by a patented strategy of skipping every scene featuring only adults/teachers who were not Sue Sylvester — which significantly and mercifully cut down my exposure to one Will Schuester — I raced through the show once, then twice. I watched “Glee: The 3D Concert Movie” more times than I’d like to share. (But consider this a plug: It’s all the fun singing and dancing without the plot!) As the world slowly opened up in late summer, I made my dear friends watch as much “Glee” as they could stand without kicking me out of their homes or pretending that they had been exposed to Covid and we couldn’t hang out anymore.
The unexpected emotional resonance of my rewatch came not just from the show itself but from my slowly unfurling realization that its uneven and yet groundbreaking queer representation had impacted me when I first watched it in ways I could only now parse. I felt deja vu seeing scenes of Santana Lopez and Brittany S. Pierce nuzzle necks in private and, eventually, slow-dance in public — scenes that, in retrospect, were seared into my brain before I knew why I might care about them.
When the late, great Naya Rivera, who portrayed Santana Lopez, died tragically in July of 2020, I was almost inexplicably heartbroken. This only deepened my sudden and unpredicted emotional attachment to the show, and to her star-making performance on it.
That’s all well and good, you may be thinking. But isn’t “Glee” bad? To which I answer: Yes! In a real sense, “Glee” is bad, especially after the first three seasons (some would say two, some would say one, but if you are familiar with the Troubletones, you know why I extend my endorsement as far as I do.) The plot routinely contradicts itself and makes no sense. The racial politics are atrocious, the explorations of gender identity deeply flawed — indeed, the entire show is a blundering investigation of what it would look like to make six seasons worth of Very Special Episodes. Characters utter sentences that are so 2010 it hurts. And while some of the musical numbers are rightful cultural touchstones — unparalleled exemplars of musical-theater excellence on the small screen — others are, well, “What Does the Fox Say?”
I cannot defend “Glee.” The arguments against it are unfalsifiable. All I can say is that it hooked my nostalgic, college-aged, pandemic-era heart and did not let go for a weirdly long time — and that there are moments in which it is genuinely sublime television.
Most of those moments take the form of musical numbers. This leads me back to the question of legacy: specifically my legacy, on the Harvard Crimson Arts Board. In December of 2020, roughly eight months into my renewed fandom, I had the brilliant idea to rank every single musical performance ever done on “Glee,” all 700+ of them. I floated it among my fellow execs. They wished me godspeed, and some semi-activated fellow “Glee” fans even offered to help, then-outgoing Arts Chair Allison J. Scharmann and then-incoming Arts Chair Joy C. Ashford chief among them. But the list never materialized, largely because of the core idea being unhinged.
Flash forward to the Fall of 2021: In-person Arts meetings are back! My dear friend/co-conspirator/tacit enabler Connor S. Dowd and I return triumphantly to the Sanctum as Editors-at-Large. Technically without a pitching purview since our Blog days, we nonetheless obnoxiously insert ourselves into the flow of Arts meetings by creating an “EALs Corner” where we pitch out random stuff and project stock images of eels in corners. It is both great fun and a thinly disguised effort to ensure that the compers know who we are.
By now, my “Glee” obsession has faded somewhat. (Perhaps time, plus the impending removal of a show from Netflix, does heal all things.) Still, it occurs to me that my inspired project of ranking all 700+ musical numbers from “Glee” is important journalism and needs to happen, even if I myself have yet to gather the time and wherewithal to do so.
Each week, I pitch out the ranking in EALs Corner — humorously at first, then with a growing tinge of desperation as the semester ticks by. It’s been weeks, nay, months since I watched a full episode of the show. Still, “Glee” hangs like a melodramatic, Murphyean specter over my life, my Arts persona. At a certain point, the spin becomes: Please pick this up and save Amelia from herself!
Nevertheless, I persevere. Connor eggs me on: “Pitch it again,” he says, with a devilish grin. “Maybe this week someone will change their mind!” Exhausted, I believe him.
The ranking becomes a running joke, me the laughingstock. The compers giggle, clearly uncomfortable, as I beg them for the eleventh time to watch, rank, and describe every musical number from a show that first aired in 2009 and once made Jane Lynch dress up like Nicki Minaj and rap “Super Bass.”
People say things to me like, “if you start it, I’ll help!” or, “why don’t we just rank the top 100 or even the top 50 like every other publication?” or “are you okay, though?”
I stand firm — too firm. My years of positive contributions to the Arts Board fade away into the cold Monday evening air. I bring PBRs to production night, but it’s too late. Like the Giving Tree, I have nothing left to offer. I have become, improbably, the “Glee” girl.
And so it goes. The pitch remains unclaimed; my fate is sealed, though there are worse ones. The only way out is through. We are now dinos, the “Glee” musical number ranking is my legacy, and there’s not much for me to do but just write the damn thing. Who’s in?
— Outgoing Editor-at-Large Amelia Roth-Dishy '22-'23 could have written the infamous “Glee” musical number ranking in all the time she spent procrastinating the writing of this vanity. She loves this board, is profoundly excited for its future, and hopes as usual that she has misread everyone’s perception of her but is resigned to the reality of the situation either way. You can reach her at amelia.roth-dishy@thecrimson.com; she tweets sometimes @scallionshmear.

BOSTON — Federal officials testified in court Monday that allegedly false statements made by Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber led government agencies to conclude investigations into the chemist and continue funding his research before they could fully explore his ties to China.
Lieber, who was arrested on Harvard’s campus in January 2020, is on trial for allegedly lying to federal investigators about his connections to the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese government recruitment initiative.
The former Harvard Chemistry chair is also charged with four tax offenses for failing to report income from China and foreign bank accounts to the Internal Revenue Service.
During the fifth day of the trial on Monday, jurors heard from federal officials who investigated Lieber’s TTP affiliations for the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health, both of which provided millions of dollars for his research.
DOD investigator Amy R. Mousseau testified that Lieber said in 2018 he “wasn’t sure how China categorized him” in relation to the TTP. Six years prior to the interview, however, Lieber allegedly signed a contract with the program, which prosecutors presented in court Friday.
Mousseau testified that the Pentagon became concerned about Lieber’s possible China affiliations after receiving “open-source information” that connected him to the TTP in early 2018. She said the DOD believed Lieber may have committed grant fraud in relation to the roughly $3 million he received from the agency. In April of that year, she traveled to Cambridge to interview Lieber on Harvard’s campus.
Following the interview, Mousseau said she closed the DOD investigation because she thought he had been truthful.
“I believed he was a victim of Chinese propaganda,” Mousseau said.
However, during a 2020 FBI interrogation, Lieber told federal agents that he “wasn’t completely transparent” during the interview with Mousseau.
Pressed by Lieber’s lead defense attorney, Marc L. Mukasey, Mousseau said the notes from the interview did not indicate that Lieber had explicitly denied membership in the TTP. She also testified that she does not recall the exact questions she asked Lieber about his China ties.
During his opening statement last Tuesday, Mukasey said the officials who interviewed Lieber “didn’t even write down the statements that Charlie is on trial for.”
Experts and professors who support Lieber have alleged that the Department of Justice’s China Initiative — which Lieber’s investigation fell under — racially targets researchers of Chinese heritage. Pressed by Mukasey, Mousseau said an official from the Naval Research Laboratory raised concerns about the number of Chinese students working in Lieber’s lab, which played a role in the decision to investigate Lieber.
In 2019, the NIH also began investigating Lieber over a potential financial conflict of interest, but the agency ultimately decided not to take action against the scientist. NIH administrator Michael Lauer testified Monday that the agency would have investigated Lieber further if it had been made aware of his involvement with the TTP.
Lauer asked Harvard in November 2018 to conduct an “internal compliance review” of Lieber’s research after receiving information connecting him to the TTP. Lauer said the NIH was “satisfied” with Harvard’s response, which stated that Lieber “represented that he is not and has never been” a TTP member.
Prosecutors say Harvard’s response to the NIH constitutes a false statement from Lieber. Defense attorneys alleged in court last Tuesday that the University “doctored and meddled with” Lieber’s initial statement before sending its response to the NIH.
Lauer said the NIH would have had “lots of questions” if Lieber had informed investigators of his alleged TTP affiliation, adding that researchers who fail to disclose foreign funding may face consequences, including grant termination.
Mousseau, the DOD investigator, also testified that she would have expanded the DOD’s inquiry into Lieber if he had told the agency about an affiliation with the TTP.
Carl L. Goodman, the accountant who filed Lieber’s taxes, testified Monday that the chemist did not inform him of income from the Wuhan University of Technology in 2013 or 2014, when prosecutors say Lieber falsely reported his taxes. Goodman added he only spoke with Lieber’s wife, Jennifer Lieber, when preparing the family’s joint taxes.
Prosecutors allege that Lieber failed to report income he received from WUT on his tax returns in 2013 and 2014. Colleen Ranahan, an IRS revenue agent, testified Monday that Lieber would have owed the government an estimated $7,600 more in 2013 and $15,200 more in 2014 if he had disclosed the alleged income.
As prosecutors questioned Ranahan, fire alarms went off in the courthouse, cutting the day of trial short by several minutes.
