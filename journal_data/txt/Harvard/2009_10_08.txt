After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 5, District of Columbia City Councilman David Catania introduced legislation legalizing same-sex marriage. The measure enjoys overwhelming support among City Council members, two of whom are gay, as well as the support of Mayor Adrian Fenty, virtually guaranteeing its passage. However, due to an archaic and unjust constitutional clause granting congressional veto power over all of DC’s local legislation, the bill’s fate is far from determined.
If Congress, home to a still-powerful caucus of gay -marriage opponents, were to issue a joint resolution of disapproval, and if President Obama, who too opposes same-sex marriage, were to sign it, DC’s measure, no matter how resoundingly approved by the City Council, would be overturned. This underscores the lamentable nature of DC’s current situation in which it finds itself presided over by a body of officials for whom no DC residents voted.
We are heartened by the DC City Council’s promotion of equal rights for all its constituents, and we urge Congress not to meddle in local affairs despite its unrepresentative constitutional mandate to do so.
The controversy over DC’s gay marriage laws comes in the midst of similar fights in Maine, where the issue is on the ballot this November; Iowa, where same-sex marriage was legalized earlier this year; and California, whose infamous Proposition 8 roused passions across the nation. It is understandable, therefore, that many congressmen will see the issue of same-sex marriage in DC as yet another opportunity to use a traditional wedge issue to wage political warfare, be it to advance the prospects of progressive candidates in left-leaning districts, drive a wedge between socially conservative minorities and the sociallyliberal Democratic Party, or rile up the base of the Republican Party in advance of 2010’s midterm elections.
In this all-too-plausible scenario, DC would see its authority usurped—albeit legitimately. For this reason, the Constitution should be amended to rectify the problem of DC’s lack of representation, whether by granting the nation’s capitol statehood or by abolishing the current rules granting Congress the authority to veto DC’s laws. In the meantime, however, Congress should stay on the sidelines and let the progress of equal rights continue unimpeded in Washington.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most people have heard, in some form or another, the famous “Stars and Stripes Forever” march by John Philip Sousa, with its crisp trumpet lines, sonorous bass undertones, and delicate flute ornamentation. The piece is rightly a classic of 20th-century wind band literature. Yet despite its popularity, mere mention of the word “wind ensemble” often elicits either blank indifference or vague recollection of a long-dropped middle- school activity. This is unfortunate—for though it tends to be overlooked, the wind ensemble offers an artistic experience as beautiful as anything performed in Sanders Theatre.
The wind ensemble has a long and rich history. Evolving from 19th century military bands, typically known for their performances of sharp, fast-paced marches, the first modern wind ensembles took form in the 1950s. These groups possessed a musical repertoire that, while originating as a uniquely American style, quickly spread worldwide. Indeed, in their heyday, wind bands proved to be a powerful attraction, drawing wide audiences.
Harvard’s own wind ensemble, though popular, was no stranger to innovation. It was hosted by the late composer Henry Brant, a pioneer in ideas of spatialization in music; for Brant, the rhythms and melodies of music were not enough to capture the “new stresses, layered insanities, and multi-directional assaults of contemporary life on the spirit.” In addition to traditional orchestration, he arranged the members of the ensemble in such a way as to provide a richer experience for the listener. Indeed, Lowell Lecture Hall was reportedly one of Brant’s favorite places to hold a concert—true to his spirit, when my ensemble performed his work, we placed a row of trumpets in the balcony flanked by flutes. To those on the floor below, the sounds washing down from above blended with those from either side to provide a warm, blanket-like musical experience.
As musical tastes have evolved, however, the institution of concert bands has regrettably come to occupy a narrower and narrower niche. Dwindling audiences at performances—even at Harvard, which has boasted such greats as Leroy Anderson and Leonard Bernstein—are the surest indicator of such a transition. Those seeking high culture these days often gravitate to grand symphony orchestras specializing in post 18th century European music or else perform adaptations of popular music.
As well known as the works of Mozart, Tchaikovsky, or Beethoven are (and nobody can possibly underestimate the contributions of these musical giants), a body of equally powerful music exists in the repertoire of the wind ensemble. Percy Grainger’s epic “Lincolnshire Posy” emerged from his personal travels in the English countryside, where he collected folk songs and transformed them into a rich, layered multi-movement piece. Each movement adopts the personality and unique melody of a folk singer but is adapted for a modern ensemble.
Wind ensembles occupy a special position in the musical tradition, blending the refinement of high music with the spirit of the modern day. Students ought to realize that Harvard is uniquely placed to offer a rich musical experience that is often underappreciated by those looking for good music. Even if Bach or Britney is more to your taste, it is worthwhile to explore an area of music that is much more far-ranging than “three cheers for the red, white, and blue.”

Suppose you won the lottery. What would you do with the money? Countries have faced similar questions. The most common example is a price commodity boom. A country exports a great deal of petroleum or copper or similar commodities. The price of this commodity zooms; the country’s revenues do as well. From Caracas to Lagos to Moscow and Tehran, governments whose countries have benefited from commodity price booms have rarely spent such a bonanza well. Chile witnessed a commodity price boom during this past decade, and it has set an admirable example for others.
International copper prices rose markedly earlier in this decade. Instead of spending the funds on projects of near-term political value, Chile’s President Michelle Bachelet and Finance Minister Andrés Velasco (the latter on leave from the Kennedy School) took the lead to create an investment fund that would not be tapped for ongoing operational expenses. The fund could be used to help the Chilean economy avoid an economic collapse; when the worldwide financial crisis broke out 18 months ago, the Chilean government was ready with a countercyclical budget—it spent to cushion the downturn and reactivate the economy.
A second important decision of the Bachelet government was to invest billions from this fund in the development of the skills and capacities of its people. On September 3, 2008, the Bachelet administration established procedures for its Bicentennial System to Train Advanced Human Capital Abroad (“bicentennial” because it marks Chile’s declaration of independence in 1810). This program, known as “Becas Chile,” is on scholarships.
On September 16, 2009, Harvard University and the Republic of Chile signed an agreement to facilitate the enrollment of master’s and doctoral students in Harvard Schools of Public Health, Education, Design, Government, Medicine, and Arts and Sciences. Master’s scholarships would be for up to two years and PhD and other doctorate fellowships for up to four years, to be supplemented through teaching fellow appointments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. There would also be funds for postdoctoral fellows as well as special students. Students are allowed to take longer to complete their doctorate, though with funds from other sources.
Chilean students will apply directly to the pertinent Harvard program and be accepted according to normal Harvard admissions procedures. The Chilean Ministry of Education through Becas Chile would then award scholarships to the Chileans whom Harvard would have admitted. The Chilean national science foundation, “CONICYT,” will implement the merit-based Chilean selection process. There is no Chilean government cap on the number of students that it could fund at Harvard; the number will depend on how many Chileans Harvard admits. The Chilean government will award fellowships based on financial- need guidelines that follow those of Harvard’s Committee on General Scholarships.
The Chilean government has designed a particularly thoughtful program. The fellowships cover round-trip airfares, tuition, a monthly living allowance, insurance, and an additional yearly allowance for books and pertinent materials. The fellowship provides a monthly allowance for a spouse and for each child as well as for the costs of first moving to the Boston area. Most importantly, the Chilean government will also provide English-language training in Chile to prepare students for their study abroad. Bright, hard-working Chilean students from poorer families may lack sufficient competence in English; language instruction is designed to increase the likelihood of more socially egalitarian access to these scholarships and thus to a Harvard degree.
The agreement commits both parties to “do their best efforts” to send and receive at least 50 participants per year. In academic year 2008-2009, there were 27 Chilean passport holders enrolled at Harvard who required a visa to enter the U.S. Absent this new fellowship program, Harvard expected 25-30 Chileans to be enrolled. In effect, the agreement calls for doubling the number of Chileans at Harvard. Of the 27 Chileans at Harvard as of last full count, 14 were in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which is also the likeliest future beneficiary of the new agreement. If Chile and Harvard succeed in also enrolling students in schools such as Education, Design, and Public Health, as the agreement proposes, that would be especially welcome because, in 2008-2009, there were no Chileans in degree programs at Harvard in Education or Public Health and only one in the Design School.
At the recent signing ceremony, Chilean Finance Minister Andrés Velasco noted his view about good long-term macroeconomic forecasting: Look around a Harvard PhD classroom. Countries with students in such classes are a good indicator of good performance 10 to 20 years ahead. In the Harvard of 20 years ago, that would have led to forecasting that China and South Korea would perform well. The forecast for Chile already looks good, and it should be better. Neither Chile nor Harvard won the lottery, but, together, we are doing something better—not relying on chance but investing in some of the brightest and hardest-working young people to learn and generate knowledge and, in so doing, to help create a better world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine being a child again, playing with your friends at the playground.  Suddenly, another child, bigger and stronger than the rest, joins in. He insists on cheating and playing by rules that just apply to him. Predictably, he starts winning. You know this is unfair, but if you say something, he might beat you up. He looks pretty tough, after all. Better just to keep quiet and hope that the bully starts playing fairly.
In today’s global economy, China has become this neighborhood bully, defying established trade rules with impunity. This imposes a significant cost on the United States and presents a dangerous challenge to the free market.
Since the 1970s, most currencies have been free to fluctuate, or “float,” in response to changing economic conditions. China’s currency, the yuan, was once pegged to the dollar. Although technically it has floated since 2005, China only allows the yuan to fluctuate in a narrow, artificially low range. The People’s Bank of China maintains this position by buying about $200 billion worth of U.S. dollars per year from currency markets in order to purchase American treasury bonds. This increases the value of the dollar relative to the yuan.
Just how undervalued is the yuan? The exact answer remains something of a mystery, as most estimates typically range from 10 to 40 percent. A highly acclaimed Peterson Institute for International Economics study recently estimated that the yuan is 15 to 25 percent too low. Regardless of the exact situation, today’s exchange rate clearly does not reflect the yuan’s true value.
To date, China has built up nearly $2 trillion in U.S. currency and treasury bonds. Although this market intervention imposes a cost on the PBOC, China’s government deems it worthwhile because an undervalued yuan makes Chinese exports more competitive in the world market. This stimulates China’s export-oriented manufacturing base, creating jobs.
But this arrangement adversely impacts China’s trade partners. Currency manipulation artificially subsidizes Chinese exports, placing American manufacturers at a major disadvantage and violating World Trade Organization conventions. Furthermore, China’s endless purchase of treasury bonds depresses long-term interest rates in the United States. This diminishes domestic savings, encourages ill-advised lending, and makes it tantalizingly cheap to finance giant budget deficits. You may recognize these very factors as contributors to the current recession; they must be reversed for robust growth to occur.
This argument is not an attempt to irrationally bash China. The country’s rapid growth has lifted millions from poverty and created wealth in developed countries. But its currency manipulation has caused a damaging structural imbalance. Therefore, American government intervention is justifiable to restore the true free-market equilibrium.
U.S. law already requires the treasury to report currency manipulators to Congress, but the treasury has failed at this duty—it has not cited a single instance of currency manipulation since 1994. This is unsurprising: The treasury is inclined to turn a blind eye to China’s actions, since low interest rates, which sustain fiscal stimulus and encourage consumer spending, are crucial for economic recovery. Frankly, it would be unwise to confront China in the midst of a major recession. But once strong economic growth resumes, Congress should instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to appeal to the WTO for arbitration. The WTO has the power to declare China’s undervaluation of the yuan an illegal subsidy. If it takes no action or China ignores its ruling, then Congress should impose trade sanctions on Chinese imports.
Although administration officials are reluctant to challenge the Chinese dragon for fear of being scorched, China is unlikely to retaliate harshly. Policymakers fear three potential scenarios. The first: China would impose new tariffs on American goods. While this would affect American producers, it would also harm Chinese citizens. China is the world’s fourth largest consumer of American goods, which would become pricier in this scenario. Another possibility: China would slowly diversify out of American assets. True, this would increase U.S. interest rates. However, waiting until after the recession to confront China lessens America’s need for these low rates. The most frightening threat: China would rapidly dump treasury bonds in an attempt to submerge the dollar’s value. But China’s dollar holdings are so vast that selling them all without incurring a huge loss would be impossible. Also, destabilizing the American economy would be deadly for China’s own export-led economy. In all three cases, China is unlikely to cut off its nose to spite its face.
John F. Kennedy ’40 said that the Chinese word for crisis is composed of two characters: one meaning danger, the other meaning opportunity. While this is not entirely factual, the metaphor sticks in this case. Despite China’s willingness to game the currency market, long-term global prosperity still rests on our ability to fully integrate China into the world economy. Ultimately, we can further this goal only when we summon the courage to stand up to the neighborhood bully.

After last night, my whole entryway knows my favorite color of panties!My resident dean is still calling me “Ralph” two years after that formal!’80s one-hit-wonder Rockwell once sang, “I always feel like somebody’s watching me.” Of course, everyone thinks that’s Michael Jackson’s song—no one’s watching Rockwell. But for those of us with some actual notoriety, the constant vigilance of the public can certainly be a problem. How can we have fun when our nightly shenanigans invariably turn into breakfast table gossip? Should you get up on that table? Should you make out with that girl who’s suddenly cute after 1 a.m.? For the first time ever, the answer to your questions is math.Remember when Alcohol EDU taught us, “Something drinking blah blah decision making”? They may have been on to something. We need a standardized metric to tell us if we’re making bad decisions when we’re not sober enough to think for ourselves. Ergo, I present to you the Anonymity-Sketchiness Ratio, easily remembered as the ASR. In order for your action to not be sketchy, its anonymity must be as high as possible relative to its sketchiness. For those of you still in Math Xa, anonymity goes in the numerator and sketchiness goes in the denominator. Higher numbers are good: it means your witnesses don’t know or care who you are. Lower numbers are bad: it’s like posting to your news feed—everyone will know.Assume “sketchiness” to equal awkward, bizarre, generally stupid, embarrassing, and all manner of party foul behavior. Let’s look at some examples.Taking off your shirt on the dance floor is pretty dumb (haven’t you seen As It Were?), but not exactly sketchy, so it’s pretty safe even if everyone knows you, like at your best friend’s birthday party. Going bottom-naked, however, is ill-advised unless you are at a concert out-of-state. The sketchy denominator of the Non-Sketchy ratio is just too high.Even a dance floor make out, DFMO for repeat offenders, can be a bad move depending on the attractiveness of your partner (victim?). But who hasn’t taken advantage of the aura of anonymity when visiting another school? Table dancing can be fine as long as it’s dark in the room; body shots are probably not unless it’s a masquerade.An important factor in this ratio is drunkenness, but let’s be real—it can work in one of two ways. You can be responsible and multiply sketchiness by how many drinks you’ve had, giving you a much lower Non-Sketchy ratio. Do this if you’ve woken up someplace where you don’t remember falling asleep more than once in the past month. Even if you won’t remember, tomorrow, someone else will. On the other hand, you can err on the side of fun and multiply anonymity by how many drinks you’ve had. Do this if you’re 20 years old and still a wallflower.Remember, this ratio is just a rule of thumb designed to keep you grounded when you can’t trust your first instinct about appropriate behavior. There are certain notable conditions under which calculating the Non-Sketchy ratio will not sufficiently lead to the best course of action. If you have one of those final club-hopping TFs, his presence at a party would make even a slurred sentence way too sketchy. Leave immediately. If you spot your crush across the room right as you begin to hop up on the keg to perform the gargoyle, do a leapfrog instead and stick to solo cups. At the other end of the spectrum, family weddings have an opposite effect. Take advantage of the opportunity to teach your grandmother how to jerk, even though these people undoubtedly know you very well.Now that you’re armed with knowledge of the Non-Sketch ratio, you can say goodbye to feeling too embarrassed to go to the dining hall the next morning. You can confidently drink away your good sense and judgment, as long as you can remember to take a quick count of how many people in the room recognize you. And if that fails, then just try to convince someone else to be stupid with you. One sketchy person will look foolish, but two sketchy people can look like they’re having a great time. But that’s next lesson.

As if Harvard didn’t already have enough rockstar professors, we just managed to snag F. Orhan Pamuk, the famed Turkish novelist and Nobel Laureate, as Harvard’s Charles Eliot Norton Lecturer of the semester. The English Department’s new kid on the block will be giving guest talks on the art of the novel, which will be open to all at Sanders Theater. The Columbia professor, who splits his time between New York and Istanbul, sits down with FM to chat about Harvard, freedom of speech, and why winning isn’t everything.
1. Fifteen Minutes:  You are currently delivering a series of talks titled, “The Naïve and Sentimental Novelist.” What is the main focus of your lectures?
Orhan Pamuk: My lectures are focused on the art of the novel. They are from the point of view of the practitioner, not of the scholar or the historian.
2. FM: What do you hope to achieve during your time as Harvard’s Charles Eliot Norton Lecture this fall?
OP: First, as a professor, it is a joy to be here meeting students in various classes and looking at the interested audiences as they listen during my lectures. Next, as a writer, this is the best opportunity that I have to focus on my craft and write a book about the craft as I see it and as I practice it. Third, as a human being, what I want to achieve is to enjoy Harvard and be happy here.
3. FM: You’ve lectured at schools like Columbia University and Bard College. How do you think Harvard compares to other places that you’ve taught?
OP: At Harvard, there is more university self-consciousness. Everyone is proud to be at Harvard, especially young students, new faculty and new fellows. Me too, of course. I am new here as well!
4.FM: “My Name is Red” is possibly your most acclaimed novel. What do you think makes this book special?
OP: This book is about a painter’s dilemmas in Islam, and I actually painted until the age of 23. I knew how it felt to be a painter, when your hand does one thing, while your mind and your eye watch with amazement, as if someone else is drawing. I wanted to pass this experience to the reader.
5.FM: Which one of your characters are you most like and why?
OP: [Laughs] I distribute my feelings and my perceptions of the world through all of my characters. I don’t want any of them to look too similar or different from me. In “My Name is Red”, I appear as a small boy. I am also close to the protagonists in “Snow” and “The Black Book”.
6. FM: Which of your books are you most proud of?
OP: I can’t say I’m most proud of any of them, because the relationship is more complicated than that.  I am very deeply involved with my books, I wrote them. They’re like a part of my body.
7.  FM: These books have won you countless awards, including the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature. What’s the best part about winning the Nobel?
OP: It’s a lot of joy and makes life easier. Doors open by themselves. You have more strength to address readers. It brings you a lot of prestige, which makes life easy.
8.  FM: Speaking of having a large readership, do you receive any crazy fan mail?
OP: I receive lots of mail from readers—I wouldn’t call it fan mail—and I can’t answer all of it. What about when someone in Argentina, who had written poetry all his life but nobody understood him, puts all his poems in a box and sends it to you? [Laughs] What do I do with that now?
9. FM: Not only are you an accomplished novelist, you’re also a bit of a rebel. In 2005, after calling attention to the Turkish massacres of Armenians and Kurds, you were prosecuted by the Turkish state for violating Article 301, which condemns anyone who “explicitly insults the Republic.” How did it feel to be arraigned by your home country?
OP: You have to see the whole thing as a general picture. There are so many Turkish writers who have suffered so much, and still continue to be afflicted by the same issues of free speech. Because I was internationally famous, my problem was visible, but what I suffered was nothing.
10. FM: You are the first Nobel Prize winner from Turkey! Has the government offered to name a holiday after you yet?
OP: Nothing! But I’m not interested in whether they do anything or not. My standards are lower. I’ll be happy if they don’t put me in jail.
11. FM: In an interview with BBC, you’ve said that in books, characters are “instruments for you to see the city,” and the “inner depths of the characters are also deduced from the city.” How have you and Istanbul impacted each other?
OP: If you live in one place all your life, then that city makes you. I’m a writer of Istanbul, because it is where I have lived for almost all my life. I look out my window, and I see humanity in Istanbul. I write about humane characters, and I also write about Istanbul. It made me.
12. FM: You are also a Professor of Comparative Literature and Writing at Columbia. How do you feel about the translated versions of your books?
OP: I focus on the English translations. I read them very carefully and discuss them with the translators, who are my friends. This takes a lot of time, and I always say, “Wow, I gave all my time!” I hope there won’t be any problems with the next book. [Pause] There are always problems.
13.FM: You’re here in Cambridge for another few months. What do you miss most about Istanbul and New York?
OP: [Laughs] I’m happy just being here! Why should I be worrying about nostalgia? I’m enjoying Cambridge. I’ll be going back to New York and Istanbul, anyway. I’m more concerned with the wonder and fun in Cambridge rather than what I left behind.
14. FM: What advice do you have for aspiring writers?
OP: That they should not pay attention to any writer’s advice, including this one. [Laughs] They should pay attention to their professors, though.
15. FM: You have already been awarded the Nobel Prize. What’s next?
OP: [Laughs] I don’t know! I don’t write for the prizes. I’m happy about the Nobel Prize, but that’s not the only agenda in one’s life. I’m writing books. I plan many books and I’m working very hard. Heaven for me is achieving and finishing these novels, executing them with all the details I imagined.

When History Professor Niall C. D. Ferguson begins his lecture at 10:07 a.m., he abandons the podium, choosing instead to pace in a slow, deliberate loop around the lectern. He speaks with the kind of proper British accent that makes Anglophiles swoon. As he makes an argument about the French Revolution, his throat wraps around certain words with a silky aggression that he punctuates by cocking an eyebrow or gesturing with his left hand, index finger and thumb closed into an “o” around a stub of chalk. His words are actually improvised. His paper schedule book, full of cross-country speaking engagements, is not.
“I’m actually a very boring person,” Ferguson claims later.
But it’s a message that is falling on deaf ears. As Ferguson recalls, while aboard a ferry with his family on holiday, he was cornered by the ill-placed attentions of an enthusiastic male fan. That groupie was part his disproportionately gay male fanbase in the UK who became enamored with him after seeing him on TV.
Some professors entertain cold chairs during office hours and make do without starstruck students gossiping about them in Annenberg. Some, like Ferguson, contend with a different beast of visibility. And though the three discussed here—Niall Ferguson, N. Gregory Mankiw, and Robert A. Lue—are all accomplished, impressive individuals, each of them has a different method of managing his fame.
They are the celebrity professor, the rock star professor, the professor whose book you’ve read before your family lugs your worldly possessions through Johnston Gate. They may lecture in the same auditoriums as other academics, but they inspire a far different scope of admiration. This is what it’s like.
The in-demand economist
Mankiw is tall. He has a long, thin torso that exaggerates his height and shoulders that seem perpetually raised near his ears. He looks exactly like the headshot on his wildly popular economics blog, down to the the half-smile, mysterious as that of the Mona Lisa, which never leaves his face. He sits with arms crossed, wearing a button-down denim shirt and one leg crossed, utterly relaxed except for an occasional foot wiggle. For someone with a cult of personality and a class size that sometimes reaches into four digits, he is eminently unthreatening. His aura is kind. The decor of his office, in contrast, is sparse and blocky, with the only color coming from the endless, neatly arranged books on economics lining the walls. He name drops a lot in a casual, amused manner, as if he’s surprised that everyone from the Obama administration, the Harvard Medical School dean, and the Chief Financial Officer of Facebook all read his blog.
“I’m not so self-aware as to how other people perceive me,” he says at the very beginning when asked about his fame. Indeed, there seems to be a disconnect between the “real” Mankiw and the Mankiw that is the stuff of freshman gossip. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think he was clueless about his fame.
Students will set you straight.
“He’s the one freshman institution that exists,” Chris W. Danello ’12 says. “If you’re meeting someone new, you can talk about what they did that summer, you can talk about where they’re from, or you can talk about Greg Mankiw.”
His fame beyond his overcrowded freshman class lies in his lofty former positions as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors to the Bush White House from 2003-2005 along with textbooks that have sold over one million copies and become the classroom standard. Though his duties in research and teaching keep him busy, Mankiw is uniquely known for maintaining an active online presence in the form of a
daily-updated blog and a (former) Facebook profile. His New York Times editor has pushed him to get a Twitter, but he doesn’t seem too keen on the idea and describes himself as not being up to speed on technology.
Halfway to the 5,000 Facebook friend limit he last April, he posted on his blog under the title of “I am a friendly guy”: “I now have over 2500 friends on Facebook. Call me a pushover: I am ready to befriend anyone. (Try me again if, inadvertently, I have ever ignored your request in the past).”
“The problem is, I have no idea what it all means,” he wrote.
When he retired his Facebook profile after hitting the friend limit, blogs and news services picked up on the story of the overly-popular professor. The CFO of Facebook contacted him about making a fan page rather than a profile. “I haven’t gotten around to it,” he admits.
His blog, however, has no limit of readers, who check for daily updates at the tune of 20,000 page views per day. While it’s ostensibly to keep in touch with his Ec10 students, it’s attracted a global readership. But he does have two Facebook fan groups started by non-Harvard students. One, the Greg Mankiw Fan Club, has over 1,000 members who span the globe.
One such member is Zaur Seyidov, a 19-year-old at Azerbaijan Educational Economic University, who recounts his debt towards the professor.
“When I entered university, I had no economic knowledge,” he says by phone at 6:30 a.m. from his native Azerbaijan. “In our nation, books are difficult to understand, [there are] no economic pictures or graphs. When I read a chapter [on the law of supply and demand] in our nation’s book, I am afraid of this and I cannot pass exam. Then I read this chapter in Mankiw. Very easy to understand and this book encouraged me to continue.”
Bryce W. Stucki started the “Greg puts the ‘man’ in Mankiw” Facebook group which sports over 100 members. Mankiw himself was a member, at least until he deleted his profile.
“His blog is much more accessible than most economists who write. A lot of bloggers tend to be pretty extreme, at least the one’s I’ve read. [But Mankiw] likes to balance both sides of the issue a lot,” said Stucki, who decided to major in Economics partly due to Mankiw’s influence.
But it’s not all intellectual firepower that gets the fans to keep clicking. The founder of the “Greg Mankiw Fan Club” describes the professor’s appeal as personal as well as academic. “If you read [the blog] a lot, you get an idea of his personality. I do consider him a mentor. I think he’s a really nice guy, a really good guy, some one to look up to.”
Mankiw has proven so lovable that at one point, an “I love Greg Mankiw” t-shirt was sold on Amazon.com that has since been taken down. But even with apparel, office hours aren’t as crowded as his course—about five to ten students generally show up.
A regular office hour attendee was Neeral A. Gandhi ’12, who says the professor inquired about post-college plans and Christmas vacations along with dispensing insights on the financial crisis. “He wasn’t just locked up in the ivory tower,” she says. “He had real world experience.”
But the best anecdote about Mankiw’s many readers involves a certain telephone call. A student called his home number to ask a question about economics. The professor, who’d just eaten dinner with his family, was a little surprised, but answered the question.
It turned out that the student wasn’t even in his class. It was just someone using his textbook at UC Berkeley who decided
to call up the author.
Mankiw was not upset. “It only happened once,” he explains.
The unassuming hearthrob
Ferguson radiates not warmth, but rather, a no-nonsense capability. He is a fan of conservative colors and sharp lines: his suit jacket is done by Sam’s Tailor in Hong Kong and his tie is silk. Ferguson never smiles in photos. The camera loves him anyway, particularly his perpetually roguish and brooding gaze; sometimes he’s grabbing his hair as if decoding a historical conundrum. He’s made appearances on the Colbert Report and presented a television series on his book, “War of the World.” Some zealous fan uploaded it to YouTube even though it required them to slice it into 30 parts. Part one out of 30 received over 8,000 hits. Another video of him speaking has a commenter swooning, “i love sexy intelligent british men.”  His Facebook fanpage has 1,137 members.
He has no clue about any of this.
As for the fanpage, he deems the entire affair rather “silly.” Ferguson’s style of popularity is more hands off than Mankiw’s, and he cultivates adoration through his visibility in the media. He muses that he should, however, update his website.
Ferguson is known for his revisionist accounts of history that have earned as much controversy as attention. He is a supporter of counterfactual history—asking “what if” questions on what could have happened. Unlike Mankiw, he’s not camera shy, has done interviews on Charlie Rose, and has four television documentaries based on his works.
That, combined with “unbelievable” lectures leaves soon-to-be research assistant Manuel J. Antunes ’11 a little starstruck. “For me to see him up close is like watching a celebrity,” Antunes says.
“I think his fanbase comes from the scholarship he’s done,” he says, but concedes, “He’s new blood. He’s young and on TV. I can understand why people have crushes on him.”
Evelyn D. Chow ’12 agrees with Antunes that the cult surrounding Ferguson is based more on admiration and less on fanaticism. “I don’t think people worship the ground he walks on,” she says. “If I were to make a comparison, with the way people kind of idolize Greg Mankiw, i’m not sure if you’d find that same level of idolatry [with Ferguson].”
Ferguson says he gets recognized about once a week, but places his fame in context. “I have a very clear understanding that I’m not famous,” he says, “I’m just a professor who occasionally appears on TV.”
Beyond his television appearances, his image also might have something to do with it. Speculating on precisely what lights an aspiring academic’s fire, sophomore Danello says, “There’s a romantic thing. I think a lot of people see Niall as an embodiment of a certain academic lifestyle called the ‘Oxford dean’ ...a friend of mine has told me on multiple occasions that he has a man crush [on Ferguson],” he says, but keeps mum on the crusher’s identity.
He adds, “I can’t say if it’s the accent or the sharply tailored suit, but perhaps people spend more time looking at him than looking at his suit.”
Still, Ferguson is quick to dismiss his own celebrity and emphasizes that ideas are the real currency in his world.
“The author is not the message. The books are the message,” he says. “I’m actually a very boring person. How do you think I write all these books? I spend all my time writing them.”
The BPF: Best Prof Forever
Robert Lue could put even the most nervous of freshman at ease. He has an easy smile and a faint Jamaican accent, a souvenir of where he grew up, although his parents are from the UK. He wears jeans and a polo. This director of the Life Sciences curriculum teaches the premed staple Life Sciences 1a, where he thrills freshmen with his animations like “Inner Life of a Cell,” a gorgeously orchestrated view of the miniature workings of a cell. Lue, even more than Mankiw or Ferguson, takes a hands-on approach to getting to know his students, perhaps best typified by the stories his students from his summer school program tell.
Sisi Pan ’11 says that Lue was both a professor and friend during the Shanghai summer school program at Fudan University. There, Lue was free for virtually any meal and students felt comfortable dropping by to ask a question or inviting the professor out to sing karaoke with the rest of the group.
During one trip on the outskirts if Xi’an, the group discovered Lue’s playful side.
“There were these sketchy bumper cars in this place that we stayed,” Pan recalls. “We just had a blast. Rob had this malicious grin on his face the whole time and just smashed into us without any hesitation.”
Pan also says that Lue was often included on e-mails planning social outings. “He would always be one of the first to respond. It was very not weird, even though he’s this big deal professor.”
Social outings might also include drinks with his students, although Lue explains, “One thing that was clear was that people were really responsible. It’s not as if I relaxed my responsibility in the sense of ‘I need to look out for these students.’”
Lue, while maintaining a somewhat lower profile than Ferguson, is well known internationally for his animations. “In New York City, the maître d’ at Pizzeria Uno recognized me from something ABC News did and wanted me to autograph a napkin,” he says with a laugh. A high school biology class also asked for an autograph after reporting they watched the video at the beginning of class everyday.
Lue came across as the most overtly approachable professor. During lectures, his appeal lies in his infectious enthusiasm for the material, says Hong-Gam T. Le ’10, a former student. “He just comes out as naturally likeable. He doesn’t seem to try,” she says.
That approachability also pays off in office hour visits, where groups of 12-15 will drop by to chat, the highest estimate of the three professors featured here. Lue also eats dinner in Annenberg on Tuesday nights where a rotating cast of students will come and dine with him—he usually gets to interact with about 20.
His Facebook fan club numbers 29 and is entirely former Life Sci students. Unlike Mankiw, he doesn’t maintain as strong of an online presence, although during the course of the interview, he finally declared, “You can say that finally, after resisting for years, I was convinced to create a [Facebook] profile.”
Despite the lack of blog or profile, summer school student Baltazar A. Zavala ’11 doesn’t feel deprived of Lue’s personal touch. Zavala says that Lue insisted that his students call him by his first name and even took them on field trips to Shanghai’s art district where he would wow them with his art knowledge. Lue was also with them during down times: on a train ride to Beijing Lue and a bunch of students sat and swapped stories about their lives for hours to pass the time.
Lue’s eclectic expertise doesn’t just extend to art. A surprised former student Mark B. Geyer ’06 recalls that Lue held his own in a conversation about Celtic languages and literature. “Dr. Lue and I then talked about Celtic poetry at our next meeting,” Geyer says.
Lue’s greatest appeal—his approachable persona and personal interactions with students—necessarily mean that while he is well-known for his animations, his most enthusiastic fans will be his own students.
“Academically yummy”
As his lecture draws to a close, the only words that aren’t in Ferguson’s vocabulary, it seems, are “um” or “ah” or “er.” Every once in a while, he’ll lean an elbow on the podium, cross his ankles, and place a hand in his pocket, then lecture from that vantage point. He never misses a beat or misreads his audience, some who didn’t manage to snag a chair.
The hour hand hits 11. After class, he’s immediately surrounded by a small swarm of students. He takes a swig of Peet’s Coffee. He makes his way out with one student glued to his elbow, glowing about how “academically yummy” today’s lesson was.
When he recounts the story of a young man trapping him on the ferry, he displays the kind of wit that made him so popular in the first place.
“I think it was a lesson to my children that fame, even small amounts of fame, can be detrimental,” he says.

Madeleine K. Albright: the first female Secretary of State, professor of Eastern European studies at Georgetown, United States Ambassador to the U.N., and ... serious fashionista? Most people wouldn’t think so, but apparently the word fits Albright to a tee.
For nearly 200 pages in her new memoir, “Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat’s Jewel Box”, Albright illuminates for the reader how her pin and brooch collection has affected her foreign policy. Yes, you read that correctly. In the book, Albright writes that her jewelry collection became, “before long, and without intending it ... a part of [her] diplomatic arsenal.” Now, we all know that jewelry makes a statement, but it’s hard to believe that the first thing running through most politicians’ minds before a meeting with Saddam Hussein would be “Which brooch would scare him away first?”
Some students agree that Albright’s enthusiasm for jewelry diminishes her seriousness as a politician. “For her diplomatic skills to be ‘pinned’ on a brooch collection is as ridiculous as George W. Bush’s 8-year presidency,” says Marco Cianflone ’13. Other students think that the book seems like a refreshing break from most stuffy political memoirs. “I, for one, usually buy books written by a dead people, but I actually might read this book,” says Jonathan P. Hawley ’10. “It sounds fun. Any way a politician can make their work more interesting, the better it is.”
Whether this book is a welcome departure from the ordinary political memoir, or a silly attempt to renew Albright’s image in the public eye, it has certainly depicted Albright in a new light. She might not be the average American woman, but, as Caitlin N. Lewis ’13 says, “diamonds are a girl’s best friend” and Albright is no different.
Maybe there is some merit to Albright’s belief in the power of jewelry. In her memoir, she recalls that at her meeting with Saddam Hussein and Iraqi officials, she wore a serpent pin with a dagger through it. Zing.

When you hear the name “Pfoho Closet Beer Club,” several unwholesome images may spring to mind. Don’t worry: this club, founded by Ryan K. Schell ’11, has the support of Pfoho tutors as well as HoCo and is actually made up of people who brew their own beer. The brewing just happens to be taking place in a closet.
Schell was inspired to form the club when he found the words “Brew Closet” written on an actual closet in the Bell Tower suite. Since he has brewing experience and a spot on HoCo as social chair, he decided to combine his two interests.
“I enjoy beer, and I feel like other people do, too, so I decided to create a club where we brew our own,” Schell says, “I thought it would bring the house together and foster house pride.”
After his initial discovery of the closet inscription, he sought approval from his House tutor and presented his plan to rest of the HoCo, which gave him a grant to pay for the supplies. Schell plans to meet with anyone interested in participating, and to present the finished product at a future Stein Club.
According to Schell, about 20 people have already expressed interest in getting involved. When asked what he thought of the proposal, Alex B. Lipton ’11 exclaimed, “Student entrepreneurship and beer? Who could ask for more?”
Papa R. Chakravarthy ’12, who had already heard about the idea, was supportive of both this initiative and the HoCo in general.
“I think Pfoho is very welcoming to new ideas, and the members and the leadership do a great job being inclusive to the rest of the house,” he says.
Schell may be starting the next big trend in Stein Club themes. Now he needs to plan the recipe for the Pfoho signature brew.

When all else fails, blame the tourists. The online Idea Bank, Harvard College and FAS’s newest brainchild, launched last week. In the words of Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, transmitted via e-mail to students across campus, the project aims “to creatively [resolve] Harvard’s budget deficit problems”— and it doesn’t disappoint this reliable mantra.
As a venue for students to submit ideas for reducing costs and generating revenues, the Idea Bank seemed to be the perfect place to target the obvious cause of Harvard’s budget issues: the plentiful population of tourists colonizing Harvard Yard.
One student labeled a tourist trap as a “win-win. If tourists pay, we have a constant revenue stream. If not, then we have fewer tourists in the Yard.” Another called for a pay-as-you-go system for entrance to Annenberg since tourists “always manage to get inside no matter how hard the staff tries to keep them out.” (Editor’s Note: We’ve been scoped while eating in this hallowed hall).
Whereas some proposed closings or cutbacks at Harvard sites ranging from the information center to departments to dining halls, one Bank visitor wanted to extend thriftiness to the most intimate of student hangouts—and no, we don’t mean the plan to go old-school, circa 1636, and reopen the fireplaces to save on the heating bill. Instead, one anonymous contributor boldly suggested, “Make people buy their own toilet paper.”
Huh. The Harvard Green Initiative has lauded the effectiveness of limiting napkin dispensers in the dining hall to reduce waste and cut costs.  Take away napkin dispensers and less people use napkins. Take away toilet paper and... well, maybe in the interest of cleanliness, the administration shouldn’t accept that advice in concert with these Bank ideas: “People can clean their own bathrooms” and the proposed dumping of Dorm Crew.
What were the most popular suggestions? Fees for postering? Bursting the Stadium “Bubble”?
Nah, the Bank’s biggest hits seemed pretty tame in comparison.  Many voters think we shouldn’t “Make it rain” (outside of Pfoho of course) and liked the proposal from Josh M. Zagorsky ’08 to turn off the sprinklers… when it’s already raining.  Meanwhile, a whopping 146 students agreed that closed buildings like the MAC shouldn’t stay lit all night long.
Perhaps Nelly Furtado isn’t the only one who wants to “Turn off the lights.”

“You’re fired!”
R. Breffny Morgan ’08, Harvard’s own candidate in the second season of The Apprentice Ireland, has been fortunately spared these two words. So far.
The show premiered this season on September 21 and follows 14 candidates on different business challenges on their quest to become the apprentice of Bill Cullen, an Irish Donald Trump of sorts. Morgan has survived two eliminations in Cullen’s boardroom.
An avid oarsman, Morgan concentrated in biology while at Harvard, but also discovered a love for entrepreneurship. Before being cast in the show, the Cork native worked as a personal trainer and started a company that sold discarded produce from grocery stores at reduced rates.
Since then, he’s moved onto Ireland’s nighttime television, and frankly, friends are not surprised. “His personality is hard to miss in a crowd and I sort of expected [this show] to be something he would pursue,” says fellow rower Teddy W. Schreck ’09, who is also a former Crimson Magazine writer.
Other friends from Morgan’s Harvard days consider him the ideal Irish Apprentice. The discipline and competitive spirit Morgan learned from years on Harvard’s crew team may be helping him stay afloat. But friends do point to potential pitfalls. “If there are any weaknesses, it’s if he has any romantic interests on the show that get in the way,” explains George A. Kitovitz IV ’08.
Morgan can also irk his contenders by frequently dropping the H-bomb, according to friend Megan E. Carey ’08.But if all else fails, Carey feels Morgan may be able to resort to other qualities. “I feel like a lot of people [on campus] knew him for his accent and his slammin’ bod.”

In 1991, the first annual Ig Nobel Prizes were awarded for discoveries “that cannot, or should not, be reproduced.” 19 years later, the Igs, as they’re lovingly referred to, are still being awarded for improbable (and bizarre) research findings. FM attended last week’s awards in Sanders Theatre. The scene was chaotic, uncomfortable, but nonetheless amusing as answers to questions we never knew we had were answered and old wives’ tales debunked (don’t worry, you can keep cracking your knuckles; if laureate Donald L. Unger didn’t get arthritis after 60 years of constant knuckle cracking, you won’t be getting it anytime soon either).  Between the man—excuse me, human spotlight—wearing only silver body paint, sneakers, and a Speedo, not to mention the ongoing poker game, the mini-opera, and the constant multilingual interruptions, FM was not sure what to make of the corybantic stage. However, the crowd loved every minute of the ceremony, cheering every time the word “risk”—this year’s theme—was uttered.  Acceptance speeches were humorous and mercifully short, and when they weren’t, a young girl, “Miss Sweetie Poo”, marched across the stage to indicate that it was time for the laureates to wrap up. “Please stop, I’m bored. Please stop, I’m bored,” she repeated. The highlight of the Igs? Watching Elena N. Bodnar, this year’s Ig Nobel Public Health Laureate, attempt to wrap her brassiere-turned-gas-masks around the faces of (real) Nobel Laureates Wolfgang Ketterle, Orhan Pamuk, and Paul R. Krugman. Did we mention she had been wearing that very bra? What good sports.  “If you didn’t win an Ig Nobel prize tonight—and especially if you did—better luck next year,” said MC Marc Abrahams. Bewildered, FM couldn’t agree more as we quickly escaped through the nearest exit.

“It’s like transferring from Gryffindor to Ravenclaw to Slytherin,” a friend told me once. “You just don’t do it.” I swear I’m not a psycho. I get along fairly well with others. I’m not a serial sexile-er. But when I tell people that I am currently living in my third Harvard House in as many years, you can imagine the puzzled reaction. What’s worse is that when faced with the inevitable question that follows—an emphatic “Why?”—I still have trouble coming up with a good reason. It all began on Housing Day 2007. Blocking group 226 had valiantly participated in all of the requisite River Run shenanigans (back in the days when HUPD stayed on the sidelines). We were hunkered down in a cold Hollis room, slap happy and looking rather disheveled from staying up all night when the letter finally arrived. We tore open the envelope to learn that we were Matherites. Now, naïve freshman that I was, I hadn’t so much as laid eyes upon Mather House until the previous night’s housing revelry and didn’t have much of an opinion about it. I happily rummaged through my goodie bag to find my “Singles for Life!” condoms and decided that it was going to be a good House. The first of many. That fall, I settled in to the concrete jungle without much fanfare. The shuttle and I became very close friends; by the end of the year I’d learned how to wake up at 9:45 and be sitting in Sever before the Mem Church bells even stopped ringing. My single was glorious. The dining hall was amazing. My fellow Matherites were wild and crazy in the best of ways. In hindsight, there was obviously no reason to leave, but I decided to throw caution to the wind (hey, this was the pre-financial-crisis era, everyone was doing it) and transferred. I had no specific direction, and only cursorily ranked my preferences on the transfer application. Is experiencing the uncertainty of Housing Day for a second time cheating the system? Maybe. But was it worth it? You betcha.Junior year found me in Lowell. Ah, the model House of the entire system. As a transfer, I had the luck of ending up in a senior double (while my fellow natural-born Lowellian juniors still languished in maze-like walkthroughs). Once again I quickly adjusted to the quirks of a new home. In no time I had made friends with scuttling critters and mastered the art of sleeping through Sunday morning’s bells. I was spoiled with Master’s teas, lavish formals, and a dining-hall-turned-Opera-house. As spring semester rolled around, however, I found myself sans blockmates and with the prospect of losing senior status in the upcoming rooming lottery. What’s a floater to do? Transfer again, naturally.Transferring a second time seemed easier than getting a party form signed, and just like that I was destined for Kirkland. Moving in this fall was admittedly ridiculous. My storage boxes were plastered with three separate Houses’ identification stickers. I assumed my fourth and final mailing address of my college career. For the first time since freshman year, I was living in a common room. But re-adjusting yet another time was beyond worth it. Kirkland welcomed me, as the other Houses had, with open arms, and by now I feel like I’ve lived there forever. Any Matherites reading this are probably scandalized at this point, but Jerk-land honestly isn’t half bad. Harvard housing made me realize once and for all that I’m an experience addict. Many have said that since randomization went into effect, the Houses no longer each have a distinct character. If you are inclined to believe this, then perhaps you haven’t lived in three of them. Looking back, each House felt in a certain sense like going to a separate school—the differences were that noticeable. People often point out that I will have missed out on a core element of the Harvard experience—that of fully embracing one’s House community. But in reality, I think I’ve just experienced three times as much of it.  When it comes to being apart from my biological blockmates, it’s tough. But there’s something to be said for having to make an effort—I can’t just count on the ease of them being in proximity by default. And my ever-growing consortium of adopted blockmates and linkmates makes this campus seem to be continually shrinking. Living in every River neighborhood was something I would repeat again without a doubt, if only for the sake of experience. Abbott Lawrence Lowell is probably spinning in his grave (I think I’ve violated every ideal of his House system brainchild), but I make no apologies. Look out Quad, you might be next. —James A. McFadden ’10, a Crimson editorial writer, is a government concentrator in Mather House Lowell House Kirkland House.

One year after we watched Al Gore ’69 extol the virtues of sustainability to the Harvard community, hot cider and apple pie clutched in our palms, the flags in the yard are taken down, the free t-shirts are shoved in the bottom of our dressers, and you might be wondering: is green still the new Crimson?Thanks to the Office For Sustainability (OFS), the undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program (REP), and the cooperation of the University and students, it is. The flags and t-shirts may be gone, but the blue recycling bins remain stacked in every dorm, and it’s hard to find a toilet on campus without a bright green dual-flush handle. Beyond these colors shouting at you to live a “greener” life, though, the biggest contributors to sustainability aren’t necessarily our personal efforts, but instead the buildings we live and work in. The big push this year is green building, and with the 20th Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification of a Harvard facility, we’re well on our way to a greener university.Harvard’s current LEED projects represent upwards of 1,000,000 square feet of space and savings of $680,000 and 1,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Harvard’s 20 LEED certifications take the win for any institution of higher education—more than the rest of the Ivy League combined and, for you fans of rivalry, three times more certifications than Yale.“Green building is important because Harvard’s more than 700 existing buildings contribute the bulk of our emissions today,” says Heather A. Henriksen, Director of OFS. “And new buildings will add new emissions, no matter how efficient they are,” .To be LEED-certified, buildings must be environmentally friendly in terms of sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy performance, materials, and indoor environmental quality. While all new buildings and renovations planned at Harvard will follow LEED guidelines, it would be impossible to tear down the buildings in Harvard Yard, which is protected as a historic district, in the name of the environment. Instead, the OFS works with buildings in the Yard and the Houses from the inside.“Despite the challenges of working with existing historic buildings, we have been able to achieve success in energy conservation while preserving both the embodied energy in the existing structure and the historic face of Harvard and Cambridge,” writes Nathan Gauthier, an Assistant Director of OFS, in an e-mail to The Crimson. As a result, Harvard won the Charles W. Eliot Award for organizations with exceptional vision and excellence in planning. Harvard is currently waiting for the U.S. Green Building Council to confirm 139-year-old Thayer Hall as its first LEED-certified dorm. However, the freshmen of Thayer will also be the last dorm residents to receive a plaque in the near future.“We are not going to pursue LEED-EB (the certification intended for existing buildings) for the rest of the dorms at this time,” says Jay M. Phillips, Director of Energy, Sustainability and Infrastructure in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Physical Resources. “Instead, we will take the best practices from the LEED process and apply them to the other dorms without going for the formal certification.”According to Anthony Pacillo, Senior Manager of Harvard Yard and Freshman Dormitories, increasing sustainability in the dorms is a complex process which includes installing dual-flush toilets, motion sensor lighting, water-saving showerheads, and increased recycling. As Pacillo says, it’s an effort to do “basically whatever we can possibly do in the buildings.”Despite budget cuts this year, OFS is still aggressively pursuing green building. Gauthier conservatively estimates at least ten more plaques by the time the class of 2010 graduates; most of these certifications will result from renovations rather than new buildings.To help with meet this challenge, OFS has enlisted the help of students in each house and dorm through REP for efforts on an individual level. “REP Reps” work to spread environmental awareness and encourage recycling, double-sided printing, and reducing waste on a day-to-day basis. Rachel H. Mak ’10, a student captain of REP, applauded the college for getting rid of the printed CUE Guide and emphasized other contributions that students can make just by reducing waste. “Right now Harvard has a recycling rate of 55%, and that’s pretty good,” she says. “But we could definitely work to increase that and educate students on what is recyclable and what isn’t.”While we can’t all be as effortly sustainable as Thayerites, FAS, which includes the College, can be proud to claim the most LEED projects of any of Harvard’s schools, with one certification and 26 registered buildings. Moreover, there are additional smaller projects such as the nation’s first LEED-certified kitchen in Dunster and Mather. You may not be standing in an official “green” building yet, but chances are that at least part of it has reduced Harvard’s environmental footprint.

My Uncle Deard died last week of natural causes. I know because my mom texted me—texted, in fact, my entire family in a single, well-intentioned, poorly-executed, grossly inappropriate text message. Poorly executed because I don’t have an Uncle Deard. That was a typo. Inappropriate, because I have an Uncle Mike; an Uncle Mike who died last week of natural causes. I know because my mom then texted me an asterisk. Followed by the word “dead.” Followed by the words “your uncle Mike is dead.” The next day, my aunt sent me an Evite to his wake and my dad linked the announcement on my Facebook wall. It’s 2009. Pandora doesn’t have a box. She has an unlimited texting plan on her AT&T compatible iPhone—she lends it to my dad, and with it, he guilts me about my future with greater speed, mobility, and convenience than ever before. In equipping our parents with new social technology, we’ve awoken a sleeping giant, and we’ve only ourselves to blame.  Our techno magic simply made them too jealous. These mere Muggles of the Baby Boomer birth squad were kept in the dark too long; forced to admire our sorcery from an ignorant distance too long. When they tried to count their phone’s blueteeth, we laughed.When they got their ties hilariously caught in fax machines, we howled. But all this joking shamed them, and like little technological flagellators whipping themselves into submission, they finally shaped up, rewiring themselves both inside and out with the necessary technical equipment.  But as dated reference William Hung taught us, just because you have the equipment doesn’t mean you know how to use it. The simple truth is that Mom and Dad’s technological crash course only taught them competency, not ethics or customs. The few for-adult-by-adult efforts to explain the ethical nuances of social technology have come up short. In an article that made the blog rounds this summer, New York Times writer Alex Williams tried to write a “do’s and don’ts” guide for adults and social technology. But guides like these only focus on integrating technology into your life. They don’t explain why it is creepy to Facebook friend your son’s classmates, or why it is not okay to Gchat until the second date. But these nuances are important. Technology in untrained hands can be dangerous. You need a license to own an assault rifle, but you can launch Internet assaults without so much as a learner’s permit.  So here’s my attempt at one. An adult’s guide to social technology etiquette by a guy who tries harder each day to convince himself he’s not an adult. Texting The medium is for brevity. Passive aggressiveness is fine, but it must be achieved through emoticons and not 1,000 character-long treatises on the perks of a career in law. Oh, yeah, and no death texts.E-mail For the love of God, stop the forwarding. Just…just stop. No more dogs dressed like married couples.  No more poems that point out why “Guidance” is like “God—“u” and “i” dance.

The annual Ig Nobel Prizes, held to honor practitioners of unconventional scientific research, also spotlighted another kind of unusual star this past Thursday in Sanders Theater. Besides featuring a group of scientists who discovered a method to create a diamond out of tequila, the honor of cutest participant in the ceremony undoubtedly goes to eight-year-old Isabel Kadel-Garcia, known for the evening as "Miss Sweetie Poo."
Winners of Ig Nobel prizes are allowed a one-minute acceptance speech. Every year, if and when they go over the limit, Miss Sweetie Poo walks up to them and whines, "Please stop. I’m bored." According to Isabel’s mother, Rachel Kadel-Garcia ’98, "it takes a few repetitions before she is successfully dismissed." Two to three girls from the Boston area audition each year for the coveted role.
"Miss Sweetie Poo is always great," said event organizer Marc Abrahams, "but Isabel is really something." Isabel has appeared in ballet performances and a television commercial, although she enjoyed the role of Miss Sweetie Poo the most.
In the commercial, "I was told to do this, and do that, and do this, and I got a bit cranky," she admits. She was allowed more freedom at the Ig Nobel ceremony. "I really did like it when Marc said, ‘Isabel, you’ve done enough now,’ even though he knew that I wasn’t going to stop," she says.
Every year, recipients of the Prizes shower Miss Sweetie Poo with gifts in attempt to get more air-time. This year’s included milk, a stuffed cow, a sombrero and a bottle of tequila. "It was bad milk," Isabel observed. "I liked the sombrero, but they wouldn’t let me keep it. I don’t know what they did with the wine. They wouldn’t let me take it home for Mommy and Daddy to drink."
If only we could bring Miss Sweetie Poo to lecture with us.

Think Boston Red Sox shirts and cargo shorts are the extent of Bostonians’ fashion sense? Has seeing the same American Apparel dress on every Harvard girl got you jaded? Wondering where the beautiful people in Boston have gone (or, better yet, if they even exist)? Well, believe it or not, Boston has actually spent the last two weeks celebrating its very own, albeit less glamorous, version of Fashion Week.
Though we aren’t exactly on the heels of New York, Paris, or Milan (they are five-inch stilettos after all), fashion experts around Boston contend that this is not the goal of fashion week. "I think the future of Boston Fashion Week is to be Boston Fashion Week," says Jay Calderin, who founded the event in 1995.
Surveying the scene at the Daniela Corte fashion show Friday night, it becomes readily apparent that we’re not in New York any more. The "list" is a collection of Daniela’s ardent supporters rather than a weapon of mass humiliation; the models look like your really stunning next door neighbor rather than a really stunning display of bones; and the fashion crowd even includes a group of pre-teens pouting for their mom’s camera.
The best thing about these local pros, besides the fact that they can rock a Red Sox hat by day and designer dresses by night, is that they recognize our large contribution to Boston’s fashion street cred. Meghan A. Mills, co-owner of Serenella, a Newbury boutique, loves watching college kids come into her store. "They’re trendy—less hipster than New York. They step it up…I’m sort of jealous," laments the Bryant University graduate who remembers Doc Martens being all the rage around the time of her graduation.
Still, most agree that we should leave the designing to the designers. "That’s kind of hysterical," Abba M. Binns, one of the models who dominated the Boston runways, says of Harvard’s attempt to create its own fashion line.
So, with Boston putting its stamp on all sorts of genres—drinks, fashion, sports—show your Beantown pride and change out of that Harvard sweatshirt you’ve been wearing the past four days in a row. The tourists and the Coop may be disappointed, but Boston’s fashion crowd will surely thank you for it.

Halloween’s just around the corner, and to get into the spooky spirit, FM hiked to Mount Auburn Cemetery. A series of Monument Inscription Workshops are held monthly in the graveyard’s historic quarter where, crouched down beside weathered headstones, volunteers learn the ins and outs of deciphering and recording the century-old epitaphs.
With an ongoing preservation initiative, the cemetery plans to record the inscriptions of all its 19th century inhabitants, from Victorian hotshots (like poet Henry W. Longfellow, cookbook author Fannie Farmer, and clergyman and Harvard alum Phillips Brooks) to its less notable grave-dwellers.
"The project is important because the inscriptions are deteriorating," Education and Visitor Services Assistant Jessica A. Bussman said.
The recording is no easy task. With marble gravestones dating back to the 1800s, words have been wind-whipped to smears and many numbers are barely recognizable. Nonetheless, the cemetery staff and active body of ten volunteers read on, determined to decode every last name and date.
"They really tell the stories of the people they’re commemorating," Bussman said of the inscriptions.
Volunteers and staff use flashlights and mirrors to help decipher the worn lettering. Or, when all else fails, they turn to Google books to fill in missing poems or biblical quotes.
"I enjoy [the project] in the same way I like crossword puzzles and other puzzles—it’s fun!" Bussman said.
And what better place for a fun activity than the old bone yard? Though it may seem creepy to camp out in the cemetery, volunteers appear unfazed.
"Some people do have an interest in the macabre," Preservation and Facilities Manager Natalie M. Wampler said. "But I think more come for the horticulture and the history. Most people don’t come to do odd things."
"I don’t ever find it morbid," volunteer Jennifer D. Losciuto said. "I don’t ever feel frightened at all—well, if I was here by myself at night, maybe..."
Students interested in preservation work should look out for follow-up events in the Mount Auburn Cemetery Web site, before they’re buried alive under mountains of homework.

Last Thursday, at approximately 12:58 P.M., students could be seen casually kicking back in the citrus-colored common spaces chairs on the green in front of the John Harvard statue. At 1:03, to the shock of the tourists amongst them and unsuspecting students rushing to class, the sound of dance music shook the yard. For the next 15 minutes, the yard was awhirl with color and flailing limbs as students broke it down and then walked away like nothing had happened.
Bystander Linda H. Chao ’10 could only call it a “hilarious dance fest,” but even many of the participants were unaware that the A.R.T. organized the “flash mob” as part of a new theatrical initiative. A.R.T. Artistic Fellow Allegra E. Libonati describes the event as “community outreach based on spontaneous moments of theatrical joy. It’s bending the definition of theater.”
The A.R.T. rallied participants through vague instructions in an email circulated around campus. According to student facilitator Ilan J. Caplan ’09, “People can create these spontaneous joyful moments just about anywhere.”
The event was joyful but also fiercely competitive. When the music stopped, students piled onto chairs in a struggle of survival of the fittest.
Elizabeth B. Graber ’11, an enthusiastic dancer who made it to the later rounds of play, had a clear strategy for success. “When in doubt, swing dance. If that doesn’t work, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.”
According to Webster, members of a flash mob “assemble in a public place, do something bizarre, and disperse.” Harvard is now part of a vibrant flash mob tradition, which includes the 4,000-person Silent Disco on the London underground in 2006, and the 5,000-person pillow fight in New York City in 2008.
Missed out on musical chairs? Student instigator Eve H. Bryggman ’10 hints that there may be more spontaneous theatrical joy to come. “If you didn’t make it, don’t worry. All I can say is: don’t get your hopes…down.”

“High seriousness is the enemy of intelligent thought,” says Robert Joseph “R. J.” Jenkins of his personal teaching philosophy. As the Head Teaching Fellow for the extremely popular English 154: “Literature and Sexuality,” Jenkins is known for his charismatic, candid teaching style, 24-7 availability to his students, and outspoken opposition to the traditional response paper, a commonplace assignment at Harvard which he calls a “soul destroying genre.” Jenkins’ refreshingly irreverent classroom methods have made him so popular that he seems to have become one of the main attractions of the course.
Jenkins divides his time between serving as a TF, a tutor at Lowell House, the Director of Sophomore Advising, and a Ph.D. candidate. Studying primate biology as an undergraduate at Columbia University, Jenkins never expected to end up where he is today. But after contracting malaria during a research trip to Kenya, Jenkins decided to switch to literature to feed his obsession with the Victorian novel. Though the two topics seem unrelated, Jenkins sees a clear connection. “In both disciplines, you are searching for great significance in the tiniest details, great meaning in minute actions and things,” he says.
Making connections, especially with students, is one of Jenkins’ specialties. “My life is as ridiculous and full of foolishness as the lives of my students,” he explains. He recalls an incident last year when, late to class, he hastily hooked up his computer to the projector, only to display his desktop background—a flirty picture of Jake Gyllenhaal—onto the screen. “Instead of acting embarrassed, I greeted him. ‘Why hello Jake! Class, meet Jake. Jake, class’” Jenkins recalls. “Teachers are human beings too.”
Chava E. Kenny ’12, a student in his English 154 section last year, explains, “R. J. can always make you laugh or smile.” Kenny acknowledges that Jenkins has had a significant impact on her academically. “He helps you along with your ideas,” she says, “without forcing anything on you. And he completely changed my approach to writing papers.” Jenny J. Lee ’10, an English concentrator who took his Junior Tutorial last year, agrees that Jenkins is one-of-a-kind. “R. J. is the kind of person you would want to be at your wedding,” she says.
Assistant Professor of English Matthew B. Kaiser, who teaches English 154, also appreciates Jenkins’ exceptional teaching methods. “R. J. is my platonic ideal of a TF,” Kaiser said in an e-mail. “He teaches from a place of love and joy,” he said, “not a place of control and discipline. That’s why students respect and admire him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square’s Bombay Club, which has been serving Indian food on JFK St. for 18 years, will move to the South End in early November due to declining sales and a financial dispute with a landlord who has tried to evict Bombay Club in the past.
While restaurant owner Vinod Kapoor has been embroiled in a lawsuit with landlord Raj Dhanda in a dispute over common area maintenance charges since February, sales have dipped approximately 40 percent in the past year, Kapoor said.
Dhanda has planned to evict both Bombay Club and Om Restaurant and Lounge—which is also housed in the Crimson Galleria and filed for bankruptcy this summer—for some time, Grub Street Boston reported in July.
Dhanda told Grub Street Boston, a food and restaurant blog, that both restaurants were in “very serious financial default,” that Bombay Club hadn’t paid rent for “a number of months” and that several of the restaurant’s checks had bounced.
Kapoor said that he has withheld about five to six months’ worth of rent—though not consecutively—in order to try to negotiate a deal with Dhanda outside of court.
According to Kapoor, the rent in Bombay Club’s new space in the South End, roughly $10,000 per month, is one-third of the rent he currently pays for the space in Harvard Square.
Additionally, both Kapoor and Solmon Chowdhury—who owns Om restaurant next door—said that Dhanda has been charging tenants for common building space maintenance at rates that are far above average.
Some professors and students said they regret seeing the Bombay Club go.
Religion professor Diana L. Eck said that when the Faculty Club was closed for renovations a few years ago, “Bombay Club sort of became the Faculty Club.”
Jack Bardy—the owner of the South End restaurant Pho Republique, which will vacate its space for the Bombay Club by November—said that though rents in Harvard Square are particularly high, the sales are no better than “in the rest of the city where the rents are significantly lower.”
Students who said they were fond of Bombay Club admitted they eat there only occasionally.
Danielle J. Lee ’11 said that she ate at the restaurant only once or twice per year—either for friends’ birthdays or to take visiting friends out.
Anjali M. Bhatt ’11, a South Asian Association board member, noted that Bombay Club faces competition from three other Harvard Square Indian restaurants—Tanjore, Cafe of India, and Tamarind Bay.
“The student population is looking for just cheap good food,” said Bhatt.
Kapoor said that the new location would be more casual in order to increase its appeal.
Kapoor, who has been searching for a new restaurant space for the past two years, said that he still hopes to move the restaurant back to Cambridge.
“I’ll be missing this place because the crowd at Harvard is very educated,” said Kapoor, who immigrated to Mass. from New Delhi in 1978 and has been in the restaurant business since 1981. “I think I’ll have to start from scratch, but I’ll make it.”

Harvard’s Houghton Library announced earlier this week that it will acquire the John Updike Archive—an extensive collection of Updike’s original manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, and files, including documents that the author had kept private.
Updike ’54, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, died in January.
“It’s hard to imagine 20th century literature without thinking of Updike as a major part of it,” said Leslie A. Morris, the curator of modern books and manuscripts at Houghton Library.
The Library had previously acquired a part of Updike’s records, when he gave Harvard several manuscripts before the 1970s, when a tax law changed that prohibited tax deductions for donations of personal archives, according to Morris.
After the change in tax law, Updike continued to deposit his personal archives and work at the Houghton Library, though Updike maintained full control over access to these documents.
According to Morris, he allowed researchers access to his work for purposes of literary criticism, but he wanted his personal correspondence kept private.
“This collection will enable teaching and research that will not just enrich our understanding of a distinguished writer and his work, but will also provide insights into the literary craft and its place in late 20th century America,” Harvard University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement.
Updike indicated in his will that he wanted the remainder of his archive to go to Harvard, though the University had to pay an undisclosed amount of money to Updike’s literary trust to complete the acquisition.
Rodney G. Dennis, Morris’s predecessor, first approached Updike about the future of his archive over 40 years ago, and Updike began depositing his work at Harvard shortly thereafter.
“[Updike] was a scholarship kid and I think Harvard was a very different place from where he had grown up,” Morris said. “He appreciated the opportunities he had here.”
After moving to New York for about two years after graduating, Updike returned to Massachusetts to live just an hour away from Harvard Yard until he died, according to Morris.
Updike gave lectures and printed some of his poems at Harvard. He carried a Harvard Library card until his death.
Morris said some of the more unexpected materials include Updike’s childhood work, including a copy of a short story he had submitted to the New Yorker with the rejection slip attached to the front.
Updike originally hoped to be a cartoonist and pursued the interest as president of the Harvard Lampoon. Some of his self-portraits from this time reveal “a move private side of Updike that hasn’t been seen before,” Morris said.
Houghton Library may hire additional staff and experts to assist in the sorting and cataloguing process, which Morris said is slated to take up to two years. After the process is finished, students and researchers will have full access to the new materials.

Harvard’s Chief Information Officer Daniel D. Moriarty announced Monday his intentions to step down at the end of this month after a decade of leading the University’s technology development efforts.
Moriarty leaves behind a legacy of streamlining IT operations and centralizing procurement—efforts that now save the University over $26 million a year, according to a statement from University Provost Steven E. Hyman.
In Moriarty’s e-mail to his staff announcing his resignation, he did not provide a reason for stepping down, stating only that he is “look[ing] forward to new challenges,” but planned to help Harvard through the transition process as University administrators search for his successor.
Since his arrival at Harvard as an associate dean of the Medical School in 1993, Moriarty has worked to introduce the latest technology at Harvard.
Under his leadership, the University also adopted the iSites platform, which professors and students use to upload course materials or finished assignments online.
“He was always so easy to work with and brought people together,” said John D. Halamka, Moriarty’s successor as Harvard Medical School’s chief information officer. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen Dan unhappy or angry—he was very levelheaded.”
Halamka, who worked closely with his predecessor both while he was at the Medical School and most recently in central administration, said that Moriarty centralized Harvard’s telecommunication system and pushed for security measures to decrease the risk of privacy breaches.
His departure follows that of Lawrence M. Levine, former chief information officer of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences who left at the end of last month to head IT at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Moriarty described in the e-mail that his resignation presents Harvard and new leadership with the opportunity to “refresh and refocus” and “take things forward.
Though University administrators have not specified plans related to IT infrastructure and development, Halamka said that it is especially important in this economy for IT units across Harvard to “get together and coordinate approaches” to improve efficiency.
Moriarty, who worked in the software development industry prior to his appointment at Harvard, also launched the faculty Instructional Innovation Funds, the Harvard Academic Computing Committee, and the Presidential Instructional Technology Fellows program during his tenure at Harvard.
His deputy, Susan Walsh, will serve as interim chief information officer while administrators search for a replacement.
Moriarty did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.

The Harvard University Police Department will welcome two veteran officers from the Boston and Cambridge forces as its new deputy chiefs of operations.
The hiring of James Claiborne and Michael Giacoppo for the newly-created role is part of HUPD’s ongoing restructuring in response to feedback—including the recommendations of a committee convened last year to address alleged racial profiling by the university police.
Giacoppo started as an officer in the MIT Police Department, serving for three years. He moved on to the Cambridge Police Department, where he spent 32 years, working his way up to the position of superintendent before retiring in June.
CPD Public Information Officer Frank T. Pasquarello called Giacoppo “the perfect choice for the police department,” citing Giacoppo’s involvement in investigating numerous high-profile crimes in Cambridge.
Elaine B. Driscoll, a spokesperson for the Boston Police Department, said that Claiborne, who comes to Harvard after 30 years in the BPD, “has been a tremendous asset to the Boston Police Department.”
Claiborne said that the “Boston Miracle” of the 1990s, a period that saw large declines in violent crime, was a highlight of his years in the BPD.
“[Commissioner] Paul Evans was the architect [of the ‘Miracle’], and I was his general contractor,” he said. “We organized the entire Boston police. We simply turned it upside down.”
Claiborne has worked in a wide variety of Boston neighborhoods, including Jamaica Plain, the Back Bay, the South End, and Mattapan.
“Harvard will be another neighborhood with its own set of needs, its own set of issues,” he said. “I’ve coped with those in the past, I think pretty well.”
In his time in the BPD, Claiborne attained the position of superintendent in charge of field services, the third-highest position in the police department. At that point, he was the highest-ranking minority member of the BPD, according to the Boston Globe.
He was demoted from this position following the death of Emerson College student Victoria Snelgrove, according to the Globe. Snelgrove was killed at a 2004 Red Sox pennant celebration when a pepper pellet fired by a police officer struck her in the eye.
Driscoll praised Claiborne’s work in his current position in Mattapan, where she said he has “played a major part in decreasing crime and increasing quality of life for residents.” According to the Globe, homicides in the B-3 district, which includes Mattapan and North Dorchester, dropped from 24 in 2007 to 12 in 2008 under Claiborne’s command.
According to an e-mailed statement from HUPD spokesman Steven Catalano, one deputy chief will oversee day-to-day operations on the Allston and Longwood campuses and one will perform the same duties on the Cambridge campus.

The Harvard Business School announced this week the appointment of Nobuo Sato as Executive Director of the Japan Research Center, welcoming him to the HBS Global Initiative community.
Victoria W. Winston, executive director of the HBS Global Initiative, said that she is “thrilled” to welcome Sato to the community, and feels the development of the Global Initiative is critical to the future of HBS.
“As the second-largest economy in the world, Japan continues to be an important source of business innovations and challenges,” Winston wrote in an e-mail. “Nobuo will help to ensure that HBS faculty will have access to the companies and practitioners behind these innovations,” she added.
The Center in Tokyo is one of six across the globe which facilitates understanding of regional companies, organizations, and trends as a resource for HBS faculty members, according to the Global Initiative website.
The Executive Director is responsible for reaching out to business leaders across the region, working with HBS alumni, and navigating a complex web of time zones to communicate with other Centers.
Sato has years of experience in Tokyo’s business world.
Sato, who graduated from HBS in 1982, worked for 15 years at the Industrial Bank of Japan, according to an HBS press release.
Sato then worked for 15 years as a global partner at Egon Zehnder International, an executive search and assessment firm.
He also managed a corporate governance practice group and supervised the firm’s Japan-based industry sector research team.
Sato’s work will extend beyond the borders of Japan.
The Executive Directors of all six Centers gather in Boston at least three times a year to compare “notes on research intelligence, business innovation and best research practices,” according to Winston.
Sato replaced founding Executive Director Masako Egawa, who was appointed managing director for strategic planning at the University of Tokyo.
“We are delighted to hear that Mr. Sato is heading the Japan Research Center in Tokyo,” Associate Director of Harvard’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese studies Theodore J. Gilman wrote in an e-mail.
“He brings a wealth of experience to the position and to Harvard. This is an exciting time to be engaged in Japanese studies, and we look forward to continued collaborative efforts that benefit Harvard faculty and students interested in Japan,” he added.
Sato has already made his presence known at HBS, asking second-year business students to have dinner with him next week, said Soto Yasuda, a student at HBS and co-chair of the Asian Business Conference.
Yasuda said that the Center in Tokyo provides access to contacts who assist in Field Work Projects or Individual Study Projects which second-year students at HBS can elect to engage in.

Congress has been debating health care reform for months, and yesterday evening the dialogue came to Harvard when Jeffrey Crowley, the current White House Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy and Senior Advisor on Disability Policy, spoke to an audience of 50 at the Law School.
The discussion focused mainly on the extent to which the government will be able to provide health care coverage, particularly to those living with HIV/AIDS or disabilities.
Crowley said that comprehensive reform was the key to solving the health care and economic crises.
“We recognize that the status quo is what we need to fear,” Crowley said. “There’s no perfect health care system but we’ve got to start moving in the right direction,” he added.
Forum moderator and Health Law Clinic Director Robert Greenwald said before the event that he viewed the White House as a partner for community and advocacy groups in addressing the AIDS and health care crises. He also noted that the Obama administration is the first to create a specific national AIDS policy.
“You have to have not been paying attention to see that the Obama administration has put health care at the forefront of its agenda,” Greenwald said when introducing Crowley.
“As the health care debates go on we’ve been talking about reforms, but the impacts on people with particular needs such as HIV have not been discussed,” added Petrie-Flom Academic Fellow Allison K. Hoffman.
Crowley’s remarks assumed the audience’s support of health care reform, according to Law School student Michael B. Pilgrim, who thought the discussion was one sided.
“It was hard to separate political theatre from the actual substance of the speech,” Pilgrim said.
The Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, which sponsored the event with HLS’s Health Law Clinic, is also actively engaged with partner health care organizations throughout Boston.
Their outreach attracted many attendees from outside Harvard.
Audience member Betsy Kunkel, who works for the non-profit HIV/AIDS resource center the Boston Living Center, wanted to hear from Crowley about how the administration plans to help the HIV/AIDS community.
“With the economic crisis we’re feeling the pinch terribly,” Kunkel said, adding that she came to the Law School event “looking for hope on the horizon.”

Recognized for years of distinguished literary scholarship and commitment to the African American community, Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. became the first African American recipient of the Sarah Josepha Hale Award.
Presented annually since 1956 by the trustees of the Richards Free Library of Newport, N.H., the award is given to a person of literary stature whose body of work has exhibited a meaningful connection to New England.
Past winners have included filmmaker Ken Burns as well as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin.
“Gates is incredibly interesting and distinguished in literary scholarship and African American studies at Harvard,” said John N. Berry III, editor of the Library Journal and a member of the Board of Judges.
“We think his body of work is very much a part of the fabric of the New England community.”
The award presentation took place in the Newport Opera House, and Gates described it as “a very moving ceremony.”
“I love New England and I’ve been lucky enough to receive many awards, and this is really, truly one of the most memorable,” Gates told the nearly 400 locals of the Newport area who attended the ceremony.
Gates’ connection to the African American community, as well as New England, was noted in presenting him the award, as he is its first African American recipient.
“It was surprising to me that he was the first African American selected,” said Michael C. York, New Hampshire State Librarian and member of the Board of Judges. York said that he was not aware of this until the fact was emphasized in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, particularly in light of controversy surrounding Gates’ arrest this summer.
In July, Gates was mistaken for a burglar when trying to get into his own house after finding the door jammed. The policeman investigating the incident arrested Gates for disorderly conduct when Gates reacted angrily to being mistaken for a burglar in his own home.
Because the Board of Judges for the Sarah Josepha Hale Award choose the following recipient at the awards ceremony the year before, little was said in response to the incident, which aroused media attention nationwide.
“We made this choice because of his work,” York added. “We made an outstanding choice and never even thought about reconsidering it.”
Gates said he was moved to receive recognition for his contribution to the African American and New England communities, and did not see a connection between the award and the events of the summer.
“It is a signal honor in my life, a sign that my life is returning to normal,” he said. “It’s a great for me and I’m humbled by it.”

CORRECTION APPENDED
Professor Jeremy Waldron of New York University gave a series of three lectures on “Dignity and Defamation: The Visibility of Hate” as part of the Holmes Lectures held every three years at the Harvard Law School.
In the series—which was launched in 1954 at the bequest of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes—Waldron covered three general areas each lecture: “Why We Call Hate Speech Group Libel,” “What a Well-ordered Society Looks Like” and “Libel and Legitimacy.”
Giving a contrast between the United States and other developed democratic countries such as Great Britain and Canada, he provided constructive criticism and ideas about hate speech and dignity.
“People in the US are ignorant about laws in other countries,” he said. Waldron pointed to the United States Constitution’s inherent protection of hate speech under the first amendment, calling the US “an outlier” in that it is one of the few nations from those he discussed that overlooks international law prohibiting racial commentaries.
He mentioned that he has “no real optimism towards changing the constitution,” in reference to the “robustly misinterpreted” first amendment that endorses free speech.
But he hoped that the US can perhaps be open-minded and look at constitutions from other countries, expressing the necessity to preserve the dignity of minority groups without compromising free speech.
Waldron began his first lecture by describing a critical rebuke he received in response to his own negative commentary about Antony Lewis’ book “Freedom for the Thoughts that We Hate.”
“You are a totalitarian asshole,” read one of the e-mails he received.
“People of good faith react”, was Waldron’s response. “You must expect some disagreement when talking about inherently controversial matters”.
This was, of course, not the only dissenting opinion expressed in the series. During and after his lecture, his ideals and ways of approaching his claims were challenged by the audience.
“It’s premature to evaluate where he will be taking it”, responded visiting Professor Jim Pfander after the first lecture, dubious of the approach he’s observed thus far.
Some students had even harsher replies. Christopher J. Szabla, a student at Harvard Law School, said that “it is intriguing that he tried to rehash an old theme. But his arguments lack development.”
Despite the harsh reactions, the lecture was highly anticipated.
Rachel Haron expressed enthusiasm since the lecture addressed “issues that are not really discussed in class and are alien to the US constitution and society.”
At the very least, “intriguing”, is a quality most audience members, both those in agreement and against Waldron’s views, attributed to the lecture.
CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Oct. 8 news article "Waldron Gives Holmes Lecture" incorrectly quoted law student Christopher J. Szabla as saying he found it "stimulating" that Professor Jeremy Waldron rehashed an "old theme" in his lectures. In fact, the word Szabla used to describe the theme was "intriguing."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former Harvard Medical School professor and his business partner have been identified as suspects in connection with an alleged art theft case that they brought to the attention of police, and are being investigated for allegedly failing to cooperate with authorities.
Retired Harvard oncologist Ralph Kennaugh and business partner Angelo B. Amadio claimed upwards of $27 million worth of art was stolen from the condo they rented in Pebble Beach, Calif. in a police report filed September 25.
But despite repeated requests for information about the art from the Monterey County Police Department, Amadio and Kennaugh have not responded to inquiries, according to Sheriff Commander Mike Richards, who heads the department.
Richards said Kennaugh and Amadio’s silence has led Richards and his department to suspect something is amiss.
“They are not responding to our request for help, but they are doing media interviews,” Richards said. “It’s all turning into some kind of circus.” He said police suspect “it’s a scam,” adding, “we just don’t know what type yet.”
Amadio protested Richards’s assertions that he and Kennaugh were behaving suspiciously in an interview with the Associated Press.
“We’re just dumbfounded by what the sheriff is saying,” Amadio told the AP. “Why would anyone in their right mind make this up?”
Amadio did not reply to repeated requests for comment from The Crimson. Kennaugh could not be reached for comment.
Kennaugh recently retired from his post as an oncologist at HMS and his appointment at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Kennaugh and Amadio had over 100 pieces in their collection, according to Amadio, and works by Matisse, Rembrandt, Miro, Renoir, and Pollock are among the art that the two allege was stolen.
A Pollock painting most recently valued at $20 million—but that Amadio suggested could be worth up to $80 million—is the most valuable painting of those reported missing, according to The Boston Globe. The set of allegedly stolen artwork, numbering between 25 and 30, was stacked in the hallway of the condo when it was taken, according to Amadio.
Amadio also told the Globe that computer files from his and Kennaugh’s laptops were stolen as well.
The Monterey County police department is still actively investigating the case, seeking out witnesses and information. The basic facts of the case—including how many pieces of art were stolen, the valuation of each piece, insurance information, and whether the art in question actually exists—have not been answered, Richards said.The department is seeking out potential motives Kennaugh and Amadio might have had for filing an erroneous claim. Amadio told the AP that the art stolen was only insured for $72,000.
“They are not answering questions, cooperating with detectives, or providing us with identifying information on the stolen property,” said Richards. “We just don’t know [what happened], but something is not right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Lance Armstrong won his record-breaking seventh Tour de France championship in 2005, Chris Hong was playing the violin, not giving a moment’s thought to cycling. Now, four years later in Hong’s senior year at Harvard, his stringed instruments have been pushed to the wayside for handlebars and a saddle, and cycling has become his new, and favorite, tune.
In a sport where it typically takes several years to reach a competitive level, Hong has made amazing progress since he started riding during his senior year at Gilman High School in Baltimore, Md.
As Hong’s mentor and high school teacher, Rick Norton, explains, “In cycling, unlike in other sports, you make only incremental gains each year you train. It takes a special kind of discipline to continue training once you encounter difficulties, reach a plateau in your improvement, or when the gain you make is much smaller than the amount of work you put into it.”
Anna McLoon, one of Hong’s training partners and a Harvard graduate student, continues, “I think the things that have helped Chris develop so quickly in the sport are the things that really set any athlete apart. Chris is innately good at figuring out what his goals are both long-term and short-term, what he needs to do week by week and year by year to get to there...It’s that combination of good goal setting, flexibility, and tenacity that sets Chris apart.”
Perhaps the most impressive thing about Hong’s success is that, as McLoon puts it, “his natural body-type isn’t exactly one that screams out at you ‘elite cyclist.’”
With a 5’6, 115-pound frame, the senior describes himself as “smaller than most small cyclists.” But this is a point of motivation rather than frustration for him.
“That’s the beauty of cycling,” Hong says. “People of all different body types can still do well. I found my strength and niche as a climber and am just focusing on that to hopefully become one of the best climbers in the country.”
“Chris is a smaller guy...but he really latched on to cycling as an outlet to be one of the absolute best,” Norton adds. “So he has the determination to do every kind of race and is good in every kind, despite his body type.”
This determination propelled Hong to spend the summer riding with a professional team based in Utah, Bob’s Bicycles, whose mission statement is to provide elite cyclists with a platform to pursue their cycling goals and to develop a sense of teamwork and communication.
The rigorous cycling program blended perfectly with Hong’s impeccable work ethic.
“Chris is one of those guys that you simply can’t exaggerate how hard you want him to train, because he’ll train that hard and more, to the point of being overworked,” Norton comments, laughing a little. “Sometimes Chris almost works too hard. His biggest gain will be made when he learns how to rest a little.”
But for Hong, this characteristic is one he feels he shares with many of his peers.
“I think [a strong work ethic] is pretty true with all Harvard students, and is a trait of most serious cyclists in general,” Hong says. “In both cases, you’re almost required to be a little obsessive-compulsive with studying and training. You learn that if you have to get something done in cycling or in school work, sometimes you just have to suck it up and do it.”
With an attitude like this, it’s no wonder that Hong is a success both on and off the race track. With plans to go to medical school and to continue cycling competitively, the senior has learned quickly how to manage his time.
“[Chris] isn’t one to dabble around in half a dozen clubs and groups, but has picked what is the most important to him and has attacked it with laser focus,” McLoon says. “He is flexible enough to balance the science and sport...to do sports physiology projects for credit and to complete cycling workouts.”
“Cycling has definitely made me be time efficient,” Hong agrees.
Another thing Hong has quickly learned through cycling is mental toughness.
“Like in any sport, it’s a question of bearing physical pain versus giving into it,” he explains. “It’s about running outside or lifting weights even when it’s difficult, or freezing and cold. You have to train, so you train.”
Some may say that he is too small to be a competitive cycler, or may have started training too late, but those few must not know Chris Hong.
As McLoon says, although he does not fit the cycling stereotype, “[Chris] loves riding and racing so much that he’s succeeding against the odds.”
One thing is certain: the day Hong dropped his violin and picked up a bike was a bright day for cycling indeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By CHRISTEN B. BROWN
CONTRIBUTING Writer
2,700 people have climbed Mt. Everest. 500 astronauts have traveled into space. Fewer than 50 people have sailed around the world. Alone. For 121 days. In a 60-foot sailboat.
**
Nearly 20 years ago, the trimaran Great American capsized off the Cape of Good Hope. No one knew that 20 years after his rescue, the sole skipper of the Great American would not only succeed on an equally extensive and fatiguing expedition, but would set two milestones along the way.
In March 2009, Harvard alum Rich Wilson ’78, MBA ’82 became the first American and the oldest person to ever complete the Vendee Globe sailing race, a four-month expedition in which sailors travel around the world, starting and finishing in France.
Wilson sailed 29,000 miles on the turbulent path around the Cape of Good Hope, which is legendary for its frightening storms.
Yet, the magnitude of the dangers of Wilson’s journey would escape one’s imagination until he describes the loss of his comrades.
“Two boats and two skippers were lost,” he reminisces. “One was saved by the Australian Navy off of Cape Horn.”
Of the 30 boats that started, Wilson finished ninth. But the distinguishable finish wasn’t the reason he entered into the race.
“As a school teacher, I knew how bored to tears kids would be in the classroom,” he quips.
So he founded sitesALIVE! in 1993, a foundation that documents Wilson’s expeditions to broadcast in classrooms throughout the country and around the world.
“The idea is to connect to students with adventures and expeditions,” Wilson explains. “Students in grades 5-9 don’t know how the journey will turn out, but since it’s connected to real people, they pay attention.”
SitesALIVE! has collected 75 semesters’ worth of adventures and expeditions.
Although Wilson’s documented journey in 1993 was only a pilot project, it turned out to be a sensational success. The interactive experience superseded Wilson’s targeted online audience, leading Wilson and partners to found another distribution channel.
This network reached a quarter of a million students through the Internet, which was 5% of the online market at the time, and newspaper publications ran for 11 weeks and reached 13 million readers. SitesALIVE! was the first online interactive learning experience at the time of its creation.
Accounts of his latest expedition in March were published in 50 U.S. newspapers and broadcast to schoolchildren in 15 other nations, including China, Taiwan, Australia, Italy, and Argentina.
“It’s a transforming experience for [the students] to virtually go out into the real world and experience things,” Wilson says.
And real world experience Wilson certainly has.
**
Sailor by day, math teacher, Washington defense analyst, technical consultant in Saudi Arabia, and writer for the Dukakis campaign by night?
Well, not in the literal sense. But Wilson has served in all of these roles at some point in his life.
He was a math teacher in the Boston public schools during the first year of desegregation, a Washington defense analyst on B-52s and cruise missiles, a technical consultant for power and desalination plants in Saudi Arabia, and a writer for Michael Dukakis’ presidential campaign.
He holds three long-distance world sailing records. His book, Racing a Ghost Ship, won the Scientific American Young Readers Book Award. His MIT master’s thesis on the Antarctic Krill Fishery spawned legislation in Congress to build a fisheries research vessel capable of traveling to the Antartic.
“Who would’ve thought my thesis would be used as research for a congressional bill?” Wilson laughs.
His wide array of interests have led him to not only pursue his passions but also excel in each one, and he encourages Harvard undergraduates to do the same.
“Expose yourself to as many cultures and disciplines as you can,” Wilson advises. “You have the opportunity to do whatever you want—an opportunity that others might not have. Don’t be swayed by the idea of making a lot of money or studying something simply because your parents did.”
And he understands that finding that perfect fit takes time.
“I knew my role would be in education, and I knew I would be a teacher somehow, but I wanted to reach more students,” Wilson reflects. “It just took awhile to find the niche that suited.”
Despite his achievements, Wilson continues to take on risky yet admirable feats to achieve his ultimate goal—to show kids that there are no limits in life.
“I’ve had asthma since age one, and as a kid, it would’ve been nice to see someone doing something—anything—with asthma,” Wilson says.
And although completing the Vendee Globe was a major success, Wilson admits to having reservations in the beginning.
“The Vendee Globe was too long, too hard, too dangerous,” he says, joking that “I would’ve rather go played in a Superbowl with the Patriots just to take a day off.”
But inspiring kids of all ages to persevere in the face of difficulty gave him the motivation to push through to the end.
Lorraine Leo, a teacher at the Jackson School in Newton, Mass., has used sitesAlive! with her students since 2001. In that time, she has witnessed first-hand the level of inspiration Wilson creates for her students.
“The younger girls thought it was nice to see him competing against women from other nations,” she explains. “They really liked that.”
Leo used Wilson’s journeys to teach her students from a “global perspective.” Still, she hoped her students would take from the voyages something more than the experience of simply watching a sporting event.
“I always emphasized his perseverance,” she says, “to show that despite his severe asthma, his circumstances, and regardless of whether or not he won or lost, he would always keep trying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With fierce crossfield winds and soggy turf, there was no place for much finesse yesterday at Ohiri Field. That was fine with the No. 8 Harvard men’s soccer team (8-1, 1-0 Ivy) as it grinded to a 2-0 victory over Patriot League opponent Holy Cross (3-7, 1-1 Patriot).
“It was good to get that result,” Crimson coach Jamie Clark said. “The wind played a big factor. It wasn’t the prettiest game we’ve had, but we got two scores and didn’t give up any chances.”
Freshman goalkeeper Brett Conrad—in his first collegiate start—and the Crimson defense certainly didn’t give the Crusaders many chances to make a play, allowing only four shots on goal in the shutout effort.
This was nothing new to the Harvard defense: it’s allowed just three goals through the first nine games of the season.
But it was sophomore Ben Tsuda and co-captain Andre Akpan who managed to put the Crimson on the scoreboard in the first half.
Tsuda struck first, taking a pass from freshman Scott Prozeller on the left side and speeding just far enough past a Holy Cross defender to squeeze a bouncing shot into the back of the net.
Ten minutes later, sophomore defender Tim Lyndon, meeting a pass from freshman Zack Wolfenson, was pulled down in the box, resulting in a penalty. Akpan lined up the ensuing kick, only to see his shot blocked away by Crusader keeper Thomas Booth.
But the rebound bounced straight back to the All-Ivy striker who chipped in his seventh goal of the season. The 2-0 lead was all the Crimson would need on a day when both teams struggled to find an offensive rhythm.
“[Wolfenson] and [Lyndon] did a good job in the box to draw the [penalty kick],” Akpan said. “I didn’t hit it too well, but luckily it came back and I could put it in.”
In an experimental role as center midfielder, junior Alex Chi seemed to be all over the field, disrupting the Holy Cross offense and creating chances for the Crimson.
“Chi’s very scrappy—he wins a lot of matchups and comes up with the ball close to the goal a lot,” Akpan said.
The setup was in part a chance to put Chi in a position to make more plays around the ball despite the push of the wind.
“I think Chi does really well in that position, he picks up the ball and can do a lot of things there,” Clark said. “We use these games as an opportunity to see what works—I don’t know if it’s a line we are going to use a lot.”
Chi’s toughness was necessary in a game defined by a gritty tempo. Fouls and injuries piled up throughout the match, and both Tsuda and sophomore Baba Omosegbon were helped off the field in the first half.
Neither player returned to action, yet Clark dispelled any serious concerns after the game.
“Everyone took a few knocks, but I don’t think any of them are serious enough to keep us out,” Clark said.
But the Crimson players were less than thrilled with some fouls committed by the Crusaders.
The referees took notice 15 minutes into the second half, when they sent off Holy Cross defender James Imbriani for a second yellow card.
“It was kind of a chippy game,” Akpan said. “[Holy Cross] was getting in late on a few tackles and a couple guys had to come off with some injuries, but hopefully they will be back for this weekend.”
Harvard resumes Ivy League play Saturday at Cornell, hoping to remain unbeaten in the Ancient Eight.
As for yesterday’s non-conference victory?
“It was one of those tough mid-week games,” Akpan said. “But it’s just a game you have to win, and we were able to do that.”

Today, you get a chance to check out the Eliot, Kirkland, and Winthrop House gyms in the second in our four part series. These "gyms," generally limited to House residents, range from dingy dungeons with a few exercise machines, to dingy dilapidated rooms with a television set and a few more exercise machines. But yeah, maybe they're not that bad. Some are definitely better than others. And if your gym sucks, there is always the MAC or the QRAC. Most gyms are card swipe access for their house only, but hey, you can always make friends and borrow a resident's ID.
As before each gym will receive between one and five stars.
Eliot House Gym (***)
This particularly spacious gym with a musty smell sits under D entryway. While most House gyms are pretty cramped, Eliot managed to avoid that issue. In part, this is because Eliot only has two treadmills, two elliptical machines/cross-trainers, one stair machine, and one bike. (There are also ergs in a nearby room.) In all, there's less cardio equipment here than in Winthrop and Kirkland.
Eliot, as most Houses, has basic weightlifting equipment. It also has a few perks, like a CD/Tape player, a punching bag, and a good supply of exercise mats. They also have amusing posters on the wall of House Master Lino Pertile: "Lino is not as strong as you, put your weights back." Classy.
Kirkland and Winthrop, after the jump.
Kirkland House Gym (***)
Anyone with swipe access can get into the Kirkland House gym, under E Entry. The gym sits in a larger room. As you exercise you can listen to the sound of an adjacent ping pong game. This seems to take away from the gym atmosphere but also means the space is more open and thus less crowded feeling.
Kirkland has three elliptical machines/cross-trainers, two bikes, two ergs, two stair machine, and one treadmill. It also has a punching bag, a fan, and a television. It even has chalk for lifting weights.

Winthrop House Gym (****)
This is unequivocally the best of the three. Under J Entry, you can find four ergs, some exercise equipment, and a punching bag sitting next to a laundry room. But that's not all. Swipe your Winthrop ID and you can get into another room which holds the bulk of the gym's equipment. There are three treadmills, one bike, one elliptical/cross-trainer, and one stair machine.
While this second room is definitely a bit cramped, it is well stocked. It holds a wide range of weights, has a television set, and a large fan. Overall Winthrop offers a complete workout in a clean looking space. While the separation in Adams House into two equally unattractive rooms was a downside, in Winthrop this setup allows the House to provide a variety of equipment without piling things on top of each other.

If there's one thing FlyBy has discovered during our college experience, it's this: there's no food like cheap food.
And it turns out our very own Greenhouse Café's joining the bandwagon of affordable eats. In addition to their month-long specials, today they'll be serving up cheese pizza for a dollar per slice, according to HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin.
If nothing else, it's better than lunch in the d-halls tomorrow: tofu panaeng curry. Seriously.

The Crimson reported today that Bombay Club is closing their Harvard Square location on Oct. 25 and moving to the South End in early November, due to declining sales, high rent costs, and a financial dispute with landlord Raj Dhanda.
Though professors and students admitted they don't eat out a great deal, several said they will miss Bombay Club—including Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz, a Bombay Club regular.
Read more from Dershowitz and others after the jump.
"I'm going to miss the Bombay Club—particularly the tandoori chicken," he told The Crimson yesterday. "I'll probably go to the South End and try it a few times, see how it is down there."
Dershowitz added that he enjoyed going there with first-year law students to introduce them to Indian food for the first time and with colleagues like Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr. and African-American Studies Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates Jr.
According to Bombay Club owner Vinod Kapoor, Bombay Club is Gates' "favorite restaurant" and the professor goes there "two or three times a week when he is in town." Gates, who is not in town at present, could not be reached for comment.
"Bombay Club sort of became the Faculty Club," said Religion Professor Diana Eck of the time when the Faculty Club on Quincy St. was closed for renovations a few years ago.  "It was inexpensive and collegial, and you didn't have to wait very long because of the buffet."

Every city needs an errant politician, and it looks like Cambridge has at least one.
State Senator and Cambridge Rindge and Latin strength-and-conditioning coach Anthony Gallucio was caught by witnesses when he sped off after hitting a family of four's minivan with his car. The incident occurred on the corner of Linnean and Garden St. in Harvard Square at around 5:30 p.m. on Sunday.
Galluccio has apologized for fleeing the scene, citing "poor judgement," and "panic."  The State Senator has been convicted of drunk driving twice before and would not say whether Sunday's incident occurred as a result of drinking.
Needless to say, this little brouhaha may serve solidify Cambridge's solid image as being a hot spot for big-names-who-have-run-ins with the law. But somehow, we doubt Galluccio and the family of four will sort out their differences over a pint any time soon...

House intramural fanatics may have noticed that over the past month Mather has been conspicuously absent from the competition list. Well, you weren't mistaken.
After Mather's IM teams missed a number of games this season, chaos erupted over the ever entertaining Mather-open list last week.
"It pains me greatly to see Mather IMs go under," one undergrad wrote. "I noticed the emails about still not having reps?...I'm still hoping a couple people will step up and organize teams..."
What's this about not having an IM rep? Not so fast! FlyBy has the real answer after the jump.
According to Jason B. Kleban '11—who became the IM rep only this week—a non-resident tutor in the house was officially listed as the IM rep for the beginning of the year. That tutor, who could not be reached for comment, was responsible for compiling lists of team members and sending reminder emails about games to the house.
It is still unclear why a tutor and not an undergraduate student was appointed as Mather's IM rep (as is the practice in most other houses).
Matherites were, for the most part, under the impression that Mather simply did not have an IM rep. The result: just a little bit of panic... just a little.
After several of these "frantic emails," Kleban says, "At one point I sort of got dragged into it, and I posted all of the future games for the rest of the season, so hopefully we won’t have any more forfeits the rest of this season."
Not to worry, Mather, you've still got two seasons to catch up on points.

The kids are “sleepwalking” through their rehearsals, even though sectionals are just a few bars away. What’s gotten into the team, and how will Mr. Schue get them back in the zone? Meanwhile, Sue plots to destroy Will by stirring up the Will-Terri-Emma-Ken love rectangle… (spoilers after the jump).
Turns out that New Directions is in an easy-sounding bracket for sectionals – the team only has to beat the Dayton School for the Deaf and Jane Adams Academy, a “halfway house for girls just getting out of juvie,” to make it to regionals. (This is the show’s second unkind potshot at deaf teens, although if this is the same fictional school that humiliated McKinley High’s football team, then maybe our heroes shouldn’t celebrate just yet.) Emma and Will decide to hold a guys vs. girls contest to keep the kids motivated, with the winning team choosing the club’s opening number. Finn’s overextended, though, and Quinn’s low on energy what with being preggers and all. Luckily, though, Sue plants marital suspicions in Terri’s mind and convinces her to become the school nurse to spy on Will and Emma, so now the kids have an unlicensed practitioner to help out. It’s okay, though – “it’s a public school.” Her solution for the entire club: Vitamin D! Pseudoephedrine. Suddenly the kids are on top of school and enthusiastic about their extracurriculars. Finn even wants to build a house with Habitat for Humanity. Omg, hooray: it’s like Harvard!
Meanwhile, Quinn is increasingly ostracized for her pregnancy, and Rachel reaches out to her, despite, um, Quinn’s history of drawing porn of Rachel in the bathroom (wtfuck?). Terri decides to neutralize Emma by goading Ken into proposing to the “doe-eyed little harlot.” Emma calls Terri out on her monstrosity (“He deserves a lot better than you.”) and Mrs. Schue fires back (“You’re so innocent that you would steal a man away from his pregnant wife.”) in a verbal catfight that might best last week’s. Terri continues her rampage, finally getting Quinn to agree to giving up her baby but quashing the cheerleader’s extortion attempt. Ken proposes, and it’s a genuinely sweet moment. We’d feel sorry for him … except that Emma says yes.
Eventually, the kids do the right thing, and both teams withdraw from the intraclub competition and confess to their drug usage. Unfortunately, poor Howard, Terri’s stooge and supplier, gets arrested on crystal meth suspicions, and Principal Figgins loses faith in Will and Terri, firing Terri and assigning Sue as glee's new co-chair. Delicious.
Musical Numbers
Mashup: “It’s My Life” by Bon Jovi and “Confessions Part II” by Usher
Well, now we know why Finn seemed so bubbly in the previews. Despite the excess enthusiasm, the number works. The mashup is clever, and the songs resonate with Finn’s need to reclaim control of his life. One of FlyBy’s ongoing concerns is Cory Monteith’s limited vocal range, but he sounds great here. We hope more of his future parts focus on vocal power rather than acrobatics. It’s nice to hear Artie featured again, too, and the energetic choreography makes the smoothest incorporation of the wheelchair we’ve seen so far. All around, a good number.
B+
Mashup: “Halo” by Beyoncé and “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves.
Rachel comes off a little too fierce rather than sunshine-y, and the songs don’t mesh quite as well as in the other mashup, but FlyBy loves the fun sundresses and the bounciness of it. The number skirts the line of being too cute, though. A little more and it could be a Target commercial. And what was up with that last note?
B …but as Rachel points out, maybe my gender makes me biased.
Missing Plotlines
Sue’s Corner
We’re v. happy we got more than a full dose of Sue this week, as we learned that she likes kicking children off her team at random, beef bone smoothies, and hovercrafts. We’re also enjoying the running joke about Will’s alleged perm, although we were shocked at Sue's violence toward a senior citizen. Also, we’re tickled that Sue was born in the Panama Canal Zone and still ran for office twice. Admirable.
Best line of the week: Sue’s description of Emma as “a real floozy and a man eater,” a “mentally-ill ginger pygmy with eyes like a bush baby.”
The Short Version
We realize that the episodes are always about different characters, so we were due for a story focusing on the adults, but they’re just not as fun as the kids. And as usual, way too much happens in one episode, but at least this week it felt like the characters had a little room to breathe. Rachel, Quinn, and Ken all got fleshed out more sympathetically.
Overall: B. Not every episode can be a showstopper, but if Glee settles into having episodes like this one as its baseline (instead of episodes like “Acafellas”), we are so on board.
