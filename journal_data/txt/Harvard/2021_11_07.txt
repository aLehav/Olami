After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students returned to campus this fall, they were met with a changed landscape. Local staples such as Cafe Pamplona and Blue Bottle Coffee had left, whereas new businesses such as Lovepop — what even is Lovepop? — have sprung up in the Square. On Holyoke Street, a bright neon sign standing out in contrast with the dull brick background reads “Smoke Shop.” No, this is not a vape or hookah shop, as one might think; it is Cambridge’s newest barbecue joint. Chef Andy Husbands opened the restaurant on Halloween Day 2020 as the fourth location of his local chain. Approaching the one-year anniversary of the Harvard Square location, it was time to give “The Smoke Shop” a try.
Approaching the restaurant on Holyoke Street, the massive, open windows immediately create a welcoming environment for the customer. Even while outside, it feels as if you are already a part of the atmosphere. On the inside, the chic bar — complete with over 250 whiskey and bourbon options — is juxtaposed with the TVs and family-friendly environment. This is a place where one could get dinner with the family or grab a drink with friends.
However, it is not the ambiance which determines the restaurant’s true worth. It’s the food.
The “Pit Boss,” which includes your choice of three meats and three sides, is a clear highlight of the menu. The beef brisket was so incredibly tender that it could be cut with a butter knife. Likewise, the pulled pork and chicken themselves were completely juicy and flavorful. With the sauces, however, the flavor profile of the meal was at a whole different level. For those with a classic taste, the “Sweet Victory” barbeque sauce is the perfect combination with the pork. For those with a love of spice, the “Hot Streak” nicely complements the pulled chicken.
The true hidden gem is the assortment of sides. Specifically, the pimento mac & cheese is heaven in every bite. Covered in breadcrumbs, the cheesy, crunchy, spicy conglomeration makes for a gastronomical delight. Additionally, the warm corn bread — covered in honey — almost makes for more of a dessert than a side.
The one downside of the dining experience is the portion sizes. For the price, the amount of food received is less than expected. Compare this to restaurants in the South or Midwest United States, where you can get a plate of barbecue for the price of a round-trip T pass. Such is the nature of operating a business in Harvard Square; rent ain’t cheap. However, part of the appeal of barbecue as a “soul food” is that it’s cheap, messy, and for the people. Spending large amounts of money feels a bit paradoxical.
Regardless, “The Smoke Shop” is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise barbecue-less Cambridge. The pulled pork, mac & cheese, and whiskey selections are three must-try items for your next visit.
“The Smoke Shop” has five locations, all in the greater Boston area: Assembly Row, Seaport, Kendall Square, Harvard Square, and Hub Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Theatergoers with modern sensibilities might be unaccustomed to the boisterous displays of a century-old burlesque show — especially when that show calls for the release of a flock of trained bats into the theater. Burlesque troupe Boston BeauTease’s contemporary production of the infamous “Vamps After Midnite!”, which ran at the Boston Center for the Arts from Oct. 21 through Oct. 30, spares viewers from that zoological nightmare. However, the show still remains admirably committed to the burlesque genre, even when that means trying too hard to engage with the audience. “Vamps After Midnite!” artfully weaves together parody with impressive individual performance, ultimately distinguishing itself by embracing the humor in burlesque’s sheer outrageousness.
The story behind “Vamps After Midnite!” is a curious one: In 1912, an impresario spent a hefty sum of money on novel special effects, a large orchestra, and live animals to adapt a German opera, which was itself inspired by a 19th-century novel written by Lord Byron’s physician. The result was a burlesque show long-fabled but rarely seen by audiences. As explained in promotional material for the modern production, its predecessor closed after only three performances and wasn’t revived until the Boston BeauTease allegedly received the only surviving libretto from an anonymous donor. Absurdity and mystery underscore the show’s existence.
The present-day performance tackles the original plot, which follows the conflict between a professor in vampirology (accompanied by a team of nuns) and an ancient Egyptian vampire. In a meta twist, performers occasionally address the audience to discuss how the show has been updated. The actors intermittently quibble with antiquated dialogue and deal with scripted mishaps by the stage manager as the professor chases the vampire through Victorian-era London to her lair back in Egypt.
The self-referential nature of the production, while opening the door for a series of amusing gags, initially comes off as trite. The show opens with the stage manager painting the set, only to panic when the director explains that the audience has already arrived. The theater itself is largely barren, as a projector screen constitutes the only real addition to the environment. Permitting the audience to observe backstage events, which are themselves staged, feels like a form of overcompensation from the outset — an immediate yet artificial apology for the meager scenery. Humor revolving around the performance itself, when employed in excess, is both tired and disingenuous, distracting from the substance of the show.
“Vamps After Midnite!” mitigates these risks, however, with true-to-form burlesque choreography that demonstrates remarkable individual talent. Throughout the two-hour performance, dancers don elaborate costumes only to shed them in detailed routines which often involve props and interactions with other characters. In one scene, the ancient vampire tours her new home in London before her realtor, infatuated with the vampire’s prowess, initiates a sensuous partner dance; sequined and feathered Victorian-era dresses give way to corsets and tassels.
Perhaps it is simply the shock of witnessing burlesque — a decidedly old-school and relatively racy form of entertainment — in the 21st century that makes up for the show’s kitsch humor, as opposed to the actual quality of the performance. Yet audiences must commend each dancer’s commitment to entertain, unafraid of the vulnerability such risqué routines demand.
Moments of crude humor and deft choreography trade the spotlight, but the highlights of the show happen when the two are skillfully wed. In one scene, a Mother Superior reminisces about her youth in Paris by performing a striptease while images of the city flash in a slideshow on the projector screen behind her. In the middle of her routine, however, the screen displays a request for more pictures before awkward personal images of the stage manager appear, followed by a note from the stage manager apologizing for misunderstanding that the director wanted more photos of Paris. The incongruity between the show’s deliberate shortcomings and the actress’s talent both honors the boundary-pushing essence of the burlesque genre while brilliantly satirizing it with a 21st-century punchline.
Consistent with the mystery surrounding the show’s origins, little information about the actors or all others involved has been made available to audiences. The production also did not respond to emails requesting additional details about the team. After Halloween, “Vamps After Midnite!” will likely fade into obscurity once more, as the burlesque style continues to clash with modern expectations. Yet this rendition adds a distinct and commendable chapter to the show’s enigmatic history, transcending the cheap showiness of its first impression. Such a performance requires remarkable creativity and courage, and the fact that the Boston BeauTease tackles this bizarre original text at all makes for a show that is unique among both typical contemporary theater and the past burlesque productions it emulates — and thus worth our patronage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On one of the last Friday nights before midterms are in full swing, the last place you’d expect to find Harvard students is in the admissions office. But tucked into a portion of the building is the Agassiz Theater, where the Asian Student Arts Project rehearses everyday for their Pan-Asian production of “Legally Blonde,” which opened on Oct. 28.
ASAP is an organization for Asian students at Harvard who want to celebrate their artistic passions in conjunction with their identities. “We are constantly creating open spaces where pan-Asian students can feel like they have a space to express themselves and have their art lifted,” director and ASAP co-president Karina L. Cowperthwaite ’23 said.
The club’s culture is rooted in its theater presence, although ASAP honors arts of all forms. Ian Chan ’22–’23, one of the music directors of the production and a senior member of ASAP, has seen its members enthusiastically rally around the fall show. “People are really excited about being a part of our Asian arts community as a result of having been in ‘Legally Blonde,’” Chan said, “and conversely people a part of ASAP are excited about ‘Legally Blonde’ from being a part of our community.”
This semester’s musical, however, was unlike any other ASAP production put on in the past. All of ASAP’s past shows were written with Asian identities in mind, Cowperthwaite said. “Legally Blonde” is perhaps as far as you can get from that trend. Very few contemporary Broadway musicals highlight Asian American stories. “That's really hard when you're a theater group,” Cowperthwaite said. “Especially coming back from COVID, we really wanted to start off with a big production.”
But faced with this challenge, Cowperthwaite came up with the idea to put on a traditionally white musical in an all-Asian space. “I think what's been really exciting about that is seeing what that text looks like when it's with people who it wasn't necessarily written for,” she said.
Tia A. KwanBock ’25, who played Vivian Kensington in the production, agreed, and said she actually appreciated being able to explore other themes in addition to her identity. “I’m excited for the audience to see a show with an entirely pan-Asian cast where the plot is not entirely about being Asian,” she said.
With “Legally Blonde” in particular, the irony in this casting is quite powerful. Its plot is about a privileged white girl, who gets herself into Harvard at the drop of a dime in a quest for love. While Elle’s race is not specified, whiteness is deeply rooted in most people’s perceptions of the character --originally casted by Reese Witherspoon and later Laura Bell Bundy. So, a lot goes into racially coding this to fit a minority cast. “There are narratives and a history between Asian Americans and the Harvard admissions officers, like the lawsuit,” Cowperthwaite said, referring to Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard College, “so all of a sudden, this narrative becomes a little bit politicized.”
But what does it actually mean to turn that narrative into a Pan-Asian story? “It means that this Legally Blonde will be nothing like any other,” Cowperthwaite said, laughing. For one thing, she has been working with the production’s designers to incorporate signifiers of Asian identity into the characters they are creating. There are a lot of different details to consider and play with: “What kind of TV shows does she watch? What kind of music does she listen to? What kind of bougie sushi places do they go to?”
The cast was excited about the work, and excited to be putting on a show of this scale in such an Asian-inclusive space. Julia H. Riew ’21–’22, who plays Brooke and is one of ASAP’s founders, said she finds the project energizing. “It's exciting to know that parts of my identity don't have to be hidden in order to play this role,” Riew said. “In fact, they can actually be brought out.”
With just a few weeks between auditions and performances, the rehearsal process had to move quickly. “It’s been 15 days since we’ve had a first rehearsal and we’ve learned 80% of the music, so we are really speeding through here,” Chan said. “We really were blessed to see an incredible pool of auditionees, with absolutely incredible talent —and not just that, but incredible Asian talent.”
The cast’s commitment to their roles was clear, especially as their singing fills the halls late into night. Riew, playing Brooke in the notorious singing while jump-roping scene, admitted that she’s been jumping every single day to build up stamina. “And to do it with a mask,” she said. “It's gonna be really interesting.” But with this being her last year with ASAP, she is excited about how far her organization has come, and thrilled with its take on “Legally Blonde.” “It tells a really great story about a woman who goes to a place that she never would have seen herself before, and learns something about herself that she never thought she could,” Riew said. “I think that is something that not just people in ASAP but so many just people at Harvard have experienced.”

“Let’s put on a show!” director Abraham Joyner-Meyers ’21 shouts enthusiastically, ushering in the cast and crew. The dance rehearsal space at the American Repertory Theater is filled with a certain kind of tension. Nervous chatter fills the room and then silence. “Places!” Joyner-Meyers shouts — and so it begins: The first run-through rehearsal for this year’s production of “The Winter’s Tale.”
On Oct. 28 at the Loeb Ex, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company premiered its magical rendition of Shakespeare’s classic play. After a long time away from in-person theater, this is one of the very first productions at Harvard devoid of laptop screens, virtual backdrops, and — most importantly — Zoom.
“The Winter’s Tale,” first published in 1623, is one of Shakespeare’s more ambiguously classified plays, intertwining drama with much-needed comic relief. King Leontes, blinded by jealousy and passion, sends his wife to jail and banishes her newborn child from his country. A fruitful premise for tragic losses, mischievous games of pretend, and maybe even a happy ending.
“The goal is to do Shakespeare for the present moment, for right now,” Joyner-Meyers says. Nevertheless, The Winter’s Tale has been around for quite some time and proving the relevance of a play which has already been performed countless times is always a challenge. However, Hyperion’s production seems ready to tackle it, armed with innovative stage design and effects which aim to render this production nothing short of magical.
“Our original image for the show was taking the magic of the show and making it magical to the audience,” Joeyner-Meyers says. Hyperion has partnered with the Society of Harvard Undergraduate Magicians to bring this vision to life. Audience members can look forward to the defiance of gravity and the sudden disappearance of characters: Stage magic meets street magic.
“I love the literal take on magic that we are doing,” producer Sage Barnes ’25 says, “things that were impossible during the time that it was written but make the story come to life in a way that I hope Shakespeare would really enjoy.”
The cast and crew want to lean into the ambiguity of the play, convincing the audience that anything is possible in the theater. However, the reasons that drew cast and crew to the play initially are rooted in deeper emotional themes.
"It is about separation and finding each other again,” Joyner-Meyers says. “It is about reconnection. I think after all of us have been apart from each other for 16 months, coming back together, coming into a theater to tell stories — that moment has just become so meaningful, and so specific to what we are doing right now.”
“I think there is a very introspective message that people will take away from having seen this play: the fact that you have to look inside of yourself and point out what you did wrong,” Felipe Albors ’25 says.
Albors, who plays Leontes, hopes to show audiences that it is possible to atone for your sins and transform into a better person, perhaps the greatest magic trick of all.
The cast and crew have grown together over the past weeks. "Everyone is excited to come to rehearsals,” Albors says. “They want to be here, and more than that, we are all a bunch of people that have really creative ideas.”
Those creative ideas certainly come in handy when working on a play in which a guy gets eaten by a bear.
"It's a play from the very end of Shakespeare's career where he is just writing crazy shit,” Joyner-Meyers says, “crazy theatre that broke the norms even of what he was doing then, and certainly still feels new and modern.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are few leading ladies in theater as iconic as Lady Macbeth. She is one of the genre’s most captivating, difficult leads — a woman so enthralled by the pursuit of power that she drives her husband to murder and herself to madness. The American Repertory Theater is the most recent company to present their take on the character; their new production, “Macbeth in Stride,” is an 80-minute musical experience framed as a rock concert that adapts Shakespeare’s tragedy to explore Black female ambition and voice. The title “Macbeth in Stride” refers to Macbeth being “in stride” with Lady Macbeth and a counterpart in her story, and the show is the first in a five-part series re-imagining the women of Shakespeare’s canon beyond their romances and often tragic endings.
Whitney White, the creator and star of the show, is utterly captivating in her role as “Woman,” a reimagined Lady Macbeth archetype. The program covers a range of genres inspired by rock, pop, and gospel, yet White’s voice fits perfectly with each song. Her performance is emotional and riveting — it is impossible to look away. Charlie Thurston provides a strong counterpart as “Man,” a version of Macbeth. Amidst the original music, which makes up the bulk of the show, White and Thurston prove they are more than capable of delivering the source text’s famous scenes and speeches with all the tension and gravitas of a great Shakespearean production.
While these two characters were the stars of the original play, this production relies on a talented ensemble with the three witches — played by Phoenix Best, Kira Sarai Helper, and Reggie D. White — tying the piece together and pushing the narrative forward. From the first moment the witches harmonize in the opening number, “If Knowledge Is Power,” they fill the Loeb Drama Center with life and energy, pulling the audience along for the ride.
The dynamic show flows between musical theater and concert modes, just as it flows in and out of the text of the tragedy. One moment the audience sees Lady Macbeth and her husband reeling in the aftermath of their decisions to murder the king, and the next moment, the witches and the musicians in the band discuss how the pair has gone off the rails. Such instances of breaking the fourth wall help make the show more accessible; audiences familiar with the text can appreciate the twists, but those without prior knowledge can also follow along and grasp the fundamental themes and emotions at play.
The premise of excavating Lady Macbeth’s story and redeeming her — not as a conniving woman who manipulates her husband into committing murder, but rather an ambitious woman of color constrained by the prevailing narrative and punished for her desire — is fascinating and wrought with potential. The dialogue is explicit about its goals: White’s character directly states her intentions of attaining not just power but also a voice from the start, and the witches tell her a woman cannot have both ambition and love. The show repeatedly goes meta, with the witches asking how Woman intends to rework a 400 year-old play for the sake of her ego and telling her that she cannot just pick and choose the parts of the story that she likes.
As interesting as this relationship between performer, character, and audience may be, there are also moments in which the rules and roles get confusing. If Woman is conscious of the fact that she is engaging in performance and seeking to reclaim it, why is she unable to change the narrative? If her goal is to tell her story, why is she trapped within the constraints of Shakespeare’s tale — one which insists upon her reliance on a man to attain power and drives her to madness? Or, if Woman knows that the story has a tragic ending from the start, why is this the story that she chooses to obtain power? These questions do not necessarily impede a viewer’s enjoyment of the show, but they confuse the argument the show is trying to make. White makes a compelling critique of the limiting lenses through which we view women of color and their ambitions, but the show's depiction of Woman’s attempt to break out of those limitations is hardly hopeful. That said, the power of an adaptation centering and valorizing Lady Macbeth created by and starring a Black woman is notable in and of itself. "Macbeth in Stride" has successfully reimagined its iconic female lead — a figure long used to insult ambitious women — as an empowering character relatable to marginalized audiences. That enough is reason enough to support it in its run until Nov. 14. Plus, it certainly does not hurt that the visual and auditory execution make it a rollicking good time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK — Coming off two consecutive losses, to Princeton on Oct. 23 and Dartmouth on Oct. 30, Harvard (5-2, 2-2 Ivy) traveled down to New York City knowing it needed to beat Columbia (5-2, 2-2 Ivy) to have any chance of roaring back into the Ivy League title race. It got off to a hot start, with two touchdowns from junior running back Aaron Shampklin propelling the Crimson to a 14-0 lead after the first frame, and cruised to a 49-21 win to quash all of the Lions’ hopes for a conference championship. At 6-2 (3-2 Ivy), Harvard is now just one game back of Princeton, Dartmouth, and Yale (who defeated Brown, 63-38, on Saturday to improve to 4-1) in the Ancient Eight.
After sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean, who entered the season as the starter, suffered a season-ending injury, the Crimson turned to junior quarterback Luke Emge, who earned his first career start against Columbia. Emge had performed admirably in relief of senior quarterback Jake Smith in the loss to the Big Green, completing six of his eight passes for 73 yards and leading Harvard on three potential game-tying field-goal drives in the fourth quarter. After saying that, after the Dartmouth contest, he would evaluate all of his signal-caller options, head coach Tim Murphy made the move to Emge. In the victory, Emge torched the Lions for 227 yards and three touchdowns. He was also efficient, completing 17 of his 25 passes, good for a completion percentage of 68 percent, the best mark for a Crimson quarterback this season. His sole interception, an underthrown ball around the left hash marks that Columbia safety Jordan Colbert snagged at the Lions’ 40-yard line, came with the final result all but secure at 42-14.
“I was excited to get out there [and] play with the guys,” Emge said. “[I] had confidence in my game plan, confidence in the [offensive line] and receivers. We have a lot of playmakers, so my focus was just getting the ball to them and letting them make plays.”
Aided by the coaching staff, Harvard’s bevy of playmakers did just that. Shampklin was dialed from the start of the game, taking his three carries for 21 yards on the opening drive, including a five-yard score. Overall, Shampklin gained 75 yards on his 19 handoffs and found paydirt twice. Offensive coordinator Mickey Fein also presented an aggressive passing offense early, which reflected a clear contrast from its previous games, when Dean and Smith predominantly threw short and medium-range passes. However, on the first possession, Emge tossed a long pass down the right sideline that junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly high-pointed in traffic. Throughout the afternoon, Emge repeatedly attempted to throw into the heart of Columbia’s secondary.
The Crimson also tried to catch the Lions' defense off guard with trick plays. It completed two of them in the first half, each going for significant gains that set up touchdowns on each of the ensuing snaps. In the opening quarter, Harvard used the fear of a Shampklin run to set up a wide-open completion to senior wide receiver James Batch. Shampklin took the handoff up the middle before pitching it back to Emge, who launched it downfield. Although he slightly underthrew Batch, no blue jerseys were within five yards of the receiver. He took it down the sideline before he was finally pushed out of bounds just shy of the pylon. Shampklin plunged up the middle for a score on the next play to extend the Crimson lead to 14-0. It was his tenth touchdown of the season: in addition to his nine on the ground, he also took a short pass into the end zone against Dartmouth on Oct. 30.
“I thought our coaches did a great job of game-planning,” Murphy explained. “Having a balanced offense, having a complementary offense, keeping teams guessing, going with some big plays to get some momentum, … the combination of those things today led to a big output.”
A few drives later, the Harvard offense did it again. After receiving the ball on its own 46-yard line after notching a fourth-down stop with a 21-0 lead, Emge manufactured a score in just 34 seconds. The possession started off with another trick play, this time a reverse to sophomore wide receiver Gavin Sharkey, who launched a tight spiral into tight coverage up the right hash marks to Batch. Showing off his natural touch, Sharkey placed it where only his receiver could get it, just over the outstretched hands of the Lions defender. The very next play, Emge lasered a perfectly-placed pass on a shallow post route to junior tight end Adam Shepherd, who came down in the end zone for another touchdown.
“I didn’t make the call. That was [Fein] who did a great job with it, but I did put down an edict that we’re going to run [a certain] amount of explosives,” Murphy said. “We’ve built up a resume, that they haven’t seen those things, and therefore, it’s obviously the perfect time to get after it.”
Meanwhile, while everything broke the Crimson’s way in the early going, Columbia’s missed opportunity on its second drive cost it all the momentum it had gathered by driving down to Harvard’s five-yard line. Defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99’s unit had been the fifth-best red-zone defense in the nation, allowing points on just 63.2 percent of its opponents’ drives into the red zone. The Crimson defense held its ground, and after Lions kicker Alex Felkins missed a 23-yard field goal attempt, Columbia never seriously threatened to score again until late in the third quarter.
“[It was] really hard. I think [there were] a couple throws I could have hit there,” Lions quarterback Joe Green said. “It’s kind of tough, but [we] definitely should have come away with seven [points] there.”
Throughout the game, Crimson receivers made tough catch after tough catch. On Harvard's third touchdown, Emge lofted a high ball towards the back right corner of the end zone, trusting his 6’7” target, senior wide receiver/long snapper Adam West, to come down with it. He did exactly that, giving Harvard a three-score lead. Then, on its last possession of the half, the Crimson had a chance to go into the break with a five-score lead. Thanks to some heroics by Emge and Wimberly, it executed a flawless touchdown drive to all but put the game away early.
Columbia looked as if it might avoid conceding a score when it seemed to have Emge trapped in the backfield on a 2nd and 10 near midfield. However, the quarterback ducked to his left, evaded a few would-be tacklers, and broke a few more tackles before finding an opening up the middle for 14 yards, his longest rush of the game. A few plays later, Shampklin bounced around the right tackle to gain a first down on 3rd and 2, and the referees tacked on another ten yards after calling Lions defensive end Mitch Moyer for a personal conduct penalty. Emge made Columbia pay for its mistake, firing a strike to Wimberly’s back shoulder, which he hauled in in tight coverage.
“It was just a good job by our guys, Luke especially, just putting the ball in good spots,” said Wimberly, who led the team with 109 receiving yards, the first triple-digit performance by a Harvard receiver this season. “That is something we work on all day at practice, making those contested catches, and it was just a show today that we can do that.”
Despite its second-largest halftime lead of the season, Murphy refused to let off the gas after the break. After Columbia was forced to punt without earning a first down on its opening possession of the half, Harvard made an aggressive play call at the Lions’ 32-yard line. Facing 4th and 6 and well within junior kicker Jonah Lipel’s range, Emge trotted back out onto the field to attempt the conversion. Columbia entered the game with the nation’s ninth-stingiest fourth-down defense, conceding a fresh set of downs on 27.3 percent of its opponents’ attempts this season. However, Fein designed a quick curl for Wimberly down the left sideline, which kept the drive alive. The next play, sophomore running back Aidan Borguet bounced around the left side and scampered past the pylon, extending the Crimson lead to 42 points.
“We talked about it at halftime. Offense, defense, special teams, we were going to keep the pedal down,” Murphy said. “We had a different type of lead than you expect to have in our league, but we were not taking anything for granted.”
The hosts finally got on the board towards the end of the third quarter, sparked by their two-time Ivy League First-Team return specialist, wide receiver Mike Roussos. After Lions defensive lineman Ben Corniello brought Emge down at his own one-yard line on third down, junior punter Jon Sot’s kick made it only to Harvard’s 40-yard line, where Roussos was waiting for it. The senior found a hole down the left half of Robert K. Kraft Field, taking it all the way down to the nine-yard line before finally being caught by junior cornerback David Spitz. Two plays later, Green kept it himself from six yards out, cutting the Crimson lead to 42-7.
Columbia managed to score on two of its next three possessions as well, forcing Murphy to keep Emge in the game. Starting their drive on their own 29-yard line to begin the fourth quarter, trailing by 35 points, the Lions managed to open up their deep passing game, completing two passes of 20 yards or more in a ten-play, 71-yard drive. On second and goal at the Harvard 11, Green rolled out to his right and fired a strike to tight end Luke Painton. Then, after Colbert’s interception, Lions running back Dante Miller took the first snap 40 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown to cut the Crimson lead to three scores with 10 minutes, 24 seconds remaining in the game.
“Defensively, we saw in that fourth quarter especially, that they really started to pop some plays,” said senior linebacker Jordan Hill, who is serving as the 147th captain of Harvard football this season. “That’s something that we definitely need to work on, more internally than looking at what they were doing, but not allowing those plays to stack up against us.”
Instead of turning to Smith or one of his other quarterbacks, Murphy opted to keep Emge in the game, and he delivered a dagger. Harvard marched slowly and methodically down the field, chewing six minutes, two seconds off the clock in ten plays and traveling 75 yards to the end zone. Although he only threw the ball once, it went for an explosive play, as Wimberly evaded defenders for a 24-yard gain on 3rd and 6. It was Borguet who finally found paydirt, zooming around the right side for a ten-yard touchdown to firmly hammer the nail in Columbia’s coffin. The sophomore led the team in rushing yards, producing 98 yards and two touchdowns on his 15 carries. It was the third time this season that Borguet rushed for at least 80 yards, to go along with an 85-yard performance against Georgetown on Sept. 18 and a 169-yard masterpiece against Lafayette, a game that Shampklin missed with an injury.
Despite the comfortable victory, which improved the Crimson’s record against its conference rival to 63-15-1 (.804), Hill was not satisfied with his defense’s performance. With critical Ivy League matchups against Penn (Nov. 13) and Yale (Nov. 20) on the horizon, and with Harvard back in contention for its 18th conference championship, the captain was focused on the second half, in which the team was outscored, 21-14.
“We didn’t finish the game the right way,” he said. “[The offense] put up 49 points. There’s not much else you can ask for on their side. … You need to be able to finish, in the games that really matter. And against Penn and Yale to finish out the season, those are going to be good games. So, the fact that we won by such a margin isn’t even something that we’re talking about. It’s more the fact that we gave up three scores in the [second half]. That’s crazy. So, just getting back to work tomorrow and preparing for this game next Saturday is our main focus right now.”
The Quakers will enter Harvard Stadium next Saturday tied for sixth in the conference, with a record of 3-5 (1-4 Ivy). For the Crimson to secure a share of the Ivy League title, it will need to beat Penn and then Yale (5-3, 4-1 Ivy) the following weekend in New Haven, Conn. Princeton and Dartmouth must also each lose one of their remaining two games. The Tigers, after falling to the Big Green, 31-7, on Friday night, will face Yale on Nov. 13 and Penn on Nov. 20. Meanwhile, Dartmouth will welcome Cornell to Hanover, N.H., on Nov. 13 before traveling to face Brown on Nov. 20.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard responded well to going behind on a brisk Saturday afternoon in New York City, scoring just 38 seconds after Columbia took the lead and adding what turned out to be the game-winning goal on the stroke of halftime to squeak past the Lions, 2-1. The Crimson remained unblemished on the road and will hope that its resume is good enough to send Harvard (12-2-1, 5-2-0 Ivy League) into the NCAA Tournament when the selection committee makes its decision on Monday afternoon.
Before Saturday, the Crimson had only conceded first twice all season: in its two losses, 1-0 defeats to Brown and Princeton. When Columbia (9-6-1, 3-4-0 Ivy) scored in the 28th minute, then, Harvard fans might have expected the worst. A strong press by the Lions’ Ally Clark and Kayla Lee paid off, as Columbia won the ball off of senior Crimson defender Maria DiMartinis in a dangerous position. Lee then sent a looping left-footed cross into the box, where a scrambling Harvard defense left striker Nata Ramirez free to loop home a header and break the deadlock. It was Ramirez’s 10th goal in her impressive first season of college soccer.
But the Crimson’s heads did not drop. Harvard quickly established possession in the final third, where it set up camp for much of a first half in which it took nine shots, including six on target. A cross by sophomore midfielder Hannah Griffin was deflected into the path of first-year midfielder Hannah Bebar, who fired a shot that was clearly heading wide before it deflected off of Columbia’s unfortunate Sophia Cavaliere into the net for an own goal.
Harvard then added a second goal, this one a payoff for the Crimson’s persistent press. Junior Hollyn Torres stole the ball in the Columbia box, took a touch, and then lofted a left-footed shot from a tight angle into the roof of the net as Harvard took the lead less than a minute before halftime. It was Torres’ third consecutive start and her second straight game with a goal, and this one turned into the first game-winning goal of her career.
“It was a battle,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “We went down a goal, and we weren’t playing our best soccer early in the game, and they capitalized, so we had to respond, and we responded really quickly, which was a great sign. I don’t think we played our best in the first half, but we were ahead at halftime, and then we were able to keep the momentum up in the second half, but it certainly wasn’t an easy win. We had to work for every ounce of it.”
Columbia pushed for an equalizer in the second half, controlling more of possession and generating a decent chance in the game’s final 10 minutes, when a shot flashed wide of the far post. But for the most part, the Crimson was able to keep Ramirez and the Lions at bay. Columbia, for its part, continued to press Harvard well and stayed compact in defense, and the Crimson struggled to generate much offense throughout the game and especially in a second half in which it managed just three attempts and no clear-cut chances to add an insurance goal.
“I think at times we were forcing things,” Hamblin said. "We weren’t being patient enough in attack. As the game went on we started to be more patient and to get at them more. They’re a good team defensively and we had to really work hard today, and we probably will look back at the video and say we could have been more patient in our buildup.”
Now Harvard’s attention shifts to the NCAA Division I Women’s Soccer Committee, which will decide its fate on Monday. The recent history of at-large bids for the Ivy League has not been a good one. The last time an Ancient Eight school won an at-large bid was Dartmouth in 2005, and the Crimson this season is second in line for an at-large bid behind Princeton, so Harvard would need a repeat of 2004, when three Ivy League schools made the NCAA Tournament. Yet Hamblin pointed to the improved quality of the conference as he expressed optimism for a three-bid Ivy League.
“Although historically this hasn’t really been done, I think this year there’s a great chance for the Ivy League to have three [tournament teams],” Hamblin said. “The quality of Princeton, Brown, and Harvard has been consistently strong, and I think we’ve shown that in our out-of-conference competition. The league has changed — the Ivy League of five, six years ago is gone, and we’re now competing at a high level. I’m really hopeful that we’ll have our name called on Monday, and I think we’ve earned that opportunity.”
If the Crimson, which before the win over Columbia ranked 12th in the NCAA’s RPI, does make the NCAA Tournament, its first-round game would be next weekend at a campus site to be determined. Hamblin said that star senior forward Murphy Agnew, who has missed the entire Ivy League season due to injury, could be ready to return for an NCAA Tournament game.
