During the last song of Father John Misty's set on Sept. 23, “Date Night,” the artist (whose real name is Joshua Tillman) hop-skipped towards the audience at the Leader Bank Pavilion, microphone in hand.
“Nothing impresses me much. I've got a great attitude,” he sang, holding the last syllable for a few seconds. His hands were in fists, parallel to his shoulders, his hips moving back and forth. He was fluid then, moving around the stage, as no instrument kept him in place. It was just him and his smooth voice.
Tillman knew his voice was good. It was evident by how he filled the space between the verses with “oooooohss” and “hmmmms” that choraled. The back-up band was just that: backing. Every peep from the clarinet, every low bass line, was there to make his voice sail across any venue on his sixth month tour promoting his new album, “Chloe and the Next 20th Century.”
The purely supportive nature of Tillman’s band made sense. The lyrics of his songs are what make Joshua Tillman Father John Misty. To listen truly to Father John Misty is to laugh out loud at the obscurity of the scenarios, the wit of the details, and the embarrassing arrogance shown by the characters he creates in his lyrics. He sings openly about death and sex in a sarcastic tone to make fun of people who think they are above it all. It could be offensive to anyone with a lesser sense of humor.
“You kiss on me. But we should let this dead guy sleep,” he sang in the third song of the set, called “Hollywood Forever Cemetery,” about hooking up with a woman in a cemetery. He held an acoustic guitar standing against a red-lit background.
Despite the fact that most of his songs are in comedic tone, he didn’t smile once during the performance. For example, he sang the popular song “Ballad of the Dying Man” with a deadpan expression. “Eventually the dying man takes his final breath, but first he checks his news feed to see what he’s ‘bout to miss.”
The straight face didn't mean he was emotionless though; he closed his eyes to hold long notes, feeling every word he sang. His previously iconic shoulder-length hair was cropped, and he dressed simply. Maybe this false seriousness adds to the character. His black blazer and trousers, his buzz cut (a new look to accompany the new album), it directly contrasted with his sharp, fluid movements and his wacky lyrics.
The opening act, the mystical and dramatic Suki Waterhouse, tried her best to prepare the audience for the show they'd be getting as she thanked him near the end of her set.
“He’s Father,” she said. “He’s just Father. I can’t explain it.”
Only about a third of the full audience was there for Suki’s set. The rest truly missed out. The stage did feel almost too large for her four-person band. It would have been nice to see her in a more intimate venue, like a dark bar, vibing to her music that brings that eerie peace of impending doom (think Beach House’s “Space Song,” or Mazzy Star). But the wind at the outdoor stage blew the smoke machine mist around her head, and her hair around her face, like she was in a beautiful music video.
Misty’s performance evoked a similar feeling, especially during the song “Pure Comedy.” Finally, the music started to get louder, and Tillman’s voice built to a scream. The single trumpet player sounded like 20.
Tillman flew across the stage with his dancing half-steps, and leaned forward into the microphone, curling in toward the ground. The smoke blew, the lights flashed, and then the stage went dark, and the song was over.

An entire week after originally scheduled, Sam Smith finally released their already-TikTok-viral single, “Unholy,” featuring Kim Petras. The iconic pop duo first leaked the song on the platform a month ago, in a short snippet of them jamming out in the car, and those few seconds alone reached 193 million views by the time of the drop on Sep. 22nd.
The song is sexy, menacing, and not at all what fans have come to expect from Smith per their last album (“Love Goes,” full of somber piano ballads and heartbreak anthems) and their other 2022 single (“Love Me More,” about overcoming pains of self-hatred and deep sorrow). “Unholy,” entirely out of left field, thus marks the start of their “villain era,” as Smith told Entertainment Tonight. And, baby, it was “time to get sexy.”
For German pop artist Kim Petras, on the other hand, “Unholy” is definitely not far from the mark. Her 2022 album, “Slut Pop,” features tracks “XXX” and “Throat Goat,” which very much fit into this sexy club era. Despite the gulf between their respective genres, Smith and Petras’ sounds complement each other surprisingly well — Smith’s sobering power versus Petra’s femme fatale.
Lyrically, “Unholy” recounts the adultery of a husband who frequents “The Body Shop,” aka the infamous L.A. strip club. The only person without knowledge of his transgressions is “Mummy” — whereas everyone else is “whisperin' 'bout the places that you've been / And how you don't know how to keep your business clean.” The diction also seems to indirectly suggest that one of the kids of said-husband is actually the one singing about the affair: “Mummy don’t know daddy’s getting hot” and “She’d kick you out if she ever, ever knew / ‘Bout all the shit you tell me that you do.” This point of view derails the sexy narrative Smith sets up but makes it more dynamic as far as their storytelling goes. Perhaps there are more layers of cynicism here than one would think.
These dark undertones are beautifully complemented by the music’s composition — intense bass drums, an intense beat, and ethereal background vocals that ring like pipe-organs. In combination with a minor Middle Eastern chord progression, this eerie cathedral effect gives the track such a heavy and full-bodied sound that the listener is enchanted and forced to hit repeat. With such hauntingly mesmerizing production, it’s not surprising “Unholy” managed to become a TikTok sensation before it was even released.

It was only a few months ago that droves stampeded movie theaters to see the gaudy, campy ode to The King of Rock and Roll that was Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis.” Entranced by Vegas marquees, mumble rock music, and Austin Butler’s Mississippi-Memphis accent, people young and old glimpsed the Elvis-manic culture that defined the mid-century. But the Elvis that Luhrmann introduced to the world appears much like the rocker’s candy-red bedroom: Too rosy to be true. Luhrmann brought the most positive version of Elvis back into cultural consciousness. For months last summer, he trapped viewers in a saccharine shrine to The King, made even sweeter by the almost perfect portrayal that Butler delivered. And now, Sofia Coppola wants to take those same movie-goers back to cotton candy land — maybe.
With a soft, dreamy palette and brooding teenage aesthetic in hand, Sofia Coppola (who is the daughter of Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola) brazenly redefined the indie film scene in the late 1990s and early ’00s with classics like “The Virgin Suicides,” “Marie Antoinette,” and perhaps most famously, “Lost in Translation.” Now, the woman who has become one of the most quintessential female filmmakers of the last thirty years for her dreamlike realism wants to tell the story of an icon clad in sequins and jet black hair, someone whose life almost transcends the bounds of reality: Priscilla Presley.
Even though the headlines for Coppola’s upcoming film seem to only feature casting news about Jacob Elordi as Elvis, the new picture does not actually center around the rock icon. Instead, Coppola focuses on his wife, Priscilla Beaulieu Presley’s, story, outlined in her 1985 memoir “Elvis and Me.” To profile Priscilla Presley seems like an obvious choice, not only given the current Elvis obsession but also because the stories of women like Priscilla are gaining more attention and validity.
Coppola’s announcement comes in the wake of a massive movement to re-empower a more traditional brand of femininity. Cultural feminism is again opening its arms to the women and femme people who identify with conventional versions of womanhood. The housewife and the girly-girl clad in pink are starting to receive the same respect as the woman on Madison Avenue in the power suit. While this long-awaited movement is overwhelmingly positive, it has allowed a few problematic narratives to again take a foothold in pop culture.
As people confidently display gifts from sugar daddies on TikTok or laugh at Leonardo DiCaprio’s revolving door of women below 25, the narrative of an older man dating a younger woman transforms into something not only extremely visible but legitimate. However, while a relationship with a large age gap is acceptable among consenting adults, many children have begun to fetishize this enchanting type of romance and the people, like Priscilla Presley, who exist in it.
Young people have pinned Priscilla Presley as their icon of glamorous femininity. Rates of Pinterest boards enshrining just her hair and fan edits of her honeymoon set to Lana Del Rey’s “Young and Beautiful” have skyrocketed, especially after “Elvis” brought her back into the public eye. She remains one of the few people still praised almost solely for an image related to her late husband. Despite creating a successful line of clothing and skincare products and her award-winning stint on one of the most popular shows of all time, “Dallas,” Presley pushes these personal accomplishments to the back burner in favor of devoting herself to Elvis, even decades after they divorced. People still think of her as the girl with the big hair in the pink suit hopelessly in love with her rockstar because she wants them to. There’s nothing wrong with supporting individuals who dedicate their lives to bolstering the success of those they love, but when Priscilla’s image is praised, specifically, it underpins a culture of manipulation and abuse.
According to “Elvis and Me,” Elvis groomed and dated Priscilla Beaulieu from the time she was fourteen. Ten years her senior and immeasurably more influential, The King slowly turned this teenager into the image of himself, fixing her hair and clothes to embody his perfect woman — a woman that happened to look just like him. [And when she expressed a dissenting opinion, he released an anger “like the roar of thunder,” which Priscilla describes, “Sometimes he lashed out just to drive home a point … Then, ten minutes later, he’d be fine, leaving us bewildered and emotionally depleted … He was truly a master at manipulating people.”
Beneath the tortured soul in the suave leather jacket image was a man who created a doll from a human being and a girl denied her girlhood because of abuse and manipulation. However, when Priscilla tells her story, only sweetness oozes out.
Although there are brief flashes indicating Elvis’s emotional abuse, “Elvis and Me” mostly reads like the diary of a woman still afflicted with Stockholm syndrome, even years after her captor’s death. Priscilla praises her net gain of only 4 pounds during pregnancy as a triumph of her womanly beauty because she maintained Elvis’s affection. She lambasts women like “broad-shouldered” Ursula Andress (an actual Bond girl, considered one of the most beautiful women of her time) because of a romantic rivalry. Her memoir is peppered with the insecurity of a young girl commodified and praised for her physical beauty — a real-life tragedy that has been fetishized by the new, young Elvis fandom because of the king-like aura that was reinforced in “Elvis.”
None of this reality, from the grooming to the manipulation, featured in the Luhrmann film. In fact, Priscilla, despite making up almost 50 percent of Elvis’s life, had less than 15 minutes of screen time in the 159-minute movie. In Baz Luhrmann’s defense, it’s not inherently wrong to omit the more controversial sides of a person’s life story in order to give the public a “fan film.” However, if creators hide the controversial sides of a figure in a piece of media, the truth must be just as public as the fiction in one way or another. The population does not deserve to be manipulated by a solely rosy narrative.
Sofia Coppola has perhaps taken it upon herself to tell the truth, giving a voice to Priscilla that cheers for Elvis only silenced. However, if Coppola (already known for romanticizing female suffering) chooses to follow Priscilla’s sugar-coated tone to the letter, the movie might end up as yet another sickly sweet ode, and too much sweetness can poison a pot.

The year is 1877. The Parisian group of artists who call themselves the Impressionists are displaying their works in an exhibit known as the “Salon of Rejects.” One such “reject,” Mary Cassatt, stands out as being one of only a few women and the only American among them. It was Edgar Degas, a prominent Impressionist painter, who invited Cassatt to join the ranks of the most daring and novel painters of their time, a position which Cassatt eagerly accepted.
From a young age, Cassatt had always dared to be bold. She traveled all over Europe in her youth, believing that the best lessons could be learned through worldly experience and observation. At age fifteen, Cassatt convinced her parents to let her attend the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to pursue her professional aspirations. Soon becoming frustrated with the slow pace and condescending attitudes of her male teachers and peers, Cassatt began her own independent study of the Old Masters, eventually moving to Paris in 1866. There, she honed her skills by taking private lessons with renowned artists, copying the Old Masters’ works, and sketching at the Louvre.
Cassatt was eager to explore new territory through her painting technique and subject matter. While many of her works depict intimate and ordinary scenes of life, they uniquely center women and domesticity in a discipline where such subjects were frequently neglected by male artists unable and unwilling to access those spaces.
“The Mandolin Player” was Cassatt’s first piece to be accepted to the Paris Salon — the world’s most prestigious exhibition at the time whose acceptance was the stamp of artistic approval. This work is a naturalistic and melancholy depiction of a young girl playing a stringed instrument, embodying the subdued and realistic style typical of the time. While this work predates Cassatt’s eventual induction into the ranks of the innovative Impressionists, the subject matter reflects her lifetime interest in domestic and feminine subjects that mainstream artists largely neglected.
Always the adventurer who sought out her own path, Cassatt’s experiments in the 1870s yielded, frustratingly, rejection after rejection from the Paris Salon despite her initial success. Her stagnating career was in part due to the stubbornly conventional tastes of the critics, who denounced Cassatt as too outspoken and headstrong about her own artistic choices. Misogyny played a role as well, and like many institutions at the time, Cassatt found herself unable to break barriers without resorting to currying personal favor with judges and friends connected to the Salon.
But Cassatt found a new path in the form of the Impressionists. A group of artists whose style defied an era or tradition, the Impressionists began displaying their own works in a series of pioneering exhibitions. Edgar Degas in particular saw promise in Cassatt’s works, and his invitation to join sparked a period of creativity in Cassatt’s career as she incorporated elements of his style and took inspiration from his penchant for focusing on a common subject to depict scenes of domestic womanhood.
Cassatt’s style was inspired by the new techniques championed by the Impressionists — attention to light and color, dappled brushstrokes, and a sense of motion evoking an “impression” of a scene that gave the movement its famed moniker. Her painting “In the Loge” features this Impressionist influence and specifically elements from Degas’s style, with blurred brushstrokes and muted pastels and brown tones that convey the gilded elegance of the theater through an unusual visual angle. The painting depicts a woman at the theater using her opera glasses to observe the show as a man watches her through his own binoculars. While women in public spaces were frequently depicted in Impressionism, it is unusual to have the woman shown as an active observer of art rather than just a passive spectacle for the viewer, even though the man essentially objectifies her in the work as well. Cassatt herself was an avid observer, which informed the kinds of subjects she painted — often women engaging in domestic activities that many male painters were not privy to. This painting itself is all about the act of looking, as we observe the woman looking on in a theater, a man gazing at her, and the viewer witnessing these acts of observation, directly engaged in the work.
The 1890s were Cassatt’s most prolific time, as she honed her technique and focused her art around a unifying central theme. While her style became more experimental — she explored print-making and took inspiration from Japanese artistic styles — her subject matter became increasingly single-minded as she painted a series of mother-and-child drawings and scenes of quiet domesticity.
One such example is “The Child’s Bath” (1893), featuring a matronly woman clad in striped linens carefully cleaning the feet of a small child. This work continues to develop her focus on domestic subjects, sharing an intimate and tender moment between a mother (or nurse) and child depicted with elegantly decorative patterns and muted pastels.
While Cassatt frequently painted mothers, she herself never married, viewing marriage as utterly incompatible with a serious artistic career. The deeply institutionalized misogyny of the art world had relegated her to artist and observer, never engaging in the domestic scenes she painted but understanding their intrinsic importance and her role as the portrayer of such a world.
Cassatt is often known due to her proximity to the more famous Degas, but as much as she learned from his techniques, she deserves to be recognized singularly for the brilliance and originality of her works. We can all learn to be bolder from her adventurous life and artistic experimentation, and we can appreciate the beauty of womanhood for its own sake through her sensitive depictions of the domestic sphere, which make her a stand-out figure within a radical group of artists.

How can a research university address problems of health care delivery, especially for the poor or otherwise vulnerable? The late Paul Farmer asked that same question to open an op-ed published in The Crimson eleven years ago this past May. As we commemorate his remarkable life and legacy at a University-wide memorial event on October 1, revisiting this question has never been more urgent.
At the heart of Paul’s vision for mobilizing universities to address global health inequities are two powerful ideas: That health care is a human right and that disparities in health outcomes and access to quality health care are symptoms of deep historical injustices. This moral clarity guided his life’s work, an essential part of which was his commitment to building global health as a vibrant discipline for education, research, and service.
The past few years have seen the coincidence of two major global forces which have highlighted the importance of universities in addressing global health inequities.
First is the growing acknowledgement that health disparities are inseparable from the global history of colonialism which led to the inequitable distribution of power and resources within and between nations — the subject of Paul’s final book.
Second is the deepening of existing health inequities by the pandemic. Witness, for example, higher Covid-19 mortality rates in low-income communities and the offering of now multiple rounds of boosters in wealthy countries while many in less-resourced countries had not even received their first dose. These inequities are all set to worsen as the health consequences of climate change begin to bite deeper, hitting the already worse-off the hardest.
As these global challenges mount, we are called to embrace and advance the legacy Paul left us.
We must do so with a clear moral vision. Strong collaborations with institutions that serve low-income or marginalized populations are at the heart of our efforts to realize global health equity. Such partnerships must be founded upon the kind of long-term, consistent commitment necessary for building deep and mutually rewarding relationships. As Paul argued in his op-ed, it is insufficient to invest solely in one’s own students and faculty; instead, he argued that “every training program at Harvard should be ‘mirrored’ by similar commitments to help our host countries address their own training needs, since in each of these countries there are talented students and trainees who would also like to devote themselves to improving the health of their fellow citizens.” Turning these stirring words into bold action, Paul spearheaded the founding of the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda in 2014, which has since emerged as a major force in the field in the Global South.
The best memorial we can offer for Paul’s untimely passing is critical reflection on how we might further his vision of “accompaniment” — an approach to global health that calls for universities like ours to partner deeply with less-privileged institutions that closely align with our mission. There is no place in global health for those who wish to bungee jump in and out of contexts like tourists. Accompaniment requires a deep and long-term investment in mutual capacity across fields and disciplines. It is essential for these collaborations to be acknowledged as central to the University's mission to create a more equitable world. Our partner institutions offer unprecedented and privileged access to populations in disadvantaged contexts that is essential for global health research and practice. Moreover, we need to emphasize that investing in partnerships with such institutions is not an act of charity but a fulfillment of duty.
We must also acknowledge that global health is not just about people in other countries; vast health disparities persist in the U.S. despite the fact that we spend much more on health care than any other country in the world. Our partnerships must also embrace domestic institutions serving populations with poorer health outcomes and limited access to quality care, including rural communities and low-income neighborhoods.
In the concluding remarks of his op-ed, Paul wrote that “taking global health from a hobby to a serious pursuit is well within our reach if we commit adequate resources to a series of tasks that include research, training, and improved delivery of quality care.” We pride ourselves on being a University committed to solving the world’s most pressing problems through education, research and service, and there can be few issues as important as global health equity.
Eleven years after Paul called on us to treat global health as more than just a hobby, it is time for the University to rededicate itself to the goals and vision that he lived by and animated so brilliantly through partnerships with institutions serving the poor and marginalized. Harvard’s commitment to redress its role in slavery by financing partnerships with historically Black educational institutions in the U.S. offers a model for how we might similarly nurture partnerships with institutions in the Global South. We need to do this both because of our moral responsibility to support equity, social justice, and human rights and dignity and because such partnerships represent a fundamental asset to nurture, support, and value global health. Without this kind of commitment, the mission of Harvard Medical School to “nurture a diverse, inclusive community dedicated to alleviating suffering and improving health and well-being for all through excellence in teaching and learning, discovery and scholarship, and service and leadership” cannot truly be realized.

“Mi nieto va a ser un doctor en América y estudia en Harvard.” “El hijo de mi amiga es un estudiante en Harvard.” “Conocí a un niño que nació aquí en México y ahora está estudiando en Harvard.”
“¡Estamos tan orgullosos de ti! ¡Estás destinado para cosas grandes!”
Harvard, for most of my family, is the equivalent of Hogwarts. It’s a place that is completely unimaginable and beyond our grasp: one where only celebrities, the 1 percent, and Harry Potter and company drink champagne, talk about the latest market trends, and decide where in the world to travel for their next weekend trip.
So, when one of their own is accepted into this illustrious world, the whole family celebrates, from a tequila shot in Monterrey, Mexico, to tears of joy in Saint Louis, Missouri. The miracle news spreads from friends to coworkers to the random stranger that my grandma just had to tell. Soon enough, people from all over the country and world are cheering and telling everybody and anybody who will stop to listen that one of their own has made it.
For me and many others, we have achieved our parents’, grandparents’, and great-grandparents’ dreams. Their hard work has paid off. Their hardships, their sacrifices, their perseverance: It has all culminated in giving us better lives and opportunities than they ever had.
Yet, when you have hundreds of eyes on you awaiting greatness and success, you cannot help but be nervous. You represent them. You represent the generations that helped you achieve your current place. Failure isn’t an option — but at Harvard, where the classes are difficult and everybody is the best of the best, failure always seems to be lurking.
I understand that everyone feels the ever-present pressure at institutions like Harvard to perform well, in comps and classes alike. But the stress felt by me and other students, as products of generations of hardship and sacrifice, does not end when the final exam books close. It shadows us as the moral dilemma of whether we deserve to be here, with all of Harvard’s privilege and prestige, when many of our family members will never experience the same.
As much as I have loved my time at Harvard, I can’t help but feel selfish. I feel selfish for attending Harvard because I know my dad would have loved to do the same if given the opportunity and resources to reach that opportunity earlier in life. There is an emotional dissonance in me between loving Harvard and feeling selfish for being here. Hearing the stories of how my parents grew up, I wish they could have had the same opportunities they constructed for me when they were younger.
The irony is that, in a sense, my dad wanted this selfishness for me: He wanted to give me the resources and support that he never had, so I could fully chase my dreams. I am a temporary oxymoron, as both the egocentric Harvard student and the human record of my family’s history. But my family only ever intended for me to seize my dreams. They never wanted to shoulder me with the burden of the modern Latino Atlas, forever carrying a world of guilt.
Centering ourselves and putting our own oxygen masks on first does not mean the abandonment of family, friends, and communities that have supported us. It does not mean that when we become hotshot lawyers, doctors, or analysts, our families come second. It means that we have the resources for the life our parents could never have dreamed for us and that we can use those resources for others in the same shoes as our parents or grandparents or beyond. We can provide greater opportunities for Latinos from Monterrey, Mexico, to Saint Louis, Missouri. Ultimately, we have the ability to transform the individual saying, “You made it out,” into the global celebration of “We made it out.”
Mamá, Papá, Abuelitos y Abuelitas, los amo con todo mi corazón y un poco más. Estoy agradecido por los sacrificios y por el trabajo que han hecho por mi. Siempre voy a ser su niño chiquito. Los extraño y los veo pronto con un título de Harvard o Hogwarts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every now and then, I go through Instagram withdrawal. Since I joined Instagram, back when its icon was a brown, retro-looking camera and its signature was obnoxious vignette filters, I’ve quit it, returned, deleted the app, re-downloaded it, set niche rules for using it, and gave up on them. This complicated cycle isn’t unique to me or to Instagram; the idea of a social media detox is widespread for people who’ve felt social media’s toll on their relationships, productivity, or mental peace.
Twelve years after its founding, Instagram has come far from its original photo-sharing form. It now has Reels for short videos, Stories for real-time updates, Shops for built-in e-commerce, Explore for a plethora of curated content, and Ads right in your feed. It feels like Instagram will imitate anything to stay relevant, like a middle schooler buying Abercrombie clothes to stay popular.
Why do Instagram and other social media apps try so hard to keep you caring about them? Why is it so hard to stop scrolling and just do nothing? This is the attention economy.
The attention economy rests on the idea that attention is a scarce resource to compete for. In this digital economy, trade is increasingly built around information rather than physical commodities. However, information isn’t scarce; rather, the limiting factor is human attention. Instead of exchanging money, social media and other “free” apps fight for user attention to survive, which often includes using any means necessary to capture user attention and data for ad revenue.
Companies and academics use this idea to reduce human users from equal negotiators of the terms of technology to mere eyes to monetize. For example, the stated mission of the company Meta — formerly Facebook — is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,” but its day-to-day objectives are to increase user engagement and generate ad revenue, leading to design decisions like the “News Feed,” which was only popularized because it successfully increased time spent on the platform. Facebook isn’t the only one: TikTok, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest all make billions off of ad revenue.
Individual users are paying for the attention economy with their mental well-being and autonomy. The battle for user attention has undeniable and well-documented consequences on younger generations’ mental health. Seventy-seven percent of U.S. teens say they use YouTube daily, the most of all social media surveyed in a Pew Research report, and more than one in three teens reported experiencing “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” in 2019, a 40 percent increase since 2009. On campus, similar anecdotes aren’t uncommon: my attention span feels shorter and I can’t focus on assignments after the pandemic, I’m feeling anxious because of constant notifications from my club Slack, or I crashed this weekend because I hadn’t slept well in a week. A constant flow of information takes its toll on a limited human mind.
Instead, if companies weren’t motivated by keeping user attention, perhaps by a subscription model or by payment for services, social media might be designed to benefit users — not exploit their attention and data for profit.
Certain social media companies do actually avoid cheap attention-grabbing schemes through alternative revenue streams. Twitter rolled out its subscription service Twitter Blue last year, reportedly to enable “a better internet for subscribers [and] a better internet for journalism, too”. LinkedIn makes money from enterprise recruitment services and premium subscriptions, and it avoids forcing users onto its feed.
This idea of consumer-first digital transactions has been around for a while, despite being largely unrealized. Ten years ago, Harvard Business School Review Press published “The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge” by Doc Searls, which describes an “intention economy” instead of the “attention economy.” He argues that over the coming years, customer-first agreements will naturally win out over the attention economy. Rather than companies finding cheap ways to track consumer data to sell ads, consumers will set terms based on their values — privacy, personal choice, etc — for companies to build around, rather than companies constructing consumers’ choices.
Meanwhile, we’re still living in an age of attention grabbing; our individual responsibility is to set terms of engagement with social media, treating it not as something designed to benefit us, but rather as something whose true goals we know to be disrupting daily life and nudging towards a corporation’s profits. As much as you can, turn off non-human notifications, decide when to frequent apps on your terms, and ask apps not to track you for their ads.
If you need to, delete TikTok again. Think of something you can do on your homework breaks other than checking your phone.
We’re not entirely powerless actors: One Berkman Klein Center paper describes youth participation in the digital economy. Youth often generate value through “aspirational labor,” which looks like building a following and selling brand deals or launching a creative career online. Viewing social media as a tool to generate attention and brand money for yourself is one other way of setting your terms of engagement with platforms.
It’s not you, it’s your phone. It’s not your lack of self-control, it’s systems that are designed to keep you coming back based on algorithms that are tracking your subconscious behavior.

When Alejandro Gaytan Zepeda ’24, a first-generation, low-income student, first stepped onto campus, he was surprised by aspects of Harvard life.
“I took college courses my high school years, and that was very different from actually coming on the residential campus — opposite side of the country, the $50 billion endowment where the top one percent are,” Gaytan Zepeda said.
Like other freshmen, he received a first-year adviser, meant to facilitate his transition from high school to college. But Gaytan Zepeda said he soon realized Harvard’s formal advising system was ill-equipped to provide the necessary support.
“The infrastructure wasn’t really there for me,” he said. “I don’t think the adviser had the proper training in terms of how to provide resources. I had to do a lot of digging myself.”
Gaytan Zepeda said he ultimately leaned on upperclassmen for support.
Harvard undergraduates receive a series of advisers over the course of their four years at the College. During freshman year, students receive a first-year adviser, who may also be their live-in proctor. Freshmen also receive a Peer Advising Fellow — upperclassmen assigned to check in with individual freshmen.
During sophomore year, students are paired with a tutor in their house before receiving a concentration adviser specific to their declared field of study.
Though Gaytan Zepeda described his first two years at Harvard as “difficult” due to insufficient support from his assigned advisers, he acknowledged the advising system’s “crucial role” in helping students from all backgrounds succeed in the face of Harvard’s rigor.
Indeed, Harvard lauds its advising system as “the key to ensuring that [students] are able to explore fully all of the curricular and co-curricular opportunities that exist as part of the liberal arts and sciences education,” according to its website.
But some students and advisers are less convinced of its merits.
For some undergraduates, assigned advisers have fulfilled their roles well, serving as valuable guides through the uncertainties and challenges of undergraduate life.
Sidnee N. Klein ’25 said her first-year adviser helped her steer through both the social and academic pressures of Harvard.
“My first-year adviser was really helpful,” Klein said. “I felt like our advising sessions were simultaneously about my mental health but also the trajectory of my classes and [the adviser] was very supportive.”
Victoria M. Zhang ’24 said her advisers were not overbearing but always available when she reached out for help.
“The advisers I’ve had, most of them have been not super hands-on — which I like,” Zhang said. “Anytime I reach out to them, they respond quickly with very good feedback.”
But others have pointed to gaps in advising system's ability to provide individualized counsel, particularly in light of the unique and varied backgrounds of Harvard's undergraduates: Of the current freshman class, 15.3 percent hail from outside the United States, and a record-high 19.4 percent are the first in their family to attend college.
Alida S. Andon ’25, a first-generation college student, said her first-year adviser and proctor were unable to provide sufficient guidance on how to navigate pre-med requirements.
“I didn’t really have great advising until sophomore year. I feel freshman year, they just weren’t really guiding me in the direction I needed,” Andon said. “I didn’t know any of the requirements. I didn’t know the pre-med track.”
Andon attributed the challenges to the fact that it was her proctor’s first year in the role and added that her adviser, who also held a dean position, was “really busy."
Aracely J. Davila ’25 said a “lack of communication” characterized her freshman advising experience.
“I only talked to my adviser twice my whole first year, so I think communication is what was lacking,” Davila said. “It was really up to me to go and find those resources in the first year.”
Before registration each term, students are required to meet with their adviser to get their classes approved and registration hold lifted. In contrast to her previous advising experience, Klein said her sophomore adviser’s role has been relegated to signing off on courses she has already selected.
“I’ve needed to navigate — almost advise — myself and then just get confirmation from my advisers,” Klein said of her experience this semester.
Ruppert-Gómez said meetings with her adviser have been condensed into meeting once per semester for “10, 15 minutes over Zoom” to get her registration hold lifted. She added she feels there is “a gap” in her relationship with her concentration adviser because her career questions are often outsourced to other resources like Harvard’s Office of Career Services.
“There’s some barrier somehow, and I don’t know how to overcome that,” Ruppert-Gomez said. “It’s hard to find someone to really direct you, in my opinion, and someone that can not only direct you but you can build that connection with.”
Dissatisfied with Harvard’s formal system, some students have turned to older classmates for advice on how to navigate classes, social scenes, and careers.
“I’ve actually had more advising on classes and what to take and what not to take and more advice from my classmates and peers than my actual adviser,” Marcella R. Ruppert-Gómez ’23 said.
In an emailed statement, Advising Programs Office Director Aliya S. Bhimani wrote that Harvard students are encouraged to seek informal advisers such as peers and faculty members, noting that "everyone is willing to help in our community."
“The beauty of the College’s broad advising network is that it includes peer advising fellows (PAFs), who are in fact older students,” Bhimani wrote. “An advising network is large, and students shouldn’t feel bound by certain individuals alone, but should feel empowered to reach out widely.”
Aeden Marcus ’25 said she has been “very happy” with her assigned advisers but finds it “frustrating” that most academic advising happens so close to the time of course registration.
“It sometimes is frustrating to not be able to get advising until the week before you choose classes or the week that you’re choosing classes,” Marcus said. “Harvard does everything so late, but now we don’t have shopping week — it’s different.”
In May, more than 60 percent of Harvard’s faculty voted to replace shopping week — a longtime scheduling quirk that allowed students to sample classes during the week before the start of term — with previous-term registration. The faster registration timeline is set to go into effect in spring 2024, raising the question of how the role of academic advising may be impacted.
Shopping week was overwhelmingly popular among undergraduates, with more than 96 percent voting in favor of keeping it during a Sept. 2021 referendum.
Bhimani, the APO director, said the adoption of previous-term course registration “necessitates change” in Harvard’s advising programs.
“Efforts have thus far gone into understanding how advising and support networks currently work back on campus after the pandemic necessitated shifts, and identifying what gaps or challenges exist with advising, with an eye to future change and enhancement,” Bhimani wrote.
Advisers are typically Harvard staff members, faculty, or graduate students who opt to advise undergraduates on top of their full-time roles.
Kenneth Alyass, a non-resident tutor in Leverett House who advises History concentrators, said he was “amazed” by the advising Harvard offered its students compared to his undergraduate experience.
At the same time, Alyass questioned the “trade-off” the system creates for those who choose to be advisers.
“I feel like universities want to do this stuff really well, but on the cheap, too,” Alyass said. “You think about these roles — concentration adviser, res adviser, all these various advisers, proctor positions. Ostensibly, they could all be full-time faculty positions that just emphasize advising and teaching a bit more than research, similar to what they do at private liberal arts colleges.”
Alyass said the system might be improved if faculty members were to fulfill the advising role.
“Would it look differently if we had full-time staff members doing this stuff instead of grad students or other weird positions?” he added.
One proctor, who spoke to The Crimson on the condition of anonymity out of job security concerns, said they feel “stretched” by having to provide academic advising they feel unprepared for. Last semester, The Crimson reported some proctors felt elevated levels of burnout and tension, with some proctors advising double the typical number of students.
“Other universities don’t just outsource this important role to the community. They hire folks who have studied this and know the ins and outs of the curriculum and can really advise students in meaningful and individualized ways,” they said. “Harvard can do better and I hope that they do pay knowledgeable staff to be the advisers for students in the future.”
In response to concerns about Harvard’s advising system, Bhimani wrote that “there are many models for success.”
Outside of the College’s academic advising system, Harvard hires full-time staff in the Office of Career Services, who answer students’ career questions.
The proctor also said they felt “ill-prepared” to provide academic advising for freshmen transitioning into college, despite attending trainings hosted by the Board of First-Year Advisers.
Bhimani wrote in her statement that the Advising Programs Office “leaned in heavily on training and supporting all advisers ahead of this academic year.”
“Advisers were offered in-person and virtual training sessions, recorded sessions, presentations and a robust tool kit of resources in a new centralized online Advising Portal,” Bhimani wrote. “Regular communication to members of the advising network continues to support the community throughout the year via newsletters, active Slack groups, on-going training sessions, and consultation with the APO when challenges arise.”
In addition to training, all first-year advisers — excluding PAFs — receive confidential information about their students, including their Common App materials and test scores, in order to facilitate personalized advice.
“I’m very grateful that Harvard actually gave me all this context. Otherwise, I would have been very uncomfortable just walking in blind and having to force the student to tell me all these things,” said Pablo Lozano, a new proctor this year. “Harvard was pretty kind in the sense that they weren’t making the students have to retell their story over and over and over again.”
Outside of offering academic advice, proctors and advisers also provide emotional support for students.
“The fine line between academic advising and proctoring isn’t always clear because I think oftentimes personal issues blend into the academic aspect,” Lozano said. “I’ve genuinely appreciated being able to be a resource that can be accessed at any hour of the day, anytime of the week.”
“It’s just helpful to have someone there constantly reminding you and showing you what resources and opportunities are available at an institution like this,” he added.
In a September interview, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said the College is currently focused on improving freshman advising.
“What we’re going to be looking at in the future is how we strengthen advising for first-year students who have not yet arrived on campus, and how to understand how to navigate their academic choices as well as understand the Harvard system more critically,” Khurana said.
Khurana said he hopes “fact-based information” becomes more accessible and accurate, making advising more efficient for both parties.
“In an ideal world, the advisers would then spend more time working with certain questions and hearing the student’s perspective and points of view instead of looking for that information,” Khurana said.
In her statement, Bhimani wrote that the APO in the last year has focused on improving training for both proctors, non-resident first-year advisers, and broader College staff.
Maria Keselj ’23, a three-time PAF, said training this year was more substantial than what the APO provided in past years.
“This last year was my first time getting official PAF training. We arrived on campus three days early and had full days of speeches from people and going through scenarios,” said Keselj, a former Crimson Editorial editor. “My first year being a PAF it was the complete opposite — I was kind of just thrown into the deep end.”
The APO expanded the PAF role this year, training PAFs for the first time to provide academic advising to freshmen — a shift Keselj described as a "complete 180."
“Just this year, they introduced an academic advising portion to the role,” Keselj said. “There’s a perspective that I feel upperclassmen can give on classes, which students can’t otherwise obtain through academic advisers or proctors, so it was a good change.”
Still, some students expressed hope for reforms to Harvard’s upperclassman advising system as well.
Gaytan Zepeda said he hopes the College can include an “FGLI voice” in designing changes going forward.
Darian I. Benitez Sanchez ’25 said he misses the many “links to support” that he had through his freshman advising network.
“I really liked the structure where, especially for first-years, you have a PAF and you have your proctor, it’s so many links to support,” Benitez Sanchez said. “That was the best part about the advising system. And if there’s a way to really ramp that up, that would be great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days before Harvard’s football game against Brown University in Providence, R.I., Nicole T. Rozelman ’23 and her friends sat in the Lowell House dining hall and rushed to find four tickets on the same train.
“It’s kind of funny,” she said. “We all clicked ‘book,’ basically at the same time, so we were sure that we would all get tickets.”
After a week of hearing friends talk about turning out for the game, Rozelman was convinced she had to be there.
Harvard’s football team faced off against Brown last week, bringing home a win, 35-28. Droves of Harvard students traveled by train to party at tailgates, watch the football game, and visit friends in Providence.
Varvara Lyapneva ’26, a freshman from Moscow, said she made the nearly 50-mile trip to escape the “Harvard bubble.”
“Since I'm an international student, I haven't seen much of the United States,” she said. “So I wanted to go and see how Brown looks and also spend time with my friends outside of the Harvard bubble.”
Lyapneva, who traveled to Brown by Amtrak, said the cost of travel was a barrier for attendance.
“It's kind of costly, so I took the earliest train which was at 6:30 a.m.,” she said.
Some students said their academic workloads made the trip difficult.
“It's kind of hard to get out of Harvard at any given point, because you always feel like you have work to do,” Lyapneva said. “And traveling somewhere will definitely take you almost an entire day that you spent not doing anything.”
Zoe C. Cooper ’25 said she sat on the Brown side during the game because she was visiting a friend who attends Brown.
“It wasn't that packed over there [on Harvard’s side],” she said. “I saw a lot of people outside the game at the tailgate or just standing in line to get in.”
Joya H. Cooper-Hohn ’24 said being able to resume in-person activities has been really enjoyable.
“Our freshmen year was during Covid so I think we missed out on a lot of the in-person activities, like going to football games, so it was really fun to get to go down to Brown.”
Felipe M. Albors ’25, a student intern at the Harvard Office of Athletic Communications, said the game was “exciting” and that he hopes more students will engage with Harvard Athletics.
“I'm going to be working with the communications office trying to get students more involved in athletics in general, and I think that people were really receptive to the content that we put out,” Albors said.
“I think they did a really good job promoting Brown, and then the students who arrived there, the atmosphere was just great,” he added.
Though many Harvard students didn’t attend the actual game, Albors said, tailgates could be a great way to boost turnout.
“I don't think it's a problem for sports in general that the entertainment factor outside of the game is what draws most people — or what draws a significant portion of students — to the game,” Albors said. “I think that that's ultimately good. Having a good tailgate culture around the game will bring people to the game naturally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing inflation and larger class sizes, the Harvard Undergraduate Association met with College administrators Thursday to request $682,000 in funding for the 2023 fiscal year.
If approved, the budget would be the largest in Harvard student government history — a marked increase from the Undergraduate Council’s approximately $500,000 yearly allocation.
The HUA executives submitted a 20-page proposal to the Student Activities Fee Advisory Committee, requesting funding that would be allocated toward student clubs and campus-wide initiatives, as well as HUA programs and team retreats.
According to the document, the budget increase would boost club funding by 14 percent, compared to funding under the UC. The proposal also stressed the Association’s commitment to rigorous financial accounting processes.
“The budget proposal is a testament to our commitment to prioritizing club funding and launching innovative programs that all students can benefit from,” wrote HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 in a statement to The Crimson.
Line items included in the budget proposal include $7,000 for a “Finance Team Retreat,” $4,000 for a “QuadFest” event, $3,000 for an HUA “Executive Team Retreat” in the Student Organization Center at Hilles, and $6,750 for spiked drink testing strips.
Dean of Students Office representative and HUA adviser Jason R. Meier, who attended the meeting, said in an interview that it is possible the HUA will not receive their requested amount – or even as much as the UC — due to falling participation in the Student Activities Fee.
Four bodies — the HUA, the College Events Board, housing committees, and the Harvard Foundation Student Advisory Committee — are funded by the Student Activities Fee, a $200 charge automatically applied to the tuition bill of every College student.
Students are able to opt out of this fee, however — a choice that Meier says is gaining popularity.
“It is not a new phenomenon,” Meier said in an interview with The Crimson Thursday. “It has increased over the last few years pretty significantly, and it’s having a real impact on student orgs for sure.”
The HUA expects to receive a response next week, according to Johnson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council discussed plans to create a pair of committees to address issues affecting the city’s Black residents during a Thursday meeting.
The public hearing, held by the Council’s Civic Unity Committee, centered around two policy orders — one to establish a Task Force To Examine the Status and Wellbeing of the City’s African American/Black Population and the second to create a Commission on the Status of Black Men and Boys.
The Council adopted both orders at the beginning of August.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons, who sponsored both policy orders, said in an email she hopes the two committees will serve as a lasting force for combating racial inequities in Cambridge.
“I’m interested in figuring out how we can implement something that is solution-oriented, that becomes a part of the City’s DNA, and that is built to evolve and gain momentum long after a new crop of elected officials and administration officials have arrived,” Simmons wrote.
While discussions around racial equity in Cambridge have been ongoing for decades, she said, the city has failed to make it a priority in practice.
“As a city, we tend to place our focus on the most urgent problems of the moment,” she wrote. “After we have made that headway, another, newer problem rises up and grabs our attention, and maybe we take our eye off the ball from the original issue we were addressing.”
The second policy order is modeled off a similar program in Boston, which has had a Black Men and Boys Commission — housed in the city’s Office of Black Male Advancement — since 2021. Boston’s Black Men and Boys Commission was initially proposed by a city councilor in 2014, but it was vetoed by former Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.
Isaac H. Yablo, the policy and research director at the Boston Office of Black Male Advancement, originally proposed that Cambridge create its own commission in a policy recommendation sent to the Council in May.
Yablo said in an interview that a government body dedicated to advocating for Black men and boys specifically — rather than people of color in general — would help address inequities in Boston and Cambridge.
“There’s plenty of data that show that there is a need for this commission to exist,” Yablo said. “Particular marginalized populations within the BIPOC community often get forgotten.”
According to Yablo’s proposal, similar offices or commissions focusing on advocacy for Black men also exist in Portland, Ore., Baltimore, and Philadelphia.
In her email, Simmons said it was “imperative” that the city also consider the experience of Black women and girls in Cambridge.
“I believe we need to see what the experience of ALL these individuals is, what programs we have that are currently supporting these folks, and what additional supports could be effective,” Simmons wrote.
The proposed Commission on the Status of Black Men and Boys will give policy recommendations to the Council and the city manager on a range of issues, including housing, economic opportunity, education, incarceration, and public health, according to the policy order.
The order specifies that the commission’s membership should include community activists, faith leaders, educators, and students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took two elections, two debates, and eight days longer than expected, but the Harvard Kennedy School has finally elected a new student government.
Sam Yoon, a second-year master’s of public policy student, was elected student body president of the Kennedy School on Wednesday. Yoon’s running mate, first-year MPP student Cara E. Oneal-Radigan, will serve as executive vice president.
Interim student government leadership, which led the body over the summer break, suspended the first election on Sept. 20, after an IT failure resulted in dozens of students failing to receive any information about the electoral process. Prior to its suspension, the initial election was mired in controversy for weeks because candidates were running unopposed for several positions — including for president.
But many of the problems from the first election persisted during the Kennedy School’s second attempt at electing a student government.
Another IT issue forced some first-year MPP students to manually vote by emailing their ballot rather than using the official voting platform. Several positions also remained uncompetitive, including the role of executive vice president, for which Oneal-Radigan ran uncontested.
Imogen M. A. Hobby, interim HKS student government president, and Bethany M. Kirkpatrick, interim vice president, wrote in a statement Thursday that 13 votes for the first-year MPP class representative were cast manually, with the remaining 146 votes submitted through the voting platform after the error was fixed.
“No other positions were affected by the IT issue,” Hobby and Kirkpatrick wrote.
“We are grateful to the student body for their continued engagement in the election process and we look forward to seeing the newly elected KSSG get to work on the issues that matter to our community,” Hobby and Kirkpatrick wrote in a separate statement Thursday.
Oneal-Radigan said she was “very surprised” to learn she was the sole candidate for executive vice president.
Asked if the lack of competition for the role reflected a general disinterest in student government, Oneal-Radigan said she wonders if the student government “feels like a step down” for people who have served in various levels of U.S. and foreign governments.
“In this school, so many people have experience in the U.S. government and local state governments and governments of other countries, because there are so many international people,” she said. “I think people have big ambitions and that doesn’t necessarily translate to student government for everybody.”
Omar M. Awad, a first-year, mid-career master’s of public administration student, ran unopposed for president in the first election. But he faced a larger field in the second election, with five other candidates entering the race.
Awad, who lost the presidential race to Yoon, said that the electoral process “wasn’t perfect,” in an interview Thursday.
“Unfortunately, I was on the receiving end of that,” Awad said. “But this is something that I am also committed to continue to work on — on making it definitely better the next time around.”
Sergio Herrera Carranza, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president of professional development in the second election, said “it’s regrettable” that the Kennedy School student body was unable to smoothly execute a student government election.
“It has been really tough for me to try to organize events because we still don’t have a student government,” Herrera Carranza said. “It is literally like a month where we cannot do anything, we cannot get budget for activities, we cannot get anything approved.”
“It is ironic and sad,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts state officials outlined plans on Wednesday to revitalize Herter Park in Allston by improving access to the Charles River and narrowing Soldier’s Field Road to create space for “green transportation.”
The state released its 2022 Herter Park Master Plan earlier this month, which outlined proposals to improve the 56-acre area alongside the Charles River.
Ginna Johnson, deputy chief of design and project management at the state Department of Conservation and Recreation, said the plan will help “enhance public access” to the river, “restore a healthy riverbank and parkland ecology,” and “reflect the cultural values” of the park.
The master plan outlines recommendations to improve access to the park by instituting a “road diet” that would eliminate the westbound lanes on Soldier’s Field Road in favor of a shared-use path. The eastbound lanes would be reconfigured for two-way traffic.
Under the plan, high school rowing operations would also be relocated to part of a revitalized Herter Center.
The master plan would “reduce the volume of runoff that reaches the sewer system or the Charles River, through the reduction of impervious surfaces and the use of bioretention and vegetated swales,” it said.
It would also seek to improve community gardens by adding raised garden beds and mesh fencing.
But some attendees at the meeting raised concerns about the state’s plans for the park, citing prolonged construction timelines.
Longtime Allston resident Anthony P. “Tony” D’Isidoro said at the webinar that the construction period required for the “road diet” would hinder access to the river over the next several years.
“Development activity in the community has not ceased — as a matter of fact, it’s being accelerated, especially along Soldier’s Field Road and Western Ave.,” D’Isidoro said. “And it has a direct impact on access and safety to all the great work that the DCI wants to do to Herter Park.”
Johnson, the DCR representative, said the construction would be worth it in the long term.
“We like to say that DCR is in the forever business — projects feel like they take forever,” she said. “This one is coming just as quickly as a new project can.”
Galen Mook, the executive director of Massachusetts Bicycle Coalition, said he supports the “road diet” plan, but worries about communication between city and state agencies.
“I’ve been to these meetings and I don’t have confidence that the left hand and the right hand are talking to each other,” he said, referring to the city of Boston and the DCR.
Mook called for more “public facing” dialogues between the two governments. Other attendees said the proposal would inhibit vehicular traffic, including ambulances, on the road.
“There’s a range of opinions here,” Johnson said. “DCR has a lot of work to do to balance perspectives and to analyze metrics.”
The state will accept public comments on its proposal through Oct. 12.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team split its four games at the Aggie Round Up in California, easily handling Occidental College and winning an overtime thriller against No. 13 University of California Irvine to elevate the Crimson’s ranking to No. 12 in the country.
The contest against UC Irvine (6-6, 0-0), which was the final match of the round-robin tournament, saw Harvard (5-3, 0-0) battle back from a three-goal deficit heading into the final period to force overtime. First-year utility man James Rozolis-Hill punctuated his five-goal performance with the winner in the extra period, propelling the Crimson to an 18-17 victory. Junior attacker Alexandru Bucurchipped in four goals for his first multi-goal showing of the year.
Senior attacker and captain Alex Tsotadze hopes that the victory will provide confidence to the team whenever it faces adversity later in the season.
“It gives us hope down the line, if we're ever in a situation where we're trailing going into the fourth quarter,” Tsotadze said. “We can always rally behind those early season victories that we had where we were able to come from behind and play as a unit. It gives us that confidence and state of mind that since we've been in this position earlier in the season, we know what it takes.”
Against Occidental (2-8, 0-0), Harvard dominated play early on and led 10-4 heading into halftime. The Crimson put the contest out of reach in the third quarter of the eventual 19-9 win, tacking on seven goals in the period, including five unanswered. Junior center Kaleb Archer, who starred with four goals, led the third-quarter explosion, which also featured goals from Rozolis-Hill, senior defender Gabe Putnam, and junior attacker Owen Hale.
In addition to its victories, Harvard nearly upset No. 2 UCLA and No. 5 University of Pacific on consecutive days.
The contest against UCLA (13-1, 0-0) was a back-and-forth affair, containing 11 lead changes. Harvard started strong and led 10-7 at the break, but the third quarter saw a reversal of fortunes, as UCLA outscored Harvard 6-2 in the period. Ultimately, the Crimson lost by a single goal, 16-15. Rozolis-Hill led the scoring with five goals, while senior goalie Noah Hodges played great defense with nine saves.
In the game against the University of Pacific (13-2, 0-0), Harvard fell behind early, 3-2 and could never grab the lead. Losing the third quarter 4-2 put the Crimson in a hole heading into the fourth. The deficit proved too difficult to overcome and Harvard fell 15-11.
Despite the defeats, the team took away key lessons from its battles against highly-ranked teams that will serve it well as the season progresses.
“It was a great opportunity for us to test our schemes and our strategies against the best teams in the country,” Tsotadze said. “We can take away bits and pieces of tactical things that they do really well and that we can implement within our program to be more successful moving down the line.”
Looking ahead, the Crimson travel to New Jersey and New York this weekend to face Iona, St. Francis College Brooklyn, and Princeton in the start of Northeast Water Polo Conference (NWPC)  play. The slate represents a chance for Harvard to make a statement to the rest of the conference early on.
“This weekend will be a great opportunity for us to solidify ourselves as the number one team in the conference by winning on the road and setting ourselves up to defend our home court advantage when we play later in the season,” Tsotadze said.
The weekend’s matchups contain both a long-standing rivalry and a chance at revenge.
“Anytime we play Princeton, we know it's going to be a big game because we have a big rivalry with Princeton,” Tsotadze noted. “It's going to be a great opportunity, especially for the younger guys to play Princeton, at Princeton, for the first time. We’re looking to win there.”
Saint Francis knocked the Crimson out of the conference semifinals season, a loss that the team’s captain hasn’t forgotten.
“It's going to be a great opportunity for us to get rid of that bad taste we have in our mouths from last year and also play in a really high energy environment at St. Francis,” he said.
Tsotadze expects the trip to Brooklyn, like the games in California, will provide valuable lessons for the less experienced members on the team.
“They always get a really great crowd out, so it's a good experience for the younger guys to really get a game under their belts where there's going to be a hostile crowd,” he explained.
The team likely won’t have to worry much about the performance of one first-year of the team. Rozolis-Hill continued his dominant start to the season during the trip to California, scoring 16 goals throughout the weekend. He had a hat-trick in each game – a feat he has achieved in seven of the first eight games – and raised his goal total to 31 on the season. Although it is early in the season, his current goals-per-game average of 3.88 would be a program record.
“It's been awesome to see James step into a really big role early on,” Tsotadze said. “He's just so dynamic on the offensive end and he can play any position in the pool. He's always able to create space to get open and make himself available for the ball. James has really solidified himself as one of the best players on the East Coast already.”

Let’s face it: fall is here and your days of wishing for AC are over. Not to get too dark here– pun intended– but winter is coming. You should probably take advantage of the Vitamin D and fresh air before we all go into hibernation, and your only glimpse of sunlight is on your frantic dash from the Science Center to Berg. The point is, you should try ~studying outside~, but if you’re anything like me, you know it is nearly impossible to nail down the perfect outdoor study situation. There’s nothing worse than packing up your belongings, trekking down to the river and then realizing you’ve forgotten something, or that your laptop is about to die. Or maybe you’ve chosen to study in the Yard, but the only thing you can focus on is being the perfect muse for the tourists’ awaiting cameras #can’thelpit. But fear not because this is Flyby’s guide to studying outside this autumn!
Charge it up
This tip, arguably the most important of all, requires some forethought. But—I believe in you. Charge your devices. That means your laptop and iPad should be full of juice when you embark on your journey. And if for some mysterious reason your devices just happen to run out of battery, what a shame: you’ve stumbled upon the perfect excuse to take a sun nap or immerse yourself in the sites and sounds of Cambridge nature.
Fuel and Hydration 
We all know that studying when you’re hungry is a slippery slope that always results in hanger and half-assed psets. So, make sure you have enough Trader Joe’s snacks in your bag to feed a monster before you sit down and realize you are that monster, and you’re starving. Don’t have time to hit TJ’s? Grab a piece of fruit and some yogurt at FlyBy, or maybe a cup of off-brand cereal to munch on from the dhall. Feeling boujee? Make a stop at Black Sheep or Tatte and get some top notch eats for the day. And don’t forget hydration! Your water bottle better be filled, and no, your pumpkin spice latte is not a replacement for water (though I endorse drinking both simultaneously).
Prep for the Elements
Looking out your window it may seem like a smoking hot day, but don’t be deceived. The minute you let your guard down, that crisp autumn breeze will hit you with a nice reality check. Winter is coming, babe. Bring a jacket! Even if you’re sweating when you leave your dorm, throw a hoodie in your bag because when you end up sitting down to study, the sun won’t be so high in the sky anymore and the goosebumps will start to set in. On the other hand, make sure you are also ready for the sun. Can’t have that UV giving us wrinkles before we’re 30! We’re manifesting the agelessness of J.Lo here. Pack some sunscreen or maybe a baseball hat. Also sunnies! Can’t be squinting into the sun trying to decipher your super important Gened paper that you definitely didn’t put off until the last minute—so shades up.
Location
So, the question of where this outdoor studying will take place… the options are nearly endless. If you’re feeling photogenic, I suggest studying anywhere near the John Harvard statue. Want to catch the traffic between Berg and the Science Center? You should probably sit on one of those red chairs in the plaza. Want to watch runners fighting for their lives along the Charles? Pull out a picnic blanket or stake out one of the benches along the river. Want to take part in a “great community?” Go to the Quad lawn. If you really feel like adventuring, make the hike across the river and sit at a picnic table behind the SEC—you can even spend some BoardPlus while you’re at it (don’t let that free money go to waste!).
And with that, you are now fully equipped to brave the great outdoors and maybe even study a little while you’re at it. Don’t let the turkeys and tourists scare you off! Procrastinating—I mean working—outside is good for the soul (seasonal depression who?). You could be productively avoiding your midterm prep anywhere, so you may as well do it outside :)
