After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Freshman Tommy McCarthy, calm and in rhythm, flashed a three-point sign at the Princeton fans. With 13 minutes remaining in the second half, McCarthy’s fourth trey of the game had cut what was a 19-point lead to 10. Harvard, which had come back from 16 down a week ago to briefly take a second half-lead against Cornell, was on an 11-3 run. The unnerved Tigers took a timeout as a raucous crowd at Jadwin Gymnasium fell silent.
It didn’t take long for them to get back on their feet.
After Princeton forward Henry Caruso put the lead at 13 with a three, Harvard missed two of four free throws on the next possession. The teams then engaged in the least balanced of swaps—three straight Princeton treys against three Harvard turnovers—as Princeton pushed the lead to 24.
Princeton’s 13-0 run took just under two minutes and sealed an 83-62 victory that appeared to put the final nail in the coffin for Harvard’s Ivy League hopes. The Tigers (13-5, 3-1 Ivy League) sent Harvard (9-12, 1-4) to its fourth straight Ivy League loss for the first time in nine years.
“I certainly didn’t think that we put forth the best effort that we’ve seen out of our team this season so it was really a tough night,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
All night, the Crimson missed junior star forward Zena Edosomwan, who sat to nurse a persistent thigh injury suffered last weekend. With captain Evan Cummins—whose 1.6 blocks a game ranks second in the league—sitting the entire second half with strep throat, Princeton drove the paint at will. For the game, Princeton had 38 points in the paint and made 61 percent of its two-pointers.
Sophomore Chris Egi, Harvard’s lone big man for most of the evening, was effective defending Princeton’s centers but could not help quick enough on the Tigers’ shifty wings. While forwards Alec Brennan and Pete Miller combined for just three baskets in 31 minutes, wings Caruso, Steven Cook, and Spencer Weisz had 53 points.
When Princeton missed, however, it typically came up with the ball. Of Princeton’s 33 misses on the day, it rebounded 15. Caruso had five offensive rebounds alone en route to a 19-point, eight-rebound, six-assist night.
Amaker noted that the absence of Edosomwan, who leads the league in total rebound percentage, contributed—but did not excuse—Harvard’s struggles.
“It’s not comfortable or easy for the guards to drive it in there if he’s in there,” Amaker said. “It’s a big void, but you know, everyone has something they are trying to make up for.”
The Tigers’ lone starting wing not to score in double digits—sophomore Amir Bell (four points in 31 minutes)—was instrumental in instigating Princeton’s full-court press. Harvard, who leads the Ivy League in turnovers, found its offense bogged down from the beginning of the contest by its 19 turnovers and 11 missed free throws.
Bell, Weisz, and freshman Devin Cannady led an active Princeton press that put Harvard on its heels early and often. While the Tigers just had seven steals on the game, its pressure prevented Harvard from getting into its offensive sets and took reserves Patrick Steeves and Corbin Miller (six turnovers, eight points) out of the game.
In the first half, its pressure turned a 4-3 deficit into a 19-6 lead in just five minutes as Jadwin Gymnasium roared early and often. After the Crimson’s first set of three consecutive giveaways, the Tigers pushed the lead to 19. It entered the break up 16, making 48 percent of its shots and 46 percent of its threes in the first period.
“We definitely got ourselves into a hole,” McCarthy, who led the team with 16 points, said. “It’s always tough to get back because you have to exert so much energy.”
For the game, Harvard pulled off an improbable feat that has become customary: shooting better from the field than the foul line. The Crimson made 48 percent of its field goals against just 45 percent of its foul attempts, which dragged down an offense that otherwise shot 58 percent in the second half. Before making four of its final six free throws, Harvard hit only five of its first 10, including an airball from Cummins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—After the Harvard men’s hockey team bowed out of last year’s Beanpot, the Crimson needed more than a few days to recover.
Four days after its double-overtime defeat, Harvard—ranked sixth in the country—looked lost in a 3-0 loss at Yale. One night later, the Crimson hit rock bottom, falling to a Brown team that entered the contest with just one conference win in 15 tries.
History had a chance to repeat itself this weekend, as No. 7/7 Harvard embarked on the same ECAC road trip—only in reverse order—after falling to No. 4/4 Boston College in Monday’s Beanpot semifinals. But this time, the Crimson avoided falling victim to the post-Beanpot blues, kicking off the weekend with a 3-2 win over the Bears at Pollard Family Rink.
Harvard (13-5-3, 9-3-3 ECAC) controlled the bulk of the first two periods on Friday, jumping out to a 2-0 edge less than a minute into the middle frame. But after Brown (4-15-4, 2-11-3) made something out of nothing on two separate occasions to pull even at two, the Crimson needed to utilize a late power play in order to squeeze out its first road win over the Bears since Feb. 22, 2011.
With less than four minutes to play in regulation, Harvard’s first line went to work. After defenseman Tyler Wood knocked junior Alexander Kerfoot off the puck with a big hit behind the Brown net, co-captain Kyle Criscuolo jumped into the mix and tipped the puck back to his center.
Kerfoot pounced, wrapping around junior goaltender Tim Ernst’s left post and attempting a shot before Bears rookie Tommy Marchin got his stick in the way. But with Ernst down on all fours, the puck squirted its way to the far post, where Criscuolo hammered home the game-winner with 3:15 remaining.
“We just found a way,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.  “It would have been a frustrating one to have slip away because I thought we really played well…. Our effort in the third was good, and we found a way to win.”
The power play—just the Crimson’s second of the game—was awarded to Harvard after an official deemed Brown forward Max Willman tripped sophomore Wiley Sherman as the defenseman moved beyond his own blue line with 4:26 to go. Willman made minor contact with Sherman’s left leg, but the 6’7” blue-liner spun around like a top after being bumped, prompting the referee to raise his arm.
The call proved to be a crucial one in a game that felt one-sided just one period earlier. Harvard looked poised to run away with the contest late in the second period when co-captain Jimmy Vesey netted what appeared to be his second goal of the game to put the Crimson up 3-0. But the senior’s rip from above the slot was disallowed after the referees ruled Kerfoot interfered with Ernst atop the goalmouth.
Skating with new life, the Bears lit the lamp just one minute later. With about a foot separating Marchin and the goal line, the Barnstable, Mass., native somehow found a hole against sophomore netminder Merrick Madsen with 1:08 to go in the period, cutting the lead in half.
Then 4:57 into the final frame, junior forward Zack Pryzbek scored from nearly the same impossible angle on the opposite end of the rink, turning and blasting a shot over the left shoulder of Madsen from deep in the right corner to even the score at two.
“They scored two goals off of what I would say are pucks they just threw at the net,” Donato said. “I’m not sure that either one of them would be considered a good scoring chance.”
The two wild shots erased the lead Harvard built over the first 21 minutes. With just over five to play in the opening period, Sherman opened the scoring with a slapper from the blue line off a feed from Vesey. Until seeing the celebrations in front of him, Ernst thought he made the save, but the puck trickled through the junior’s pads at 14:37.
Then 25 seconds into the middle frame, Kerfoot intercepted a Josh McArdle shot and split the seam between two defenders with a pass ahead to Vesey, who fired a wrister into the top right corner of the net on the breakaway.
“I don’t even think he got all of it,” Kerfoot said with a laugh. “When you’re as good as he is, you kind of get some bounces like that.”
With two assists on the game, Kerfoot now has 23 helpers on the season—good for fifth in the country. Meanwhile, Vesey now has 17 goals and 34 points in 21 games.
“He’s a pretty special player,” Kerfoot said. “In my opinion, he’s the best player in the country. When you get him in one-on-one with the goalie, he’s going to score most of the time.”
Vesey did come up short on a second breakout opportunity with 1:28 remaining, as Ernst stoned the co-captain, who aimed for the same right corner. That would be the last of Ernst's 30 saves on the night, as Brown could not muster another equalizer, allowing the Crimson to hold on for its ninth ECAC win.
Now 7-0-1 in Ivy League play, Harvard will have a chance to secure its first Ancient Eight crown in 10 years tomorrow night against Yale at Ingalls Rink, where the Crimson has not won a regular season game since January 2005.
“It’s something we talked about at the beginning of the year wanting to do,” Criscuolo said. “It’s super important to our team, so we’re excited for the opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Playing without star forward Zena Edosomwan, the Harvard men’s basketball team dropped to 1-4 in Ivy League play with an 83-62 loss to Princeton at Jadwin Gymnasium. The Crimson (9-12) has now lost four straight conference games, with Friday’s defeat being the program’s worst since an 86-50 loss to Cornell in 2010. The Tigers (13-5, 3-1 Ivy) held a 16-point halftime lead and closed the game on a 33-22 run after Harvard cut the deficit to 10.
MISSING ZENA
With Edosomwan sidelined indefinitely due to a thigh injury, the Crimson struggled to find its rhythm on both ends of the floor. The void from missing the junior, who leads the team in points and rebounds and ranks second in blocks, was evident from the opening tip, as Princeton jumped out to a 35-16 lead at the under-four minute media timeout. During that stretch, the Tigers held a 15-10 advantage in the rebounding department and corralled seven offensive boards.
“Well not having Zena is, as we know, he’s averaging a double-double,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s a presence on both ends of the floor, the interior presence is what I mean. [We’re able] to throw it in to him, as we always do on the offensive end. Then he’s an enforcer kind of player for us on the other end, he’s the best defensive rebounder.”
The hole left by Edosomwan’s absence may have been most evident on the defensive end. In the first half, Princeton exposed the Harvard defense with backdoor cuts and easy layups for 16 points in the paint and 13 second chance tallies.
To compensate for its lack of an inside presence, the Crimson switched to a zone defense for much of the second half. After the Tigers began the half shooting two-of-eight from long range, the Princeton shooters began clicking—connecting on their next four attempts to stymie a Harvard run and put the game away for good.
“It's just like defense, getting stops, that's the most important thing,” senior forward Agunwa Okolie said. “Then everything else will take care of itself. That's the only way you can get back in games and we dug ourselves in a hole obviously, and we were just playing catchup the whole time.”
Sophomore forward Chris Egi started in place of Edosomwan and finished the contest with three points and four rebounds in 21 minutes. Forwards Evan Cummins, Weisner Perez, and Balsa Dragovic split the the remaining minutes in the Harvard frontcourt but combined for just seven points. Cummins did not play in the second half due to an illness.
FRESHMAN POISE
On a night in which its frontcourt struggled to get good looks against the Tigers’ defense, the Crimson was led on the offensive end by freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy. The freshman typically gets in rhythm offensively through an inside-out game with Edosomwan, but had to create more shots for himself with his favorite target in street clothes on the bench.
“Zena is a huge part of our team,” McCarthy said. “We like to kind of play through him. Not having him was tough, especially on the rebounding front. But we definitely had to rely on guys like me and the other guards to rebound and we didn’t do a great job of that, especially myself.”
McCarthy was up to the challenge. He finished the contest with 16 points, tying a career high, to lead Harvard. The Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. native was four-for-six from three-point range on a night in which the Crimson shot 63.6 percent from beyond the arc. While classmate Corey Johnson and junior backup point guard Corbin Miller struggled to get in sync on the offensive end, McCarthy’s hot shooting allowed Harvard to make a run at Princeton in the second half as Harvard eventually drew to within 10 with 13 minutes to go.
“I thought he was pretty darn good,” Amaker said. “I thought he was creative, he attacked off the dribble and it was nice to see that. He made some three-point shots and I thought he did a pretty decent job offensively. I was pleased with his production of scoring the ball and trying to make plays for himself and his teammates.”
In his last three conference games, McCarthy’s play on the offensive end has improved. In those three losses, the freshman has averaged 12 points and 4.7 assists and after struggling with turnovers earlier in the season, McCarthy committed just three on Friday.

After yesterday's dusting of snow, we at Flyby have embraced the return of Boston winters. Even if it was 60 degrees on Thursday. That was pretty nice, too.
But for now, campus is a beautiful winter wonderland. So when is the snowball fight?
With the snow that fell yesterday, and the impending snow next week, the conditions will be just perfect for a epic, snowy battle. Next Saturday, before Boston Common plays host to couples for Valentine’s Day (fingers crossed that Datamatch works out for us), students from colleges and universities all over the Boston area will gather for what promises to be an epic snowball fight.
Help your fellow Harvard students battle it out with almost 3,000 (and counting) others and take down MIT, BC, BU, Northeastern, and the seemingly hundreds of other schools in the Greater Boston area. Whether it’s making a snow fort or pummeling enemies with snowballs (while hiding behind the snow fort of course), or going out into the fray and taking some rival students out, it's sure to be a fun way to spend your day.
Though the Facebook event says to “play nice and be respectful :)”, we all know all is fair in love and war and snowball fights. So go ahead, defend Harvard's honor. Game on.
