Elif Şafak's most recent novel, "The Architect's Apprentice", is a vivid account of the work of famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan that stumbles occasionally in its attempt to do more than paint a picture. Unlike some of Şafak's previous work, "The Architect's Apprentice" is less a social commentary and more a straight story, detailing the life of a young boy, Jahan, as he learns to make his way in the palace, first as an elephant tamer and then as an architect under Sinan's instruction. Şafak's attention to detail is impeccable, and her cast and setting positively leap off of the page. However, the actual plot suffers from pages-long doldrums and poor pacing, and the passage of time is not always reflected believably on her characters, making the middling pages of the book tedious at times.
Where Şafak succeeds is in her realistic and engaging depiction of old Istanbul. Jahan arrives in the city by boat at the age of 12, fleeing from his abusive stepfather. Here he bonds and feuds with the other members of the palace, falls desperately in love with the princess, and becomes apprenticed to the Chief Royal Architect, Master Sinan. Şafak fills the halls of the palace and streets of the city with vibrant characters, from an enigmatic gypsy king who befriends Jahan to the shrewd nursemaid who cares for the princess. But this is also the greatest shortcoming of the book: many of the characters feel as if they are there simply as colorful backdrops that do not invite emotional investment and take too much of the novel to begin developing into fully-fledged people.
The book suffers from serious issues with pacing and development. The story takes place across over 90 years of Jahan's life, and the plot does not truly become interesting until the last handful of admittedly gripping pages. Sinan and his apprentices design and construct building after building for sultan after sultan, with a mysterious threat of a saboteur looming just a little too far off page to be interesting. Some stories, such as Jahan's struggle with a villainous blackmailing captain, are simply dropped by the wayside without any satisfying conflict or resolution.
Jahan himself spends most of the book feeling like he is still a little boy at the age of 12, even when he is meant to be in the middle years of his life. Mentions of his age come as a bit of a shock because the passage of time is often only subtly implied but not directly stated. As a result, the identity of “Jahan” conveyed by the novel and the “Jahan” which the novel presents on the page may seem at odds. His work as an architect often seems forced, as his training and skill are implied but never shown. The story of his relationship with the princess is familiar, if not quite believable, because it is again only implied that there is indeed a relationship there and no real account is given of its genesis. Generally the novel and character arcs are not difficult to follow, as the book progresses mostly as one would assume. But they never quite feel real enough, which belies the rock-solid foundation of the setting.
Jahan’s struggles are, however, well-highlighted by his relationship with his elephant, Chota, in whom he finds the warmth and companionship lacking in other humans. Observing Chota, Jahan “could not help but think if human beings could only live more like animals...this world would be a more peaceful place, and perhaps a happier one.” Interestingly enough, Chota is one of the novel’s most engaging characters. The bond that he shares with Jahan feels quite familiar and very boy-and-his-dog. When Jahan is forced to march Chota to war and struggles with his revulsion at his best friend’s discovered bloodlust or the two find comfort in each other's company after a particularly difficult turn of events, "The Architect's Apprentice" is at its most poignant and beautiful.
The book is also commendable for its powerful thematic treatment of how construction relates to destruction, in both buildings and in life. Through Master Sinan, Jahan learns that hate, jealousy, and pride will destroy, but love for God and for each other can create wonders. “Destroying a bridge was easier than building it,” Jahan reflects, watching his master. The same holds true for reputation. Sultans and viziers rise and fall around Jahan at a dizzy pace. Years of maneuvering for power can be stripped away by a single mistake rooted in selfishness and greed, a reality that looms deadly over Jahan in the book's stunning finale.
"The Architect's Apprentice" is a carefully researched window into an ancient and fascinating world decorated with incredible care and filled with quirky, interesting characters. The fast-paced finale eases the frustration and repetition often found within the middle chapters, but it remains that several hundred pages of the book are distinctly unremarkable. The themes are obvious and immense, but do not beget much discussion. For these reasons, "The Architect's Apprentice" is a pleasure to read, but not a novel that stays with one for long.

Though some would struggle to cohesively intertwine the lives of a retired ex-marine accidental-murderer, a middle-aged horse-shoeing anarchist, and a mentally-ill mountain-man-less-accidental-murderer, prolific author T.C. Boyle successfully uses such diverse characters to craft a tale that is both exciting and thought-provoking in his new novel, "The Harder They Come". An outrageous testament to Boyle’s artistic prowess, "The Harder They Come" operates on multiple levels that make it appealing. Its fast-moving plot and intriguing cast of misfit characters may appeal to those more interested in a surface-level perusal, but for ones committed to exploring it further, the novel’s deeper themes are both poignant and accessible. Boyle’s characteristic dark sarcasm drips from every word in a way that creates ripples just intentional enough to disturb any internalized seventh-grade-history perception of the American ideal without splashing deep enough to prompt skeptics to dismiss his ironic commentary.
Self-proclaimed “sovereign citizen” Sara Jennings refuses to wear her seatbelt as an act of defiance, and the brief incarceration it leads to reveals that for this arresting tale, there are no seatbelts allowed. On the macro level, "The Harder They Come" insightfully examines the changing face of American social reality. It encourages indulgement in enjoyment of its initial violence, and then forces the enjoyers to ponder why they—and by extension, Americans as a whole—so wickedly enjoy its portrayal. Its success in achieving this goal stems partially from the lens through which it examines these themes: namely the protagonists, Sten, Adam, and Sara. Their voices subtly scream for salvation in a battle to maintain their identity in a political, cultural, and physical environment that even their force-of-nature personas can’t quite muscle into submission. Is Sten a heroic retiree or a contemptuous killer? Is Adam a principal’s son in the school where Sara used to substitute teach, or his adopted alter-ego, a companion of Lewis and Clark Colter? It is the subjects of such discussions that wrestle with these questions the most—whether they express this doubt on the page or not.
Boyle tantalizingly refuses to provide direct answers to such existential-crisis-provoking introspections. Although most cannot specifically relate to the mental-health struggles of Adam and Sara, the genius of "The Harder They Come" once again reappears in its ability to serve poignant storylines that address more universal topics like freedom and exploration. Sara’s defiant statement that “you did what you did and you couldn’t have regrets, not in this life that just marched you on toward the grave day by day” could have been lifted straight from the diary of a darkly eloquent and reflective middle-school girl but feels equally at home in the mouth of a dissatisfied, lucidly-delusional adult. Upon his first visit to Sara’s house, Adam listens to her speak and describes her voice as sounding “like a ventriloquist with a dummy in her lap and who was the dummy here, who was the receiver, what was the message?” The ambiguity present in this sentence may prompt a pause of self-conscious melancholy on the part of readers.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, Boyle announced, “I want to get inside the head of every creature in the world.” Though he confines his exploration in "The Harder They Come" to beasts of the Homo sapiens variety, the psyches of the specimens he selects occupy a wide enough range of emotional and temporal states that they, at times, cease to resemble the mold of humanity to which so many literary characters are confined. His fresh characters imbue the novel with a powerful sense of life despite several deaths throughout the course of the narrative. This contrast is intensified by Boyle’s unusual word choices. Those unfamiliar with Local H’s 1996 hit “Bound For the Floor,” for instance, might have to crack a dictionary for words such as “copacetic”—right after listening to the song and reevaluating their taste in ’90s angsty pop-culture, of course. Additionally satisfying is Boyle’s alternation between half-page-long stream-of-consciousness sentences and the three-word fragments that stave off comprehensional fatigue. The novel’s fast pace and sharp wit, combined with its unapologetically odd protagonists, raise questions of whether Boyle was consuming copious amounts of caffeine or something as psychedelic as the contents of Adam’s garden. Whatever his trick is, other contemporary authors would benefit greatly from following suit.
Although on the whole it is aggressively unique, Boyle’s writing style at times is reminiscent of various older literary masters, especially in his use of in medias res. The only potentially off-putting instance of this appears when Boyle dedicates over 60 pages to the initial plotline of Sten’s Costa Rican vacation-turned-manslaughter and then jarringly switches locations and narrator to first Sara and then Adam, both of whose connection to this episode is, at a cursory glance, tentative at best. While the action of the novel’s beginning feels epic and sets the tone for the rest of the novel, its abandonment of this anecdote feels anti-climactic—at least until the next round of action commences. The influence of the only writer Boyle once said he would like to invite to a dinner party, Ernest Hemingway, is evident as well in Adam’s glorification of simple, traditionally-masculine outdoors tasks and the inclusion of sentences whose simple phrasing belies their incisive, between-the-lines commentary.
In the book’s epigraph, Boyle quotes D.H. Lawrence, saying,  “The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer. It has never yet melted.”  Boyle’s artistic soul is incontrovertibly American in its rugged poise, and as phenomenal as the scientific curiosity “sodium acetate.” Boyle’s essence is like this “hot ice”: hopefully it will never melt. A writer who can make ugly topics and imagery beautiful—a dead man is not a corpse but “an exhausted dance partner”—and violence eerily pleasurable, Boyle once again proves his literary merit in the remarkable tale “The Harder They Come."

The question of whether older people can navigate the social media-and-iPhone-heavy world of today's young adults often surfaces in news stories, classrooms, and daily conversations. Noah Baumbach's new film, "While We're Young” grapples poignantly with that question. The film, which centers around the relationships of two couples from different generations, focuses on the disconnect between aging and struggling to fit in and stay relevant.
The premises are deeply resonant with modern life. Documentarian Josh (Ben Stiller) and producer Cornelia (Naomi Watts) are happily married fortysomethings living in New York City. While they seem to be in a rut—Josh has been developing the same intellectual film for 10 years, and Cornelia works for her famous filmmaker father, Leslie (Charles Grodin)—their life works for them. They do not have kids, although they have tried several times, but they tell themselves that they are fine without any children, even as their couple-friends become parents and seem to have their life plans figured out. Yet remarks that “you should be parents” and “you would make great parents” not only make Josh and Cornelia visibly uncomfortable but shake up how they see themselves and their life trajectory.
When aspiring filmmaker Jamie (Adam Driver) and his wife Darby (Amanda Seyfried)—the younger couple in the film—enter the scene, the child-sized hole in Josh and Cornelia’s life is filled with this pair of caricaturish, hipster 25-year-olds. In their vintage Bushwick loft, Jamie and Darby prefer vinyl records to illegal downloads, homemade avocado ice cream to takeout, and board games to television, while Josh and Cornelia can’t seem to put their iPhones away. “It used to be [rude], but now it’s accepted,” one adult remarks during a dinner scene in which all four middle-aged guests are on their phones. In these moments, Baumbach successfully inverts the technology-obsessed youth stereotype. Even if his allusions are incessant, they’re downright funny.
Take, for example, a montage scene in which Cornelia attends a hip-hop class with Darby, and Josh and Jamie buy fedoras and ride their retro bicycles through the city’s streets. Once the music starts, Cornelia cannot figure out the moves—“What kind of class is this?” she frantically asks Darby—and, crippled with arthritis in his knees, Josh lags behind Jamie on the bikes until he can’t ride anymore and has to walk his bike onto the sidewalk. Still, Cornelia and Josh want everything that Darby and Jamie appear to have: the carefree attitudes, the fun, the vibrancy that seems to come with youth and possibility. Much to the chagrin of their same-aged friends, Cornelia and Josh eschew weekend trips and brunches to spend time with Darby and Jamie.
Indeed, the actors in “While We’re Young” have the authenticity of their characters down pat. Josh and Cornelia’s marriage feels like a story from The New York Times’ “Modern Love Column.” They seem to ask, “Despite our age and the example set by our couple-friends, how do we spice up our life, keep our relationship current, and still figure out what we’re doing?” Driver—the film world’s go-to hipster—and Seyfried, for their parts, play their roles unironically, especially when Jamie’s ambitions and lack of generosity persist and Darby has to decide how not to live in his shadow. Baumbach says that growing up with films like “Tootsie” and “Working Girl” influenced the “While We’re Young” script, through which he hopes to channel how those films focused primarily on people.
Ultimately, then, “While We’re Young” is a portrait about the characters as they find their place—accepting that place and what is missing—and move forward accordingly. As Josh and Cornelia navigate life’s twists and turns, both good and bad, they must grow up, adjust, and make the best of it—and, in their way, Darby and Jamie must also grow up and learn what it means to age. Their life and the decisions they make, played out in  “While We’re Young,” remind audience members to laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It recently occurred to me that I had not learned something without intending to in a while.
I read an amount of stuff that at the very least is, in size, non-trivial. It's good stuff, real stuff in the sense of stuff—intellectual furnishing. But I'd gone to class or the web to get it, syllabi to find it. I know what I'm getting into when I get the stuff, and it's not as if I don't want the “History of the Peloponnesian War” stuffed between two folds in my cortical living room, but I put it there on purpose. For what purpose? Enrichment? Self-empowerment? It's unclear, but in a way irrelevant. That's not the point. The point is, that like a stack of coffee table books including “Venuses of the Uffizi” and “Armenian Folk Dance Through the Ages” prominently displayed on a knotty table in the center of a den, it's not there by accident, but it might as well be.
Since reading Mandy Len Catron’s syrupy, if insightful, article highlighting why and how we might benefit from conceiving the process of “falling” in love as a deliberate, as opposed to unwitting, act, I've been thinking about how flipping my notions of activity and passivity may affect the important things in my life—especially concerning the process of learning.
My instinct is to regard learning as intensely active. I’m unconvinced by the collegiate trope that a substantial minority of my learning occurs during dining hall conversations, uninformed section dialogue, or mandatory fun sessions. And I wonder if even my tastes and values are not just the necessary results of my consciously spending time thinking about things or practicing things or doing things. I get stuff by doing things, not by things having been done.
I want the stuff of learning, so I buy it with my attention and time. I consider the purposefulness of knowledge stuff before I acquire it, but even that's not the important bit. That process lies in a domain like that of cover letters and course evaluations: It's necessary but often superficial, people will always make it out to be more important than it really is, and it doesn't especially help my understanding of why “doing” learning may be better or worse than its passive reflection.
When I think about what I might have learned without thinking—or why that might be what I want to start doing without doing—I'm inexorably drawn to storytelling.
One cannot actively learn stories that matter, yet somehow they can still be learned. Sure, I can pursue opportunity, and I can develop favorable expectations for something interesting to happen, but that's not how real stories work. That's how tourism works. That's how factoid vomit works. The stories that matter are not those that are purchased, but those that simply happen and happen to stick.
The wizened have stories. We anthropomorphize gnarled trees, copper clay roads, and marble halls as storied, because stories have happened to them, and, if we plead, they may tell them to us.
Great men and women have stories. Fathers and mothers console with them, villains strike fear with them. Spielberg’s Lincoln calms and forces thoughtfulness onto others with them. Sojourner Truth, a woman who like no other had the “subtle power which we call personal presence” according to Harriet Beecher Stowe, told her own sacerdotal tales inspired by experiences with Christ that presented themselves to her. And even when reciting traditional hymns, they “seemed to be fused in the furnace of her feelings and come out recrystallized as a production of her own”.
Not all of us have the pleasure of eternal life through posterity or of having revelation thrust upon us. But the stories are still there, looking for minds to settle in.
The experiences that help carve stories are like Machiavelli's fortune. They may ask of us to be impetuous and open to new circumstances; we can seduce them and work with them, and perhaps we will be taught something. But a blind belief that, if only we try, we can fully understand their ways and make them bend for us by simply accumulating enough knowledge stuff, will keep us unstoried. One must orient himself to fortune without thinking that he can make it his slave. We do what we can deliberately, and the rest we learn to live with.
The moral of this story is not to “just” slow down or to “live your life”  as we are so often patronized by mildly pressured dilettantes and the autoerotic restoring-your-faith-in-humanity meme ocean. Complacency kills, and a life with too much of it will leave you like the dehydrated pulp forced out an industrial juicer with teeth like the Breath of God.
But the choice of passivity is not one of complacency—it is one of vigilance without action. Stories may not be sought out, but they have a knack of not happening upon the lazy.
I don't have many stories yet, and I think it's my fault. So now, I'm going to keep my peripheral vision on high alert, my ears pricked up, and try to start learning without learning.

To say that the American Civil War continues to exercise an immense influence on the United States seems obvious, but it always pays to revisit why obvious statements are so.
The war’s legacy is everywhere: We still debate whether it is appropriate to display the Confederacy’s battle flag, or, closer to home, whether we should commemorate Harvard students who died fighting under it. Race still dominates national discussions, and we still argue about which rights of citizenship apply to which people, the best way to guarantee those rights, and what the federal government may do—all questions that animated America’s bloodiest conflict.
The practical importance of the Civil War is also beyond question. Imagine a world in which slavery had continued until 1900 or later, or in which you needed a passport to travel from Boston to Atlanta. These counterfactuals might seem farfetched, but they were absolutely the issues at stake between 1861 and 1865, when the unity of the supposedly well-founded American constitutional system was held together only through the annihilation of two percent of the nation’s population. As President Drew Faust’s book on the subject shows, that kind of slaughter has a lasting effect on a people.
Next Thursday, April 9th, is the 150th anniversary of Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. Five days later is the sesquicentennial of Lincoln’s assassination at Ford’s Theatre.
These anniversaries of the war’s end underscore how close these events are to our own time. A five-year-old boy in Ford’s Theater for Lincoln’s assassination lived to recount the experience on television in the 1950s. The formative years of many 20th century Americans like Woodrow Wilson, who instituted segregation in the federal government, occurred during the war. The fourteenth amendment, on which we still rely for government civil rights action, the first Ku Klux Klan that provided the inspiration for later manifestations of American racism, the voting rights gained at Selma and under threat again today, are all direct descendants of the Civil War.
These aspects of the war are relatively well known. Others are less so, but no less important. Internationally, France’s invasion of Mexico in 1862 might very well have led to Napoleon III offering direct support for the Confederacy if not for careful U.S. diplomacy, and Britain also almost aided the South. The war’s implications for Native Americans, too, are often overlooked: Some slave-holding tribes fought with the Confederacy, while in the plains, conflicts like the Dakota War continued through the war. Union officers like George Custer later became infamous for their role fighting Native Americans in the West.
The issue of slavery transcends all. Reading South Carolina’s Ordinance of Secession quickly dispels the idea that slavery was anything but the war’s central and overriding issue. The states of the Confederacy wished to preserve their system of labor based on the enslavement of African-Americans, they believed that system to be under threat, and so they left the Union. Like all history, the exact contours of those events are complex and non-linear, but the outline is clear.
The North is hardly blameless in this story. It profited from industries and commercial connections that relied on slavery. Harvard itself bears the evidence of this history, as students in History professor Sven Beckert’s “Harvard and Slavery” class have uncovered. From money donated in Harvard’s early years, to the original owner of the President’s house, to antebellum Southern slave-holding students, Harvard’s history and that of the United States’ original sin are closely intertwined.
Over the next few weeks, take a minute to consider the reminders of the Civil War we encounter in our daily lives. Go to one of the Holden Choruses’ concerts on the war. (Full disclosure: I sing in the Harvard Glee Club). When eating in Annenberg or going to class in Sanders, read the names of the Harvard men killed fighting for the United States—and remember that some of their peers died fighting, however misguidedly, for the cause of secession. When walking across Cambridge Common, notice that the tallest memorial is to the Civil War. Remember that the first African-American field officer in the U.S. Army was kicked out of Harvard Medical School for being black. And consider that some of Harvard’s oldest buildings were built with money from slavery and the slave trade.
A few months ago, I ended a column by quoting the Gettysburg Address, and Lincoln seems a good place to end this column as well. Lincoln underwent an immense personal evolution during the war—one that ultimately revolved around the questions of citizenship, race, and nationhood that are the Civil War’s most salient legacies. Indeed, Lincoln’s final speech, on April 11, 1865, directly addressed those issues. But his second inaugural address articulated perhaps the definitive challenge the Civil War created for him and for the nation: “let us strive on to finish the work we are in…to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.”
Achieving that “just and lasting peace” has proven to be the work of generations. As Civil War anniversaries approach, our responsibility is to remember those who carried on that work before us, and to carry it on ourselves.

It's going to be that time soon.
Rumors abound. Sometimes you are given a key to a secret door, or asked to sign a book based on political affiliation, or blindfolded.
Sometimes the rumors are worse: You don’t sleep for a week and you’re forced to wear stupid clothing. Or you serve older members at events. Or you ridicule yourself and each other.
And worse still: Who has burned a dollar bill in front of a homeless person? Who has pretended to hawk Spare Change News? Who was concussed and prevented from going to the hospital? Who has been sexually assaulted?
I’m talking about initiations. Here’s how they work. All semester, we go through a comp, or a punch, or a rush—a process of competition, selection, and training for one of many exclusive organizations on campus. Sometimes, these processes are educational and fun. Sometimes, they entail a certain level of dickishness, calculated to make applicants feel small. But almost unanimously, these processes rely on hierarchical divisions between members and compers, inside and out.
If and when we get on, we are initiated, and the hierarchy is leveled. During a climactic evening or day or week—often chemically-altered, often somewhat mysterious—we participate in rituals of belonging. Sometimes these rituals are silly and fun: We go on scavenger hunts and dance to Beyoncé.
Sometimes, shit gets weirder.
The line between initiation and hazing is pretty, well, hazy. Massachusetts state law defines hazing as any activity that  “willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person.”
Think now of your organization’s practices. Maybe they fit the definition of hazing. Maybe they don’t. Maybe you have some nagging doubts.
I have some nagging doubts, too.
Don’t get me wrong: When I was comping, I was all about initiations. I craved the dark room, the booze, the weird sexual questions. I woke up the next morning, and I belonged.
In a social scene that can so often be exclusionary, that’s an incredible feeling.
But belonging predicated on hierarchy, belonging at the cost of our dignity, at the cost of our self-respect and our respect for other people, at the cost of our comfort and our safety—that’s not belonging at all.
“It’s about creating an alternative imaginative space,” a friend of mine said one night as we talked about initiations. “You imagine this other world together, and it bonds you.”
This makes sense to me, and is potentially pretty cool.
Think of friends with whom you’ve had a weekend-long sleepover, with whom you’ve gone on a road trip, or participated in a workshop, or talked all night. The normal social rules are slightly altered by a period of openness and intimacy. That really can build love.
At their very best this is what initiations can be: Spaces where the normal rigidity of Harvard social life breaks down. Spaces to experiment, to open up to each other in new ways, to be vulnerable, to be weird.
But this is only accomplished with incredible conscientiousness. Because we do things in groups, and in secret, that we wouldn’t otherwise do. And the promise of belonging is such a heady reward, even when initiation activities are “optional,” it can be hard to say no.
There’s another belief that underlies hazing, the darker side of initiations. We haze, a friend of mine said, because “hardship creates community.”
This is just flat-out wrong.
Here’s the thing about hardship: It’s hard. I don’t mean “boohoo, I’m a millennial who grew up getting trophies for participation and I don’t want to be challenged.”
I mean that the world is already brimming with hardship. There is hardship happening right here, right now.
And frankly, hardship sucks. I made some of my best friends during periods of hardship. I was also a boring, sniveling, traumatized mess. And a lot of my relationships suffered, or ended.
Hardship doesn’t happen because someone decides to impose it upon us for our personal growth. Hardship, genuine hardship, is arbitrary, and often structural, and gives no shits about our personal growth.
Hardship tears us down.
For a lot of us, Harvard itself is a four-year hazing process. For students who have to learn alien class norms. For students who feel like they’re leaving their families and communities behind. For students struggling with depression, with racism, with intimate partner violence. And in the hazing process that is Harvard—in the hazing process that is life—the stakes are very, very high.
When people drop out of this hazing process, we don’t always get them back.
If we’re forced to choose between feeling like we belong and respecting the dignity of ourselves and others, then I say: Fuck belonging.
But we don’t have to choose.
Transformative, creative experiences of intimacy and community can coexist with physical and mental respect. In fact, it’s only when they coexist that we make our communities strong.
This semester, think hard about your initiations. Do you ask people to do compromising or humiliating things? Do you pressure people to ingest alcohol or drugs? Do you sexualize people who are less powerful than you? Are your activities truly optional? Does everyone feel empowered when they say yes, and safe when they say no?
I want to belong.
But I don’t want to belong at the expense of other people. I don’t want to belong at the expense of myself.
I want to feel that thing I feel at a party about three drinks in, when every face is the face of someone who loves me, and every friend wants to make out. I want to feel that thing when my heart expands to squish my ribcage and every stupid Top-40 song sounds like senior prom.
I want to exist in that wild, wonderful space of collective imagination. And I want to know that my community will bring me safely home.

Religious freedom is paramount in the United States of America; it is enshrined in the First Amendment and protected by both a federal law and individual laws in 20 states as of this week. Recent legislation passed in Indiana, ostensibly intended to protect religious freedom, goes far beyond that point, allowing discrimination against LGBT individuals in the name of religion. While we support Indiana’s right to pass a religious objections law, this is not what it should look like.
Whereas the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the 19 other individual state versions apply to cases brought by individuals against the government itself, Indiana’s RFRA explicitly defines “person” to include businesses and does not require the government to be a party in the case. Indiana is the only state whose RFRA emphasizes both of these points. The intent of the law is clear: To allow business owners to refuse service to LGBT individuals by claiming that their “exercise of religion has been substantially burdened.” Even in Texas, where the RFRA is most similar to the Indiana version, the law is explicitly worded to preclude its use as a defense in a civil rights case—a clarification that is nowhere to be found in Indiana’s new law. If the true purpose of the law were to protect religious freedom, the law would have mirrored the versions passed in other states.
We find it difficult to believe that this bill was conceived and worded so precisely with the innocent intentions that Indiana Governor Michael R. Pence has claimed. In fact, a group called Advance America lobbied in favor of the law by explicitly arguing that it could help businesses “[refuse] to participate in a homosexual marriage.” Though Governor Pence has promised to fix the bill, it should never have reached this stage; this is emphasized by the history of past RFRAs. Last year, Arizona’s Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that was a model for Indiana’s RFRA. Similarly, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, also a Republican, has asked his legislature to make changes to a similar bill recently passed in his state before he signs it.
This is neither a partisan issue nor a religious liberty issue; it is a civil rights issue. It is clear that the Indiana law is inherently and deliberately discriminatory. Governor Pence has also stated that he will not pursue a civil rights bill extending protections to gays in Indiana. Allowing personal discrimination in the name of religious freedom benefits no one.
The ultimate solution is simple: A federal civil rights law that extends legal protection from discrimination to LGBT individuals should be passed by the federal government without delay. If individual states—such as Indiana—cannot be counted on to defend civil rights, the federal government must step in to do so. Such a federal law would preclude state RFRAs, like Indiana's, from being used in ways that allow discrimination; it would also offer a clearer legal recourse to LGBT individuals who have been discriminated against. In the short term, an immediate fix is desperately needed to Indiana’s religious freedom law; looking forward, federal action is necessary to prevent similar laws from being passed or enforced in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana taught a master class on identity politics and the danger of assumptions at the Graduate School of Education this Thursday.
The class, which featured multiple case studies taught by Khurana and closed with a conversation between Khurana and Ed School Professor Howard E. Gardner ’65, was entitled “Know Thyself: Can the Case Method Help Understand Oneself?"
Engaging with audience members in an open discussion, Khurana focused on three Harvard Business School cases on “Differences at Work.” He emphasized the need for students to balance advocacy and inquiry in discussing controversial topics.
“The approach that most people take isn’t ‘let me try to understand what’s going on here,’ it’s ‘let me assume what’s going on and advocate for the position,’” Khurana said. “We’re trying to make our students understand what their reflexes are in emotionally intense situations.”
Khurana explained that while advocacy is a one-way communication and thought process, inquiry can be a more open, two-way method for gathering information. He illustrated his points by interacting with attendees through role play and the use of a gender-ambiguous name, which drew attention to implicit assumptions made in the work place.
Referencing the Ed School’s year-long theme of “Fulfilling the Promise of Diversity,” Khurana demonstrated how classroom discussions involving individuals with unique identities and backgrounds offer an opportunity to identify and address assumptions and generalizations.
“What we’re often trying to do is de-program our students from all of the kinds of cultural and social categories and theories, which are very relevant, but to show how in the particular, you may be making very wrong inferences and judgments of situations,” Khurana said. “And we particularly find this to be very powerful when we do this around social identity, gender, [and] race differences.”
Khurana also spoke about his own teaching philosophy and the importance of challenging students as they dissect cases. Otherwise “everybody walks away smiling, and no one walks away with their minds changed,” he said.
Monica C. Higgins, a professor at the Ed School who was at the event, said that she thinks other attendees will depart having both seen “a masterful teacher” and gained an understanding of how to teach difficult topics about identity.
“He’s a wonderful, authentic, caring, thoughtful professor, and I think that was demonstrated in how he led the discussion,” Higgins said.

The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter’s Youth Housing Initiative, which has been working to launch a youth homeless shelter in Harvard Square, has secured a space for the shelter at First Parish in Cambridge.
Executive directors of the Youth Housing Initiative Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 first proposed the idea for the youth homeless shelter to First Parish’s senior minister, Reverend Fred Small, more than a year ago. After working out logistics and considering financial impacts, the congregation voted 65-2 in favor of housing the shelter in the parish this past Sunday, according to Small.
“I think from the beginning there was tremendous eagerness to make this work because we felt that there was a clear need for the service that would be provided,” Small said.
The youth homeless shelter will be located in the basement auditorium of the church, according to a post on Small’s Facebook page. The shelter will operate alongside Youth on Fire, an LGBTQ-friendly drop-in center for homeless youth, to provide services for homeless youth ages 14 to 24 seven days a week. The overnight program will be available to youth 18 to 24, according to Small.
“The congregation seemed extremely excited, and that’s very uplifting considering how important this shelter is,” said Phillips Brooks House Association president Ceylon Auguste-Nelson ’16, who has been working with the rest of PBHA to help support the formation of the shelter. “We’ve been thinking about how the space is going to look, so it’s wonderful to see we really have people behind it.”
Although the project was a financial stretch for the parish, according to Small, the congregation decided that the costs would be well worth it.
“It’s a great example of what we want our program to do: a program being created to not just address the day-to-day needs and issues of youth homeless and LGBTQ homeless,” Auguste-Nelson said, “but the idea is that it will help a larger structural issue of homelessness and further the advocacy for that.”
Greenberg declined to comment on the shelter until an official launch event on April 13.

Table cloths draping dining hall tables, sparkling silverware, and students decked out in spiffy attire all indicate that the semesterly series of Faculty Dinners is well underway at Harvard College. The dinners are a longstanding tradition at Harvard, appreciated by faculty and students alike.
“I love faculty dinners—a wonderful institution,” said Andrew Berry, a lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology
Pforzheimer, Mather, Adams, and Cabot Houses have already held their faculty dinners. The remaining Houses will continue hosting their faculty dinners on various days through the coming weeks.
Attendees praised the timing of faculty dinners, which are often scheduled near the middle of the semester.
“It makes no sense to have them too early in the term when students don’t yet know the instructors in their courses, and at the end of the term, students have other obligations piling up,” said professor of political economy Benjamin M. Friedman '66.
Friedman encouraged multiple students to jointly invite a professor, adding that the group dynamic not only leads to enjoyable conversations, but also facilitates student interaction with classmates outside of their established circles.
For their part, students noted that inviting a faculty member can be stressful and may even require preparation the evening before.
“I find professors to be very intimidating in general,” said Nicholas F. Bobbs ’16. “I’ll probably have to read a bunch of articles before the dinner so I don’t sound stupid.”
While faculty dinners are consistently well-attended, some professors note that there may still be room for improvement.
“As a Brit, I see a companionable drink as one of the cornerstones of civilization. Some Houses, however, provide only non-alcoholic beverages,” said Berry. “ My only suggestion then, for improvement, is that those Houses that do not serve alcohol at their faculty dinners change their policy.”

Kimberly Theidon, a former Harvard professor who  in March filed a lawsuit against Harvard for denying her tenure, has received tenure at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of International Affairs and will begin teaching there in the fall. Her appointment begins July 1.
Theidon, who was an associate anthropology professor at Harvard, will teach courses about human security at the Tufts graduate school as their Henry J. Leir Professor of International Humanitarian Studies when she begins teaching in September. For the past year, she has held the position of associate research professor at the Fletcher School, also serving as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.
In early March, Theidon filed a lawsuit against Harvard in federal court, alleging that the school’s decision to deny her tenure violated the federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. Prior to taking her case to federal court, Theidon filed a similar complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination roughly a year ago, alleging that she was denied tenure for advocating for victims of sexual assault, in part taking place on the comments section of a Crimson article.
According to Tufts spokesperson Taraneh Pettinato, Theidon applied for the tenure position at Tufts during the school’s spring 2014 search. Her appointment was announced March 23.
“She was the best of a brilliant group of scholars and teachers who applied for a tenured position here focused on human security,” James Stavridis, Dean of Tufts’s Fletcher School, wrote in an email.
At the same time that she was undergoing tenure review at Tufts, Theidon was in the beginning of her legal proceedings against Harvard. In March 2014, Theidon filed the complaint with MCAD, which her lawyer Philip J. Gordon said in a September interview was a procedural requirement necessary to move forward with a lawsuit.
In the subsequent lawsuit filed in March of this year, Theidon specified a number of concerns regarding how her gender allegedly affected her ultimate tenure decision, claiming that she was held to a higher standard than male peers and received “less pay and work space than those accorded to males who had less experience or productivity.”
Further, the lawsuit highlights Theidon’s response to a March 2013 Crimson article about sexual harassment at Harvard. In her comments on the story, Theidon offered a defense of the anonymous sexual assault victims who were quoted in the story.
“I am filing this lawsuit in the hope I embolden others to step forward,” Theidon wrote in an email. “As faculty, we should be our students' best allies in making our campuses safer and more equitable learning environments.”
In a statement, University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote that Theidon’s “central claims that inappropriate judgments affected her tenure decision continue to be flatly wrong.”

The Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting next Wednesday will mark the first time that the advisory body convenes in more than 100 days.
The task force was created in 2006 and is charged by the Boston Redevelopment Authority with liaising between the neighborhood of Allston, the City of Boston, and Harvard. It last met on Dec. 15.
Last year, residents voiced concerns that the task force, though productive, lacked the diversity and transparency necessary to truly represent the neighborhood.
According to a list of official topics on the BRA’s website, the April 8 meeting will focus on the continued implementation of Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston and the associated community benefits package. Topics will include community benefits such as the housing fund, the construction of Rena Park, and the demolition of the building on the Brookline Machine site.
The task force had met at least twice each month prior to last December, said task force member John A. Bruno. While he and the other volunteer members welcomed the break, Bruno said he is ready to restart the conversation with the City and the University.
“The months from January to March were just horrible months to have any meetings, and it’s been a really long time since we’ve sat down and discussed issues,” Bruno said.
Brent C. Whelan ’73, another task force member, said he has a hard time predicting the issues that will be discussed, as a result of both the long hiatus since the task force last met and the lack of specificity in the agenda the BRA provides for the meeting.
Whelan expressed disappointment, however, that some large-scale components of Harvard’s development plans, such as the construction of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex, were rarely brought up at past task force meetings.
Bruno said he hopes to hear “some concrete ideas” on the development of the 0.7-acre Brookline Machine site that Harvard gave to Boston as part of its $43 million community benefits package for Allston and wanted to discuss “improved lighting, appropriate signage, and sidewalk improvements.”
When Harvard decided to donate the Brookline Machine site to the city, representatives from the University and the BRA, as well as various task members, supported the idea of building housing on the abandoned warehouse site.
Allston resident Galen Mook also expressed hopes that Harvard would “be a good neighbor” and participate in the community conversation. Mook said he hopes to see “a timeline that Harvard can commit to...and a guarantee that promises to the neighborhood would be kept.”
“Harvard can...use its corridor to reconnect us to the river and restitch Allston back together,” Mook concluded. “If Harvard takes that opportunity, it would be wonderful for everyone. This [meeting] is a step in the right direction to get the conversation going again.”

EdX, an online learning platform that Harvard co-founded with MIT in 2012, entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice on Thursday and will address alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. That settlement could come to bear on a separate but similar lawsuit against Harvard that revolves around issues of accessibility online.
Namely, the edX settlement will require the platform to become accessible for people with disabilities—including those who are deaf or visually impaired.
In particular, edX is required to “provide accurate captioning for the deaf, oral navigation signals for the blind, and programming changes so those with dexterity disabilities can navigate content without struggling with a hand-operated mouse,” among other stipulations, according to a Department of Justice press release. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that public accommodations not deny disabled people its services.
“We know that we still have more to do, but we have always been committed to this goal, and we are excited about where we are going,” wrote Tena Herlihy, general counsel for edX, in a post on the edX website.
The settlement comes as the National Association of the Deaf sues Harvard and MIT for allegedly discriminating against the deaf and hard of hearing by not providing online captioning both for the courses they offer through edX and the rest of their online content. The private lawsuit, filed in February, accuses the University of violating both the American with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, which requires that educational institutions that receive federal funding provide equal access to disabled individuals. Legal experts have said that the suits against Harvard and MIT has merit.
While Thursday’s settlement with the federal government is independent from the ongoing private lawsuit, the settlement could still play a role in the litigation, Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law.
“It’s hard to imagine it wouldn’t have some impact on that litigation,” Lake said. He added that it is hard to tell exactly to what extent it will influence the Harvard lawsuit, given the differences between private litigation and settlements with the federal government.
For Bill Lann Lee, one of the lawyers representing the NAD, the settlement validates the NAD’s position.
“I think it’s a clear indication from the Department of Justice, which does have the duty of enforcing the ADA, that it believes online content is subject to the ADA,” he said
In 2012, Harvard and MIT launched edX, which has since grown to include numerous other institutions of higher education from around the world, including Columbia and the University of Hong Kong.

Harvard Business School has named Scott Cook, co-founder and current chairman of the executive committee of Intuit Inc., as its 2015 Class Day speaker.
Cook co-founded Intuit—a $4.5 billion financial software company headquartered in Mountain View, Calif.—after working at Procter & Gamble. Intuit has been ranked in Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” and “America’s Most Admired Software Companies.”
Mike Murphy, associate director of MBA student and academic services at HBS, wrote in an email that speakers are selected based on their “recognition, accessibility, ability to deliver a motivational speech, and take away relevance.”
Murphy added that the selection process begins by polling students to seek guidance on the “qualities students find compelling in their Class Day keynote,” and then the Dean of HBS communicates with leaders in the business world. According to Murphy, the Student Associate Class Committee members work with the speaker to target opportunities for engagement with the students in the weeks prior to Class Day.
According to the announcement, in 1996 Cook received the Alumni Achievement Award from HBS, which acknowledges “graduates who represent the highest standards of professional excellence and integrity.”
A press release states that a committee of second-year MBA students plan the schedule for Class Day. The event is open to graduating students and their guests, as well as HBS alumni, faculty, and staff.
Class Day, scheduled for May 27, honors students graduating from HBS the day before the official Commencement ceremony.

The Cambridge City Council voted 8-1 Monday to pass a “Bring Your Own Bag” ordinance, which bans single-use plastic bags and imposes a fee upon paper bags. Retail establishments that violate the ban will be liable for a fine of up to $300 per day.
Businesses have 180 days before the ordinance goes into effect.
The ban, a version of which was also proposed in 2007, aims to encourage the use of renewable bags. The law makes Cambridge the largest city on the East Coast to impose a ban on single-use plastic bags, Cambridge City Councillor Dennis Carlone said, and follows similar legislation in Brookline and Newton.
Cambridge is also the first municipality in the Commonwealth to charge for paper bags. According to Carlone, the fee will be kept by retailers, and may help to offset the costs associated with switching away from plastic bags.
“As someone said to me, we've got along without plastic [bags] most of creation,” Carlone said. “And we’ll do it again.”
For Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, the ban is an important step in reducing what he argued was a negative environmental impact caused by plastic or paper bags. Carlone echoed Mazen’s concerns, saying that plastic bags toxify soil and are overly wasteful because they are used only once.
“These are bags that end up in rivers in streams and ecosystems,” Mazen said. “They don't biodegrade for a heck of a long time.”
However, Brian Houghton, the vice president of Massachusetts Food Association, wrote to the City Council that the association opposed the ban because it would harm business and disrupt existing recycling efforts.
“The bags themselves are not the problem, but rather what consumers do with them after they are finished using them,” Houghton wrote. He said a solution is needed to address litter rather than bans, which “unfairly disrupt business.”
Mazen emphasized the environmental aspect of the ban, and called on its supporters to step up efforts towards divestment from fossil fuels. The City Council filed a resolution in support of Divest Harvard last June.
“This passage of the ordinance is the first in an important series of steps. Right on the heels of [the ban] is our investment in fossil fuels,” Mazen said. “I want to see people who believe that the plastic bag ban is an important ordinance start to gear up for divestment by our city and universities.”
As stated in the ordinance, exceptions may be obtained for “undue hardships.” Per request, the city manager will also purchase 10,000 reusable bags for seniors and low-income residents.

Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spoke about her experience in international negotiations and interpersonal diplomacy as part of a panel hosted at the Harvard Business School on Thursday.
At the event, she discussed her time as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations as well as her role as the first female Secretary of State, and touched upon her involvement in negotiations in the Balkans, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.
Albright was invited as part of the American Secretaries of State Project, organized by the Belfer Center’s Future of Diplomacy Project and the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. The program, which plans to interview all former Secretaries of State, has previously welcomed former Secretaries George P. Schultz, James A. Baker III, and Henry A. Kissinger.
The event featured a panel discussion between Albright and a trio of Harvard professors—Harvard Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns, HLS professor Robert H. Mnookin and HBS professor James K. Sebenius—who also facilitated an audience question and answer session.
Albright praised listening skills as integral to successful diplomacy. She cited the ability to comprehend the needs of the other side during a negotiation as helpful in determining areas of common interest.
“The basis of any successful negotiation is to understand what the other person needs,” she said.
She also emphasized the importance of building personal relationships several times throughout the event, noting how a personal rapport could help move the diplomatic process along.
“The human relationship makes a big difference,” she said. “You don’t have to like everybody, but you do have to know what makes them tick.”
In addition, Albright spoke about a “toolbox” available for diplomatic action. She named the use of force, law enforcement, intelligence, and economic tools as supplements to bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.
Albright cautioned that purely diplomatic solutions were insufficient. She cited the lack of political will as a major obstacle in resolving issues like the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“It’s so tragic, because we know how to solve this, we really do. I keep going back to the [lack of] political will,” she said.
She also highlighted the unique challenges she faced as the first female to assume the position as the top diplomat for the United States.
“There is an attempt, if the person on the other side is a man, to think that he can charm you, and you’re just a pushover,” Albright said. “I ultimately got to be known as not a pushover.”

Michael Hawkins, a 60-year-old Brighton resident, was arrested and charged with trespassing the middle entryway of Grays Hall on Saturday, according to Harvard University Police logs.
The alleged trespass was reported by Christian J. Floyd ’18, who said he encountered a “mysterious man” standing at the bottom of the stairs on the first floor of Grays Middle entryway Saturday. According to Floyd, the man asked to use his cell phone, and when Floyd refused, the man took it out of his hand and made a call to an unknown number in Milwaukee.
“I got my phone back and asked him what he was doing here, and he didn’t really respond,” Floyd said. “He wasn’t talking well; I couldn’t really understand much of what he said at all.”
Floyd said he left Grays and proceeded to call the Harvard University Police Department while on his way to the Science Center. According to the police log, the report was filed at 4:05 p.m., and Hawkins was arrested soon after.
The situation was handled “quickly and quietly,” according to freshman resident dean for Elm Yard Jasmine M. Waddell.
“HUPD was on the scene, and they made an arrest, and he was escorted away,” Waddell said. “After that happened, the proctor made sure that the students were doing OK and sent around some reminders about the importance of locking your doors and preventing piggy-backing, and that when you see something, you say something.”
Both Floyd and Waddell said they were unsure how the man—allegedly Hawkins—entered the building. But Waddell added that Grays’s proximity to the street can make it more vulnerable to trespass.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the arrest, citing HUPD policy that prohibits comment on open cases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an hours-long presentation and at times tense back and forth between Cambridge residents and University planners, the Cambridge Historical Commission approved planned renovations to Harvard’s Smith Campus Center late on Thursday.
The Commission heard two cases on the campus center, which Harvard administrators expect to undergo construction from 2016 to 2018, at a public hearing on Thursday. The first case detailed plans for restoration and repair of the building’s concrete exterior and windows, while the second included the bulk of the construction plans.
While many Cambridge area residents and Harvard affiliates expressed excitement for the designs at the hearing, some worried that they did not have enough time to voice their grievances and that the changes could prove potentially unwelcoming to non-Harvard affiliates.
The Commission voted to approve the “appropriateness” of the exterior plans unanimously after Henry Moss, a member of the campus center’s design team from Bruner/Cott Architects and Planners, described in detail ways in which they planned to combat the deterioration of the building’s facade.
"I don’t want to glamorize what we're doing. It's highly technical, it's awfully tedious, and I think it's fascinating," he said.
Multiple planners on the design team cycled through an extensive presentation of the anticipated renovations. Among other plans, the campus center designs include a rooftop terrace, renovated pavilions on both the front and rear facades, and a 10th floor restricted to Harvard affiliates that will feature a bar, kitchen, and an overlooking “projecting bay.”
The renovated campus center will feature a 60 percent increase in space “devoted to publicly accessible uses,” and a 30 percent increase in both commercial food venues and bike parking, according to Gary Hammer, a senior campus planner for Harvard.
Planners said the designs are inspired by the original vision of Josep Lluís Sert, whose firm designed the building, and emphasized that the public will use the renovated building.
While the Historical Commission approved the second case detailing the campus center’s construction plans in a 5-1 vote, some residents who attended the meeting criticized the designs during the second public comment period, which followed more than two hours of presentation and comment on the first case.
Marilee B. Meyer said she did not have enough time to raise all her concerns and criticized proposed changes to the arcade area on the campus center’s first floor.
“I don’t think it’s inviting for the townie to come in there because it is so oriented on Harvard students,” Meyer said.
While Harvard affiliates will likely have access to the building at all hours, the renovated campus center’s first floor will likely be open to the public as much as it is now, according to senior director of University planning Tanya Iatridis.
Harvard hosted several open houses showcasing the campus center plans earlier this semester. Thomas J. Lucey, Harvard’s director of government relations for Cambridge, said criticisms raised at the meeting were “not dissimilar to a lot of public meetings on a variety of topics.”
“I thought the positives outweighed the negatives,” he added.
The Commission approved both sets of plans with the expectation that Harvard stay in communication about further tweaks to the designs. The Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal must also approve the designs.

Rising temperatures around the Boston area have signaled the change of season, and with it, the return of the boys of spring. Just about all the snow seems to have melted just in time for the Harvard baseball team to begin its home slate of conference games.
This weekend, the Crimson (11-12, 0-4 Ivy) will square off against opponents Princeton (4-17, 1-3) and Cornell (6-14, 3-1) in a pair of doubleheaders at O’Donnell Field.
Last season, Harvard finished with a record of 1-1 in contests against both Ivy League opponents, splitting a pair of road matchups with each.
The Crimson continues Ancient Eight play after being swept in two doubleheaders last Saturday and Sunday at Columbia and Penn, respectively. The Tigers also come into town on a low note, having been defeated twice at home by Yale this past Monday.
The Big Red, on the other hand, has had a promising start to league play after sweeping Yale in a doubleheader and splitting a doubleheader with Brown in the home confines of David F. Hoy Field.
One bright spot for the hosts is that they’re playing close games, as three of their four Ivy losses last weekend came in one-run affairs, while the other defeat was a closely contested 9-7 contest.
“Offensively, we need to keep building on leads and extending leads,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “Keeping leads at one or two runs makes us vulnerable to giving up those advantages in the late innings.”
In Saturday’s slate of action, the Crimson offense, ranked fourth in the Ivy League with a .268 batting average on the season, will face a crew of Princeton pitchers that has struggled thus far in the young season. The Tigers pitching staff sports a hefty 6.05 earned run average, which is sixth in the Ancient Eight.
On Sunday, Harvard’s lineup could get a boost from the Big Red defense, which has been shaky in the early going with a fielding percentage of .953, which is second-to-last in the conference.
The Crimson bullpen has been solid as of late, keeping the team in games and giving it a chance to win in the later innings. In Wednesday’s home opener against Holy Cross, freshman reliever Ian Miller entered the game in the top half of the second inning with his squad trailing 1-0. The rookie proceeded to retire the first 13 batters he faced to earn his first win of the season. The win also snapped a five-game team losing streak.
“It shows that we can come back from deficits,” Miller said. “Proving that we can beat teams late in the game shows a lot about the character of the team.”
On the other side of the game, Harvard captain Ethan Ferreira comes into the contest fourth in the Ancient Eight in both batting average and runs batted in.
He and the rest of the Crimson batting order will have their work cut out for them on Sunday when they face Big Red starting pitcher Brian McAfee, who tops the Ivy charts in both victories and earned run average.
So far on the year, Ivy League teams have played most of their games on the road in the southern part of the country; over spring break, Harvard played six games in western Florida. Making the trek back north, the squad must become acclimated to colder conditions.
“Definitely we saw last weekend that the cold temperature took its toll on some of the players battling injuries on our team,” McGuiggan said. “The more we can adjust to the weather and playing conditions, the better we’re going to be in the next few weeks.”
For the Crimson, this weekend represents its only meetings with Princeton and Cornell during the course of the regular season. Save the Beanpot tournament, the first round of which will take place next Wednesday against UMass-Amherst, all of Harvard’s remaining regular season games will be Ivy League contests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, two of the Ivy League’s most antithetical teams will face off in a conference showdown at Soldiers Field.
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (4-5, 0-2 Ivy) enters the match on a four-game skid, with three of its four losses coming to opponents ranked in the current top 14, while No. 3 Cornell (7-2, 3-0) has won its last four, including three victories over fellow Ancient Eight teams.
Last season saw a similar matchup between the two squads, as Harvard entered that game in Ithaca as the underdog against the then-No. 2 ranked and undefeated Big Red. The Crimson upset its Ivy League opponent 14-9, snapping a nine-game winning streak for Cornell to open the 2014 season.
The Harvard win drastically altered the remainder of the season for each team, as the loss for Cornell was the start to a 2-5 finish in its final seven games, while Harvard won four of its last six and advanced to its second Ivy League championship game in program history.
“We’ve put together a tough out-of-conference schedule,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “While we’ve lost some of those games in that [non-conference stretch], I think our team has come together over those losses…and we’ll be ready for Saturday.”
There is little doubt that Harvard will rely heavily on its offense to lead the way this weekend, as the Crimson have averaged 13.89 goals per contest, good for seventh-best in the country.
Spearheading that offensive charge will be junior attackman Deke Burns, who leads Harvard in goals this year, with 23 tallies through nine games. Burns also has a history of success against the Big Red, recording three goals and two assists in last season’s victory.
The Jamesville, N.Y., native assisted or scored on the three goals that brought the Crimson back from a 4-1 deficit and scored the go-ahead goal in the third quarter that secured the Harvard lead for the rest of the game in last year’s Harvard-Cornell matchup.
Burns’ partner-in-crime on the offensive end for the Crimson this year has been fellow junior attackman Devin Dwyer.
Dwyer, who tied Harvard team records with 12 points and eight assists in a single game earlier this year against Holy Cross, leads the Crimson with 36 points and 23 assists.
The Garden City, N.Y., native, who was named to the Tewaaraton Award Watch List before this season, leads the Ivy League in assists this year and is fifth in points.
While the Crimson offensive has found success so far this season, junior co-captain Sean Mahon believes the key to this Saturday’s game will be the Harvard defense.
“We had some success last year,” Mahon said. “[Cornell senior midfielder] Connor Buczek...is an All-American midfielder. We had our [senior defenseman] Brian Fischer cover him last year, which worked out well. Limiting their shots, taking away their strong hands, and playing fundamental team defense will be our game-plan going in.”
Leading the Crimson defense most recently has been junior goalkeeper Bryan Moore, who stopped 23 shots against No. 10 Albany in his last outing, the second-most saves of any goalkeeper in the NCAA this year and the most for an Ivy League goalie since 2010.
Moore will have his hands full as Big Red brings an offense tied for 11th in the country, led by four seniors who all started the game in last year’s loss to the Crimson. Leading the offensive unit are senior attackman Matt Donovan, who has led Cornell with 40 points and 27 goals this season, and Buczek, who was last year’s Ivy League Player of the Year.
“After we beat them last year, they are definitely out to get us back this year,” Mahon said. “We’re ready for a battle, we’re ready for a grind…and it will probably come down to a couple of possessions or a couple of ground balls. It’s going to be a very fast and physical game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After facing the No. 9 Stanford team last Friday and Ivy League rival Dartmouth on Wednesday, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (4-4, 1-1 Ivy) is looking to pick up a conference win in Providence against a struggling Brown (5-4, 0-3) squad on Saturday.
Despite a five-goal loss last week to a strong Cardinal squad and a close game against a Dartmouth team that has yet to win a game, the Crimson is hoping to pounce on a Bears team that has struggled in the conference.
After getting a shot at the Ivy League tournament last year, the Crimson is looking to pick up conference wins early on and return to the postseason.
“Our conference schedule is a tough class and we’re learning a lot,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “Some of the teams we play are a little bit bigger than we are and they just push us away so we need to stay over [the ball] and run through it a little bit harder.”
The Bears have struggled in Ivy League play thus far despite taking care of non-conference competition. Despite being a squad that has found it difficult to find the net throughout the season, the Brown defense is among the best in the Ivy League, holding opponents to only 8.67 goals on average.
The Bears however, are held back by their offense, which sits in the bottom of the Ivy League for goals, assists and shooting percentage. Despite the lack of offensive prowess, Brown has been a team that capitalizes off of penalties, shooting an Ivy League high in both free position shots, 11, and free position shot percentage, 27.5%.
Coming into the weekend, Harvard is looking to have big performances from its most consistent players including junior co-captain Audrey Todd, who netted four in Wednesday’s win, as well as sophomore midfielder Maeve McMahon and classmate attacker Marisa Romeo.
The three have combined for 74 points this season, led by Romeo’s 34 tallies. Romeo is ranked top 10 in the conference in both goals and shots.
“I think we just need to continue to run our offense,” said junior co-captain Tory Waldstein. “No team has really stopped our offense when we run it well. I think as long as our team is patient and really feels well with whatever they throw at us. “
On the defensive end, the junior co-captain and Crimson goalkeeper Kelly Weis has been quite solid over the season totaling 62 saves with a save percentage of 44.9; the defense as a whole, however, has struggled to hold opponents back, allowing an average of 10.43 goals a game—the second highest in the conference.
Beyond the defense, one of the biggest factors in the team’s success has been draw control. In a close match against Stanford on Friday, the Crimson offense capitalized on its possessions but struggled to score overall because the Cardinal held the ball for most of the game.
Harvard came out of that match with only 11 of 27 draws and followed it up with 5 of 19 against Dartmouth on Wednesday.
“Winning draw control has definitely been a challenge for us in the past few games,” Todd said. “We’re a very quick team, but person-to-person we just aren’t as built as many of the teams we play. So we just have to keep plugging away at in in practice and run through the ball and draw the foul.”
The Crimson has struggled to secure ground balls throughout the season as well, securing an Ivy League low 109 ground balls total. In Wednesday’s game however, the team secured 17 en route to a much-needed conference win.
Despite the lack of ground balls, the team has maintained the ball in possession— the team has the lowest number of turnovers  in the conference, 82, by a wide margin.
Though there’s a lot of pressure sitting on the offense to capitalize off of possessions, the attack has responded well.
Despite averaging only 76.5% shots on goal in the month of March, the Harvard offense is taking better shots overall, shooting 89.6 over their last four games.
“We’re just preparing for different looks,” Miller said “We try to run an offensive set based on principle and then we adjust to different types of defenses. We just need to work hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although it currently stands with a .500 record at 4-4, the Harvard women’s lacrosse squad has sharpened a young team into a mature squad ready to dive into Ivy League play because of its tough schedule.
The Crimson (4-4, 2-1 Ivy) has contended against upper-echelon teams such as No. 7 Syracuse, No. 4 Virginia, No. 13 Stanford, and No. 15 Princeton. Harvard has held the scoring gap to five goals or fewer against these teams, notably falling by only a single goal to the then-No. 5 Orange.
“We haven’t been winning, but we’ve been competing, which is exciting,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I think that the idea was to build confidence in the program and then compete with the top programs in the country, which we’re doing right now. Then we have to start winning some of these games. We’re close—we’re just not finishing up the games.”
The Crimson’s only four losses came from its top-15 matchups, with Harvard notching four decisive victories over Hofstra, Columbia, Stetson, and Dartmouth, The team is optimistic that the tough schedule will pay off in Ivy League play.
“Our coach thinks it’s really important to play a tough schedule,” said junior co-captain and defender Tory Waldstein. “It really helps us because now, as we’re heading into more league play, those out-of-league games that were really tough competition and ended up being losses in our record are actually more important…. Overall, it definitely helps our team. It gives us more confidence in terms of what we can accomplish moving forward. Even though we’ve lost a few games, it’s definitely a good thing.”
Harvard edged out Columbia, 13-9, in its first league game of the season. The team’s sole league loss, 17-12, came in an away game against then-No. 13 Princeton—a match that was tied, 6-6, heading into halftime.
The Crimson squad is ready to face more Ancient Eight  teams in the coming weeks.
“I think everyone is really excited to get back into Ivy League play,” said junior co-captain and  midfielder Audrey Todd. “In-league games are always a fight to the finish, and each one is critical since only four teams make the end-of-season tournament.”
A major rivalry matchup will occur in mid-April when Harvard competes against Penn in its next home Ivy League contest. The Crimson fell to the Quakers in double overtime in the Ivy League Tournament semifinal last season, ending Harvard’s 2014 campaign. Penn went on to win the league tournament and make the second round of the NCAA tournament.
“I think [Penn] is definitely one of our biggest rivals in the league,” Waldstein said. “So that’s a game we’re all really looking forward too. We’re definitely taking one game at a time and really just trying to make sure we are successful enough to get into the tournament, and then we can be successful there too.”
Although the Crimson failed to clinch the Ivy League title last year, the 2015 Harvard squad has hopes of improved play and execution this league season.
“We’re pretty competitive, and we’re pretty athletic across the board,” Miller said. “I think we’re a lot faster than we have been in years past. In terms of competitive nature and game understanding and things like that, I think we’re similar, but person-for-person we’re probably a lot faster than we have been.”
The team’s athleticism and speed is apparent in defensive and draw control statistics. On defense, the Crimson has successfully executed 94-of-110 clear attempts overall and 37-of-42  in Ivy League play. Harvard has also forced 52 turnovers, including nine from sophomore defender Emma Ford.
Sophomore midfielder Maeve McMahon leads Harvard in draw controls, contributing 18 of the team’s 87 on the season.
“We are balanced,” Miller said. “We’re very, very balanced. We’re balanced on attack, we’re balanced defensively. We are significantly better in the clearing game than we were last year at this time. We’re quick and agile to the ball and on the draw circle.”
Offensively, sophomore attack Marisa Romeo leads with 25 goals, followed by 15 goals from Todd. Sophomore attack Megan Hennessey has chipped in a team-high  10 assists and contributed the second-highest number of groundballs, 11, and draw controls, 14. Five of the six top scorers for the Crimson are underclassmen.
“I think that we are really strong on the defensive side of the ball because most of us have been playing together for at least two years—some of us three years,” Todd said. “We are a bit younger on the attacking side of the ball, so we are still working through a few kinks. But we have a ton of talent, so soon we will be really, really good.”
Three junior captains lead Harvard on the field: Todd, Waldstein, and junior goalie Kelly Weis.
“I think it’s worked really well,” Waldstein said. “We’re all in different positions…it brings three unique perspectives and leadership to different parts of the field. I also think we’re pretty different in terms of personality, which I think is really helpful. Some of us are more talkative or more outspoken, so it really adds a nice balance working together.”
Waldstein and Weis lead the Crimson on the defensive side of the ball, with Waldstein tallying four caused turnovers and Weis recording 63 saves along with a 44.9 save percentage.
“It’s nice to have three captains who sit in different position,” Miller said. “Kelly obviously in the cage—she can see everything from back there. Tory is the defensive communicator and the communicator in the clearing game.”
Offensively, Todd ranks among the top four on the team in goals and assists.
“Audrey is one of those players that if you’re not a coach, maybe you’re not going to notice her,” Miller said. “But for a coach, you see that she fills up those stat columns, she does all the little stuff well, she’s ground balling, she’s draw controlling, she’s taking shots, she’s finishing shots, she plays great defense…[The captains’] expectations for themselves and the program are pretty high, and they’ve provided very good leadership up to date. They compete.”
Despite siting at only .500 thus far on the season, Harvard has averaged roughly 11 goals per game and notched a 77.3 on-goal shooting percentage.
“I think this team probably has the most potential of the three years that I’ve been here,” Waldstein said.“I can’t say that I’m anything but happy with the group,” Miller added. “We practice hard, we learn pretty quickly, and we compete. We’re not rolling over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mention the phrase “sophomore slump” around the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, and you may raise some unhappy eyebrows.
Coming off a record-setting season that ended in a heartbreaking, double-overtime loss to Ancient Eight rival Penn in the end-of-year Ivy League tournament, the squad (4-4, 1-1 Ivy) has set expectations for the now-sophomore core that shouldered much of the team’s load last season. With the help of the class of 2017 last season, it qualified for the Ivy League tournament for the first time in three years. With the past results, those expectations have never been higher for the 2015 campaign.
“[The sophomores] enjoy playing, practice is fun for them, [and] they want to get better every day,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “They play with reckless abandon. But they bring a sense of light-heartedness to practice that is good for the group.”
This year, youth has ruled once again. Underclassmen dominate the roster, making up 16 of the 24 spots on a team that features only one senior. It has been that small cluster of sophomores, though, that contributed to much of the Harvard’s success last season and continue to be difference-makers this year.
Pacing that group has been standout attack Marisa Romeo, who entered Harvard last year ranked as the No. 7 recruit in the country by Inside Lacrosse.
Romeo’s freshman campaign featured a starting position in all 16 of the Crimson’s matches and a team and league-high 48 goals, including nine hat tricks, and four game-winning goals to lead the Ancient Eight.
The Syracuse, N.Y., native has picked up right where she left off last season, netting a team-high 23 goals already this season in only seven games. Tough competition hasn’t slowed Romeo down, with the sophomore tallying 12 goals in four games against opponents ranked in the top-13 in the nation.
The sophomore’s insatiable desire to constantly improve her play may be the secret to her success so early in her collegiate career.
“[Romeo] is just naturally a great dodger and scorer,” junior co-captain Tory Waldstein said. “But now she’s developing her cutting game and developed her feeding game, and I think that will help her continue to be successful.”
Junior co-captain Audrey Todd agreed with Waldstein, stating that one of Romeo’s most impressive attributes is her appetite for improvement.
“This year, she has also been working really hard on her feeding game,” Todd said. “It also hugely benefits our team because we have been looking to increase our assists.”
Assisting Romeo, both early this season and last season, has been midfielder Megan Hennessey.
The sophomore did it all for the Crimson last year, registering the second-most assists and draw controls and third-most goals and ground balls as a freshman.
The five-foot-four Winchester, Mass., native plays much bigger than her small stature would indicate. This year, Hennessey has already surpassed her assist total from last year, helping on 10 of the team’s 90 goals, the most of any Harvard player.
“[Feeding the ball to her teammates] was something [Hennessey] really wanted to work on this season,” Waldstein said. “We rely a lot on her to get those feeds to the middle, and I think she’ll only keep improving as the season goes on.”
Eight of Hennessey’s 10 assists have come in Harvard’s four games against ranked opponents, including three against conference opponent No. 13 Princeton, the most for any Crimson player in any game this season.
Playing alongside Hennessey in the midfield, classmate Maeve McMahon has provided steady production for the Harvard squad after her freshman campaign was abruptly ended by a season-ending injury just four games into the season.
“She fills up every stats column, every game,” Todd said. “She’s extremely scrappy in the draw circle, and she helps us come up with 50/50 balls when we need them most. She also just has a knack for getting open in the settled attack, and when people see her and feed her the ball, she finishes her shots.”
Starting in all eight of the Crimson’s games this season, McMahon has made her presence felt on the field, leading the team with 18 draw controls and netting 12 goals already this season, including a hat trick against No. 5 Syracuse and two goals and two assists versus No. 9 Stanford.
Representing this star-studded second-year group on the defensive end are standout defenders Emma Ford, Michelle Nesselbush, and Marina Burke.
Ford, a full-time starter last year, brings great experience to the back line, even only in her second year, and is again in the starting lineup for Harvard.
The Skaneateles, N.Y., native has provided a spark for the Crimson in the form of a team-high eight caused turnovers, three more than she tallied all of last year.
Additionally, Ford has led the Crimson in ground balls in four of the team’s seven games this year and sits at first in the Ivy League for ground balls per game, with 2.5 per contest.
Starting next to Ford on the defensive end is Nesselbush, who, despite coming onto the team with less lacrosse experience than her classmates, has stepped up her play in her second season.
Last season, Nesselbush started two of the eight total games in which she saw action but has been a mainstay for the Crimson defensive line this year, starting all eight contests for Harvard.
Waldstein, who plays alongside the sophomore on defense, noted Nesselbush’s increased contributions this season.
“[Nesselbush] has done a great job this year of taking on a big role in the defense, and she’s been called upon to mark up on some very good players,” Waldstein said. “She’s done a great job of being reliable, especially from last year to this year, and she’s stepped up to become a big part of the field.”
The sophomore, whose two sisters are defenders for the No. 6 Northwestern lacrosse team, has clearly solidified her position as a defensive stalwart for the Crimson squad.
Rounding out the youthful Crimson defense is Burke, who has made a smooth transition to the defensive side of the ball after spending her freshman season playing in the midfield.
The Westwood, Mass., native wasted no time in making an impact on last year’s team as a freshman, causing a team-high 20 turnovers, which was also good for fifth-best in the Ancient Eight.
Burke has continued to be a dominant force this season, collecting seven ground balls and forcing four turnovers while starting all eight matches for Harvard this season.
The season ahead poses anything but an easy task for the young Harvard team. A schedule that includes six games against top-20 teams in a season consisting of only 15 matches would be daunting for any team as young as the Crimson.
Despite the difficult schedule, the squad has risen to the challenges it has faced thus far, losing narrowly by one goal to No. 5 Syracuse and dropping a 13-9 contest to No. 8 Virginia, after holding a three-goal lead the second half.
With the experience of one-plus season under their belt, Waldstein argues that the underclassmen are better prepared than ever for the challenges ahead.
“It’s great for a young team to play those top-20 teams and to know [last year] as freshmen that they can actually play with these [teams],” Waldstein said. “It’s really good for our confidence level going forward. A lot of the mistakes that we have made have been young mistakes, which only goes to show that there’s only good things to come as we get more experienced.”
What truly makes this young corps of players special, Miller said, is the energy that the team brings to the field every day in practice. There is little doubt that, for this budding Harvard unit, the best is still yet to come.
“They enjoy playing; practice is fun for them,” Miller said. “They’re very good players, and they’re smart, and they pick up on concepts quickly. But, more than that, the sophomore class is tight-knit and have good chemistry. They enjoy the grind, and they want to get better every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Stetson swept the Harvard baseball team in the opening weekend of spring break, outscoring the group 43-6, the Crimson’s season came to an early crossroads. Coming after two wins against Wofford and three against Mercer, the Stetson series halted Harvard’s momentum.
After a day of rest, the Crimson (11-12, 0-4 Ivy) took the field against UMass in a doubleheader. The Minutemen took an early 2-0 lead in the first frame, forcing Harvard to play from behind. But the Crimson responded, scoring in every inning to take the first game decisively, 9-3. In the second game of the doubleheader, Harvard again played from behind, but the team plated eight runs in the fifth and sixth innings to build up a comfortable lead and won, 11-8.
The pair of wins against UMass revitalized the Crimson after the Stetson series and set the team’s 2015 campaign on a different path than that of any recent season. Harvard closed its spring break with three wins against Army to compile a winning record in nonconference play for the first time since 2005, the last year the Crimson won the Ivy League Championship. Harvard has won as many games in the nonconference portion of its season as the team won all of last season.
“The 10-8 start was definitely a culmination of timely hitting and good at-bats, with good pitching to keep our offensive opponents in check,” said senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan.
Although the Crimson lost nine seniors to graduation last May, including second-team All-Ivy finisher Carlton Bailey and honorable mention Kyle Larrow, eight returning seniors have filled that void.
“We have a lot of guys who have a ton of playing experience over the past two or three years,” McGuiggan said. “That’s definitely something we can use to our advantage throughout the year. We have guys that we can rely on that have been there before and done some good things throughout the Ivy League.”
That experience has made an impact up and down the lineup. Compared to last season, when Harvard collectively had a .241 batting average in March, this year’s squad is batting .268. Since the team’s average has improved in each of the past three seasons, the Crimson offense hopes to improve upon its early success against the Ancient Eight.
McGuiggan and senior Ethan Ferreira have paced Harvard’s offense thus far, batting .369 and .372, respectively. The second baseman and catcher each have collected at least 30 hits and have combined for 35 RBI, more than a third of the team’s total.
Returning all-Ivy first-team selection and leadoff hitter Mike Martin has had a slower start to his senior season. But he continues to make noise on the base paths, leading the Ivy League with 13 stolen bases.
“Mike’s a playmaker when he gets on the bases,” senior pitcher Tanner Anderson said. “There’s really no one who can throw him out.”
The mostly upperclassmen lineup has received a boost from two freshmen, Conor Quinn and Matt Rothenberg. While Quinn has started most games for Harvard and has collected five RBI and scored 11 runs, Rothenberg has stepped up off the bench, batting .333 and knocking in five RBI in 30 at-bats.
Despite one of Harvard’s best showings in nonconference play in recent seasons, the team opened Ivy play right where it left off last season—on the losing end of a series of competitive games. After losing its final seven conference games last season, two in extra innings and five by fewer than three runs, the Crimson fell to Columbia and Penn in its four opening Ivy games, two in extra innings and all four by two runs or fewer.
“Obviously losing three out of those four games on walk-off hits is devastating,” McGuiggan said. “But we can’t hang our heads too much after this past weekend because we know we still have a lot of good opportunities ahead of us especially against the three other teams on our side in Dartmouth, Brown, and Yale.”
Last year Harvard also went winless against the Lions and Quakers, but lost all four games by at least three runs. The increased competitiveness of the games this year was largely due to the Crimson’s starting pitchers.
Returning from an injury that sidelined him for most of his junior season, Anderson took the ball against Penn and gave up just one hit and one run in seven innings of work. Although Anderson’s start highlighted the weekend, sophomore Nick Gruener, senior Matt Timoney, and junior Sean Poppen also put together strong outings that were spoiled by lack of run support.
“I think it’s better that we lost these opening games rather than getting complacent later,” Anderson said. “Now we know that it’s time to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the sport of softball, only one thing is guaranteed every play: the pitcher will throw the ball. Every subsequent event that unfolds on the field depends on the pitcher’s actions, and for that reason, the control lies in her hands.
For the Harvard softball team (10-15, 1-3 Ivy), the responsibility of controlling the game rests on the shoulders of four players: senior right-hander Laura Ricciardone, senior left-hander Gabrielle Ruiz, junior right-hander Morgan Groom, and sophomore right-hander Taylor Cabe. Together they comprise the 2015 pitching staff, each bringing her own contributions to the circle.
“The pitcher in the circle needs to set a tone,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “The pitchers have a large responsibility on the team. If they have a bad day, it ends in a loss, so they need to go out there and have a good day. If someone’s not having a good day, another pitcher needs to pick them up. We need to be able to compete in the circle.”
For the past couple of years, a familiar face in the circle for the Crimson has been Ricciardone, a Slidell, La., native who is finishing up her Harvard career as one of seven seniors on this year’s team.
Ricciardone has served as the main starter for the squad for the past two seasons. She tossed a total of just over 155 innings in 2014, and already has over 60 innings under her belt this year.
Over the course of her career, Ricciardone has accumulated an overall ERA of 2.04, averaging 4.46 strikeouts per game and and winning just under 70 percent of her starts. As one of the leaders on and off the field, Ricciardone sees the need to leave a mark on the program.
“I’ve had three seasons here and every season here, I’ve been able to pitch a lot, so I’ve enjoyed all my time here at Harvard,” Ricciardone said. “Myself and the rest of the senior class are looking to go out with an Ivy League title, just like we came into the season.”
In fact, the pitching staff this year mirrors last year’s, giving the squad the opportunity to take advantage of the same dynamic. The only difference is that each pitcher now has one more year of experience under her belt that aids her when the game is on the line.
In particular, Cabe has hit her stride during her sophomore campaign, building off a freshman year in which she threw 100 innings for the Crimson. During the 26 games in which she had control of the ball in 2014, Cabe tallied a 2.66 ERA while averaging 4.97 strikeouts per game.
This season, Cabe has once again established herself as a throwing force, already having tossed 53.2 innings in 2015.
“Taylor is showing a lot of consistency this year,” Allard said. “She is a lot stronger mentally in the circle, she has more consistency with her pitches, and she is owning her game plan more.  She has really stepped up this year. She has gotten the results and the wins that she’s wanted, but we put her up against some really tough teams, and she’s performed really well.”
This season, Groom has established herself as another starting option for Harvard, while Ruiz has been called upon most often to come in behind other pitchers. Early on, she has quickly become the workhorse in mid-week games.
But as much as pitching is centered around individual performance, this year’s staff has been focused on moving the ball around between hands in order to test different combinations of arms and find the one that fits the best. Already this year, each pitcher has seen the circle at least seven times, each accumulating at least 10 innings.
Yet the emphasis for the staff is not so much about who starts, but rather the  steps taken to best position the team to win.
“I think that the pitching from here on out will continue to be mixed,” senior infielder Katherine Lantz said. “I don’t think there has been any set lineup…but I think that all the pitchers have bought into the idea that they will all be working together to win games, so it won’t be uncommon to see two or three pitchers work together to win games.”
This past weekend’s games provided perfect examples of the mix of arms that Harvard has employed this season. The eight-inning battle against Penn Sunday afternoon that featured 29 runs between the two teams saw all four pitchers contribute, while the earlier games against the Quakers saw Ricciardone, Cabe, and Ruiz combine to finish out the game.
Friday’s series against Columbia saw Ricciardone go all seven innings in the opening match, while Cabe and Groom both threw in the Crimson’s 3-0 loss later that afternoon.
“It’s an irreplaceable feeling knowing that there are three people behind you to back you up,” Ricciardone said. “It allows you to go out there without the pressure of thinking it’s all on you. It’s a great tool to have four of us on staff with experience and who are ready to throw.”
When all the balls and strikes boil down, the ultimate goal of the team this year is to bring the Ivy League title back to Cambridge, and with the strong arms of the pitchers, combined with timely hitting and defense, that goal might be within reach this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The one thing I can say about Harvard is everyone returns the phone calls.”
That is the biggest difference Mike Zandler has noticed in his 20 months working as an assistant coach and the recruiting coordinator for the Harvard baseball team. Zandler has been coaching college baseball since 2002 and previously worked as an assistant coach at Davidson and as the head coach at the University of Illinois Springfield.
The combination of academics and steady improvement on the field under third-year head coach Bill Decker has made Zandler’s phone ring a lot more frequently with return calls from potential recruits, and has made the Crimson a legitimate contender in recruiting battles for elite high school baseball prospects all across the United States.
“I was looking for the best combination of academics and athletics,” freshman infielder Matt Rothenberg said. “I feel like Harvard’s the pinnacle of that. You can’t really find a better place academically and athletically. The location is great, and everything about it kind of sold me. When I was up here on my visit, that kind of sealed the deal.”
Rothenberg, a Boca Raton, Fla., native who was rated the No. 44 third baseman in the class of 2014 by Perfect Game, is part of Zandler’s first recruiting class, a group that features nine first-years who have already played a role in the team’s best start in recent memory. Harvard’s recruiting classes typically feature between seven and nine players, much smaller than the 12 to 14-player classes that perennial powers like LSU and Florida show off.
“We try to forecast a couple years in advance what we think our needs are going to be,” Zandler said. “I think one of the things we really place an emphasis on is making sure that we find the right person that’s a good fit for Harvard and the core values of our program, and a player that we believe projects to be an impact player for our baseball program.”
This year’s freshmen hail from eight states, ranging from Massachusetts to Hawaii. The group features four pitchers (three righties and a lefty) and five position players (two outfielders, a catcher, an infielder, and a superutility player in Rothenberg). While the group is certainly diverse, the individuals have bonded both as a class and with the other members of the team and have adjusted well to collegiate life and Division I athletics.
“The biggest transition [from high school] is definitely the time commitment,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “I think we’ve definitely had some positive experiences with them so far this season already. I think they’re going to further contribute as we move into Ivy League play and down the stretch.”
The freshmen have found roles all over the diamond thus far for the Crimson, with many stepping into new positions. John Fallon, a highly touted prospect out of Houston who was an Under Armour preseason All-American before his junior and senior seasons, was a shortstop in high school but has played second and third base at Harvard. Rothenberg played almost exclusively third base before coming to Cambridge.
“I feel like [third] is my position,” Rothernberg said. “But if playing second base or playing left field or playing whatever can get me into the lineup, I can work hard at that, and I’m all for it.”
Dylan Combs, a left-handed pitcher out of Kailua, Hawaii, who also starred in football in high school, has become a lefty specialist in the Crimson bullpen, appearing in eight games and recording 11 strikeouts in seven innings of work this season.Ian Miller, a righty from Brooklyn, has also made nine relief appearances for Harvard. The duo expects to see more action following sophomore Kevin Rex’s season-ending elbow injury.
Conor Quinn has seen the most game action of any Crimson freshman thus far. The outfielder from Amherst, Mass., is the team’s starting right fielder and has appeared in all but one of Harvard’s games, posting three doubles and five RBIs in 75 plate appearances.
“All freshmen go through growing pains once they get on the Division I level,” Zandler said. “They recognize that these are some pretty good lineups or pretty good pitchers we’re facing, but we have a number of guys who have filled in nicely.”
Fallon, Quinn, and Rothenberg comprised the bottom third of the Crimson’s batting order and combined for two hits in the second game of the team’s doubleheader against Penn on Monday.
The class of 2018 also features Austin Black, a left-handed hitting outfielder who hails from the same high school as senior center fielder Mike Martin; Brandon Wachs, a walk-on catcher from San Diego; Noah Zavolas, a right-handed pitcher from Acton, Mass., who has made five relief appearances this season; and Phoenix native Garrett Rupp, a 6’5” righty.
“We want players that are not only ridiculously strong in the classroom but have options in major Division I conferences,” Zandler said. “We want to be recruiting top 100 players out of their class each year, and I think we’re well on our way to doing that.”
Another unique characteristic of this year’s class is the return of the Massachusetts influence to Harvard baseball. Quinn and Zavolas are two of the six players from the Bay State on this year’s roster.
Sophomore catcher Josh Ellis had been the only Massachusetts native in the past two years’ recruiting classes. Recruiting local players was a hallmark of the late Joe Walsh, the Crimson’s coach from 1996 to 2012, who recruited seniors McGuiggan, captain Ethan Ferreira, and outfielder Jack Colton from the surrounding area.
“Being from the Boston area, I was fortunate enough that Coach Walsh always took a lot of pride in getting a couple local Massachusetts guys on the team every year,” McGuiggan said. “I was really fortunate that Coach Walsh sought me out from the South Shore and I was definitely on board with Harvard as soon as Coach Walsh jumped in the mix.”
With his first class on campus making an impact, Zandler is currently hot on the recruiting trail, working to compile two recruiting classes, the classes of 2019 and 2020, simultaneously. As the level of talent for the players who have committed to the team and the product on the field have both improved, the 2015 season and beyond look bright for Harvard baseball.
“We feel that this is a really good class, but our job as coaches is to basically one-up ourselves every year,” Zandler said.
At least he knows that everyone will be returning his phone calls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past two years, the Harvard softball team has entered the final weekend of Ivy League play within striking distance of reaching the championship series. Each time, the Crimson has won the first game of a weekend series with Dartmouth and then dropped the final three.
It wasn’t for a lack of ability the last few years. Hitting? Check. Record-setting slugger Kasey Lange ’14, who holds the Harvard record for home runs, led the Crimson with six home runs and 29 RBI. Pitching? Check. Senior Laura Ricciardone led the Ivy League in ERA last year, allowing 1.53 runs per nine innings. Speed? Check. Senior Andrea Del Conte and then-captain Shelbi Olson ‘14 were the top two base stealers in the Ancient Eight.
This year, the team has faced the added challenge of a severe Cambridge winter that forced the team to stay inside the bubble longer than it normally would.
In order to escape the record-breaking Boston winter, the Crimson started off the season by embarking on three road trips, to Florida, South Carolina, and California.
Although these tournaments generally provide tough competition, in this year in particular, the Crimson struggled.
This struggle was especially apparent in California, where Harvard dropped five in a row at the San Diego Classic II. The bats struggled in particular, posting only four runs throughout the tournament and getting shut out over the final three games. The team closed the trip strong, however, winning four of its last six games.
Since returning from the West Coast, the Crimson bats have been on a tear to start Ivy League play. In the last three games, the team has scored 14 runs or more.
Seniors Emily Gusse and Katherine Lantz have each provided some pop to replace Lange. They are tied for the team lead with three home runs apiece. Some freshmen have also been coming up hot. Freshman Alexa Altchek produced five runs batted in in Tuesday’s game against Rhode Island.
“I think it has been kind of a struggle, but we are finally on the right track, especially in our performance against Penn where we scored 14 runs,” junior pitcher Morgan Groom said. “A lot of people are really coming into their own.”
Whereas most of the run production came from a singular source last season, this year’s team is balanced up and down the lineup. Nine Crimson batters have driven in seven or more runs this year. “We lost Kasey, Shelbi and [Allson Scott], but our freshman class has done a great job coming in filling those gaps,” senior catcher Katherine Appelbe said. “Our offensive lineup is definitely great one through nine. This year offensively we’ve had a pretty good year, and...what we did yesterday we would like to continue.”
The pitching staff returns all four members of the rotation from last year, led by the returning Ricciardone. However, early in the season, it has not dominated as much as last season when it led the Ivy League in ERA.
“It’s been frustrating because so many parts of our game are so good,” Groom said. “Sometimes our pitching is on, and we are pitching fantastic, and sometimes our defense is spotless, [and] it just seems when we come together and we are losing games, one of those aspects isn’t on.”
After dropping three of its first four in conference play, the Crimson is starting from behind in the league, a position that it was not in last year. To start Ivy League play in 2014, the Crimson rattled off 12 straight wins after an early tie.
“Now since we lost our doubleheader against Penn, we really have to fight for this season, whereas the last two seasons we lost right at the end,” Groom said. “I think it’s just going to push us to work a little harder for the rest of the season.”
Three stalwarts have recently dominated the Ivy League in recent years: Dartmouth, Penn, and Harvard. The championship has been between the Big Green and the Quakers each of the past two years. However, this year, the consensus is that the Ancient Eight as a whole has improved.
“Going into Ivy League [play], you have to treat every team as the same, you have to play at your own level every game,” Groom said. “Dartmouth and us have recently been the best in the North and Penn in the South. A lot of teams this year are better than they used to be, so it’s a lot more of an even playing ground."
With the weather beginning to heat up, so are the bats of the Crimson. If it can get its pitching and fielding up to the same level, the team believes it has a chance to win plenty of games.
“When we get all three of those things going, the results are going to be amazing,” Groom said. Because of this increase in competition, Harvard feels like it is still in the thick of the championship hunt, despite having to play catch up.
“Honestly, the conference this year is anybody’s game,” Appelbe said. “The next 16 games, we are fighting every inning to win every pitch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team is in a precarious position. Having started with immensely high preseason expectations, and rising as high as 10th in the national polls, the team has now lost four straight games and is in danger of not making the Ivy League tournament, its only legitimate shot at a postseason berth.
The season started off well for the Crimson (4-5, 0-2 Ivy), as the team won four of its first five games, losing only to then-No. 6 Duke in a hard fought contest. The team had two Tewaarton Watchlist players in junior attackman Devin Dwyer and junior defenseman and captain Steve Jahelka and an additional preseason All-American in junior defenseman Bobby Duvnjak. The squad was looking to build off a regular season Ivy League championship and a trip to the NCAA tournament last year in taking the team to new heights in 2015.
But Harvard also had a few warnings. To start with, the team has one of the highest strengths of schedule in the nation, with its slate of games ranked as high as the fifth-most difficult by the NCAA. Additionally, many of these games, especially those against Duke and UNC, national powerhouses outside the Ivy League, were to be played away and in rapid succession.
“We’ve played really good teams,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We’ve played really good competition, and unfortunately we’ve had trouble with gaining possessions against them, and that can really cost you.”
And then the injuries started. So far this season, Jahelka, who in years past has served as an anchor and vocal presence on the Harvard defense, has only been able to play in two of the Crimson’s nine games. Duvnjak has not been able to play at all. In addition to these two fixtures of last year’s Harvard defense, junior defensive midfielder Jack Breit has also only played in five of the Crimson’s games due in large part to injury.
Additionally, after a lackluster start to his season, tri-captain and senior goaltender Jake Gambitsky has also been out for the Crimson, meaning that the Harvard defensive unit as it currently stands is very different from the one that had been expected to start the season.
“We’re a deep team,” Gambitsky said. “Everyone out there can play Division I lacrosse at the highest level. It’s been tough, but some of the personnel changes that we’ve had this year have really allowed underclassmen to step up and contribute on the field, which is definitely a positive thing.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the lack of defensive continuity has shown on the scoreboard. Harvard has allowed 13.8 goals per game this season. The NCAA only publishes a ranking of the top-50 (of 68) Division I lacrosse teams in terms of goals against, but the 10th has allowed only 11.4. Twice this season, teams have managed to score over 20 goals on the Crimson, compared to no times in the previous five years.
This responsibility does not fall entirely on the shoulders of the Harvard defense, however. The two teams that managed to score over twenty goals both have top-five offenses, in Duke and Albany.  The Great Danesspecifically has one of the most prolific attackmen to ever play collegiate lacrosse in senior Lyle Thompson, who netted nine goals and three assists in that game.
“Our defense has given up goals,” Wojcik said. “But our defense is also getting a lot better every single day. We’re moving in the right direction, and that’s what we need to see.”
Despite its defensive struggles, the Crimson’s offense has been playing exceptionally well. The team ranks seventh in the nation in scoring offense, averaging nearly 14 goals per game. Dwyer ranks seventh in the nation in assists per game, and junior attackman Deke Burns ranks 16th in goals per game.
And Harvard’s postseason hopes are not quite over. In order to gain a bid to the national tournament, the team would probably need to win the Ivy League tournament, which is still possible. However, only the top four teams in the conference make the tournament, and, unfortunately for the Crimson, the Ivy League is exceptionally deep.
Over the remainder of its season, Harvard will go up against the conference’s best, in Cornell and Princeton, and it must do well in those games, as well as in its games against weaker conference opponents Penn and Yale. Early losses to an emergent Brown team and lackluster Dartmouth squad have dug a hole for the Crimson, but escape is still possible if the team can do well against all of those teams.
“Its tough to start out 0-2 in conference games,” Gambitsky said. “But in the Ivy League, anyone can beat anyone. Last year we started 2-0, and compared to that, this is definitely a hole, but our effort and our mindset have been up to our standards in every game. We just need to execute better to win these next games.”
Whether or not that happens, the future is still bright for Harvard. Players who might not have gained any experience this year are instead playing often and improving rapidly. The defensive unit that returns next year will likely have more depth and experience than it ever has, and the offense that has been so prolific this season will return with a vengeance. This season may not have gone the way that the Crimson would have liked, but the team’s record does not tell the whole story.
“These early games that we lost were tough,” Wojcik said. “But I really feel like the team is improving each week. At this point, in terms of what we really want to see from our guys, that is what is really important.”

“Lime and Punishment”? “War and Peeps”? I’ve never been the biggest fan of reading Russian literature, but replace those dense pages with chips and salsa and some Peeps marshmallows and you’ve got my attention!
What am I talking about, you ask? Let me explain. Yesterday I had the privilege of stumbling upon a really hidden gem among the 1001 events happening on campus every day— The Edible Book Contest held in Lamont Library.
This annual event is essentially just what it sounds like, a contest where people create handmade books entirely out of edible materials and show them off. While attendance of the event may have been less than ideal, (come on Harvard, show your support for the wonderful library staff who deal with your 3 a.m. antics) it was more than made up for by the quality of the delectable creations and enthusiasm held by the librarians organizing it.
“It might be the one time that a librarian tells you to bring food into the library,” said Carie McGinnis, Preservation Librarian for Houghton Library.
But if you were like me, you’ve probably never heard of an Edible Book Contest, and likely have a number of questions ranging from “Wait, is this real?” to “Am I allowed to eat the books?” To clear up any confusion, this event is Harvard’s version of the International Edible Book Festival, which is held each year on April 1st (no, this is not a late April Fool’s Day joke). The library staff really enjoys this event because “it brings together two loves, books and food.” More importantly, to answer the question on all of your minds, yes some books are eaten after the competition.
Books submitted this year included a wide range of punny creations from an entire recreation of the Harry Potter Series, featuring my personal favorites, “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkabanana” and “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fireball.” Others included “Game of Scones”, and “Alice in Wonderbread” by Lewis Carrot.
“My favorites are ones where you can use the title and the author’s name” said Priscilla Anderson, Senior Preservation Librarian and organizer of the event. So extra brownie points there for “Alice in Wonderbread.”
Feeling like you missed the opportunity of a lifetime to showcase your natural born book-making talent? Worry not, it’s never too early to start planning for next year! Using advice from Anderson (a book-making expert and creator of “Fifty Shades of Grease,”)  like skimming The New York Times Bestseller List for punny titles and utilizing marzipan as a medium, you too can create your own edible masterpiece, or at least one that is better than swai. Bon appetit!

This summer, new internet address suffixes or domain endings will become available, in addition to the usual .com, .org, or .net. With this expansion comes excitement about the possibilities of new web addresses (!!), but also concern from leading brands, companies, and public figures such as Taylor Swift, Microsoft, and, of course, Harvard.
What’s all the concern about? The emergence of new domain endings, in particular .porn and .adult. Hmm..... Nonetheless, our university has supposedly preemptively bought these up as a precautionary measure. #smartmoves

Congratulations! Upon careful review of your application, we are pleased to inform you that you have been admitted into the college that accepts more tourists than it does students and where the feet of snow is higher than your GPA!
So, you’ve been admitted to Harvard. (I say this genuinely this time: congratulations!) However, there is a lot that Harvard should tell you in your admissions letter, yet they choose to conceal. Fear not, Flyby is here to help. Here is what your admissions letter should have told you:
