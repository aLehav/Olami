After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Three years ago, Earl Sweatshirt released his debut album, “Earl,” on which he rapped explicitly about raping and murdering women. But on “Chum,” his first single off of “Doris,” he opens with the shockingly honest lines, “It’s probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless / And I just used to say ‘I hate him’ in dishonest jest.” A transformed Earl raps on “Doris,” which sounds strangely like a veteran album from the 19-year-old rapper. On “Doris,” Earl casts aside the gruesome world he had created on his debut for a more frank and personal approach. This newfound sincerity, along with Earl’s usual stunning delivery and lyricism, makes “Doris” shine both emotionally and technically.
 
“Doris” is packed with themes of loneliness, self-hatred, and the emptiness of fame. “Burgundy” opens with Vince Staples parodying the music industry as he snaps, “Why you so depressed and sad all the time, like a little bitch? What’s the problem, man? Niggas want to hear you rap, don’t nobody care about how you feel.” Earl’s first verse addresses more personal themes than he did on the entirety of his debut, expressing lament at prioritizing his music over his grandmother’s health (“Doris” is named in her memory), the absence of his father and its impact on his career (“I’m afraid I’m going to blow it / And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet”), and his struggles with drug use to deal with the resulting anxiety (“Heart racing til blunt is lit, like, ‘He don’t give a fuck again, right?’”). Although by no means avant-garde, these themes are new to the talented young rapper, and the unrelenting barrage of excuses, apologies, and boasts transmits a common message: Earl wants to recreate himself, and he wants to prove that he can do it.
 
Earl constantly criticizes the person he was at the age of 15. On “Centurion,” he turns once again to the darker themes of murder and drug use, but this apparent reversion to his earlier material is turned on its head when Earl ends his first verse with “Hood, rich, wild, and ‘bout to run amok / Road to Hell paved with cement, covered trusseled drugs, toughen up.” The hook, a stark repetition of the line, “Well, alright. Okay, if that’s how you truly feel about it, then,” seems to play the role of Earl’s consciousness, emphasizing a lack of willpower and control over his actions. “Burgundy”—the title of which refers to the carpet Earl and Vince Staples describe as the setting for their songs about raped and murdered women on “Earl”—expresses discontent at the hollowness of his career. “Burgundy” is one of several tracks on “Doris” that seem to revisit “Earl,” each with a message of disillusionment or regret. 
 
This sincere approach to “Doris” is even further enhanced by Earl’s usual astonishing lyricism. The internal rhyme schemes and relaxed delivery that helped made “Earl” so mesmerizing become the foundation of “Doris.” Earl stretches his lines over multiple bars, creating impressively complex verses that nevertheless sound almost pedestrian in his characteristically laidback delivery. On “Whoa,” Earl’s verses shine brightest as he threads such incredibly written brainteasers as “Too pretentious to pretend like he could lose with spitting / Streaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms.” By the time he drawls, “Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick, thaw it out / Toss it right back like a vodka fifth,” Earl is downright boasting—he’s already won our forgiveness.
 
Like most releases by the radical hip-hop collective Odd Future, “Doris” predominantly features Odd Future members and close collaborators, with mixed results. On both “20 Wave Caps” and “Knight,” Domo Genesis’s upbeat delivery provides a foil to Earl’s verses, and on “Hive,” Vince Staples sounds venomous as he opens, “Quit with all that tough talk, bro, we know you niggas ain’t about shit / Come around, we gun them down, bodies piled, Auschwitz.” On “Sunday,” Frank Ocean delivers poignant line after poignant line, coming to an emotional apex with, “What good is west coast weather if you’re bipolar? / If I’ma need this sweater, I’d rather be where it’s cold, where it snows, and see how it goes.”
 
Not all the features on “Doris” are successful. A couple tracks are buoyed by Earl’s lyricism and little else, such as “Guild,” which features a vapid verse by Mac Miller over an uninspiring beat produced by Earl himself. On “Whoa,” Tyler, the Creator spends half of the hook spelling “GOLF WANG,” which makes his feature pale in comparison to Earl’s verses.
 
Although polarizing, Odd Future’s discography has made it clear that their music comes before the opinions of both fans and critics—“Doris” is no exception. Upon his return from Samoa, Earl tweeted that “I anticipate a loss of fans [upon releasing ‘Doris’].” This unusually candid assertion will probably hold true, but only because his two albums were written for completely different reasons: whereas “Earl” looked to horrify, “Doris” seeks redemption.

Saturday brought beards, and Sunday brought Boston Strong tank tops. This past weekend’s Boston Calling music festival drew a diverse crowd to City Hall Plaza to see acts ranging in genre from folk to trap, continuing the success its earlier incarnation had in May. Setting aside less important things, like problem sets and readings, a friend and I hopped on the Red Line on Saturday and Sunday in order to spend several hours listening to what Boston Calling had to offer.
A major difference this time around was the organizers’ decision to group similar artists by day: Sunday’s lineup was largely synthy and danceable, while Saturday’s was more guitar-heavy and subdued. This was a fantastic choice. There’s something to be said for variety, but there’s a lot more to be said for not making people sit through music they don't like. 
 
Saturday
 
We arrived midway through the Airborne Toxic Event’s set, and fortunately, it was all uphill from there. The California quintet has produced very few songs worth performing—but even if its songwriting abilities improved, its sonically muddled and clichéd live show wouldn’t do those songs any favors. 
Mercifully, it soon came time for Natasha Khan, a.k.a. Bat for Lashes, to take the stage on the opposite end of the plaza. Khan waltzed onstage in typically ornate garb—seeing her ankle-length, rainbow skirt firsthand was almost worth the price of admission—and put on what might have been the best show of the day, blending stunningly powerful vocals and palpitation-inducing drums into a fantastic performance. Highlights of the set were a relentless rendition of “What’s A Girl To Do” from 2007’s “Fur and Gold,” as well as the emotional piano ballad “Laura,” off this year’s “The Haunted Man.” 
As Bat For Lashes’ set ended, we rushed over to join the quickly forming sea of flannel gathering in anticipation of Local Natives. Following a surprise introduction by Mayor Thomas M. Menino, the Los Angeles quartet launched into a superb set. No one would ever call their studio recordings “ferocious,” but that’s exactly what their performance was on Saturday. Vocalist Kelcey Ayer provided extra rhythmic force by beating on a second set of drums throughout the set, which ranged from a gritty cover of the Talking Heads’ “Warning Sign” to the extended version of the band’s first single, “Sun Hands,” that closed the set.
 We half-listened to the penultimate band of the night, New Jersey’s the Gaslight Anthem. By this point, most of the festival’s crowd wasn’t watching the Gaslight Anthem. Instead, they had migrated across the plaza in order to get as close to the stage as possible for Vampire Weekend, due to take the stage in an hour. Considering that the Gaslight Anthem’s generic brand of heartland punk sounds the same at 500 feet away as it does it 50, the fans had the right idea.
Ezra Koenig and crew were well worth the wait. Vampire Weekend’s set was a constant stream of highlights: Koenig’s fleeting but furious guitar solos during “Cousins,” the crowd frenetically belting out “Nobody knows what your future holds / And it’s bad enough just getting old” at the end of opener “Diane Young,” and the grooving, fragmented melodies of “Diplomat’s Son.” Vampire Weekend also catered to the local crowd with two Massachusetts-themed songs: the early B-side “Ladies of Cambridge” and their final song of the night, “Walcott.” I had wanted to hear “Walcott” performed live for a long time, and it exceeded every expectation: Rostam Batmanglij’s rapid-fire keyboard part slowly unfolded into a torrential climax that sent everyone in the audience home both thrilled and exhausted.
 
Sunday
 
 Just like on Saturday, Sunday’s high point came early in the day, with a magnificent set by the Australian electronic musician Flume, who captivated the crowd with a nonstop stream of woozy, deconstructed head-nodders. Flume was also the one musician to pair his music with an interesting visual show: as his soulful songs were filtered through the speakers at insane volumes, the audience was treated to images of televisions and cars exploding, as well as short loops of pop videos. 
 After a solid performance by Solange, who trotted out her now-old-but-still-fantastic cover of the Dirty Projectors’ “Stillness is the Move,” the glorified house party DJs Flosstradamus took the stage. The duo’s set might have been tolerable if they hadn’t stopped the music so frequently to interject comments like “Where my fucking twerk team at today?” and “Fuck Miley Cyrus, y’all know who run this twerk shit!”
 The technically skilled and, more importantly, completely silent house DJ Wolfgang Gartner came as a welcome respite following Flosstradamus. The Californian mixed Daft Punk-inspired synths into a build-it-up-and-drop-the-bass pattern that’s been done before, but rarely with such precision. Following Gartner’s set, I made the decision to stay at that stage to be up front for Kendrick Lamar, meaning I had to listen to an almost absurdly energetic performance by dancehall sensations Major Lazer from a great distance. 
 But it was worth it. Kendrick Lamar’s technical skill is something to behold in person, best exhibited at the festival by his precise and passionate performance of “I Am (Interlude)” from his 2009 self-titled EP. To be fair, though, Kendrick’s showmanship skills could still use a little fine-tuning; for example, he needs to come up with a different method for hyping up the crowd than the elementary school assembly-esque “Which side of the audience is louder?” he used 10 times throughout the course of his hour-long set. 
 Passion Pit made a lot of very cold tank top-wearers wait for their performance, which turned out to be a slight disappointment after Vampire Weekend’s magnificence in the same slot the night before. Live, the Cambridge natives seemed to lack the rhythmic precision that makes their studio recordings so catchy. However, it was still an enjoyable performance, albeit one that probably would have been even more fun in a much smaller venue.
 As it continues to gain a reputation as a well-organized music festival, Boston Calling will only get better, with its third installment presumably coming next May. You might want to wait to buy those plane tickets home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
This evening I picked up a copy of The Crimson and was startled to see on the front page a “colorful” pie chart showing the “ethnicity” of recruited athletes in the class of 2017. My immediate, gut reaction was: That’s racist. After actually reading the article, I agreed with myself.
What logical reason is there to put that pie chart front and center?  Recruited athletes are a small part of Harvard’s student body; why do they warrant their own pie chart dissecting their “ethnicity?”  (“Black” is not an ethnicity, by the way.)  All the other infographics are based on 100 percent of the student body. After all, the article is supposedly about the entire class of 2017. That pie chart alone applies to a very small portion of the incoming class.
Furthermore, it seems irresponsible to write this front-page story without using proper methodology in the way you administered your survey and printed its “results.” The article said 80 percent of the class “responded” to the survey, but the number of completed surveys was not reported. I don’t know what the survey sent out by The Crimson looked like, but based on the “statistics” reported in the article, it seems like some leading or biased questions may have been asked. For example, I’d like to know what questions were asked to arrive at this formulation:  “Students who went to public high school were more likely than their private school counterparts to say they intend to seek out careers in education or health 10 years after graduation, and private school students were disproportionately attracted to eventual work in business, finance, and arts, sports, or entertainment.” What are the reasons for and implications of this “10 years after graduation,” “eventual work” language?
Lastly, you said only three recruited athletes said they were homosexual, bisexual, questioning, or other.  If you felt the need to include this information, perhaps it would have been more responsible to remind readers that only three of the recruited athletes who actually completed the survey said they were not heterosexual.
What is this survey even supposed to be about? There is the racial and sexual orientation aspect, the bizarre “expected payroll” aspect (“Hey, prefrosh! Are you gonna make $49,000 or $51,000 in 2021?” Those questions seem more like a psych survey than one attempting to profile a class), and other strange and arbitrary statements about birth order and career paths. Please use more rigorous methodology and responsible reporting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a mixture of envy and pity, I watch you doe-eyed freshmen checking both sides of the street before sauntering across Mass Ave, lanyards jingling, still wet behind the ears with the dew of youth. I watch from my lonely park bench, as I feed breadcrumbs out of a crumpled bag to the squirrels. As I wearily enter my fourth and final year, a whole 36 months your elder, I have gained some hard wrought wisdom. This now doddering senior has once run primal scream, committed to a thesis, lived in two houses, quit my thesis, survived CS50, recommitted to a thesis, and visited the quad. So, if you have a moment, listen to the wisdom of this world-wizened senior.
Make friends. Don’t conform.
Did you miss it? You were probably expecting a lot more than two sentences, four words, and seven morphemes. (Count them, future English concentrators, I dare you.) My advice is brief but brevity is the soul of wit. Now let me pedantically explain why in 550 words.
As to the first bit about making friends, it’s no hackneyed coincidence that most seniors will tell you they learned the most from their peers. It’s backed up by facts! Well, statistics at least. (Sorry, future statistics concentrators.)
People made a big hullaballoo this summer when Forbes ranked Harvard only the eighth best school in the country. Looking at their methodology, however, I was delighted. Why? Because Forbes ranks schools based solely on their output, not input like most rankings. More specifically, Forbes discounts the talents that get you in to Harvard and only measures what you get out. Subsequently, while the dip in our ranking may be the cause for disappointment in some, I find it incredibly inspiring. When you factor in the amount of talent that gets students in to Harvard, we rise seven spots as the foremost college in the country. In other words, only with the preexisting talents of its students is Harvard the most illustrious school in the country.
So this means—make friends. Harvard is the preeminent university we all know it to be only because of the people it admits.
As for the second bit about not conforming, that’s trickier. In fact, at times it is at odds with making friends. But it is complimentary with the notion that Harvard’s greatest asset is its human capital.  Since this advice is somewhat contradictory, it implies there is a careful equilibrium to maintain between being accommodating and uncompromising.
Conformity is antithetical to diversity. Diversity of background, interests, and opinions is a tremendously advantageous resource at Harvard. But diversity exists only so long as people refuse to conform. Furthermore, the most general and most important type of diversity is also the most susceptible to conformity: the diversity of thought.
Conformity is often confused with growth. People advise you to “grow.” But “growth” is greatly context specific. For example: “I feel like I really grew from the experience,” vs. “Oh, don’t mind that thing on my leg, it’s just a growth.”  So grow carefully. In fact, sometimes you should do the opposite; develop like a sculpture. Life can be just as much about eliminating options as about creating them. Don’t erode however. Each abrasion should be deliberate rather than the result of any external or involuntary corroding influence. Make sure to grow as though through osmosis—from greater to lesser, from higher concentration to lower (specifically concentrations of solvent, for the nitpicky future Chemistry concentrators).
Now, because I couldn’t resist, here are some random bits of advice I’ve picked up here and there which you might find useful.
Carry gum with you. It’s an easy way to make quick friends with that cute guy in the second row. I recommend Juicy Fruit—it’s suggestive. Wander around the textbooks in the Coop. When a cluster of book titles catches your eye, you might want to take that class.Learn one interesting fact from all departments and you’ll never be caught off guard when talking to a cute girl with a joint concentration in Folk and Mythology and Astrophysics. If you get the literary reference in the title, an English concentration might serve you well. Also take any course with Professor Gordon Teskey.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, it’s nearly 4:30, Jeopardy’s almost on, and I’m headed to a dinner of chicken noodle soup, seltzer water, and medication.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten years ago, in response to student activism, Harvard created the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. Three years later, after student demands, it inaugurated the modern Harvard College Women’s Center. Most recently, just two years ago, Harvard funded the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, also in response to organized student outcry. Today, these offices all do important work on campus, filling gaps in student life programming and representation that were undoubtedly felt keenly before. However, they also force students to address a difficult question: How much of feminist and queer work on campus can be done from within the institution?
Historically, Harvard students have organized in multifarious ways around queer issues on campus. The Queer Resource Center is a student-run safe and useful space for queer students. Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever interrogates the intersection of queer and of color identities; BAGELS, a group that I’m part of, interrogates the intersection of queer and Jewish identities. Queer Students and Allies traditionally organizes queer-friendly dance parties as well as political campaigns on and off-campus. The Trans Task Force addresses issues for trans* students, faculty, and staff. Informal coalitions of students regularly gather to address such issues as the return of ROTC to Harvard and its implication for the queer community, or the inappropriate nature of the former freshman-year sexual assault training, “Sex Signals.” These groups all banded together three years ago to demand that the University provide more resources for queer students, a call that resulted in the creation of an Office of BGLTQ Student Life in spring of 2012.
In the past year, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life (which students have started calling the Quoffice) has filled an important space on campus by organizing mixers, open houses, and panel discussions for students, and trainings and discussion spaces for student leaders and University administrators. Before the Office of BGLTQ Student Life instituted jobs for interns each semester, I don’t think there was any regular student employment doing work around queer issues on campus. And perhaps most fundamentally, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life presents itself to the Harvard community as a part of the administration open to addressing concerns about queer life on campus, a first place to turn to for students and workers who encounter problems with University Health Services, lack of gender-neutral housing options, or other forms of discrimination.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life is strong because it is an institutional part of Harvard, a division of the Office of Student Life with regular funding, space, and a seat at the table in administrative discussions. But it is also weak because it is an institutional part of Harvard. As a queer student, I would feel uncomfortable if the only voice for queer student life came from the Harvard administration.
Feminists on campus have had to negotiate the boundaries between institutionally sanctioned and grassroots feminist organizing for years. The Harvard College Women’s Center provides a funding source for student organizations doing programming around gender, a safe space in Harvard Yard for people of all genders to drink free coffee and pick up condoms, and some programming during Women’s Week and throughout the year about women’s and gender issues on campus. But it is up to student groups like the International Women’s Rights Collective, Manifesta Magazine, and the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign to critique the University’s sexual assault policy, to look at issues faced by women workers on campus, to speak out against final clubs, and, perhaps most importantly, to provide a space for feminist students to learn that grassroots organizing can successfully make change.
Similarly, the existence of an Office of BGLTQ Student Life should not negate the importance of student organizing and advocacy around queer issues on campus. In fact, it may even make student organizing easier: The QSA now need not worry about organizing the queer student meet-and-greets that are important to creating first-year community, and can instead focus its energies on grassroots queer political work and campaigning.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life can only do so much in a year—but it can also only do so much to challenge the power structure and norms of a University. The QSA, GLOW, BAGELS, TTF, and the QRC must not become simply the student arm of the Quoffice. This is not to say that they’ve all done so—but if my experience is at all representative, queer student groups are grappling with this question, whether implicitly or explicitly. Of course, this problem is not unique to the queer community: When Harvard responds to student calls for a Latina/o student center, Latina/o student groups may face the same conundrum. But I think the boundary between institution and bottom-up organizing is especially salient for the queer community: After all, queer politics is a politics of critique.
Harvard’s queer community certainly benefits from an institutional voice. But the creation of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life requires queer students and student groups to negotiate their relationship to the Office and to Harvard. I’d like to ask my fellow queer students to think critically about how we can appreciate the Quoffice for the work it does, and ensure that it’s not the be-all-end-all of queer organizing on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School may not be an investment bank, but it has never been a stranger to the deep, amorphous, and stubborn biases that operate in the worlds of business and finance.
It is for this reason that we commend the work done at HBS to address the inequality faced by a group of students particularly affected by traditional attitudes in the business world: women.
According to a New York Times report, several years ago, business school administrators decided to confront the institution’s gender imbalance head-on, enacting policies aimed at reducing the gap between female students and professors and their male counterparts. They coached junior female faculty members, brought in stenographers to prevent gender-biased grading, and emphasized collaborative approaches to learning in lieu of the characteristically severe case-study method. The reforms were unambiguously successful, closing the academic performance gap and improving female teachers’ evaluations.
HBS’s reformers did not assign themselves an easy task—barriers to female success in conventionally male domains are often difficult to define and deeply entrenched. For example, the business school classroom is one in which confidence is crucial for the appearance of competence. But that confidence can be difficult to muster—even for the most intelligent and capable of women—when lurking is a fear of confirming a negative stereotype (say, about women’s mathematical acuity) or of being perceived as aggressive (or worse).
The experiment’s pioneers deserve all the more credit for being “unapologetic,” an eventual buzzword adopted by one administrator, and proceeding in the face of certain resistance. Indeed, that some male students considered the experiment “painful”—an exercise in “social engineering,” or a return to primary school—should alert us to the fact that the success of the HBS program within the context of the larger business community is yet to be seen. Though armed with higher grades and additional accolades, Harvard’s female MBAs graduating in 2013 still entered an environment in which only 21 Fortune 500 CEOs are women. Most will be paid less than their former male classmates and many will experience sexual harassment in the workplace.
Given such an imbalance, we encourage other institutions (Harvard Law School and the College, to name just two) to emulate HBS. Policies perceived as handholding will do little to alter skeptics’ views of women’s abilities. As such, we note the importance of nuanced reform: sensitive, of course, to female students’ concerns, but careful not to inadvertently stigmatize them further.
It seems, however, that HBS’s reformers struck the right balance. It may be quite a while before having two X chromosomes is not an impediment to making six figures. But if the institution that incubates many future influential businesspeople can achieve and, hopefully, sustain real progress for female students, we’ve good reason to believe that a rise in their standing throughout the professional sphere is possible.

It is a natural, perhaps inevitable reaction, when confronted with news of a star, to try to bask in his or her reflected light. “Noted Irish poet had long and deep ties to Harvard,” went the subtitle to an article in the Harvard Gazette, published upon the death of Seamus Heaney last week. The Boston Globe, in turn, entitled its obituary “Seamus Heaney, 74; Nobel-winning poet, taught at Harvard.” 
Heaney’s relations with Harvard were, in fact, quite intimate. They stretched across 25 years and included various academic appointments, from visiting professor to poet-in-residence, a position he retained until 2006. But Harvard itself had little to do with Heaney’s development as a poet—instead it heralded and helped cultivate his status as a public intellectual. 
“I put my executive self in charge,” Heaney once said of his time at Harvard to fellow Irish poet Dennis O’Driscoll, in a series of interviews published in 2008 as “Stepping Stones.” From poetry workshops and speeches to dinner parties at Elizabeth Bishop’s, Cambridge seemed to foster and welcome Heaney’s personality to a greater degree than his poetry. 
He first arrived at Harvard in the spring of 1979 as a guest lecturer in the English department. Robert Lowell had died in 1977, and Elizabeth Bishop had just retired (according to rumors, encouraged to retire once she reached 65), leaving a gap among the faculty’s ranks. Heaney was offered a position teaching poetry workshops in the spring. It was a tempting offer that gave him the other eight months of the year to write, though it would require leaving behind his wife Marie and their three young sons—a decision with which Heaney struggled. 
The night before the decision was due, the poet had a dream: He was in a desert, night approaching, when he glimpsed a lean-to next to a cliff, a place to take refuge for the night. In the next morning’s light he realized he wasn’t on a cliff at all, but had lain down next to the dark helm of a ship on the banks of the Suez Canal. It was “a counsel of boldness,” he would tell O’Driscoll, “a reminder that what looks safe and settled isn’t necessarily so.”
Heaney’s arrival, though, was eased by his acquaintance with Professor Helen Vendler, whom he had gotten to know at several events and conferences throughout the 1970s, and who took him under her wing, beginning a friendship that would last until Heaney’s death.
His first lunch was at Bartley’s, with English professor Monroe Engel, then in charge of the creative writing workshops. He settled comfortably into Cambridge life, browsing its bookstores, enjoying the ride along Storrow Drive, frequenting the restaurant One Potato, Two Potato on Mass Ave., spending afternoons in Lamont’s Woodberry Poetry Room. By 1984, Heaney had a regular gig as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory, along with a room of his own in Adams House’s I-entryway.
Heaney wrote barely anything while in Cambridge. One of the few published fragments that remains is from a villanelle he wrote for Harvard’s 350th anniversary:
Begin again where frosts and tests were hard. 
Find yourself or founder. Here, imagine 
A spirit moves, John Harvard walks the yard, 
The books stand open and the gates unbarred.
But, as the countless obituaries of the last week have signaled, Heaney was always more than a poet—he occupied a role increasingly rare today: that of a poet whose voice was welcomed beyond his verse in the major political and cultural conversations of his day. It’s difficult to think of another writer whose translation of a thousand-year-old epic in Old English could remain on the New York Times bestseller list for weeks.
Heaney embraced this role as a public intellectual while at Harvard. Lectures and talks were common during the months he spent here, on campus and throughout the Square. He was a regular at the apartment Elizabeth Bishop shared with her longtime partner Alice Methfessel, or at Bishop’s home in Boston Harbor, or at Helen Vendler’s for dinners in Brookline.
Heaney’s poetry tended to cleave closely to the settings and themes of his native Ireland, and while he immersed himself in the intellectual life of Cambridge, American society alternately intrigued and repelled him. “America in the eighties seemed like an immense hovercraft,” he told O’Driscoll, “buoyant on its own prosperity and trust in the future.” American poets like John Ashbery proved unsatisfying to him then, seeming to match the “uncannily insulated, materially comfortable, volubly docile condition of a middle-class population on the move between its shopping malls and its missile silos.” 
Even so, Heaney often remarked that he found comfort and familiarity in the rural heritage of Harvard Yard, in the fact that John Harvard’s father had been in the cattle trade in Stratford, England, that the original academic building was located next to the Newtowne (later Cambridge) livestock sheds. Heaney’s childhood on a farm in Bellaghy, Ireland seemed to pursue him, even into a modern New England university. Ireland would remain his material and intellectual home, even as Cambridge helped fashion Heaney into a literary star whose poetry and persona would stretch worldwide.

While the River Houses typically gain notoriety for their cockroach infestations, Pforzheimer House drew crowds Tuesday looking to familiarize themselves with the Quad’s own indigenous insects: honeybees. 
A collaboration between several Harvard and Cambridge-based organizations, Tuesday’s Bee Day at Harvard was an all-day celebration of honeybees and their sweet byproduct. The event included local honey samples, tours of hives, and a joint screening and presentation on ongoing bee research.
Bee Day marked the first official event of a busy fall season for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. With Bee Day, HMSC launched an agenda of book talks, speaker series, and interactive museum tours with Harvard professors as a part of its mission to make Harvard’s resources—both material and intellectual—more accessible to the Cambridge community at large.
“The museums are one of Cambridge’s biggest tourist attractions,” said Blue Magruder, director of communications for HMSC. “The museums and these events are a wonderful portal into what’s going on at the University.”
The attempt to open Harvard to the public manifested in several tours of Harvard’s hives, which are offered by the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers Club. The group facilitated the visits and lent an enthusiastic undergraduate voice to the day’s celebration. 
“There are tons of reasons to love bees,” said Sarah E. Callan ‘14, a member of the organization. “Seeing another organism be social like humans is beautiful, but it’s just one of the remarkable things about bees.”
In addition to attracting the interest of undergraduates, bees have also caught the eye of some of Harvard’s biologists and health researchers who have recently directed their focus to the buzzing insect. 
The evening program included a screening of “More Than Honey,” a documentary on the ecological dangers of declining bee populations. The screening was followed by a presentation from Chensheng A. Lu, professor at Harvard School of Public Health. 
Given the central importance of bees to many elements of human society—ranging from their pollination of many main food items to production of wax and honey to their role in the ecosystem—we must “raise awareness and push for the protection of honeybees,” Lu said. “What if one day we don’t have enough bees to pollinate our food?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An NCAA rankings metric that assesses the academic performance of collegiate athletic programs recently gave six of Harvard’s varsity teams, including men’s basketball, scores below the average for those programs at other private institutions.
The Academic Progress Rate rankings, which were released by the NCAA this past June, are calculated out of 1000 points and measure the performance of individual varsity athletic teams based on a four-year rolling average of data submitted by each institution. The data considered in this year’s rankings covers the four seasons from 2008-2009 through 2011-2012.
Harvard men’s basketball registered the school’s lowest four-year average score, and five other teams—men’s skiing, men’s tennis, men’s wrestling, women’s skiiing, and women’s tennis—checked in with four-year scores lower than the average for their respective programs at private institutions.
For the 2011-2012 season individually, the team registered a score of 925, 27 points below the four-year average for Division I men’s basketball programs and 43 points below the four-year average for private institutions.
Aside from the six teams with below-average APR scores, Harvard’s programs generally fared well in the rankings. Fifteen Harvard teams—three men’s and 12 women’s—received perfect single-year APR scores of 1000 for the 2011-2012 school year.
Tim Williamson, the Harvard Athletics Department communications director, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s teams are “in full compliance” with the Ivy League’s academic standards.
“Harvard has maintained our high academic standards for all students and student athletes,” he wrote. “We are proud of the many contributions that Harvard’s student athletes make to our vibrant learning community while on campus and to our society after they graduate.
Harvard’s Athletics Department also expects the men’s basketball team’s APR score to change in next year’s rankings, which will assess the four seasons from 2009-2010 through 2012-2013.
“An early calculation of the APR for next year indicates a perfect or near perfect score for our men’s basketball team, reaffirming the program’s continued commitment to academic achievement,” Williamson wrote.
According to the NCAA’s website, the APR rankings take into account “the eligibility and retention of each student-athlete, each term.”
APR scores are also used to determine a team’s eligibility for postseason participation. Beginning in the 2012-2013 season, teams were required to score a minimum 900 four-year average or a 930 two-year average to compete in the postseason. The limits will increase in 2014-2015 to a 930 four-year average or a 940 two-year average, and teams will not be able to compete in the postseason with a four-year average lower than 940 beginning in 2015-2016.

The Ivy League Digital Network, a new online network that livestreams athletic contests from all eight Ivy League schools, premiered this past weekend with the showing of 23 live events.
The league partnered with NeuLion—a company which offers digital video broadcasting services—to create the channel and will deliver the content on the NeuLion College Platform. The platform operates with more than 175 colleges, universities, and conferences across the nation.
“NeuLion was chosen, out a field of several possible streaming companies, due to their advanced streaming technology base,” Halevi wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Their ability to use that technology [will] improve the viewing experience for our fans.”
Harvard announced its participation in the network in July, seven months after hiring Imry Halevi as the first-ever director of multimedia and production.
The University’s channel features content for desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
In January, Halevi wrote in an email to The Crimson that one goal of the new department was to make the University’s online streaming technologies “on the same level as the best college streams of the country.”
Since that announcement, Halevi has written that the department has moved closer to that goal.
“We are now in a position to produce streams at the highest possible quality,” Halevi wrote in an email to The Crimson in July.
These new initiatives include filming more athletic events, improved high-definition quality, and a new graphics package.
“Everyone at Harvard Athletics is excited for the launch,” Halevi wrote. “We’ll be providing a state-of-the-art way for all our fans to follow the Crimson if they cannot come to games.”
The Harvard channel will be offered in a variety of subscription packages, ranging from one-day passes to full-year packages. In addition to single-school subscriptions, fans will also be able to purchase subscriptions covering all eight Ivy League schools.
“We are excited for the opportunity to showcase Harvard Athletics on the new Ivy League Digital Network,” said Tim Williamson, director of athletic communications, in an interview with GoCrimson.com this July. “With expanded production capabilities, more camera angles, better replays, and high definition quality, this partnership will allow us to enhance the access of our fans, alumni, student body, and overall Harvard community to our athletic program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two undefeated seasons and back-to-back gold medals at EARC Sprints and IRA National Championships, the Harvard Men’s Lightweight Crew program was not looking to change their winning formula.  But, due to shifts in coaching staff across the Harvard rowing program, the Crimson lightweights will be welcoming a new head coach for the 2013-2014 season, former Radcliffe Lightweight Women’s head coach Michiel Bartman.
“I think the University hired a good coach,” assistant lightweight coach Linda E.  Muri said.  “He has a lot of international experience as an oarsman and he raced for the Netherlands. He’s a three time Olympic medalist.”
Longtime heavyweight coach Harry Parker passed away in June, leaving behind big shoes for the Harvard rowing program to fill.  Parker coached at Harvard for 52 years, revolutionizing the sport and changing the norms of collegiate rowing.  During his time as head coach of the Crimson heavyweights, he led the team to 22 undefeated regular seasons, 24 titles at EARC Sprints and 16 official and unofficial national championships.  Parker died at age 77 after a two-year struggle with myelodysplastic syndrome, a kind of blood cancer.
Parker’s death set in motion a shift in personnel throughout all dimensions of the program, affecting men and women, heavyweights and lightweights alike.  Charley Butt was appointed to fill Parker’s place after serving as the men’s lightweight coach for the past 28 years.  During Butt’s time with the lightweights, the Crimson achieved 25 winning dual season records, 15 Eastern titles and nine IRA National Championships.
While the Harvard heavyweights gained a new coach, the lightweights lost one. The program conducted a national search, but once again pulled from within to fill the position, appointing an accomplished oarsman and former lightweight women’s coach in Bartman.
“It’s a very exciting new challenge,” Bartman said. “On one hand, I’m sad that I will no longer be with the lightweight women… But, the move to the lightweight men was good for me on certain personal levels.  One of them was the new heavyweight men’s coach, Charley Butt. I’ve known him for 20 years and we’ve shared a lot of ideas about rowing, talking about technique or approaching certain things and we have become personal friends.  It was for me a great way to start to work together.”
A native of the Netherlands, Bartman won a gold medal in the Dutch men’s eight in the 1996 Olympics.  Before coming to Harvard, Bartman coached many athletes at Vesper Boat Club who participated in World Rowing Championships and the Olympics.  When Bartman arrived at Harvard, he worked to transform the struggling women’s lightweight program.
“When I got here with the lightweight women, I started in a different way because they were ranked lower than they are ranked now,” Bartman said. “I had to rebuild the program. With the lightweight men, they have been undefeated for the past two seasons and it’s a very strong team, so I want to hold onto the good things and introduce new things.”
As for the team’s goals this season:
“The main word for this year is going to be ‘three-peat,’” Bartman said, referring to the team’s desire to go undefeated and win gold at EARC Sprints and IRA National Championships for a third straight year.
The one lingering question is how Bartman’s appointment will affect the lightweight women, whose program thrived under his leadership.
“The day after I found out that I got the job, the Radcliffe coaches immediately stepped up,” Bartman said. “For example, Kathy Keeler, who is the late wife of Harry Parker, [came]  down to the boat house to offer her help. There is definitely some disturbance in the programs but I think one of the things that we do well is [draw] great support from everybody.”
Despite the changes in the program, Muri remains confident that Harvard rowing will have a successful season across the board.
“The students and so, therefore, the oarsmen at Harvard are very motivated, driven people, so I think they are going to respond to the good coaching regardless of who it is,” Muri said. “I think there will be changes but I don’t think there will be a drop off in success.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team returns home from California to duke it out against New Hampshire in its first home game Wednesday night. The Crimson is coming off of a weekend tournament during which the squad dropped two games against California and San Francisco. The two losses, however, have not dampened Harvard players’ confidence.
“In California we learned that we are a really strong team, and when we come out on the field we are ready to play to win,” co-captain Lizzy F. Weisman said. “I think that will give us what we need coming into this first game.”
The Crimson has dominated the Wildcats in the past, with an overall record of 20-2-3.  While Harvard has yet to tally a win thus far, the Crimson has not dropped a game to New Hampshire (1-4-1) in its past eight matchups.
Roster depth ranks among Harvard’s strengths heading into its opening home game at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
“We have depth in every position, so when we’re subbing we aren’t losing any skill,” Weisman said. “We’re really not losing anything by subbing. We’re just kind of switching people out and giving people a break. We’re just strong all around throughout the team.”
The team’s depth can be attributed in part to the nine new freshmen on the squad.
“The freshmen are doing really well,” said sophomore forward Lauren Varela who netted the Crimson’s lone goal this past weekend. “I think we are really coming together and will be a great team this year… I’m obviously excited for everyone to see our new team.”
So far five freshmen have played in the Crimson lineup, with defender Bailey Gary, forward Midge Purce, and forward Karly Zlatic earning starting spots.
Freshmen talent is not exclusive to Harvard’s roster, however—Wildcats freshman Kirsten O’Neil has tallied three points for New Hampshire, with one goal and two assists.
“New Hampshire is a great team,” Varela said. “I think we’re just trying to get better…  We’re just trying to connect as a team.”
Part of making that connection as a team is finding set formations for future games. Roster depth and versatility, though great assets, can make decisions on playing positions difficult.
“We’re really trying to nail down our formation,” Weisman said. “So, we’ve been trying out a few different things—that’s pretty much what we’ve been working on—figuring out where to put people and how everyone combines to play with each other… We have strength everywhere, but we’re still just trying to figure out really what formation we work well in and our strengths play into. I think the formation challenge is something we are working on.”
The Crimson also possesses a more seasoned coaching staff, with Head Coach Ray Leone beginning his seventh season, with his six previous all ending in winning records. The Wildcats recently hired new Head Coach Sam Lopes earlier this year.
Returning several key offensive and defensive players this season, Harvard’s roster is filled with familiar faces from previous years. Last year’s high-scorer, junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Camby, was named to the all-conference first team last season. Co-captains Weisman and senior midfielder Peyton Johnson also tallied an impressive 20 points combined for the 2012 season, including five goals from Weisman and five assists from Johnson.
The Crimson goalies include juniors Cheta Emba and Bethany Kanten as well as freshman recruit Lizzie Durack who was selected to the U20 England National Team. Emba and Kanten have registered three and five saves respectively, while Durack also saw playing time this past weekend.
After going 4-1-3 in home openers over the past eight years, Harvard players prefer to play on their own turf.
“We’re really excited to play at home in front of our home crowd,” Weisman said. “I think we’re all just really excited to show what we’ve been working on throughout preseason.”
The Crimson will play three games over the span of five days, hosting all three matches at home this week. Harvard will compete in its first Ivy League conference game of the season against UPenn at home on Sept 27th.
“We’re trying to get better every game,” Varela said. “Obviously we wanted two wins this weekend, but we improved from Friday to Sunday, and I think that’s what Coach [Leone] really wants us to do—keep getting better until Ivy League play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pair of opening weekend losses for the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-2-0) has done nothing to shake the confidence of the team heading into its Thursday game against Providence (3-0-1). Following a weekend in which the Crimson equaled its opponents in shots on goal at 14 apiece but came away with four fewer goals, senior midfielder Ross Friedman said that the team showed the potential for a potent offense in the losses.
“I think our shot count says that we created chances, and I thought that we were very dangerous [last weekend],” Friedman said. “I can see each game being completely different games if we had capitalized early. [On Thursday], it is going to be very small changes to our game plan and focus that are going to be the difference maker.”
Three years ago, the last time that the Crimson played the Friars, Harvard fell, 2-1, at Soldiers Field after two first-half goals put the Crimson in a hole they could not overcome. However, nearly none of the current Harvard team was on the field that day; only current seniors Friedman, Connor McCarthy, and Obiajulu Agha saw playing time against Providence.
This time around, Friedman said that the team will focus on the small parts of the game that make the difference between winning and losing. In both weekend games—a 3-0 Friday loss to Iona and a 2-1 Sunday loss to Davidson—late goals clinched the victory for the opposing teams.
Against Iona, with Harvard committing more and more men up the field to pursue an equalizing goal in the 79th minute, Iona midfielder Ignacio Magnato caught a through ball ahead of a scrambling defense and doubled the deficit with a rocket into the back of the net. A third Iona goal 90 seconds later put the game away. In Sunday’s game, the Crimson took an early second-half lead but gave up a second goal late. To correct these late lapses, Friedman said the team has focused on playing ninety solid minutes of soccer.
“A lot of the stuff happening at the end of the Davidson game was that we stopped talking because we got tired and our focus slowed,” Friedman said. “Finishing through the line and willing your way to win the game are big things. That was the difference maker last weekend.”
With the team beset by injuries early in the year—most notably senior midfielder Kyle Henderson being out for the year with a concussion—Friedman said that the freshmen class has stepped in and contributed immediately to the team. According to the senior, in their first games of their careers, rookies like forward Ashi Geberkidane, who scored the team’s only goal on Sunday, have played like seasoned veterans.
“I was very impressed to see how calm and composed they were in their first games,” Friedman said. “In a situation like that—where it is [both] a higher level game and more physical playing against guys three or four years older than them, how they focused and implemented their process to the game was impressive.”
Sophomore midfielder Michael Klain said that the new system of coach Pieter Lehrer has smoothed the transition for the younger players on the team. Klain said that the focus on the system and not the individual parts allows players to seamlessly transition in and out, as evidenced by the 18 different players who received playing time over the weekend.
“It is unfortunate that we have injury troubles, but we have a system where the focus is less on individuals and more on how we put the product together on the field,” Klain said. “As long as the individuals with less experience can focus on doing their part and not replacing anyone and on their role within the greater system, the task becomes easier for those guys.”
Within the system, Klain said that the game Thursday will serve as another benchmark for the team. Both he and Friedman emphasized that the process of improvement is very important to the team and that the final score is only one indicator of the team’s performance.
“We had two good opportunities [last week] to take step forwards and we think that we are a better team now than we were on Friday,” Klain said. “Those are a few of our strengths that we can apply tomorrow and we [can use] to get better every single day.”
“For us, everything is all about the process,” Friedman added. “Throughout the game, we are constantly thinking about our process, and [then] from that we begin to think about results.”

When it was announced that Justin Timberlake was to receive the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, rumors swirled that an 'N SYNC reunion was imminent. And it was with great excitement and anticipation that viewers watched Timberlake go back to his roots, even if it only lasted for a couple of minutes. 'N SYNC's reunion came in the wake of those of fellow fellow boy bands like the Backstreet Boys—who will play Boston on Saturday at MIXFest—and New Kids on the Block.
 
But would all '90s boy bands be welcomed back with open arms by the public? Here are some that should remain in obscurity for the sake of music:
 
B2K
Members: Omarion, Lil' Fizz, J-Boog, and Raz-B
Songs We Never Want to Hear Again: “Bump, Bump, Bump,” “Girlfriend” 
In the ’90s: While B2K’s R&B style was a welcome change from the pop boy bands we all know, the fact that they sang lyrics like “baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go bump bump bump” to what must have been predominantly young, female fans was disturbing.
Now: After B2K’s disbandment, lead-singer Omarion had a semi-successful solo career, which he currently continues with a new album slated for release this year. Omarion's moniker-challenged ex-bandmates have attempted solo careers and dabbled in movies and TV, but have remained under the radar.
 
Hanson
Members: Isaac, Taylor, and Zac Hanson
Song We Never Want to Hear Again: “MMMBop” 
In the ’90s: Hanson’s only hit was one of the most voracious earworms of the decade.
Now: Fifteen years later, people might still find themselves absentmindedly humming “MMMBop” and pretending it never happened. Hanson has managed to stay together since the band’s formation, but their new material has been absent from pop radio.
LFO
Members: Rich Cronin, Devin Lima, and Brad Fischetti
Songs We Never Want to Hear Again: “Summer Girls,” “Girl On TV” 
In the ’90s: One of life’s greatest mysteries is why this trio allegedly chose to shorten their original, ultra-hip band name, Lyte Funky Ones, into its three-letter acronym. LFO fused pop and hip-hop, effectively giving us the worst of both worlds.
Now: LFO reunited briefly in 2009 before breaking up once again.
 
98 Degrees
Members: Nick Lachey, Drew Lachey, Jeff Timmons, and Justin Jeffre
Songs We Never Want to Hear Again: “The Hardest Thing,” “I Do (Cherish You),” “Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche)” 
In the ’90s: The only thing worse than hearing 98 Degrees’ sappy ballads about love on the radio was hearing them try to set the mood by singing a few words in Spanish.
Now: Though Nick Lachey is currently working as a host for the reality show “The Winner Is,” 98 Degrees went on tour with fellow “man bands” NKOTB and Boyz II Men this past summer. Their latest album “2.0” debuted at #65 on the Billboard Top 200. This does not bode well for a comeback but it does bode well for those of us who prefer artists who are a little cooler.
 
BONUS:
 
 O-Town
Members: Ashley Parker Angel, Jacob Underwood, Erik-Michael Estrada, Trevor Penick, and Dan Miller
Songs We Never Want to Hear Again: “All Or Nothing,” “Liquid Dreams” 
In the Early 2000’s: MTV producers had no idea what they were about to unleash when they helped form O-Town via the reality show “Making the Band.” Luckily, the band only survived for a few years of churning out “soulful” Michael Jackson rip-offs before they broke up.
Now: The star of O-Town, Ashley Parker Angel, has gone into various ventures since the group’s disbandment, including a solo music career and acting in film and Broadway shows. So it was no surprise that he refused to join the other four members of the group for their 2011 reunion. The now four-member boy band hasn’t released any new material, so we’re safe for now.
 
What is the purpose of the Q&A section, and what kind of questions do you answer?
We at the Q&A are here for YOU.  We will take any question you have, any topic that you want to know  more about or anything that makes you anxious. We are here to answer any  and all questions you might have about Harvard, especially as we  recently went through these processes ourselves.
How can I submit my questions?
To submit your questions, simply type them into the question box on the right side of the page.
Should I take the SAT or the ACT?
Firstly,  you should check to see whether the schools you are applying to accept both exams. The  vast majority of American colleges do, including all the Ivy League  schools, Stanford, MIT, Caltech, and University of Chicago.
So, how do you decide?
The  tests vary slightly in their formats and content. The SAT is broken up  into 10 parts, first the essay and then the other nine, which are split up into math, critical reading, and writing categories. Many schools require that applicants supplement the SAT with at least one SAT II subject  test, which tests more specific knowledge in particular fields, including sciences and foreign languages.
The ACT, on the other hand, is broken up into four  longer sections—English, Math, Reading, and Science—with an  optional fifth section (Writing) which many colleges require.  The ACT tests science, unlike the SAT, and its math is typically a  little more advanced. Moreover, the ACT's questions are a little more  straightforward than the SAT's questions, which often feature complicated and convoluted phrasings.
What it comes down to is the format you are most  comfortable in. Some students prefer the SAT, some the ACT, and some  really don't have a preference. There are tests you can take—the PSAT  and the PLAN—that give you an indication of what your score would be  on the SAT and the ACT, respectively. You can compare your performance  on the ACTs vs the SATs using a conversion chart, such as the one  College Board provides here.
What is a college's "yield rate" and why is it important?
A  college's yield rate is the percentage of admitted students who eventually  decide to matriculate at a given university. The higher the yield rate,  the larger the number of students who chose it over other schools to  which they were accepted. Yield rate is important to colleges: among  other things, it affects their rankings.
They also have an effect on  you as an applicant: yield rates vary from year to year, and the higher the yield rate, the less need there is for a school to dip into the  waitlist to fill its class. Yield rate also helps to explain why some  colleges care about "demonstrated interest"—e.g. whether you have  gone on tours, visited, talked to admission officers, signed up for  booklets, etc. The more interest a person demonstrates in a school, it  is thought, the more likely a person is to say yes. There have even been allegations that some colleges reject highly-qualified students on the assumption that their  school is not the student's first choice, thereby improving their yield  rate.
 Should I visit the college campus even before I’ve been admitted? 
It is definitely a good idea to go visit a college, even in the application stage. By visiting a college early, you can see how the environment is, talk to students who attend to get a more realistic viewpoint on the college, and ask admissions officers about the process in person.
Visiting colleges before applying can be a good way to narrow down the pool of colleges you are applying to (if you are applying to many) or can help you understand how to gear your application towards a certain program or opportunity at the college.
Overall, visiting a college is a great way to figure out if you’d be happy at the college or not. There is more to a college than what can be written on a brochure, and sometimes that is what counts the most.
Read about what to do when you visit a college here.
Will this blog include anything for potential transfer students?
While we will mainly focus on freshman admissions, we also hope to feature some content aimed at transfer applicants.
