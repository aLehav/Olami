After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quarantine TV production is rough. Camera operators, lighting technicians, and set designers exist for a reason — it’s because that shit is hard. And when the actors are left to fend for themselves, it’s hard not to notice. Armed with iPhone cameras, makeshift tripods, and whatever they can dig out of their garages, our favorite stars are doing their best to provide viewers with the consistent content they need during this trying time — to varying degrees of success. (Weekend Update without a live audience feels a lot like watching an impassioned professor give a Zoom lecture to an entirely muted class.) This past week, one such group of stars — straight out of Pawnee, Indiana — joined the effort.
The cast of NBC’s 2009–2015 sitcom, “Parks and Recreation,” reunited for a one-off special April 30 to raise money for Feeding America. Partnering with State Farm and Subaru, the half-hour special brought us back into the lives of Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), and the rest of the Parks gang. Leslie, stuck at home during quarantine, is determined to stay connected to her friends (while also, in typical Leslie fashion, chairing multiple crisis response committees — “every little girl’s dream,” she says).
Using Gryzzl (the show’s Orwellian equivalent of Zoom), Leslie starts a phone tree to check in on all of her friends. Ben (Adam Scott) has started a screenplay for the claymation adaptation of “Cones of Dunshire.” Ann (Rashida Jones) is helping with outpatient care in Michigan. Chris (Rob Lowe) is donating blood four times a day because his blood type is, apparently, “just positive.” Tom (Aziz Ansari) is in full “treat yo’ self” mode in “Bali.” I could go on, but given how wonderfully idiosyncratic these many characters are, it would probably take quite a while.
Amidst the video chat check-ins, the producers scattered reminders of reality: nods to nurses and teachers, reminders to practice social distancing, and frequent messages from Leslie about the importance of mental and emotional health — as well as some non-pandemic-related updates for a show whose final episode aired over five years ago. Tom, for example, has taken up Fortnite, from which he’s learned that “children are terrifying and can make you cry almost immediately.”
It wasn’t a particularly ambitious piece of television; it suffered, understandably, from the same production shortcomings as all quarantine television does. A stationary iPhone camera doesn’t really allow for the body language or physicality or whimsy that is so integral to the original show’s charm. Lost are the sharp pans and zooms, fourth-wall-breaking camera glances, and interview-style asides. But that’s not what the special was about, anyways. It didn’t need to re-establish Pawnee and its weird quirks and oddities, it just needed to remind us of them.
And that was the name of the game: nostalgia. For a Parks and Rec virgin, I’m sure the special was reasonably enjoyable. For anyone who’s watched the show in its entirety — or in my case, five times over — it was an endless barrage of nostalgia-tapping references, jokes, and guest appearances. From the moment the special began (with a hilarious introduction from always-adorable Bobby Newport (Paul Rudd)) to the moment it ended (a heartfelt, inescapably tear-jerking rendition of “5,000 Candles in the Wind” from the entire cast), it felt like it was trying to cheer you up — like it was saying, “Hey, remember all these things and places and beloved characters that make you laugh? They all still exist! Here they are!”
And that reminder was, I think, its greatest contribution.
“When is this group of people ever going to be all together again?” Leslie asks, in the show’s season finale. “That’s all I want — all of these people together, in the same place, at the same time.”
It bothers me when people describe every new TV show or movie or album that comes out during quarantine as “the uplifting and inspiring piece of art that we need in this uncertain and trying time.” It really does. But as much as I hate to contradict myself, “Parks and Recreation” — the amazing, beautiful, funny show about kind people coming together to do good things for the world — is exactly that. Only Leslie Knope could have accomplished this impossible feat, bringing “all these people together, in the same place, at the same time,” and in the world we find ourselves in today, that’s exactly what we need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ASMR eating and Mukbang videos have become all the rage these past few years, and I am not ashamed to say that I have jumped on the bandwagon. ASMR, short for autonomous sensory meridian response, refers to the pleasant and often involuntary feeling viewers get from watching certain sensorily “stimulating” videos. You might have heard of the infamous ASMR pickle or honeycomb, foods with certain crispy or “squishy” qualities that have dominated the ASMR eating platform. Mukbang is similarly food-oriented, but instead focuses on the consumption of large quantities of food, often without as much attention to their aesthetic qualities.
Many do not understand the obsession with such a “sickening” trend. Amplified chewing and slurping sounds are not pleasant to the ear, and the devouring of large amounts of food in one sitting is not necessarily entertaining either. Furthermore, some even go so far as to accuse ASMR eaters and Mukbang creators of taking advantage of a lazy trend to make profits and expand their fan base. However, there’s a strong case to be made against these arguments.
The appeal of watching a stranger consume a tempting –– and almost always gargantuan –– mountain of food arranged in a deliberately delectable array is just part of the allure. The rainbow of sauces and varied textures of the food items themselves bring out the more visually enticing aspect of this trend, while the combinations of the individual food elements bespeak a creativity that attracts a large audience base. Cheesy ramen and donut fried-chicken sandwiches are not necessarily huge innovations, but it is nonetheless entertaining to watch content creators eat them, even if you yourself would not dare to venture near such bizarre creations.
ASMR and mukbang eating resembles an enhanced eating setting, often centered around a theme that is catered towards the audience’s tastes (pun intended). It is therefore not simply about eating, but also about the essence of the food itself and the method through which the content creator consumes what's in front of them. The most successful developers in this field must figure out an optimally engaging design for their videos — as is true in most other social media categories. It is a kind of artistic expression, one that is viscerally satisfying to viewers, much like other trends.
There is also a key distinction between ASMR-style eating videos and Mukbang videos that speaks to different ambitions within this trend. While ASMR eating usually caters more towards aesthetic elements, such as quality of visual, sound, and texture, Mukbang videos are usually more authentic in style — less scripted than other types of content found on YouTube –– and involve more speaking, with fewer amplified eating sounds, serving as an opportunity for creators to better acquaint themselves with their fans. Mukbang videos simulate meal-time conversation, even if the audience cannot respond directly back. Thus, viewers feel more comfortable with mukbangers, while at the same time also indirectly enjoying the sight of the food they are consuming.
In the same way, ASMR eating videos also allow viewers to savor the food palettes creators present, whatever their form may be: from edible makeup, to eating utensils, to diamond stilettos. ASMR, despite the presence of more radical interpretations of food –– of which even I am skeptical –– thereby grants viewers a way to enjoy strange food items they would probably never otherwise encounter. This novel method of appreciating food may say something about what is actually considered food and how it should be consumed, at least through the screen.
Strange as they may seem, Mukbang and ASMR eating videos are a valuable resource. Whether you have become bored with your current video recommendations, are looking for a new category to explore, or just have no means to eat some of your favorite snacks and are searching for a new way to still indulge in them, ASMR eating and Mukbang videos offer a great alternative that you can enjoy inside or out of quarantine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and its peer institutions recently came under fire for being eligible to receive millions in federal aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Members of Congress, President Donald Trump, and many others framed the discussion as a choice between the financial health of Harvard’s $41 billion endowment on the one hand and the jobs and lives of fellow Americans on the other.
But it is dangerous to argue that because Harvard is rich, it should not be worrying about its finances. As Harvard’s financial health deteriorates, the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of taxpaying Americans will also be harmed over the next few years. Although the short-term benefits of prioritizing more vulnerable institutions and individuals outweigh the long-term costs, these costs are real and need to be included in the discussion.
Even the $41 billion number, made public in June 2019, is misleading. There are serious legal and logistical hurdles involved in redirecting the more than 13,000 separate funds that make up the endowment for pandemic assistance. The vast majority of the endowment is restricted, and each fund must be individually renegotiated with the donor if the funds are to be repurposed. More importantly, Harvard’s financial health has taken a serious hit in the last few weeks. If the current economic downturn is “directly comparable” to the Great Recession, Harvard’s endowment may be posed to lose more than $10 billion.
But tens of billions of dollars is still a lot of money. That’s why more than a third of Harvard’s annual operating budget comes from endowment returns. For example, endowment returns funded 87 and 74 percent of the Radcliffe Institute and Harvard Divinity School operating budgets for 2019. At the same time that the endowment is plummeting, operating costs are increasing. Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is already unable to cover its budget for Fiscal Year 2020 due to $30 million in “unforeseen expenses and lost revenue.”
Therefore, like any other business still operating, the University will be forced to make drastic budget cuts across the board. Although the University is already cutting non-essential spending, there will almost certainly be hiring freezes and mass layoffs. For comparison, in the aftermath of the 2009 recession, Harvard reduced food services staffing, tabled faculty salary increases, froze hiring, and laid off hundreds of employees. These cuts over the next few years will threaten the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of Americans. The most vulnerable populations on campus — staff workers, graduate students trying to negotiate insurance benefits, and the 55 percent of undergraduates who depend on financial aid to afford tuition — will be the ones harmed the most. Every dollar Harvard loses today is two dollars it cannot spend to hire workers or fund scholarships down the line. And while costs will return to normal and Harvard’s endowment will eventually recover, it will take time — Harvard’s endowment didn’t recover to pre-2008 levels until 2017.
This doesn’t mean that we should prioritize wealthy corporations over struggling small businesses and communities. In fact, I completely agree with Harvard’s decision not to accept federal aid. But we need to recognize that Harvard’s decision will, without a doubt, hurt its ability to help its employees and students stay safe and put food on the table in five years.
The CARES Act won’t be the last time that we have to choose between the long-term financial health of wealthy institutions and the short-term wellbeing of fellow Americans. While it seems absurd to be thinking about how much money a nameless investment management company is making during a pandemic, we need to remember that the long-term financial health of universities such as Harvard directly affects the livelihoods of thousands of individuals — even if the consequences will not be apparent until later. This doesn’t mean we should bail out every wealthy company. Rather, we need to avoid knee-jerk reactions that equate wealth with excess and include the long-term costs of reduced financial health in our decision-making.

“Harvard will be open for fall 2020,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote to all Harvard affiliates last Monday. But looking more closely at this “important” and “clear” decision, uncertainty remains about which parts and schools of Harvard will be open, whether the opening will be online or on-campus, and when the fall semester will actually begin.
In the series of emails sent by the Provost, the Dean of the College, and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, we are made acutely aware of how “large and complex” Harvard is, how this generates “a great deal of uncertainty,” and how a chorus of administrators who are equally baffled are thankful for our help, patience, flexibility, commitment, creativity, and partnership.
We previously urged the University to be transparent about their decisions, asking administrators to “raise the bar for effective and frequent communication,” and we acknowledge and appreciate these efforts to communicate. But effective communications should not require deciphering and should not leave students with vastly different interpretations of what the University is thinking. We appreciate the complexity and uncertainty of the situation at hand, but communicating this problem does not require a hefty, cryptic email wrought with complexity and uncertainty that mirrors the broader situation. If the administrators know nothing other than that Harvard will operate at some — perhaps reduced — capacity next semester, then communicating that, and just that, suffices.
But more than just this communicative logjam, the emails missed out on a chance to do something substantive. While details about what a fall semester will look like are subject to changes in the course of the pandemic, there are principles that must be reasserted in the midst of uncertainty. In their emails, administrators — correctly — emphasized that the wellbeing and safety of our community is paramount, but they should have done more to address the specter of significant equity challenges that hang over the possibility of an online fall semester.
When the College announced an emergency universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading policy, Dean Gay cited “the apparent equity concerns” and the fact that the pandemic has, simply put, changed everything. Come next fall, these challenges will still be present, if not worsened by the evolving public health and financial crisis.
By posing the possibility of an online semester without acknowledging any of these challenges, these announcements wasted the opportunity to address them, and took it further by suggesting that improvements to an online environment could make it comparable to the real one. We remain convinced that no system, no matter how innovative and perfected an online education experience it may be, can make up for the central role that Harvard’s campus plays in our normal education. Being in the same place provides a level ground for all students to interactively learn from professors, graduate students, and each other. Whether it be one’s time zone, access to technology, mental and physical health, or living situation, there are few sufficient online substitutes.
In addition to our concerns about our educational experiences, this announcement also leaves in the air student concerns about financial aid and financial security. For students working on-campus jobs, especially for those who rely on them to support themselves, an online semester may mean the loss of essential income and the possibility of having their education put at risk. In light of another potentially chaotic and unfulfilling semester, the lack of official guidance about how financial aid measures will apply if students take voluntary leaves of absence remains concerning.
We hope the administration works to move beyond vague emails and a two-question survey whose value as a genuine inquiry into student opinion seems limited. As before, we insist that the administration should consult students in a more meaningful way and strive for greater clarity in its communications.

Harvard Law School announced Wednesday that public interest lawyer Bryan A. Stevenson will be the speaker for the Class of 2020’s virtual commencement ceremonies.
The Law School will host the celebration online Thursday, May 28, and plans to hold an on-campus ceremony on a later date.
Stevenson graduated from the Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School in 1985. He is the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit law organization focusing on human rights within the criminal justice system.
After attending the Law School, Stevenson worked as a staff attorney with the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta, where he defended individuals on death row throughout the South.
In 1989, he founded the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Ala. The Equal Justice Initiative aims to address issues such as mass incarceration and racial bias in the criminal justice system by defending individuals facing capital punishment, as well as juveniles prosecuted as adults. The initiative’s work has led to the release of more than 135 wrongly condemned individuals on death row.
Stevenson has won several cases before the United States Supreme Court, including a 2012 ruling that declared life sentences without parole for children under 17 years old to be unconstitutional.
He published his award-winning memoir, “Just Mercy," in 2014. The book demonstrates the racial bias in the criminal justice system through the stories of Stevenson’s clients and was adapted into a 2019 movie starring Michael B. Jordan.
Stevenson also helped create the Legacy Museum and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in 2018, which recount the story of slavery, lynching, and racial segregation in the United States and its legacy today.
Stevenson’s work has earned widespread recognition for improving the criminal justice system. He has received more than 40 honorary doctoral degrees from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Oxford University, among others. His work has also earned many awards, such as the National Medal of Liberty from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Olof Palme Prize for international human rights.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote that Stevenson has had a profound impact on vulnerable individuals in need of legal aid.
“Bryan Stevenson is a superb lawyer and a courageous and impactful advocate whose selfless work has changed the lives of countless people,” he wrote. “We are delighted to have him share his story and his perspective as we honor the Class of 2020.”
