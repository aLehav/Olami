After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less a tour-de-force sports drama than one man’s journey towards redemption and sobriety, “The Way Back” marks director Gavin O’Connor’s first sports film since his 2011 mixed martial arts drama, “Warrior” (2011).
This time — instead of Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton throwing hands in the octagon — Ben Affleck stars as Jack Cunningham, an ex-basketball star and grizzled alcoholic mourning the loss of his son, who is called on by his high school alma mater to coach their struggling basketball team to a state title.
Cunningham’s world is presented as melancholic through dim lighting and muffled sound design. The audio-visual monotony of the opening minutes immerses viewers in the colorless mire of Cunningham's addiction. Hammer rings against nail in a desolate construction yard where Cunningham works during the day. Rain hums against tile as Cunningham exits a liquor store. Chippy dialogue and colorful vulgarity ring through Cunningham's home, characteristic of his relationship with his sister Beth (Michaela Watkins).
Unfortunately, with Cunningham's addiction taking center stage throughout the film, other storylines and characters are largely neglected. Cunningham's return to basketball is motivated by an arbitrary necessity of plot and, as such, feels trite and unrealistic.
Upon arriving at Bishop Hayes High School, Cunningham is met with a ragtag band of prototypical, ultimately forgettable ballplayer characters including “Chubbs” (Charles Lott Jr.) the fun-first forward, Brandon (Brandon Wilson) the shy but talented point guard, and Marcus (Melvin Greg) the loud-mouthed, undisciplined center. Despite these formulaic developments, the chemistry of the young cast bleeds through the screen. The sideline interplay between Cunningham and Assistant Coach Dan (Al Madrigal) is in a word, magical, as Dan weaves timely one-liners between Cunningham’s blusterous remarks. Though the playful banter exchanged between Cunningham and his players is at times remarkably juvenile, it, too, has its moments of genuine hilarity. Despite that Cunningham brings genuinely charismatic moments to the underdog team, their resultant transformation is decidedly clichéd, complete with a "Rocky"-esque training montage that empowers the team as they roll from victory to sweeping victory.
O’Connor redeems this early cookie-cutter plot with creative narrative choices toward the film's end. Just when "The Way Back" feels destined to close with a classic sports film “big game” ending, O’Connor keeps viewers guessing. He unexpectedly but effectively shifts the narrative focus back on Cunningham's internal struggles with alcoholism, depression, and troubled memories of losing his nine-year-old son to cancer.
While Affleck is remarkable as the belligerent coach, swearing and sauntering about the court, what's most commendable is the way he melts into moments of seething vulnerability. Cunningham's voice cracks and shakes as he bows before his son’s grave, and Affleck efficiently conveys intimate feelings of defeat and remorse through body language. Affleck's committed, evocative performance stands in stark contrast to his latest roles as Batman in the DC universe and Christian Wolf in "The Accountant" because it demonstrates a much larger emotional range and feels particularly earnest given Affleck’s own struggles with alcoholism and substance abuse.
The conclusion for “The Way Back” leaves multiple plot threads unresolved, at times placing the viewer at a total loss. O'Connor never explicitly reveals Cunningham's emotional state at the resolution, instead leaving the viewer to pick out cues left by the melancholic score and idyllic cinematography. The final shot captures a delicate vision of hope, as Cunningham’s fate hangs in limbo. The camera zooms away from Cunningham putting up shots alone on a sunlit court by the sea. Palm trees and glossy waves surround the asphalt square that shrinks away, an ever smaller Jack chasing his rebounds as the camera cuts to black. The final result is an introspective, cathartic, and almost poignant depiction of healing and all the uncertainties that come with it.
Overall, “The Way Back” showcases some of Affleck's best acting in years, but presents it in a regrettably incomplete sports saga. As the credits roll, the viewer is left alone to question whether the Bishop Hayes players realized their championship dreams, if Cunningham will finally conquer his inner demons, and possibly their own choices at the ticket stand. The resultant point O’Connor drives home is that people often take fulfillment for granted. Sometimes, the road to recovery never ends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No one can deny Bob Iger’s place in Hollywood history. Under his leadership as CEO of The Walt Disney Company, the Mouse House set unprecedented box office records, becoming the first studio to gross over $10 billion in a calendar year. Disney has become an unparalleled global conglomerate in large part thanks to Iger’s tenacity in acquiring renowned brands and studios: Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Studios in 2009 for just $4.2 billion, Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.1 billion, and, most recently, 20th Century Fox in 2019 for $71.3 billion.
But as we reflect on Iger’s legacy, it's uncertain whether Disney will be able to maintain this dominance going forward. Iger left the studio in something of a strange position, tapping out as CEO right as all his major franchises concluded, and with the glaring issues of the Fox acquisition left without a clear solution. The Fox purchase has been plagued with disappointment after disappointment, with disastrous box office openings for “Dark Phoenix,” “Terminator: Dark Fate,” “Ad Astra,” and “Spies in Disguise.” Fox’s two major 2020 releases thus far — “Underwater,” starring Kristen Stewart, and the Harrison Ford-vehicle “The Call of the Wild” — are each expected to lose tens of millions of dollars for the studio.
To be fair, the deal was multilayered and its full effect has yet to be seen. Efforts such as acquiring specific Fox franchises (“Deadpool,” “Avatar,” “X-Men”), gaining a foothold at the Oscars through the Fox Searchlight division, and bolstering their new streaming service, Disney+, with oodles of content were all part of the plan. But it’s doubtful that these endeavors alone can pull Disney out of its $70 billion foxhole.
The last “X-Men” movie was a failure. “Avatar” has all but vanquished from popular culture. And while, on its face, Disney+ certainly appears to be a rousing success — it’s garnered nearly 30 million subscribers just months into launch — sustained interest is far from given. The service has only grown more selective with regard to the kinds of programs allowed; more “mature” fare like “Love, Victor” and “Lizzie McGuire” have either been moved to a different streamer or put on indefinite hold. It has become abundantly clear that Disney+ is for children first, making it difficult to imagine the service remaining a top priority for childless consumers.
The longevity of other acquired franchises is similarly up in the air: Both Luscasfilm’s Star Wars and The Marvel Cinematic Universe saw their franchises unofficially conclude in 2019. “The Rise of Skywalker” was marketed as the final film in the Skywalker saga. The franchise has suffered diminishing returns since its 2015 resurgence — “The Rise of Skywalker'' grossed just half of the $2 billion raked in by “The Force Awakens” — while the box office flop of the spinoff film “Solo: A Star Wars Story'' proved that mainstream interest may be focused primarily on the Skywalker saga.
And while Marvel is still rightfully considered the biggest film franchise at the moment (and in history), the conclusion of the Infinity Saga with “Avengers: Endgame” raises questions about its potential now that marquee stars — including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans — have wrapped up their storylines. Will audiences still care about the MCU knowing the battle they’ve been building towards has already taken place? It might be foolish to bet against Marvel considering their stunning track record, but it’s similarly difficult to imagine another movie flirting with the $2.8 billion gross of “Avengers: Endgame," currently the highest grossing movie of all time.
Pixar spent the better part of the 2010s reliving their glory days with sequels to their most popular films. The decade was bookended with “Toy Story” sequels, and also saw the release of “Monsters University,” “Finding Dory,” and “Incredibles 2.” While Pixar produced several of its biggest films under Iger’s leadership, they mostly coasted on prior success and generational nostalgia. They’ve essentially run out of films to franchise — I doubt you’ll be seeing “A Bug’s Afterlife” or “Rata-2-ille” at a theater near you. Their future will fully depend on their ability to generate new animated classics, a difficult task for any studio.
Disney’s live action division saw similar trends to Pixar. It found huge success in its remakes of “Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin,” and “The Lion King,” but, as Disney has found, not all remakes are created equal. Audiences clamored for a visually innovative “Jungle Book” adaptation, driving it to almost $1 billion worldwide, but comparative indifference for Tim Burton’s “Dumbo” remake caused it to bomb at the box office. Disney has burned through much of its most valuable animated catalog. While one could still see a global smash in the eventual “Little Mermaid” adaptation or some variation of “Frozen” down the line, a live action offering for “Pocahontas,” “Bambi,” or the like could prove to be a difficult sell. Disney is even having a tough time making sequels of their hit remakes, with “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” grossing $300 million less than its predecessor, while “Alice Through the Looking Glass” failed to gross even a third of what “Alice in Wonderland” grossed just six years prior. What’s worse, Iger failed to launch a single original live action franchise in his entire run at Disney: its last such hit was “National Treasure” back in 2004. It crafts a stunningly poor picture for Disney’s strength outside its top brands, and the fact that so many of those brands have concluded leaves Disney’s future prospects relatively bleak.
To be clear, Bob Iger should be commended for making the Disney company a global behemoth on a scale unparalleled in Hollywood history. He is stepping down as CEO after a barn-burner 2019 that launched some of Hollywood’s largest films to date. But now the barn has burned. Many of the largest brands have concluded, with their most popular stories told and their most popular actors moving on. After securing a place in the history books for spearheading Disney’s greatest successes, he left the studio in a position where they are unlikely to ever again reach those heights — great for Iger personally, but not so much for the company he ran. 2020 is a major test case for The Mouse House, as potential franchise starters ("Jungle Cruise" and "Artemis Fowl") and smaller scale franchise fare ("Black Widow" and "Eternals") fill their slate.

“At times like this the world looks to Harvard for leadership, intellectual and otherwise,” wrote University President Lawrence S. Bacow last week in his “Dear Colleagues” letter about the University’s response to the coronavirus crisis. While he mentioned that Harvard’s dorms have been all but emptied, he said nothing about deploying those dorms as a life-saving resource for new coronavirus patients.
Sadly, President Bacow just wrote once again to the Harvard community, this time to report that he and his wife Adele have tested positive for COVID-19. This upsetting news brings into yet higher relief the immediacy of the threat posed by this highly contagious virus.
Tufts has already announced its readiness to house patients afflicted by the new coronavirus.  Middlebury College has done the same. So far, Harvard has remained silent.
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants – substantially fewer than the 3.2 beds per 1,000 in Italy’s overwhelmed hospital system. We all know the deadly results of that country’s lack of coronavirus preparedness. South Korea has more than four times as many beds per capita as the U.S. — one of a number of factors contributing to that country’s superior preparedness.
We will need 200,000 intensive care unit beds to cope with a moderate coronavirus outbreak, according to Professor Aaron E. Carroll at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Hundreds of thousands and possibly millions more will be needed in the likely event that the virus becomes more pervasive. Today we have 45,000 ICU beds, most of them already occupied by currently sick patients. We need to fill an enormous gap in weeks, not months or years. Repurposing our now-vacant dormitories as hospital wards is one key way to begin. Some dorms, due to their configuration, might best be deployed in caring for non-ICU patients, freeing up in-hospital capacity for patients who are more gravely ill. Healthcare workers who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients might also need temporary housing to spare their families unnecessary exposure to the disease. Other dorms might be relatively well-suited to patients needing intensive care. Determining these resource allocations should be assigned to smart, experienced healthcare professionals.
However Harvard’s dorm beds and related food services are used, they must be made available now. President Bacow must show courage and leadership in stepping up to this challenge.
Some might say, “Why not deploy hotels as COVID-19 care facilities?” This, in fact, is now being negotiated by officials in New York City, which is also making plans to turn the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a coronavirus hospital. Rooms in now-empty hotels, together with currently idled hotel kitchens, can offer invaluable healthcare services if promptly deployed. In the face of this urgent humanitarian need, we must deploy all available resources.
Making hundreds of thousands of beds available to COVID-19 and other patients is essential — but of course, it will not address other grave deficiencies in our ability to combat this pandemic. In the U.K., Vauxhall and Airbus are gearing up to manufacture ventilator components using 3D printers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has challenged these and other manufacturers to help produce 20,000 ventilators in the next two weeks. To date, no parallel action has been taken here in the U.S.
Along with the shortfall in ventilators, we’re all aware of the shocking scarcity of protective gear for healthcare workers who are already placing themselves at enormous risk in treating coronavirus patients. On March 20, after weeks of delay, President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, giving the federal government authority to compel U.S. manufacturers to produce equipment essential to fighting this dread disease. No sooner had he done so, however, than he began backpedaling on mandating the immediate retooling by textile companies, medical equipment manufacturers, and others that could begin to fill the desperate shortfall in life-saving ventilators and vital safety equipment such as masks, gowns, and gloves. His weak excuse in this moment of dire need: “The concept of nationalizing our businesses is not a good concept.”
Requisitioning the hospital beds needed to care for COVID-19 patients is another step the federal government should be taking. But Harvard should not wait before taking its own decisive action. It should immediately collaborate with partners in government and the healthcare sector to make sure its facilities are fully tapped.
President Bacow ended his letter to Harvard colleagues with the Talmudic saying that saving one life is equivalent to saving the entire world. Harvard has a historic opportunity to save hundreds if not thousands of lives. It must not walk away from this challenge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This isn’t going to be one of my regular column articles. It’s more casual. Probably less refined too. Fewer hours have been spent crafting it — we’ve all been a little preoccupied. It’s definitely a break from the norm of my column. But I think that break is not only warranted but valuable at this moment. These last couple of weeks have been a break from normality in general, and I believe my column should reflect that — not hide from it.
Still, it is important that this is only that — a break — and not a permanent trend.
It seems wrong to write about something unrelated to this global pandemic the world is in. If the world feels like it’s ending to so many, surely we have surpassed the point of caring about ‘petty’ personal issues? How can I bring myself to write a column about my identity and society if literally no one’s identity or any society could matter in a few months?
I can’t...
Or at least that’s what I thought a couple of days ago while looking at my list of ideas for this column that did not include the ‘in case of global pandemic’ option. And I suppose to some extent it is still true as — here I am — not writing about what I usually would.
I found myself frustrated — angered, even — by the fact that nothing that usually matters to me could hold any water in my mind. Knowing that I am not alone in this feeling, I figured I would try to channel my anger into something useful. I just had no idea what that was.
“Resentment is like drinking poison and hoping it will kill your enemies” — a Nelson Mandela quote that ran through my mind while I was busy being mad at a virus that, quite literally, couldn’t care less about me. And this sparked the realization that it was I, who was choosing to be angered. It was I, who was choosing to not let the things that usually matter to me, matter. I chose to push aside the issues that I am usually most passionate about. The virus did not do that for me, or you, or anyone. That is a choice we are actively making.
One of the most troubling effects of this virus to me is the apocalyptic sentiment it has aroused in us. A big part of that is what I described. As the virus affects more and more people, it feels like nothing matters anymore. But it is only the end of the world if we let it be. If society falls apart — which is to say we find ourselves living some dystopian future — that will only be because we let it happen.
The troubling thing is that, in large part, it is in our control.
Thus, we should all choose to not drink our own ‘poison’. Let’s choose not to be angered by how this virus is changing our lives. Let’s choose to continue to care about all the things we always do. Society can not possibly fall apart if we all continue to care. That is the ‘something useful’ we can all channel our energy to. That is how we will ensure that this is a break from normality and not a new normal in these times.
If you care about climate change, set your mind to that. If you care about politics, do that. If you care about social justice, make social change. I write this column because I care about the experiences of the African diaspora, and I am going to continue to do that. Heck, if you care about cooking, or music, or dance, or video games, do that! Anything you care about — supposedly ‘important’ or not — continue to care about it.
There are, of course, things that it is just not possible to do — watching live sports comes to mind immediately. (And there are good reasons for that; please follow all of the instructions of governments and experts). But just because we cannot DO certain things doesn’t mean we are unable to CARE about them too. We can care about sports without watching it live. We can care about the climate without being outside. We can advocate for our interests while not being around people. We must simply be creative.
So I will spare you the obligatory calls to stay safe and healthy. I will, instead, urge us to love the things we always do. We must believe in our ability to overcome this pandemic while still loving what we love — finding ways to continue to participate in them however we can. As this is where we will find relief from the frustration of the times in which we are living. Again, it is only the end of the world if we let it be.
I will be back in two weeks with a regular column. Hopefully, it can feel ‘regular’ by then.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the many existential, personal, and pedagogical questions that have occupied Harvard affiliates during our viral separation, one question has begun to take on a particularly frenetic public discourse: How should Harvard grade its undergraduates? Of all the options on the table — “Double A” model endorsed by the Undergraduate Council President and Vice President, various opt-in setups, differentiated timelines — a universal pass-fail system is by far the most equitable grading option.
This would not be unique. MIT, Wellesley College, Columbia University, and Dartmouth College, among others, have all implemented such a system, as they seek to support students in the multivalent complexities of their now far-flung lives.
At a time when our lives and those of our friends and families are at stake — when a sense of normalcy is all but lost — it is callous to expect students to maintain their usual academic attention. Differences in the grades students might earn this semester would primarily reflect arbitrary variables — one’s time zone, access to technology, mental and physical health, and living situation. Under such a system, the typical letter grade model would not faithfully differentiate between students’ effort and ability. Disproportionately hurting already imperiled students, it would exaggerate inequality in our community and threaten students’ capacity to focus on their wellbeing.
Understandably, there may be students who were counting on letter grades this semester — not least for scholarship eligibility. For them, a pass-fail grade may feel devastating. In light of more pressing concerns about equity, however, any change must be universal. An optional system would incentivize students to competitively signal to professors and employers that they went above and beyond. Choosing pass-fail would likely be quietly but powerfully stigmatized, but it would also be the choice most necessary for those most impacted.
Furthermore, an optional system would only magnify the inconsistencies among departments and instructors. Without universal action, each concentration will, as they already are, independently decide whether to accept “passes” for concentration credit, creating a confusing and unequal patchwork of policies.
To be sure, the “Double A” proposal, which would limit grades to either an A or A-minus, according to a UC poll, has majority support. We find this model improbable and impractical. It adds fodder to existing concerns that Harvard inflates grades, which only undermines the credibility of our transcripts. Students at the Law School have shown that advocacy plays a central role in guaranteeing equitable grading. The UC leadership cannot risk its negotiating credibility with such an unlikely proposal, especially when more probable and beneficial proposals are on the table.
But Harvard has to go above and beyond. To further mitigate students’ stress, it should, first, consider acknowledging — ideally on transcripts themselves — the extenuating circumstances for students who do not pass. It should, second, actively communicate with other institutions to ensure students are not adversely impacted in their future pursuits.
Moreover, if the standard model ultimately prevails, students should not be limited to the new April 13 pass-fail deadline — even extending the deadline to after final examinations as McGill University has.
The University cannot slip into the often tempting rhetoric of pass-fail as an impetus for student laziness, nor can it pretend that academic life is somehow normal — that Zoom doesn’t glitch or that Hong Kong is on EST. Acknowledging the extreme difficulty of this moment requires a bold change in grading policy. That policy is universal pass-fail.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow has tested positive for COVID-19, he announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday.
Bacow wrote that he and his wife, Adele F. Bacow, learned they tested positive for the virus Tuesday afternoon after first experiencing symptoms on Sunday. He wrote they experienced coughing, followed by fevers, chills, and muscle aches.
He added that the pair contacted their doctors on Monday and received tests the same day.
“We were tested yesterday and just received the results a few minutes ago,” Bacow wrote. “We wanted to share this news with all of you as soon as possible.”
Bacow wrote that they do not know how they contracted the virus, but have been working from home and limiting contact with others since March 14.
“Neither of us knows how we contracted the virus, but the good news—if there is any to be had—is that far fewer people crossed our paths recently than is usually the case,” he wrote. “We began working from home and completely limiting our contact with others on March 14 in keeping with recommendations to adopt social distancing measures.
As of Tuesday afternoon, 18 Harvard affiliates have tested positive for COVID-19, according to Harvard University Health Services. Last Tuesday, Bacow announced classes would move online after spring break and encouraged students to not return to campus. College students were required to vacate their dorms by Sunday, and staff in some parts of the University — including the Central Administration — began a pilot work-from-home system the following day.
Bacow’s Tuesday email stated that Department of Public Health authorities will reach out to his close contacts in accordance with health protocols.
COVID-19 has an estimated incubation period of 1 to 14 days, after which an infected person will start displaying symptoms, according to the World Health Organization.
Bacow wrote in his email that the virus can “lay anyone low,” adding that University affiliates should be “vigilant” and follow guidelines to limit contact with others.
“Your swift actions over the past few weeks—to respond to the needs of our community, to fulfill our teaching mission, and to pursue research that will save lives—have moved me deeply and made me extraordinarily grateful and proud,” he wrote.
He concluded by writing he hopes students are taking precautions as advised by public health experts.
“The world needs your courage, creativity, and intelligence to beat this virus—wishing each of you good health,” Bacow wrote.

A new study co-authored by Harvard School of Public Health biostatistics professor Xihong Lin elucidates how coronavirus spread in Wuhan, China and analyzes the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions — such as isolation and social distancing — in containing the outbreak.
A preliminary version of the study was published on March 6 on MedRxiv, a non-peer-reviewed platform. In the article, the research team — which combined the efforts of scientists at Harvard and universities in Wuhan and Shanghai, China — wrote that an analysis of more than 25,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the city showed aggressive disease containment efforts have “considerably changed the course” of the outbreak, despite the lack of an effective treatment or vaccine.
Many of Lin’s colleagues across Harvard’s Longwood campus, its affiliated hospitals, and its research institutes are also working on containment and treatment strategies to combat the novel coronavirus.
Lin gave an overview of the research in a virtual seminar for Harvard affiliates on March 13, recommending a large-scale approach for controlling the virus.
The researchers identified multiple epidemiological features of the virus, including common means of transmission. They observed that it was common for the virus to spread from one infected family member to the next.
They also described roughly 60 percent of cases as “un-ascertained” — that is, undetected because they are mild or asymptomatic — which could leave infected individuals free to unwittingly infect others if precautionary measures are not taken.
In her slides, Lin noted that increased testing capacity is critical to address the large number of undiagnosed cases. In the face of the current low testing capacity in the United States, Lin recommended an “intermediate multi-pronged strategy,” including centralized quarantine for confirmed and suspected cases, symptomatic cases, and even asymptomatic close contacts. Her recommended approach also involved large-scale screening using symptoms — regardless of testing kit availability — to recommend courses of action for potential cases.
The study also confirmed that the risk of a severe COVID-19 case increases with age, and observed that women had a significantly lower risk of developing severe complications than men.
Lin noted in her presentation that the Chinese government reported on March 12 that none of the 42,000 healthcare personnel sent to Wuhan were infected with the virus. Lin credited this to full-body protective gear and stringent hospital protocols, which are not universally used throughout the United States. She further recommended that American hospitals adopt similar measures.
Lin remained hopeful about stopping the outbreak throughout her presentation.
“Wuhan experience helps us not start from zero,” Lin wrote on her concluding slide. “Good policy, strategy and leadership, cooperation are the key!”

Along with 11 other alumni groups, the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard — an alumni group centered on increasing diversity at the University — endorsed five candidates for this year’s Board of Overseers election and six candidates for an elected director position on the board of the Harvard Alumni Association.
The Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — is responsible for providing input on decisions regarding the direction of the University, counseling Harvard’s top administrators, and approving certain actions by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Board members serve six-year terms.
The Coalition's chosen Board of Overseers candidates include Tracy K. Smith ’94, Diego A. Rodriguez, Raphael W. Bostic ’87, Dororthy “Thea” L. Sebastian ’08, and David H. Eun ’89. Rodriguez and Eun are members of the Coalition.
The Coalition was joined by 11 other alumni groups in endorsing this slate of candidates, including First Generation Harvard Alumni, the Harvard Arab Alumni Association, the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, the Harvard Black Alumni Society, the Harvard Gender & Sexuality Caucus, the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance, Harvard Progressive Jewish Alumni, the Harvard South Asian Alumni Alliance, Harvard Tamil Sangam Alumni, Harvard Women of Color, and Native American Alumni of Harvard University.
Michael G. Williams ’81, a board member of the Coalition, said he was grateful for the support of other alumni groups.
“I do want to give a shout out and express our gratitude with the fact that, for the first time, we had so many organizations involved with Harvard who are also co-endorsing with us,” Williams said. “We at Diverse Harvard think that it’s a very strong statement that the organizations agree with our judgment that this set of endorsed candidates are really the best choices for Harvard's future.”
The Coalition formed in 2016 in response to an alumni group’s ticket for the Board of Overseers. Former presidential candidate and environmental activist Ralph Nader lead the alumni group, named “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” which ran on a controversial platform of eliminating tuition and questioning affirmative action in Harvard’s admissions process.
The Coalition’s candidate review committee reached its endorsement decision through evaluating a diversity questionnaire, researching candidates’ backgrounds, and interviewing the 13 candidates for the Board of Overseers, according to Williams.
Williams said ethnic studies at Harvard is a key issue for the organization, and candidates’ positions on the subject were “definitely an important consideration” as the alumni advocacy group reviewed their candidates.
In this year’s race for the Board of Overseers, Harvard Forward — an alumni organization advocating for the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry — campaigned to put several candidates’ names on the ballot. Sebastian, one of the Coalition’s endorsed Overseers candidates, is a part of the slate of candidates Harvard Forward put forth last fall.
The Coalition also endorsed six of the nine candidates for the HAA directorship, including Kelsey T. Leonard ’10, Joyce Y. Zhang ’09, Mallika J. Marshall ’92, Vanessa M. Zoltan, Santiago Creuheras, and Michael D. Lewis ’93. Zhang, Marshall, Zoltan, Creuheras, and Lewis are members of the Coalition.
This year’s elections are scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 19. Harvard alumni are eligible to vote online or by traditional paper ballot or online, except those in University instruction and governance positions as well as members of the Harvard Corporation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the transition to online instruction already underway, leaders of the College’s nearly 600 extracurricular offerings are also making the switch to virtual platforms to connect with their members and continue operations.
The move online comes in the wake of University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s March 10 announcement that students must vacate their on-campus housing due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As a result, most organizations’ usual meeting spaces — like Farkas Hall and various classrooms in Sever Hall — stand empty.
At first merely a home for Harvard classes, Zoom — a video conference platform — has now become the hub of extracurricular life as well.
Nikole L. Naloy ’21, the founder and editor-in-chief of Fig. Magazine, wrote in an email that she and her production team — composed of 38 members — are working diligently to complete their next issue, scheduled for the end of May. Fig. Magazine uses its platform to explore fashion as a medium that is “deeply relevant to the understanding of our past, present, and future world,” according to Naloy.
Naloy wrote that she believes the unexpected shift to Zoom has challenged her and her team to think more creatively in developing their content.
“The quarantine has mandated a unique creative rubric we must now work with,” she wrote. “It’ll let us see the capacities of fashion to change the space and roles we are currently restricted to.”
“I’m excited by what our team will come up with during these next two weeks — we have some fun plans in the works (we’ll be bringing kiddy pools and floaties to our living rooms),” she added.
Naloy wrote that she expects the production of virtual editorials to be “as chaotic as ever,” adding that she remains “optimistic” the magazine will be able to produce its next issue as planned.
Harvard Ballet Company co-directors Ana Maria Delmar ’21 and Abbey S. Y. Pan ’22 wrote in an email that though the group’s April performance has been canceled, members still have the option to virtually participate in the company’s activities. HBC — which boasts more than 40 members — will hold weekly Tuesday classes taught by one of its members on Zoom.
Delmar and Pan also wrote that the group is already planning for future projects.
“We are awaiting more information from the performing arts/theater community at Harvard to see how shows that were supposed to perform but did not make it to the stage are to proceed next semester,” they wrote. “Once we get more information about this from theater staff, we are going to strategize about how to hopefully proceed with next semester’s performances and pick up the pieces of all the work we began this semester to create something new.”
For some student organizations, however, leaving campus has left them unable to operate.
Eric A. Tarlin ’21, music director for the a cappella group the Harvard Opportunes, said that because the Opportunes are a “collaborative” performance group, they will not be able to continue their regular activities. He added, however, that the group will hold weekly check-ins on Zoom to keep members socially connected and that they are still looking to record their annual album.
“We couldn’t continue with our activities as usual; you can’t sing together with the latency of online video chats,” he said. “So, it really ended our year early rather than changed the nature of it. At the end of the day, it cuts a year short.”
Reuben A. Stern ’20, who has served as music director for the Bach Society Orchestra — commonly known as BachSoc — for the past three years, called the loss of the semester “devastating.” They said the group has had to “essentially cease” all activities, including biweekly rehearsals and an upcoming concert.
“We are unable to continue music making together in the same way, but we may, over the coming weeks and months, figure out some sort of long distance social activities that we can take part in,” Stern said. “It takes a while to build the sort of familiarity and ease of communication that one needs to do work very well with an orchestra, and not having that sort of last hurrah, so to speak, hit me pretty hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As restaurants, grocery stores, and other essential establishments continue to operate around Harvard Square, salons and other non-essential businesses have shuttered — provoking deep uncertainty for store owners who face the possibility of months without revenue.
Richard J. Fogarty, owner of Plan B Salon in the Square, said he and his salon face the “great unknown” as they wait to reopen.
“Hopefully it won't be too prolonged. I don't know any small business that could survive a sustained closure,” Fogarty said. “We can handle a good eight weeks without any revenue coming in, but beyond that, we might have to count on some lines of credit.”
Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 announced on March 16 that the state would offer $10 million in emergency loans to small businesses affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Federal lawmakers are currently negotiating a nearly $2 trillion stimulus package that could also provide aid to small businesses.
Teo D. Sorce, owner of Le Petit Salon, said that, like Plan B, her business will face a struggle to remain financially afloat.
“Three weeks ago we had about over 50 percent cancellation. Now we have 100 percent cancellation,” she said.
Sorce said the pandemic has put her salon in a “bad, bad situation” financially.
“My business moved to Harvard Square a little bit over a year ago, and we just did the renovation,” she said. “We’re in a difficult position.”
On Monday, Baker issued an emergency order requiring all non-essential businesses and organizations to close their facilities to workers and the public effective March 24 and lasting until at least April 7. But even before that order, Cambridge had issued its own temporary emergency order on Friday closing all hair and nail salons, spas, and fitness clubs.
“Cambridge was ahead of the game here by a couple of days in terms of the closure of these businesses,” Jeremy Warnick, communications director for the Cambridge Police Department, said in an interview.
Warnick specifically cited the city’s program to contract with local restaurants to deliver food to homeless Cambridge residents.
“We recognize how much of a hit that is for a lot of businesses,” he said. “That's why Cambridge has been really creative in terms of some of its responses around to do everything they can to support businesses.”
Even before the state and city orders forced their closures, Harvard Square businesses have grappled with how to respond to the health and safety concerns brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. Some had opted to remain open, albeit with limited crowds, while others had shut their doors out of an abundance of caution.
“Once Harvard decided to close, you knew the writing was on the wall of what may or may not come,” Fogarty said. “There wasn't going to be any business to be had, whether or not we were told to shut down.”
“Now it's just a matter of waiting this out,” he added.
But Fogarty is already looking towards the day when he once again can see a steady stream of clients coming through the door, saying he is preparing a social media “blitz” when life returns to normal.
“We're gonna do all we can at this point to ensure a jumpstart in business once we reopen,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard mandated that students vacate campus two weeks ago to prevent the spread of coronavirus, undergraduates were forced to bid hasty, uncertain, and often tearful goodbyes to their friends, fellow club members, and significant others.
In order to sustain the relationships forged on campus, many students recently scattered across the country — and the world — say they are leveraging their newfound overabundance of time to improvise ways to stay close.
Charlotte Ruhl ’22 said that she has availed herself of Houseparty, a social networking app that alerts you when your friends are online and allows groups to spontaneously form over video chat.
“You just open the app and other people get a notification that you're in the house, and then it can prompt them to open the app,” Ruhl said. “I like it because you don’t have to organize or pre-plan when you’re gonna do it.”
“It's also really nice because I have different friend groups, but they're all on Houseparty. So I can just keep in touch with everyone,” she added.
Jeffrey R. “Jeff” Prince ’22 also said he has convened with groups of friends through “Playstation parties.”
“I've always been a big advocate for video games as a form of art and a form of storytelling, but they also provide nice portals into worlds that are not dealing with pandemics,” he said. “It's a great way to join up with a couple friends from around the world.”
Student organizations have also been innovating means of helping members keep in touch. Cathy Sun ’22, chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, said she hosted a four-hour-long social where eight members used the “Netflix Party” Google Chrome browser extension to simultaneously watch the political drama “The West Wing” while sending instant messages via Zoom.
“We ended up just chatting over Zoom for around four hours and we messed around with the virtual background, putting all sorts of images of viruses on each other's faces,” Sun said.
Sun said the group has faced some issues with lagtimes on Zoom due to members’ varying internet speeds. She also noted that socializing through a screen lacks the intimacy of on campus interactions.
“But honestly, when we have these really fun conversations that last for hours, you can forget that,” she said. “And you’re just reminded about how lucky and grateful you are to have a community like HPOP to lean on.”
Sun said HPOP plans to host a Zoom face mask night where members can casually converse while exfoliating, virtual wine nights, and online games of Cards Against Humanity.
Alexander S. “Sandy” Koenig ’21 said the Harvard Political Union debate society is mailing snacks to members for consumption during their weekly meeting, which will now take place over Zoom.
“We're trying to be hygienic, so we sent out little snack-size Hershey's bars, snack-sized M&M’s, snack-sized Reese's, snack-sized Kit Kats. The ones that fit into little envelopes,” Koenig said.
“Along with my executive team, we were discussing different ways that we could foster that sense of community and stay a little bit fun and keep that sort of mischievous vibe,” he said. “This is a tough time, but nothing will stop the HPU.”
Campus cultural organizations have also been discussing how to connect their community members through online events.
The South Asian Association began a “virtual dates” program where members are matched and assigned to get a meal over FaceTime once or twice a week.
“This gives people the chance to really socialize with people that they know but also get chances to meet new people within the organization, which is like an important component of our community back on campus,” SAA member Nikhil Dharmaraj ’23 said.
Dharamaj also launched an initiative called “Corona Care Cards” where members mail handwritten notes and care packages to a partner.
Sun said she thinks strengthening social ties is more important now than ever as students confront coronavirus anxiety away from their campus support systems.
“We definitely want to keep the social community alive even while we're not together and scattered all around the world, especially because this is a very tumultuous time for a lot of people and everyone could use some emotional support,” she added.

The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter announced it was closing for the rest of the season on Sunday morning, stopping daily lotteries for beds and halting in-person services amid challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
Staffed by members of Harvard’s Phillip Brooks House Association, the shelter houses 24 people each night and is typically run entirely by students and volunteers. Its season typically runs from Nov. 1 to April 15. It is located in the basement of the University Lutheran Church and offers meals, toiletries, laundry, and other services to its guests.
“We are working with the University Lutheran Church to establish times that guests may retrieve bags stored at HSHS until April 15th,” a statement posted to the HSHS website reads.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has posed a host of challenges for the shelter. In recent weeks, HSHS took a number of safety precautions such as implementing a COVID-19 “screening protocol” for guests and staff and hiring a professional cleaning service to disinfect all surfaces in the shelter, according to an emailed statement provided by HSHS administrative directors Ethan M. Kahn ’20 and Matthew M. Jelen ’21.
The shelter also suspended its volunteer program, outsourcing its cooking and laundry and retaining only a “small group of student staff members” to run nightly shifts after most Harvard undergraduates were required to move off campus less than two weeks ago, according to Kahn and Jelen.
“HSHS relies on a unique collaboration between Harvard students, staff at PBHA, our guests, the congregation at the University Lutheran Church, and many other public and community stakeholders,” Kahn and Jelen wrote. “The circumstances of this year made it necessary for the shelter to close before the scheduled end of our season.”
The notice that the shelter would close came after HSHS launched an emergency fund to support costs related to COVID-19. PBHA executive director Maria J. Dominguez Gray indicated several days ago that her organization was working hard to keep the shelter open. The cost of operations did not play “a major factor” in HSHS's decision to close early for the season, according to the shelter.
Kahn and Jelen wrote that they plan to work with the University and Cambridge to address housing and shelter needs in the city.
“It is a moment of critical need for those most vulnerable in our community, and we believe that Harvard is in a unique position to mobilize its resources in support of the broader needs of Cambridge,” they wrote. “We plan to work with the University and the City of Cambridge to find solutions for some of these pressing needs, including beds and shelter for those experiencing homelessness.”
Y2Y Harvard Square, a shelter for young adults also staffed by PBHA in the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church, remained operational as of Tuesday night.
This past week, Harvard students circulated a petition calling for the University to offer its dorms to help house Cambridge’s homeless population. As of Tuesday night, the petition had accumulated over 1000 signatures from Harvard affiliates, Cambridge residents, and others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League honored two members of Harvard women’s basketball this season, naming senior forward Jeannie Boehm Second Team All-Ivy and awarding freshman guard Lola Mullaney with an honorable mention.
Both starters, Boehm and Mullaney led the Crimson to defy expectations that presumed the team would succumb to inexperience after losing three of its top four scorers the previous season. Boehm recorded five double doubles this season, while Mullaney notched 81 three pointers.
Despite decisive victories over Cal, Penn, and Yale, Harvard stumbled in the latter half of conference play and finished in fifth place in the conference. That finish prevented the Crimson from securing a spot in the postseason Ivy League Tournament, which did not take place as a result of the coronavirus.
Though a fifth place finish is rare for Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, she said she is proud of Boehm and Mullaney for their dedication and selfless play.
“I'm thrilled that Lola and Jeannie were both awarded All-Ivy honors,” she said.
Boehm said the award took on additional meaning to her during a time of confusion.
“We didn't make the Ivy League tournament, which was incredibly disappointing. And then March Madness was canceled altogether,” she said. “It felt really good in the midst of all the craziness. I was super honored to be on that list.”
Over the course of her career, Boehm worked her way to the top of several Crimson leaderboards. She was the second Harvard player in program history to block 244 shots and the fourth to grab 879 rebounds. The Winnetka, Il. native and McDonald All-American also notched 997 points in her 116 career games, all but one in which she started.
This season, Boehm’s experience steadied the otherwise young team. She averaged 9.7 points and 9.1 rebounds per game, nearly a double-double. Boehm grabbed 16 rebounds and scored 10 points in Harvard’s decisive home victory against rival Penn. In her last game sporting a Crimson jersey, she finished with 19 points and 15 rebounds.
Boehm said the highlight of her Harvard basketball career is the relationships she made with her teammates.
“College basketball — it's a really tough thing. It's a really long season, it's a lot of hours, you're there over winter break, you're there most times over spring break,” she said. “And so I think going through that grind and those tough times with other people, and then having this common goal and winning games and accomplishing goals together, I think that was definitely one of my favorite parts of college basketball.”
Though dozens of games and thousands of plays made up her career, Boehm reflected on one moment she shared with Delaney-Smith, who comforted her from the bench after she fouled out of the last home game of her career.
“What I was feeling in that moment is, ‘wow, we've been through a lot together.’ And I wouldn't have had it any other way and really do feel so lucky to have gotten to play under Kathy Delaney Smith,” she said. “We have and will have such a special relationship. I think I've grown so much as a result of her as a coach and as a mentor.”
Boehm, who concentrates in Economics, will work in marketing at L'Oréal in New York City upon graduation.
In her rookie season, Mullaney scored 377 points and became the second player in program history to record more than 80 three-pointers in a season. The Colts Neck, N.J. native evinced confidence from the first game of her college career, in which she shot 15 threes and scored 25 points.
Though she decisively contributed to the Crimson from her first game, Mullaney said the transition to college basketball was significant.
“I didn't really know what to expect, especially coming in as a freshman, getting a lot of playing time. It was so much different than playing in high school,” she said. “Definitely the speed and athleticism had to catch up to me.”
And yet, Mullaney led her older teammates by example this season. Against Yale, she scored 12 points in the third quarter to add fuel to the Crimson’s second-half surge. In Harvard’s win against Penn, she notched 20 points off of five for eight shooting from behind the arc.
Mullaney said she was thankful that the Ivy League recognized her with an honorable mention.
“It was an honor to get that award, especially being a freshman,” Mullaney said. “I was just really thankful to be recognized in that way.”
Mullaney said she is continuing to train in preparation for next season. She shared her personal goals and her expectations for next season.
“Individually I think just work on my game and whenever the time comes and we can go back to school and start playing again, just to improve upon myself each season,” she said. “This was a really young team and a rebuilding year so I think next year we even have some more parts that can contribute. And that we’ll be a really strong team coming in next year.”

D. What Zoom lecture? I don’t even have a webcam.
Results:
Mostly A’s: $1 Otto Pizza
You’re the reliable friend who is always there if anyone needs you. A constant presence likely to be found in Cabot Library at odd hours around the clock, others can count on you to not know what the lecture was about, but still have the most well-written notes to share. The $1 Otto pizza slice had your back when you were running from your p-setting session in Smith to a comp meeting in Sever, and will (hopefully) welcome you back with open arms in the fall!
Mostly B’s: 50% off Ben and Jerry’s
You’re spontaneous and adventurous in all the best ways. You were probably first in line buying out the LamCaf cheesecakes when the fateful email dropped in our inboxes.

When we’re back on campus, use this deal to splurge on the $50 Vermonster so it becomes a $25 treat split between you and your bestie.
Mostly C’s: 10% off Zinneken’s
Let’s be honest, you may come off as a bit stingy and haughty, but at least you’re fiercely independent and a Time Management boss. Cold emailing professors is second nature to you, and Bluestone Lane opening in November was the best thing to happen all of first semester. Once this quarantining business is all over, an Instagram story featuring Zinneken’s will be how you announce your return to campus in the fall.
Mostly D’s: Subway in the Garage Happy Hour
You’ve always kept to yourself, and the latest disastrous events of 2020 couldn’t change that even if they tried. You’re always chilling in the same seat of Science Center Hall B and somehow manage to make an appearance at every free food event on campus. Naptime is the highlight of your Gcal, no matter whether you’re on campus or on Zoom. Come next semester, taking advantage of Subway’s Happy Hour deal and visiting all the other restaurants in The Garage will be like sinking into a warm bath for you.

Harvard South Asian Association celebrated its annual production of Ghungroo during the last week of February. Ghungroo — the largest cultural show on campus — celebrates South Asian Culture at the Agassiz Theatre in Radcliffe Yard. There were over 300 students involved with performing, directing, and producing the dances, music, and skits of the show. This year’s performance utilized the setting and dynamics of the American city to celebrate the range of “linguistic, ideological, cultural, and religious diversity in South Asian America in the 21st century.”
During one of the first opening dances, Setu Mehta ’21 danced gracefully across the stage. Along with Rini Halder ’19, the pair performed the Kathak dance, one of the major classical dances of northern India and traditionally regarded as a dance of storytelling.
Dressed up in vibrant red and black traditional costumes, students in the Bhangra dance come together in an energetic display of explosive moves and color. The Bhangra dance is a Punjabi dance “tailored to make you start moving your shoulders in periodic shrugs.”
Intertwined between the dance and musical performances, the show had a series of skits that narrated the story of a family who immigrated to America and faced challenges adapting to their new environment. In this particular skit, Divya Vatsa ‘21 starred as Michael Scott in a parody of NBC’s "The Office," mixing humor with commentary about the American workplace.
Wearing white kurtas and gold blouses, dancers from the Filmi dance completed their energetic performance with a group pose, pointing to the audience and smiling. Filmi is said to pay homage to the heroes and heroines of Bollywood Cinema, displaying the colorful connection between the dance and music.
Dancers posed in a line at the start of the Semiclassical dance, described as a fast-paced, classically inspired dance mixing classical styles of South Asian dance with non-classical steps and movements.
In addition to the many dances and skits, Ghungroo showcased four musical performances, highlighting the diversity of South Asian music. Arranged by Jahnavi S. Rao ’22, this act titled Choral Ensemble, which was the final music act, used keyboard, violin, and tabla, as well as modern acapella-style vocals.
In the Throwback dance, the final dance of the underclassmen segment, Rushi A. Patel ’21, a Throwback choreographer, and Ryan Zhang ’21 danced passionately on stage. The Throwback dance is described to be “a favorite for grandparents, parents, and children alike!”.
For the last segment of every Ghungroo production, seniors come together to perform the classic Senior Dance, which lasts approximately thirty minutes. Over 100 students from the Class of 2020 partake in Senior Dance, which unites and bonds members of the class around excitement for South Asian dance.
The Senior Semiclassical dance continued the show with energy and excitement.
In one segment of the Senior Hype dance, Harshal Singh ’20 jumped over the other dancers and encouraged the audience to engage with the show.
In the final segment of Senior Dance, performers even danced in front of the stage, breaking the barrier between the show and the audience. Senior Dance ended with a high energy tune, explosive dance moves, and confetti falling across the Agassiz Theatre, as the seniors celebrated their final moments on stage and in Ghungroo.
Ghungroo Producers and SAA Presidents, Fatima Shahbaz ’21 and Karthik K. Rao ’21, proudly walked on stage through a crowd of Ghungroo Tech and Production team members and bowed during a curtain call at the end of the show.
Following the producers, Ghungroo Directors Debolina Ghosh ’21, Sreya R. Sudireddy ’21, and Ajay V. Singh ’21 ran to the front of the stage and bowed, while the Ghungroo Tech and Production team members applauded them.
While months of planning and preparation went into directing and producing the show, Ghungroo ended quickly after a weekend of four colorful and glamorous shows. Through skits, dance, and music performances, Ghungroo embodied the diversity of South Asia and shared elements of South Asian culture with the people from all across campus.
