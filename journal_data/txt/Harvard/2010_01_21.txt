After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Turns out you probably won't ever make up for those all-nighters you pulled in college. Researchers at Harvard-affiliate Brigham and Women's Hospital find that chronic sleep loss over several weeks causes reaction time to slow almost tenfold, increasing the risk of fatigue-related accidents.
Scientists have long figured out that sleep loss impairs memory formation and negatively impacts performance, but previous research had not investigated how short-term sleep deprivation interacts with chronic sleep loss, according to Daniel A. Cohen, a neurology instructor at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the paper.
The findings, published in last Wednesday in the interdisciplinary journal, Science Translational Medicine, show the effects of as little as one night's sleep loss on performance the following day.
To simulate staying up all night and sleeping extra hours the next day to catch up, the researchers put nine volunteers on a specialized sleep-wake schedule consisting of 33 hours of wakefulness and 10 hours of sleep. Using a series of tests, the researchers measured the subjects' reflexes, motor skills, memory, decision making, and other brain functions.
The results have yielded conclusions that may overturn commonly held misconceptions about sleep, Cohen said.
“One of the main take-home message is that… the amount or quality of the sleep for one night is not enough to determine whether someone is fully recovered from weeks of chronic sleep deprivation,” he said.
The findings have direct implications for college students, who frequently stay up all night to study, said Medical School professor Charles A. Czeisler '74, who is one of the authors.
Czeisler and his colleagues found that the body’s circadian rhythm—the natural 24-hour cycle—is actually able to partially override sleepiness during the day, which explains why some people mistakenly believe they have completely recovered lost sleep after only one or two nights of sleeping well.
But students don’t pull all nighters “out of the blue,” Czeisler said. Students are likely sleep only four to five hours a night the week leading up to exams. They may also stay up all night to finish studying right before the exam, which only burdens the already-present sleep debt even more.
“When you’re chronically sleep deprived and then you pull an all-nighter, your performance could be ten times worse than if you had been well-rested before the all-nighter,” Czeisler said. “And most likely you crash much worse at night.”
Several weeks into the study, for example, the subjects’ average reaction time at night had slowed from a quarter of a second to almost four seconds.
“That’s enough time to run off the road into a ditch,” Czeisler said, adding that the dangers of sleep deprivation touch people ranging from truck drivers to resident physicians.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge city officials filed a motion earlier this month to dismiss charges by Harvard neurologist S. Allen Counter alleging that he had been unfairly arrested three years ago.
In a complaint filed on Dec. 18, 2009, Counter alleged that Cambridge police officer William Macedo, acting under instructions from Detective Sgt. John Fulkerson, violated his 4th and 14th Amendment rights when arresting him in Dec. 2006.
Counter’s ex-wife told police that he had attempted to push his then-17-year-old daughter out of a moving car on Dec. 18, 2006, according to the complaint. Counter was arrested and charged that day with domestic assault and battery but was later acquitted when the girl told the court that he had not tried to push her from the car.
In his complaint, Counter alleged that the police officers performed an unlawful search and seizure by arresting him without probable cause. He said that they refused to state the charges against him at the time of his arrest and laughed when he asked why he was being arrested.
“One of [the police officers] was quoted as saying he ‘wanted to teach me a lesson’ by a witness,” Counter said.
The defendants—Macedo, Fulkerson, and Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy—asked the U.S. District Court to dismiss Counter’s complaint for failure to state a claim. In the motion, they argued they were not liable for the injuries Counter claimed, which include financial losses, humiliation, hypertension, high blood pressure, and depression.
Since the defendants are being sued in their official capacities as Cambridge city officials, Counter has effectively brought a lawsuit against the city, the motion argued. But a municipality bears no liability for “intentional torts” committed by its employees, and additionally, Counter does not show that the alleged civil rights violations resulted from a policy established by the city, the defense team wrote.
Fulkerson and Samuel A. Aylesworth, who represents the defendants, declined to comment for this story, and Macedo and Healy did not respond to requests for interviews.
Counter, who directs the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, alleged that the police officers’ improper actions constituted racial discrimination.
“We filed this suit because we believe that I, like many other persons of minority background, are victims of police abuse of power and discretion against minorities,” he said.
Counter compared his case to several others, including that of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. this past summer. He called the Gates case “a tragic reflection of the kind of racial profiling and hostility that African-Americans, especially men, face every day.”
“We don’t expect all of our white brothers and sisters to fully understand the nature of this racial humiliation,” Counter said. “We hope they do, but we don’t expect it.”
Counter said that he and his legal team—led by Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, who also represented Gates—have waited since 2006 to bring the discrimination suit for a variety of reasons, including a fear of “retaliation by the police.”
But the statute of limitations for the case was approaching, he said, and he and his attorneys decided to file the suit to make a public statement against discrimination.
“At some point, we as African-American men and women must stand up to racial abuse,” Counter said.

CORRECTION: January 22, 2010 
 
Due to an editing error, the title of the online version of the Jan. 21 news article "Harvard Professor Alleges Abuse By Cambridge Police" had originally been "Harvard Alleges Abuse By Cambridge Police." In fact, Harvard neurologist S. Allen Counter—and not the University—alleged that a Cambridge police officer violated two of his Amendment rights. The title has been changed to reflect the title of the article as it appeared in print.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in August, Graduate School of Education students Jill A. Carlson and Eleanor B. O’Donnell asked their classmate Debra L. Gittler to help them organize a project of international scope—but none of them had a clear idea of what exactly they wanted to do.
At the time, all three were studying international education policy at GSE, but they were disappointed that the school did not offer opportunities to gain the necessary experience abroad.
“We wanted to do an international project, but there were no real projects for us,” O’Donnell said. “So we set up our own.”
Pooling their resources, O’Donnell and Carlson realized that they both had experience working with books—either in collecting them or in expanding libraries. After a few phone calls to organizations she had previously worked with during her three-year stay as a literary coach and teacher trainer in El Salvador, Gittler secured the necessary logistical connections, and the three students soon began organizing what they would call the Learning Through Libraries project.
In an effort to promote literacy at international schools in poor municipalities, the trio—along with four other GSE students and a staff member—traveled to Caluco, El Salvador from Jan. 4 to Jan. 13 of January term. The group brought along 1,300 books to start three libraries, teaching parents and teachers in the area how to utilize these new resources both in the classroom and at home.
“Books just can open a world to students no matter where they are,” Carlson said. “Seeing the kids with a book and their parents with a book was probably most rewarding.”
MORE BOOKS THAN BOOKSHELVES
But the book-laden trip to Caluco did not come without extensive preparation on the part of volunteers who became involved in Learning Through Libraries. Nine hundred of the books brought to Caluco were new texts purchased with money procured through fundraising efforts.
In November, the 15 GSE volunteers involved in the project at the time organized a Thanksgiving dinner called “Give Thanks, Give Books.” Each guest donated $5 or brought a book in exchange for a plate of dinner. The result of the dinner bash was over $400 in donations, with which the project organizers bought books written in Spanish from Scholastic off of El Salvador’s Ministry of Education book list.
With the books now in possession, a more daunting problem confronted the project volunteers: moving over a thousand books 2,000 miles southward. In fact, the volunteers’ initial plan of hauling the books to El Salvador in fat suitcases seemed like an absurd idea, according to Carlson.
But after a few phone calls, the organizers were put through to the CEO of TACA Airlines—a Latin American airline company with a hub in Houston—who agreed to ship the books from Texas to El Salvador for free.
A PHOTO, A MURAL, A LIBRARY
Learning Through Libraries collaborated with FEPADE—a Salvadoran non-profit organization that encourages educational development across the country—to create a documentary photography workshop in one school, mural projects in two schools, and libraries in all three.
GSE student Briget C. Ganske, who worked with students from the Escuela de Comunicación Mónica Herrera to teach the documentary photography class, said she was able—through borrowing from GSE students, alumni, and friends—to provide digital cameras for the young students to learn to use. After two days, the students—most of whom had not even seen a digital camera before—were permitted to take the cameras home to photograph their typical afternoon, morning, and evening, according to Ganske. An exhibit of the students’ work will be presented both at Harvard and in El Salvador in February.
The mural project, which sought to bridge the cultural realms of storytelling and art, was led by GSE Arts in Education Program Coordinator Scott K. Ruescher, the staff member on the trip. Grandparents of students came to the schools to share stories about the history of their municipality as they saw it through their eyes—including a recollection of a train that ran through the city just before an earthquake hit and destroyed the tracks—and the children, with help from a local children’s book illustrator, translated the stories into paintings on a wall adjacent to the library being erected at the time.
The library project—which required extensive work from the Learning Through Libraries volunteers on most afternoons—consisted of not only covering and cataloging the books for check-out, but also teaching students how to use and appreciate the library system and showing teachers how to use the library in the classroom.
O’Donnell said that prior to the volunteers’ arrival, the library systems in the three Caluco schools were either non-existent or severely lacking, with only a few dozen books—most of them tattered—and a mere notebook to keep track of circulation.
HEARTS HIT HOME
Though Carlson, O’Donnell, and Gittler are graduating in the spring, the mission they have sought to uphold through Learning Through Libraries will not cease once they leave campus. The trio hope that Ruescher will promote the kind of service exemplified by the project in years to come—and perhaps even turn the undertaking into an actual J-Term course in the future. Currently, the Amigos School in Cambridge has collected over 700 books, waiting to bring literacy to a new group of students abroad through Learning Through Libraries.
The organizers of Learning Through Libraries are in awe at how a mere seed of an idea—the desire to “do something”—has blossomed into a full-fledged project with reverberations truly felt across national borderlines.
“I think it really enhanced the learning process for us,” O’Donnell said, as she reflected on the wide collaborative network established to bring the project into fruition. “It was so great to have different people from different programs to contribute their skills.”
“I never knew [some idea] could be turned to something so powerful and life changing,” Carlson said. “It can take on its own life. It’s just a beautiful organic project, and I didn’t really realize what an amazing thing we were a part of until it was actually happening.”
At the end of the first day, Carlson asked the 15 or so parents who had voluntarily showed up to the library workshop: “Is there anything anyone would like to say?”
A subdued mother stood up, Carlson recalled. As nervous as the woman was, she did not hesitate to show her gratitude, thanking God and project volunteers for their presence in Caluco. The mother said that she never imagined that there were people in other places—in the United States, in fact—who were thinking of others beyond their country lines. And of all places—to help the citizens of El Salvador! It was a blessing, she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Senator-elect Scott P. Brown visited the Harvard Republican Club last spring, Rachel L. Wagley ’11 did not know that less than a year later she would be volunteering for Brown’s campaign to attain a seat in the U.S. Senate.
“He was very personable, very funny,” Wagley recalled. “It was before we knew he had a future—I didn’t know that he had nation-wide, or even state-wide, aspirations.”
But Brown took center stage in his recent race for the Senate seat against Democrat and Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley. As the race grew heated, Wagley said that she felt the need to take action and make a difference in the election.
Members of the Harvard Republican Club and the Harvard Democrats have spent the last few weeks making phone calls and volunteering for campaigns in the lead-up to Tuesday’s election, in which Brown defeated Coakley to fill the Senate seat formerly held by liberal Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
Both Harvard Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 and Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11 said that January term, which scattered their members throughout the country for a few weeks, hurt the clubs’ ability to foster a stronger volunteer effort on behalf of their respective candidates.
“When we’re on campus, we usually pitch it as a social event,” Berkenfeld said. “I don’t think we had as much of an impact on this race as we would have if we didn’t have the calendar change.”
Despite their distance from Massachusetts, many club members across the country contributed to campaign efforts by calling voters through online phone-banking systems.
“This is the first moment since I came to college that I wish, for a moment, that I were a registered Massachusetts voter,” Wagley said. “I’m getting people excited, but I can’t vote for Scott Brown.”
Harvard students and Mass. residents who were able to get involved in the campaign efforts said that they felt special enthusiasm about making a difference in their home state.
“It was really special for me since people who aren’t from Massachusetts probably have Republicans and Democrats in Congress,” said Marissa A. Babin ’10, who made calls for the Brown campaign and attended local debates and rallies.
On the other side of the lines, Zoe O. Tucker ’13, who lives in Newton, spent the week before Election Day organizing phone-banks and encouraging other local Democrats to volunteer for the Coakley campaign.
“I feel differently about the results because I live in Massachusetts,” Tucker said. “I’ve always assumed it’s the liberal haven of America. [Brown’s win] really freaks me out.”
Tucker said that her experience with the Coakley campaign and her feelings of shock after Coakley’s loss have encouraged her to volunteer for another Democratic campaign over the summer.
“The midterm elections hadn’t really been on my radar,” Tucker said, “But now I’m realizing that every single person, every single representative is so essential.”
Both the Harvard Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club see Brown’s victory as a signal to similarly shift their focus towards the upcoming 2010 elections cycle.
“We’re going to work even harder to get Republicans elected not only in Massachusetts but across the country,” Isaacson said. “This is a warning shot to all Democrats, in all races.”
Depending on the interests of its members, the Harvard Democrats plan to focus on issues such as healthcare, education reform, and climate change, according to Berkenfeld.
“This loss can really be turned into an opportunity. It can really be a wakeup call,” he said. “We’re going to take that energy and take that passion and try to understand how we can have the biggest impact in 2010.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first week, Zachary C. Sifuentes ’97-’99 cooked “aji de garbanzos,” a spicy Bolivian broth with tomatoes and garbanzo beans that he served with white rice. Alongside the stew was a salad, and he made a sorbet with green mangoes, basil, and Thai bird’s eye chilies for dessert.
That morning, Sifuentes, an Adams House tutor and Expository Writing 20 preceptor, went to Whole Foods Market to buy ingredients—always vegetarian, usually vegan, and almost all organic.
The diners at this Jan. 7 meal were a group of around 14 Adams residents, including students who did not head home for the January term and were only able to enjoy a home-cooked meal thanks to Sifuentes. For the three-course meal, he charged students $5—less than the cost of a burrito in the Square.
As a result of these meals, Sifuentes says that people who normally do not interact with each other—be it because they live in different entryways or travel in separate social circles—have come together and “rearranged themselves.”
“You may see people in your entryway, but you have no idea who’s milling around,” he says. “We’re just trying to do things here in Adams House that bring people together.”
In the face of sparsely occupied residence halls and regulations that discourage some social activities, many House tutors and administrators are trying to promote a spirit of community during the College’s first-ever January Term, filling the void with activities in which students can bond over food, film, and friends.
A WINTER NO-MAN’S-LAND
Many J-Term residents say they sense a palpable air of desolation in the Houses caused by uneven occupation of the entryways and a lack of events.
“It feels like a ghost town,” says Jacqueline N. Nkuebe ’10, a Winthrop House resident who is staying on campus during January. “It’s nice that it’s quiet and also bad that it’s quiet, but I have some friends that are on campus.”
The silence filling the Houses can be explained, in part, by rules put into place by the College that ban parties and overnight guests. The regulations threaten non-compliant students with dismissal from housing this winter and potentially during future winters.
Then, there’s the simple fact that fewer people are in the Houses. Although a total of 1,316 students were granted January housing, Interim Director of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer said in October that the number of students at Harvard at any given moment would be around 1,000. With a total enrollment of 6,655 students at the College, according to the Registrar’s Office, that means less than one out of every six students has been present at a given time in January.
Not only are there fewer residents, but the distribution of students across some entryways appears to be skewed, with senior-heavy entryways being more populated because of students working on theses, according to Adams House tutor Matt J. Corriel ’05. He added that as some student groups, such as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, return to campus, the proportion of non-seniors to seniors has increased, ameliorating the imbalance.
But to those in the Houses, people still seem few and far between.
“I see some boys watching TV in the big TV room, and I’ve seen a few people in the JCR eating, but it seems like a lot less to me, less than I expected,” Dara B. Olmsted ’00, a tutor in Mather House, said of the number of students in the House during January.
IN SEARCH OF FOOD
To bring together students separated by vacant rooms and empty hallways, many Houses have held events to foster community, ranging from the large home-cooked meals in Adams House to Master’s open houses, smaller dinners, and study breaks.
House gatherings over J-Term largely centered around food, catering to upperclassmen tired of walking to Annenberg for each meal. As House dining halls are closed, Currier and Leverett Resident Deans each organized a House dinner. Cabot, Kirkland, and Lowell held s’mores study breaks.
Even at movie nights, many students came for the food. Winthrop House’s showing of the film “Star Trek” attracted 10 to 12 students, but a few just grabbed pizza and left, according to Nkuebe, a Winthrop resident.
“I thought it was a lot of fun, and it’s a lot better than trekking to Annenberg to get dinner,” she said.
But even with the prospect of food, not all of the events attracted many attendees.
Olmsted planned a movie night with snacks, announcing the screening of “The Proposal” over the Mather list three hours before the movie began. Only four people attended.
Mather hasn’t had any other planned events, so Olmsted has seen few students, she said.
“Supposedly there’s 80 to 100 students, but I’ve seen like 10,” she said.
LEADING THE PACK
While the majority of Houses offered one event at most, Adams House and Winthrop House both held at least three.
Each Wednesday, Adams House held weekly dinners. On Thursdays, Sifuentes organized a series of weekly dinner and movie nights, watching “Up” the first week after serving his Bolivian stew. The second week, they watched “The Bourne Ultimatum” after sharing a meal of lentil coconut soup, Chinese potstickers, and apple crisp.
Corriel also invited all Adams residents to watch the 20th anniversary episode of “The Simpsons,” though he said only two students showed up.
Winthrop residents watched “Good Will Hunting” and “Star Trek,” and feasted on Noch’s, Oggi, and Crazy Dough’s pizza at a “Symphony of Pizza” dinner night on Tuesday.
But even Winthrop resident Nkuebe said she wished there had been more J-Term events.
She mentioned MIT’s “Independent Activities Period,” their equivalent of Harvard’s J-Term. During the four-week period in January, MIT offers a mix of activities—including science fiction marathons, whisky tastings, and tango workshops—and a few classes for credit.
“When I think about J-Term, I think about my friends over at MIT who have a very well structured IAP,” Nkuebe said. “So comparing the two is easy to do. But I think Winthrop is doing a great job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the University experienced its first Harvard-wide January term break, Harvard Business School launched J-Term programming to help its students make the most of the new gap between semesters.
As part of the new programming, which began on Jan. 11 and ends today, HBS students had the opportunity to participate in intensive seminars, travel around the world through the Immersion Experience Program, or pursue other independent studies and opportunities.
First and second year MBA students could choose from eight intensive seminars, which were led by faculty members and focused on a variety of different topics.
Several participating faculty members said that these new seminars were a valuable addition to the MBA program because they provided an opportunity for students and professors to focus on topics not necessarily covered in traditional Business School classes and work closely together in an academic environment.
“These seminars allow faculty members and students to explore subjects that are not gone over in a class. They also provide an opportunity for faculty members to experiment with ideas for full-fledged courses,” said HBS Professor Arthur I. Segel, who led the “Success Through Failure” seminar. “It was a very useful experience for me and my students.”
Loeïz Lagadec, a second year MBA student who took Segel’s seminar, said that his seminar did not follow the business school’s typical method of teaching cases, allowing them to pursue an unusual topic of study.
“Failure is generally a topic that doesn’t get a lot of attention. Not many people want to write a case about it,” said Lagadec, who added that he enjoyed his J-Term seminar experience.
Over 400 Business School students participated in the nine faculty-led Immersion Experience Programs (IXPs) in locations such as China, Peru, India, and Rwanda.
Diego A. Comin, a HBS associate professor, led the Peru IXP, which focused on the effect abundant natural resources and tourism have on Peru’s economy.
“We have fantastic classrooms, but teaching about the world and learning through living in the world is very different. It really complemented the HBS education by bringing the case method to new level where you’re a part of the case,” Comin said.
Professor Joseph L. Badaracco Jr., senior associate dean and chair of the MBA program, said that the January term seminars and IXPs provided great opportunities for students.
“All these programs add tremendously to the breadth and depth of the HBS experience,” he wrote in an e-mailed statement.
In addition to the IXPs, Professor Robert S. Kaplan taught an Executive Education program this January at the Harvard Business School’s new Shanghai Center.
The facility, which officially opens in March, contains the Business School’s first classroom abroad. According to Kaplan, the space is an uncanny replica of an Aldrich Hall classroom.
The Shanghai Center was also used this month by HBS’s China Immersion Experience Program.

The Cambridge police are looking for a man with a machete.
According to Jennifer Flagg of the Cambridge Police Department, the man injured another adult male at the Pit today at 5:15 p.m. CPD is not currently able to provide a physical description of the perpetrator (Flagg said that the details posted by the Cambridge Chronicle are inaccurate).
The victim was treated for injury to the shoulder and released from the hospital earlier this evening.
CPD is still searching the Pit, Brattle Street, and the rest of Harvard Square for the machete-wielder. Flagg said pedestrians should exercise caution when walking on the streets.
