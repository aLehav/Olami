After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through his first four years as Harvard president, Lawrence S. Bacow largely stayed out of trouble with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, avoiding the sort of major controversies that brought down Lawrence H. Summers’ presidency 16 years ago.
But despite mostly positive or neutral reviews from faculty members, some say they are looking for someone from a different mold as Harvard prepares to begin the selection process to find its 30th president.
Bacow announced Wednesday he plans to step down next year, setting the stage for Harvard’s second presidential search in a decade. In interviews after his announcement, faculty members offered a wide range of hopes for Harvard’s next president: Some say they want someone from a different academic background, and many others vie for a candidate who will use the perch of the University presidency to tackle global social issues.
“We … need a leader who can mobilize our core academic resources and influence to tackle the increasingly grave local, national, and global problems – from deep economic disparities, to growing social injustices, to climate change dangers, to increasing national polarization around the value of higher education itself,” Suzanne P. Blier, a professor of Fine Arts and African and African American Studies, wrote in an email.
Some faculty members said they hope to see Harvard’s 30th president bolster the sciences and humanities.
“I think the new president has an opportunity to link the 21st Century skills — creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication — to the Humanities,” Romance Languages and Literatures professor Doris Sommer wrote in an email. “Looking for these skills should lead back to more opportunities to link the humanities with every other field.”
Bacow will step down next year after only five years in office, tying Summers for the shortest tenure since the Civil War. His departure, announced in an email to Harvard affiliates Wednesday, came as a surprise to some members of the FAS.
AAAS and Harvard Divinity School professor Jacob K. Olupona said the news of Bacow’s retirement came as “a big shock” to him and other faculty members.
“His retirement is a great loss not just for Harvard but for higher education in the US,” added Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, a Human Evolutionary Biology professor in an email.
Bacow joins more than half a dozen leaders in higher education who plan to leave their positions this year or next.
Blier wrote the challenges of the pandemic may have contributed to Bacow’s departure.
“In light of COVID and how well Harvard managed this period, perhaps the timing should not be such a surprise,” she wrote.
History professor Philip J. Deloria wrote in an email that Bacow “has been a steady hand at a challenging time,” praising his leadership during the pandemic.
“We ask a lot of our university presidents, and there are all kinds of structural problems that can prevent them from fulfilling our many expectations,” he wrote. “I can’t imagine anything less pleasant than guiding an institution through the last two years of pandemic, but Harvard has done so in a competent and reasonable way, and we can chalk much of that up to President Bacow’s leadership.”
Faculty members also praised Bacow for his attention to other global issues.
University professor Stephen J. Greenblatt wrote that Bacow was an “effective advocate for students from abroad, held hostage by irrational political forces of nativism.” In 2020, Harvard sued the federal government over immigration rules that barred foreign students from staying in the U.S. if they were not taking in-person classes, prompting the Trump administration to eventually change its guidance.
Sommer lauded Bacow’s “determination to confront the shameful history and legacy of slavery” at Harvard, adding that his contributions inspire her in her own work. Harvard released a report in April that acknowledged the University’s deep ties to the institution of slavery.
“I am encouraged that his leadership through the public taking stock of Harvard’s involvement will inspire us to develop reparative projects in our particular disciplines,” she wrote in an email.
Most faculty members declined to offer names of potential candidates, but two pointed to current FAS leaders.
University professor Irwin I. Shapiro offered Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs as a potential contender. Blier wrote that “if Harvard is looking internally,” FAS Dean Claudine Gay “has done an extraordinary job and would be a terrific President.”
Other faculty members said they want to see a candidate who comes from a different academic background than Bacow, who holds degrees in three fields in the social sciences: law, public policy, and economics.
Abraham “Avi” Loeb, a professor of Science, said Harvard should put a scientist in charge who also understands the “ethical issues” that “the humanities are needed to resolve.”
James Bryant Conant, Class of 1914, who served in Massachusetts Hall from 1933 to 1953, was the last Harvard president to come from a scientific background.
“The future of the University should reflect the challenges that we have, both in science and technology, but at the same time, combining the advances that we make in science and technology with new policies, with new ways to cope with the challenges that come from the humanities,” Loeb said. “There are ethical issues. There are issues of how to regulate some of the abilities that we have.”
Jill E. Abramson ’76, a senior lecturer in English who previously served as executive editor of the New York Times, said she hopes fundraising ability won’t be the “main prerequisite” for the position.
Instead, she said, Harvard’s 30th president should focus on bolstering the humanities.
“I’d like to see a president who values the humanities and might put some energy in trying to steer students into concentrations that are part of the humanities, because I think the humanities [are] a fundamental part of a good education,” she said.
Bacow came to Massachusetts Hall from an inside track: He served on the Harvard Corporation for seven years prior to his appointment as president and he stepped off the search committee that ultimately selected him in 2018 to be considered as a candidate for the job himself.
Loeb said he hopes the search committee will prioritize someone outside its ranks.
“What I really hope will happen now is that there will be attention to people from outside the search committee and attention to people who have vision and not just administrative experience,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing thousands of people in the National Mall in Washington, Harvard College rising junior RuQuan S. Brown ’24 took the stage at a March for Our Lives protest Saturday.
Condemning “broken, ignorant, and irresponsible” politicians who oppose gun control legislation, Brown said he had “no other choice” but to take his safety and the safety of others into his own hands, but found it nearly impossible to do when gun violence pervades everyday life.
“I thought that it might be through education, but we are unsafe in our schools,” he said. “I thought that it would be through leisure, but we are unsafe on vacation. I thought that it would be through career, but we are unsafe at work. I thought it would be through politics, but we are unsafe at our Capitol, too.”
On Saturday, thousands of attendees convened in roughly 450 marches across the country — including in major cities like Washington, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston — to urge lawmakers to take harsher federal and state action against gun violence. The protests were organized by March for Our Lives, a student-led movement that advocates for gun control legislation in the United States.
The rallies occurred in the wake of the deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, which killed 21 and 10 individuals, respectively.
Less than an hour after Brown’s call to action in the District, the crowd suddenly devolved into a panic as someone yelled, “gunshot.” Organizers quickly restored order after they discovered it was a false alarm. The individual was detained by officers and carried no weapons, according to a tweet by the U.S. Park Police following the incident.
Nevertheless, Alexandria R. King ’24, who attended the District rally, said the incident illustrated the gravity of gun violence.
“The issue we’re talking about is very deep and serious and can impact any American at anytime,” she said. “It seemed as though there might have been a situation where someone had a gun. The situation was resolved, but definitely set the tone.”
Closer to Harvard, more than a thousand people convened near the waterfront at Christopher Columbus Park in Boston Saturday afternoon to call for state and federal gun control legislation. Many attendees donned blue or white March for Our Lives shirts and carried colorful handmade signs — some of which read, “The NRA Has Bought Congress,” “In America the Only Thing Easier to Buy Than a Gun Is a Republican,” and “I Should Be Writing My College Essay Not My Will.”
“Let’s be clear: If you do not support life-saving measures like universal background checks, we will vote you out in November,” said Boston rally co-organizer Justin Meszler to the hundreds of attendees. “Yet we know simply voting is not enough. Every day, more mass shootings occur — over 200 mass shootings so far in 2022.”
“Every day that our elected officials offer thoughts and prayers instead of meaningful, tangible action is blood on their hands. We need federal action now,” he added.
The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed gun control legislation that would raise the minimum age for buying semi-automatic rifles and prohibit the sale of magazines with a capacity of more than 15 rounds. The bills, however, for which at least 10 Republican senators would need to vote in support, are unlikely to pass the U.S. Senate and become law.
A day after the March for Our Lives demonstrations on Saturday, a bipartisan group of senators announced that it struck a separate tentative agreement that puts forth modest gun reform and funds for mental health and school security measures.
Two of the deal’s chief negotiators, Senator Chris S. Murphy (D-Conn.) and Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas), called the deal a “commonsense, bipartisan proposal” in a joint statement. The deal would provide states with resources for “red flag” laws — which enable guardians or authorities to petition courts to withhold firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or those around them — as well as more robust background checks involving criminal record and mental health review for gun buyers aged 18 to 21.
Some organizers and attendees also noted the importance of passing state gun control legislation Saturday. Madeline J. Ranalli ’24, who co-founded the Boston chapter of March for Our Lives in 2018 and is a board member of the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, said she hopes attendees channel the passion they brought to the rally to push for legislative action in Massachusetts.
“I really hope a lot of the energy that people have brought around gun violence around the country gets really focused here at home,” she said. “We have a lot of priority bills in the State House that would make a lot of difference in terms of banning firearm manufacturing to other states, which is a huge problem here in Massachusetts.”
Though Massachusetts currently bans the possession of semiautomatic rifles, companies can still produce the weapons within the state for distribution elsewhere.
Harvard students also attended and helped organize the New York rally, which began in Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, and concluded at the intersection of Liberty and Broadway Streets in New York City.
“When I was at the front with the banner, one of the other organizers came over to me, and we literally looked back behind us and the entire bridge — I could not see the end,” said incoming freshman Jack Kelly ’26, who helped organize the rally. “So it’s pretty powerful to illustrate the people-powered movement that we have created here in New York City and New York state.”
At the Washington rally, March for Our Lives co-founder David M. Hogg ’23 pointed to gun control legislation passed since the organization was founded in 2o18 following the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
“This time is different!” Hogg said, leading the audience in a chant.
In some ways, according to attendees, the recurrence of mass shootings in schools is nothing new.
Elizabeth C. “Liz” Hoveland ’22, who attended the Boston march, said they remember when the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred, during which a gunman shot and killed 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.
“We were all in middle school when Sandy Hook happened, we were in high school when Parkland happened, and we were in college when Uvalde happened,” they said. “We have seen over and over and over throughout our lives mass murder of children and of innocent civilians.”
Hoveland said they do not feel optimistic that recent federal gun control bills will pass the Senate, adding that they had expected more legislation to be passed after the 2018 shooting in Parkland.
“I hope it’s different,” they said. “I don’t have a lot of hope right now. I don’t have a lot of optimism because I thought it was going to be different four years ago.”
Some organizers and attendees called on others to vote for legislators who support gun control in this year’s midterm elections, when all House seats and 35 Senate seats will be up for election.
Jaclyn L. “Jackie” Corin ’23, a co-founder of March for Our Lives, said change at the federal level will “take some time,” but is possible through voting.
“It is vital that people actually educate themselves about the stances of elected officials or candidates of elected office,” she said. “Because people’s lives are on the line.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thousands of Cambridge residents, tourists, and volunteers convened at Boston’s 43rd annual Dragon Boat Festival Sunday to celebrate the traditional Chinese holiday through vibrant festivities and boat racing on the Charles River.
Established in 1979, the celebration is the first and oldest dragon boat festival in North America. The event, which was revived after the pandemic stymied in-person efforts for two years, drew more than 20,000 visitors, according to Boston Dragon Boat Festival President Gail Wang.
Wang said she was “pleasantly surprised” by the high turnout following the festival’s resurrection for the first time since 2019.
“It’s just this feeling of returning to normal,” Wang said. “Returning to the beautiful site and seeing people enjoying the festival — it’s just very emotional.”
Forty-eight teams participated in the boat race this year, a drop from the last festival’s record-high 76 teams. Each team, composed of 16 to 20 paddlers, vied for a place in the national dragon boat racing championships, which will be held in New York in August. The teams rowed 39-foot-long dragon boats in a 500-meter race down the Charles, cheered on by crowds overhead on the John W. Weeks Footbridge.
Shutong Fan, who competed in the race for the first time as part of the University of Science and Technology of China’s team, called the festival “very impressive.”
“So many people are interested in our Chinese culture,” Fan said.
Attendees enjoyed food truck fare and zongzi — traditional Chinese rice wrapped in bamboo leaves — while spectating the boat racing event. Both the dish and festival commemorate the death of 3rd century B.C. poet and political leader Qu Yuan as part of a 2,000-year-long Chinese tradition, according to the festival website.
Throughout the afternoon, the event showcased cultural performances from several Boston-area Asian organizations, including traditional Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Indian dances, martial arts demonstrations, and Japanese Taiko drumming.
Samuel “Sam” Murdock ’23, who learned of the festival from a banner in Central Square, said he “loved” the lion dance – a traditional Chinese dance performed for good luck.
“Vivacious, bustling,” Adam V. Aleksic ’23, another attendee, said of the event. “It’s way bigger than I expected.”
Volunteers hosted cultural arts and crafts activities, including writing Chinese calligraphy, making paper lanterns, and wrapping fresh zongzi.
Summer J. Smentek ’25 said she noticed the tents along the river, which drew her to attend the event with friends.
“It was nice to check out the arts and crafts tables and, of course, get to see the boats,” Smentek said. “I really loved seeing the dancers and everybody performing.”
Wang said the festival’s mission is to promote the sport of dragon boat racing while uniting Asian communities in the Boston area.
“Forty-three years onward and look at us — we have performance and food vendors from many Asian communities,” Wang said. “It’s all getting together to support this event with communities from all around.”
