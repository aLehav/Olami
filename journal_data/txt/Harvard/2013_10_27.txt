After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
United States Secretary for Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan ’87 spoke about the impact that his volunteer experience at Harvard had on his career path in a speech in Memorial Church on Friday evening.
 
Donovan was the recipient of this year’s Phillips Brooks House Association Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award, which honors those who have demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service.
 
According to Cindy Y. Guan ’15, PBHA alumni and history coordinator, this year’s Coles lecture was also intended to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
 
“We wanted to honor someone who was both active in public service and passionate about fighting homelessness,” Guan said. “The work that Secretary Shaun Donovan has done made him the perfect candidate.” Donovan has spent his career advocating for safe, quality, affordable housing for many of America’s at-risk communities, tackling issues of homelessness and the recent housing crisis.
 
A former volunteer at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter during his undergraduate years, Donovan attributed his success to the impact PBHA had on him. “PBHA has a rich history of changing lives—including my own,” he said.
 
Donovan recalled a stark realization he had as a student after passing a homeless man on the streets of Harvard Square that helped him realize his commitment to ending homelessness.
 
“The gentleman—ragged from what he had been through—wasn’t holding a sign that asked for money or for work. He was simply holding a photograph of himself decades earlier as a memory,” Donovan said. “I thought to myself, ‘What kind of world is it that we live in, that somebody has to hold a picture of themselves to be seen?’”
Through community service, Donovan said he found a way to challenge social injustice by bringing those unseen out of the shadows. “For every invisible man, there is a blind person who refuses to see them for who they really are.” he said.
In an interview with The Crimson, Donovan emphasized the growing challenge of attracting students to careers in government.
 
“What worries me the most is that the recent Congress shutdown will turn off young, idealistic people towards public service and working in government,” he said. “For me, the hardest thing was to find government, and that only happened by luck. To overcome that, I would encourage people to give public service a chance.”
 
Finally, Donovan encouraged students to formulate their own career paths through meaningful public service.
 “All of us have different paths to find our way, so I can’t tell you what to do next or what your passion will be, but what I can tell you is to serve,” he said. “When you serve, you follow your passion. If you serve and you call yourself to be more than what you think you can be, this world can be more than what we think we can be.”

Harvard University has decided to fund elderly care services for the next 10 years for residents of the Putnam Square apartment complex, an affordable housing building in Cambridge formerly owned by the University.
 
Harvard sold the apartment complex, located on 2 Mt. Auburn Street, to the Homeowners Rehab Inc. in August. HRI, a non-profit organization, has pledged to keep the cost of living affordable for apartment residents for the next 30 years.
 
Payment for “aging in place” services will commence on November 1, although the exact cost of these services to Harvard is unknown. The Center for Disease Control defines “aging in place” as "the ability to live in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level."
 
According to University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall, Harvard’s services will include assistance with daily activities such as bathing and getting dressed, access to health insurance specialists, and various wellness programs—all “intended to help elderly residents maximize their independence and fill potential gaps with assistance in basic activities,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
 
“Harvard works with Cambridge in a variety of ways to support quality of life for residents, including programs in the public schools, housing, and supporting senior citizens,” Marshall wrote in an emailed statement. “As part of the transfer of the property to HRI, over the next ten years the university is providing wrap-around supportive living services for residents of 2 Mt. Auburn Street.”
 
Harvard will be providing elderly care services through local non-profit organization Somerville-Cambridge Elder Services, whose stated mission is to provide the elderly with the  “information, services and support needed to make choices which enhance health, well being and independence.” 
Marshall said that Harvard’s sale of the building to HRI was also structured in a way to allow ”timely capital improvements to the building,” The Putnam Square apartment complex is almost 40 years old, and several residents have complained to the Cambridge City Council about the decline of the building’s heating and elevator systems.
According to Cambridge City Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, who assisted in the sales negotiations between Harvard and HRI, residents were initially wary of Harvard’s decision to sell the complex because of the uncertainty surrounding continued elderly assistance after the sale.
 
Now, Reeves explained, “Tenants are quite pleased to know who will own the building and what services will be available to them.”

As the White House works to repair the technological glitches that impacted the rollout of the new online health exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, University Health Services has a clear message for students: think carefully before jumping onto a new plan.
The Affordable Care Act creates new options for students, including recently launched state-level health insurance marketplaces through which low-income individuals may find themselves eligible for subsidized plans or an expanded Medicaid program.
Harvard students will have more choices and, in some instances, access to cheaper plans. However, Melanie Green, associate director of Harvard University Health Services, said that not all health insurance plans are created equal.
“It is not enough to be covered,” Green said. “You have to be a more informed buyer about what your risks and limitations are. There’s a lot more you need to learn for yourself before you make a decision.”
Officials at HUHS worry that some students will find “catastrophic coverage” plans—or plans with low upfront costs but high deductibles when health problems arise—particularly attractive. Drawn in by low premiums, low-income students could find themselves facing the highest deductibles, Green said.
Even students who choose plans with lower deductibles may face limitations in finding care. Those who choose a plan on the exchange will need to find a primary care provider in the community, and students enrolled on Medicaid who travel abroad will not have access to the full range of care, Green said.
Currently, all students are automatically enrolled onto Harvard-sponsored insurance unless they can prove that their alternate plan provides comparable coverage. According to Paul J. Barreira, director of Harvard University Health Services, approximately 40 percent of Harvard undergraduate students and 80 percent of graduate students participate in the Harvard-sponsored BlueCross BlueShield plan.
Barreira acknowledged the complexity of health care reform and said the definition of “comparable coverage” for waiving Harvard insurance will be evaluated by HUHS over time.
“It’s going to be complicated, and students will have to do a lot of work to determine what their coverage will provide,” Barreira said. “We will be continually assessing what impact the ACA will have on HUHS in the coming months.”
Barriera said that the price of the Harvard plan may change in response to the new healthcare law, but that students need to consider the difference between cost and value.
In an email to The Crimson, UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker also said that students should understand the plans they are purchasing to ensure that it will meet all their needs.
“Choosing the right health insurance is an important decision, and we encourage students to carefully look into these options before making a decision,” Baker said.
Despite the new options for health insurance, all students will still have access to certain HUHS services covered under the Student Health Fee, including urgent care and Mental Health Services, according to Baker.
While students have until February 28 to decide whether they would like to waive Harvard-sponsored insurance for the upcoming spring semester, Dr. Barreira said he hopes students do their research sooner rather than later.
“For college students, the analogy is shopping week,” Barreira said. “You shop, you evaluate your options, and then at some point you have to decide: Am I  going to go on a new plan? This is an extended shopping week, with much more complexity.”

Down two sets to none, the Harvard women’s volleyball (10-7, 5-3 Ivy) team could see its potential five-game winning streak slipping away to Dartmouth (10-10, 3-5 Ivy), a team that they had handedly defeated in the first game in their Ivy League season.
The Crimson, however, fought back in tough fashion, beating the Big Green 25-21 in the third set, and just barely eked out the win, 26-24, in the fourth, a set that featured 9 ties. In fact, Dartmouth had a 24-23 lead before Harvard was able to pull even and eventually win the set.
Despite their efforts in mounting a comeback, the Big Green was able to pull out the win, 15-10, in the final set, as they capitalized on a 6-0 run during the final frame.
Freshmen setter Corinne Bain of Harvard narrowly missed out on her third straight triple double, notching 10 kills, 30 assists, and 9 digs. She currently holds the only triple-doubles in the Crimson’s history.
Sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace continued her strong performances as well, leading the team with 17 kills. Freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst and junior middle blocker Caroline Walters each added 12 kills
Dartmouth had star performances from freshman opposite hitter Emily Astarita and sophomore outside hitter Paige Caridi, who had 17 and 16 kills, respectively, and 11 digs each. Aiding their efforts was freshman setter Stacey Benton, who pitched in with 41 assists. Rounding out the Big Green’s offensive effort was senior middle blocker Elisa Scudder, who recorded 5 service aces.

The Harvard women’s hockey team took the ice for its regular season opener without 2012-13 captains Laura Bellamy ’13 and Jillian Dempsey ’13 or stars Josephine Pucci, Lyndsey Fry, or Josephine Piccard, all of whom are current practicing with the U.S. National Team. The Crimson also played without Kalley Armstrong and senior Elizabeth Parker, who were both out with injuries.
Instead, Harvard played with just one senior among only 15 skaters. But against Quinnipiac, all the losses didn’t hurt the Crimson. It had plenty of firepower.
Sophomore Dylanne Crugnale scored two goals, junior Sarah Edney tallied three points, and Harvard beat the Bobcats, 4-2.
Just over a minute after Quinnipiac had cut the deficit to one goal in the second period, Edney scored a power-play goal to put the Crimson up by two again. Later in the second, Crugnale stole the puck in the offensive slot, made a quick deke and sent a shot by Bobcat goalie Laden Chelsea to give Harvard a 4-1 advantage.
The Bobcats found a late goal in the third, but never really made the Crimson nervous again.
The young and short-staffed Crimson squad started the game slow, but found its stride in the second period, scoring four goals in 10 minutes. The first tally came 1:33 into the period Edney fired a shot at the Quinnipiac goal. Chelsea stopped the initial attempt, but junior Hillary Crowe was there to fire the rebound past Chelsea.
Harvard scored its second goal two minutes later in similar fashion. An Edney shot let to a battle for the puck right in front of the Bobcat goal. Eventually, Crugnale located the puck and got it by Chelsea to put the Crimson up, 2-0.
Within a minute though, Quinnipiac showed signs of life. Bobcat Morgan Fritz-Ward carried the puck along the boards before flicking a centering pass. Nicole Brown was there to redirect the pass by Harvard goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.
A tripping penalty 40 seconds later set up Edney’s goal. On the power play, the junior collected a loose puck, cut to the middle, and fired a snipe over Laden’s glove to give Harvard a 3-1 lead.
Crugnale’s second tally of the game two minutes later gave the Maschmeyer some insurance. The sophomore goaltender would not need it, stopping 19 shots to earn the win.
The win is Maura Crowell’s first as Harvard’s interim coach while Katey Stone takes the year off to lead the U.S. National Team in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. It could have major standings implications down the road. Harvard was predicted to finish third in the ECAC, while Quinnipiac was slotted fourth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this semester, we at The Back Page already took a look at some of the preseason hype surrounding this year’s men’s basketball team. With the squad returning seven of its main eight rotation players from last year, but also welcoming back seniors Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey, this year’s team looks—on paper, at least—to be better than last year’s. Throw in freshman Zena Edsomowan, the first ever top-100 basketball recruit to attend Harvard, and pundits have been high on this team coming into the season.
Since our last post, both of the team’s point guards—sophomore Siyani Chambers and senior Brandyn Curry—have landed on the Cousy Award watch list that honors the best point guard in the nation. Chambers started every game last year in Curry’s absence and was the first freshman to ever be named first team All-Ivy, while Curry was a second-team All-Ivy performer his junior year and led the Ivy League in assist-to-turnover ratio.
The team’s other backcourt member—junior Wesley Saunders—got even more national acclaim. On Oct. 10, Saunders was named to the Lou Henson Preseason All-America Team. The Lou Henson Award is presented annually to the top mid-major student-athlete in Division I. Saunders is the only Ivy League representative on the team and one of only six juniors to make the 25-man roster.
As a team, the Crimson was also a unanimous pick to win the Ancient Eight in the 2013-2014 Ivy League Preseason Media Poll. Harvard is the first team since the 2009-2010 Cornell Big Red to be a unanimous pick. Those Big Red made waves by defeating Temple and Wisconsin on the way to the Sweet Sixteen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a Princeton-filled weekend, Harvard field hockey (5-8, 1-4 Ivy) struggled in a hard-fought match against the defending national champion Tigers (9-4, 5-0) at Jordan Field.
Coming into the game, the Crimson knew it was in for an uphill battle. Harvard lost 7-0 to Princeton last year and the Tigers lead the all-time series 33 to five. Princeton’s pattern continued on Saturday, as the champions were victorious, 3-1.
In each of the Tigers’ previous 2013 Ivy League match-ups, they held commanding leads throughout. Prior to arriving in Cambridge, they had defeated Dartmouth 7-1, Yale 2-0, Columbia 5-0, and Brown 6-2. Princeton is undefeated in its last 18 Ivy games, chasing its own record of 24 straight from Oct. 2007 to Sept. 2011.
“We gave a little bit too much respect, so we were unable to push through,” said Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “If we had believed a little bit more in our strengths, I think there was more to get.”
The first Tiger goal came on a quick dish into the circle. Teresa Benvenuti had the rebound off an initial shot and squeezed it between Harvard senior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield’s legs.
However, the Crimson responded quickly. Junior forward Noel Painter had a hard shot off a pass from freshman forward Marissa Balleza to tie the score with 20 minutes remaining in the first half.
But it would prove to be too little as Julie Reinprecht and Cat Caro gave Princeton a lead they would not relinquish.
A Princeton yellow card in the first half and green card in the second gave Harvard a one-player advantage twice during the contest, but the team was unable to capitalize on either penalty.
Five more seconds in the first half would have seen the score tied at two as a breakaway led by senior forward Bridget McGillivray and Balleza gave the Crimson a last chance to even the score before the break. With the goalie several feet away from the net, the Crimson fell short, and time ran out before the team could get the ball in the back of the net.
The momentum at the end of the first period carried into the second, as Harvard wasted no time in getting the ball down the field and forcing a penalty corner. But a hard drive shot went just wide and the Crimson was unable to get the tip-in.
Following the team’s initial attack in the second period, Harvard struggled to stay on the offensive and the Tigers began to set the pace. Although the Crimson had several breakaways, the team was unable to hold onto the ball and was constantly in transition.
Defense was key for Harvard in keeping the game within striking distance. Alongside Hatfield, the back line had seemingly endless stick stops before the ball had a chance to reach Hatfield’s pads.
“I was really proud of our defense for just playing really great one on one defense, particularly Carly McNeill in the backfield, Dina, Sophie, and up through the midfield on their Olympic players,” Hatfield said. “We were really focused and had some good communication.”
One of Princeton’s strengths in keeping the Crimson at bay was burning time on the clock. When no midfield or forward passes seemed available, the defense would pass back and forth until a Harvard player would sprint for an interception.
“We are in a very different stage of where are programs currently are and I think we are much further than the team thinks they are which is a great thing,” van Herwaarden said. “We just need a little bit more confidence to compete with them on all fronts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final notes were the same, but the songs were completely different.
Just like last year’s rendition, the 106th edition of the Harvard-Princeton game ended with Roman Wilson catching a touchdown pass from Quinn Epperly.
But the teams playing in this year’s 51-48 shootout in Harvard Stadium shared few similarities with the squads that battled in Princeton Stadium in 2012. This year’s final-play loss was more impressive—and concerning—than last year’s collapse.
Last year’s Crimson team was led by the league’s Offensive Player of the Year at quarterback, an All-Ivy running back, and a tight end that is currently playing for the Baltimore Ravens—all seniors. Compare that to the group Harvard relied on down the stretch on Saturday.
Junior quarterback Conner Hempel returned from injury to lead Harvard with just three games under his belt. Senior tight end Cam Brate was often blanketed by double coverage, leaving Hempel to work with a limited set of weapons headlined by a backup running back.
Then senior center David Leopard went down with a leg injury, leaving senior Nick Easton to play the crucial position. Easton had never played center in a game before, and bad timing between him and Hempel led to multiple pivotal false start penalties. Hempel also lost slot receiver Andrew Fischer to a hamstring injury.
When the Harvard offense stalled on its final drive, it put the game’s fate on the leg of walk-on junior kicker Andrew Flesher, forced into action in senior David Mothander’s absence.
Flesher’s 51-yard attempt in the final seconds had the distance, but strayed wide.
That kick summed up the Crimson offense’s play better than I ever could. The effort was there, the talent was not.
The team’s first five games set expectations too high—this year’s squad is not last year’s. There was a reason Harvard was not picked to win the Ivy League in the preseason like it was before last year. The Crimson offense was far from a juggernaut coming into this season, and injuries along the line and elsewhere have only depleted Harvard further.
As the fourth hour of Saturday’s game slogged on, that became clear. It felt like Tim Murphy was trying to complete a puzzle without many of the pieces. Instead, he used the lint and spare button he found in the bottom of his pocket, and even tried to cram a CharlieCard into the puzzle.
For a long time, the replacements somehow hung with Princeton. The credit goes to guys like Hempel and running back Paul Stanton for keeping it close as long as they did. In the end though, Harvard didn’t have the requisite firepower.
That’s because the Tigers were also a completely different team this year.
Princeton’s offense last year was a Microsoft Zune—gimmicky and crude. Now it’s an iPod Touch.
Yes, the gimmicks were still there. The Tigers lined up with offensive linemen near the sideline and called more shovel passes than Stanley Yelnats in Holes. But, for the most part, the Princeton offense felt mature. Every play felt like it had a purpose; every player had a mission.
In the win, eight Tigers caught passes. Seven recorded rushing attempts. The absence of quarterback Conner Michelsen certainly forced more in-the-box thinking by Princeton, but you don’t record 520 yards of offense without a great offensive game-plan.
All that said, the real reason the Tigers have emerged from dormancy, at least according to Murphy, is the team’s defense. In a complete reversal from a year ago, it was the Harvard offense that needed a break to score for much of the game.
The Crimson got on the board when a pass bounced off a Princeton defender. It only tied the game in the fourth quarter after taking over 19 yards from paydirt. NFL prospect Caraun Reid hurried Hempel on back-to-back plays to prevent Harvard from making Flesher’s attempt at the end of regulation any easier.
For most of the game it was the Crimson, not the Tigers, that needed a short field, a controversial call, or a fluky play to get into the end zone.
In the third overtime, the Crimson got none of the above. On third and four, Hempel escaped a sack and scrambled for a first down. But faced with the same situation two plays later, the junior couldn’t recreate the necessary magic. Princeton held Harvard to a field goal, giving Epperly and Wilson the opportunity to drive the stake home once again.
Their touchdown connection likely earned the duo a two-headed bust in the Crimson Killer wing of the Princeton Hall of Fame, right alongside Doug Davis. It also shook up the Ivy landscape in a big way.
Last year, the Tigers’ upset of Harvard was a sign of things to come, but Princeton lost three games down the stretch to cough up a potential Ancient Eight title. Saturday’s win told the league that there is a new sheriff in town.
Sure, Penn is also 3-0 in league play, but take away the team names and one resume sticks out. The Quakers needed four overtimes to beat Dartmouth and topped Columbia by just 21 (the Lions have lost their other two conference games by an average of 51).
Meanwhile, the Tigers just defeated an Ivy heavyweight and have won their other two league games by a combined 68 points. Of course, Princeton will have to prove it is better than the other Killer P two weeks from now in Philadelphia.
For now though, the Tigers are kings of the jungle once again.
Saturday, Harvard didn’t collapse. It just was not the better team. For the Crimson, that has to be way more concerning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling behind in the first 10 minutes of play on a Princeton penalty kick, the Harvard men’s soccer team fought aggressively during the second half to leave Saturday’s competition victorious, responding with two goals in the final 20 minutes.
Extending its Ivy League win streak to three games, the Crimson (4-7-2, 3-1-0 Ivy) beat Princeton (5-7-1, 2-1-1), 2-1, at Soldiers Field Soccer and Lacrosse Stadium.Harvard’s win not only represented Princeton’s first Ivy League loss, but also handed the Crimson sole possession of second place, behind Penn.
Coming out strong in the second half, Harvard quickly began to pressure the Tigers and create scoring opportunities. After senior defender Ross Friedman put the ball in the box, junior defender Philip Fleischman headed it home in the 71st minute to tie the game, 1-1. Friedman’s 12th assist of the season vaulted him to the top of the conference in that category.
Freshman forward Daniel Smith’s first goal of the season sealed the Crimson’s victory with just over eight minutes left in the contest, following an attempt on goal by junior midfielder Matt Sheeleigh.
“It was a great service from the outside,” Smith said. “[Sheeleigh] won the first ball, and it just kind of fell right to me. I was lucky to finish it but I didn’t do the work.”
Despite an early deficit, Smith said Harvard wasn’t worried about its ability to make a comeback and followed its initial strategy to make the reversal a possibility.
“We knew that if we stuck to our game plan and just pressured them the whole field, they weren’t going to be able to handle us,” Smith said. “We had trouble in the first half, but we refocused at halftime and just got back to our plan. The whole season we’ve been saying it over and over. If we just stick to our process, then we know good things are going to come, and you’re seeing it now.”
Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer recognized the level of intensity his team put forth in Saturday’s game and attributed it to the determination and confidence the team has held throughout the season, despite failing to pick up a win in its first five matches.
“It was a great win,” Lehrer said. “I think these guys have worked so hard for this moment. I can’t tell you enough about their effort. They’ve been fantastic all year and now it’s come out in a result.”
A decisive conference game for both Harvard and the Tigers—combined with the effects of the strong wind and a raucous crowd—fostered a physical environment, resulting in five yellow cards and 34 fouls between both teams.
“We obviously want to get pressure to the ball whenever we can,” Lehrer said. “In order to do that we had to get tight; that’s a physical part of the game. I think the elements caused a little change in the game. When we came out of the first half we knew 1-0 down was not that bad with the wind, so I think given the physical part and the elements, we were in a pretty good situation at half and went from there.”
In Lehrer’s first season at the helm, the Crimson has already won more Ancient Eight games than in the last two years, where Harvard went 0-6-1 in conference games. Lehrer refused the credit for the team’s turnaround.
“We come in and we work hard,” Lehrer said. “We try to improve the process of what we do every day. If we’re struggling on one thing, we try to fix that, and we try to make sure we’re constantly improving our operation.”
With three games remaining in Ivy League play—including its season closer against first-place Penn—the Crimson will take it one game at a time and look to maintain its newfound success.
“Going forward, it’ll be business as usual,” Lehrer said.“[The team] is really good about their process on and off the field all year. Now that it’s starting to come together, what they continue to do will be no different. The confidence of the group is high but it’s been high. As they start producing wins, they gain more confidence, and they’re more difficult to play against, which is pretty exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down two sets to none, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (10-7, 5-3 Ivy) could see its potential five-game winning streak slipping away to Dartmouth (10-10, 3-5 Ivy), a team that it had handedly defeated in the first game of its Ivy League season.
“Coming into the game against Dartmouth, we knew that it was the first match of the second half of Ivy League play”, sophomore setter Hannah Schmidt said. “We knew that everyone would have stepped up their game, because we’ve all kind of played each other and knew each other’s style. We knew we were going to come in to higher competition than last time, and I think we got a little caught off guard in the first two games.”
But, the Crimson fought back in tough fashion, rallying to beat the Big Green 25-21 in the third set, and just barely eking out a win, 26-24, in the fourth, a set that featured nine ties and multiple lead changes. In fact, Dartmouth had a 24-23 lead before Harvard was able to pull even and eventually win the set.
“We just realized we were making a lot of errors… that we were able to put aside and realize that if we put [the ball] into the court, we could continue playing and let them make errors for a little while”, freshman outside hitter Grace Weghorst said. “We were able to keep the ball in play and make them make errors.”
Despite Harvard’s efforts in mounting a comeback, the Big Green was able to pull out the victory by taking the final set, 15-10, capitalizing on a 6-0 run.
“Going into the fifth, we were pretty confident”, Weghorst said.  “I don’t know if that got to us…it definitely did not go the way we wanted.”
“We went in a little too nonchalantly,” Schmidt added. “We got down ahead of time, and we worked our way back up…but once you’re down at such a high deficit, it’s hard to come back with such little time.”
Contrary to the final score, the Crimson was able to obtain more attacking opportunities and kills in each of the five frames. Correspondingly, however, Dartmouth was able to notch as many, if not more, blocks in each of those sets.
Freshmen setter Corinne Bain of Harvard narrowly missed out on her third straight triple-double, notching 10 kills, 30 assists, and nine digs. She is currently the only Crimson athlete to record a triple-double in program history.
Sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace continued her strong performances as well, leading the team with 17 kills. Weghorst and junior middle blocker Caroline Walters each added 12 kills of their own.
Junior outside hitter Kristen Casey led the defensive effort with 25 digs.
Dartmouth had star performances from freshman opposite hitter Emily Astarita and sophomore outside hitter Paige Caridi, who had 17 and 16 kills, respectively, and 11 digs each. Aiding their efforts was freshman setter Stacey Benton, who pitched in with 41 assists. Rounding out the Big Green’s offensive effort was senior middle blocker Elisa Scudder, who recorded five service aces.
One of the largest difference makers in this game was the disparity in blocks. Dartmouth’s sophomore middle blocker Kaira Lujan and Scudder both had three solo blocks, leading Dartmouth to a total of eight solo blocks. Harvard, on the other hand, was only able to record one solo block throughout the entire match.
The Crimson also faltered from the service line, as it had 14 service errors to their opponent’s four.  To add to this Harvard had three or more total errors than its opponents in all three losing sets.
“Because everyone changes their game plan, the second half of the Ivy Leagues is a whole different ball game,” Schmidt said. “Our coach had talked a little bit about how we have to work really hard in practice and see why we’re working for what we’re working for. We have to control our side of the court and not let what the other side does throw us off guard, and we have to play for our team and not just play to play the game.”
“It was a tough loss, but we’ll definitely be able to come back next weekend,” Weghorst added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than a week after a third place showing at the Ivy League Championships, the Harvard men’s water polo team headed west and produced three wins against Californian competitors at Santa Clara University’s Rodeo Tournament.
CONCORDIA 9, HARVARD 8
On Friday evening, the Crimson – ranked No. 19 in the nation – competed in the first of its five scheduled matches against No. 10 Concordia.
The Eagles, coming off of a 14-10 victory against Pomona-Pitzer two days prior, knocked in three goals in the first quarter. Harvard matched Concordia’s first quarter performance with three goals of its own, but was only able to score once in the second as opposed to the Eagles’ two.
The contest remained close throughout the second half. Both Concordia and the Crimson produced four points overall, with Harvard surging in the fourth period, scoring three goals as opposed to Concordia’s one. The late comeback, however, was unable to erase the deficit the Crimson found itself in at the end of the third quarter—after a final shot from freshman Joey Colton with 29 seconds left, the Crimson was forced to settle with a 9-8 loss.
SANTA CLARA 12, HARVARD 9
The next morning began with the Crimson facing No. 16 Santa Clara. Three ranks above Harvard, the team hosting the tournament proved to be more of a challenge than the opposition from Friday night.
In the opening minutes, Santa Clara managed to pull away by two, but two shots by freshman attacker Viktor Wrobel brought the Crimson within a point of the Broncos. An additional goal from Colton helped the cause, and the first quarter ended with Harvard trailing, 4-3.
The second and third quarters were repeats of the first—with each effort mounted by Harvard, Santa Clara managed to edge its opponent by a single point. The end of the first half saw the Broncos pulling away, 7-5. By the end of the third, the scoreboard read 11-8.
Sophomore Noah Harrison scored a goal in the opening minutes of the final frame, but the lone goal was matched by one from Santa Clara’s James Rude. Shortly thereafter, Harvard’s second match out West ended with a 12-9 loss.
HARVARD 11, CAL BAPTIST 10
After two unsuccessful contests against higher-ranked teams, Harvard reversed the losing streak against No. 17 Cal Baptist. With Colton and sophomore Ben Zepfel tallying the first three goals, the Crimson started strong and ran with the lead.
“Well, I think that we all looked at each other in the eye and realized that we had more to give at the pool,” Junior John Holland-McCowan said. “We can come together.”
The beginning of the second half was when Harvard really took off. Four different members of the Crimson – Zepfel, Colton, Harrison and freshman Dan Stevens – scored in the third quarter, with Zepfel notching two. The four-point lead was sufficient to ward off a late comeback by Cal Baptist, and a goal by Harrison in the final minutes secured Harvard’s first victory of the weekend, 11-10.
HARVARD 14, UC DAVIS 11
The final day of competition in California opened with the Crimson facing No. 11 UC Davis. Apart from Concordia, the Aggies were the highest-ranked ranked team to participate in the Rodeo Tournament.
In contrast to the match-up against Cal Baptist, in which Harvard opened with a lead and held it throughout, the Crimson spent the majority of the game either behind or tied with its opponents, excepting a few minutes in the first half. It wasn’t until the beginning of the second period that it pulled up to the performance of the Aggies.
But once Zepfel scored the first goal for Harvard in the opening moments of the third quarter, the competition was neck-to-neck. Every point scored by either Harvard or Davis was met with a score from the opposing team, and the two sides were tied four different times in that quarter alone. At the beginning of the fourth, the score was notched at 10.
In the end, Harrison and Colton produced. Scoring two goals apiece, Harrison and Colton helped the Crimson pull away while Aggie sophomore Philip Bates scored the lone goal for the opposing side. The game finished with Harvard on top, 14-11.
“One thing…is that we should play with anyone,” Harrison said. “And when we went out there to play that game, we went out with that mindset. We didn’t let them battle us and we continued to fight back to accomplish the victory in that game because we never gave up.”
The upset victory against Davis saw a balanced performance from the Harvard squad. A total of seven members from the Crimson managed to score, with Harrison leading the way with four points.
HARVARD 7, FRESNO PACIFIC 6
Four hours after the victory against UC Davis, the Crimson fashioned a solid first-half performance to secure its final victory before returning to the East Coast.
After scoring first, Harvard ran away to a halftime score of 5-1. Only two additional points by Zepfel and Colton in the third frame were needed to fend off a late surge by Fresno Pacific.
“We competed at a very high level,” McCowan said. “We left 3-2, and that was something Harvard [hadn’t been able to] say for a long time. We’re really proud [of] that.”

The crisp cold air of fall, filled with swirling, fiery leaves, brings back memories of a carefree childhood. But you can’t reminisce. In fact, your mind can’t complete one clear thought. Because that guy sitting in the next carrell in Lamont has to release an earth-shattering cough every other minute. And then the girl over by the window pierces the room with a sneeze at indescribable decibel levels. And don’t even start about the mysterious sniffles that, like a sharpened knife, slice through your ear drum even when you’re blasting Beyonce on your headphones.
Yes, it’s the season when everyone seems to be getting sick, and no one has the time to sleep it off. But here are some ways that you can save yourself from the coughs, sneezes, and sniffles—share them with your friends and do your part to help reduce the overall sick-noise level on campus.
1. Vitamin C overload.
People always talk about Vitamin C as a way to prevent illness. I, for one, hate those gross Vitamin C powder booster things that you add to water. But if that floats your boat, go for it. If you prefer the classic glass of orange juice, go for that, too. And when I say go for it, I don’t mean a dinky glass with breakfast. I’m talking a gallon, maybe two gallons, of Sunny-D at your side, ready to boost your Vitamin C levels far beyond recommended daily levels.
2. Sanitize. Everything. All the time.
Never forget that you are in a constant battle with evil microbial warriors that could care less about the two midterms and the problem set you have tomorrow. You have to arm yourself. It’s time to whip out that bottle of Purell your mom got you freshman year and buy at least a dozen packs of sanitary wipes from CVS. Latex gloves and hypoallergenic face masks would be preferable. Wipe down every surface you ever touch. Throw away used latex gloves on the hour. Frequent hand-washing is a must. And if you don’t have personal space issues, be prepared to use your sanitizing supplies on every person who even looks under the weather.
3. Take up a super-diet.
It seems that there is always talk about new so-called superfoods, and I feel like they always have to do with something called antioxidants, which sounds like a bad thing but are actually a really good thing. You can find a list of some of these "superfoods" here. If you can’t get a hold of the food itself, I’m sure substitutes will do. Instead of blueberries, try blueberry ice cream. Instead of pumpkins, try pumpkin pie. Instead of tomatoes, try pizza. (Wait, I’m not so sure about that last one…)
4. Put some Windex on it.
In the 2002 comedy “My Big Fat Greek Wedding," Gus Portokalos gave us perhaps the greatest advice for healthy living: put some Windex on whatever the problem is. It’s cheap, and it smells like chemicals, which means some sort of reaction must happen when you spray it. Hey, if it works for the guy Toula marries, then I’m sure it’ll work for you.
5. Become a bubble boy or girl.
If all else fails, and you feel like the germ onslaught is simply unmanageable, you can always order large sheets of sanitary plastic and cover every opening to your dorm room. Don’t forget to stock up on food and other necessities like a fridge, heater, and Dunkin’ Donuts iced cider. It would be helpful to build a tunnel of plastic to the bathroom. But make sure it’s been fumigated and sanitized before closing the stall off for your personal use.

Throngs of witches with broomsticks in hand wandered through the autumn air, weaving through crowds of wannabe 80s rockstars and skimpily-dressed Catwomen. This might seem like a scene from Disney’s 90s classic, "Halloweentown," but it’s a real sight in the town of Salem. On Saturday night, the Undergraduate Council sponsored a free Halloween outing to Salem, Massachusetts, home of the infamous witch hunts of the late seventeenth century, and I was one of the lucky few to go. A few minutes in Salem, and I realized how ridiculous the whole town looked, especially to a Californian like myself who has never before experienced this level of Halloween hype.
The tiny town was filled with elaborately dressed residents and visitors, from toddlers to grandparents, in just about every Halloween costume imaginable—from hot dogs to nuns to marijuana leaves.
“It’s a tradition, dressing up every year. There’s just so much energy in this town, and so many people walking around and so many new and cool costumes,” said a sixty-something Salem resident dressed as a marijuana leaf, whose name was impossible to glean.
Vendors selling fried, overpriced, and heart attack-inducing foods lined the streets of the town, and hundreds flocked to purchase French fries smothered in yellow cheese, fried onions and eggplant, fried dough, warm apple cider, and cinnamon rolls. Although there were probably a gazillion calories in the cheese fries (enough to make the freshman 15 a reality in a day) my classmates and I were glad to have a break from dinner in Annenberg.
I walked by the town’s graveyard, which was appropriately named "The Oldest Burying Ground in The City of Salem," and seemed to be as popular a tourist attraction as the John Harvard statue. Crowds of people descended upon the graveyard, disturbing the peace of famous figures from the past, including Capt. Richard More, a passenger of the Mayflower, and Justice John Hathorne, a relative of Nathaniel Hawthorne. (Fun fact of the day: Nathaniel Hawthorne’s actual House of the Seven Gables is another famous tourist attraction in Salem).
Meandering through the spooky city of Salem, with its 30-second haunted houses that had lines lasting more than an hour and its Halloween Carnival that literally consisted of one brightly lit Ferris Wheel, I couldn’t help but feel that the whole concept was somewhat absurd. Sure it was a nice escape from Cambridge—but not so much from annoying tourists taking pictures of every single thing in sight—and sure it was interesting getting hexed by hundreds of devilish witches, but I don’t see myself venturing out to Halloweentown again in the near future.

Some men grow mustaches as a display of masculinity. Others do it as a way to change their image or conform to urban style trends. But for the men of Harvard’s medical community, growing a mustache is about raising awareness and money for men’s health.
“Movember” is an international effort that seeks to raise money for men’s health—particularly prostate and testicular cancer—through the sponsorship of teams all over the world who grow facial hair during the month of November.
This is the third year that a team from the Harvard community has participated, but this year’s efforts come with a twist: if the team can reach its fundraising goal, Meir J. Stampfer, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, will shave his mustache.
According to Stampfer, this year marks the 40th anniversary of a mustache that is older than his marriage.
“Meir is a very famous man,” said Paul L. Nguyen, leader of the Harvard affiliates' Movember team and assistant professor of radiation oncology at Harvard Medical School. “He is one of the most cited men in medicine and everybody knows his mustache.”
“I will just do it if I can stimulate some interest in prostate cancer research even if it means shaving off my mustache, which is part of my identity,” said Stampfer.
As the rules of Movember stipulate that participants have to be clean-shaven at the beginning of November, Stampfer has refrained from taking part in the fundraiser in the past, choosing instead to remain a mustachioed “cheerleader” for the team. Stampfer has also been a leading author of prostate, colon, and breast cancer research.
“I’ve put my research into it; now I’m putting my upper lip into it!” said Stampfer.
“The whole concept of Movember is a different idea for cancer fundraising because it has a lighthearted step to it,” said Nguyen. With increased cutbacks to government funding, he said, it has become more difficult to get funding for continued cancer research, so fundraising efforts like these are particularly important.
As of late last week, the team had raised over $20,000 and, according to their Movember fundraising page, is currently in first place in the nation for fundraising. Team members are hoping to make it to their goal of $40,000 by October 30 in order for Stampfer to stick to his promise to shave his celebrated mustache. Stampfer joked that his kids considered having a counter-campaign against shaving his mustache, but said that they eventually conceded.
