After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MANASSAS, Virginia—You can’t get a good sour pickle in New York anymore. Not that I would know, my parents tell me. While it’s probably a good thing that abject poverty and infectious disease are no longer defining characteristics of the Lower East Side, a fact remains a fact—with the tenements eventually went the art of the sour pickle.
You can, however, still get your hands on a decent prune Danish, if you’re so inclined. When Juan at Andre’s Hungarian Bakery had wrapped one for me, I was ready to cross the Mason-Dixon.
I like to visit Virginia: it’s pretty and home to animals that aren’t rats-with-wings. But mostly I like Virginia because there, on a hill, are two eighty year-old kids at heart who love me very much. Fate and force of will have meant that my grandparents were never in one city for long. A little incongruously, they ended up in the American South, where a street urchin from Antwerp drives a tractor and a little Viennese girl cooks venison from neighbors’ hunting trips.
My bag slid forward as the Northeast Regional train ground to a halt. I checked to make sure that my vestigial pastry hadn’t been harmed. Then I looked out the window—Manassas, my favorite stop.
I understand, theoretically, that New York City is not somehow “exempt” from American history. British prison ships, draft riots, Boss Tweed—it feels wrong not to go on. But imagining Gotham’s past, I sometimes struggle to make out texture. It’s hard for me to accept that Peter Stuyvesant did not get off the boat and stop for “The Post,” or that the Battle of Brooklyn wasn’t over a parking space.
In part that’s because, for me, the city’s a little soiled by the routine of everyday life. But it’s also because the historical dust has little time to settle before it’s kicked up by pedestrians and cabs in the conversion of present to future.
Virginia is different. It doesn’t seem to break character. Looking out at Manassas, I could conceive of Thomas Jackson becoming Stonewall at the First Battle of Bull Run; I could imagine seeing bearded infantry, bayonets, and hardtack and hearing the “Battle Cry of Freedom” (which was written a year later, but just go with it).
I’d be lying if I said that I found all history interesting—there was some stuff about ancient clay pots in tenth grade that I could have done without. Often it’s the truly tragic that holds our attention: the hinges of the doors to the past are greased with blood. But I like to remember. And, I like to think (and by “think” I mean steal from the Gettysburg Address) that it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
A few stops later, I got off the train and into my grandparents’ Jeep. We drove from the Charlottesville station to their rural house, built in 1824. I wondered what its first owner, a sea captain who freed his slaves upon his death, would make of us—a bunch of foreigner-Yanks whose life circumstances were determined by a war between the European states—enjoying his Virginia. But as my grandmother bit into her Danish, I also didn’t care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Freshman Dean’s Office has filled the vacancies created by the departures from the office of three of its four freshman resident deans this summer.
Michael C. Ranen, who has previously served as a resident tutor in Winthrop House and an assistant dean of student life at Harvard Summer School, has replaced William Cooper ’94 as Ivy Yard’s resident dean. Jasmine M. Waddell, who was most recently an assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has filled Sue Brown’s former role as resident dean of Elm Yard.
Madeleine A. Currie, a former proctor, was appointed in the spring to fill the role vacated by Oak Yard’s most recent dean, Jonas V. Clark.
The FDO learned this past academic year that Cooper and Clark would be departing, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. Cooper will leave to defend his dissertation before considering new professional options, while Clark will attend the Yale School of Management.
Dingman said that the FDO learned at the start of the summer that a third resident dean, Brown, would also be leaving the FDO. Brown now works in the Advising Programs Office, serving as associate director of advising programs and assistant dean of the College.
The three new freshman resident deans, who have all since started work, who were chosen from a “deep and talented” pool of 152 applicants, Dingman said.
“They’re filling big shoes. We had a terrific team, but I’m very excited by these appointments,” Dingman said, adding that the new deans come from a variety of backgrounds and will bring different perspectives.
Ranen said he is looking forward to working with the incoming freshmen alongside their proctors.
“We have a chance to really shape their Harvard experience,” Ranen said. “And how their experience is during the first year can hopefully lead to more great things as they enter their Houses. I’m excited that they come into the Yard totally fresh and excited and ready to explore new opportunities.”
Ranen added that he hopes to “contribute in a positive way” to the College’s ongoing discussion about academic integrity. This past semester, the Committee on Academic Integrity proposed a five-point honor code, which, if approved, would be Harvard’s first-ever honor code.
Ranen said that as an undergraduate at Haverford College, he worked closely with the school’s acclaimed honor code.
For her part, Waddell said the process of matching students with their roommates and entryways has been “a great way for me to get to know Harvard, the Yard, the College, etc.”
With the three departures, Catherine R. Shapiro of Crimson Yard will be the only one of last year’s resident deans returning to the FDO. Still, Dingman said he is optimistic that the new deans will make a strong team for the Yard.
“I think because we hired people with real-world experience and significant maturity, I feel very confident that they are going to hit the ground running,” Dingman said.

Breakfast sandwich lovers, fret no longer—Clover plans to reopen the doors of its restaurants Thursday.
 
The health-conscious fast-food chain closed all of its operations over a week ago after learning that some people in Massachusetts who had contracted salmonella had eaten at Clover.
 
But on Wednesday, Clover founder and CEO Ayr Muir wrote on the chain’s blog that its four restaurants, including its Harvard Square location on Holyoke Street, would be re-opening Thursday. (The vegans of the world were disappointed when Muir’s Tuesday announcement that Wednesday would be the big day proved overly optimistic.)
 
As an added bonus, the window of the Harvard Square location is advertising free fries for Thursday’s lunch customers.
