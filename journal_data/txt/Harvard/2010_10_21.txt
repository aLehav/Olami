After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Critics have reacted angrily to a new iPhone application that uses facial recognition software to rate attractiveness of people by analyzing symmetry and other features. The app issues a rating from one to 10 on its “ugly meter,” with a score of one being the most desirable. Citing the possibility that, in the hands of children and adolescents, the application may become a tool for cyberbullying, some have called for the application to be removed from the iTunes store or restricted from being purchased by minors.
Cyberbullying is certainly a serious issue about which children should be educated, but banning the application would, in this instance, be an inappropriate way of teaching through censorship. Instead, parents and teachers should look to more substantive ways of teaching students about bullying and what constitutes responsible technology use.
Censoring content is sometimes necessary in particular situations, but the existence of the Ugly Meter application is simply not one of them. As stated by its creators, Ugly Meter is all in good fun: The humorously snarky messages that the ratings generate—a rating of 9.4 merits the comment, “You look like you ran a 100-yard dash in a 90-yard gym”—strike a joking, rather than malicious, tone. Moreover, the application does not include anything that is traditionally considered inappropriate for children, such as images or references to sex or violence.
Although some people understandably might be offended by this type of application that has no meaningful use and carries with it a high potential for hurting feelings, making a fuss about it does little to address the root cause of concern—the high incidence of bullying among students and the way technology is increasingly used to facilitate such bullying. However, if we expend energy attacking everything that could possibly be deemed distasteful, we risk diluting efforts to target truly offensive behavior. The Ugly Meter application is not problematic on the same scale as other misuses of technology and should not be lumped together with more serious cases.
The existence of the Ugly Meter application does make clear the increased need to educate kids about technology as the age at which individuals are exposed to the Internet and applications steadily becomes younger. Parents should ultimately be the ones monitoring the type of material their children are exposed to, as they can grant or forbid access to new technology. In the school environment, educators should also look out for their students’ well-being.
The openness of the Internet and the rapid progress of technological development mean that there could be a hundred different potentially dangerous or offensive applications or technological creations tomorrow that we would not have anticipated today. Educating children about every new technological development would therefore be an impossible and pointless task. Thus, rather than focusing on specifics, educators should stress the importance of teaching students guiding principles that would result in respectful and responsible technology use overall.
For better or for worse, children and adolescents will likely encounter technologies as problematic as, or more problematic than, the iPhone Ugly Meter application at some point during their lives. Empowering children to make thoughtful judgments about such potentially harmful items is more valuable in the long term than hiding them away.

Let’s consider the following scenarios. A religious community in a first-world country wants to build a worship and cultural center in one of the country’s largest cities. Another religious minority in a third-world country wants to renovate its temple of worship in said country’s capital. Which group is more likely to have their plan seen to fruition? Now, if I told you that the second scenario refers to Lebanon’s Jewish community, which has dwindled from 28,000 to about 300, you would certainly go with option number one. And you would be greatly mistaken. Recently, with regard to accommodating religious minorities, this Middle Eastern country has proven to be formidably tolerable, even more so than the U.S.
The United States is held to be the land of opportunity, equality, and freedom. Personal freedoms are an important aspect of American culture, especially when it comes to freedom of religion, a right protected by the First Amendment. But in the discourse surrounding the 2010 midterm elections, some Congress hopefuls seem to have forgotten that such a freedom exists in this country. Moreover, when the Park 51 project—questionably nicknamed the “Ground Zero Mosque”—was announced, Americans were divided on the issue. Many people opposed the project because it would be “insensitive” toward the victims of 9/11 and their families. Even though America’s Muslim population numbers around a couple million, some Americans have yet to learn to distinguish between Islam and Al-Qaeda.
Lebanon, on the other hand, is a sectarian country, where politics and religion go hand-in-hand. Lebanon has been torn by civil wars for most of the last 40 years—mostly dictated by religious affiliation—and regional disputes. Starting in 1975, a civil war broke out, and neighboring countries joined in the fighting later on. Beirut, then, was divided between west and east, Muslims and Christians respectively, with snipers guarding both sides of the dividing line. Jewish-majority Israel was a major player in that era and still is. It has been at war with Lebanon since 1948, has invaded Beirut in 1982, and was even in control of the South of Lebanon until 2000. More recently, a war broke between the two countries in 2006. Almost 3,000 Lebanese citizens were killed in 33 violent summer days. Yet, when Lebanon’s remaining Jewish community decided to renovate their synagogue in downtown Beirut, the Lebanese community and government support their cause wholeheartedly.
The Jews of Lebanon have been through a great deal, and their situation worsened as the conflict between Israel and Lebanon intensified. Most of them have since emigrated, some to Israel. Of the remaining, few demonstrate their Jewish identity, and some have destroyed any documentation that refers to their religious belief, in fear of any backlash from a then disgruntled population. So when they proposed a plan to restore the Maghen Abraham Synagogue to the government in 2008, the broader Lebanese community was skeptical that their project will ever come to fruition, especially with Hezbollah in the government. However, Hezbollah, believed by the U.S. to be a terrorist organization, has supported the project, explaining that it “respects all divine religions, including Judaism.” An official from the militant group made clear that their “problem was not with the Jews, but with Israel.” Now, the synagogue is receiving the final touches before being opened.  Although the Lebanese have a long way to go before they restore their Jewish community, the renovation on the synagogue is an important step in the right direction.
Regardless of the political conflict that Israel has with Lebanon, in this case, the Lebanese made a clear distinction between faith and national loyalty. Such a distinction is lacking in the U.S. Americans need to understand that Al-Qaeda’s crimes cannot be attributed to Muslims in general. In brief, it seems as if tolerance is one area where the Lebanese have the Americans beat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a warm Friday night last month, I found myself standing on the roof of a building in Jerusalem’s Old City with a group from my university. As the sun was setting behind us and we were chanting a beautiful poem by a 15th century Safed mystic to welcome in Shabbat, the day’s Ramadan fast ended with a bang. As the smoke from the Ramadan cannon evaporated over the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Christian quarter, the sounds of hundreds of Yeshiva students singing and dancing towards the Western Wall intermeshed with the Muslim call to prayer over loudspeakers.
At sublime and spiritual moments like this, it is extremely tempting to conclude that all three of these religions are, as the saying goes, “different paths up the same mountain.” To temper an age of profound religious tension—an age of Islamic centers near Ground Zero, convents near Auschwitz, and synagogues in Hebron—many writers and philosophers have argued that all religions, despite their varying rituals, boil down to nothing more than an exhortation to sympathize with the other. Karen Armstrong, for example, noted scholar of religion, argues that all religions began with the simultaneous realization of the golden rule, and the Dalai Lama back in May penned an op-ed in the New York Times in which he asserted that the “strong unifying thread among all the major faiths” is an otherworldly focus on compassion. But as Boston University Professor of Religion Stephen Prothero correctly argues in his book “God is Not One,” this notion not only denies reality, but actually fosters far more misunderstanding than it intends.
The belief that all religions are the same at their core runs not only through religious academia but also popular culture. In the “Lost” series finale, for example, Jack finds himself in a church that features a stained glass window with a crucifix, yin-yang, Star of David, and Islamic crescent and star. A few moments later, Jack’s deceased father appears and tells him that the church is in fact a purgatory in which souls linger before entering the afterlife. All religions, it is implied, will lead one to the same “church” eventually. Similarly, at the end of Dan Brown’s “The Lost Symbol,” Harvard Professor Robert Langdon discovers that all major books of religion feature clues to the “ultimate truth,” that is, the notion that all of humanity is “at-one-ment” with God.
The problem with this pleasant-sounding philosophy, Prothero argues, is that it encourages people to remain ignorant of the genuine differences between religions. It’s not just that different religions provide varying answers to the same question, Prothero asserts, but most religions aren’t even asking the same questions. “Only religions that believe that God is all good ask how a good God can allow millions to die in tsunamis,” he argues, and “only religions that believe in souls ask whether your soul exists before you are born and what happens to it after you die.” Rather than simply positing that all religions point to the same truth, Prothero outlines a pedagogical approach for comparative religion that identifies a problem that each religion is trying to solve, a solution to the problem, a technique for implementing that solution, and exemplars who have already charted the path.
This extremely mature method of examining religion takes the good along with the bad of every belief system and shapes the data into a much more accurate picture than the sanitized version espoused by writers like Armstrong. Take Islam, for example. If compassion lies at the center of Islam just like it does with every religion, as the Dalai Lama argues, then it is extremely hard to fathom why some Muslims would crash airplanes into office buildings or detonate themselves in pizza parlors. Obviously, His Holiness is justified in arguing that fanatics shouldn’t define the whole religion. Indeed, a recent Gallup poll demonstrated that 93 percent of the world’s Muslims are moderate. Still, to deny that radical Islamists do not follow the Prophet as well is to deny reality.
Now take Prothero’s approach. The word “Islam,” he points out, means “submission,” as in total submission to God’s will. But what, exactly, does God want? Does He want His followers to take Koranic verses such as “fight you therefore the friends of Satan” or “believers, fight the unbelievers near you” literally? Is Islamic law like a living constitution, as some Progressive Muslims might argue, or must a Muslim oppose the Western world and live as his forefathers did in the days of early Islam, as the Taliban argues? Such varying interpretations and nuances within the same religion only become apparent when one understands that compassion is far from the only pillar in religiosity.
All of this aside, Prothero does concede that there is one quality that unites all belief systems. “Every religion,” he writes, “asks after the human condition. Here we are in these human bodies. What now? What next? What are we to become?” As I discovered that evening overlooking the Old City, there are times when, in the midst of a beautiful harmony of different races, creeds, and dogmas attempting to achieve transcendence, one can do nothing but stare and wonder. Before the incredible majesty of the universe, we are all naught but flesh and blood.

To the editors:
Bottled water and its role on campuses has become a topic of great interest—and sometimes, heated debate. The Crimson’s Oct. 13, 2010, editorial “Bottle It Up,” which advocated for a ban of this healthful beverage choice, showed that Harvard University is no exception. I hope to provide some much needed clarification on the issue from a viewpoint you may not have heard yet.
In an age when American adults consume 450 calories a day from beverages and 68 percent of those 20 years old and older are classified as overweight or obese, bottled water provides a healthy choice when tap water is not accessible, preferred, or convenient. But if bottled water is not available, consumer research shows that more than one-half of people would choose soda instead. This means a ban on bottled water would have the unintended consequence of driving people to consume more unhealthy beverages that add calories and sugar to their diets.
While few can argue about the health benefits of “water,” college students and administrators may question the impact of “the bottle.” To better understand the environmental impact of bottled water and other beverage options, Nestlé Waters, a member of the International Bottled Water Association where I work, commissioned a first-of-its-kind, peer-reviewed life cycle assessment. This LCA found that bottled water has the lightest environmental footprint of all packaged beverages. This means that every time people choose bottled water instead of a packaged beverage such as soda or a sports drink, they are choosing a beverage that uses less water and energy. So banning bottled water is not only the wrong move for our health, but also the wrong move for the environment.
It’s also important to note that bottled water is not an either/or decision for most consumers; 70 percent of bottled water drinkers also drink from the tap. Simply put, people want access to clean, high-quality drinking water as part of their daily lives, and that is a good thing. Bottled water is an important choice in situations where there is a lack of water fountains or concern about water quality. You may recall bottled water’s key role during the boil water alert last May, which impacted about two million people in Massachusetts.
In sum, banning bottled water does not address the challenges students or other activists seek to resolve by demanding such a measure. Such bans do not improve water conservation practices, nor do they increase the diversion of plastic beverage containers from landfills. Rather, these bans succeed only in removing one of the most healthful beverage choices and replacing it with less healthy options that require more plastic and more water to produce than bottled water.
I hope you will reference this information and consider all the facts when evaluating whether or not any type of bottled water ban is in the best interest of your student community.

To the editors:
We would like to respond to the Crimson’s Oct. 4, 2010 editorial, “Separation of Church and State.” The Harvard Chaplains see great value in education about religion in the public sphere.  Broad knowledge of the world’s religions helps us all to better understand current events, making us more enlightened citizens.  It’s a guide for personal maturation and allows us to value the wisdom contained in other systems of belief.
On Columbus Day, the Harvard Chaplains sponsored a “Congress on the Future of Faith at Harvard.”  Harvard students and chaplains discussed the challenges of a pluralistic response to a religiously diverse culture, the difference between tolerance and engagement, and the need for appreciation of universal values while maintaining important particular differences.
We could not have had those lively and helpful discussions without awareness of and respect for other traditions.  Our religious bodies and ethical societies communicate belief in depth to their adherents.  However, the curricula of primary and secondary schools transmit the fundamentals of culture that contribute to the health of a society through the sharing of ideas. The influence of world religions on history and on life belongs in our schools.
The more we know and appreciate, the better off we are in dealing with the sweeping trends of culture, and how best to receive new neighbors who have different customs.
REV. DON LARSEN,
ON BEHALF OF THE HARVARD CHAPLAINS

Last Thursday, the Lowell House Committee decided to shake up the campus dating scene and raise money for charity at the same time via a date auction in the dining hall. The crowd swelled to as many as 130 Lowellians who cheered and heckled, hooted and hollered, and felt free to take advantage of the open bar. The atmosphere was a little subdued as House members first entered the dining hall, but MC’s Sophie C. Sakellariadis ’11 and Ryan J. Solis ’11 quickly got the crowd going as they auctioned off single house members, House masters, tutors, and even a dog, all the while blasting Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. Most of the prospective bidders cited their friends and supporting Lowell as their reasons for attending, but some members saw the possibility of real love in the air.
“I’m here for some hot, hot man meat,” said Afoma C. Umeano ’13.
“Lowell residents are the most attractive people on campus,” Siena R. Leslie ’12 concurred.
Indeed, the people up for sale were not shy about showing the audience the goods they were offering. Three of the Lowell Belltower Boys stood bare-chested on stage and were rewarded with a $55 selling price—a package deal.
“My girlfriend doesn’t mind,” said Alex L.G. Hugon ’11, one of the Belltower Boys.
Michael K. Oberst ’12 revealed his silk Harvard boxers to the crowd’s delight and got $45 donated for his troubles, while Jacques, a House dog, advertised as “the only date who will sleep with you,” netted a $60 contribution. Proceeds were divided equally between Lowell’s HoCo and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. At the end of the night, audience members trickled out, some with their wallets a little lighter, but no one regretting putting their hearts on the line in the name of House spirit.

Let’s say you’re walking back from Lamont at 2 a.m. when your book falls into a huge puddle. And let’s say the book is a hundred years old, one of the few left from the original round of publishing, approved by Sartre or DuBois themselves. Feeling screwed yet? Try 617-240-2500, which directs you to one of the 17 members of the Library Collections Emergency Team, which exists for the sole purpose of swooping in to undo your carelessness. These specially-trained employees have day jobs in Widener Conservation Services or the Weissman Preservation Center, but when on-call, they have the emergency cell phone turned on and with them at all times.
“It’s in my pocket or next to my head while I am sleeping,” said team co-chair and unsung hero Jane A. Hedberg.
Team members are supposed to respond within 20 minutes, but if it just so happens that the call does not get through, the University Operations Center takes charge of the problem along with their responses to more routine safety and crime issues. The Team has at its disposal three freeze dryers on campus, one of which is stashed in the basement of Widener. These special dryers can sublime water out of up to 600 wet books. If they run out of room, library materials can be shipped to a private freeze-dryer company in Texas.
“It sounds pretty cool. As to whether it is economically efficient, I have my doubts,” said Alan A. Ibrahim ’11, a student supervisor for Lamont circulation. Other students think of it as a last resort.
“I would use this in desperate times for desperate measures, but other than that, probably no,” said Jowanna R. Malone, ’13.
Little do these students understand that the puddles are waiting.

“This is not the Met, and this is not Lincoln Center. This is Apollo Night.”
With these opening words, M.C. Justin A. Dews ’11 reminded a packed Lowell Lecture Hall what the Black Student Association’s Apollo Night was all about—leaving proper concert etiquette at home and coming ready to cheer, jeer, and heckle.
“Boo with vigor!” he said.
The first act, a four-piece band performing an original song, started the show off on the right foot and garnered generous applause. The next three acts were not so fortunate. A trio of vocalists was the first group to get booed off the stage, swept off by the evening’s stage janitor: Sandman, or Everton L. Blair ’13, who was decked out in long cotton socks, purple suspenders, a yellow shirt, and a garish pink and blue baseball cap. Next, a spoken word  performance quickly went downhill after an unforgivable stumble. She too was swept off by the broom-wielding Sandman, as were Da Stank Sistahs, a trio of exuberant dancers who couldn’t quite get their act together. During intermission, an impromptu dougie contest was announced, enticing two audience members and Sandman to go on-stage and perform. The winner of the contest and a free T-shirt was Iguosadolo O. Nosamiefan ’14.
“I love dougieing,” he said. “I wasn’t going to go up, but I couldn’t resist.”
In the second half, only several acts were booed off-stage, and the eventual winner of Apollo Night, Wesley A. Gordon ’13, delivered a show-stopping oratory entitled “Love and Lust” that was met with a standing ovation. Finally, at the end of the night, attendees flooded the stage to dance as organizers and BSA affiliates cleaned up. The evening’s entertainment had concluded, the party was just about to start, and the reviews were already in. Janell J. Holloway ’13, the organizer of the event, was happy with the results.
“They didn’t pull off a lot of the acts they were supposed to, but I was backstage checking the Twitter feeds of attendees,” she said. “The response was overwhelmingly positive.”

Under a clear blue sky last Wednesday, a crowd appeared in the Harvard Community Garden, lining up at a red-and-white tent and hoping to get their hands on a delicious organic grilled-cheese sandwich. Was the cheese being distributed out of sheer benevolence? Not quite—the event was run by Generation Organic, a group of young farmers from across the country campaigning to promote organic and sustainable agriculture.
“It’s a constant educational fight,” said Silas J. Hundt, a farmer from Coon Valley, Wis. “It’s not simple to explain why people should pay an extra dollar for organic milk.”
Generation Organic is sponsored by Organic Valley, the largest cooperative of organic farmers in the US. Their goal is to create a system under which small, organic farms can have longevity and economic stability. That goal requires public education and awareness, which Organic Valley is promoting through its nationwide tour.
A glass jar filled with emerald pesto sat next to the grills, which cranked out sandwiches for the event’s attendees. The pesto was prepared by the Office of Sustainability, which helped to organize the event, according to Rachel E. Johnson ’09 of the Office’s Occupant Engagement Team. Many of the event’s attendees may have come for the grilled cheese, but there were also a fair share of environmentalists in the crowd. T. Fettah Kosar, who works at the Harvard Center for Nanoscale Systems, said, “I try to give the right lesson to my kids.” He has two young children and has become increasingly worried about antibiotics and pesticides in food. When he saw the colorful Generation Organic bus next to the Harvard Community Garden, he decided to stop by and learn more about the organization.
“It’s almost impossible to be 100 percent organic,” Kosar said. “So whenever I see organic events, I try to stop by.”

Hot TFs are great because they’re basically like the boyfriend you wish you had. They have to be polite to you, and they’re available by e-mail or phone 24 hours a day. If you want, you can bother them while they’re working, or they might even meet you for coffee. I’ll admit—I usually dread the endless hours I spend in section every week, except when I’m lucky enough to be placed in the coveted section with the hot TF.
Another important plus is that your first meeting with the hot TF is never awkward because you’re bound to have interests in common, even if they’re slightly obscure topics, like natural disasters or the molecules of life. Your hot TF is also probably hotter than your real boyfriend, and smarter, which only makes you want him more.
If things ever did actually work out between us, I think I would pretty much be guaranteed an A in the class (we would probably have to break-up if I was only worth a B+). But even if things aren’t meant to be, I always do all the reading in classes with a hot TF in order to avoid potentially embarrassing situations. Then, at the end of the semester, I suddenly realize that I’m actually prepared for the final, and I end up with an A anyway. I usually stop by his final office hours a couple of times anyway, though—just in case.

He’s sweet, kind, funny, charming, absolutely gorgeous and we met in class, but there’s just one problem: he’s my TF, as in Totally Fuhgetaboutit. Taking a class with a hot TF? Drop it, or say goodbye to both your academic career and your social one. I said bye to mine a long time ago.
Don’t get me wrong—I love staring at that chiseled, dreamy face at 5 p.m. every Wednesday, but not when my notebook is filled with middle-school style hearts, all containing the words “K <3s G 4ever,” instead of Marx and Weber. And then when he asks me to stay after class, I get excited, only to learn that I bombed a paper and now need to go to office hours. I spend more time lining my eyes with eyeliner than I do outlining my next paper. Why couldn’t this be a class on human anatomy?
And what if after all of my near obsessive attempts at seduction and telepathic communication, he flirts back? It’s nice, until I remember again that HE’S MY TF. You might as well stamp the word “unavailable” all over his perfectly proportioned little forehead. Yet somehow that only makes that forehead—and the rest of him—so much hotter. Instead of spending my nights navigating the awkward dating pool that is Harvard, I spend my nights stalking his Facebook page, and professing my love on ISawYouHarvard, hoping somehow, someday, he’ll see it and say it back.
Heed my warning: don’t let those smoldering eyes fool you and make you suffer what I’ve suffered. And to you, hot TF with the body of a Greek god and the face of an angel: you had me at hello, and it’s been making my life hell.

From his cushy red armchair in front of the fireplace in Winthrop’s Tonkens room, MIT professor Noam Chomsky answered questions on topics from the Middle East conflict to American politics last Tuesday. The established linguist also known for his controversial political views responded to questions regarding the United States’ place in a multipolar world, the relative dangers of radical Christianity and radical Islam, the latter resulting in a five-minute debate.
Chomsky’s talk, which saw about 70 attendees and followed a question-and-answer format, was the first in a series at Winthrop House organized by House Master Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and the House Senior Common Room. Although the first two lectures featured political figures—the second speaker was former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis—Sullivan said that he hopes to expand beyond political figures in the future and also bring in entertainment, sports, and business leaders. According to Sullivan, the series is intended to increase student involvement with the SCR. But ever the competitors, some  Winthropians saw it as more.
“I think it’s a great addition to House life,” Winthrop resident Jonathan M. Padilla ’12 said. “We’re definitely going to build this to compete with what Kirkland House does.”
Next-door-neighbor Kirkland, which has been hosting “Conversations with Kirkland” since 2002, doesn’t seem to be picking up whatever Winthrop just threw down. “Imitation is the highest form of flattery,” KirklandHouse Master Tom Conley said.
Peter V. Emerson, the Kirkland House Scholar who recruits guests for “Conversations with Kirkland,” agreed with Conley’s insistence on peace, saying that he was in favor of anything that enriches the student experience. “I think we all should be about you—about the students,” Emerson said.

Mankind has executed many an excellent con through its long history of thinking and using tools–tricking animals into domesticating, breaking the bank at Monte Carlo, wearing leggings as pants. We are generally a sneaky animal. But no con thus far has proven as egregious, successful, or difficult to expose as the one executed by the tourism board of Salem, Mass.
Many of you may be considering visiting Salem for Halloween. Go. By all means, do. Enjoy the craziness, the costumes, the revelry. It’s going to be awesome and inimitable, just like they told you it would. Take the ferry or the commuter rail, bring your sluttiest slutty witch costume, and party like it isn’t the 1690s.
And then never, ever go back there again.
Ever. The nefarious Tourism Board will try to dupe you into returning. You’ll remember all the dressed-up people, all the drinking you did, and you’ll think to yourself, “What a cool place Salem is.” But remember what you learned from last weekend’s hook-up: everything looks good in the dark wearing pancake makeup, but once you turn the light on things get a lot less cute. Salem is no different.
Because if you really think back, what was actually there to see? The House of Seven Gables? It’s a house. With gables. The Salem Maritime National Historic Site? It has a U.S. Customs House complex. Which is only famous because Nathaniel Hawthorne set the first chapter of “The Scarlet Letter” there, a chapter that is so agonizingly boring that most teachers don’t make you read it. The West India Goods Store? The Pickering House (The oldest house continually occupied by the same family!)? The New England Pirate Museum? Which is full of compasses and sashes (compasses and sashes!!).
Let’s not and say we did.
Or, if you are as unlucky in your friends and as unsuspecting in your dealings with tourist traps as myself, let’s get suckered into going and waste the commuter rail fare. Let’s walk around a bunch of old buildings we aren’t allowed to enter. Like touring the Newport Mansions, but without the mansions. And also without the touring. It will be the most funnest, right?
No it will not. This level of boring is and should be obviously atrocious. Even Salem itself isn’t trying to hide it. Just look at how they advertise the attractions in their town.
“A rich maritime heritage.”
“An impressive display of historic architecture.”
“A culturally diverse population.”
Two of these aren’t even tangible. One of these is also true of North Korea. And none of these is interesting. For all that they’ve been milking Massachusetts’s middle schools for field trip money all these years, Salem hasn’t been lying to us. Minus the positive connotation of words like “impressive” and “rich,” the above is an accurate description of what Salem has to offer. The tourism board is keeping it real.
So where in creation are we getting this idea that Salem is awesome? Who is feeding the lies machine? For a long time, I couldn’t figure out whose dark dealings had landed me in that 17th-century shantytown. Of course I’d seen Salem listed on the roster of important historical Massachusetts sights. But I’d also seen the Nantucket Whaling Museum, and I’d still been smart enough to stay away from the land of “Moby Dick” dioramas. The “rich maritime heritage” of kerosene and Captain Ahab hadn’t tricked me. So why had I decided that the “rich maritime heritage” of a shipping city was cool enough to make Salem worth a visit?
It was you people. You people and your Halloween trips to Salem, talking about how haunted the House of Seven Gables is and how much fun it was. You people with your tales of Wiccan temples and costumed crazies. You’re the source of the problem. So this year, when you go there for Halloween, have fun. Go crazy. Fall in love with Salem and become convinced it’s awesome all the time.
Just shut up about it afterwards.

More than a decade ago, I attended a summer camp in our neighboring county. The building, a church, crouched a few neighborhoods behind the highway, the exit marked by a certain series of trees that over the course of the summer grew mustaches and faces and a disapproving look that I think I would still recognize today.
The program was in some sense evangelical—I call it Bible camp. I’ve never been part of a more sordid organization. They screened terrifying films of the crucifixion that made a lasting and hardly spiritual impression on me. Order was questionably governed, the director being absent four days a week, and the children congealing into sophisticated power circles. The socially unfit had a hard time.
Still, it was a lovely, golden summer. There was a small courtyard overgrown with white clovers. The girls picked them from the ground and wreathed them into rings, asking delicately, “Which finger do you want this on?” Say you offered your middle finger, stuck it up like a beacon—the shrieks stayed in your head all day. Some days, we played Bingo, following the burps and rattles of the obese director like hushed parodies of senility.
There were two assistant counselors, J and D, twins whom I have never forgotten. They alone must have sustained the camp financially, because it lasted four years. No where else have I seen two people so universally loved by a group of anarchic kids. We were drawn to them as though to pipers, and lulled to that place people dream their memories could take them. The twins defined for me, in a complex and unfathomable way, what it meant to be good with children.
A day in the summer, the year of the cicadas.
At camp, I had adopted the critical project of properly burying all the dead cicadas in the weedy courtyard. On my own I gathered, with great delicacy, the eight or nine whole cicadas and placed them in a quiet corner, a nook far from where the other kids pestered roly polies.
Three of the cicadas were still alive. Two protested sluggishly against my handling of them. The last, I was shocked to see, was nearly fully alive. It could walk and fly short distances. Then, as if out of breath, it needed to rest.
I brought this last cicada to one of the twins, with the then-powerful conviction that those you love also love the things you love.
She identified it.
“O-oh. You’ve got a cicada.”
I transferred it to her hand. “It’s still alive. This is probably the last cicada you’ll see alive.”
I left her staring at her palm. When I returned to my cicada graveyard, I saw three other children—Stephanie, precocious six-year-old queen, Nate, the “big kid,” and Benjamin, the boy I thought I loved—crouched over the dead and still-living cicadas. They were doing something with sticks that I couldn’t see, and the closer I approached the more tightly they huddled.
When I realized what it was, I grew hysterical. “That is so wrong!” I screamed. “That is so wrong!”
At some point, I couldn’t hear them over my own voice, but I could see them laughing. As my screams grew louder, they laughed harder, but it looked to me like their mouths simply opened wider and wider.
The twins appeared next to me. One picked me up and bore me away, and I saw the other’s back and ponytail as she stood over Steph, Nate, and Ben to see what they were doing.
They were making kebobs.
I sobbed into a shoulder. “Those are the last cicadas you’ll ever see alive!”
As it happened, when the cicadas returned seven years later, they missed my town by four miles.
Good with children—I can do it for short periods of time. When I need to be, I think about J and D, and I try to act the way I remember them acting. When the children get stubborn, I am D, and when they are hysterical, I am J. But mostly I am a mixture of both, and when it works, I am calm and successful. I can do this for a little while, but I can’t do it forever.
How did they do it? I remember another crazy day—the kids were just rowdier than usual. D’s voice was hoarse from being so tired, the boys still wanting her to play dodgeball, and J was sprawled on the courtyard ground, buried by girls who wanted to put more things in her hair. They were tugging on her arms and legs like Lilliputians, and D was bending over laughing because J’s eyes were shut and her mouth hanging open as if she were dead and intending to stay that way. The next summer, after the camp finally closed down, I ran into them at the local Y, still trying to get jobs as camp counselors.
How did this all come to me? I saw them once, not many months ago. I am at the shopping mall, in a store I rarely go to anymore because the quality is terrible. But I am hunting for cheap sandals, and this is how I see them.
They seem not to have aged. They look thinner, but the face is unmistakable—long, with  wide-set eyes and gently sloping noses.
They are dressed strangely. I cannot take my eyes off what they are wearing. I see a short plaid skirt, a blazer that looks unbearably cheap, some wrinkled plastic apparition over a shirt of possibly white mesh. A leg lifts and rubs the back of a calf with a gaudy shoe. They are dressed like 12-year-old girls from 10 years ago. And now their hair is done in the same way—tied up tight at the back of their heads.
One turns to the other and says something, and then lifts her hand to brush her hair behind her ears—one floating, girlish motion that doesn’t end but goes back years and years.
I’d seen them intermittently in the in-between years. When I was 16, I greeted them and we had a short exchange in which neither side knew what to say. Still I could always tell, who was one, who was the other. After all, they were the reason why I became good at telling twins—since J and D, no twins have ever looked identical to me. I take five minutes, and then I can tell one from the other. A male friend of mine says, “There are two kinds of girls that I like. There are the sweet ones, and then there are the other kind—crunchy. Sweet, and crunchy.”
And that’s pretty much the best I can explain it, how it is for me and twins. There is always one who is more like J, one who is more like D.
A mind exercise: the body is a circle of peaks, and in the middle there is a bright lake. Those transient summers, J and D let us wander in this place, and we children streamed across the valley floor—swarming around the water’s edge, tumbling down the banks and howling to the moon, our hundred tongues lapping, summer after summer, the stuff one should not give away. We sapped a vital thing, golden drops rolling on our tongues, during a long summer we would remember piecemeal in a million years. And if we gave them something—if children ever gave them anything—it would be these reserves of memory in our most private minds, tempered and brilliant and warm. They share a summer with the cicadas; the air’s hot vibrato, the cicadas’ fat trundle, the twins, their long hair, cool fingers, clean smell. To me their names are sacred, and rich as the wood of a church pew.
All this to say that we were free from consequence, and they were not. As they leave the counter, I let my eyes follow them out of the store. My hair is short as a boy’s now, so I don’t think I am recognizable. But one of them—J?—is saying something to the other, and together they turn their heads to look at me. Already I am looking at my hands. Already I cannot tell them apart.
—Maria Y. Xia ’11, an English concentrator in  Mather House, is seeing double.

On Saturday afternoon, the Faneuil Hall pub Ned Divine’s was buzzing with the chatter of young couples returning from a quest for romance and adventure—but more importantly, a diamond.
That morning, couples scavenged Boston to accrue points towards winning a $20,000, 2.4 karat diamond ring. Receiving clues on their cell phones, contestants completed tasks ranging from math problems to creating a football formation with unknowing bystanders. This so-called “Diamond Dash” was sponsored by Long’s Jewelers, a Massachusetts jewelry store.
For some, the Dash presented an opportunity to fulfill an engagement dream hindered by monetary constraints. For others, like winners Allison and Michael Harvey, it was a way to make a quick buck on their scavenging skills and knowledge of Boston. Contestant Bob Saphirstein said he wished to please his girlfriend who “likes shiny things.”
The Harvey duo—who are actually brother and sister—said they knew they had the ring in the bag. “We were the first ones back to the after-party location and the only people confident about our high scores,” said Allison. As other couples discussed lower point totals, the Harveys grew confident with their total 97 out of 104 possible points, she said.
As the announcements began, the Harveys gripped each others’ hands and a team called “The Karat Couple” hugged and squeezed their eyes shut. The event organizers suspensefully dialed the phone number of the winning team.
Allison’s phone buzzed. She screeched and ran onstage while Michael, pumping his fists in the air, followed. The crowd, displeased with the unromantic conclusion to the dash, booed when they learned of the siblings’ relationship. Although Michael claimed onstage that he would give the ring to his girlfriend, it seems this was to save face.
“We will probably sell it and split the money,” said Allison. “But I’ll wear it for now.”

Lame Duck Books, age 6, is expected to pass away sometime in April 2011, after a longtime battle against financial hemorrhaging. The Cambridge native was born in September 2004 on 10 Arrow St. Since then, Lame Duck has devoted its life to providing a space for collectors to purchase and peruse rare books and manuscripts. Even in its final days, Lame Duck continues to pride itself on its array of poetry, rare literature, and history in a cornucopia of languages. In 2008, Lame Duck sold a first-edition copy of Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita” to a London-based bookseller for $50,000.
Pierre Menard Gallery, Lame Duck’s fraternal twin, is also likely to expire in the coming spring. In addition to providing the basement out of which Lame Duck operates, Pierre Menard has worked to display unique works of art to the public over the last six years. In 2008, Pierre Menard held a show displaying German artist Heide Hatry’s sculptures of human heads made entirely of real pigskin.
Lame Duck and Pierre Menard are survived by their father, John W. Wronoski. Initially, Wronoski had hoped to create a symbiosis between literature and art when he set up Lame Duck and Pierre Menard side by side. However, he soon found that few people were interested in merchandise, as it was common for entire days to pass without a single customer. “It proved that showing art in Cambridge didn’t have any commercial potential at all,” he said.
“I had to figure out a way to staunch the bleeding,” said Wronoski, of his plan to say goodbye to Lame Duck and Pierre Menard. Wronoski has no desire to resurrect his two children in another location.

The Leverett House ’80s Dance entered this world 10 years after the themed dance’s namesake decade ended. Now, as the time lapse hits the 20-year mark, the event has been confronted with a midlife crisis.
What is best imagined as a mega-church for those who worship sparkles, spandex, and Cher has become a financial sore spot for the Lev HoCo. The $5 pre-purchased and $7 at-the-door tickets for the ’80s Dance used to rake in capital for the House, but attendance has dwindled in past years. So, in the name of profit, Lev’s HoCo has tabled the dance.
Though newcomers to the House have no qualms about the postponement or the prospects of cancellation, a few seniors on HoCo expressed nostalgia for the theme, according to HoCo Social Chair Olga Tkachenko ’12.
When else will the members of HoCo congregate in bright pink spandex shorts? When will hundreds of students, male and female alike, gather to belt out the lyrics to “ Girls Just Want To Have Fun?”
But cold hard finance has won over HoCo, and in the ’80s Dance’s place, Lev hosted the Blackout party on Saturday night. Tkachenko said that Lev HoCo thought the new theme would bring more revelers.
But if the ’80s are your theme of preference, don’t fret.
“We’re hoping to revamp the ’80s and bring it back,” Tkachenko said.
With a revised playlist, better advertising, and maybe more sparkles, the ’80s Dance just may be making a comeback in the near future.

The deadline had come and gone, and Michael’s final expository writing paper remained unfinished. Despite his best efforts, he couldn’t bring a sense of organization to his sentences and paragraphs. The preceptor recommended that he turn in whatever he had or face a failing grade on the paper.
“My teacher literally sent me an e-mail saying you should turn in your paper right now so you can pass the class,” says Michael, who requested his real name not be used for this article.
Instead Michael ignored the warning and took another two days to work on the paper. But the preceptor’s warning stood, and he had to retake Expos.
Now a junior, Michael has become an English concentrator who consistently gets A’s on his papers.
“Asperger’s people just process the world a little differently,” Michael says, referring to his neurological disorder. “It never occurred to me that I could possibly fail that.”
Knowledge does not come a priori. It must be consumed and built up—a book must be read, a lecture heard, or a topic debated. For some Harvard undergraduates that task comes with added obstacles, whether it’s attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, or dyslexia.
A new student arrives at the FAS Accessible Education Office nearly every workday to report a disorder, according to Sheila B. Petruccelli, the office’s interim director.
Many of those students will seek official recognition from the office to receive what are referred to as “accommodations,” a category that includes additional time on exams or peer note-takers.
“[T]he office is currently providing services to approximately 250 students, if we exclude students with physical disabilities, including vision and hearing impairments,” wrote Jeff A. Neal, college spokesman.
The Office is charged with a weighty responsibility: advancing the College’s stated mission “to create knowledge” in all students, disabled or otherwise, while making sure that accommodations are not taken unfair advantage of and maintaining the integrity of academic standards. Undergraduates who receive accommodations are not without complaints, but they do recognize the challenge in meeting both goals day-to-day, case-by-case.
And in this case, Michael has Asperger’s, a neurological condition that he says contributes to both his disorganization and his perfectionism. After failing the paper, he began what can be an arduous process: proving to the College that he had Asperger’s and needed accommodations. There were a number of steps, one of which was an all-day study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Michael is not alone in his decision to turn to the AEO after a particularly tumultuous freshman fall. The Office mails information to every newly-admitted freshman and informs him or her of the availability of accommodations. Despite their outreach, every year it takes a tough semester to push some freshmen to consider that something else might be going on.
“Freshman year is a difficult year for probably everybody to some extent,” Petruccelli says.
Of course, a difficult semester alone does not qualify a student for an accommodation from the AEO. Students must submit their past diagnoses to the Office, which are reviewed by a professional neuropsychologist. The students are also asked to indicate their anticipated needs so that the neuropsychologist can evaluate those requests.
“The accommodations are there to level the playing field,” says Petruccelli. “It doesn’t give an unfair advantage.”
ADMISSIONS
Mary, a senior, never suspected that her brain worked any differently from her those of her peers while growing up, even though a single test could take several class periods to complete. Mary, who asked that her real name not be used, assumed that she just took longer than others to focus and complete academic work. She still managed to be at the top of her class four years running, according to Mary. Her mother had suspected that she had severe ADHD since Mary was 3 or 4 years old, Mary says. However, her mother was wary of having Mary diagnosed because of the stigma their small, conservative town placed on medicated children with ADHD.
“They were considered the bad students, the out-of-control students, even by teachers,” Mary recalls. “[My mom] was worried that if I had extra time or accommodations that my academic status in the school would be delegitimized.”
However, because Mary was only able to finish roughly 60 percent of her standardized ACT and SAT exams, Mary’s mother encouraged her daughter to get diagnosed her senior year of high school. It was then that Mary also began taking Adderall. Mary says that when she applied to Harvard, she acknowledged that she received extended time on standardized tests.
Undergraduates are not required or prohibited from identifying that they have a disability or disorder that might affect their time at Harvard when applying to the College.
“For some, the disclosure of a disability in, say, a college essay, may make sense,” says James H. Wendorf, executive director for the National Center for Learning Disabilities. “They want to talk about the steps they’ve taken to overcome that challenge...to develop compensatory skills that may be of special interest to the College.” But others may not want their learning disability taken into account when they are evaluated for admission.
“It’s a very personal decision,” he says.
Harvard has become more open to admitting students who, despite their demonstrated thirst for knowledge, struggle to learn.
“Fifty years ago, students who were dyslexic were just considered stupid, and they could rarely have the opportunity to benefit from higher learning,” writes Howard E. Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at the Graduate School of Education, in an e-mail to The Crimson. During his five decades at Harvard, Gardner, who studies the nature of intelligence, has seen the University become a place that better understands the nuances of the challenges that some of its students face.
“I can say that some students with learning difficulties have performed brilliantly, and others have suffered and should never have been admitted, at least given our current state of knowledge and the intellectual prostheses at our disposal,” Gardner writes. “Perhaps some day that will change.”
THE FIRST YEAR
Mary first started using academic testing accommodations for her then recently-diagnosed ADHD when she began freshman year at Harvard. After its evaluation, the AEO initially granted Mary time and a quarter on exams, even though she says that most students receive time and a half. She quickly discovered that even with the added time, she still couldn’t finish any exam at Harvard.
“I have to turn in a test with two blank pages on the end, and I’ve worked so hard on writing everything down and I’ve studied so hard,” Mary says. “I’m just reading the questions and writing as fast as I can, the same stuff as anyone else would.”
For Dylan, a junior in Eliot House, freshman year was a difficult transition. Dylan has dyspraxia, a disorder that affects motor skill development and consequently his ability to organize, manage time, and communicate. Dylan, who requested his real name not be used, underwent testing in September of his freshman year, but after months of waiting he still had not heard back from the AEO.
“I presumed that because I didn’t hear anything back, there wasn’t results to be had from it, other than you’re not qualified,” he says.
Dylan survived his first fall semester without any testing accommodations, though he occasionally was unable to complete tests in time. In April of his freshman spring, Dylan went to the AEO to check on the status of his evaluation. He was surprised to discover that he had long been qualified for time and a half on exams, but that the AEO had not contacted him to inform him of the results, he said. Dylan, however, believes that he was an atypical case.
“I think it was a one-time mistake from the accessibility office and they did apologize profusely,” he says. “I didn’t think it was something worth pushing because I was satisfied with my full exam results. I had only missed out on one semester. I was relieved that I did qualify because it was what I was used to.”
But there are instances of open disagreement between students and the AEO. Jack, a junior who asked that his real name not be used, was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in elementary school. Since then, he has received time and a half and the use of a word processor on tests and exams—another accommodation available through the AEO. Jack notes that his high school was very flexible, and he became dependent on extended testing time. Immediately after arriving on campus, the AEO contacted Jack to discuss obtaining extended testing time in college. At first, Jack faced skepticism from the AEO because his clinical test results were considered to be old and outdated. According to Petruccelli, the AEO requires up-to-date tests to ensure that the evaluation reflects the current abilities of a student.
“We need to know how you’re functioning today,” she says.
Jack says the AEO provided him with extended time on his exams only after “a grudging conversation,” with the warning that his accommodations would be removed the next semester if he did not undergo another round of updated testing.
“I was very frustrated with them at the time because I have this complete record of the past 10 years of my life where I have had consistently these problems and this data,” he says. “And they were like, ‘Well, by our metric you might have gotten better, so we’re not going to trust these numbers until you get an updated test.’”
Despite his initially negative perception of the AEO, Jack says that he understands why it has to treat incoming cases with a critical eye.
“I think it’s not easy to be an office that provides testing accommodations at statistically the smartest school in America because there’s going to be skepticism because people will be like, ‘These kids got into Harvard, why do they need academic accommodations?’” he says. “So necessarily the process for qualifying students is rigorous.”
Though Jack was used to time and a half on exams in high school, the AEO only granted him time and a quarter. According to Jack, this has proven to be more than adequate,
AN ACCESSIBLE OFFICE
The AEO sits halfway between the Quad and the Yard, tucked inside the Registrar’s office. It is here that students come to talk about their struggles, accommodations, and sometimes the Red Sox.
“Part of being useful to a student is knowing who that student really is,” says Petruccelli.
But her office is all about business. Books on learning disabilities populate her office shelves; she’s currently reading “Hamlet’s Philosophy: A Practical Guide for Building a Good Life in the Digital Age.” From her chair positioned behind her desk, Petruccelli faces a painting drawn by her nephew: a red sky above black mountains, with green grass below. It’s simple but pleasant.
“Everybody in the family made a great deal of fun of him,” she says, but ever the supportive aunt, Petruccelli proudly hangs it on the wall. “You shouldn’t squelch his creativity,” she recalls telling family members.
Sitting in her chair, wearing wide-rectangular glasses, and a blue turtleneck, Petruccelli frames the role she plays in undergraduates’ lives while FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal sits in on the interview.
It was to this office that Mary returned when she realized that her initial testing accommodation was not enough. She had not been able to complete a single test since freshman year, but it took until junior year to find the confidence to make an appeal to the AEO, Mary says.
“I may be a perfectionist, but I think that I understand how to control that tendency when I’m working on my test,” she says, “I think [my case] was pretty apparent and convincing.”
As a result of her efforts, the AEO temporarily granted her time and a half, even though they did not give Mary an official professional evaluation before extending her testing accommodations, she says. That year marked the first time in her three years at Harvard that she finished an entire exam. It was her Social Analysis 10 final, and she handed it in more than an hour after hundreds of peers had emptied the room.
“I found after my time here at Harvard, that they really do want to give you what you need,” Mary says. “They just want to make sure it’s appropriate.”
A DEADLINE DEFERRED
Mary’s academic struggles with her learning disability were not limited to exams—she also struggled to meet deadlines for papers.
“The real killer on my GPA freshman year, sophomore year too, was that I turned in at least 80 percent of my papers late,” she says. “I was having a really hard time managing papers where I would end up with three in a weekend.”
For the paper-writing courses, Mary says that she would not even hand her official letters from the AEO asking professors to grant students accommodations for their learning disabilities.
“There’s nothing in my accommodations letter from sophomore year that says anything about my ADHD affecting papers. And they’ll think, well it’s just an excuse anyway,” Mary says. “Yet the same problem that was affecting me on tests was affecting me on my papers.”
Mary brought the problem up to the AEO, who explained that they could not require that professors grant her extensions on papers as they did on exams. However, the AEO could make a note at the bottom of her accommodations letters explaining that, despite her best efforts, Mary could still have trouble meeting standard deadlines.
“More than anything else, professors are very understanding about giving extensions here,” Mary says. “I don’t think I would even have needed the letter. I just needed the letter to give me the confidence to ask.”
Mary points out, however, that she does not ask for an extension on every paper. Under normal circumstances, she will attempt to start her papers earlier and turn them in on time. In situations where she has multiple papers due on the same or consecutive days, she will ask for and usually be granted an extension of one or two days.
Jack also acknowledges that he likely takes longer than the average Harvard student to complete a writing assignment, but he did not ask the AEO to request paper extensions in his accommodations letter.
“For these materials I can work on ahead of time,” he says. “I don’t even think that it’d even be fair for me to get extended time because I’ve managed quite adequately with the circumstances.”
Michael, the junior English concentrator, says he occasionally requests extended paper deadlines—sometimes eliciting jealousy from his roommates.
“Some of my roommates kind of sneer and think I’m working the system because I’m getting an extra couple days,” he says. He adds in his defense, “What’s the point of writing a paper if I’m going to do a shitty job?”
For example, while his roommate rushed to finish a paper by the 5 p.m. deadline in a class they took together, Michael was able to rest easily knowing that he had more time to complete the essay.
“If they screw around and wait to do something at the last minute, it’s a situation,” he says. “With me, I may have been working that whole week on a particular paper.”
Michael says he spends days thinking about an essay’s structure and then puts pen to paper and sketches a rough—if sometimes chaotically disorganized—outline, typically filled with notes in the margins. In order to get going in the first place, he must have a clear desk and the right amount of focus.
“I just can’t sit down and [say] now is the time that I’m going to work,” says Michael.
ABUSING THE SYSTEM
According to the students interviewed, the general Harvard population is accepting of their disabilities and disorders, and these students are open about their conditions to their close friends. At the same time, some believe that some students do use learning disabilities, real or feigned, just for the perceived perks. Mary, for example, acknowledges that there are students who abuse ADHD medication for the artificially heightened focus.
“I think it makes it harder for students that are actually diagnosed because people see their diagnoses as less legitimate,” she says. “There are so many people trying to get the drugs to do stuff faster and easier.”
However, undergraduates who have been through the process say they believe that the AEO creates a sufficient barrier to prevent students from abusing the accommodation system.
“At the end of the day, that system is there in place to help people that do need it. And most people that do abuse it, I don’t know how much advantage they get over their peers.” says Dylan.
“I don’t think anybody tries to make life easier here. I think everybody says, ‘How can we make this more accessible to a student?’ That’s what our obligation is,” Petruccelli says of her office’s goal.
But every such statement is also counterbalanced by one about the rigors of the process. “The expert really looks at a wide range of assessments to determine if it really is a disability,” she says.
Moreover, there are strict limits to what types of accommodations are allowed. Curricular requirements apply to all students, regardless of their disability or disorder. One sticking point is the foreign language requirement, which can prove to be difficult for some students.
“I learn much more visually than other people do. Language classes are much more verbal,” Michael says. “Asperger’s people aren’t verbal learners.”
The National Center for Learning Disabilities encourages language requirement exemptions if an undergraduate’s disability or disorder has significant effects on his or her ability to learn languages, according to Wendorf.
“We strongly believe there should be a responsible allowance for exceptions particularly in the foreign language requirement,” he says. “American sign language is an alternative that a number of students with language-based learning disabilities choose.”
But Harvard does not offer that alternative. Petruccelli argues that Harvard has a responsibility to prepare all of its students for life after college. For example, if a student attends the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for a graduate degree in English, they are required to demonstrate a reading knowledge in at least two languages.
“What do we do when that student cannot get a Ph.D. without that knowledge?” she says.
‘THE SAME DEGREE’
Jack says that he hopes one day he will no longer depend on the accommodations. Years of developing organizational and coping strategies for his disorder have made its symptoms much more manageable. Midway through his freshman year of college, Jack stopped taking his ADHD medication and has been off it since. Being able to function off medication marks a personal victory for him.
“It’s not a good thing to be dependent on medication. There are side effects. You get to feel like it’s sort of a crutch,” he says. “Much like how these accommodations are a crutch.”
Jack admits that while off medication, he is noticeably more nervous and manic, and he finds it harder to concentrate naturally.
“It takes more work now, but I can achieve the same level of focus. With medication, it’s almost pushed on me,” he says.
According to Jack, one major reason he is slowly weaning himself from testing accommodations and medication is his desire to better prepare himself for a time when such accommodations will no longer be available.
“If your boss says, ‘Well, you need to have this on my desk by Wednesday,’ you don’t say, ‘Well, I have a learning disability, so you need to give me more time,’” he says. “It’s sort of a question of adapting to the reality and that’s what I hope to do.”
Meanwhile, Petruccelli says the College has no intention of encouraging students to reduce their accommodations.
“We don’t think of these as a sign that somebody is less than anybody else,” says Petruccelli. “If somebody uses a wheel chair, we don’t think that if they just try hard enough, they eventually won’t need the wheel chair anymore.”
Ultimately, the AEO and students both agree that accommodations exist to ensure that all students can obtain the knowledge that a Harvard degree symbolizes.
“We are very clear to students that when they earn a Harvard degree, they’re getting the same degree that everybody else gets,” says Petruccelli.
“In many ways, I don’t see myself as extremely disabled or disadvantaged,” says Dylan. “At Harvard, I feel like I am on the same level playing field as everyone else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
William H. Walsh, a former Cambridge City Council member and influential local figure in the 1980s, died suddenly in his home in Maine on Oct. 15. He was 65.
During a time when rent control was a prominent issue in local government politics, Walsh—described by local pundit Robert Winters as the “janitor’s son who grew up on Hurlbut Street”—was elected to the Council in 1985 and served until he was convicted of 41 counts of bank fraud and sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1994.
His law firm, Ferraro and Walsh, was a prominent force in the midst of Cambridge’s frenzied real estate market in the mid-1980s. As an outspoken opponent of the rent control laws that governed Cambridge at the time, Walsh made a slew of both friends and enemies whose opinions of him shifted depending on the profitability of their real estate investments, according to Winters, who bought real estate from Walsh.
Sheila T. Russell, a former mayor of Cambridge who was elected to the Council in the same year as Walsh, remembers his “strong presence” in City Hall and his pranks as a practical joker.
In 1991, when the Cambridge City Councillors were told that a Christmas tree would not be permitted in City Hall because it was “connotative of Christian beliefs,” Walsh and other sought the biggest tree in the lot and placed it on the first floor the building.
Walsh and company placed flags from every country in the world on the tree so that no one would object to its presence in City Hall.
Instead of a Christmas tree, this was a “Tree for the Holiday Season,” Russell said.
“He was a very bright guy, very intelligent,” said James J. Rafferty, an attorney in Cambridge who served on the Cambridge School Committee when Walsh was a city councillor. “He did have a certain charm to him; he had a very welcoming attitude; he loved being around people.”
One of the most memorable moments for both Russell and Rafferty took place in 1995, when Walsh responded to a complaint of an art exhibit that contained “obscene” images.
Taking matters into his own hands, Walsh destroyed the art exhibit, which, according to The Crimson, contained “anatomically explicit dildos,” and was later found not guilty to charges of malicious destruction of personal property.
“He had friends from all walks of life,” Rafferty said. “He had a great passion for people. [He was] a man of great faith.”
A bachelor into his late 50s, according to Rafferty, Walsh is survived by his wife Mary, whom he met after hiring her to take care of his mother before she died.
“There wasn’t a more devoted son,” Rafferty said. “It’s one less person who really cared about other people.”

Whether hankering for gourmet brunch, or just flush with extra laundry money, students and Harvard ID holders can now use Crimson Cash to pay for meals at Henrietta’s Table restaurant at the Charles Hotel.
Adding variety to the long list of Harvard Square establishments already accepting Crimson Cash, Henrietta’s Table specializes in “fresh from the farm and honest-to-goodness New England cooking,” according to the restaurant’s website.
Alex Attia, general manager of the Charles Hotel, said he is excited about the expansion of payment options to include Crimson Cash.
“We’re very happy to have this service available to students,” Attia said.  “A meal at Henrietta’s Table is a great way to make students feel like they are at home, and Crimson Cash helps bring the two together.”
Offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Henrietta’s Table is probably best known for its weekend brunch buffets, particularly popular with visiting parents.
The restaurant may appeal to those looking to support local farmers with their dining choices—Chef Peter Davis favors products grown using sustainable agriculture, and eschews ingredients that have been genetically modified or engineered.  He also offers a list of the local farms whose produce he uses on the Henrietta’s Table website.
Although the ability to pay with Crimson Cash is useful for many students, some say it would only marginally affect their dining habits, generally preferring to pay with cash or debit cards instead.
“I never use Crimson Cash for anything besides laundry and printing,” Collin A. Rees ’12 said.

In the middle of the week, in the middle of the day, in the middle of Harvard Yard, a small group of elderly men and women gathered by the John Harvard statue to begin their weekly Harvard-Cambridge Walk for Peace.
Making their way through the Yard, they held high signs describing hopes and wishes for the war in Afghanistan to finally come to an end.
“The University aids us to be interested [in the war], to take part in counter measures which is what us geezers are doing here today,” said Kenneth Matthews, one of the walkers.
The idea of a peace walk began with three Cambridge women, two of whom still participate in the walks today, who held a vigil at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on September 20, 2001.
“We had a bad feeling about how the Bush administration was going to react towards 9/11,” said Jane Collins, one of the original walkers.
Though Collins said that the founders continued to feel concern, in the years following they decreased their activity until the arrival of Steven B. Bloomfield, Executive Director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, who began Harvard-Cambridge Walk for Peace in May 2004.
“After the revelations of the prisoner abuse and torture that took place at the Abu Ghraib prison, I thought it was essential that people at Harvard react to what was begin perpetrated in the name of US citizens,” Bloomfield said.
Bloomfield reached out to the community and the walks have continued for the last six years—even without his involvement. Bloomfield said he ended his involvement when President Barack Obama was elected in order to provide the new president a chance to prove his commitment to peace in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But these self-proclaimed “geezers” continue to show their dedication to the cause of peace. According to the group, the same five or six people repeatedly gather to make the walk every Wednesday afternoon in the middle of the Yard, remaining true to Bloomfield’s idea of meeting in the middle.
“I thought it would symbolize the centrality of the issue to our lives and the kind of meaning we should invest in it,” Bloomfield explained.
The walkers have received a range of attention, from being ignored to positive reinforcement. However, at the end of every walk, they wonder where the students are.
After all, if the war goes on, more young people are going to be needed to fight it, Matthews said.
All the members of the group who walked yesterday added that they want to see students engage with them, to join and demonstrate with them, and to remember the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“A lot of what we are trying to do is just remind people that people are still fighting and dying and killing, and something is still going on,” Collins said. “It does not  make any more sense than it did when [George] W. [Bush] started these wars.”

A panel of three Middle Eastern CEOs discussed the opportunities and challenges of doing business in the Middle East at the Kennedy School last night before dozens of entrepreneurs from the Arab world as part of a week-long AllWorld Summit.
The conference organizer, AllWorld Network, chose delegates, whom it considered some of the most promising entrepreneurs from their respective nations. AllWorld Network, which was co-founded by University Professor Michael E. Porter, is a non profit that aims to promote growth in economically developing areas.
At the event, entitled “Expanding the Global Economy: The High-Intensity Entrepreneur,” AllWorld co-founder Anne S. Habiby announced the development of the “Arabia Fast Growth 500,” a new list of fast-growing entrepreneurs in the Middle East that she said will influence regional governments to further accommodate commerce.
Habiby discussed the ability of such lists to be a “force for social and economic change” and told the story of a woman who received a standing ovation after winning the top slot in the Saudi 100, a surprise considering the prevailing attitude toward women in that country.
Delegates from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, South Africa, India, and Pakistan attended the panel and cheered for their countries as they were called off by Habiby.
The delegates also recounted tales of a fast-paced and cutthroat scavenger hunt that they participated in yesterday before the panel.
Panel member Dr. Amin Amin said that the Middle East is the “right place at the right time” for business right now, and that typically restrictive governments are beginning to understand that they need to open accessibility to everyone in the private sector.
Panelist Najat Rizk, who runs a Lebanese film and television production company, spoke of the challenges that entrepreneurs face in the Middle East, but also of the vast potential for innovation.
“We have to be creative in our management, in our strategy, in our production, in our marketing,” Rizk said, since there is no real system of rules or policies in place in the region.
Finally, prominent Saudi Arabian technology executive Khalid Sulieman outlined the 10 largest drawbacks to conducting business in the Middle East, including deficiencies in intellectual property laws, labor resources, and the supremacy of political connections.
However, Sulieman said, much of the Middle East is a “virgin market” with huge growth potential.
“Come to Saudi Arabia, it’s a lot of fun,” Sulieman said.

Chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Sheila C. Bair explained why, in her view, the recently passed financial reform legislation was necessary in the wake of the financial crisis at the Institute of Politics last night.
Bair, who presided over the FDIC—a federal agency that guarantees U.S. bank deposits—during the height of the financial crisis, argued that the recently passed Dodd-Frank Act will reduce the risk of systemic failure in the financial markets by improving federal oversight and preventing banks from taking excessive risks.
One major factor that Bair cited as a cause of the financial meltdown was the doctrine of “too big to fail”—that policymakers would be obligated to bail out large financial institutions facing bankruptcy, which provided an implicit safety net that encouraged them to take on dangerous amounts of risk.
“In world of ‘too big to fail’, risk-taking is subsidized by the government. Systemically important companies take on too much risk because the gains are private while the losses are socialized,” said Bair, who began her five-year term as FDIC Chairwoman in 2006.
According to Bair, the Dodd-Frank Act will help solve this problem by streamlining bankruptcy resolution processes and thus quickly repaying creditors.
Additionally, the legislation, passed this July, will enforce more stringent bank capital requirements, provide more protection for consumers of financial products and services, and establish the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify and respond to future threats to the security of the U.S. financial system.
“Even as we continue to deal with the aftermath of the new crisis, we all know that there are new risks of the horizon,” Bair said, citing the possibility of rising interest rates as an example.
Bair also fielded audience members’ questions, which spanned topics ranging from subprime mortgages and other risky assets to to broader issues about the public’s perception of the FDIC.
While audience members also expressed concern over whether the reforms would be able to prevent future financial crises, Bair defended the effectiveness of the new legislation.
“Although change can be uncertain, the current status quo is an invitation to future disasters down the road. These reforms promise to usher in an era of greater stability and efficiency in our financial system,” she said.

Vacant since the closure of Quick Flix video rental last March, 8 Bow St. became home to Harvard Square’s newest store last Friday with the opening of Dekey Tibet Shop.
According to owner Tsering Dickey, the shop has been in the works since July.  Although she is still in the process of receiving and organizing merchandise, the store is now officially open for business.
A native of Tibet, Dickey has lived in Boston for over 15 years but has never owned or opened a store before.
“I don’t have any experience,” she said.  “My husband has been helping me a lot.”
Decorated with colorful flags and proverbs, Dekey Tibet Shop offers a wide variety of silver and turquoise jewelry from India, as well as hand-sewn bags, hats, scarves, and sweaters from India and Nepal.
Dickey said the store has already received a lot of interest from students, who are particularly attracted to the warm winter hats and scarves decorated with patterns and animals.
While much of the merchandise is hand-made, the store also offers certain less expensive manufactured items—such as Tibet t-shirts.
Joining the ranks of other Tibetan-themed stores already in the Square, Dickey says she is friendly with her competitors. “We know each other,” she added.
Tsering Topgyal, co-owner of Tibet’s Jinten at 1174 Mass. Ave., echoed this feeling of camaraderie amongst the owners, and said he was glad to see another Tibet shop open; he even hopes to serve as a mentor for the newcomer.
“It is great to have each other,” he said.  “We can help each other out—with shipments and finding new merchandise.”

Two Harvard alumni—David B. Mumford ’57 and Susan L. Lindquist—were announced as recipients of the National Medal of Science, the nation’s highest scientific honor, in a press release issued by the White House last week.
The award, presented annually to 10 recipients, is given to individuals “deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical, biological, mathematical, or engineering sciences,” according to National Science Foundation website.
Mumford, currently an emeritus professor of mathematics at Brown University, was recognized for his “extraordinary contributions to the mathematical, engineering and neurobiological sciences,” according to an NSF press release.
Mumford studied mathematics at Harvard College and graduated magna cum laude in 1957. He continued graduate work in algebraic geometry and joined the Department of Mathematics as a faculty member 10 years later, garnering honors that include the Fields Medal and the MacArthur “Genius” Grant.
Mumford said his experiences at Harvard helped fuel a passion for mathematics, citing his doctorate adviser Oscar Zariski, a 1965 recipient of the medal, and the late Benoit B. Mandelbrot, whose lecture series he attended, as key influences.
“He was absolutely a giant in the field of algebraic geometry,” said Joseph D. Harris ’72, who was a student at the time Harris taught, and is currently a professor of mathematics. “I don’t think there’s anyone comparable in the position was in today. He left the subject very different from when he entered it.”
Harris’s colleagues agreed with this description, and said that Mumford played a large role in the development of his field.
“[Mumford] has made major contributions to algebraic geometry. He helped develop the field in the sixties, and his contributions—which are very far reaching—influence mathematics up to now,” said Shing-Tung Yau, chair of the department of mathematics. “We are very proud of him.”
Susan Lindquist, a professor of biology at MIT and member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, was recognized for her contributions to the field of protein folding.
“The award represents lifelong, outstanding contribution to science and leadership in the scientific community, and Susan has made both,” said Nobel laureate Phillip A. Sharp, an Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the board of directors at the Whitehead.
Lindquist, who received her doctorate from Harvard in 1977, has provided fundamental insight to how biological systems respond to stress, Sharp said. He added that the implications of her work are far reaching, extending from disease therapeutics to nanotechnology, according to Sharp.
Sharp added that Lindquist, in addition to scientific aptitude, has also demonstrated exceptional leadership.
“We turn to her for advice on numerous fronts,” Sharp said. “She also serves on boards across the country and has taken leadership in the national science scene.”
Past recipients of the award include James D. Watson, Linus C. Pauling, and B.F. Skinner.

Promoting his recently-published book, Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer spoke to over 150 undergraduates, law students, and other graduate students about his judicial philosophy and the history of the Supreme Court last night at the Center for Government and International Studies.
Breyer said he wrote his book “Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge’s View,” published last month, to educate the public about life as a justice, the mechanics of the Supreme Court, and his interpretation of the Constitution.
The book revolves around the question of why the American people accept the judgement of the Supreme Court—an institution he called a panel of “obscure bureaucrats that don’t have the power of the purse or the power of the sword.”
In his remarks, Breyer, who graduated from the Law School in 1964, reflected on why some Court rulings are not respected by the legislative and the executive branches of government, while other controversial cases, such as Brown v. Board of Education, are unquestionably accepted by the government and the country as a whole.
A former professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School, Breyer also articulated his philosophy as a jurist.
He said he strives to approach each case with “prudence and pragmatism.”
Breyer told the crowd that because the country faces unforeseeable, unique issues in the future, the Constitution should be interpreted as a living document with the ability to change over time.
Neil K. Chatani, a third year student at HLS, said he thought Breyer’s case for his political philosophy was convincing.
Chatani said he saw Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia speak at the Law School last year. Scalia is known for asserting that the Constitution should be interpreted exactly as it was intended when it was ratified in 1789, but this philosophy is rejected by Breyer.
“People think Scalia’s [judicial philosophy] is the most coherent, but Justice Breyer did a lot to convince me of his position,” Chatani said.
Erin K. Earl, a second year student at HLS, said that as a student just discovering and learning about these age-old cases, she found it helpful to hear the opinion of a veteran jurist.
Breyer emphasized that although every Supreme Court justice strives to vote on a case based on its merits, the Court is “made up by people,” he said.
“People are not angels, and so you’re going to have wrong decisions.”

The Allston Civic Association voted against a proposal by Stone Hearth Pizza Co., a local family-style restaurant chain, to occupy a Harvard-owned property at 182 Western Ave. last night.
The 8-6 vote hinged on residents’ concerns regarding Stone Hearth’s plan to request a beer and wine license.
Residents opposed to Stone Hearth’s intention to serve beer and wine said there was no need for a family restaurant to serve alcohol.
“I don’t support this,” said Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alfred. “I don’t think Allston needs another beer and wine license.”
Alfred said that because Stone Hearth would be located in a residential neighborhood, alcohol consumption would be problematic.
The ACA’s vote will be taken into consideration when the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the City of Boston Licensing Board review Stone Hearth’s proposal to renovate the site and grant the business permits.  But some residents said they were not concerned about Stone Hearth’s plan to request a beer and wine license.
“Personally, I like to drink wine with my meals,” said Brighton resident Lorraine C. Bossi. “I support this measure.”
In leasing the former Citgo station site to Stone Hearth, the University is maintaining its goal of making Allston, specifically Western Avenue a more lively environment, according to Senior Director of Community Relations Kevin A. McCluskey ’76. Since the halt on construction on the Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009, Harvard has focused on leasing its unoccupied properties in Allston.
“We are very pleased to welcome a great local family restaurant like Stone Hearth to Barry’s Corner and are hopeful that all the necessary approvals are achieved so Stone Hearth can open in Allston in the near future,” wrote University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp in an e-mailed statement. “Stone Hearth has a well-deserved reputation for excellence, will serve the community well, and brings a vibrant new use to Western Ave.”
Stone Hearth Pizza Co., an award winning family-owned business, focuses on local, organic, and sustainable food service.
“We’re not a late night destination, we’re not a bar scene,” said Stone Hearth’s Co-Owner Jonathan Schwarz in an interview earlier this week. “We focus on very simple but high quality food.”
Schwarz said that he and his partner Christopher Robbins went into the restaurant business together five years ago after years of working in corporate America. They wanted to open a restaurant that was “a little bit hip, warm, and inviting” and that would appeal to families by offering a menu that both children and parents could enjoy, Schwarz said.
Stone Hearth has three locations in the Greater Boston area—in the towns of Belmont, Needham, and Cambridge.
Their vision for the Allston restaurant is much like the current design of the Belmont location, according to Schwarz.
The Belmont restaurant is decorated in earthy hues, deep reds, and bright yellows. Pizza is made in an open stone hearth, and Schwarz says that on weekend nights children gather by the oven, delighted to see their dinner made before their eyes.
Over the past 12 months, the University has leased its property in Allston to seven business and non-profit organizations—including Genzyme, the Silk Road Project, and the Boston Boxing Club.

Harvard University has continued to suffer losses on exotic financial instruments even as economic growth has slowly resumed, according to a recently released University financial report.
For the year ending June 30, 2010, the University lost $214 million through investments in derivatives, but those losses are significantly lower than the previous year when the University’s derivative portfolio lost $2.5 billion.
The University has also maintained investments in credit default swaps—originally designed as a form of insurance against loan defaults but often used to make a bet on the likelihood of default—that incurred a $73 million loss on paper in 2010. In 2009, paper losses on credit default swaps reached $452 million, according to the University’s financial report for fiscal year 2010.
Money managers have, however, significantly decreased Harvard’s exposure to the asset class.
To strengthen oversight over the University’s investments in derivatives, which have been cited as a cause for the breadth of the financial crisis, money managers have put in place tighter accounting standards for derivatives that seek to decrease risk associated with the investments.
To increase liquidity in the portfolio, money managers have also increased the University’s holdings of cash and U.S. Treasuries from $300 million in 2009 to $1 billion in 2010, according to the report. They added that they expected to increase the University’s liquid holdings for fiscal year 2011.
In previous years, the University’s operating funds were invested alongside the endowment, which resulted in a scramble for cash in the midst of the financial crisis.
In looking to the University’s future, the report sounded a note of caution, warning that investment returns are likely to remain “modest in comparison to the extraordinary returns” prior to 2009, that income from tuition is unlikely to increase given the University’s financial aid commitments, and that research funding from the federal government may decrease given the looming national debt.
The report also indicates that University money managers continue to contend with servicing debt payments after Harvard borrowed $480 million on the bond markets to meet cash obligations in 2009.
From fiscal year 2009 to 2010, the University’s debt load has increased by $300 million to $6.3 billion, with interest payments totaling $265 million. In 2009, interest payments reached $210 million.
To increase its fiscal flexibility, the University has placed an emphasis on “current use giving,” donations that can be directed toward any aspect of the budget. But, according to the report, those gifts decreased from between 2009 and 2010, dropping 15 percent from $291 million to $248 million.
Funding from the federal government, however, remained strong in 2010 and increased 15 percent in large part as a result of grants awarded to Harvard researchers as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. However, given political pressure to cut government spending, professors and administrators have expressed fears that funding from the federal government may decrease in the future.

The weekly farmers’ market in front of the Science Center is a habit that K J Warren ’11 and Lindsey M. Kowal ’12 developed over the past semester.
“It’s a tradition to look forward to in the middle of the week,” Warren says.
Both the Farmers’ Market at Harvard and its sister market in Allston began as projects of the Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ Food Literacy Project, and are dedicated to selling locally grown or made products such as baked goods, cheese, or maple syrup, with the goal of making healthier and fresher products more accessible to the Harvard community while supporting local vendors.
While the Farmers’ Market at Harvard has largely been successful in satisfying such a mission, its younger sibling—the Allston Farmers’ Market—is still struggling.
GOING GREEN, GOING SMALL?
The Farmers’ Market at Harvard—opened in 2005—and the Allston Farmers’ Market—opened in 2008—both have operated under the mission of supporting local farms. While normally about 17 cents of every dollar spent goes to the farmer, all of the money spent at a farmer’s market goes directly to the farmer, according to HUHDS.
Food Literacy Project coordinator Dara B. Olmsted ’00, manager of the farmer’s markets in front of the Science Center and in Allston, says that the main contribution of the farmer’s market was its emphasis on going local.
“[The farmer’s market] brings people together—supporting local farms and local community is important to a lot of people,” she says.
And the concept of a farmer’s market is not only to make healthy food more accessible to a local community, but also to bolster local business in an environmentally friendly way, according to Walter C. Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“[Farmer’s markets] can support local agriculture with shorter supply chains, and lessen environmental impact as well,” he says.
Nearly all of the 24 vendors at the Harvard market are local. The Harvard market’s counterpart in Allston, located in a parking lot across the street from a Whole Foods, has only nine.
But according to Olmsted, the Allston market—which opened in 2008—still has the option of expanding, while the Harvard market is restricted by its space.
MORE THAN JUST FOOD
The Harvard market sells 16 different types of products, which according to a few of the vendors, makes it a relatively small market. The Allston market represents an even smaller range of products.
“This market does not have as broad a range in terms of variety as other markets I’ve been to,” Sue Ventura, a vendor at the Allston Market says. “Nobody sells eggs, cheese, or meat, for instance.”
“A lot of people come but few are shoppers,” she adds. “The number of people coming to the market has been decreasing every year. This is my least productive market,” she adds.
“[It’s] a bit out of the way...and not surrounded by very much,” Allston market customer Gerald Robbins says. “It caters to wealthy people.”
Olmsted says she has been trying to give both of the markets a boost in other ways, such as organizing cooking demos and scavenger hunts.
Attempts to make the market stand out are paying off to some extent at the Harvard market.
Carolina R. Portillo, a recycled glass jeweler at Harvard’s market, praises the market’s organization, saying, “They make it easy in terms of parking, and they set it up so that it’s very affordable [for us].”
Portillo adds that as a tiny local business, commercial advertisement is not a viable outreach option for her. The Farmers’ Market at Harvard, then, provides her with the ideal customers.
“People who are looking for things which are one of a kind,” she says.
FINDING THE MARKET COMMUNITY
Harvard market vendor Casey Cubito points out that the Harvard market gets a wide range of customers.
“You get to meet a lot of different people like students, faculty, and tourists, of course,” Cubito says.
Allston market vendor Pete Silvia says that even with such a small market, it is important to maintain the sense of community.
“It was important to come every week so that the few customers who come know he’ll be there for them,” Silvia says.
According to University Spokesperson Lauren Marshall, though small, the Allston market still serves a specific purpose.
“The market...brings more public programming and activity to the Barry’s Corner area,” Marshall writes in an e-mail. “With every market, there are differences based on location, foot traffic, customer base, number of vendors. The Allston Market...provides an opportunity for small local vendors just starting out to come to the market.”
But noting that the Allston Market is surrounded by Harvard-funded programs such as the Education Portal, batting cages, and an ice rink, Ventura argues that “we do have customers that come who live in the area, and they don’t have that high an opinion of Harvard.”
For Ventura, this community wide effort might merely be “save face and improve [Harvard’s] image in Allston.”

After guard Aaron Miles was released from Golden State this afternoon, the Warriors’ roster was cut down to the league maximum of 15 players. If there was any worry that Jeremy Lin ’10 would not make the team (and there should not have been as Lin has a guaranteed contract), those concerns are now immaterial.
Miles, who was Lin’s primary competition for third-string point guard, actually outplayed Lin for much of the preseason. Playing in all six games, the Kansas-product averaged 3.5 points, 2.2 assists, 1.8 rebounds, and .83 turnovers in 14.0 minutes per game. But Golden State ultimately chose to add size over speed to its roster in retaining former UConn forward Jeff Adrien and dropping Miles.
For his part, Lin has had an up-and-down preseason. In his first game, Lin—a Palo-Alto native—delighted the home crowd by putting up seven points, three boards, and two assists in 11 minutes of action against the Los Angeles Clippers. In his second game, however, the rookie faltered. Warriors coach Keith Smart pulled Lin after just one minute of play in which the former Harvard guard committed three straight turnovers.
Lin played two ineffectual minutes in the next game at Sacramento before recording a DNP at Portland. He rallied somewhat in the next game against the Trail Blazers, contributing five points (all on free-throws), two rebounds, and two assists, but once again turned the ball over twice. Lin did not appear in Golden State’s game last night against Phoenix.
Although Miles’ departure might suggest more playing time for Lin, his preseason performance—3.3 points, 1.3 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 1.0 turnovers in 6.0 minutes per game—has dictated a gradual acclimation to the NBA.  The Warriors have two more preseason games—both against the reigning NBA-champion Lakers—before opening their season next Wednesday at home versus Houston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Welcoming back old friends and old people that you don’t know is a timeless event that everyone holds very dear to their hearts. Homecoming season is getting underway in the Ivy League!  And so is hockey season! Two Moores hailing from the Ivy League are playing in the NHL, while on a hockey rink in Ithaca, the Cornell men’s team will pick on little teenagers representing their country. Ah, exciting! Oh wait, save some of that excitement for the very late Midnight Madness-like event to hit Providence this Friday. Lets see what’s on tap for this week’s Around the Water Cooler.
Homecoming is finally here! Well not for Harvard yet, but for Columbia, as the Lions will host Dartmouth in New York. This season, Columbia has had mixed results, starting 1-1 in Ivy League play, while the Big Green is still looking to get its first win on the road in 13 games. Dartmouth will hope to spoil the NYC party and then head home for its own homecoming event, which it wants to celebrate in grand style against the Crimson.
Mike Moore (not the same Moore who produced Hollywood docs Sicko and Fahrenheit 9/11) made his NHL debut last night for the San Jose Sharks to become the eighth Princeton graduate to play in the league. Another Moore has also been excelling so far in the young NHL season, but this one used to go to school here in Cambridge. Dominic Moore ’03 has tallied four goals and an assist in five games for the Tampa Bay Lightning.
More news on the Tigers. The women’s basketball team has recently launched a blog-like feature on the Princeton Athletics website called “Through the Eyes of the Tiger.” Every week a player will talk about the trials and pressures of being on the Princeton women’s basketball team. I predicted that the Tigers will vie for a top spot in the Ivy League in the recent media poll, so we’ll see what drama will be brewing this season directly from the source.
Back to men’s hockey, please. The Cornell men’s team will play in two exhibition games: one against an international opponent, the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres, and another against a team that plays international teams, the U.S. U-18 National Team. Quebec recently lost to Dartmouth, so the Big Red should have no problem disposing of this sorry excuse for a Canadian team. And as if this beat down wasn’t sufficient, Cornell will then play against high school kids who are 0-3 against NCAA Division I teams. It’ll be a fun weekend for Big Red fans.
Brown is also looking to start off its weekend on a celebratory note. Friday evening, the Bears basketball program will lure students to come out and watch the men’s and women’s teams scrimmage each other with $100 gifts cards, free tickets, and complimentary jerseys. I guess that’s what it takes to get a crowd to watch two teams that went 5-9 in Ivy League play last year. Cool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team has had both bad and good luck so far this season. The bad includes the injuries that have ravaged its depth chart. The good—the blossoming players filling the holes on the field. When a concussion sidelined senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, sophomore signal-caller Colton Chapple stepped up to the plate as the starter and has found a rhythm with new players, especially sophomore tight end Kyle Juszczyk.
Last week in a loss to Lehigh, the pair connected on five passes for 58 yards, including a 17-yard touchdown strike in the second quarter.
Juszczyk has made a strong impression ever since his arrival on campus. As a freshman, he appeared in all 10 games, tallying 128 receiving yards on 11 catches with touchdowns against Columbia, Dartmouth, and Princeton. Against the Lions, he also had a team-best five catches for 42 yards.
Juszczyk’s passion for football was born in the fifth grade when he was the ball boy for Cloverleaf High School in Lodi, Ohio—the team on which his brothers played at the time and he would later join.
“Being around [my brothers] and being with the high school team got me interested in football,” Juszczyk explained.
As a high school student, Juszczyk played multiple positions and was the captain of the team for two years. On offense he played quarterback, running back, receiver, and tight end, and on defense he played inside linebacker. A true jack-of-all-trades, Juszczyk believes that playing all of those different positions in high school made a difference in how he plays today.
“It’s been a good transition,” Juszczyk said. “I did a lot of different things in high school and that helped me—like playing quarterback and running back and receiver. It made me a better receiver in college.”
Just as his switch from high school to college was relatively smooth, Juszczyk has handled the transition between freshman and sophomore year gracefully.
“I think there’s been a big difference between freshman and sophomore year. Freshman year you’re learning a whole new playbook, a whole new place to live in, all new people. It’s pretty overwhelming,” Juszczyk said. “Sophomore year, I’m definitely settled in. I have a year under my belt. It’s more comfortable this year, and I’m a lot more confident.”
As the new quarterback stepping onto the field, Chapple’s first career touchdown pass was to Juszczyk—a nine-yard completion in the Crimson’s win over Lafayette. Since that play, the relationship between the two players has continued to grow. Over Harvard’s past three games—against the Leopards, the Mountain Hawks, and Cornell—Juszczyk has become one of Chapple’s go-to targets.
“He’s got great hands and runs great routes, and he’s a big target,” Chapple said. “Tight ends are really a quarterback’s best friend.”
Ironically, the tight end and the quarterback really are close friends as the two have a strong relationship both on and off the field. In fact, the sophomores are roommates in Pforzheimer House. Chapple believes that friendship makes a difference in the pair’s performance on the gridiron.
“The trust factor is definitely a big part [of the game],” Chapple said. “I trust that if I give him the ball, he’ll make a play.”
The Crimson has benefited from the duo’s rapport in its last three games. Aside from the five catches and 58 receiving yards against Lehigh, Chapple and Juszczyk hooked up for a combined four receptions, 32 yards, and a touchdown against Lafayette and the Big Red.
The bond that the two have formed has become a team joke because of their unique relationship.
“The coaching staff kind of jokes that he’s paying me to throw him the ball because we’re roommates,” Chapple said. “But I’ve loved playing with him these past three games.”
Juszczyk agreed with his teammate.
“It’s just kind of special,” Juszczyk said. “After the game, my family meets up with his family. It’s pretty cool...to be able to say that we’re playing together out there and making stuff happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior guard Max Kenyi has taken a voluntary leave from the college for personal reasons, he told The Crimson last night.
“I’m taking a year off,” said Kenyi, who played in 17 games and started 13 for men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker last year, averaging 3.3 points and 13.5 minutes per contest.
The Gatorade Player of the Year in Washington, D.C., as a senior at Gonzaga College High School, Kenyi had been one of the jewels of Amaker’s first recruiting class at Harvard.
But his athletic style of play never seemed to quite translate to the college level, at least on the offensive end.
The wiry-framed Kenyi made his largest impact for the Crimson as a stopper, often taking the opposition’s toughest perimeter assignment.
As a sophomore Kenyi was hobbled by an MCL injury sustained last November, though he would remain one of the team’s top defenders after resuming play at the beginning of the Ivy season.
He said he plans on continuing to play basketball for Harvard when he returns.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s so easy to forget. To forget the joy of wind at your feet or the force of an oar through water. When our pursuit of excellence becomes more urgent than our pursuit of happiness, it can be so easy to lose sight of the reasons we picked up our sport in the first place.
It’s so easy to forget, but thanks to my good friend Alex Kuschner, I never had to.
Alex’s rowing career at, and after, Radcliffe has proven to me that the greatest rewards for hard work can’t be recorded in an Excel spreadsheet or written in a resume.
This weekend Alex will be rowing in her first-ever Head of the Charles in the Alumnae Eight, and I can’t think of anyone who better exemplifies the unfailing dedication to a team and genuine love of the sport that the regatta stands for.
My strongest memories of Alex during my freshman year came not from my interactions with her but from the times I was walking in and out of the boathouse and caught her erging alone, headphones in ears, neither seeking nor receiving attention.
Her season was over. Her races were done. No one was forcing her. And yet here she was on the erg, doing what she thought was best for the team.
Sophomore year I got to know the girl inside the headphones a lot better. I learned about her thesis topic and her weather preferences. I learned that she had the biggest backsplash of anyone I knew, and that any time I rowed behind her I would finish practice soaking wet.
But more than that, I learned that Alex had a genuine, unflappable love of rowing and racing. She loved our boat, our practices, our races, our post-practice meals.
And when you’re rowing with someone so genuinely enamored with the sport, it’s hard not to join in the fun.
But like all good things, Alex’s three years on the Radcliffe Crew team had to come to an end.
“[Rowing] was without a doubt the best part of my college experience,” she says. “It’s had a huge impact on me. I didn’t realize the full impact that Radcliffe had on me until after I graduated.”
But what happens when it ends? For all of Alex’s qualities, she didn’t have the talent to row for the national team.
So Alex, a lifelong athlete who was on the track team for a year before taking up crew, took a little time off from competition until she could find her next project.
It came in the form of an email.
“It was really nice when I got the email from [assistant coach] Cory [Bosworth] telling me I was in the Alumnae Eight,” Alex says. “It gave me something to work for. I don’t want to let my boat down...It’s inspired me to join a rowing club as well.”
And so, partly in preparation for the Head of the Charles and partly because she missed the sport, Alex joined a local rowing club.
“It’s been really fun,” she says. “I feel like a rower again. After a few months of not rowing, my hands got all soft and lost their calluses...I have found a boat that’s a mixed eight that’s really fun to row with...I enjoy meeting new people, and there’s talking in the boat between pieces. It’s jokey, and we’re all there to have fun.”
Alex won’t be the most talented rower in the Alumnae Eight, which includes Olympic Gold Medalist Caryn Davies ‘04-’05 and former All-American Laura Huppert ’10, but she might just be the most enthusiastic.
“I’m really excited,” she says. “Christine [Baugh ’10] and Hup are in the boat and I don’t think I’ve ever rowed with them before. Two girls who were on the team my freshman year are rowing: Danielle Thiriot and Katie Golden. I didn’t know them because I didn’t row my freshman year. I finally get to meet them and row with them...I think it will be really neat for all the different classes to get together.”
Alex’s rowing career may not be as distinguished as those upperclassmen, at least not in terms of boat rankings and race results. But I would argue that her influence on the team has been no less profound. Anyone who’s ever rowed in a boat with her can’t help but take on her competitive zeal. Any time the going gets tough, it’s hard not to think of your teammate who really appreciates every moment she has on the water. I know that rowing with Alex has helped me put my own challenges in perspective. Every rower, every athlete has an inspiration, a teammate who motivates them to push harder and enjoy more. Alex is mine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Newsweek political commentator Ben Adler wrote an article on Sept. 22, “The Case against College Athletic Recruiting,” that criticizes American colleges for wasting time, money, and admissions slots on athletes.  He argues that colleges that recruit athletes are improperly valuing unnecessary and unpopular skills and, in doing so, are hurting their schools and the rest of the student body.  He contends that schools are wasting money on sports that no one cares about and giving up admissions spots that might otherwise go to a future Nobel Prize winner or academic. He even likens funding unpopular sports to inefficient economic policies such as farm subsidies or rent control.
But what Adler doesn’t realize is that recruiting and college athletics as a whole are so much more than just pure economics.
Adler criticizes athletics for taking away funds from what he determines to be more valuable activities like music, theater, and dance.  But who is he to say that music is more important than squash, debate more important than crew?
As an athlete on one of Harvard’s lesser-known varsity squads, I can attest to the importance of unpopular and oddball sports.  Water polo is not very well known outside of Europe and California. But I can’t think of anything that has had more of an impact on me here at Harvard. It made my transition from high school to college that much easier; it helps me to arrange my schedule and manage my time; and it nurtures a competitive edge that motivates me across the river and in the classroom. But most importantly, it has given me a group of friends and teammates who will still be there 50 years after I graduate. I know that Harvard loses money every year supporting all of its athletic teams, but there is no way that anyone can put a monetary value on the benefits that we all enjoy as a result.
Even for the students at Harvard who are not athletes, intercollegiate sports provide an opportunity to come together, to bond over competition.  Every year, the Harvard-Yale football game is one of just a handful of events that connects the whole student body. It forces us to trudge across the river and brave the cold together—all in the hopes that the Crimson can pull out a win against that other educational institution in New Haven. In the grand scheme of things, the winner of The Game is irrelevant. But it matters to the students, the alumni, and especially to the teams. That rivalry has helped make Harvard the great school it is today.
Even unpopular sports, like skiing, water polo, and squash, benefit the rest of the student body. Each sport brings its own particular culture to campus and contributes to the student community as a whole. By meeting and interacting with people from different teams, students are exposed to these cultures and become more aware of what life is like for others.
Despite all of these benefits, Adler is quick to criticize Harvard in his article, specifically mentioning that the admissions office sets aside a significant number of spots for recruited athletes rather than give them to people who might make more of an academic contribution.  At some schools, that might be an issue. But at Harvard, our athletes blend in just like any other student. We all have to meet the same admissions requirements. Every school likes to admit students with special talents. Why should some people be at a disadvantage if their talent is putting a ball through a hoop instead of playing the violin?
Like most Harvard athletes, I’m never going to have a chance to make a living by playing a sport. Very few people come here with the goal of going pro. But because Harvard has given me, along with so many other athletes on our 41 varsity teams, the chance to play for four years during my time in college, I know that I will be a more complete person, and Harvard will be a better place for all of its students.
So, Ben, are Harvard’s priorities really so out of whack? Considering the education I’m receiving, both in the classroom and in the pool, I’d say they’re right where they need to be.

This weekend Harvard Yard hosted a different kind of tourist—the Freshman Parent. Thus, with a keen eye for the signature red folders of university-affiliated visitors, our Roving Reporter sought out a handful of these frosh/parent pairs to get the inside scoop on weekend plans, activities, and first impressions.
Julia A. Constable ’14
Dr. Winifred Constable
Roving Reporter: What’s it like to have your mom here for the weekend?
Julia A. Constable: It’s cool because I never went to boarding school, so it’s fun to be able to show her all of my friends.
RR: And mom, are you excited to be here?
Winifred Constable: Of course, very excited.
RR: Had you been to Harvard before?
WC: Well, we came and did the tour last year. Also, I went to Smith for college, and I came here one weekend for a party.
RR: Oh, nice. How does it feel to be back?
WC: It’s really interesting. It’s different from what I expected. I expected most of the students to be social misfits or total nerds, but actually I’ve found everyone to be not particularly arrogant (laughs).
RR: What’s the most fun thing you’ve done so far?
JC: We’ve been here for like an hour.
WC: I want to go inside a finals club.
RR: Oh, really?
WC: Yes, I just saw The Social Network, and there’s an aura of mystique about them. I’m so curious!
JC: Curious is an understatement.
RR: Any club in particular that you’d like to see?
WC: Yes, I want to see the Spee!
Taeyoung Kim ’14
Mi Hyun Kim
RR: What has been your impression of Harvard so far?
Mi Hyun Kim: It’s very traditional. I can see from the architecture and the people that people take care of tradition and think it’s very important.
RR: Have you found anything surprising?
MK: I was surprised that the water in Canaday didn’t work well.
TK: And she was definitely surprised to see so many tourists.
RR: Where are you most excited to bring your mom?
TK: Well, I really wanted to bring her to Bartley’s, but she doesn’t like burgers. So then I wanted to show her Annenberg.
RR: What did you think of it?
MK: It was good. The food was good.
Leila L. Pirbay ’14
Mohib H. Pirbay
RR: How are you liking Parents’ Weekend?
Leila L. Pirbay: It’s cool. It’s different than seeing just students.
RR: Are you excited to be here?
Mohib H. Pirbay: Yes, of course. We’re coming from so far, so it’s an adventure. We’re from Madagascar.
RR: Had you ever been to Harvard before?
MLP: Yes, for move-in day.
RR: And how does it feel to be back?
MLP: I think it’s great because on move-in day it’s somewhat sad, but then you can come back six weeks later and it’s a wonderful moment to be able to see your daughter has already gone a long way.
RR: Is Harvard what you expected?
LLP: No, there’s a lot more partying than I expected.
MLP:  You shouldn’t say that now.
RR: What has been your most interesting experience so far?
MLP: Meeting with her roommate’s parents. It’s a window into American life.
Ian S. Anderson ’14
Lyndall P. Heyer
Scott Anderson
RR: Are you guys excited to be here?
Lyndall P. Heyer: It’s fun to come to Boston. We’re from the country in Vermont, so it’s always exciting to come to the city.
RR: Is Harvard what you expected it to be?
Ian S. Anderson: Yeah, in a lot of ways. I’ve met a lot of cool people. Overall, it went above my expectations.
LPH:  Yeah, it’s a 10.
RR: Anything surprising?
Scott Anderson: How big it is.
ISA:  Yeah, I came from a small high school—
LPH:  He only had 46 in his graduating class.
ISA:  —So it’s been great. I get to meet a lot of people.
RR: What’s the most exciting thing you’ve done so far?
SA: Going to Annenberg.
LPH:  No, probably that cooking class. We got to watch through the window.
RR: What’s been your favorite part about Harvard?
SA: Probably the Old Yard.
LPH:  The oldest buildings are our favorite. The older the better.
RR: Where were you most excited to bring your parents?
IA: I think they like Annenberg.
LPH:  We basically have to go wake him up in his dorm to get him to do anything (laughs), but his dorm is great.
ISA: Stoughton.
LPH:  Yeah, we love Stoughton.

If you’ve found yourself trapped within the Harvard bubble lately, you may not have noticed the storm brewing at Yale. Last week on Wednesday, the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) walked through Yale’s old campus chanting “No means yes, yes means anal,” as part of their initiation process.
The Women’s Center at Yale was outraged at the event. They responded in the pages of the Yale Daily News claiming DKE’s chants were “when taken at face value… a call to commit rape.”
On Monday this week, the Yaily Daily News chastised the Women’s Center in an editorial, calling the center a “radicalizing echo chamber.” In the same editorial, they accused the Women’s Center of responding with "histrionics."
They also wrote, “While the Center spent their time painting murals of their own vaginas, the rest of women were left without a public voice.”
The editorial went as far as saying “Feminists at Yale should remember that, on a campus as progressive as ours, most of their battles are already won: All of us agree on gender equality.”
This commentary has stirred up some controversy at Yale. The day after their editorial ran, the Yale Daily News published an editor’s note clarifying their position. “Without rehashing each word, we can say we regret the tone, and many of the phrases, of our News’ View,” they wrote.

Want to help make our campus greener? If you do, the Harvard University Office for Sustainability might want to pay you for the effort. For the second year in a row, HUOS is offering Sustainability Grants ranging from $500-5000—and any undergraduate or grad student is eligible to apply. The application, which is due by Oct. 25, can be found on the HUOS website, along with more logistical details about the program.
Previous recipients of the grants have held waste-free barbecues, planted gardens, and created bike-sharing programs. Some grants were used to encourage composting and others to decrease waste in science labs around campus. What ideas do you have to change campus for the better?

Members of the Harvard community will be able to pick up free Harvard T-shirts at dining halls across campus starting from 5:30 p.m. today, according to an e-mail the Undergraduate Council sent yesterday.
The reason why the UC is willing to pay for 4000 T-Shirts? Yale.
Jointly funded by the Harvard Department of Athletics, the UC, and the Harvard Student Agency, the T-Shirts are intended for the Women's Volleyball game against Yale tomorrow, 7 p.m., at the Malkin Athletic Center, according to UC President John F. Bowman '11.
So if you manage to snag a shirt, you can wear it "like you paid for it or something” and “see them bring a circus of hurt upon Yale," the UC e-mail said.

Notice a large statue in The Pit of Harvard Square today? He was pretty difficult to miss—Shaquille O’Neal, the new Celtic and publicity stunt king of Boston, sat there as a living statue for about an hour this afternoon. The big man had announced his plan two weeks ago, promising to post the details of his arrival on Twitter. Then today around 1:15 p.m. the “Shaq Vs” star and now highest profile NBA benchwarmer posted that he was on his way:
THE_REAL_SHAQ: On my way to Barbara square it’s statue time
THE_REAL_SHAQ: I mean on my way to harvard square lol dam I phone my fingers r to big statue time
O'Neal's whereabouts were given away shortly before 2 p.m. by the arrival of a red van with a small Shaq logo on the back outside of Au Bon Pain. Soon enough, the 7 foot 1 inch giant emerged, sporting a black hoodie, for a quick stop at ABP and then the completion of his "statue time" mission.
As a throng of students, locals, and tourists swarmed Shaq, the NBA center showed off his acting talents honed in classic films such as “Kazaam,” smiling a few times but masking it by shifting from one classical pose to another. To the dismay of some fans and the media, he never spoke or broke his living statue promise during the hour he stayed. The one-time genie seemed at ease in his temporary role as a statue, even as police got noticeably flustered by the constant challenge of keeping some breathing space around him.
When the hour was up, The Real Shaq himself told reporters, “I can now tell everybody I went to Harvard.” O’Neal’s interest in the school is not new—he’s also gone on record as saying he could hold his own in several classes if he felt like it, since he is a “camouflage geek” (presumably, he meant to say “camouflaged” rather than imply that he is a geek for camo gear).
Though he was gone all too soon, many students got through the crowd to snap a quick picture before Shaq disappeared, his only trace a thank-you note for attendees on his Twitter account.
For those of you who missed O’Neal this time around, he will be at Celtics home games this season, where he will have a great chance to reprise his role as a master of sitting still.
Otherwise, keep an eye on Shaq’s Twitter and you may witness a Harvard return of the Shaq-tue.

“She went to Exeter?” This thought might have crossed your mind a lot lately. Although the private school does send a number of students to Harvard each year, it is not the explanation for this past week’s notable surplus of “Exeter” shirt sightings.
The source of these shirts was actually the Exeter Group, a consulting firm located in Cambridge. Exeter Group reps stationed outside the Science Center passed out 1700 shirts over the past few days, which students wore in hopes of receiving prizes—including a mountain bike and various gift cards.
According to Louis Gutierrez, a representative for the firm, this “fun and popular technique” was part of Exeter Group’s annual recruiting campaign. Gutierrez also dispelled rumors of a boarding school connection: “We aren’t named after Exeter. We don’t try to affiliate with them,” he said.
But just how successful was this advertisement campaign? The shirts may have caught the attention of other students on campus, but the long-term impact might be somewhat limited.
“It didn’t really influence my thinking,” said Robert B. Krabek '14. Krabek, the proud recipient of a $10 Borders gift card, said he “didn’t even know what Exeter Group was until a day later.” He did say, however, that he is excited to spend his $10.
And what about those who actually attended the boarding school? Exeter grad Peter F. Chase '14 said he thought the shirts were a joke at first but eventually realized they were part of a business ploy. But in the end, he wasn’t bothered by it. “It made me feel nostalgic, it made me think about high school,” he said.

At around 7 p.m., a LMA shuttle hit some of the scaffolding at the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Bow St.
According to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Edward F. Mahoney Jr., the fire department is currently trying to determine if the streets and sidewalks around the affected site are safe.
No one on the shuttle or in the surrounding area was hurt, Mahoney said, but some of the windows on the LMA shuttle were broken.
