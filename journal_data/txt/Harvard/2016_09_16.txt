After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Son of Zorn,” which premiered Sunday on Fox, stars Jason Sudeikis as Zorn, a He-Man-esque warrior from the island of Zephyria, seeking to reunite with his estranged family in California. Zorn quickly finds that his savage ways stand out in Orange County, and hilarity ensues. It would be a disgustingly standard fish-out-of-water comedy if not for one delightfully experimental twist: Zorn himself is an animated cartoon, while the rest of the sitcom is shot in live-action.    
Before anything else, some credit is due here to 20th Century Fox for green-lighting such an unconventional production. Even if the result were entirely unwatchable—it’s not—the show would still be more interesting than the forgettable safe choices typical of network television.
But now the interesting question: What did this hybrid production look like on the screen? Long story short, animation blows reality out of the water. When Zorn’s onscreen, it’s hard to look at anything else. Even during the brief moments in which Zorn is not on camera, everyone and everything seems lifeless and washed out. Animated characters, it turns out, are more colorful, more exciting, and, ironically, more lively than any real person could possibly be.
Needless to say, the unexpected pull of animation has an effect on the rest of the show. If Jason Sudeikis were actually standing there in the flesh, it would be clear what an obnoxious character Zorn is. And it seems that’s the intended structure of the show: Zorn’s ex-wife, Edie (Cheryl Hines), and his son, Alan (Johnny Pemberton), put up with his comic but frustrating impositions. Due to the animation effect, however, Zorn proves too irresistible to be obnoxious. When he gets bored with Edie’s fiancée, Craig (Tim Meadows), it’s hard to blame him: Craig is boring. When Zorn talks to Edie herself, it’s hard to remember that she is still on screen. Another time, Zorn takes Alan out to dinner and orders them both steaks. Asked how he would like them cooked, Zorn responds simply, “Not.” Alan announces then that he’s a vegetarian, because he, unlike his father, is “informed.” Everyone should of course be able to choose what they eat, but in that moment Alan comes off as totally unsympathetic. Throughout the premiere, in fact, Alan is whiny and self-absorbed.
If anything, “Son of Zorn” ends up as a somewhat unintentional critique of Orange County, with its endless rows of dull suburban houses. Zorn repeatedly tries and fails to talk to fellow passengers wearing headphones in planes and taxis, in a bit probably designed to show his tactlessness and lack of understanding of the modern world. But the passengers come off as much ruder than Zorn: Seen from the outside, listening to music and refusing to acknowledge the person sitting next to you scans as unfriendly and cold.
The only character not blown off the screen by Zorn is his new boss, Linda (Artemis Pebdani). Her success is largely due to framing; Zorn occupies a much smaller percentage of the screen during his scenes with her. But it also helps that Linda, instead of just expressing exasperation over Zorn’s hijinks, actually engages with him in a back and forth conversation.
“Son of Zorn” is probably not a show with staying power. Audiences are unlikely to care about Zorn’s quest to reunite with his estranged family when the structure of the show itself forces them into the background. An entire season seems like a stretch for this sitcom, let alone more than one. But a single episode? Fascinating.

To the editors:
We read with interest Zuneera Shah’s column, “Trouble in Financial Aid Town,” in which she calls for more effective communication from the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid to international students receiving financial aid.  Her kind words about the generosity of our program were appreciated—in fact, some may not know that Harvard College is one of only a very few colleges and universities committed to need-blind admissions for international students, and is able to fully meet their demonstrated financial need through institutional grants.  This has been true for many decades, and we include in all students’ aid awards allowances for travel, books, and personal expenses.
It is a federal requirement that all colleges and universities withhold taxes for international students receiving awards above the cost of tuition and fees (our awards cover all costs, including room and board in addition to personal expenses).  At Harvard, this withholding is handled by our Student Financial Services Office, and they send clear and detailed communications to students, for whom this is required twice annually, when those charges are required to be applied to their accounts. Entering international freshmen also participate in a week-long orientation at Harvard, during which they receive detailed information about financial aid, including tax withholding and how to recapture that money by filing a tax form.
In addition to the communication sent by Student Financial Services, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid reaches out individually to international students with tax withholding in January, reminding them to file tax forms to reclaim that money and welcoming them to let us know if they have questions or need additional help. We let them know at that time that we will cover any gap between their tax withholding and their federal tax refund with scholarship assistance.
Finally, the University International Office reaches out to these students each year, informing them of the need to file tax forms and pointing them to a wealth of resources, including advice on how to file tax forms, all of which are easily accessible on their web site.
While these communications come from three different offices, we work closely with each other to make sure they are complementary and informative.
Students should feel free to visit the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid and ask questions if they are confused about how their financial aid works.  We have a remarkable program and feel fortunate to be able to award close to $177 million in need-based scholarship aid this year, thanks to the commitment of President Faust and Dean Smith and to the generosity of our alumni and donors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 16, 2016, at 10:38 a.m. 
Jackie Medeiros has been part of Harvard’s dining hall staff for 24 years—in her own words, since she “was the same age as the students I served.” In fact, working at Harvard runs in Jackie’s family. Her mother worked in the Adams Dining Hall until she retired, her sister works in the Lowell/Winthrop kitchen, and she met the father of her children in Leverett.
One of Jackie’s two sons struggles with anxiety and has been diagnosed with ADHD; at 11 years old, he already needs a weekly tutor and therapist to help him succeed in school and eventually attend college. Tutors and therapists are both necessary and prohibitively expensive—unless Harvard’s employee health insurance covers them. “I can’t afford changes to our health insurance,” Jackie says. “My child’s health and success depend on it.”
Harvard University Dining Service workers like Jackie have a lot at stake right now. Harvard has proposed shifting more healthcare costs onto workers who cannot afford this burden. They plan to raise co-pays for prescriptions, doctor visits, and even for critical tests and procedures. A slight reduction in premiums means that this new plan will save some workers money if they are young, single, and in perfect health. For most Harvard dining hall workers, however, these extra costs add up quickly and will make it punitively expensive to go to the doctor. One would hope that Harvard could come up with a more innovative approach than making workers like Jackie afraid to take their kids to the doctor.
Changes in health insurance for HUDS workers are especially frightening because the average worker makes $33,839 a year. Many work overtime hours during the school year to survive. At most jobs, full-time workers can expect year-round employment. However, many HUDS workers are laid off for several months out of the year and, as seasonal employees, cannot collect unemployment during this time. In the past, this period of layoff was much shorter, but the lengthening of summer vacation and Wintersession has reduced workers’ capacities to earn income during these months. Only seven percent of HUDS workers made the 2080 hours that is considered standard full-time work, according to data released by the University.
Harvard recently raised a record $7 billion, surpassing its fundraising goal by $500 million. Even so, the institution with the largest university endowment in history consistently fails to look out for its lowest-paid and hardest-working employees. The money required to maintain the workers’ current health-care plans and ensure a sustainable annual income is inconsequential to the university—but of the utmost consequence to workers.
Though we include these numbers to speak to the ease with which Harvard can meet its workers’ needs, it is Harvard’s moral obligation as an educator of future citizen-leaders and as an employer to do so, regardless of financial means.
After months of negotiations with the administration, HUDS workers are now planning to strike. As students, we must stand by HUDS, even if the administration attempts to divide us from them by saying that the workers aren’t justified in their concerns, that those concerns have been addressed in negotiations, or that the workers are acting in ways that are harmful to the Harvard community.
We want to be clear: Workers are not responsible for this institution’s failure to provide them with affordable healthcare and a sustainable yearly income. That failure is the University’s alone. Dining hall workers are and always have been an integral part of the Harvard community. What is harmful to them is harmful to us.
We love and believe in the potential of the Harvard community, which is why we want the administration to do better. We encourage other students to support HUDS, to learn about these issues, and to spend time getting to know their dining hall workers, all of whom, like Jackie, have stories to share. HUDS workers have our backs every day. Now it’s our turn to have theirs.


CORRECTION: Sept. 16, 2016Due to an editing error, a pervious version of this op-ed indicated that seven HUDS employees worked the 2080 hours that is standard for full-time employment. In fact, the figure is seven percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a historic move earlier this year, University
President Drew Faust approved a policy that would sanction undergraduate
members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations. In response to this era of heightened
scrutiny and regulation, final clubs—arguably the primary target of this
policy—have responded by changing their recruitment practices. Last spring, the Porcellian Club announced its decision to hold a
single-gender open punch process. This fall, the all-female Sablière Society held
a single-gender open punch, and also announced plans to become gender-neutral
by next year. The A.D. Club and
the Owl Club also
began their first-ever open punch this fall, inviting all sophomore males to
participate in the process.
Clearly, many final clubs are
taking tangible steps toward greater inclusivity, and it is commendable that
punch for more clubs is now accessible to all sophomore males or all sophomore
females. This move, however, is far from revolutionary. While many people will be able to
attend initial events, the
process will still involve the same group of people selecting new members, leaving open the possibility that
the composition of final clubs will remain largely unchanged. There is
very little reason to believe that the results of open punch will differ greatly from those of
a traditional closed punch process.
Furthermore, open punch does not address other issues
of exclusivity at the heart of the final
clubs discussion. For one, single-gender open punch does not address the gender
exclusivity inherent in these clubs. The Sablière Society has set an example by adopting a
gender-neutral punch process, and the
all-male clubs currently resisting gender-neutrality ought
to follow suit. Beyond including people of all genders, clubs could also continue to broaden
their accessibility for low-income students. Punch is a process that
often privileges the wealthy and well-connected, and membership in a final
club often comes with dues and other costs. In addition, the culture and norms surrounding final clubs
are often unwelcoming for students with disabilities and
BGLTQ members of the Harvard community, a reality which should encourage
more fundamental changes in how these organizations attract members and operate.
Finally, though final clubs and the intricacy of punch are understandably a major topic of discussion, building a more inclusive Harvard requires renewed attention to other issues surrounding social space on campus. Initiatives like last spring's efforts to increase funding for inclusive parties and events through the College and the UC were first steps towards making on-campus social life an attractive alternative to its off-campus counterparts, but increased momentum is needed.
An open Harvard will only occur through imaginative changes to all elements of campus social life. For final clubs, a truly accessible punch
process will not just invite all sophomore males or sophomore females,
but also actively strive to lower barriers to entry for people who
might not otherwise be able to join—people of all genders, people of color, people from low-income
backgrounds, people with disabilities, and people who identify as BGLTQ. We hope final clubs that have been hesitant to change begin to heed the University’s renewed pressure on them, and take this opportunity to
think proactively about how to continue to move toward greater inclusivity.

Instead of motivational posters that say “Never Give Up!” I think there should be a few posters out there that sincerely encourage people to quit. Maybe I say this because I have quit many times myself. But I think it is necessary to rethink the “never-quit” mentality that can cause people undue pain.
At its core, quitting is about failing to commit. College freshmen could promise their parents that they will not drink. Acquaintances could promise each other that they will get lunch soon. You could promise yourself that you will not skip a lecture again. These commitments are easy to quit, as taking a sip of beer, forgetting about a lunch date, or wallowing in laziness can feel inconsequential.
But some commitments are much more important. There is the commitment that parents make to raise a child. There are the commitments we make to uphold justice as American citizens. There are people who liberally commit themselves to ideals like truth or justice or love, and set themselves on a career path to develop these ideals as their life’s work. All of these commitments require a significant level of responsibility to something outside of oneself, making them all the harder to quit.
I had a glimpse of what it feels like to quit one of these commitments when I decided to quit my internship at the White House last semester.
When I started, I was ready to commit myself to an institution that was dedicated to helping the American people. But after three months, I realized I did not have the same dedication to the day-to-day government work that others had. I could not envision myself as a staffer working week after week on the details of the next roundtable or composing the next policy memo, despite my efforts to appreciate the noticeable impact this work had on others.  So I quit.
But beyond quitting my job—and thus giving up the opportunity to help the country in meaningful ways—I was also quitting on my coworkers, who needed me to help them do the same. The only reason that the whole enterprise of government can get off the ground is that there are people dedicated to making sure its promises to the public are fulfilled. And by taking myself out of this intricate web of promises with the public at its center, I made our government weaker, even by just a shade of a difference. It is not surprising, then, that quitting such a place involves a deep sense of failure given the wide-ranging costs of giving up.
Although I do not like thinking about it, quitting the White House and abandoning my public service aspirations has also left me vulnerable to leading a life that does not contribute to something greater than myself.
If quitting left me so vulnerable, then why do I think quitting can be good? I suppose that quitting is what makes committing all the more meaningful. If quitting makes us vulnerable to living without what makes us strong, then committing is simply the healing response to the pain of quitting.
Just as college students might know that opting out of a lunch date leaves you susceptible to loneliness or skipping a lecture leaves you vulnerable to ignorance, our ancestors knew that quitting on a hunt left them vulnerable to hunger. As such, the threat of being vulnerable is what makes people honor the commitments that are necessary to their survival, such as commitments to food, knowledge, or companionship. In this light, one can consider those who quit as people who are open to being vulnerable so that they may better strive toward what makes them strong.
But what can we learn from people who quit more consequential commitments? Hopefully something, since people around the world have been quitting these types of commitments over the past few years. Britain gave a vote of no confidence in the project of European unification. Turkey seems like it will let go of liberal democracy. And in the face of our nation’s failure to provide racial justice, rioting Americans have, in my opinion, gone so far as to quit on commitments to law and order.
It seems, then, that the commitments that have made people stronger and allowed them to live well have been in vain—there clearly still are those who hunger for justice or a sense of community. However, if quitting in these cases can teach us anything, it can teach us more about the nature of the thing for which we are hungry. From there, we can strive.

Theater, Dance & Media continues to grow in its second year as a concentration, offering the first dance technique course for credit, a collaboration with an internationally renowned director, and a new Asian American performance class.
Officially offered as a concentration for the first time last year, TDM boasts 17 departmental courses for the fall semester. Among the offerings is the first dance technique class offered for academic credit at Harvard, made possible through a new dance lectureship.
The lectureship brought contemporary dancer Joy Davis to campus for the fall semester. Writer and contemporary ballet dancer Mario A. Zambrano will fill the dance lectureship in the spring.
Davis’s class, TDM 142: “Contemporary Dance: Countertechnique,” has 11 students spanning all years and a variety of concentrations. Several students are involved in dance groups on campus and said they were happy to finally take a credited technique class.
“I was really excited about the opportunity to take a dance technique class for credit, and the idea of countertechnique and the principles off of which it’s based really intrigued me,” said Gabriella D. Czarniak ’17, a member of both the Harvard Ballet Company and Expressions Dance Company.
Kathryn E. Kearney ’17, director of Expressions, said the College should expand technique courses across all disciplines in TDM, such as acting, set design, and dance.
“I [have] spent a lot of time advocating for technique courses for credit at Harvard,” Kearney said. “A lot of us are coming into this with those interests but haven’t been able to come in and refine the theory.”
Also joining the TDM faculty for the semester is Daniel Kramer, the current artistic director of the English National Opera, and the director of the concentration’s production, “A Dream Play,” this semester. Kramer also teaches TDM 191: “Devising Physical Performance,” a class on developing the use of one’s body in acting.
Kramer said he was excited to be a part of TDM at Harvard and applauded its validation of the arts as an academic, career, and life pursuit.
“I believe it is so important that Harvard is finally supporting TDM, and I’d like to be a part of that genesis,” he said. “The philosophy behind what shapes the artist in the contemporary world is a very important question, and Harvard is very lucky to be shaping that in the political and economic climate.”
TDM is also engaged in larger discussions happening on campus around the push for more ethnic studies courses.
TDM and the Committee on Women, Gender, and Sexuality—which runs the WGS concentration—jointly appointed Vivian L. Huang as a College fellow this semester. Huang’s class, TDM 1229: “Asian American Theater and Performance,” is one of at least four Asian American studies courses offered this semester.
TDM Director of Undergraduate Studies Deborah D. Foster said she hopes the concentration continues to expand its scope in both course variety and course content.
“We are interested in theater at Harvard to go beyond its Western traditions. TDM is intent on broadening its scope in that regard,” she said.

Recent controversy around a 1960s review of sugar, dietary fat, and cardiovascular health has muddled problematic industry sponsorship with spot-on findings, according to some nutrition professors at Harvard's School of Public Health.
D. Mark Hegsted, the New York Times reported Monday, was one of three nutrition professors who in the 1960s accepted roughly $50,000 from the sugar industry to publish a review downplaying the links between sugar and heart disease. The Times article, as well as subsequent media attention, came after researchers at the University of California, San Francisco uncovered documents that implicate a trade association then-known as the Sugar Research Foundation and the 1960s Harvard researchers, all of whom are deceased.
Several current Harvard nutrition professors said the Sugar Research Foundation’s sponsorship of the scientists—Frederick J. Stare, who founded the School of Public Health’s Nutrition department; Robert B. McGandy ’51; and Hegsted—highlights a dangerous financial dependency on industry.
At the same time, however, Hegsted’s review of polyunsaturated fats largely matches with today’s dietary recommendations, the current professors said.
“Hegsted was a visionary; he was ahead of his time. He got a lot of stuff right,” professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition Meir Stampfer said. “It’s really unfortunate he took this money from the sugar industry without disclosure.”
When Hegsted compiled his review, most scientific research indicated the harm of consuming saturated fat and the benefit of consuming polyunsaturated fat, professor of cardiovascular disease prevention Frank M. Sacks said. “And Hegsted—he did a lot of that research himself….Going with that research, I think, is very reasonable on the scientific merits.”
The research around sugar’s deleterious effects on cardiovascular health is also fairly recent. Such debates, popularized about 10 years ago, would not have taken place when Hegsted and the other Harvard affiliates were writing, Nutrition Department Chair Walter C. Willett said.
“Back at that time, like in the 1950s and ’60s, not much was known about sugar and carbohydrate in relation to heart disease,” Sacks said.
Although some low-level debate did reference sugar’s negative impact on the body—conversations prompted by British researcher John Yudkin—not much changed at that time, he said. “[Yudkin] was well regarded, but didn’t have enough data to influence the field.”
In the 1960s, Hegsted’s findings were often misinterpreted, Sacks said. According to Sacks, because the harmful saturated fat comprised much of the American diet at the time, dietary guidelines wrongly articulated a total fat reduction—even of the good, polyunsaturated kind of fat.
“They said, ‘reduce fat, and replace it with carbohydrate,’ Sacks said. “As it turned out, the carbohydrate that was available wasn’t whole grains, nuts, [and] beans. The carbohydrate was junk food.”
Forty years later, while sitting on the U.S. dietary guidelines committee, Stampfer said he tried to persuade his colleagues that sugar, the carbohydrate in those junk foods, was the culprit in cardiovascular disease.
“They didn’t buy it,” Stampfer said, adding, “The only harm in it is ‘empty calories,’ that was how it was called back then…[some said] it was fine to have up to 25 percent of calories from sugar.”
Only recently has sugar reentered the debate as problematic for consumption.
In 2013, Willett, who specializes in epidemiology and nutrition, and a colleague published an editorial in the BMJ, a peer-reviewed medical journal, in which he articulated his rationale for limiting sugar intake. That same year, Willett co-authored a review that summarized the adverse effect that sugar-sweetened beverages had on weight gain in children and adults.
Sacks further noted the difference between the problematic industry-funding of the 1960s review and the spot-on findings regarding polyunsaturated fat.
“To me it’s a fairly simple situation… that’s maybe a cautionary note,” Sacks said. “If Hegsted was doing his work now, he would have absolutely disclosed that. If he didn’t disclose it now he would take a lot of flack and maybe disciplinary action—I mean, who knows?”

Members of the Faculty Council discussed single-gender social organizations at their first two meetings of the semester in preparation for a likely Faculty of Arts and Sciences vote on whether to support a new College policy penalizing the groups.
On Wednesday, three of 12 professors who last May filed a motion in opposition to the policy spoke before the Council, which is the highest elected body in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Computer Science professors Harry R. Lewis ’68 and  Margo I. Seltzer ’83, as well as Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, gave the presentation, according to the Harvard Gazette, a publication run by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
Announced last May after a tense year of back-and-forth with club leaders, the sanctions against the single-gender organizations will prevent members of final clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions and receiving endorsements for fellowships like the Rhodes and the Marshall starting with the Class of 2021. 
The 12 professors who signed the motion argue that the College’s policy infringes upon students’ freedom of association, writing that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
Lewis and Thomas said in September they believed their motion—if approved by the Faculty—would strike down the College’s policy, because the University’s organizational statutes place the College “under the immediate charge” of FAS. Administrators have remained silent on whether they agree the motion could override the policy.
Further publicizing their views, Lewis, Seltzer, Thomas, and Government professor Eric M. Nelson ’99 on Monday published an opinion piece in The Crimson, writing that “the new policy is deeply objectionable.”
Thomas declined to comment on the details of the Wednesday presentation, saying, “I think, given the protocols around Faculty Council proceedings, I would prefer to have no comment.” Three members of the 18-professor Council also declined to comment on what the group discussed, and several others could not be reached for comment.
During the Council’s first meeting in late August, members also discussed final clubs and other social groups, Japanese history professor David L. Howell said.
“We have a sense of some of the big issues coming up on the calendar,” Howell said, which include “proposals regarding same-sex unsanctioned social organizations.”
Since Khurana’s announcement in May, students, faculty members, and alumni have responded strongly to the sanctions. The treasurer for the Harvard Corporation and three varsity coaches have written letters in support of the policy, and some alumni and professors have expressed their approval.
Others, though, have criticized the sanctions. Final club alumni, national Greek organization representatives, and former University President Lawrence H. Summers have spoken out against the College’s move. In addition, hundreds of undergraduate women marched on Harvard Yard days after the sanctions were announced, arguing the policy was particularly unfair to women.
One all-male final club, The Fly, has retained legal counsel to explore options to defy the sanctions. Some final clubs including the A.D., have started their “punch” seasons this week, several without their usual invitation-only policies in place.

Harvard’s dining services workers were leaning toward an “overwhelming yes vote” Thursday night in a decision on whether to authorize a strike, according to a spokesperson for UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union representing HUDS workers.
Votes had not been tallied at the time when Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck said workers were strongly leaning towards voting to authorize a strike. Polls closed Thursday at 11 p.m., and the results will be announced Friday morning, just before the start of fifteenth bargaining session between the University and UNITE HERE Local 26, according to Ten Eyck.
In a press release Tuesday, Ten Eyck said a specific strike deadline has yet to be set by the union, though a “no-strike clause” in their current contract will no longer bind HUDS workers after Sept. 17, the contract’s expiration date.  HUDS will provide further information about the details of a potential strike Friday morning, should the strike be authorized.
Local 26 negotiator Mike Kramer said on Wednesday workers will likely walk out of their jobs and rally at various places around Harvard’s campus should they choose to strike.
“Our members, because of this issue of annual income—compounded by the issue of healthcare costs—feel a sense of crisis in their daily lives, and if forced into a situation where they have no choice but to go on strike, they’re going to be bringing that sense of crisis out into the streets of Cambridge,” Kramer said.
Still, Paul R. Curran, the director of labor relations for Harvard, said he is “optimistic” he will be able to hammer out a contract with the union before they go on strike.
Workers are demanding that Harvard offer interested employees year-round work and a “minimum guaranteed annual salary” of $35,000 per year, as well as “creative” changes to a health care benefits package that they argue is too costly.
Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement when the strike vote was first announced that “Harvard’s dining workers currently receive highly competitive wages that lead the local and national workforce for comparable positions in the foodservice industry.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a year of of tension and discussion related to diversity at Harvard Law School, administrators unveiled a total overhaul of first-year orientation this year to acclimate students from varying backgrounds.
The revamped week-long program included sessions run by second-and third-year Law students, discussions on “Community Engagement and Equity” facilitated by an outside consulting group, and—for the first time—the presence of affinity groups.
Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells oversaw the restructuring process—a year-long project in which she consulted students and faculty to re-envision a “holistic approach” to orientation.
“We really looked at the whole shape of orientation, from the key vantage point that it’s about how do we provide an opportunity for students to feel like they are acclimated to HLS and their surroundings and what the whole law school experience is about,” she said.
Diversity and inclusion dominated campus conversation at the Law School last academic year, after a student group called Royall Must Fall began calling on the school—ultimately successfully—to do away with its controversial seal, which featured the crest of a prominent slave-owning family. A racially-charged incident of vandalism last November gave rise to a second activist group—Reclaim Harvard Law—which issued a series of demands to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in December. Their demands included reforming 1L orientation.
But Sells—and other administrators and students involved in the process—said that reforms to orientation were in the works well before activist groups emerged.
As early as last September, first-year students dissatisfied with their orientation experiences brought the issue to Sells’s attention. One of these students was now-second-year Charlie Fletcher, who felt the Law School’s orientation fell short compared to the program at the Kennedy School, where he was a joint-degree student.
Frustrated by the lack of concrete information disseminated to first-years, Fletcher took an informal survey of students and typed up a memo with his complaints and recommendations, which he submitted to Sells’s office.
Fletcher and Cameron Clark, who is now a second-year Law student and member of the student government’s Diversity and Inclusion committee and several affinity groups, also felt there weren't many affinity groups contacting incoming students at the start of the semester, leaving students feeling lost.
“A lot of marginalized students had an issue with the lack of affinity groups on campus,” Clark said. “Imagine you’re already three weeks in… and only now are you getting the opportunity to reach out to fellow black students or fellow queer students. It was a very alienating process.”
Clark and Fletcher met with Sells, and said she and other administrators in her office were very receptive to their concerns.
“We learned a lot of things from that conversation,” said Jeffrey C. McNaught, the Law School’s Senior Director of Student Affairs and Administration. “We learned that our communication approaches, our messaging, we needed to improve on.”
Sells met with students including Clark and Fletcher, student group members, and activists throughout the year—as well as faculty members who lead first-year sections—to work toward debuting a restructured orientation program in August.
Some of the changes explicitly focused on diversity and identity. The Law School brought in the diversity training consulting group Verna Myers—an organization founded by Law School graduate Verna Myers that previously authored a 2002 report on race relations at the school—to lead sessions on equity and community engagement. Session leaders talked to students about dealing with differing viewpoints and discrimination, and asked students to reflect on what they considered to be important aspects of their identity.
First-year Devony Schmidt said she found the sessions satisfying and productive, and also heard positive feedback from other first years. “The woman who led our session was just terrific–very engaging, and really made things that can be very uncommon to talk about such as racial identity very accessible,” Schmidt said.
In addition to the sessions, for the first time, administrators allowed student affinity groups to hold events for new students over orientation weekend. President of the Black Law Students’ Association Kristin Turner said their event saw “fantastic turnout,” and first-year students are already participating in BLSA activities.
“It was just a way for them to kind of find their people early,” Student Activities Coordinator Tracey-Ann Daley, who coordinated the affinity group meetings, said. “I think that was a huge thing—we got really good feedback.”
Administrators also sought to prepare students more broadly for law school by incorporating the Board of Student Advisers—a group of second- and third-year Law students—into orientation programming to answer student questions as peers, prepare first-years for their first classes, and fill in any gaps in their basic knowledge of the structure of the American legal system and the Law School.
“I know from my own Law School experience that there is the assumption that you know these things from the faculty… and you always felt that if you weren’t from a family of lawyers or knew lawyers, that somehow you didn’t have the keys to the kingdom,” Sells said. “That is what we did not want. That was the level set for everybody—that you have access.”
One hundred and seventy-two Masters of Law students submitted a feedback survey to the Dean of Students Office indicating an average satisfaction level of 4.9 out of 5 with diversity-related programming during their orientation. Sells said she is waiting to receive survey responses from two-thirds of the JD class before analyzing their evaluations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Political commentators have questioned whether Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’s young progressive followers will line up to vote for Hillary R. Clinton come election day.
At least at Harvard, the answer appears to be yes.
Sanders supporters on campus are rallying behind Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee and former Secretary of State, though with the caveat that some feel less enthusiastic about the nominee.
The so-called “Bernie or Bust” movement, that had a demonstrable presence at this summer’s Democratic National Convention, is not visible on Harvard’s campus. Justin G. Curtis ’19, vice president of the former Harvard Students United for Bernie student group, said all of the former members of his organization with whom he has recently spoken recently plan to vote for Clinton.

“When we were canvassing in New Hampshire for the primaries, we were canvassing for Bernie and they were canvassing for Hillary. It was a very amiable relationship,” he said, referring to a Harvard Democrats trip last semester. “They stand for many of the same things, so I think there should be a pretty natural transfer of support.”
Compared to other university campuses across the country, Curtis said he believes Harvard students have more readily accepted Clinton’s nomination, and himself called the DNC Bernie or Bust parades “quite frankly ridiculous.”
Several members of the Harvard Democrats, including board members, who previously canvassed and phone-banked for Sanders have offered their help to the Clinton campaign, Harvard Democrats President Susan X. Wang ’17 said. Wang added that she hopes to improve outreach efforts to former Sanders supporters across campus in the coming weeks as well, with canvassing trips to New Hampshire and phone-banking into Nevada and Pennsylvania planned for the near future.
“We are really trying to make sure to reach out to the people who were actively campaigning for Bernie and trying to get them involved with our canvassing activities,” she said. “We realize that at the end of the day we’re all Democrats and unfortunately the way the election has played out, if it’s not Hillary Clinton, it’s going to be Donald Trump.”
He Li ’16-17, who served as president of the former Harvard students for Sanders group, said everyone he has spoken to has decided to rally behind Clinton, though many were initially “disenchanted,” himself included, with her candidacy. Li said several former members of his organization are working for Clinton over the next few months running up to the election.
Both Li and Curtis attributed the successful transfer of support from Sanders to Clinton among their membership to Clinton’s adoption of elements of Sanders’s platform.
“I preferred Sanders to Hillary mostly because of his stance on campaign finance reform, and a lot of what he said actually has worked its way into Clinton’s program calling for a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United,” Curtis said, referring to a Supreme Court ruling that made it easier for corporations to make political donations. “So I think that a lot of that ideological carry over has influenced a lot of my peers to support Secretary Clinton.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard University Dining Services workers announced earlier this month that they were considering a strike during their contract negotiations with the University, a now-familiar refrain emerged: If Harvard can invest and raise billions of dollars every year, why can’t it pay its workers more?
Soon, fliers appeared under doors, on bulletin boards, and across social media, each pointing to Harvard’s success raising $7 billion in its capital campaign to argue that the University could afford to better compensate its employees. And while representatives from Harvard say University budgeting is more complicated than the HUDS campaign suggests, the movement has brought criticism to the often-touted process of fundraising at Harvard.
On Sept. 1, Harvard announced that it had passed the $7 billion mark in its ongoing capital campaign, blasting through its $6.5 billion goal with about two years left in its historic fundraising drive. Within a week of the announcement, HUDS workers launched their campaign with the 10-figure haul central to its case.
“Harvard recently raised a record $7 billion, surpassing its fundraising goal by $500 million, yet it consistently fails to look out for its lowest-paid and hardest-working employees,” reads a petition circulated in support of HUDS.
According to Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, the HUDS campaign’s rhetorical strategy—pitting Harvard’s workers against the wealthy institution—is typical among labor movements.
“It just sounds like the administration sort of screwed up ballyhooing their success in fundraising the moment this was happening,” Milkman said, referring to the HUDS contract negotiations. “The union would be crazy not to capitalize on that.”
Harvard contests the premise of the labor organizers’ message. In a statement, Tania deLuzuriaga, a spokesperson for the University, said that Harvard fundraising campaigns contribute to the research and educational goals of the institution, and many gifts are designated for specific initiatives. In short, Harvard cannot simply pull money out of a $7 billion pot to pay the workers more, according to deLuzuriagia.
“[F]undraising campaigns by their nature are long-range undertakings in terms of both vision and benefits,” deLuzuriaga wrote. “The current total includes both gifts and longer-term pledges that are paid over many years; many of these contributions are restricted, invested in the endowment and will be distributed over time.”
But to the HUDS organizers, the $7 billion figure is more a symbol of the University’s wealth than representative of available funds.
Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents HUDS, said that the amount of money necessary to properly compensate HUDS workers is very small compared to the University’s total financial resources.
“That response is an exposure to the administration's lack of humanity to a group of people who are vital to the community at Harvard,  I think it says it all—‘it’s already earmarked.’”
According to Richard A. Marker, a co-founder of fundraising advisory firm Wise Philanthropy, the salaries of employees like dining workers are not usually major selling points during fundraising drives.
“It’s not somehow that they’re so cavalier that it doesn’t matter to them, it’s usually the case that they don’t think in those micro terms,” Marker said of most major university donors. “If you’re giving $100 million, you're probably not going to ask if the maintenance person is being well paid.”
HUDS workers voted Thursday on whether or not they will strike, and according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck, workers were leaning toward an “overwhelming yes vote.”
Harvard may provide food vouchers or hire temporary contractors if the dining workers do choose to go on strike after their contract ends Saturday.

Facing a stagnant global financial market, Harvard Management Company, the firm that oversees the University’s $37.6 billion investment pool, is bracing for potentially low returns for the 2016 fiscal year, according to University President Drew G. Faust and financial experts.
After struggling to keep pace with the endowment returns at peer universities, HMC will likely announce its most recent financial returns later this month, and some Harvard officials have begun to caution that market trends may yield lackluster returns for the University. In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, the University-run publication, published Thursday, University President Drew G. Faust hinted at the possibility of unsatisfying returns.

“At a time when endowment returns look like they will be constrained maybe for some time to come, people across higher education are very concerned—not just at Harvard but more generally—about how we respond,” Faust told the Harvard Gazette.
If the returns on other large university endowments and investments funds are any indication, Fiscal Year 2016 will not be a banner year for HMC. At least seven public universities with endowments over $1 billion have reported losses so far this fiscal year, a downward trend financial experts attribute to global volatility. In the last few years, Harvard has returned between five and 15 percent on its endowment—a trend that potentially stands to change after the latest fiscal year.
“Essentially the market didn’t do that well, and that’s why they’re not going to have very high returns,” said Roger G. Ibbotson, CIO of the hedge fund Zebra Capital Management. “They’re really conditioned on what happened to the stock market.”
For universities with large endowments widely spread out over financial markets, worldwide economic slumps can be near-unavoidable, said Charles A. Skorina, who manages a firm that recruits financial executives.
“There were no big enough home runs to help Harvard, which has a very big endowment. That’s why most of the endowments are reporting such awful figures: they just had nowhere to go,” Skorina said. “There was no cookie jar full of cookies. They were all empty.” 
Low endowment returns could come as the University continues to raise record-breaking amounts of money during its capital campaign, which recently surpassed its $6.5 billion goal. While Harvard announced a $7 billion intake with about two years of fundraising left to go earlier this month, Faust warned that a successful campaign cannot sustain the University’s budget alone.
“The campaign is not a substitute for good endowment performance,” Faust told the Harvard Gazette. “But it can, in some ways, help us counter some of the constraints that might otherwise limit our ability to dream new dreams and introduce new initiatives.”
The potentially poor returns, if in line with broader market trends, would be the most recent in a series of complications HMC has faced over the past few years. This summer, Stephen Blyth resigned as the CEO of the Management Company after less than two years in charge, again casting the financial organization into uncertainty. His departure follows shuffling at the helm of HMC, where even a single percent in returns amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for University programs and funds.
Still, discussions about any kind of spending constraints will only take place once “we look at how those endowment returns come in, depending on what they turn out to be,” Faust told the Gazette.
Even if returns are disappointing,  said David L. Yermack ’85, a professor of finance at New York University, Harvard’s investment horizon is long enough to avoid a major budget crisis.
“You don’t take a direct hit immediately in the budget,” Yermack said. “You have many many years to make the money back; you still have good years as well as bad years.”
While Harvard’s endowment grew at a faster rate than the national average for endowments in fiscal year 2015, it trailed the pace set by some peer institutions. Last fiscal year, HMC posted a 5.8 percent return on its endowment, while Yale, Princeton, and MIT returned 11.5 percent, 12.7 percent, and 13.2 percent, respectively, on their endowments.

UPDATED: September 18, 2016, at 11:16 p.m.
Harvard’s dining service employees voted 97 percent in favor of authorizing a strike should the University not comply with their demands of increased minimum salaries and more affordable health care benefits, according to Tiffany Ten Eyck, their union’s spokesperson.
A strike, though, would not be immediate, said Michael Kramer, the lead negotiator for Local 26, the Boston-based bargaining unit that represents HUDS.
“In two weeks, if we haven’t reached a just agreement, our members are ready to strike,” Kramer said, addressing a crowd of workers gathered in front of the Graduate School of Education’s Gutman library Friday morning to announce the results of yesterday’s vote.
A  total of 609 ballots were cast in Thursday’s vote, with 591 “yes” votes and 18 “no,” Kramer said. Harvard and its dining workers will bargain today, the last negotiation session before the union’s contract expires on Saturday. An additional bargaining session is scheduled for Sept. 27, at which a federal mediator will be present to facilitate the contract talks. 
Workers have demanded that the University extend year-round work to interested employees and set “minimum guaranteed salary” of $35,000 for those workers.
Tania deLuzuriaga, a University spokesperson, reiterated in a statement Friday that Harvard “deeply values the work of its dining staff." DeLuzuriaga specifically referenced the average tenure of a dining services worker—12 years—as a “testament to the quality of work opportunities” available at Harvard.
Crista Martin, spokesperson for HUDS, wrote in a statement Monday that the University has a “contingency plan to ensure a minimum of disruption for the community” if employees go on strike, but said she would not share specific details unless the workers strike.
Several members of the Student Labor Action Movement—an undergraduate group that has supported several campus unions during their respective negotiations—were also present at the announcement. Anwar Omeish ’19, a member of SLAM, said a petition the organization circulated in support of HUDS’s decision to strike had garnered more than 2,400 signatures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The story of the 2016 Harvard football team starts where the story of the 2015 team ends.
November 21, 2015. A clear evening in New Haven, Conn. The final fans have vacated the Yale Bowl, leaving the place in mausoleum silence.
Beneath the empty stands and scoreboard that still reads HARVARD 38, YALE 19, the Crimson is dissolving. Seniors hug each other and spray champagne. They remove jerseys that they will never wear again.
Fifteen starters. Nine first-team All-Ivy selections. Six NFL prospects. The Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year at quarterback. Jointly they have achieved enormous feats; jointly they leave an enormous hole.
In this way, the 2016 Harvard team embodies an age-old riddle: How many ship planks can you replace without changing the name of the ship? How much talent can the Crimson graduate without losing its characteristic dominance?
These questions will come to life tonight at 7 p.m., when Harvard kicks off its 143rd season with a home tilt against Rhode Island.
“The only benchmark, the only metric that we’re looking for is a W,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “If you don’t have some butterflies and adrenaline on game day, then something’s wrong.”
No one expects a close game. The Rams (0-2, 0-1 CAA) finished 1-10 last year, conceding 35 or more points six times; so far this year, they have lost 55-6 to a middling Kansas team that went winless a year ago and 35-7 to Albany at home.
Moreover, as much as the Crimson has changed, vital facts remain the same. For example, captain Sean Ahern: The two-time All-Ivy defensive back returns as a fifth-year senior, and he promises to wreck havoc in the secondary.
The appeal of the opener hardly lies in the suspense of the outcome. After all, Harvard has won 14 straight nonconference matchups, dating back to 2011.
Rather, the appeal lies in the extent to which the Crimson will dehorn the Rams—whether the hosts will resemble a first-week program (which they are) or whether they’ll exhibit the polished confidence that fans have come to expect.
Stakes are especially high for senior Joe Viviano, a top-50 quarterback in high school who has yet to complete a college pass.
A year ago, Viviano broke his right foot in preseason, halting an apparently even competition with then-senior Scott Hosch. Since then, Viviano has recovered from that injury—not to mention a broken left foot last winter—and stands as the starter.
“I’m excited to see what the offense is going to do,” Ahern said. “Being a defensive guy, this might’ve been the best offensive preseason we’ve had in a while.”
But Harvard’s strength may lie on the defensive line, where the team possesses enviable depth. Murphy hopes that seniors Doug Webb, Miles McCollum, and others will provide season-long stability.
The rest of the defense follows a different narrative. Besides Ahern and a few senior holdovers, new faces round out the unit.
“There’s guys out here that are young and inexperienced, but they know how to play,” senior linebacker Eric Ryan said. “They want to play. They’ve been fighting to play, from the spring all the way up to this moment.”
In last season’s matchup with Rhode Island, however, defense hardly mattered. Harvard racked up six touchdowns and strolled to a 41-10 route.
Of course it’d be a mistake to dismiss an opponent as an automatic win—even one that has never beaten Harvard.
The Rams boast a pair of game-tested quarterbacks in sophomore Wesley McKoy and senior Paul Mroz. As a whole, the team has some athleticism, with five offensive linemen over 300 pounds—four of them freshmen—and a speedy sophomore receiver named Khayri Denny who burned the Crimson for a 62-yard touchdown last year.
But these offensive weapons look like slingshots compared to the full arsenal that Harvard possesses.
Last year then-freshman Justice Shelton-Mosley broke out for 589 receiving yards and eight total touchdowns; this year there are 25 more pounds of him. Also returning is senior tight end Anthony Firkser, who caught 54 passes over the last two seasons despite playing behind NFL prospect Ben Braunecker.
The run game has less definition, as a committee of backs including junior Semar Smith and sophomore Noah Reimers will take snaps. They’ll run behind a revamped offensive line that will depend on senior Max Rich and junior Larry Allen Jr., especially in the early season.
For one more night, then, Harvard lives in a zone of uncertainty. Players are names on paper. Numbers on a roster sheet.
Only by rushing onto the turf of Harvard Stadium will these athletes shake off their flimsy half-existence. Only then can they step out of the shadow of a dynastic senior class and into the Friday-night light of a new season.
“We’re definitely a work in progress,” Ahern said. “There’s a lot of new faces…[but] we’re ready to roll. It’s been a long preseason.”

Playing in its fourth consecutive road game, the Harvard women’s soccer team entered Thursday looking to close out the trip with a split as it prepared to take on the University of New Hampshire.
And riding high after a victory over Providence this past Sunday, the Crimson (4-3-0) remained aggressive, putting up 14 shots en route to a 2-1 victory.
Senior forward Karly Zlatic proved to be the Harvard hero, scoring the winning goal in the 72nd minute off an assist from sophomore midfielder Zayne Matulis.
“Our mindset was to keep the momentum going from our last win against Providence,” co-captain Carly Rotatori said.  “[The win] feels great, especially on the road and right before we hit our first Ivy League game against Penn next weekend.”
Harvard spent the final minutes of the game vigorously defending its lead. As a result, save for one shot in the 84th minute, UNH (3-3-2) was never able to pose a serious threat late.
Last week’s Ivy League Co-Player of the Week, Midge Purce, set up the winning strike with her speed on the left side, passing the ball off to Matulis just outside the penalty box as she began to draw defenders.
Matulis completed the play with a dump pass to Zlatic, who was able to shove the ball into the bottom left corner of the net.
“UNH sat in defensively on us by playing a 4-5-1,” Rotatori said. “Having to solve that problem, learn from our mistakes on the fly, and play much better in the second half was an important challenge for us to both face and figure out.”
Senior goalie Lizzie Durack, coming back from two consecutive absences, played the second half and made two saves, while sophomore Danielle Etzel started the game and allowed UNH’s lone goal in the 22nd minute.
Despite dropping the first two games of its road trip, the Crimson now sits one game above .500 having capped the stretch with two consecutive wins away from home.
“I don’t think we were necessarily worried,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said.  “We had a game plan, a lot of things we’ve been working on.”
Nonetheless, Hamblin needed to prepare for a talented Wildcat team. Senior goalie Mimi Borkan, who made six saves on Thursday, entered the contest sporting a 1.05 goals allowed average.
Meanwhile, junior forward and midfielder Brooke Murphy began the week with four goals and one America East Player of the Week nod to her name so far this season.
Murphy was able to add one more to that total on Thursday, tying the game at one midway through the first half, but her efforts ultimately would not be enough to lead her team to a win.
Senior forward Joan Fleischman scored an early goal for Harvard when she converted 13 minutes into the game off a pass from junior midfielder Dani Stollar.
Purce, Harvard’s leading scorer this season, also propelled the offense, swiftly driving down the field to take six of the Crimson’s 14 shots and five of the team’s eight shots on goal.
On the other end, the Crimson was able to shut down UNH’s style of play for most of the night, holding the Wildcats to just four shots in total.
“I think UNH played a counterattack style,” Hamblin said.  “They wound up getting numbers behind the ball and trying to counter-attack when they could.  We did a nice job moving the ball, and we really did penetrate their set-up.”
“[We wanted] to work on a couple things we pin-pointed from [the win against Providence] that we needed to change,” Rotatori added.  “Moving the ball more quickly, going forward, and keeping good defensive and attacking shape in the midfield.”
