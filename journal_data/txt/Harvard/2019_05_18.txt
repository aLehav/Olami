After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Set “a few years from now,” “Bacurau” is gloriously unworldly. It starts in space, ends with the apparition of a ghost, and is fueled by premonition. As co-directors Kleber Mendonça Filho and long-time collaborator Juliano Dornelles prod viewers to suspend their disbelief through the film’s fantastical moments, they carefully guide them along the way to understanding the perils of modernization, positioning the fictional town of Bacurau at the sweet spot between the past and future, premodern and modern society.
Teresa (Barbara Colen) returns to her hometown of Bacurau in Brazil to pay homage to her late grandmother and the town’s matriarch, Camelita. Following her passing and music-filled funeral procession, Bacarau seems inflicted with a dark twinge of magical realism: Several community members are mysteriously killed, a drove of horses stampedes into town during the middle of the night, a small flying saucer follows a man home, and Bacurau no longer shows up on satellite maps. In actuality, a group of American tourists recruited by a German officer (Udo Kie) are masterminding the downfall of the town and surveilling its people through its UFO-resembling drone. Though their motives are unclear, they get a sensual thrill from killing, so much so that when two members interceed a fleeing car with machine guns, they start having sex right by the murder site. While Bacurau’s community is characterized by its strong sense of codependency — exemplified when Teresa arrives and a flood of people gather to carry and pass on her luggage into her home — membership among the “white gringos” can be abruptly terminated with a bullet to the chest, which certainly happens more than once. To them, killing is a fun game: “I came here for the body count,” one particularly enthusiastic member announces.
Besides the incessant killing, the Americans indulge in a lifestyle that is an ironic blend of old and new: They rely on high-tech gadgets like futuristic drones and earbuds that somehow sense any presence of danger, yet they pride themselves in only using “old school” guns, perhaps in reference to the way modern society romanticizes and appropriates the aesthetics of premodern mechanics. Nonetheless, they seem to believe that their technology gives them a pass to treat rural Brazil as their personal hunting ground. Bacurau, on the other hand, is resistant to the excess of modernity: Though its inhabitants use cell phones, they rely on an emcee-like character who announces all news, both personal and public, through a mic connected to a speaker. Their resistance only applies to superfluous modern amenities, however: They welcome, for example, the vaccines that Teresa brings from outside town.
Tony Junior, a local politician whose relationship with Bacurau has devolved, also starkly contrasts Bacurau’s values. As soon as his video-projecting truck drives within an audible radius of town, everyone hides in their houses so that Tony has to make his flaccid attempt at reconciliation through a megaphone. He brings a truck full of books, food, and medicine as voting bribes, though the townspeople are quick to realize that most of the food is long expired and the medicine has addictive and harmful side effects. Tony is therefore the promise-happy, yes-man politician who sidesteps the implications of his actions for the sake of his public image, making him all too familiar to modern audiences.
Though Teresa’s homecoming sets the film into motion, Filho and Dornelles redirects the focus to a set of eccentric townspeople who endeavour to defend Bacurau before it’s completed erased from the map. Her boyfriend, Pacote (Thomas Aquino); the town’s alcoholic doctor, Domingas (Sônia Braga, who also stars in Filho’s “Aquarius”); and local town hero Lunga (Silvero Pereira), each equipped with enough acting chops to carry the film alone, fight for more than just their people’s survival — they fight for the ideologies that bind them together. Similarly, the Bacurau that Filho and Dornelles construct isn’t so much a utopia as it is a proposed philosophy, one that challenges the endless developments of modernization and knows how much moderate change it really needs.

E-commerce giant Amazon delivered a reported number of 5 billion packages through its Prime program in 2017. Online shopping has become a staple in the lives of many, and has given way to a new economy for package deliveries. Director Ken Loach’s new film, “Sorry We Missed You,” which premiered in competition at Cannes, follows the path of Ricky Turner (Kris Hitchen), a British middle-aged father who hops on the package delivery train in an attempt to finally secure enough financial stability to get his family a home of their own. The film opens with tough boss Maloney (Ross Brewster) of the package depot, who brags to Ricky about giving workers the chance to work their own hours and being their “own bosses,” clearly glorifying their jobs. What starts out as a hopefully humorous film soon plummets into a gripping story about the everyday and a cleverly crafted commentary on the rise of zero-hour contracts.
Ricky’s troubles are compounded by those his family faces, and his inept attempts to handle it all. Debbie Honeywood gives an endearing performance as Ricky’s wife, Abbie; Rhys Stone plays their detached and angsty teenage son; and Katie Proctor shines as the angelic daughter, Liza Jane. One of the film’s shortcomings, however, is that Ricky is not likable enough to be pitiable until late in the plot. Right off the start, when Ricky doesn’t have enough money to buy the truck needed for his delivery job, he’s quick to sell off his wife’s car, which is essential to her job as a caretaker for the elderly. On top of already working long hours with set pay, she now has to take the bus, stretching her work days. Ricky also misses several opportunities to connect with his son, who’s clearly struggling as he faces potential expulsion from school after repeatedly playing hooky.
In many other episodes, Ricky fails to step back and empathize with the struggles faced by the rest of his family, and whenever Abbie mentions a pressing need or difficulty in her job, he tries to outdo her by bringing up some kind of problem that he’s dealing with at work. He may be the one earning most of the money in the house, but his self-indulgent attitude also prevents the viewer from developing a sense of compassion for him. Ricky’s complicated imperfections do also ground the film in reality, however, and avoids oversimplifying the circumstances surrounding economic difficulties faced by most families. The strength of the film comes from a pragmatic depiction of what can easily happen to any average citizen when an earnest attempt to work harder and climb through society just backfires. And when all odds are stacked against Ricky’s favor, one can’t help but sympathize with the father who’s being stretched in all directions, and his inability to stop working despite the obviously detrimental effect it’s having on his life and the rest of his family. The ever-present dark bags under Ricky’s eye reflect his constant state of stress and anxiety.
Despite Loach’s natural take on technology like the package tracking “guns,” some of the other technological parts in the film are cheeky, at best: In one scene, Liza Jane Snapchats a selfie while eating cereal after school, and another depicts one grumpy customer who tries to sarcastically say his last name is “Big Data,” which feel too forced.
In true British character, expletives abound throughout the film. Even with the constant banter between characters, the dialogue is at times imbalanced, some scenes filled with heavy conclusions while others veer off to empty conversational chatter. It’s an attempt at capturing everyday life, but it also makes the pace of the film sometimes clunky. When Seb is arrested for shoplifting at a local store, the policeman gives an uninterrupted lecture praising Ricky for showing up and urging Seb to be thankful for his family. But Paul Laverty, who wrote the screenplay, also includes dialogue scenes that demonstrate important points. In one scene in which Ricky and Abbie lay in bed before they go to sleep, Abbie confesses to Ricky that she’s been having nightmares that they’re trapped in quicksand, no matter how hard they try to get out. “We just keep sinking deeper and deeper,” she says, and unfortunately, her nightmare is reality.
Loach is known for his grim and thoughtful explorations of societal problems. His last feature film, “I, Daniel Blake,” which traces the struggles faced in the welfare system by an honest British man, took home the Palme d’Or Prize at Cannes in 2016. Though “Sorry We Missed You” may seem extreme in some of its details, the working conditions are also corroborated in real anecdotes reported by Amazon truck drivers: They have had to pee in water bottles, face mockery for injuries suffered on the job, and work with intimidating depot managers. Loach’s critical take on the new and growing industry begs a serious evaluation of how its rapid rise in scale has unforeseen detrimental effects on society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the heart of Paris, a group of young teenagers draped in French flags joins hundreds of others donning blue, white, and red. There’s a collective moment of tension as everyone holds their breath and fixes their eyes on the TV screen — a second later, they erupt in cheers with French flags in hand, hugging each other and lighting sprinklers that fill the hazy horizon of the Arc de Triomphe with gray smoke. A sea of blue, white, and red saturates the streets and seems to temporarily dissolve all divisions within the city. It’s the city-wide celebration for France’s World Cup victory in 2016 — but it very well looks like the triumphant end of a revolution.
So begins Ladj Ly’s debut feature “Les Misérables,” which pits a Parisian police trio against the black Muslim population they torment in the French suburb of Montfermeil. Plot-wise, it has little in common with Victor Hugo’s 1862 epic, though Stéphane (Damien Bonnard), the newcomer to the anti-crime brigade, notes, “Things haven’t changed much” since it was written. When a tattooed circus crew show up at the Mayor’s front door and accuse one of the kids of abducting “My Johnny,” who turns out to be a lion cub, Stéphane, along with Chris — a toxically masculine rule-flouter who embraces his nickname “Pink Pig” — and Gwada (Djibril Zonga) — who remains largely complacent to Chris’ exploits — endeavor to track down the kidnapper and navigate city-wide tensions of race and power in the process. While the film could be mistakenly simplified as just another critique of police brutality, Ly constructs a vastly more complex landscape that brings nuance to deeply rooted racial and social tensions, though he sidelines and simplifies some civilian voices.
Even before the height of the conflict, the police and the black Muslim community emphasize allegiance to their respective communities. “No solidarity, no team. Without a team, we are alone,” a police officer tells Stéphane on his first day of work. “Respect your elders,” a Muslim brother gently tell the children after they’ve been disruptive in mosque. “We only have each other.” Without mentioning the other, each side has painted a clear divide between us and them, setting the framework from which they will then approach the forthcoming strife.
But tensions do not just exist on the meta scale; they also divide the police troupe. Stéphane, the well-intentioned, naïve newbie, is the much needed voice of morality, especially as Chris continues to push the limits of his power. The two could be seen as good cop and bad cop — but, unfortunately for Stéphane, Chris is in charge and pushes him to dangerous new lows. When Stéphane takes initiative to frisk young suspects of the robbery, a boy’s mother comes outside to scold him, and he instantly apologizes. Chris chastises, “You got told off and apologize. Are you in customer service?”
Their search was misplaced, as they quickly find the real criminal to be a young Muslim boy named Issa (Issa Perica), a trouble maker who’s well known for his lawlessness (and couldn’t resist posting a photo of himself with the cub on social media). After a police officer fires a flash-ball during an unruly confrontation, Issa becomes the figurehead for all of the children, whose fear of the police is so ingrained that they instantly run away when they see a police car. Perica doesn’t speak much, but he doesn’t have to: He is precociously impassioned in his role, channeling a profound anger that emboldens others and becomes nearly frightening in its severity.
While these principal four protagonists are complex and nuanced in their motivations, Ly neglects other voices that need to be heard. Though the film does address many crucial facets of discrimination — race, religion, and even age — gender goes completely unaddressed. The sole female police officer has less than a minute of screentime, during which she flirts with Gwada, and the only other women shown are the children’s mothers who only serve as sources of information — they are accessories to the plot, rather than complete characters. In other words, it’s glaringly obvious that the director is male. Some of the other characters also feel underdeveloped to the point that they become archetypes, such as the Mayor (Steve Tientcheu), whose appetite for justice is warranted but simplified, and Salah (Almamy Kanoute), the stoic restaurant owner who speaks wisdom in the form of Quranic metaphor. Ly’s film is definitely one step forward in the cinematic world of political dialogue, though the next step will hopefully encompass more perspectives.

In many ways, “Hatsukoi” (“First Love”) fits the mold of a formulaic action thriller: There’s a handsome underdog hero with a tragic past, a damsel in distress, a conspiring gang member, and a revenge-hungry femme fatale. Even its title is unoriginal, with a dozen movies and TV series with the same name. What differentiates this film, however, is its self-awareness — Takashi Miike, a Cannes regular and prolific director who relishes in the violent and eccentric, has created a bloody, sharp drama that pokes fun at its own genre by amplifying its elements, from the action-packed sequences to many of the archetypal characters.
Set over the span of one night in Tokyo, the film opens with Leo (Masataka Kubota), a young, promising boxer whose career is threatened when he is diagnosed with brain cancer. (That he was abandoned by his parents as a baby is apparently not enough for Miike — he gives Leo a terminal illness, too). While he might not have had much ambition before — “Without the drive, you’ll lose,” his coach reprimands after he loses a match — the doctor’s prognosis of imminent death emboldens him to selflessly care for others. When he runs into Monica (Sakurako Kanishi), an innocent woman sold into prostitution to pay off her abusive father’s debts to the yakuza, he becomes her “protector” of sorts and is quickly entangled in the drug-smuggling scandal that she’s unknowingly implicated in. Meanwhile, baby-faced mobster Kase (Shōta Sometani) devises a covert mission to leave the yakuza and recruits the law-bending police officer Otomo (Nao Ōmori) to help. Their plan quickly devolves in every way possible, and what ensues in the latter half of the film is a bloodbath in which each group faces each other in an empty warehouse maze.
Comedy is Miike’s weapon of choice to highlight the absurdity of gore in his film and the genre at large. In the opening sequence, a forceful punch during Leo’s match sets off a concurrent scene in which a freshly decapitated head falls to the ground, still blinking. More often than not, humor finds its place in Kase, who doesn’t necessarily enjoy killing people but doesn’t hesitate to pull the trigger when push comes to shove. When Julie (Maimi Yajima) realizes that he has murdered her boyfriend, who is also part of the yakuza, Kase exasperatedly retorts, “Why do you have to be so difficult!” and knocks her unconscious by unfastening her seatbelt and repeatedly speeding up then braking the car. After dragging her body home, he sets an incendiary bomb that’s triggered by a barking toy dog. Miike makes each murder (or attempted murder) uniquely ludicrous, as if to ridicule the tendency of action films to rely on sensational gore, and then laugh along with his audience.
The other characters also desperately want their nemeses to suffer, and prolong their murders for dramatic (and comedic) effect: “Don’t get out of this by dying!” Julie screeches after she stomps on her would-be captor’s head. The fighting scenes consequently become almost performative: When the stoic chief of the yakuza and one-armed leader of the rival Chinese gang face each other in a final showdown, they ceremoniously cock their guns before setting them on the ground, and draw clean samurai swords to use instead.
Just when the humor-filled fighting begins to feel cheesy, the film erupts into colorful cartoon animation, complete with speech bubbles, as three survivors escape from battle in a car. Though this change in aesthetic is visibly jarring (especially considering that the preceding action takes place on streets only dimly lit by street lights), it’s evidence that Miike knows precisely what he’s doing, and has been carefully turning up the dial of absurdity during the film. Julie, who becomes a kind of femme fatale figure after she seduces then kills her kidnapper, progresses into full-blown craze, dragging around a steel crowbar barefoot with dried blood on her face. Kase makes for a remarkably clumsy conspirator with a penchant for creative murder tactics, and his own nefarious plan expectedly backfires on him. It’s fitting, then, that only comic book animation can represent the cartoonish violence and borderline caricatures that Miike remarkably develops in “First Love.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An independent review of the Cambridge Police Department’s conduct towards a black Harvard undergraduate they arrested last April found the officers had complied with departmental policies, according to a report released Friday.
“I carefully considered all of the evidence and circumstances and conclude that the officers of the Cambridge Police Department acted appropriately and I found no evidence that they used excessive force,” wrote former Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Roderick L. Ireland, who led the review.
CPD officers arrested the student after a physical confrontation on April 13, 2018 — the night of Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring concert — on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest.
That night, officers responding to multiple emergency calls arrived at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street, where the student stood just feet from campus. Four police officers spoke with the student, who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics, for a few minutes before the student took two steps toward one of the officers, according to video footage of the incident and a police report filed at the time.
After the student took one step back and raised his arms to chest-level, an officer behind the student tackled him to the ground. One officer punched the student’s head, and another officer delivered five punches to the student’s stomach in an attempt to subdue him, according to Ireland’s report.
The forcible arrest of the student drew allegations of police brutality. Shortly after the incident, the Harvard Black Law Students Association issued a statement condemning the arrest and disputing CPD’s version of events. A CPD report filed at the time had stated the student was acting in an “aggressive manner.”
In the weeks after, College students formed the group Black Students Organizing for Change, which held a protest in Harvard Yard and circulated a letter criticizing administrators’ response to the arrest.
CPD announced in May 2018 that Ireland would lead an independent investigation into the department’s own internal review that later found that officers did not violate their policies. Both the CPD and Ireland’s report recommended changes to the way officers handle comparable arrests in order to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Ireland recommended that CPD train officers to handle mental health issues more effectively, bolster their relationships with community members via a public forum, examine officers’ conduct internally, and periodically consult experts about best practices. He wrote that the role of police officers has shifted from a “warrior” to a “guardian” more broadly.
“Such outreach is important, because it is difficult for the average layperson to look at this particular incident in isolation from the numerous cases that have occurred across the country in which black men have been subjected to overreactions or excessive force from police officers,” he wrote. “Rightly or wrongly, any event involving police will be looked at with some skepticism and questioning.”
Cambridge Police officers went through new intervention and communications trainings at the beginning of this year, according to a press release. CPD also announced that Harvard Psychology Professor Mahzarin R. Banaji will lead implicit bias training for its officers in June.
The University launched its own, separate review of the April arrest last year. Former University President Drew G. Faust formed a committee to review the circumstances that led to the arrest. Their report, released in November, suggested changing Yardfest, hiring front-line mental health professionals, and streamlining a set of alcohol- and drug-related policies.
At the time, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that he was “troubled” by student behavior at Yardfest in 2018. This year, the College scheduled the concert on a Sunday afternoon and prohibited outside guests, among other changes.
Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. said in a press release that he plans to continue discussions with BSOC.
“As a follow-up to the issuance of this report, I look forward to building upon and advancing the conversations we have established with Harvard’s Black Students Organizing for Change,” Bard said. “We are also committed to making Command Staff and other members of the department available to meet with interested residents in the City of Cambridge to discuss the report, its results and general inquiries about the Department, as we did in the weeks initially following the April 2018 incident.”
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment on the results of the independent review.
