Harvard Postdocs Call for Increased Pay in Open Letter to University
Emmy Award-winning comedian, writer, and producer Larry Wilmore will address the Harvard College Class of 2023 at this year’s Class Day on May 24, the University announced in a press release Friday.
Wilmore hosted Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore” from 2015 to 2016 and served as the “Senior Black Correspondent” on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” from 2006 to 2014.
“It’s an absolute honor to be invited by the Class of 2023 to speak,” Wilmore said in the press release. “This is a pivotal moment in their lives, and it’s a joy to be able to share whatever wisdom I can and hopefully generate a few laughs in the process.”
In addition to his roles on screen, Wilmore has written for “In Living Color,” “The Office,” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” Wilmore is also the creator of the 2001 sitcom “The Bernie Mac Show” and was an executive producer for the ABC television series “Black-ish.” He currently hosts a podcast, titled “Larry Wilmore: Black on the Air.”
Class Day, which typically takes place the day before the University-wide Commencement, is an annual tradition that celebrates graduating Harvard College seniors. The ceremony includes remarks from a keynote speaker, the dean of the College, and students.
Wilmore will deliver his address to graduating seniors at Tercentenary Theatre. One day later, actor Tom Hanks will speak at the University’s 372nd Commencement.
The College’s Senior Class Committee, which is composed of senior class marshals, has selected a Class Day speaker to address graduates each year since 1968.
Athena Q. Ye ’23, first marshal and co-chair of the speaker selection committee, said in the press release that the committee is “so excited to welcome Mr. Larry Wilmore as our Class Day speaker.”
“From his early days acting to his work producing and writing some of the most popular and influential TV shows of our generation, his voice in the media has made a lasting impact by challenging traditional ideas of race and politics through his prowess in comedy,” Ye said.
Last year, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 delivered the College’s Class Day address to the Class of 2022, where she called on graduates to seek change through the pursuit of truth. The University also welcomed back graduates from the classes of 2021 and 2020, whose ceremonies were postponed by Covid-19.
Actress Adjoa Andoh addressed the Class of 2021 during their Class Day dinner, while actor and producer Ashton Kutcher spoke to graduates at a Class of 2020 dinner.

In Wake of Schrag Bullying Allegations, Harvard ESE and EPS Affiliates Call to Strengthen Anti-Bullying Policy

Eighty Harvard students, alumni, and staff demanded Harvard administrators strengthen protections against bullying and harassment in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department and Environmental Science and Engineering program in an open letter Thursday.
The letter, circulated in response to a Crimson investigation that revealed bullying and toxicity allegations against top Harvard climate scientist Daniel P. Schrag spanning two decades, calls for transparency around disciplinary measures for affiliates who are found to violate misconduct policies and a “clear threshold” for launching misconduct investigations in response to “repeated informal complaints.”
According to the letter, the two programs “have a longstanding problem with faculty bullying and harassment that has plagued the experiences of graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff” and hindered research and education in both programs.
“Unlike the phenomena we study in our research, there is no mysterious force at work here,” the letter reads. “What we are dealing with is as straightforward as it is destructive to the community we have built together and cherish.”
In The Crimson’s investigation, published last week, more than two dozen current and former students, colleagues and staff said Schrag created an environment of hostility and fear in ESE and EPS.
Following an internal Harvard inquiry, in spring 2021, Schrag was barred from accepting new lab members for half a year, required to undergo external behavioral training, and asked to step down as Environmental Science and Engineering area chair, a position akin to department chair, The Crimson reported.
Schrag did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Previously, Schrag declined to comment on specific allegations discussed in The Crimson’s investigation, but wrote in an email that he is “deeply committed” to his role as a mentor.
“I sincerely regret if I caused some students distress, as my intent is and always was to help my students become the best scholars they can be. Supporting students and researchers at all stages in conducting the most critical and impactful research remains my highest priority,” Schrag wrote.
The open letter was circulated and authored in part by the GeoClub, an ESE and EPS student organization that runs social events and communicates student concerns to administrators.
Andrew C. Pendergrass ’20, an ESE Ph.D. candidate and GeoClub co-president, said one of the goals of the letter was to make sure the students who have left Schrag’s lab “feel supported and that they don’t feel at risk for retaliation because they have a whole community at their backs.”
The letter asks administrators to publicize the measures taken when someone is found to violate a misconduct policy.
“There’s not a lot of publication of graduation rates within a certain group or if there were sanctions against certain advisors,” Andrea M. Salazar, an EPS Ph.D. candidate and GeoClub co-president, said. “You kind of have to depend on this whisper network of current grad students talking to incoming grad students.”
Schrag “was removed as chair, and no one knew,” added Pendergrass, a former Crimson Magazine editor. “It was not communicated.”
The letter also calls for clarification or revision of sections of the new University-wide anti-bullying policy that will take effect on Sept. 1, 2023. It calls for “a clear threshold by which repeated informal complaints about a single community member will trigger a university investigation.”
Under the new policy, each school will select two types of officials: those who act as a “designated resource” to provide resources and field complaints and “appropriate officials” who have the final say on sanctions. Any formal complaints are evaluated by a three-person panel of neutral Harvard faculty or staff, who submit a recommendation to the school’s appropriate officials.
The letter demands instead that the “Determination Panel’s decision should be the final determination of any sanctions,” rather than this power being invested in the schools’ appropriate officials.
“I think there’s no reason to have another step of someone who has total power to accept or decline” the panel’s recommendation, Pendergrass said.
The letter also criticized Harvard’s rollout of the anti-bullying policies, saying they were created “without meaningful engagement and follow-through” and calling on the school to extend the period for collecting feedback from affiliates.
According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, the draft anti-bullying policies were developed with several opportunities to collect feedback. The original window for affiliates to provide feedback on the draft policies lasted from April 2022 to the end of September 2022.
Newton declined to comment on other aspects of the letter.
The letter also requests “procedures by which departments can enforce their own codes of conduct.” According to Salazar, “When it comes to enforcing these anti-bullying and harassment policies, it seems like no one is totally sure who has the jurisdiction over what.”
The letter is addressed to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, Science Dean Christopher W. Stubbs, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III.
“This is a broader issue, not just in EPS and ESE but across the University,” Salazar said. “We just want to protect all grad students and to form universally good workplace environments.”
In a joint statement, Doyle and Stubbs confirmed they received the letter and “are working with the EPS and ESE department and area chairs to respond.”
“We are committed to creating a supportive environment where all members of our community can thrive and do their best work,” they wrote.
EPS Chair Ann Pearson, EPS Director of Graduate Studies David T. Johnston, and ESE Area Chair Steven C. Wofsy did not respond to a request for comment.
Despite the public discussion of issues within the ESE and EPS working environments, “it’s not just all negative,” Pendergrass said.
“We have a great community. We have this GeoClub. We have all these wonderful friendships and everything,” Pendergrass added. “This is more like bringing out the good in the community and removing the bad than it is a whole condemnation.”

Naked and Afraid of Finals: Students Let Out Stress by Streaking Through Harvard Yard
The man accused of planting a fake bomb on Harvard’s campus as an accomplice in an effort to secure a “large” amount of Bitcoin from the University, according to a criminal complaint, was released on an unsecured bond with conditions at a hearing Friday.
William A. Giordani was arrested on Tuesday and charged with aiding and abetting interstate conspiracy and making extortionate threats following a joint investigation by the Harvard University Police Department, the Cambridge Police Department, and the FBI.
Authorities allege Giordani placed a tool bag containing a metal safe, wires, and fireworks on a bench in Harvard’s Science Center Plaza as part of a fake bomb threat that led to the plaza’s evacuation on April 13. 
According to the Boston Globe, prosecutors indicated at Giordani’s hearing Friday that they believe he did not act alone in the incident, with Assistant U.S. Attorney John T. McNeil noting during the hearing that “the dust hasn’t settled” on whether Giordani was manipulated or acted as the scheme’s “mastermind.”
A criminal complaint alleges that Giordani told police that he had been directed to place the bag in Science Center Plaza through an April 11 Craigslist advertisement by someone under the name “Nguyen Mihn” who claimed to be the Vietnamese parent of a Harvard student, according to the filing.
Giordani told authorities that he traveled to Worcester, Massachusetts, to receive payment from the man, but the man refused to meet with Giordani and admitted he was not Asian and did not have children as the ad claimed, according to the complaint. Giordani also said the man was “spouting off” racist and antisemitic comments during the call, according to the filing.
After being temporarily appointed at a Tuesday hearing, Federal Public Defender Jane Peachy was named Giordani’s attorney Friday. Peachy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Giordani’s sentencing bond condition requires him to enter a substance abuse treatment program and avoid Harvard’s campus, according to the Globe.
Peachy told the Globe that Giordani is committed to getting “clean and sober,” and it appears “he was duped” by the Craigslist ad.
Authorities have not arrested any other suspects in the case.
According to court records, on April 13, HUPD received a series of calls from a “computer-generated male voice” demanding a “large” Bitcoin transaction as payment. The caller claimed to have planted three bombs on Harvard’s campus and said that they would detonate in 100 minutes if demands were not met.
The filing also indicates that the caller eventually revealed the Science Center Plaza as the location of one of the bombs, leading HUPD to locate the bag and evacuate the area. Eventually, CPD’s Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit completed a “controlled destruction using a robotic device.”
Giordani is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on May 22.

Harvard Postdocs Call for Increased Pay in Open Letter to University
“When is it easy? NEVER!” cries the Harvard men’s tennis team in anticipation of the upcoming NCAA tournament.
This motto is symbolic of the squad’s impressive mental and physical strength that propelled them to be crowned the Ivy League Champions for the second year in a row. Harvard was selected as the eleventh seed in the NCAA tournament and hosted the first two rounds today and Saturday at the Robert M. Beren Tennis Center.
“We are all super excited for the tournament,” junior Ronan Jachuck said. “We've had a great season so far and we've got a lot of momentum coming off the Ivy Championship that puts us in an excellent position to host the first two rounds.”
The tournament’s round of 64 kicked off with Harvard’s defeat of Siena College and the University of Illinois’s defeat of Arizona State University in Cambridge, Mass. today. Harvard and Arizona State will battle for a spot on Saturday to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.
The Crimson has had a stellar regular season — finishing 19-5 (7-0, Ivy)  and ranked inside the top 15 in the International Tennis Association (ITA) Division I Collegiate Men’s Tennis rankings for the past 13 weeks.
Siena College entered the tournament with a 13-10 record. The Saints entered the MAAC Championships as the No. 3 seed and had a pair of upset wins against Quinnipiac and Fairfield to earn their first MAAC Men’s Tennis Championship in program history, and to punch its ticket to the NCAA tournament. The Saints are led by No. 1 singles player Dante Russo who has amassed 24 singles wins and 17 doubles wins this season.
The match between the Saints and the Crimson was the first meeting between the two teams in history.
The Scott Mead ‘77 Head Coach for Harvard, Andrew Rueb ‘95, sits in his fifth year at the helm of the team. In his time at Harvard, Rueb was also a standout player –– one of six players in the league’s history to be a two-time Ivy League Player of the Year –– and was inducted into the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 2013.
“The real power of our team comes from our daily training,” Rueb commented. “Everyday work has given us confidence, and put us in the place we are in right now.”
“Our coaches encourage us to just focus on ourselves, and our commitment to our own games,”  Jachuck added. “Rather than focusing on how I can counter my opponent, I play to my strengths and make sure that when the match gets close I still have the confidence in my game to go out there and execute.”
The Crimson is led by senior co-captain Harris Walker, accumulating an impressive 29-12 overall record. Walker, alongside fellow senior co-captain Henry von der Schulenburg (18-6) received first-team All-Ivy honors for singles play.
Walker and sophomore Daniel Milavsky earned first-team All-Ivy honors for doubles play, 9-3. Jachuck earned Second-Team All-Ivy honors for singles, finishing with a record of 6-1 in Ivy play. Jachuck and senior Steven Sun garnered Second-Team All-Ivy honors for doubles play, ranking up an 18-4 overall record.
“In tennis, it’s really easy to think you are just fighting for yourself. However, the love, community, and connectedness of our team make it really easy to get that extra motivation, to do the extra drill in practice, and to fight a little more in matches,” first-year Valdemar Palpe said.
“This is a close team. They have a lot of experience, and that gives us an extra edge,” Coach Rueb said. “They believe in each other  — that kind of support, care, and love really does help propel us forward.”
In preparation for matches, the team spends time journaling through different scenarios, and preparing for different outcomes, in addition to intense physical training.
“We've shown many times this year that we're a team that's not gonna go away. Whether we're down a doubles point, we're down two sets in matches, we've come back to win,” Jachuck said. “I can look around, even if we've lost the first set, and know that my teammates aren't going to go away and that the second set is gonna be a battle.”
Harvard defeated Siena College this afternoon in an impressive 4-0 sweep at the Beren Tennis Center. The Crimson dominated in doubles play – No. 62 nationally ranked duo Daniel Milavsky and Harris Walker emerged victorious 6-3. Doubles powerhouse Ronan Jachuck and Steven Sun picked up their 19th win of the season after a decisive 6-0 win. Henry von der Schulenburg had one of the most dominant performances of the season, (6-0, 6-1), only losing one game in his straight-set win. Daniel Milavsky and Ronan Jachuck both triumphed over the Saints, finishing 6-2, 6-0, and 6-2, 6-3 respectively.
The Crimson will face off against Arizona State University tomorrow at 2:00 pm at the Beren Tennis Center for a chance to compete in the Sweet Sixteen.

The Harvard track and field team is gearing up for the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, with competition beginning this Saturday, May 6th and continuing until Sunday, May 7th.
First, the team took a few athletes to the historic Penn Relays this past weekend. Sophomore Chloe Fair represented the Crimson sprinters well, running a time of 59.79 seconds to take 12th place in the women’s 400 m hurdles.
For the throwers, it was senior Stephanie Ratcliffe who set the tone for Harvard. Ratcliffe threw a new school record and personal best of 70.59 m in the women’s hammer throw to win the championship section of the event. Her throw was far enough to set the new stadium record, as well as the Ivy League record. Senior Cammy Garabian also took first place in her event, winning the college section of the women’s weight throw. Her throw of 61.47 m set a new meet record for the event.
In the same event for the men’s, sophomore Kenneth Ikeji threw 74.12 m to claim first place. His throw also set a new stadium, school, and Ivy League record that ranks him second place in the nation.
On Saturday, the shot putters put up some big numbers. Seniors Alexander Kolesnikoff and Sarah Omoregie both finished top five in the men’s and women’s shot put, with Kolesnikoff taking fourth place and Omoregie taking second respectively. Both of their throws put them in the top 15 of the nation.
This weekend, Harvard will return to Pennsylvania for the Outdoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
“Biggest piece of advice I give our team is two things — one, you [have to] be able to focus on what you can control regardless of what’s going on around you and be able to go and do what is that you do,” said head coach Jason Saretsky about the advice he gives the team going into the championships. “The second piece is what we’ve been doing this season has been really great, so just continue to do what we’ve been doing.”
At the 2022 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, the men’s and women’s teams both finished in second place, behind Princeton and Penn respectively. Going into this season’s championship, the team is looking to be equally competitive with them.
“The Ivy League is a fantastic track and field conference with lots of talent throughout all eight institutions,” Saretsky said. “Obviously, if you look at the indoor results, Princeton’s men’s team was a point ahead of us and Princeton’s women’s team was close behind us.”
Although with Penn being at home,” Saretsky continued, “On the women’s side they won the outdoor championships last year, and I’m sure they’re also hungry to compete for a championship, so I think it will overall be a really competitive and exciting weekend.”
Currently, the men’s team is ranked 23rd in the nation, while the women’s team is ranked 31st, though both teams lead the Northeast Region.
“They’re grown in so many ways,” said Saretsky about the team’s growth over this season. “It’s been so wonderful and rewarding to see the competitive excellence athletically, maintaining that competitive excellence academically.
“More importantly though,” he continued, “[they’ve been] really coming together and having that family culture, looking out for one another, caring about one another, that you always want to see with a team.”
The team currently has four athletes ranked in the top ten in the NCAA. Following the championship, the athletes that qualify with the necessary marks or times will advance to the NCAA East Preliminary Round.
“We focus on being the best version of ourselves,” said Saretsky regarding the team’s overall championship goals. “Harvard track and field has a pretty rich history and tradition of success, and to be the best version of ourselves, which is a great and worthy goal of our program.”
The track and field team will travel to Philadelphia to take on the other seven schools in the Ivy League Conference at Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania this weekend.

Harvard Postdocs Call for Increased Pay in Open Letter to University
Harvard baseball (17-21, 13-5) clinched a spot in the four-team 2023 Ivy League Baseball Tournament with a dominating sweep of Columbia University (23-17, 11-7) in front of a home crowd last weekend.
The Crimson put on a strong offensive and defensive display during the three-game set to secure its fifth series win in Ivy League conference play and jump to first place in the standings, where Harvard is now tied with the University of Pennsylvania (25-14, 13-5).
The sweep of Columbia cements a remarkable comeback for the Crimson this season. Harvard struggled to win earlier this spring, with the team suffering through a 12-game losing streak for the first half of March. The Crimson, however, started to turn things around once Ivy League commenced, securing its first series victory of the season against Pennsylvania.
The Crimson outscored the Columbia Lions 23-9 over the weekend. After winning both games of a Friday doubleheader, Harvard’s offense dominated in a 13-run performance on Saturday to secure the series sweep. Harvard’s bullpen was also stellar against Columbia, with Crimson relievers limiting the Lions to just one run over the three games.
Head Coach Bill Decker said in an interview Wednesday that winning both games of the doubleheader put the team “in a good spot to have a great weekend.”
“I thought we pitched it really well all weekend. We played good defense. We got some timely hitting,” he said. “I was happy for the kids. I thought the players really prepared themselves well.”
“Now they put themselves in a position where they can do something special for this group,” Decker added.
HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 2
Junior right-hander Chris Clark took the mound for the Crimson in the first game of the Friday doubleheader.
Clark got off to a strong start by retiring the Lions in order in the top of the first inning, recording two strikeouts. Clark continued to dominate in the second inning, inducing two quick outs before the Lions recorded their first hit of the game with a single to center field. The runner, however, was quickly erased by senior catcher Zach Brown, who ended the inning by firing a bullet to catch him attempting to steal second base.
Junior center fielder Peter Messervy recorded the first hit of the afternoon for the Crimson with a leadoff double to start the second inning. Senior second baseman Hunter Baldwin followed by hitting an 0-2 pitch to left field for a single, putting runners at the corners with no outs. After Brown struck out swinging for the first out of the inning, freshman shortstop Gio Colasante hit a sacrifice fly to score Messervy and put the Crimson out in front. Sophomore left fielder George Cooper and junior right fielder Ben Rounds hit back-to-back two-out singles to score Baldwin and increase Harvard’s lead to 2-0.
Clark continued to dominate in the third and fourth innings, retiring all six batters he faced in order. Clark nearly recorded an immaculate inning in the fourth, needing just 10 pitches to strike out the side.
The Crimson extended its lead in the bottom of the fourth inning. With two outs and a runner on first base, Cooper smashed the second pitch he saw to left field for a two-run home run, giving Harvard a 4-0 advantage over Columbia.
The Lions’ offense finally managed to make some noise against Clark in the top of the fifth inning, hitting back-to-back doubles off the right-hander to score Columbia’s first run of the game. With two outs and runners at the corners, Clark looked set to escape the fifth inning without any further damage, but a throwing error by Colasante allowed the Lions to score their second run of the inning and slice the Crimson’s lead in half.
Clark, however, got the next batter he faced to end the inning with a ground out, stranding two Columbia runners in scoring position.
The Lions threatened again in the sixth inning. After Clark recorded the first two outs of the inning, he gave up a single and a double in quick succession as Columbia got the game’s tying runs in scoring position. But Clark recovered to strike out the next batter on four pitches to end the inning. Clark’s dominant pitching performance earned him the win, ending with a final line of 6.0 IP, 1 ER, 10 SO.
In the bottom of the eighth, Harvard’s offense added an insurance run when Brown hit an RBI single to center field to increase the Crimson’s lead to 5-2.
Meanwhile, the Crimson’s bullpen put on a near-perfect performance to keep the Lions off the scoreboard for the rest of the game. Freshman right-hander Callan Fang pitched the eighth and ninth innings, recording three strikeouts over two innings of work to earn the save and seal Harvard’s game one victory.
HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 4
While the Crimson took the lead early and never relinquished it in the first game of the Friday doubleheader, Harvard’s victory in game two did not come as easy. The lead changed hands five times before the final out was recorded.
The Crimson’s offense wasted no time getting started in game two as Cooper led off the game with a double to left field, immediately putting a runner in scoring position for Harvard. Senior first baseman Logan Bravo, who went 0-3 in the first game of the doubleheader, hit a one-out RBI single to left field to drive in Cooper and give Harvard an early 1-0 lead.
Harvard’s starting pitcher, senior right-hander Will Jacobsen, cruised through the first two innings, needing just 16 pitches to record six outs. The third inning, however, proved more challenging. After giving up a single to the first batter of the inning, Jacobsen retired the next two Columbia Lions batters he faced. The next batter worked a full count against Jacobsen before smashing a two-run home run to put the Lions on top 2-1.
Columbia would not hold onto the lead for long as the Crimson’s offense responded in the bottom half of the inning. Bravo got things started with a single for his second hit of the game and junior third baseman Jake Berger drew a walk to put runners on first and second base with one out. The next batter, junior left fielder Chris Snopek, lined an RBI single to tie the game and put runners at the corners. Messervy then hit an RBI sacrifice fly to score Berger and give Harvard a 3-2 lead.
Jacobsen kept the Lions off the scoreboard for the rest of his outing, putting up zeros in the box score during the fourth and fifth innings. He finished his outing with a final line of 5.0 IP, 2 ER, 4 SO, with Decker turning to his bullpen for the final four innings of the game.
Senior left-hander Tim Williamson came in for the Crimson to pitch the sixth inning. He induced two ground ball outs before hitting the third batter he faced to put a runner on base for the Lions. The next Columbia batter smashed a two-run home run on the first pitch he saw to reclaim the lead for the Lions 4-3. Williamson struck out the next batter he faced, but the damage was done with Harvard trailing Columbia heading into the bottom of the sixth.
After getting retired in order in the bottom of the sixth inning, the Crimson went to bat in the seventh inning seeking to retake the lead. With one out, a hit-by-pitch brought Rounds to the plate with the tying runner on first base. Rounds smacked an RBI double down the left field line to tie the game for the Crimson, and later advanced to third on the throw home. The next batter, Bravo, gave Harvard the lead with an RBI sacrifice fly to score Rounds and give the Crimson a 5-4 lead heading into the eighth inning.
Only needing to record six outs to secure the win, Harvard’s bullpen was lights out. Decker turned to senior southpaw Harrison Stovern to pitch the ninth inning. Stovern did not let the Lions hit the ball out of the infield, striking out the first batter he faced before inducing two ground outs to earn the save.
The win secured the Crimson’s fifth series victory in Ivy League conference play and gave Harvard a chance for its second series sweep of the season.
HARVARD 13, COLUMBIA 3
With junior right-hander Jay Driver on the mound, Harvard looked to secure the sweep and an Ivy League tournament berth in front of more than 200 Crimson faithful.
Driver started the game strong, retiring the first six Columbia batters he faced. The Lions’ fielders — more so than the Crimson’s hitters — provided Driver with some early run support in the bottom of the second inning.
After Berger drew a walk to lead off the inning, Messervy singled to right field to put two runners on base for the Crimson with just one out. The next batter, Baldwin, hit a routine ground ball that turned into a run for the Crimson after a throwing error by Columbia’s first baseman allowed Berger to score. After a single and a strikeout left the bases loaded with two outs, the Lions looked set to escape the inning without further damage. Another error, however, extended the inning and allowed the Crimson to score its second unearned run of the game.
The Lions’ first baseman managed to redeem himself in the top of the third inning, hitting a two-out RBI double off Driver to give the Lions their first run of the game and cut the Crimson’s lead to 2-1. Bravo responded just as quickly on behalf of the Crimson, leading off the bottom half of the frame with a solo home run to left field to give Harvard a 3-1 advantage.
Driver struggled again in the top of the fourth to record the final out of the inning. With two outs and a runner on first, Driver gave up a hard-hit double to put runners on second and third. The next Columbia batter singled to right field, driving in both runs and tying the game at 3-3.
Harvard, however, reclaimed the lead in the bottom of the frame with some more help from Columbia’s fielding mishaps. Cooper dug into the batter’s box with one out and runners on first and second base, and singled to center field on the second pitch of the at-bat. But instead of loading the bases, the Crimson’s lead runner rounded third and scored the go-ahead run on an error by the Lions’ center fielder.
With Harvard seeking to extend its lead, Rounds drew a nine-pitch walk to load the bases and knock Columbia’s starter out of the game. The next batter, Bravo, gave the Lions’ bullpen a rude welcome, smacking the first pitch he saw down the left field line for a bases clearing double. The Crimson would score two more runs in the inning on a wild pitch and an RBI single to take a 9-3 lead over the Lions into the fifth inning.
Driver would not give up a hit for the rest of his outing, keeping Columbia’s bats silent over the next three innings. Driver finished his strong outing with a line of 7.0 IP, 3 ER, and 5 SO. Sophomore right-hander Sean Matson pitched the final two innings of the game for the Crimson, recording three strikeouts and giving up just one hit as he sealed Harvard 13-3 win and their series sweep.
Harvard’s players have this weekend off as they transition back into students to finish all their final exams and assignments, but the Crimson will host Yale University for a three game series starting on May 13.
Despite already punching their ticket to the Ivy League tournament, the series against the Bulldogs promises to be competitive as the Crimson seeks to acquire the top seed, and perhaps more importantly, earn the right to host the tournament at home in Cambridge.
Coach Decker said that making it into the Ivy League tournament was “the first of a goal.”
“Gotta get in the tournament and then you want to get out of it,” he said.
