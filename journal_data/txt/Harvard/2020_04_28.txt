After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was getting ready to move away from home just eight short months ago, so many people told me that college was going to be the best four years of my life.
And they were right about everything except the four years part. The nights with friends, the random discussions with my professors, and the study sessions in Annenberg have made up the happiest days of my life. Those moments, which have already had such a profound influence on who I am and what I believe, are going to make Harvard the best 3.75 years of my life.
Please, Harvard, don’t reduce it to the best 3.25 years. Don’t take any more of those precious moments on campus away from us than we’ve already lost by putting classes online in the fall.
With a careful plan in place, I believe that it is possible and it is necessary for colleges to reopen in August. Boston’s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, has stated that he anticipates that students will return to Boston-area colleges in the fall.
As a student, that’s reassuring to hear. But one thing concerns me: Harvard College has committed to making a decision on the fall semester by July. University President Lawrence S. Bacow has stated his concern that there will still be much uncertainty even when a decision has to be made, and the University recently announced that Harvard “will be open for fall 2020” — indicating that it will not consider delaying the semester considerably or canceling it altogether, as many students have called on them to consider.
If there’s anything this pandemic has taught me, it’s how quickly scientific understanding, my own thoughts, and the world around me can change. Unfortunately, this necessitates last-minute decisions, not careful long-term planning.
Two months ago, I was focused on what I should order at Veggie Grill and when I should go to Widener Library to pick up books for my legal anthropology paper. Now, students are scattered across the globe, largely confined to our homes, worrying about our friends and loved ones as we watch the death toll from COVID-19 continue to climb. Two months from now in late June, our understanding of the virus will have undoubtedly changed quite significantly. Two months from then — our hoped-for return to campus — there might be a much better understanding of how this virus is spread and how to minimize risk through testing and contact-tracing.
More and more universal testing and serological studies across the world are suggesting that we’ve been undercounting cases by a very large margin. Nearly 25 percent of New York City residents may already have developed antibodies to the virus, a quickly increasing percentage that is a lagging indicator of the true number of infections by about three weeks. On the treatment side, there are also promising developments, most notably the drug remdesivir — the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study are expected within the next few weeks.
So much can change in such a short period of time. A cautious decision that seems necessary in June may not seem necessary come August.
Things will get better; the world will stabilize.
That’s why I worry that students’ and administrators’ desire for a quick decision will lead to an overcautious one.
I urge Harvard’s administration to, of course, keep our community safe above all else. But I also urge them not to make decisions that could even more seriously fragment and dilute our college experiences before it is absolutely necessary to do so.
We have shown our ability to leave campus within five days; we are capable of adapting and switching gears last-minute when necessary. That many students would consider taking a leave of absence if the fall semester were online is a testament to the fact that we are at Harvard to learn and soak up all that we can from campus life, not to get a fancy line on our resume and a nice diploma to hang on our future office wall.
Just as Harvard set the example for other universities in March by making the difficult decision to send students home, it now needs to set the example in thinking outside of the box and do everything in its power to bring us back to campus safely for the entirety of the fall semester. We know that campus will feel very different when we come back, but please don’t underestimate the lengths we are willing to go to adapt and follow new safety guidelines.
While I hope it never comes to this, if Harvard is forced to choose between making a devastating yet decisive decision in early July or holding out a glimmer of hope until later in July or August, it should wait. I would prefer a last-minute decision with the hope of a return — no matter how much chaos it might create — than yet another devastating one.
If circumstances force Harvard to keep us away from campus in September, and the administration maintains that they will not postpone or even cancel the semester, then all students must be given full, unrestricted, unconditional permission — regardless of financial aid status or graduation year or reason — to take a one-semester leave of absence. We’re at Harvard to be at Harvard, and it’s heartbreaking to think about just the nine weeks this spring that we’re missing out on. We have worked so hard and sacrificed so much for this opportunity. We can’t lose any more time on campus than we have already lost, for every moment is precious.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What to make of the “liberate” protests? Hundreds of people gathering in objection to state stay-at-home orders. For some, they epitomize what is wrong with America. Encouraged by the forty-fifth president, a critical mass of people (“critical” describing the danger of their thought, not its process) acted not only to the extreme detriment of the common good, but their own good as well. Yet catastrophe is no excuse for catastrophizing. Within these “liberate” protests I see what is best about American democracy — the right for the individual to be completely wrong about what is good for themselves and for the community.
To understand the particular strengths of democracy, it is important to compare it to the other form of government which is predominant today — authoritarianism. And especially in the era of the coronavirus, when comparisons between the responses of different governments are rife, it makes sense to specifically compare the superpower standard-bearers of each system — the United States and China, respectively.
But first, a brief discussion of the theoretical differences between the two. The key distinction between an authoritarian regime and a democratic one is how the common good is identified — whether by approximation or determination. Authoritarianism’s appeal is that a few individuals can know the common good better and faster than the people as a whole can determine it.
In practice, authoritarianism in China is effected through the principle of “democratic centralism.” Decision-making is centralized within the party elites, where a few competing factions broker a consensus which is then carried out through the party ranks. Crucially, democratic centralism prohibits significant dissent, whether from the people or the party, once the consensus has been formed. If the deliberation of the few has produced the best approximation of the common good, dissent only serves to detract from its efficacy.
Within Chinese politics, the result of this governing dynamic creates two interlocking pressures. First, there is a constant and urgent need for the leading members of the party to be correct in their assessment of the common good. Leaders cannot afford to be wrong in their judgment of the common good otherwise they themselves will be replaced. Second, to this end, the state puts pressure on the people. Consider that in Chinese “right” and “power” are denoted by the same character “权”. Because the rights of citizens would create limitations on the party’s ability to achieve its vision of the common good, authoritarianism seeks to suppress the people’s exercise of their individual interests unless it promotes the vision the regime endorses.
If authoritarianism tends toward the erosion of rights in favor of the common good, democracy — and especially American democracy — begins with the ideal of certain inalienable rights. Government is instituted by the people for the protection of these rights. Therefore, because the people define the common good themselves, the common good is the aggregate of each person’s interests and ideas. Certainly, some people’s interests are weighted more than others. But neither Citizens United, the Electoral College, nor even the Senate makes the U.S. a government of the few.
Similarly, to call the framers of the Constitution anti-populist is too limited. The framers disliked anybody who claimed that they knew exactly what the common good was, whether they were corrupt, out of touch politicians in Great Britain or local demagogues. The very system of federalism is a monument to narrow self-interest or at least a deep skepticism of an absolute common good.
Like in China, American politics involves a contest of competing interests and conceptions of the common good. However, not only is the decision-making process open to all, the contest doesn’t end once a consensus has been reached or even if one party holds both the presidency and the legislature. If the concern of the dominant figures in the Chinese Communist Party is consistently getting the right thing done, the concern for American politics is consistently getting anything done. The existence of some sort of opposition to delay, ridicule, and finally protest anything the government attempts to do is the norm for a form of government which prioritizes the group’s guess over the “best” guess, where the group is a collection of individuals with the right to determine their own interest.
President Ronald Reagan had a joke about an exchange between an American and a Russian:
“Look,” said the American, “in my country I can walk into the Oval Office, I can pound the President’s desk, and I can say ‘Mr. President, I don’t like the way you are running our country.’”
The Russian was nonplussed. “I can do that too.”
“You can?”
“I can go into the Kremlin to the General Secretary’s office, pound his desk and say ‘Mr. General Secretary, I don’t like the way President Reagan is running his country.’”
Authoritarians are going to use “liberate” protests to illustrate why American democracy doesn’t work. Defenders of democracy may as well embrace these protests because you can’t pick and choose rights when they are convenient. For better or for worse, there is no desk pounding in authoritarian regimes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Immediately upon discovering that Harvard could receive almost $9 million under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, many politicians, including President Donald Trump, expressed outrage. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter: “Dear Harvard: Thank you for my law degree and an excellent legal education. You’re very rich; many people are hurting. Now give the money back.”
Before throwing punches, perhaps the senator should have used this “excellent legal education” to read the bill he voted for. The bill, since being enacted into law as the CARES Act, automatically allocated the University $8.6 million in financial relief. Harvard did not apply for, nor request, this aid.
Still, many seemed eager to perpetuate the false narrative that Harvard single-handedly stripped money from the hands of small businesses. Trump himself demanded Harvard return the money “meant for workers.”
To be clear, the money was not meant for workers. Harvard, an institution of higher education, was to receive money meant for institutions of higher education.
However, Harvard did subsequently reject its allocated money.
The aid in question was drawn from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund section of the CARES stimulus, which allocated nearly $14 billion exclusively for higher education institutions — not small businesses. Harvard’s allocated aid was calculated by a formula specified by the bill taking into account an institution’s number of Pell Grant recipients and its enrollment — not its endowment. Even U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos admitted that “Congress required taxpayer Emergency Relief funds be given to all colleges and universities, no matter their wealth.” Despite this, many members of Congress cited Harvard’s endowment in their demonization of the University.
We find their accusations of Harvard to be a gross mischaracterization and an ill-informed attack on higher education, likely made with hopes of political gain. But more puzzlingly, they are a bizarre demonization of their own legislative choices. After all, all but one of the politicians attacking Harvard seem to have conveniently forgotten that they were the ones who voted for the stimulus package. We appreciate the hastiness of legislation in crisis, but come on, own your vote!
Other institutions were allocated massive sums of money under the CARES Act as well; Columbia University and Cornell University netted $12.8 million each, a sum both currently intend to keep. The emphasis on Harvard seems to be more rhetorical — a farcical grab at anti-Harvard sentiment — than anything else.
Why not call out other schools? Liberty University, which is known for being openly hostile to members of the BGLTQ community and has endangered its community members by reopening the campus in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, was allocated $15 million. Brigham Young University, a school subsidized by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which boasts a $100 billion tax-exempt investment fund, could receive $32 million.
The question remains, however, where Harvard should have rejected the money. In the near future, many students will likely need a larger amount of financial aid than before the crisis. This money would have helped those students, and despite some suggestion that it might go to more needy institutions in Massachusetts, there is really no such guarantee.
Moreover, we wish the University did not seem to simply bow to political pressure in rejecting the $9 million. Their reasoning for doing so — that “the intense focus by politicians and others on Harvard” may discourage participation in the relief effort by institutions with the more severe need — feels flimsy at best.
There are certainly valid criticisms of the CARES Act, not least that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients have been barred from receiving aid. Harvard might take a hint from Princeton University, which cited DACA recipients in its announcement that it would reject aid.
But in its rejection of CARES aid, Harvard got and gave nothing — neither vital support for vulnerable students nor a strong political statement about what aid should look like or how an institution should act in times of crisis. CARES, however one looks at it, was a missed opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether on campus or virtually, Harvard will resume teaching and research in fall 2020, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in a message to Harvard affiliates Monday afternoon.
As University administrators decide to what extent the coronavirus pandemic will prevent normal operations, Garber’s message ruled out one option floated by other universities and some students: delaying the upcoming semester entirely.
“A range of scenarios has been and will continue to be evaluated for the fall, from fully restored on-campus activities – a “normal” return to campus – to delaying the opening of the University until next spring semester,” Garber wrote.
“Yet for us the most important decision is a clear one: Harvard will be open for fall 2020,” he added.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview earlier this month Harvard was considering “lots of different scenarios” for the upcoming semester.
As administrators determine what precisely the fall will look like, Garber wrote that they will evaluate “epidemiological data and public health models.”
“If our community has not developed sufficient levels of immunity through recovery from the disease or vaccination, and if safe and effective antiviral therapy is not available, we will likely need adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, reliable and convenient viral testing, robust contact tracing procedures, and facilities for quarantine and isolation,” he said.
If Harvard pilots a partially or fully virtual semester, Garber wrote that it will look very different from the past several months. With more time to plan ahead, faculty will develop courses for classrooms scattered around the globe, and affiliates will “reimagine” research, extracurriculars, and professional development.
“Should we not be able to resume a fully on-campus experience, our efforts will not end with a shift to remote teaching and learning,” he wrote.
Ending his message, Garber did not rule out the possibility that the fall semester might serve as a mirror image of this spring, beginning remotely and transitioning to in-person activities.
“Even if we must begin the semester remotely, we hope to return students to campus as soon as it is possible to do so while providing for their safety and that of the entire campus community,” Garber wrote.
“In its 384-year history, Harvard has overcome many adversities, drawing on the courage and determination of its community,” he added. “This extraordinary time calls on us to build on that history, working together in ways we never have before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences expects to reach a decision on the format of its fall semester no later than July, FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in an email to faculty and staff Monday.
Gay announced in the email that Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs and Registrar Michael P. Burke will lead FAS’s planning for the fall, with the help of several faculty and staff working groups. The working groups will examine issues including curriculum, scheduling, facilities modifications, and testing and contact tracing.
Gay’s email came shortly after University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in an email to all University affiliates that Harvard will open for fall 2020, whether in person or online — ruling out the option of delaying the spring semester entirely, as other universities and some students have suggested.
Harvard moved classes online and sent students home in March due to the coronavirus, becoming one of the first universities to do so. In recent weeks, students have debated the merits of various formats for the fall semester.
Gay wrote that faculty input will be “essential” to planning, and that FAS is working on developing mechanisms for undergraduate and graduate student input. The FAS’s three academic divisions and its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have begun “convening conversations” with academic departments and student advisory groups, according to the email.
Gay also wrote that FAS faculty and staff must immediately begin planning for the potential of continued online instruction in the fall.
“The range of alternatives we will need to consider, because the pandemic will not be behind us, includes some degree of remote instruction,” she wrote. “If we decide to pursue a remote experience in the fall, we will approach it differently than was possible in the quick transition to remote instruction that occurred this spring, using the next four months to reimagine the Harvard experience for students, both in and beyond the curriculum, and to provide an entirely different level of support to faculty and teaching fellows.”
“In many ways, this option would constitute the heaviest lift for our community and for it to be viable, focused and deliberate work must begin immediately,” she added.
Gay wrote that the largest challenge FAS is facing is “how and when to stage the return” of undergraduates to the Houses, calling them “essential” to the Harvard experience.
“De-densification of the campus fractured these intergenerational communities of faculty, graduate students, staff, and undergraduates, creating a sense of loss more profound than a simple disruption in the rhythm of the semester,” she wrote.
“Harvard will not feel truly ‘open’ until all students return to campus,” the email continues. “But we will not bring students back until we can do so safely, in a manner that protects individuals and our broader community from undue risks associated with Covid-19.”
Gay concluded the email by acknowledging that FAS must be prepared to operate remotely on a long-term basis.
“The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is a residential academic community,” she wrote. “This is fundamental to our identity, as well as a source of pride and inspiration. Even as we aspire to be together again as soon as possible, our resilience through this crisis will depend on a successful transition to a safety-conscious, remote-ready institution for the long term.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard settled with the federal government for $1.3 million over allegations that a former professor at its School of Public Health overcharged federal grants, according to a Monday press release from the Department of Justice.
The settlement was a result of the University’s self-disclosure of the potential overcharges to the government in 2016, according to the release. The DOJ contended that Public Health professor emerita Donna Spiegelman misreported the time and effort spent on grants from the National Institutes of Health and Health Resources and Services Administration, allegedly overcharging grants by $1,359,791 between 2009 and 2014.
Spiegelman and the University, however, both deny intentionally overcharging the government.
Spiegelman contends that Harvard never informed her it would settle with the government, according to an emailed statement provided by her lawyer, Harvard Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen.
“Dr. Spiegelman would never have agreed to any settlement because she and her team did nothing wrong,” Gersen wrote. “Because she was not accused of wrongdoing, Dr. Spiegelman was never named as a party to any legal claim by the government or by Harvard.”
The government alleged Spiegelman and her team inappropriately charged their time and effort by evenly distributing their time across all grants for which they provided statistical support without accurately accounting for the time they actually spent on particular grants.
Gersen wrote that Spiegelman used those timekeeping practices with the approval of the School of Public Health.
She wrote that Spiegelman’s team simultaneously supported work on a large number of grants across laboratories, making it impossible to separate individual contributions. As a result, the School of Public Health approved of her practice of evenly dividing time across relevant grants for years.
“This was always undertaken transparently and forthrightly,” Gersen wrote. “At all times, she used effort-reporting practices that she understood, with Harvard’s support, to be permissible.”
Gersen added that Spiegelman “urged” the school’s administration for years to ensure its reporting practices align with the NIH’s, but her proposals were ignored.
“With this matter, Harvard has appallingly attempted to scapegoat Dr. Spiegelman for the well-known problems of mismanagement at the Public Health School,” Gerson wrote.
School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams wrote in a statement posted to the school’s website Monday that Harvard self-reported the alleged overcharging following an internal investigation.
“While neither Harvard University nor Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health admitted any liability, the University’s investigation identified effort reporting discrepancies for Professor Spiegelman and members of her research group that resulted in charges to multiple NIH awards that could not be fully documented,” Williams wrote. “As a result, the University proposed refunding $1,359,791 in salary costs to the government and the government agreed to the proposed repayment.”
“It is important to note that while this internal review identified inaccuracies in the management of time and effort reporting, the completion of the research aims and the quality of the research findings were not disputed,” she added.
The DOJ argued Harvard administrators should have known about the alleged bookkeeping errors sooner.
“HSPH did not timely review Professor Spiegelman’s historical timekeeping to determine whether she and her team had overcharged grants, despite questions being raised for several years about these timekeeping practices,” the press release reads.
Nevertheless, federal authorities “commended” Harvard for its self-disclosure and cooperation.
“It disclosed its findings, and worked cooperatively to explain the overcharges. In addition, Harvard has put in place additional internal controls and safeguards aimed at preventing overcharges from occurring in the future,” the press release reads.

A pair of prominent progressive groups have called on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee, to remove former University President Lawrence H. Summers as an economic advisor.
Bloomberg News reported Thursday that Summers, who served in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, was advising the Biden campaign on economic policy. Appearing on Bloomberg Television’s “Wall Street Week” Friday, Summers characterized his role with the campaign as informal.
“Oh, I wouldn’t over-read things,” Summers said. “The vice president and I have been friends for a long time and I’m one of many, many people who his campaign talks to, but I don’t have any formal relationship to his campaign.”
Summers, who is a University Professor, previously served as the director of the White House National Economic Council for Obama. He also worked as the 71st Secretary of the Treasury for Clinton, and as the chief economist of the World Bank.
The Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats, both of which endorsed United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Biden in the Democratic primary, released a petition Friday calling for Summers’s ouster.
“Joe Biden has a major trust gap that he must overcome with progressives and voters under 45 who voted overwhelmingly against him in the primary and who he’ll need to defeat Trump,” they wrote. “Larry Summers’ legacy is advocating for policies that contributed to the skyrocketing inequality and climate crisis we’re living with today.”
Summers did not respond to a request for comment.
The calls to remove Summers come as Biden is taking a leftward turn on some policy issues in a bid to win over progressives. Following Sanders’ departure from the race earlier this month, Biden rolled out a proposal to lower the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60. He also called for student debt forgiveness for middle- and low-income Americans who attended public colleges and universities, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
Still, some groups like Harvard College Democrats for Bernie have declined to endorse Biden, citing the sexual assault allegation he faces from Tara Reade, a former staff member in his Senate office. Biden denies the claim.
Progressives have criticized Summers, claiming that his economic policies are too centrist for what Biden’s campaign has repeatedly said will be the most progressive presidential campaign in years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and MIT researchers have found subsets of cells in the human nasal passages, lungs, and intestines that are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, according to a study accepted to the scientific journal Cell Wednesday.
The team made the discovery based on previous knowledge that the virus’s “spike” protein — the main protein that allows it to bind to and enter human cells — typically binds to two cellular proteins: ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
Alexander K. Shalek, a faculty member in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program and senior author of the study, said the team looked at which cells contained the RNA that encoded ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Researchers then used a dataset of the different kinds of RNA found in various cell types to identify specific subsets of cells that might be most prone to producing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and thus most susceptible to COVID-19 infection.
“One of the big questions to ask is, ‘Which cells within a given tissue are actively transcribing the RNAs for these proteins and therefore are likely first targets for infection?’” Shalek said.
Jose M. Ordovas-Montanes, a Harvard Medical School pediatrics professor and another senior author of the study, said the RNA data the team used does not show all information about cellular proteins, however.
“Messenger RNA encodes the potential to make a protein, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that at that point in time, that mRNA will be made into a protein,” Ordovas-Montanes said.
The team also discovered that interferon, a protein usually generated by human cells to fight viral infections, actually plays a role in increasing the expression of the ACE2 protein that binds to COVID-19’s spike protein.
“Interferon drives ACE2 — maybe for a virus that doesn’t utilize ACE2 to come in, like influenza,” Ordovas-Montanes said. “That might end up being protective, and there’s data in the literature to suggest that. But if the virus that you’re combatting now is utilizing ACE2 to gain a foothold in the host, we don’t know if there is a particular situation, a right time and place within the body, where a typically protective response can become detrimental.”
Ordovas-Montanes added that, despite the strides made in the study, scientists would need results from a “well-controlled clinical trial” to draw definitive conclusions.
“Our paper might provide some explanation eventually as to what people are seeing, but it’s far away from that,” he said.
The team plans to use their individual cell-based knowledge to help other researchers conducting analyses on COVID-19.
Shalek said he was pleasantly surprised throughout the research by the time, effort, and information volunteered by fellow scientists for his team’s work.
“What’s amazing is everybody coming together to tackle this problem, and people’s willingness to contribute unpublished data selflessly, and their willingness to support work regardless of whether or not we’d ever met them before or whether or not they knew us,” Shalek said. “It’s really cool to see the community push to tackle a problem of this level and of this nature.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge announced Monday that it will allow restaurants to sell groceries directly to consumers during the coronavirus crisis.
The emergency order will enable eateries that receive a license from the city to sell items such as meats, dairy products, vegetables, and non-perishables through pick-up or delivery services.
“This order will help support our local restaurants and alleviate pressure on grocery stores, while also making it less stressful for Cambridge residents to find critical supplies close to home,” City Manager Louis A. DePasquale and Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said in a joint statement announcing the order.
“We know that visits to the grocery store can be stressful for many residents, and we believe this order will increase food access to various parts of the city, reduce crowds, and help people support and stay connected to their neighborhood businesses,” they added.
Restaurants can apply for a license beginning May 1.
Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 banned on-premise consumption at restaurants on March 17. Since then, some eateries have stayed open for delivery and take-out.
“Anything that can add convenience to folks at home — particularly those who might be ordering lunch and their groceries at the same time — is probably a good thing,” Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said.
The coronavirus has taken a heavy toll on Cambridge businesses. Earlier this month, more than 500 Greater Boston eateries signed a letter to Baker requesting emergency relief.
At least 31 Square eateries remain open in some capacity. Three retail stores are still operating, while others continue to do business online.
Michael Monestime, the executive director of the Central Square Business Improvement District, said in a press release that the emergency order will benefit local restaurants.
“The Central Square BID is in full support of restaurants who want to temporarily sell grocery items,” Monestime said. “We believe that our businesses need every tool available to help weather this storm.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Staff at the Harvard University Archives are soliciting reflections from Harvard affiliates to document how College traditions, academic coursework, and daily life have changed as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
“People are getting wasted at final clubs, Allston bars, Weeks Bridge on the Charles River,” one reflection reads. “People are sobbing at final clubs, rooftop bars, Weeks Bridge on the Charles River. No one seems to know what to do.”
When Harvard affiliates departed from campus over a month ago, the University Archives, which is charged with preserving Harvard history, faced a challenge. How could archivists document life at Harvard — including courses, activism, and student life — when those activities were no longer taking place openly at Harvard Yard or in Sanders Theatre, but online?
With that challenge came an opportunity, according to University archivist Virginia A. Hunt. Hunt said she and other archivists felt it was urgent to create a project on the day-to-day lives of Harvard affiliates experiencing the global pandemic. Termed the COVID-19 Community Archiving Project, the initiative is requesting that Harvard faculty, staff, and students submit materials to record their lives in quarantine.
Requested items range from written reflections, to schedules of a day in quarantine, to videos of at-home exercise. Hunt said the archivists believe it is important to document aspects of daily life — even those that happen online.
“A lot of that type of thing is ephemeral and happens in social media. It happens in Zoom interactions. It happens on the web,” Hunt said.
Hunt said students have already submitted photos of their last moments on campus, descriptions of virtual Housing Day, and a poster promoting a virtual Earth Day rally.
Students in some classes are also working to record daily life, shifting their coursework from studying history to documenting it in real time.
History lecturer Caitlin D. G. Hopkins has asked students in her class, HIST 12C: “Out of the Vault: Material Culture and Harvard's Collections,” to contribute to the University Archive project.
She said cataloguing student perspectives in the archives would be valuable to future historians.
“Sometimes there’s this feeling that what we do day-to-day doesn’t have historical value,” Hopkins said. “Everyday experiences are really what historians are looking for.”
History instructor Zachary B. Nowak has also encouraged students to share their quarantine experiences. He created a student journaling project, entitled “A Coronavirus Diary,” to collect biweekly reflections from students. Nowak said more than 200 students had indicated interest as of April 23. He added that he plans to print student responses on archival cotton paper and donate them to the University Archives.
Students in HISTSCI 191CU: “Harvard's Changing Landscapes: A Contemporary History Project” were already studying changes at Harvard when the pandemic hit. The course, which was centered on Harvard’s expansion into Allston, quickly shifted its focus to documenting the public health crisis, according to instructor and History of Science lecturer David S. Unger.
Unger said his students have conducted interviews with Harvard affiliates, recording experiences and anecdotes during the outbreak. In two weeks, the class plans to launch a website, called “Harvard from Home,” to retell those stories and allow users to contribute their own.
Unger said he hopes this project will preserve “those ephemeral elements of the current situation that seem so clear right now, but are going to fade from memory.”
One memorable moment his students captured, Unger said, involved a graduate student who brought her lab animals home and was “trying to figure out how to make sea water in her kitchen to keep them alive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As many Americans seek out expert knowledge on the novel coronavirus in the midst of the pandemic, some Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School professors have taken to social media to inform the public about the virus.
Previously confined to the lab and the classroom, many such professors are experiencing an unprecedented level of public exposure, gaining mass followings by posting more frequently online and speaking to the media.
Epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch, who frequently shares his expertise with the media, has gained more than forty thousand followers on Twitter in the last month alone.
Jerome E. Groopman, a professor of medicine at the Medical School and staff writer for the New Yorker, said in an interview that experts’ use of social media can have a positive effect on informing the public, as long as the information they spread is accurate and significant.
“There’s a difference between clickbait, which takes a non-scientific, non-evidence-based, non-expert, inflammatory declaration, or out of context, versus someone who feels that his or her voice is important particularly in countering either misinformation or an argument that’s being made strictly from a political expediency point of view,” Groopman said.
He added that the public should still be wary of the types of information about COVID-19 they accept due to the rushed nature of research and media about the virus.
“It’s a very challenging time with regard to the general public for several reasons,” Groopman said. “First of all, the usual filters for quality information have been removed. So, that peer review, scientific assessment which typically filters out for quality data, have been lagging behind so that certain groups will post their results before they’re published or even peer-reviewed.”
With more than 173,000 Twitter followers, Lipsitch has used his platform to offer clarifications on news reports he believes are misinformed — namely, misrepresentations of his own quotes.
For instance, in a Thursday tweet, Lipsitch wrote that his quote in a Bloomberg News article about the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in India was “wildly unrepresentative” of what he had said during the interview.
“It misrepresents my views worse than almost any article I have ever been quoted in,” Lipsitch wrote in the tweet.
Lipsitch also recently shared a blog post by SciLine, a service connecting journalists and scientists, which offered scientists tips on communicating with the media during a “much needed” time.
“While this sudden increase in appetite for scientific expertise is in some respects refreshing, it has also resulted in a number of scientists being flooded with media requests, including those with little or no training in best practices for speaking to reporters,” the SciLine blog post reads.
Other Harvard professors, meanwhile, have used the impact of social media to dispel non-scientists’ unfounded claims about the virus.
Michael J. Mina, a School of Public Health epidemiology professor with more than 27,000 Twitter followers, offered a straightforward position on President Donald J. Trump’s suggestion that injecting people with disinfectants could help prevent COVID-19.
“Our president is such an idiot,” Mina wrote on Twitter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale issued an emergency order Monday requiring all people in the city to wear face masks in public places, businesses, and common areas of residential buildings during the coronavirus crisis.
Businesses outlined in the emergency order include grocery stores, pharmacies, laundromats, restaurants, government buildings, and office buildings. Residents will also be required to wear face coverings while entering lobbies, hallways, elevators, stairwells, laundry rooms, and other indoor and outdoor common areas in residential buildings.
On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that people wear cloth or fabric face coverings in public, citing evidence that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the coronavirus to others.
Although the city issued an advisory to wear masks in public places on April 9, some residents have not followed it, according to a joint statement released by DePasquale and Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui Monday.
“While we are grateful to those in Cambridge who have been heeding our previous mask advisory and taking this issue seriously, we are concerned about the number of residents who continue to shop, walk, run, and bike throughout the city without proper face coverings,” the statement reads.
“This mandate emphasizes the importance of wearing a face covering, not as an option, but as a requirement in our effort to combat this pandemic together,” it continues.
The temporary emergency order applies to everyone over the age of five and will remain in place until the declaration of a state of emergency in the city is rescinded. Exemptions will be provided to people who have trouble breathing or who are unable to remove the mask without assistance, according to the order.
The order takes effect Wednesday, but according to the city’s announcement there will be a “one week grace period” to allow residents time to comply.
The city’s announcement states the Cambridge Police Department will focus on “educating violators” and may issue warnings to those who do not cooperate with the temporary emergency order. Violators who refuse to comply may be charged a $300 fine.
During Monday’s City Council meeting, DePasquale said residents should continue to stay home and limit time spent in public places around non-household members.
“Residents should continue to stay at home, to wear face coverings if they need to go out, and practice good hand hygiene,” he said.
“Our emergency order requiring face coverings is not permission for people to go outside for non-essential activities,” he added.
The Cambridge Public Health Department reported that 710 residents have tested positive for coronavirus since the outbreak began, as of Monday. The city has confirmed 43 coronavirus-related deaths.
Claude-Alix Jacob, Chief Public Health Officer of CPHD, provided City Council members with information regarding COVID-19 demographics during the council’s weekly meeting.
According to Jacob, coronavirus cases in Cambridge have followed national trends by disproportionately affecting people of color — specifically black residents.
“Sadly, the patterns that we’re seeing are not surprising,” he said. “The rate for black non-Hispanic residents is nearly three times the rate for white non-Hispanic residents.”
Jacob said CPHD has worked with different groups in Cambridge to support people of color in the city — including efforts to provide information on social distancing, collaborate with “literacy ambassadors” to give educational support, and connect people with health care resources.
“While I’m sharing a sobering picture, I did want to at least acknowledge the assets that we have in the community and at least remind this group of what we’ve done historically over time,” Jacob said.
“It takes a village to raise a healthy community, and our department and city partners have been way ahead of the curve in identifying and responding to racial and ethnic health inequities in our city,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four College juniors were informed Monday afternoon of their selection for the Alpha Iota chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s oldest academic honor society.
Students are elected to the Alpha Iota chapter of Phi Beta Kappa three times a year — 24 juniors in the spring, 48 seniors in the fall, and roughly 96 additional seniors close to Commencement. Ultimately, the coterie of students elected to Phi Beta Kappa is composed of less than ten percent of the graduating class.
To gain entrance to Phi Beta Kappa, students must possess “outstanding scholarly achievement” combined with “depth of study and breadth of intellectual interest,” according to the College’s chapter website.
This year’s applicant pool consisted of 96 juniors who either had all A’s or all A’s and one A-, according to Phi Beta Kappa chapter secretary Logan S. McCarty ’96.
“We are looking for students who choose to take interesting, challenging courses and who excel in those courses,” McCarty wrote in an email Monday. “It is really hard to make these decisions. Every student in this group is outstanding.”
Social Studies concentrator Jessica A. Boutchie ’21 said she was “really excited” to be elected to Phi Beta Kappa and views this honor as a greater reflection of her academic experience.
“Phi Beta Kappa is a huge academic honor, and I am so thankful for it, but it’s also not everything,” Boutchie said. “I think it’s a reflection of how fortunate we’ve been throughout our academic careers. It’s about all the cool classes you’ve taken and the amazing people you’ve gotten to learn from.”
Hannah J. Ellery ’21, an Applied Mathematics concentrator, said her Phi Beta Kappa aspirations first began April 8 when she received the invitation to apply for the organization.
“I didn’t know much about the organization, but my mom had heard of it and said I should definitely go for it, so I did,” Ellery said.
Ellery added that her professors throughout the years have been “fantastic” with helping her hone her academic potential.
“Professor Jim Waldo, who wrote my letter of recommendation, has been fantastic. I met him my freshman year during my freshman seminar,” Ellery explained. “He has become someone I go to chat about life with, which is great.”
Evelyn Wong ’21, a Neuroscience concentrator from the West Coast, said she felt “extreme shock and an immense feeling of gratitude” when she woke up Monday morning to a congratulatory email from Phi Beta Kappa.
“I never expected to be in this pool of people because conversations like this don’t usually revolve around first-generation, low-income students,” Wong said. “It was so unexpected.”
Wong added that she did not think she was eligible for academic honors like Phi Beta Kappa, since she did not discover these programs until the end of her sophomore year.
“There are many people that can come into Harvard and know what a path is and know what PBK is,” Wong said. “Then there’s first-generation, low-income students who don’t always know what’s going on. Before junior year, I didn’t even think I would be able to get something like this.”
Though Wong said she recognizes Phi Beta Kappa as a “huge academic achievement,” she said the feat is also a credit to those who helped her throughout the years.
“When I got the letter, it felt as if it should have been a personal academic achievement, but I’m really lucky to have had all the mentors I’ve had throughout my undergraduate experience,” Wong said. “It definitely does not feel like a personal achievement because there are so many people that supported my academic career.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Monday that Harvard would resume teaching and research in the fall, undergraduates met the news with a flurry of questions about their future.
As the coronavirus pandemic progresses, students have speculated for weeks about whether they would be able to return to Cambridge in the fall. Some Harvard affiliates — including parents and incoming freshmen — have penned open letters to administrators, urging Harvard to delay its fall semester rather than continue remote instruction if the coronavirus pandemic precludes in-person classes.
Garber’s email put to rest the possibility of a delayed start but left much else uncertain. He wrote that administrators are still considering many options for the fall.
Some students reacted to Monday’s news with relief. Tomasz Cienkowski ’22 said he worried that, if the College were to delay the semester and he returned home to Poland, he would be barred from returning to campus due to a temporary ban on the entry of European foreign nationals into the United States.
“I’m not sure if I would gamble on going home just because I don’t know whether the ban would be lifted by the time I come back,” Cienkowski said. “[Delaying the semester] works great for people who live in this country and have the rights to freely move across the country, but it doesn’t work as well for international students should the immigration restrictions remain in place.”
Others, however, said they were disappointed by the news. Nancy Hu ’22 said she would rather forego most of winter break than take fall classes remotely.
Sadaf T. Khan ’22 — who also supports a delayed start — said he felt Garber’s email “brushed over” the reason why the University was no longer entertaining the possibility of a postponed fall semester.
“Basically, it said that we’re having classes upcoming semester no matter what. And they didn’t give us sufficient reason as to why they took that other option off the table. So I would have preferred — or I would have appreciated — if the provost laid out the reasoning,” he said.
Asked about student criticisms, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment beyond Garber’s email.
Some students said Garber’s email resurfaced challenges students initially faced when they headed home mid-semester — concerns about inequality, grading, international travel, and extracurriculars among them.
A full semester of remote instruction would present challenges for first-generation, low-income students even greater than the ones they faced this spring, Jordan H. Barton ’23 said.
“How are they going to accommodate FGLI students, especially that come from unstable homes and that had a hard time transitioning home in the first place?” he said. “How are they going to be expected not just to go through with finishing classes, but selecting classes, advising, picking concentrations, especially people that will be going into their sophomore year? And how will we receive services, especially for things like Internet?”
Cienkowski questioned whether Harvard would modify grading for the fall semester if courses were to continue online. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences adopted a universal Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory grading system this semester to account for challenges wrought by the coronavirus pandemic after weeks of student debate.
“The idea behind SAT-UNSAT this semester was that they said, since students have such vastly unequal access to resources and to a good learning environment, we can’t grade them on a letter basis,” he said. “But if classes continue online, nothing changes.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates that FAS plans to decide no later than July whether the College’s residential campus will reopen for the fall semester.
Several students said they appreciated the advance notice as they aim to book travel and make plans for the fall. In March, students had just five days to plan their exit from Cambridge; now, they will likely have months to plan a potential return.
“For international students, every single flight is so expensive. Every single move that you make is a huge financial burden on your parents’ part,” said Yejin Kim ’22, an international student from South Korea.
But even if they can make plans with adequate notice, some international students said they are skeptical of the merits of virtual learning.
Kim said if the fall term were to occur remotely, she would consider taking a semester off to avoid online courses and seek an internship near her home in South Korea, where the severity of the pandemic has begun to wane.
Daniel J. Forrest ’23 — an international student from Australia — specifically cited time zone differences as a drawback of online courses. He added that he and several other Australian students even considered petitioning the College to allow international students to participate in a “study abroad” program at home.
Cienkowski, Kim, and Forrest all questioned how the University would accommodate students who would elect to take a leave of absence the fall semester if it were to occur online.
“It seems to me that if 80 percent of students take a leave of absence in the fall, let’s say, and then the freshmen also come in, and then all these people want to come back to campus in the spring, there may not be enough space for them,” Cienkowski said.
Aside from academic concerns, several students cited other parts of their college experience that a partially or fully online semester will change.
Kevin T. Stephen ’20 — the manager of the Harvard Krokodiloes, a campus acapella group — said he is grateful for the added “clarity” the administration has given in recent messages. Still, he said the fall presents challenges for performing arts groups like his.
“If we’re not on campus in the fall, there’s no telling if we’ll even have a group. Auditions might not be possible, rehearsals might not be possible,” he said. “Even if we are at school, on campus, there’s no telling if concerts, gigs, performances will still be happening as they were in previous years.”
As the entire world awaits more information about the state of the pandemic in the coming months, Benjamin J. Dreier ’22 said he understands the University’s challenging position in deciding its path forward for the upcoming academic year.
“There’s a lot of speculation that’s happening. And there’s a lot of people making plans, but no one really knows what’s going to happen,” Dreier said. “The only decision maker right now is the virus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan spoke about the pandemic-stricken economy, the future of the Republican party, and U.S.-China relations to a digital audience at an Institute of Politics Fast Forum Monday.
The Fast Forums are a shorter virtual continuation of JFK Jr. Forums — formerly hour-long conversations with elected officials, political operatives, journalists, and activists.
Public leadership professor and former president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur C. Brooks co-hosted the forum with Ryan, who currently teaches at the University of Notre Dame and is an AEI fellow.
With the United States stock market crashing amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Ryan said he is “frankly very, very worried about the economy.”
“Deflationary spiral has been my biggest concern, which is a liquidity crisis becomes a solvency crisis. And then thousands and thousands of businesses go bankrupt,” he added.
In terms of a federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, he said he hopes states can start reopening on a “case-by-case” basis following the implementation of increased antibody testing.
“It is not a good time for limited-government conservatives. No two ways about it,” he said, regarding the importance of the federal response.
Reflecting on the political landscape more broadly, Ryan also said he doesn’t know what the future of the Republican Party in the post-Trump era will hold.
“There’s going to be a big fight for the soul of the conservative movement in the post-Trump era,” he said. “It’s either going to happen in one year or in five years time. There’s going to be a huge soul-searching after the president leaves as to what is the future of conservatism.”
“And it’s going to be along these different populist lines — Reagan conservatism, classical liberal conservatism, paleocons, reformicons,” he added.
Ryan said he is worried about the political polarization in the country, citing different responses to opening up the country.
“I visited the government of Oklahoma yesterday,” he said, adding that he thought “most of Oklahoma can open.”
“They have — I think — 504 cases in the entire state,” he said. In fact, Oklahoma has confirmed more than 3,200 cases of coronavirus as of Monday evening.
Ryan also said differences in infection rates and experiences with the pandemic form the basis for discrepancies in attitudes toward relaxing social distancing guidelines between more Republican rural areas and Democratic urban cities.
He added that he predicts “major realignments” in U.S.-China relations as a result of the crisis.
“We have to do a better job of repatriating the supply chain so we do not have to be so dependent on others,” he said. “I’m a pretty free trade guy, but the one exception to that is China, because China was not playing by the rules.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College will launch a scholarship application for Harvard Summer School courses, the College announced Tuesday morning.
The scholarship program will allow a number of undergraduates to take subsidized courses over the summer for credit. The selection process will prioritize students whose studies have been adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, as well as those who need the courses to fulfill Harvard College’s graduation requirements.
The College has also earmarked a limited number of need-based scholarships for students on financial aid.
A committee comprising members of the Office of Undergraduate Education, Dean of Students Office, Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, Harvard Summer School, and the Financial Aid Office will review the applications. The College, rather than the financial aid office, provided the scholarship funding.
The application asks students to submit the summer school courses they hope to take, their reasons for enrolling in these courses, and their concentration or intended concentration. The application further requests approval from a resident dean or adviser.
Harvard Summer School Dean Sandra A. Naddaff ’75 wrote in an April 13 email that the program would hold its 2020 session online due to the COVID-19 pandemic
The announcement followed an email from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to the undergraduates, which informed students that the College’s 2020 summer programming would move to a virtual format. Spring term courses across the University transitioned online in mid-March after Harvard mandated students vacate campus to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
In a typical year, the summer school welcomes around 9,000 students to Harvard’s campus for courses at both the collegiate and high school levels. It also administers Harvard’s undergraduate study abroad programs, which the University canceled in late March due to the pandemic.

Dear All-Pre-Frosh-Trying-To-Decide-On-Schools-Without-Visiting-Any-Schools,
First of all, you’re doing amazing sweetie. The hardest part of applying to college is over, and you’ll never have to write another 250 word essay about how you possess “intellectual vitality.” That is not to say that deciding a college isn’t difficult, but you definitely have the resources to help you through the process. Just because you can’t make an on-campus visit doesn’t mean you can’t accomplish what you hoped to during the visit. Many financial aid offices have virtual hours and you could always call in. If you already developed a specific academic interest and were planning to visit that department, get in touch with a professor to see if you can sit in on a class or access a virtual tour of the department’s facilities. If you just wanted to see what walking around the campus is like, try using Google street view.
Wanted to get a sense of student social life and activities? Most extracurriculars have their own websites that are accessible through the main campus page. You can usually contact them directly on their site to ask any questions or to speak to a member. Also, depending on the type of extracurricular, you can scour the Internet for past videos of their concerts, performances, articles, games, or stock pitches. As for social life, there are plenty of student vloggers who have shared their experiences. And if finding the closest Trader Joe’s to campus happens to be what’s most important to you, this is also information you can acquire online. Plus, many universities are having their pre-frosh visiting programs over the Internet. Harvard, especially, is doing an outstanding job with recreating the on-campus experience through Virtual Visitas. So many people have put an incredible amount of work and effort into making it a valuable resource. Special events being held for prospective students include ones hosted by certain extracurriculars, departments, student panels, professor webinars, and even a CS50 puzzle day. Virtual Visitas can really help you consider Harvard in a fair light — because let’s be honest, no one actually commits to Harvard because of the in-person experience of eating a Veritaffle.
The main takeaway from an on-campus visit is the school’s vibe, and vibe is just a vague way to say people. After all, if you ask any alumni what their favorite part of college was, 99.9 percent of the time their response will be “the people” (yes, the same answer your interviewer likely gave you). To get a sense of what the people at a college are like, reach out to potential classmates. Join that Facebook group or GroupMe and see if these are the people you want to spend the next four years with. Current students are also more than happy to answer any questions you have, so go ahead and DM a few people! Make sure to get more than one person’s perspective; if the first person you talk to has a negative response, it might be because they’re stressing over finals. Still, many can give you an inside scoop and great reasons to attend — beyond the generic ones from College Confidential. Another solid way of meeting the student body is by listening to a more collective voice. Most universities have student publications and their own versions of The Crimson/Flyby Blog. Reading student pieces will help you get a sense of what student life is like, what matters to the people on that campus, and what they appreciate the most.
Still stressed? I decided between schools by flipping a coin. Before you roll your eyes and wonder how I got into Harvard, I did it because I knew that if the outcome was disappointing, I would simply choose the other school. It worked out pretty well for me; narrowing down a list to two schools usually isn’t that difficult, but deciding between those two (unless it’s between Havard and Yale) is often the true struggle. Grab a coin and try it out! If this doesn’t work for you and both sides of the coin look equally good, then the truth is both offers are amazing and you’ll find happiness at either school. Worst comes to worst, you can always take a gap year on your couch.
We hope to see you in the fall, Class of 2024!
Sincerely,
Myself and everyone in Flyby

One of the most important things my parents said to me during the college process was, “We want you to go where you will be happy.” This notion has stuck with me ever since, and meant a lot as someone who got into Harvard Early Action (humble brag?), but wasn’t sure that it was where I wanted to go. I ended up applying to another 10-plus schools on the regular decision timeline, which probably seemed crazy to my peers, because my parents never made me feel like just because I’d gotten in somewhere, I had to go there. I ended up choosing Harvard after going to a very rainy and cold Visitas and, despite feeling like a half-drowned cat the entire time, having so much fun that I knew it was the place for me.
I want to recognize the amount of privilege I had in being able to make a decision like that, and to even apply to as many schools as I did. I know that this is not everyone’s experience. I have helped a few of my younger friends from high school in their college processes, and would like to share what considerations I think are important to take into account when choosing your home for the next four years (not in any order of importance).
I would suggest writing out answers to the following questions, and then formulating a pro and con list with the information you find in your answers. These, plus your gut feeling, should help you make your decision.
1. Academics: What made you excited to apply in the first place? What are the drawbacks?
A. Yes, maybe the ranking matters to some extent, but do they have the kinds of majors/programs/professors you’re looking for? If you’re really interested in a niche aspect of biology, can your research and interests be supported at this institution? If not, is that something you’re willing to compromise?
B. What do the requirements look like? Are you going to receive AP/IB credit? Is there enough flexibility for what you’re looking for? Is there enough structure? How easy is it to shift between schools, if you start out in a Business program but decide you’d do better in Arts and Sciences? Do you see yourself having the space in your schedule to explore what interests you
C. What kind of cycle is the school on? Semester, quarter, or work-study?
2. Location: Will you love living there?
A. I always joke that I don’t know why I went to school in the Northeast when I hate the cold and want to always be in the sunshine. Does climate matter to you? Seasonal Affective Disorder is real and can be a struggle for a lot of students. Will you thrive somewhere that’s got extreme temperatures?
B. Are you choosing between a school like Harvard in the U.S. versus internationally? What are the benefits and drawbacks of each university, and would it matter what country you went to school in for your future career?
C. Do you like hustle and bustle, or are you someone who likes their own space/nature? The thing that really drew me to Harvard was that it has its own campus, but is also right in Cambridge with easy access to Boston. I knew I wouldn’t do well somewhere in the middle of nowhere, but that is not true for everyone. You’re going to be living there for four years. In what kind of place do you want to live?
3. Community: Do you see yourself blending well with the people who already go to school there?
A. Lots of people don’t get the opportunity to visit every school they apply to/to which they are accepted, and this could make answering this question difficult. Try to find students whose job it is to talk about the school with prospective students and see if you vibe with any of them. Ask them about their experiences making friends/finding the people who make their campus feel like home. Also try to find students through friends or from high school that go there and ask them for their takes!
B. How many people is too many people? Size matters. Are you comfortable in classes with hundreds of people? Do you like the idea of living with ten thousand (or more) other young adults? Or are you searching for a smaller community from the start? Somewhere in the middle? How will the number of people who attend this school impact your access to resources you will need and finding people you love?
C. Look into their extracurriculars! If you love to do creative writing, are there opportunities for you to do that at this institution? Can you try to walk onto the track team? Thinking about what matters to you outside of academics and seeing if that school has those things is essential.
D. How cutthroat is the school you’re looking at? Is that an environment in which you would thrive? Is the school’s reputation worse than its reality?
4. Resources: Can this school support you academically and as a human?
A. What are their Financial Aid resources? Did you earn scholarship money for this school? Does the school have scholarships to which you can still apply? Would you have to take out loans? How does the university take care of its FGLI students?
B. What are the resources for students of color? Immigrants? Students with disabilities? LGBTQ+ students? What kind of insurance does the school offer? Will you have access to mental health resources? How a university treats every member of its community is important. Look into these questions and let them play a factor in making your decision.
C. Can this school help you find internship opportunities/make connections for the future?
And finally: Does thinking about going here make you feel excited? Happy? The answer to this question should hopefully be “yes.”
I joke (to my parents’ horror) that college in many ways is summer camp with classes. Is this entirely accurate? No. There are jobs and stresses and responsibilities and the real world looming. But I like to think that in the most fun moments, college should feel that way. It should be a place that truly “sparks joy” — maybe not all the time, but enough that it’s worth the times that it doesn’t.
We hope these questions were helpful! We hope you find a place that makes you feel at home the way Harvard does for us, and that Harvard is that place for you.

We know that navigating Visitas, and even Harvard in general if you choose to come here down the line, can be daunting and confusing, especially now that everything is virtual. With that, Flyby presents words of advice about Virtual Visitas from some of Harvard’s very own faculty and students.
“My advice for admitted students is to interact with as many current students as possible. There are many ways to do this, including a number of student panels including the Diversity Peer Educators and Office of BGLTQ + student interns. Over 50 student organizations are organizing guest speakers, webinars, or other events to give students a glimpse of the breadth and depth of activity on campus. While we know that nothing can replace being on campus and seeing the energy within the remarkable student community, our students are eager to show the Class of 2024 what makes Harvard such a special place.”
— Katherine G. O’Dair, Dean of Students
“I can't imagine how challenging it is to try to choose a college without visiting. I know the main reason I chose Harvard was because of the time I spent on campus during Visitas. That being said, I think there are virtual ways to determine if it's the school for you. A lot of clubs and student orgs, my own included, have been putting a lot of info, photos, and testimonials on social media under #visitas2020, so I would recommend scrolling though that to see what kinds of clubs look fun. I would also recommend looking at all the digital resources Harvard has put out. Go through the online catalogue of the rare books at Houghton! Take a virtual tour of campus! Ask a current student what their favorite part of Harvard is! The most challenging thing about virtual visitas is you really have to put a lot in to get anything out, but I think it will still be a rewarding experience.”

“A few weeks ago, right before the lockdown, I was in the Boston Amtrak station waiting for my train to New York and decided to get a latte (chai, to be specific). Just when I was walking off, the barista dropped a gem on me: "Where there is chaos, there's an opportunity." That has sat with me since, so I now share it with incoming students. As they prepare for the first-year fall at Harvard, I would encourage all students, but particularly my beloved FGLI community, to find the opportunity within what might seem like chaos. The game has changed. The terrain is different. While there is much to be mourned in this shift, there's also a great deal to gain. How can students leverage this moment? One way to do so is to leverage the open-access to Harvard they now have before even stepping foot on campus. Many Harvard entities (including my office, the Academic Resource Center) are flinging the doors wide open for virtual connections, beginning with Visitas and continuing into the summer. Virtual open doors offer the opportunity to get to know Harvard at a slower pace than is required in the fall! Unprecedented access, unprecedented opportunity! Leverage it! My second point is Harvard is a marathon, not a sprint: engage, but don't try to do everything this summer. Rest, restore, recharge, and get ready for the amazing journey that's about to begin!”
— Sade Abraham, ARC Academic Coach
“One way that prospective students can find out more about the libraries at Harvard is through some virtual Harvard Library Live sessions for prospective students this month. There are a few more sessions still to come, and admitted students should be able to see the details on the Admitted Students Virtual Visitas website. This session covers basics about what Harvard Library offers to students, and it also goes into some details about the First-Year Librarian Program, where first-year students are matched with a librarian for the academic year, to help them navigate the library services and spaces. Students can think of First-Year Librarians as their personal connection to HL, and they should feel comfortable asking their librarian any question, from simple to complex, as they arise throughout the year.”
— Anna C. Assogba and Molly McInerney, HFAS Research Librarians
“I suppose the only thing I would add would be to say to students don’t worry about messing this process up. That doesn’t mean students won’t feel at times that there are things they would have done differently if they had full knowledge going in, but that ‘full knowledge’ isn’t really possible when entering a totally new environment. My advice for the summer: try to enjoy learning about Harvard. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to understand everything — you’ll learn so much through experience!”
— Margaret C. Rennix, ARC Academic Coach
