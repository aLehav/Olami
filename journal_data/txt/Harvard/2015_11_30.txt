After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Counterintuitively, it’s the militant quality of the recent wave of activism across college campuses that has kept me from taking it too seriously. It’s the megaphones, the coordinated outfits, the phones gyrating through the air to capture incisive chants on Snapchat stories—all of which betray that maybe these protests are less the means and more the end. Related to the movement's militancy is its flamboyance. These protestors’ brand of activism intends to primarily express and invoke solidarity, and to that end, it chooses spectacle over substance. On Facebook this month, I was invited to not one, but two “solidarity photoshoots.” I’m still unsure of what that means.
But what happens when we get rid of this militancy, this flamboyance? What happens when we replace the high-strung, passionate atmosphere of the campus protest with the sober, more intellectually demanding lecture hall? Far scarier than any campus protest was my experience in class last week, when in light of the grievances of these student protestors, we discussed the limits that should be placed on disagreeable speech on campuses. We asked ourselves in all seriousness a question that, despite the irony, I believe is too dangerous to even entertain: When is censorship okay?
We’ve been asking that question a lot across campuses as of late, as, strangely, student activists seem to think the solution to their having been silenced for far too long others is silencing others. At Yale, it’s silencing leaders who dare make their residential communities intellectual spaces as opposed to homes—as if these functions are mutually exclusive or one is more important than the other. At Princeton, it’s silencing history—the self-indulgent belief that erasing the name of Woodrow Wilson on a program would also erase the racism of his time, that sanitizing history is somehow a healthier alternative to acknowledging the most harrowing realities of the past. Really, it’s this incongruence between the grievances of these student protestors (many of which are valid, I think) and these non-sequitur demands that bothers me the most.
If we dive into the diction of this new student activism—diction that some of the most vocal supporters of free speech restrictions used in my class ad nauseam last week—we may see some, albeit poor, rationalization of their demands. Disagreeable speech is no longer “offensive”; rather, it’s “hostile." It is no longer a violation of good taste, but a prima facie violation of the victim’s personhood and liberty. A student in my class claimed that repeated microaggressions pose a quantifiable threat to their victims’ lives, equal in severity to physical violence itself. This reframing of an argument about decorum to a patently false, histrionic one about something far more critical is how these calls for censorship may actually gain some traction.
To be fair, despite the smack of elitism, their argument that it’s the duty of the enlightened to silence disagreeable opinions is tempting. At the very least, it entices the platonic monarchist that I know is within all of us. But the implications of censorship, even in as trivial of a context as student life, bleeds into areas of higher learning and beyond that do carry import. Why couldn’t a public retraction of Yale housemaster Erika Christakis’ email be used to justify banning a debate on abortion because that environment could be “hostile” to victims of sexual assault? Why couldn’t the removal of Wilson’s name from Princeton serve as precedent for removing the names of comparably racist JFK from Harvard or founding fathers from our national ethos? Even though safe-space syndrome has only infected campus life so far, leaving the curriculum aside for now, what if the unruly id of the student activist finds a new prey? After all, why teach anti-Semite Marx, homophobe Dante, and especially that slavery-loving Aristotle in classrooms that are increasingly Jewish, gay, and black? To invoke your grade-school teacher, the slippery slope is very real.
More deadly than what the restriction of free speech on college campuses can lead to is the abandonment of the very purpose of higher education as soon as the first person says, “You can’t say that.” We come to college to engage in inquiry—to pursue veritas—not to mindlessly accept the empty verdicts of our peers to whom we wish not to be "hostile." This necessitates contrarianism, even if only to deliberately entertain the possibility that the premises that everyone seem to subscribe to may be wrong.  For what it’s worth, Christakis’ email pushing back against popular opinion on cultural appropriation was not only crucial for its substance, but for its function in promoting critical thought by asking the question, “What if you’re wrong?” She merely entreated students to question their premises, not abandon them all together.
I predict that this strange new power dynamic emerging on college campuses, where students leverage mostly reasonable grievances for patently unreasonable ends, will weaken the university as the last remaining bastion of free speech—at risk of culturally appropriating a word from the activist community, the last remaining “safe space.” Unlike the office, the church, and even the Thanksgiving table, as last week’s episode of SNL pointed out, the campus has not been a place where we fear getting silenced. I pray it stays that way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed and want to escape the concrete box I call my room, I stop working and cross the street to Weeks Bridge.
The cool breeze is refreshing. The vast open space above the Charles provides a sense of clarity. I am on a bridge. I can choose to wander or to stay in that exact spot. Either way, the river beneath me will continue to chug along. Standing in the middle of that bridge, I realize that I am afraid of failure.
It is something I have always been afraid of, something that will probably always haunt me.
What can I do better?
Will this be enough?
Am I enough?
I recall Jay Gatsby. I remember how I do not want my ambition to consume me. There is a fine line that I sometimes do not know where to draw. I want the green light of desire and hope to guide me, but not to be the only source leading me in my tunnel of darkness.
At Harvard it is easy to compare, easy to see everyone’s strengths. It is easy to fill up time with your strengths. It can be easy to hide weaknesses, to come off as nearly flawless. We want to be the floating ducks peacefully drifting down the river, though underneath the surface, our little webbed feet are kicking hard, just to control ourselves from the strong water currents. In my two main circles of friends, I am close enough to look past the groups of feathers and webbed feet to actually see how they travel down the river.
Like a set of rowers on the Charles, the first is determined, focused, and serious. They do not go out on the weekends, rather, they stay in and study. They want the flawless transcript. They see the shining GPA as the set of oars to propel them to the med or law school of their dreams. Row after row, they do not dare lift their heads and risk distraction; they are always working towards their set finish line. They have an internal coxswain screaming out orders; they define themselves by their tasks and constantly remind themselves of their desired end points. Sitting in their boat, I cannot keep up with their rhythm. I feel too much like a machine when I define myself by test scores and grades on papers or p-sets to get where I want to be. I still want to lift up my head and see the world passing by me as I move along.
The second tends to float like fresh fall leaves on a pool of water. They let the currents take them, making adjustments only when they have to. Their movements do not define them; they do what pleases them at every moment. Ruled by passion and bliss, they take things one wave at a time. It’s the thrill of the spiraling downfall, the whirl of excitement that pleases them and distracts them from the unknown. They surround themselves with others so they do not have to travel through this part of the journey alone. Their heads are almost always up looking towards the shore rather than back to predict where they are going.
I cannot be a leaf. I am too afraid of water splashing over me and causing to me to sink. My arms and mind get tired too easily to be a rower. Maybe that’s why I do not want to be in a river at all but rather farther down in the open ocean. In the ocean, there still are currents, but there are more directions to travel. On my surfboard, I can choose which waves to catch. The breaks in-between each set allow me to catch my breath, to let me lift my head and see the horizon beyond me. I can see the green light from the lighthouse, but can chose which waves to ride to guide me there. Catching a wave only to fall off and tumble beneath the sea reminds me that I am alive, that I am breathing and awake. I know I can learn from my failures and that risk is necessary for reward. I can balance my heavy head. I can rest my tired arms.
But I am not in the ocean. I am on a bridge in the middle of the Charles River. The bridge is my break, clarity, and viewpoint beyond the tunnel vision normally seen closer down along the river or inside my room. My friends are more than a sets of rowers and piles of fall leaves. I turn my head and look back towards Cowperthwaite Street and start to walk back. I am coming. I will not fight the current but will do my best to not let it overtake me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past three weeks, a troubling trend has emerged among Republican presidential candidates. In the wake of the heartbreaking terrorist attacks on Paris, even moderate contenders for the GOP nomination have overreacted in their haste to score partisan political points at the expense of the Constitution and interfaith understanding. As ever, we should take care not to allow our horror and fear at terrorism turn to hatred and discrimination. Conflating ISIS and Islam is easy, but it is also wrong. Islamophobic views have no place in our national discourse.
Yet sadly, these views are precisely what we see from too many candidates. Donald Trump has made an escalating series of offensive remarks, first in favor of government surveillance of mosques, then in support of a database and special ID card for Muslims. We find these ideas entirely objectionable. They fundamentally infringe upon our foundational right to worship freely, instead singling out a religious minority for special and unfair treatment. These measures go beyond bad policy: They run counter to American values and our way of life.
Just as troubling as his Islamophobia is Mr. Trump’s seeming lack of original views. Presidential candidates should be running because they have ideas and a vision for this country. Instead, Donald Trump makes the news by agreeing to an absurd series of hypothetical questions from reporters. For a man constantly touting his ability and willingness to stand up to Vladimir Putin and ISIS, Trump's failure to stand up to probing questions from a Yahoo News reporter is striking.
Unfortunately, Mr. Trump is not alone in his Islamophobia. Ohio Governor John Kasich recently called for the government to set up a new agency to promote “Judeo-Christian values.” Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush argued that the Obama Administration should screen Syrian refugees via a religious test—under his plan, only Christians would be permitted to come to the United States. These views may not be quite as reprehensible as Mr. Trump’s, but they are just as un-American. They run counter to our nation's belief, grounded in its Constitution, in the basic human right to practice any religion or none at all.
When even mainstream and moderate candidates espouse these views, it is a sad day for the Republican Party. It is also a sad day for our country, where millions stand behind the thoughtlessness and intolerance. Just as the road to the White House should be trod by people better than these, as citizens of the United States we should also be better—responding with respect for all faiths, and rejecting the candidates who refuse to meet that bar.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates would be required to fulfill distribution requirements, complete a quantitative-based course, and take fewer general education courses in new, consolidated categories as part of a drastically altered General Education program, should members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences vote  to approve a new proposal in the coming months. 
On Tuesday, members of the committee tasked with reviewing the College’s General Education program—previously deemed “failing on a variety of fronts”— will present their final report and “major proposals” for the program following more than 18 months of review. Faculty will discuss the proposal at Tuesday’s meeting—the last of the semester—and likely vote on the proposal, which The Crimson independently obtained, in the spring semester.
The final report outlines a three-pronged vision of the new program. If adopted, students would take four Gen Ed courses from new subgroups different than the existing categories, a departmental course in each of the three divisions of FAS, and an Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning or other quantitative departmental course.
The proposal—which will be presented to the Faculty by Philosophy professor and committee chair Sean D. Kelly—gives no indication as to what undergraduate class could first graduate under the new Gen Ed program.
In order to ensure that the program is implemented successfully, review committee members also recommend that professors be offered financial support for teaching in the program, and that Gen Ed course section sizes should be capped at 14 students with a target of 12. A “good General Education Program will require financial support from the Administration and buy-in from the Departments,” the committee wrote.
Last May, the review committee issued an interim report outlining a series of administrative and structural faults manifest in the existing program, including the unwieldy section size of many Gen Ed courses and the sheer number of courses that count for Gen Ed credit. Perhaps most notably, committee members wrote that program currently has no place in the College’s identity.
These “major proposals” for the new program greatly diverge from the current system, which has been in place since 2009 and requires students to take courses in eight different Gen Ed categories. Ultimately, committee members wrote, they hope to mix three existing Gen Ed aims: to prepare students for “a life of civic and ethical engagement”; to have students learn about a “range of disciplines”; and to allow students to be flexible in their schedules and take courses they are interested in.
THE NEW GEN ED
Under the new program, students would be required to take a breadth of distribution courses across FAS divisions—the natural sciences or SEAS, social sciences, and arts and humanities—and four Gen Ed-specific courses, a mixing of two models that committee members have deemed vital to a student’s undergraduate experience.
In their preliminary report released last spring, committee members wrote that in its current iteration, the Gen Ed program is a “chimera: it has the head of a Gen Ed requirement with the body of a distribution requirement.” In meetings over the past semester, faculty members on the whole disapproved of solely requiring students to take courses distributed across divisions.
The proposed program aims to be different than simply a set of distribution requirements. Faculty and administrators would create new Gen Ed courses for the program—of which Gen Ed courses deemed “successful” in the current program could be a part—and those courses would be separated into a set of four “broadly divisional” tags. These new categories include: “Individuals, Societies, Histories"; “Science and Technology in Society"; ”Aesthetics, Culture, Interpretation"; and “Ethics and Civics.”
Three tags are designed to align “roughly” with the three divisions of FAS, and the fourth, “Ethics and Civics,” would be based off the current Ethical Reasoning category. According to the report, committee members also combined existing categories when creating these new tags: “Aesthetics, Culture, Interpretation” combines the current Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding and Culture and Belief requirements; “Individuals, Societies, Histories” combines Societies of the World and United States in the World; and “Science and Technology in Society” combines Science of the Living Systems and Science of the Physical Universe.
A course can fall under a maximum of two tags, but, just as under the current program, a student can only count each course for one of the four Gen Ed requirements. Ultimately, the courses would all “aim to prepare students for a life of civic and ethical engagement with a changing world,” according to the proposal.
Departmental, or “back of the book,” courses would not count for the Gen Ed Course requirement. Instead, students would also be required to take three “distribution courses” across the FAS divisions of Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences. Courses in a student’s concentration would not count for this requirement, according to the report. Courses from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences could count for the Natural Sciences requirement.
Under the new program, the current EMR Gen Ed requirement would become its own, separate quantitative requirement and take on a similar structure to the current expository writing and foreign language requirements. A faculty committee would craft courses specifically designed for the EMR category, but courses from departments such as Mathematics and Statistics could also fulfill the requirement. The proposal says courses satisfying EMR “would be available at levels appropriate for students with varied quantitative backgrounds.”
AN ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE
In an effort to alleviate the various resource constraints that have plagued Gen Ed, the proposal for the reformed program offers a series of recommendations to improve implementation and administration, stating that a “good” Gen Ed program will require “financial support” from administrators and “buy-in” from departments.
Notably, the proposal suggests that sections in Gen Ed courses should have a maximum of 14 students and a recommended size of 12, which aligns with demands from a graduate student-led campaign begun to decrease section sizes and lessen teaching burdens of teaching fellows. The campaign has received endorsements from many FAS affiliates, including 11 departments, the Graduate Student Council, the Undergraduate Council, and numerous committees and individual faculty members.
The proposal also outlines specific support and incentives for TFs, including training programs, supplemental pay for teaching in the Gen Ed program, and performance awards. Some TFs they feel overworked and stressed from the large pressures on them, and faculty members have acknowledged using Gen Ed courses to hire TFs from their departments.
Further, committee members suggest placing significant resources for technical support, course development, and administration. They also suggest creating a “pedagogical community” for faculty members and teaching fellows teaching in the program.
The proposal concludes by noting the need for departments’ commitment to Gen Ed, stating that searches for faculty positions should “take into account needs of Gen Ed.” The proposal also states that administrators should offer incentives for departments to offer courses in Gen Ed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that Jill Stein ’72-’73 ran for President of the United States, she was arrested at a national debate.
While fellow Harvard graduates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama took to the stage, Green Party candidate Stein was barred from the forum. When she showed up anyway, she was removed from the site and handcuffed to a chair at a nearby police facility for hours, well after the crowds and press had left.
Now in the thrust of her second campaign for Commander-in-Chief, Stein faces an uphill battle against the two mainstream parties. But with the same activist mindset that she was introduced to as an undergraduate at Harvard, along with a steadfast belief in her political principles, and an absolute willingness to be arrested again, she has far from given up hope in her ability to make a difference.
AN ACTIVIST’S EDUCATION
While she is known today for marching outside of coal plants and protesting in foreclosed homes, many of Stein’s first encounters with activism took place in Harvard Yard.
As an undergraduate during the Vietnam War and Harvard College’s first move toward co-ed housing, Stein’s college career was marked by significant social movements that swept over the student body.
During Stein’s freshman year, she witnessed the historic 1969 Harvard student strike, when students stormed and occupied Massachusetts Hall to protest the University’s relationship with the military until police officers forcibly removed them.
It “was a historic time…for the University, for women, for the peace movement and the social justice movement,” Stein said, noting that the Vietnam War “was a very powerful engine for social engagement.”
Concentrating in Social Relations—a combined major of anthropology, sociology and psychology—Stein credits Harvard for introducing her to “a level of dialogue that was very elevated and compelling.”
“It really required you to figure things out and take a stand,” Stein said. “I learned how to write at Harvard and learned to analyze things.”
After graduating with her second Harvard degree from the Medical School in 1979, she began noticing many of her patients’ ailments seemed rooted in environmental pollution.
Stein moved from participating in activist movements to organizing them after she developed a passion for environmental health activism while working at a health clinic, finding a niche she never discovered at Harvard.
Gaining prominence in that field, Stein’s first introduction to organized politics came when the Green Party recruited her to run for Governor of Massachusetts in the 2002 election.
“[The Green Party] said ‘just do what you’re doing. Continue fighting power plants and incinerators. Continue advocating for healthy jobs that are good for workers, the community and the planet in the form of recycling and green energy. Do that, but call it a political campaign,’” Stein said.
“So I said, ‘nothing else is working, might as well try politics.’”
THE GREEN CANDIDATE
As her political career developed, Stein’s stance on issues has come to be synonymous with the Green Party as a whole—left-wing with an environmental focus.
The center of her Presidential platform is a Green New Deal, her plan to revitalize the economy and environment by providing jobs in the sustainable energy sector.
With the goal of reaching full employment by providing a job to every American who wants one, Stein hopes to replicate key aspects of the New Deal legislation of U.S. (and also Harvard Crimson) President Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1903.
“It revives the economy, creates well paying living wage jobs that we desperately need at the same time that it greens the economy and the energy system and therefore turns the tide on climate change and makes wars for oil obsolete,” Stein said. “It’s a win-win.”
Stein expects that if implemented, the Green New Deal would allow the US to become fully dependent on renewable energy within 15 years.
She also takes a liberal stance on domestic policy, saying her positions are mostly identical to those of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.
Stein takes Sanders's platform one step further, she said, when it comes to education, not only planning on making all public colleges free but erasing all existing student debt.
“Forty million young people are indentured servants without much hope of getting out of debt,” she said. “We have a generation of hopeless young people who cannot get their way out of debt, who don’t have jobs, and who are watching the climate collapse.”
Stein championed the cause at a Million Student March rally at Northeastern University in November, where recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate Eduardo I. Vargas said he would “absolutely” vote for Stein in the general election. “I understand that she stands for the right things,” he said. No Green Party supporters at Harvard could be reached for comment for this article.
Although also an outspoken supporter of civil rights and major criminal justice reforms, perhaps Stein’s biggest policy difference with Sanders is her stance on the Democratic party.
“In many ways, Democrats are especially dangerous when they support a corporate agenda,” she said. “Because they are the lesser evil, progressives are talked out of opposing them, talked out of fighting for living wages, or to stop the [Trans-Pacific Partnership], or to stop the expanding wars.”
The Green Party does not accept any corporate contributions, raising most of its money online from grassroots supporters. But with coffers dwarfed by those of her fellow candidates, that donation policy takes its toll.
VALOR IN LOSING
Stein is the most successful female candidate ever to run in a Presidential general election, yet with only 0.36 percent of the vote in 2012 her chances of governing from the Oval Office have been, and continue to be, bleak. As the presumptive candidate from the Green Party, Stein’s presidential campaign faces many obstacles before she can gain the prominence enjoyed by her Democratic and Republican challengers.
“Most people don’t know that small parties exist because they are purposefully suppressed by the Democratic and Republican parties because they actually do represent the ideals and the values of the broader American public,” Stein said.
Although Government professor Ryan D. Enos agreed that third parties are disadvantaged by the structure of the electoral system, he seriously doubted that the mainstream parties actively colluded against the Greens.
Green Party candidates are often barred from debates, struggle to raise funds, and sometimes left off state ballots, forcing them to gather signatures in some states just to get candidates' names on the ballot.
But even among those voters who agree with her stance, Stein faces significant roadblocks.
Government lecturer Colin M. Brown said that if voters want to elect someone who shares their ideals, a vote for the Green party is “basically going to be wasted” until it becomes more powerful.
“That doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t vote for them if that’s a useful expression,” he said. “It does allow a different voice in the debate, but not a very loud one and not one that’s likely to take office.”
Other liberal voters remain hesitant to vote for third party candidates because of the “spoiler effect,” worried that by not voting for a Democratic candidate, a Republican would more likely win.
“The spoiler effect is the latest propaganda campaign to keep people locked into an abusive political system,” Stein said. “This point of view is basically the politics of fear, which tells you you can’t vote for what you want, you have to vote against what you fear.”
Despite having lost two gubernatorial races, a state house election, and a previous Presidential run, Stein still has hope for success, believing that now is her time.
“There is an occasion where a third party actually won a presidential election coming into it at as a third party. And that was a time of extreme social upheaval, like what we’re in right now,” Stein said. “His name was Abraham Lincoln.”
Stein hopes that the excitement around Bernie Sander’s progressive campaign will benefit her in the general election, hoping that if he loses the Democratic primary, his supporters will flock to her.
“We will be the Plan B for Bernie,” she said.
Still, Government professors say she has no serious chance of winning.
“I’m not holding my breath [for victory]. On the other hand I’m not ruling it out. I’m losing inside of a losing system and that is an act of valor in and of itself,” Stein said. “At the end of the day, it’s not about whether we win today or tomorrow. We have to redefine what winning is in a rigged political system.”

The holiday season kicked into gear at The Charles Hotel on Saturday when hundreds of attendees gathered in the hotel’s plaza to enjoy live renditions of classic holiday jingles and to watch the hotel's annual tree lighting extravaganza.
The evening featured performances by Santa Claus’s Jazz Band, a photo opportunity with Santa, and a tree decorating event, as well as free cookies and hot chocolate from local eateries Henrietta’s Table and Shake Shack.
“It’s a great event for the kids to come out and listen to the music and see Santa Claus,” attendee Nicole Boucher said.
The Charles Hotel’s general manager, Alex Attia, said the event has been an annual tradition at the hotel for more than 20 years.
Attendees were also asked to bring new gloves, hats, and baby coats to be donated to Cradles to Crayons, an organization that helps low-income children in the Boston and Philadelphia areas with which the hotel has partnered before, according to hotel spokesperson Ariana Ducas.
The Harvard Square Business Association helped publicize the event, according to HSBA executive director Denise A. Jillson.
“The Charles Hotel is a longtime treasured member of the Harvard Square Business Association,” Jillson said. “The Harvard Square Business Association [was] absolutely delighted to help promote this event that really kicks off Sparklefest, which is Harvard Square’s month-long celebration of the holidays.”
Cambridge resident Kathy Yoon said she has attended the event with her children Tyler and Jane for several years now. When asked what he thought of the event, Tyler Yoon loudly said “Santa’s great!” as he eagerly waited in line for hot chocolate.
Jessica Su, another local resident, said she decided to attend the event after seeing an advertisement.
“We’re having a great time,” Su said. “My daughter is loving the cookies and hot chocolate. She thinks it’s the best thing that she has ever had!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the heels of an incident of racially-charged vandalism on campus, Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow has appointed a committee to reconsider the school’s controversial seal—the crest of the former slaveholding Royall family that endowed Harvard’s first law professorship in the 19th century.
The school’s seal, which features three sheaves of wheat under an emblem of “Veritas,” came under scrutiny earlier this year when a group of students, calling themselves “Royall Must Fall,” demanded its removal in light of its connection to slavery.
Now, it seems their activism is bearing fruit. In an email last Wednesday, Minow told Law School affiliates that she had appointed a committee to “lead research into, and a community discussion, of whether to continue using the HLS shield.”
The creation of the committee comes as Law School students have questioned how racially inclusive the campus is. About two weeks ago, Law students and faculty arrived at the school to find pieces of black tape placed across the portraits of black Law professors. Students and observers were quick to condemn the incident as racist vandalism, and as of last week, Harvard police were investigating the incident as a hate crime.
The incident prompted some Law School students to raise broader concerns about what they described as a sometimes unwelcoming environment there; Minow herself said racism was a “serious problem” at school. Specifically, several students called on Law School administrators to do more for minority students, and one common demand was for them to reconsider use of the seal.
In addition to naming the committee, Minow’s email outlined several “concrete efforts” she said the school will take to make the Law School more inclusive and diverse, including diversifying the faculty and setting aside more time during first-year orientation to “tackle sensitive issues openly but with mutual respect.”  She referenced the vandalism incident in her email.
Law professor Bruce H. Mann will serve as the chair of the committee, according to Minow’s email. Mann will be joined by Law professors Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Annette Gordon-Reed, Janet E. Halley, and Samuel Moyn, according to Michelle Deakin, a Law School spokesperson. Two students and an alumnus will also serve on the committee, and administrators will share further details at a meeting open to school affiliates on Monday, according to Deakin.
Halley, a member of the committee and Harvard’s Royall Professor of Law, said Minow asked her to serve on the committee over the weekend. She said she will go into the committee with an open mind.
“I’m open to considering all the options. I don’t have a strong feeling about the shield itself,” Halley said. “The shield itself is different from the portrait, the chair, although those issues may come up.”
Rena Karefa-Johnson, a third-year Law School student, said she was optimistic about the creation of the committee. A co-founder of Students for Inclusion, a Law student advocacy group, Johnson described it as encouraging to see the school take concrete steps for potential change.
“I think it’s going to continue to be a negotiation and there seems to be at least some level of willingness on the part of the administration to negotiate,” she said. “And I think that’s a good thing.”
Mawuse Vormawor, a member of Royall Must Fall, declined to comment for this story.

A Facebook page purporting to represent a “union” of white Harvard students surfaced on the social media platform last week, prompting outrage among students who denounced it as racist and an investigation into its origin from University administrators.
The page, which is not endorsed by Harvard, includes a description claiming that the group was formed to “defend the inherent rights of White Europeans” and links to the website of the American Renaissance—a group listed as a White Nationalist extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Several “White Student Union” pages referencing other colleges also cropped up on the social media site last week, seemingly in response to recent debates about diversity on college campuses and the experiences of minority students there. Many of those other pages appear to be fraudulent and were removed in some cases after universities made complaints.
Whether any Harvard students or affiliates are responsible for the Harvard page remains unclear. In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane affirmed that “it remains unclear who is behind the creation of the unauthorized accounts” but indicated that administrators are “closely monitoring the situation.” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana notified Harvard’s Office of General Counsel about the page, according to Dane, and the office is investigating.
The administrator of the page has posted photographs that purport to show posters advertising the group displayed around Harvard’s campus. A Crimson reporter located a poster referencing a “White Student Union” on stands near Canaday Hall in Harvard Yard on Sunday evening, but was unable to verify the identity of the creator of the Facebook page.
Responding to Facebook messages from a Crimson reporter on Sunday, the page’s administrator repeatedly refused to share his or her identity, citing security concerns, but claimed to be a Harvard student. The person behind the Facebook page also declined the reporter’s request to meet on campus or at The Crimson’s offices for an interview.
The Facebook page surfaced online as questions about race and diversity at Harvard have come to the forefront of campus dialogue. More than a week ago, an incident at Harvard Law School involving pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black faculty members prompted a police investigation; just days earlier, Harvard students took part in a march in support of black students responding to allegations of racism at other colleges across the country. A Harvard College working group also recently released a report calling for widespread reforms to better accommodate minority students.
Several students who saw the Facebook page over Thanksgiving break reacted with both dismay and confusion.
“My reaction was less shocked and more disappointed,” Brianna Suslovic ’16 said. “It sort of felt inevitable because these types of groups have appeared on other campuses.”
While Suslovic said she thinks the page may be associated with Harvard students, Michael F. Musharbash ’16 said he thinks the page is likely a hoax, but still troubling.
When he first visited the page, Musharbash said he thought it was “ridiculous.”
“I came to the page and I thought there was no way this is a real Harvard student,” he said. Musharbash described images that the page has posted as troubling, and he said he hopes it is removed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

WORCESTER, Mass.—It was déjà vu for the Harvard men’s basketball team (2-4) on Sunday against Holy Cross (3-3). In a game that eerily resembled last season’s contest between the intrastate rivals, it was the Crusaders who came away with a one-point victory for the second year in a row, this time, 50-49.
“Obviously, they have changed over and we have a turnover in personnel and it is different,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We certainly want to play a game with more pace and higher scoring and point total, but we had opportunities.”
Junior guard Anthony Thompson made a pair of free throws to put Holy Cross up four with 36 seconds to go. Looking to cut the lead to one, Crimson senior reserve forward Patrick Steeves came up short on a three-pointer. Junior forward Zena Edosomwan corralled the rebound, found point guard Tommy McCarthy, and the freshman connected on a three with eight seconds to go.
Knowing that Harvard needed to foul, Crusaders junior guard Robert Champion launched the ball the length of the court, allowing the clock to run out on the Crimson’s frantic comeback attempt. Harvard’s inability to score inside, poor free throw shooting, and turnovers ultimately proved to be the difference in what was supposed to set the tone for contests against Northeastern (5-1) and No. 5 Kansas (4-1), both tournament teams from last season, later this week.
After falling behind 9-0 to start the game, strong defense and contributions from the bench propelled the Crimson to a two-point halftime edge. Steeves, playing in just his third collegiate contest, checked in along with junior guard Corbin Miller, sophomore forward Chris Egi, and freshman forward Weisner Perez seconds before the game’s first media timeout.
The group sparked Harvard to a 13-6 run and helped hold Holy Cross to just 12 points in the final 17:02 of the first half.
“I thought our kids off the bench really gave us a shot in the arm and gave us an opportunity to make it a game and kind of saved us at the beginning,” Amaker said.
Despite the brief lead, the Crimson played from behind for almost the entire second half. The slow start to the game for Harvard repeated itself following the intermission. With the Crusaders double teaming Edosomwan, the Crimson struggled to score inside.
The team had just 20 points in the paint and only went to the free throw eight times. To make matters worse, Harvard, which is shooting 58 percent from the line this season, only converted three of those attempts.
“We didn’t do a good job finishing today,” Edosomwan said. “That’s on me and I didn’t do a good job finishing for us tonight and I am disappointed in myself. As bigs, we pride ourselves on finishing down low but chippies, in and outs, we just did not finish them.”
Freshman Corey Johnson, the Crimson’s top spot-up shooter, picked up his fourth foul with 10:25 left in the contest and his absence helped Holy Cross grow its lead to five before he returned for the game’s home stretch. The lead reached 10 with 5:26 left.
“It hurt,” Amaker said. “Corey was in foul trouble and we were going offense-defense as much as we could. The lack of timeouts, trying to use timeouts earlier in the game to stem the tide and see if we could hold on at certain times. It certainly didn’t help us to have Corey on the bench, especially on the offensive end.”
The eight and ten-point Crusader leads might as well have been 20 the way the second half began offensively for Harvard. The Crimson scored just 12 points in the first 14:43 following halftime. However, much like in last year’s contest, Harvard managed to have a shot at the end.
With the game on the line, the Crimson received contributions from McCarthy, who had been held scoreless before nailing a key three pointer and converting on a heavily contested layup in the game’s final minutes, and Johnson, who made his only three-pointer of the afternoon to cut the deficit to three with 2:03 to play.
Harvard’s best shot pick up the victory may have come with 1:02 left, trailing by two. Edosomwan could not handle a Steeves pass and, just like a season ago, Holy Cross sent the Crimson back to Cambridge with a loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, MASS.—As the clock expired on a 50-49 Holy Cross victory, its second consecutive one-point win over the Harvard men’s basketball team (2-4), the Hart Center was a scene of pure jubilation.
Junior Robert Champion, whose three with 2:45 to go put Harvard in a six-point hole from which it never recovered, was lifted up in the air by his teammates, violently pumping both fists. Senior Anthony Thompson, who hit more free throws in the second half than the Crimson did in the game, beat his chest with one palm, gesturing to the crowd with the other. The official Holy Cross (3-3) social media account was effusive, tweeting “TWO STRAIGHT OVER HARVARD!!”
The reaction, fit for a program-defining upset, highlighted the disparity Sunday between perception and performance.
The Crimson, the de facto heavyweight of the region that dominated state foes to the tune of a 21-3 record over the last five seasons, fell to 1-3 against Massachusetts competition, with its sole win against a Division III squad. A team that had not finished outside the top 100 in Ken Pomeroy’s rankings since 2010 found itself 181st Sunday afternoon.
The culprit, once again, was the Harvard offense. The Crimson shot just 37 percent and committed 14 turnovers, misfiring on three-quarters of its three-point attempts and scoring just 12 points in the first 12 minutes of the second half.
“I guess the overall word for me … disappointed comes to mind,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
HELP OFF THE PINE
The Crimson started the game sluggish, falling behind 9-0 in less than three minutes as the Crusaders hit their first four shots. The interior defense, a bright spot for the Crimson through four games, was slow to react twice on backdoor cuts as Bill Carmody’s squad hit layups on four consecutive possessions.
Barking at his troops, Amaker immediately looked for a spark off the bench. The ensuing lineup—senior Patrick Steeves, junior Corbin Miller, sophomore Chris Egi, and freshmen Corey Johnson and Weisner Perez—immediately went on an 8-3 run to bring Harvard back into the game.
“I thought our kids off the bench really gave us a short in the arm and gave us an opportunity to make it a game,” Amaker said.
Steeves, who played a career-high 26 minutes, was a fixture down the stretch for the Crimson. The senior led the team in both rebounds (12) and assists (seven), adding two threes.
The versatile forward played three for Harvard down the stretch in big lineups with classmate Evan Cummins and junior Zena Edosomwan, providing the Crimson with more spacing and passing at the position than starter Agunwa Okolie. He twice found Edosomwan with lob entry passes for dunks, a play later the Crimson went back to trailing by two with 55 seconds left. This time, however, Edosomwan fumbled the ball out of bounds, costing Harvard its best shot at a tie.
“He gives us a lot,” Edosomwan said. “He’s great defensively, can shoot the ball, [and] is a good passer.”
Steeves, who did not see the floor during his first three years on campus while battling knee injuries, was playing in just his third game ever for the Crimson.
“Honestly, understanding how hard he has worked to get to where is after not playing for almost three years … it’s beautiful to see him on the court,” Edosomwan said.
STRUGGLES AT THE LINE
Looking at the box score after the game, both Amaker and Edosomwan fixated on one number—free throw shooting. While the junior was more shocked to hear the team had shot just eight times from the line, converting three, both were equally direct.
“We are not getting there and when we get there, we are not converting,” the coach said.
“I don’t know what to say … Usually we try to pride ourselves on getting to the line,” his player said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eight months after leaving Minnesota as national runner-ups last season, Crimson coach Katey Stone and the No. 8/8 Harvard women’s ice hockey team returned to the North Star state this weekend to take on No. -/10 Minnesota-Duluth in a pair of nonconference tilts.
In a matchup that saw the Crimson square off against several former Harvard personnel behind the Bulldog bench, UMD head coach Maura Crowell included, Harvard (8-2-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) split the two decisions at AMSOIL Arena, dropping the first game, 4-2, before skating away with an authoritative 4-1 victory over the Bulldogs (6-10-0, 3-7-0 WCHA) in the encore.
HARVARD 4, UMD 1
After suffering its first loss since Oct. 23 on Friday, the Crimson bounced back to rout the Bulldogs, 4-1, on Saturday. Four different players found the back of the net in a contest Harvard led wire-to-wire.
“We put more pressure on them,” Crimson co-captain Michelle Picard said. “We gave them less time to make plays with the puck and were just more aware on the ice, a little bit more on our toes, [and] made more plays.”
Rookie forward Audrey Warner got the scoring started eight minutes into the game, poking a shot in front of the crease past UMD freshman goalkeeper Maddie Rooney.
Harvard doubled its lead just before the end of the first frame, as senior forward Miye D’Oench scored the 100th point of her collegiate career.
After struggling to control possession of the puck inside the left faceoff circle with two Bulldog skaters on her heels, the senior pivoted towards the edge of the circle before firing a laser past Rooney.
Freshman forward Grace Zarzecki extended the Crimson lead in the second period, as the rookie found the back of the net after sophomore forward Karly Heffernan fed the puck around the boards to senior forward Mary Parker, who dished to Zarzecki for the goal.
UMD attempted to get back into the game but remained unable to penetrate the Harvard defense until five minutes into the third stanza. Junior forward Lara Stalder found the back off the net following a faceoff to get one back for the Bulldogs.
Junior forward Sydney Daniels put the finishing touches on the Crimson victory, sending a rocket into the top left corner of the net from the slot, the fifth goal of the season for the forward.
After conceding four goals the night before, the defense played a pivotal part in the Harvard victory, killing all four of the Bulldogs’ power plays. Co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer contributed 30 saves for the Crimson—her third straight game with at least that many—and picked up her fourth victory of the season.
“[UMD] had plenty of good chances,” Stone said. “The best penalty killer is the goalkeeper, and [Maschmeyer] played great. [She] was very big in those situations and we played well in front of her.”
UMD 4, HARVARD 2 
With the score even at two goals each, an errant puck found itself at the feet of UMD junior Ashley Brykaliuk. The forward sniped the puck from the high slot for her second goal of the contest, giving the Bulldogs a lead they would not relinquish en route to a 4-2 victory over the Crimson.
“We weren’t attacking the way we usually do,” Picard said. “For whatever reason, we were sitting back a little bit and giving them more time and space than we should’ve.”
UMD got off to a quick start, as Brykaliuk fired a shot just 31 seconds into the game that bounced off of Maschmeyer’s right pad and into the goal.
The momentum shifted between the teams for the majority of the first stanza, before the Crimson obtained a 5-on-3 advantage following two penalties against the Bulldogs.
Despite failing to take advantage of the two-skater advantage, Parker found the back of the net during the 5-on-4, as senior forward Jessica Harvey’s shot from the left faceoff circle bounced off of Rooney, allowing Parker to poke the puck in.
The Crimson once again took advantage of a 5-on-3 power play in the second stanza, as D’Oench slapped in a shot from close range after a rip from Mastel at the point deflected into the path of the New York native, giving Harvard its first lead of the game.
The lead was short lived, however, as Bulldog senior forward Michela Cava evened the score on a one-on-one opportunity just three minutes later before Brykaliuk’s second score put UMD in front.
A power-play goal from sophomore defender Catherine Daoust finished off the night for the Bulldogs, who earned their second straight win over a ranked team with the victory.
Maschmeyer posted a season-high 33 saves for the Crimson, but the defense surrendered more than two goals for the first time since its 4-1 loss to top-ranked Minnesota in the 2015 national championship.
With Harvard missing two players in Daniels and sophomore forward Lexie Laing on Friday, the team struggled to play cohesively within its rotations, making it hard for the Crimson to instill its game plan.
“We were on our heels right from the start,” Stone said. “Missing a couple of kids in the lineup made us struggle with lines a little…. Our rhythm wasn’t there with the line changes we made. Defensively we struggled, we didn’t support our defensemen, it just wasn’t a real team game for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s basketball team faced off against Rice was 28 years ago. Almost three decades later on Saturday night, the outcome was the same: Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith came away with another win, this time in her 34th season at the helm.
Facing a winless Rice squad (0-5), the women’s basketball team came away with a close victory in Houston on Saturday night, 67-61. For the second game in a row, the Crimson (4-2) sealed the win at the free throw line. Scoring their last eight at the charity stripe, Harvard pulled away despite two late threes from the Owls.
“We started the fourth quarter real strong,” Delaney-Smith said. “I was very proud at the team’s reaction and response at the swing of momentum and our toughness to get it back.
“We played a great fourth quarter, and we were able to hang on at the end regardless of the calls and regardless of the swings of the game,” she added. “We just hung tough, particularly on the defensive end.”
The Crimson outshot Rice 25-16 in the fourth quarter with 11 of co-captain AnnMarie Healy’s 13 coming in the last 10 minutes of the game. After a third quarter in which Harvard ceded 22 points on .500 shooting from the Owls, the Crimson entered the final frame trailing by three after it had led by as much as 12.
In a game that featured four lead changes and long runs from both teams, Harvard rallied when it mattered most. After a 14-2 run from Rice late in the third, the Crimson bounced back with a huge fourth quarter. Despite being double-teamed for much of the match, the trio of seniors—Healy, Shilpa Tummala, and Kit Metoyer—went off for 17 in the game’s final 10 minutes as Harvard pulled away late for the win.
“Basketball is a game of runs, and it’s just really responding to them that makes a good team,” Healy said. “I think that as we develop as a team this year we’re going to just become more consistent throughout each quarter and each half and each game.”
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead in the first quarter, shooting lights out from beyond the arc and getting easy buckets inside. Harvard took a quick 20-12 lead after the first 10 minutes, but in the second frame, both teams struggled to score.
Despite out-rebounding the Owls and turning the ball over less, the Crimson could not seem to put the ball in the basket in the second quarter. After shooting 3-for-3 from beyond the arc in the first quarter, Harvard missed all five attempts from deep in the second quarter.
“We did take an early lead, and then they changed—Rice decided to come at us with a lot of pressure,” Delaney-Smith said. “They were double teaming, they jumped passing lanes, and they just upped the pressure on us, which caused us to get back on our heels a little bit and took away our ability to execute some of our offensive sets.”
Despite a difficult second quarter that saw the Crimson shoot 4-for-15 from the field, Harvard ended the half with a seven-point lead, 30-27.  Despite being outscored by 10 in the third, the Crimson rallied to start the fourth quarter on a 13-2 run before closing out the win at the free throw line.
The points at the free throw line would be imperative, as the Crimson went 15 of 21 from the line, while Rice missed some crucial free throws, going 8-for-20 at the charity stripe.
“Everything really came together,” Healy said. “I think that as a team it really came down to getting more defensive rebounds, boxing out, and being slow and controlled on offense.”
Saturday’s game marked the first time this season that four of Harvard’s players scored in double-digits.
With the victory, the Crimson has extended its winning streak to three games. Harvard has three more games prior to winter break.

In case you haven't been outside recently, you may not have noticed that the temperatures have stayed remarkably high given the time of year. To commemorate the important occasion, Flyby wrote an ode of thanks:
O sweat stains in my t-shirts, why are you still appearing?
When the leaves began to fall, it was rather deceiving;
I though the weather would turn, and a chill would set in,
But much to my surprise the cold did not begin.
I awoke every morning beginning October 1st
Looking at my phone, waiting to be cursed
With temperatures low, and wind chills high
But much to my delight, it was warm, with no sign of why.
When the rakes were staked abreast in the yard,
I prepared my winter clothes and put up my guard.
My midterms came and went, and there was still no snow.
The grass was raked and green, and my confusion continued to grow.
I came to Cambridge thinking Mother Nature was an ice queen,
But up until recently this weather has been a dream.
Everything was great until the heat turned on in my dorm;
The unbelievably dry heat left me wishing for a snowstorm.
As the temperature slowly drops, and winter begins to show its face,
I will forget my woes from the warm weather, at an increasingly rapid pace.
When the snow begins to stick, and the icicles begin to form,
