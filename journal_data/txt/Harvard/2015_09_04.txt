After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For my undergraduate degree, I had the privilege of studying in a “Great Books” program at Concordia University’s Liberal Arts College in Montreal. This bachelor of the arts degree in “western society and culture” is one of over a hundred Great Books curricula in North America, Europe, and Asia. The Concordia program was modeled on the Great Books movement, which began at Columbia University in the 1920s and now constitutes that university’s Core Curriculum. The Western version of a Great Books course of study was itself inspired by the medieval and Renaissance educational ideal of a liberal arts education, believed to be crucial to producing a well-rounded person who had the moral and intellectual preparation for social and political life.
During my undergraduate degree, I did not fully appreciate the education that I was receiving. It was only when I began to teach full-time as a lecturer in the Social Studies program at Harvard University, that I recognized the value of the books I had studied. One thing that I have learned from teaching at different institutions is that all students, and not only students, need models by which they can individually and collectively reflect on ethical questions, social and political issues, and the quest for knowledge—in all its various forms—that links all of us across geography and history.
Beginning in the 1980s, Great Books programs came under criticism from feminists, anti-racists, and postmodernists. The Western canon was interpreted by many as simply a collection of works by “dead white males.” This assessment was understandable: Women and people historically descended from Asia, Africa, and Latin America were right to call for courses that provided them with insight into their contributions to Western and global history and culture. Many of the critiques, however, were not only focused on the books chosen but were also informed by postmodernist questioning of the very idea of “Great Books”—interpreted as just one more power-laden meta-narrative. While the reflection on the canon was timely, it was also short-sighted. These scholars and activists forgot that students need historical points of support, thinkers who have been interrogated for hundreds and even thousands of years, with which—and against which—they might formulate their own innovative interpretations.
I am a believer in the importance of Great Books, but how does one teach them in a globalized world characterized, at its best, by an aspiration to respect cultural, ethnic, gender, and sexual differences? This past summer I taught a Harvard Summer School course that I recently designed titled “Big Ideas, Great Thinkers” that focused on philosophers of antiquity, not only from the West, but from around the world. Students received the opportunity to learn not only about Plato, Aristotle and Sappho, but also Confucius, Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, the Mahabharata, and the Buddha. And I taught these thinkers from a perspective informed by numerous critiques. For example, we investigated how the texts construct and sometimes deconstruct gender roles and identities. The goal was to provide my culturally diverse classroom with the first semester of a global canon.
In the ideal world—or at least at Harvard College—every student would first receive a “global Great Books” education before proceeding onwards. Students should be provided with the critical and creative thinking skills, developed through an encounter with some of the most influential minds in history, to help them deepen their ability to investigate the challenges and privileges of our era, while remaining informed by an understanding of our shared past.

Last month, Senator Edward J. Markey accompanied President Obama on his visit to Kenya and Ethiopia—two countries that have suffered acutely from the AIDS epidemic for decades. Kenya, in fact, still faces the fourth largest HIV epidemic in the world today. But despite Markey’s proximity to the President and his role on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, the Democrat from Massachusetts has failed to take an active role in reversing the steady flat-lining of global AIDS funding since 2011.
The waning U.S. political will to fund the fight against AIDS is particularly devastating because it comes at a moment when medicine and science ambitiously point towards ending the pandemic once and for all. Unlike during the onset of AIDS in the 1990s, today patients in developing countries like Kenya can access affordable treatment thanks to effective generics.
These advances paved the way to achieve an incredible milestone this month as the U.N. goal of placing 15 million people in poor countries on anti-AIDS medicine was achieved. Moreover, groundbreaking research has finally ended the “treatment versus prevention” dichotomy that long characterized discourse around AIDS by showing that placing people on treatment also reduces new infections by 99 percent. We now know unequivocally that treating people is the most effective prevention.
These advances have convinced experts in the field, like Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health, that we can end AIDS within the decade using the tools and knowledge now readily available to us—if we restore the pace.
As the tide of the epidemic is finally turning, the Obama administration disappointingly continues its attempts to cut global AIDS funding—an amount already confined to only a small fraction of one percent of the federal budget. Last year, for the first time ever, this funding gap translated to steep declines in the number of new patients who could be enrolled on life-saving treatment, as well as declines in other core prevention interventions.
If we are to end AIDS in the next 10 years, scientific consensus points to expanding access to treatment for all people living with HIV—not allowing waiting lines of patients to grow longer. At this crucial juncture, our politicians must remain steadfastly committed to providing resources through mechanisms like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) rather than turning their backs on poor patients and families in need of life-saving treatments.
As the funding crisis grows more serious, Markey stands uniquely positioned to help. The state of Massachusetts has long proven its role as a leader in public health—from the invaluable data collected in the Framingham Heart Study over three generations to instating state health care reform nearly five years before the Affordable Care Act made the same principles of insurance coverage a national standard.
As undergraduates who have volunteered in health clinics and as medical students walking through the threshold of patient rooms both in the U.S. and in front-line countries abroad, we are constantly reminded that every life matters, from South Boston to South Africa. Senator Markey can put us back on track to end one of the deadliest diseases of our time by advocating to restore the $300 million in deadly cuts made to PEPFAR since 2011 in the upcoming budget negotiations. The contributions America makes to the global fight against AIDS set a precedent that determines how aggressively other donor countries’ investments will be, rendering our commitment critical to the international agenda.
At a time of unprecedented optimism and scientific progress, we urge our senator to make a public stand for fully funding a commitment to an AIDS-free generation.

Harvard College’s new honor code, implemented this year in conjunction with the new Honor Council, is intended to foster a common culture of academic honesty at the College. The full text of the code was rolled out as part of the registration process prior to the commencement of this semester: Each student was required to electronically sign a statement affirming their awareness of the honor code in order to register for enrollment.
Early in the planning process, we praised the makeup of the Honor Council and the idea of an honor code. We continue to support the concept of having an honor code at the College and understand its importance in creating a cultural shift toward academic integrity. But this code is not the right one.
Over the past few years, the need for improvements in the academic culture of the College has become clear. The Gov 1310 cheating scandal was striking in its size and reach, but the evidence suggests that it was hardly an isolated incident: Multiple Crimson senior surveys have reported startling numbers of graduating students who have cheated during their four years at the College. Harvard has a problem, and an honor code could go some way toward fixing it.
The current honor code, however, fails to establish a clear moral vision. Its ultimate appeal is not to ethical values or a sense of pride in one’s work, but a violation of “the standards of our community" and of "the wider world of learning and affairs." Yet the code does not explain what these standards are, or why they exist—and administrators who have promoted it in speeches haven't explained that either.
Neither the text of the code nor the messaging around it has stressed the real meaning of honesty or integrity, the importance of taking pride in one's own work and respecting the work of others, or the satisfaction of making meaningful contributions to the classroom and College. The honor code misses an opportunity to hold up these principles, which Harvard students relate to far more closely than they do to the mere existence of "standards" or "rules."
Introducing an honor code provides one avenue to a wider culture of academic honesty at the College. But the code in its present form neither appeals sufficiently to principles of honor and ethics, nor clearly codifies what is and is not acceptable. An honor code is far more powerful when it describes a well-defined moral vision and helps students understand why that vision should be important to them. If Harvard really wants to change its culture, it's going to need to change its wording, too.

Though an expository writing class has been a feature of every Harvard undergraduate’s education since the program’s introduction in 1872, a new policy will allow students who qualify for placement in Expository Writing 20 to enroll in Humanities 10a and 10b instead.
At the introductory meeting for Humanities 10a: “A Humanities Colloquium” on Thursday, more than 150 freshmen filled the seats and aisles of Fong Auditorium in Boylston Hall. Several students shopping the course—a year-long, interdisciplinary introduction to Western cultural works ranging from Homer’s "Odyssey" to James Joyce’s "Ulysses"—said the new Expos credit policy has made the course more appealing. 
“Getting Expos credit did influence my decision [to shop the class],” Hanna M. Glissendorf ’19 said. “It was definitely a perk.”
Another freshman, Liana M. Henderson-Semel ’19, said she prefers the broader focus of the Humanities 10 course to the more specific topics covered in Expos 20 classes.
“I felt like [Humanities 10] offered a lot more than Expos in terms of literature and history,” she said.
Humanities 10 was reintroduced last year. The course has since undergone substantial restructuring to incorporate many of the elements of the usual Expos 20 curriculum, according to Humanities 10 teaching faculty.
Because enrollment in Humanities 10 will be based on a selective application process, only 75 freshmen will be able to take advantage of the new option. In her opening speech to the packed lecture hall, Philosophy professor Alison Simmons, one of the head teaching faculty for the course, cautioned against taking it solely as an alternative to Expos 20.
“If this is a course that you think would be an interesting way to fulfill the Expos requirement, this is not the course for you,” she said. “It really needs to be your top-priority class.”
Simmons and Amanda J. Claybaugh, another course head, said they have collaborated with the Harvard College Writing Program to strengthen the writing instruction in the class.
“The faculty have met with [the Writing Center] to talk about what their goals are, and we have all of their literature on goals and strategies,” Simmons said. “We have a preceptor who’s part of our teaching team, who’s coming to all of our meetings and helping us design assignments and think through the one-on-one meetings with students to talk about their writing.”
According to Simmons and the course’s head teaching fellow, Lauren Kopajtic, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris first proposed the idea of working with the Expos program. Harris will also lecture in Humanities 10a this fall.
“It was a faculty-level discussion, and Dean Harris in particular was instrumental in working with the other faculty to make this happen,” Kopajtic said.
For her part, Simmons said the new emphasis on writing will render the course more valuable to potential humanities concentrators.
“[Claybaugh and I] both feel that writing in the humanities is part of thinking,” she said. “You can’t think in the humanities without doing some writing, because it’s all an integrated activity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 4, 2015, at 5:51 p.m.
Omni, a smartphone application that aims to eventually replace the current “Harvard” app, was launched to undergraduates via a College-wide email from Undergraduate Council leaders and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Thursday.
The application is part of a two-pronged package from the Council. Omni, which is Latin for “all,” consolidates similar features from the old application, including a dining hall menu and shuttle tracking services. 
In an interview last semester, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 said the app would only include tools that she called “relevant to the daily life of an undergrad.” Omni requires students to answer a verification message from their official College email address to access the application.
Development on the app began last semester by Hugo Yen ’18, Leverett House UC representative, Jason F. Herrmann ’18, and Lori LoTurco, College director for communications strategy. Yen also worked to develop “Club In,” another smartphone tool which helped students register for email updates from student groups during Visitas, Harvard’s official visiting weekend for accepted students.
Work on Omni continued over the summer and involved heavy collaboration between College administrators and UC representatives, according to Council Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16. Yen added that individuals from Harvard University Information Technology, Computer Science 50, and Harvard University Dining Services also helped with portions of the app’s development.
According to Goyal, the application launched to the Class of 2019 prior to the official launch. Downloads of “Ventfull,” a calendar application brought to Harvard last spring, have also increased since the introduction of Omni, he added.

CORRECTION: September 4, 2015, at 5:52 p.m. 
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Omni application did not include information about financial aid and libraries. In fact, the application does include this information.

Although some affected employees say they are cautiously optimistic about new changes to Harvard's health benefit offerings, the chair of the body that recommended the changes said he is “worried” that Harvard faculty and staff might have difficulty navigating the numerous health plan options.
“People wanted more choice, but the problem with more choice is it makes the choice process more complicated,” University Benefits Committee chair Michael E. Chernew said, later adding that “the real test is going to be around open enrollment.”
“[I am] worried about how comfortable Harvard faculty and staff feel making the choices among this ever growing array of health plans,” Chernew said.
After criticism and heated debate about last year’s health benefits package, the University adopted a new policy for 2016 that includes an additional plan option without deductibles or coinsurance but higher premium for in-network care, though key information like premium costs and reimbursements have not been announced. 
Non-union faculty and staff members sounded off after Harvard controversially restructured its health benefits policy for 2015, introducing for the first time an out-of-pocket deductible and coinsurance. Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and administrators maintained that the rising cost of health care necessitated the cost-cutting measures, but their reasoning did not resonate with members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who unanimously passed a motion asking University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation to reverse the policy.
A new Point of Service plan will be offered alongside last year’s option, although more specific details about the new package have not yet been released.
The plans are subject to additional changes instituted this year, including no coinsurance on diagnostic tests, upwardly adjusted salary tiers, increased copayment costs for office visits from $20 to $30, and a reimbursement plan for low-wage workers.
Some faculty members said they do not yet have enough information about the new plan but appreciate that the administration appeared to take their concerns into account when crafting it.
History professor Alison Frank Johnson, a vocal critic of the 2015 plan changes who also co-authored an op-ed with 10 other professors criticizing the changes, said she is “reserving judgement” until final details of the plan are announced. She noted, however, that the new plan “has the potential” to alleviate some of the issues she and other faculty members raised last fall.
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, who also co-authored the op-ed, wrote in an email that he appreciates that “there has been movement away from some of the more regressive aspects of the 2015 plan,” specifically citing the removal of coinsurance and deductibles for diagnostics and x-ray work.
However, he wrote that he would like to have seen more adjustment on the plan’s salary tiers, which were raised in an effort to support lower salaried employees.
In his email to affected employees detailing the new policy changes, Garber said they were inspired by the feedback from faculty and staff members, including town hall meetings and information sessions held by the UBC.
Chernew, whose committee recommended aspects of the new plan to Garber, said the change is partly a result of town hall meetings the committee held in the spring and other feedback they received from staff and faculty. He added that the committee revises Harvard’s health benefits policies each year, regardless of feedback from benefits enrollees.
“It’s not like we weren't planning to do anything and all of the sudden we did something,” Chernew said. “That said, it was the case that the overall community reaction influenced our thinking heavily.”

Twenty-five freshmen taught by 14 instructors will undertake an intensive, year-long study of the life sciences this fall in Life Sciences 50, a new course that has now been implemented after more than a year of planning.
The course, which will serve as the academic equivalent of four individual courses, incorporates biology, chemistry, math, computing, and physics into a life sciences curriculum of more than 120 lectures, meeting for 90 minutes each weekday.
“This is the class that I wish I’d had as an undergraduate,” said Andrew W. Murray, a professor of molecular genetics, adding that LS50 aims to bridge the perceived boundaries separating the various sciences to provide a comprehensive introduction to the life sciences.
“One of the things that I think is unfortunate about science education in the United States is the tendency to regard different disciplines as being entirely separate from each other, which makes it difficult for students and scientists to make connections between them,” he said.
Along with lectures, the course includes six hours of lab each week, where students can conduct original research. According to Mary E. Wahl, a College fellow in the department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, students will be able to contribute to current projects supervised by two Bauer fellows, funded researchers at Harvard.
“[The Bauer fellows] designed a component for this course that is suitable to be done by many hands with methods that they think are pretty certain to work,” Wahl said. “They’re letting students jump in on these projects and get new results for the first time.”
Students cited the appeal of research experience and an exceptionally small class size as reasons to apply to the course.
“The fact that it’s such a small class with so many faculty members [is] a really good experience, especially as a freshman,” Caroline R. Desjardins-Park ’19 said. “If I were in a big class, I’d probably be scared to go talk to the teacher. I’d probably just talk to my TF.”
Following an introductory email sent out to the freshman class, 125 students applied for 25 spots in the course, according to Wahl. Students were first selected based on their math placement scores, then entered into a random lottery. Wahl said course instructors will compare the final performances of students who took LS50 and peers who took the traditional LS1a and LS1b course series to evaluate the efficacy of the new course, as applicants who do not make it into the course are likely to enroll in LS1a and LS1b.
LS50 will demand more than 14 hours a week in class time alone. Murray said the challenge of the course for both its instructors and students will be “combining the joy of discovery and the excitement of learning with the level of work that’s required.”

Students at the College faced an additional obstacle when they shopped for fall courses this week: a new course catalog search tool that students characterized as visually appealing but confusing and unintuitive. 
The new search interface, part of the reworked my.harvard portal, comes as administrators roll out a new centralized student information system and was released in preview mode in mid-July, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke. On the new platform, students can filter courses based on criteria including class meeting time, whether they fulfill General Education requirements, concentration, and cross-registration availability. It also links course listings directly to course websites, the Q Guide, Google Maps and Harvard Maps (for meeting locations), and the Coop (for course textbooks).
But despite those bells and whistles, some students had trouble navigating the tool when they arguably needed it most—shopping week.
“I just couldn’t figure out the user interface—it wasn’t completely intuitive,” said Ronia S. Hurwitz ’18, who also disliked that the new interface lacks the capacity to display courses on a calendar based on meeting times. “It’s difficult to see all courses—that I wasn’t thrilled with—and it’s difficult to see the location or changes that have happened recently.”
For some students, the initial trouble understanding the new tool was compounded by the fact that the change at first rendered courses.cs50.net, a popular external and student-made course browsing tool, more or less useless. The service was not updated to reflect new course information until Aug. 29, and even now, it lacks class meeting locations, meaning students essentially had to look to my.harvard when course shopping.
Former Computer Science 50 head teaching fellow Robert T. Bowden ’13, who has updated the external tool for several semesters, said the new my.harvard interface disrupted the data feeds the site previously used to update its information. While the my.harvard staff sent him most of the data he needed to update the tool, Bowden said, he had to manually scrape my.harvard for some other information, like that regarding Gen Ed credit and instructors.
CS50 Courses saw a drop in traffic, somewhere around 10 to 20 percent, compared to previous years, which Bowden attributed in part to the fact that it was initially out of date.
Regarding the official my.harvard tool, some students were also frustrated by what they termed an absence of core functionality—peer advising fellow Harrison X. Becker ’17, for example, said he initially could not see who his freshman advisees were and that they could not view their course placement test scores on the platform. The my.harvard team eventually resolved these issues, he said.
Elodie A. Saint-Louis ’18, meanwhile, noted that the button that supposedly links course listings to the Coop website leads to an error message, at least for some courses.
“So I have to open a new tab, go to the website, and search for my classes,” Saint-Louis said. “What’s the point if it’s not working?”
Burke said administrators will add additional functionalities—such as a new plan of study tool and a concentration declaration service—throughout the semester and later on. Burke said students will have an incentive to use the new official tool instead of CS50 Courses in the future because it integrates student records into one platform and guarantees accuracy.
Students like Zach C. Chambers ’18, however, still used CS50 Courses this shopping period. And Bowden, for his part, said CS50 Courses will not be discontinued, at least for the time being.
“As long there’s a student who prefers using CS50 Courses over the my.harvard system, we will happily continue supporting them,” he concluded.
The my.harvard team has hired more than a dozen students to serve as “ambassadors” for the fall semester and host office hours to answer questions about the new interface and hear feedback. They will be paid $1,000 for their work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a video documenting the first meeting of an introductory computer science course at Yale, a cohort of teaching fellows wave their hands enthusiastically and hundreds of students in the audience cheer.
“I’m here to introduce...all of the students at Yale who as of this morning have made this the most popular course at Yale,” course instructor Brian Scassellati says, facing the camera with a grin.
The course, CPSC 100a: “Introduction to Computing and Programming,” marks the first time that Yalies can count themselves among the hundreds of students who this semester will take Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” the flagship introductory computer science course at Harvard that has become as much a campus cultural phenomenon as a class. 
After both schools approved plans for the high-profile class to cross over to New Haven this fall and course staff spent the summer coordinating the logistics of the expansion, both classes started on Wednesday.
Both Sanders Theatre, the home to massive CS50 lectures at Harvard, and an auditorium at Yale “seemed quite full,” David J. Malan ’99, a Computer Science professor of the practice who teaches the course in Cambridge, wrote in an email.
Yale Law School auditorium, with a capacity of about 500 students, was completely full, according to Jason C. Hirschhorn ’14-’15, a former CS50 teaching fellow at Harvard who now works full time on the CPSC 100a staff. In Sanders, Malan and his teaching staff introduced their Yale counterparts through Scassellati’s video.
Although the course will operate on two campuses and students enroll under different catalog titles, the material will be “one and the same,” Malan wrote in an email. Each campus will have its own sections, office hours, lunches, and a CS50 fair, where students showcase their final projects.
CS50 lectures, meanwhile, will occur primarily in Cambridge, and taped versions will stream to Yale students. Course staff have also arranged buses to take Yalies from New Haven to Cambridge this Saturday for CS50 “Puzzle Day” and the CS50 hackathon in December.
CPSC 100a has also added a section specifically for Yale faculty and staff members, according to Hirschhorn.
The Yale course leaders say they are eager to be part of the hype surrounding the immensely popular course, which has attracted thousands of students over time and was recently parodied by anonymous critics on Harvard’s campus and online.
“This is an extremely exciting experiment,” Scassellati said in an interview. “We’ve never done anything like this.”
Scassellati and Yale computer science department chair Joan Feigenbaum both said the class marks a turning point in the school’s approach to the discipline, specifically with its focus on the practical applications of programming.
“For many years, we had heard from Yale students that they wanted a more real-world focused introductory course,” Feigenbaum said.
Scassellati called CPSC 100a the first of its kind at Yale. “We’ve never had a course that’s really, I think, quite so targeted to students with no experience before,” he said.
Hirschhorn wrote in an email that students seemed to enjoy the opening lecture at Yale on Wednesday, asking questions about problem sets and sections.
“During dinner that evening, one student even sat down with me to talk about the binary bulbs demo!” he wrote.

UPDATED: September 4, 2015, at 2:26 a.m.
Coming off a difficult season during the 2014-2015 campaign, the Harvard women’s rugby team is looking to start off the season strong as it faces University of Prince Edward Island and Bowdoin at Bowdoin on Saturday.
After a season marred by injuries, the team (6-16-1, 5-7-1 Ivy) is looking to bounce back against two opponents it has never faced.
The Panthers are also looking to start a strong season behind Team Canada standout sophomore Alysha Corrigan. The Polar Bears, meanwhile, went 11-2 last year under the reins of Team USA All-American senior Addison Carvajal.
After a strong preseason, co-captain Lydia Burns is confident in the new squad and the team dynamic.
“This is a chance to really pull everything from preseason together,” Burns said. “We’ve got a lot of new players and new talents, and I think it’s going to be a nice way to showcase that and really bring it all together in a more competitive setting than practice.”
The Crimson squad is one with plenty of talent and much of it young. The team features six incoming freshman joined by eight sophomores. Co-captain Hope Schwartz, a former Crimson sports editor, says she is looking forward to playing with the young squad.
“I think that we have some very strong recruits and very strong returning players. We’ve set our outcome expectations very high,” Schwartz said. “One thing that’s really cool about our freshmen is that they all come from a variety of rugby backgrounds. We have two players from overseas who played internationally.”
As women’s rugby is still a fairly new varsity sport at Harvard, many players come in with little to no prior rugby experience. However, this was not the case this year, as four out of the six incoming freshman played rugby before arriving this fall in Cambridge.
One of the freshmen is Scotland native Susie Clements, who was a member of the U19 Scotland Rugby 7’s. Fellow freshman Genevieve Quirion of Canada also comes in with prior rugby experience, competing for Stanstead College and Team Quebec.
Joining Clements and Quirion is rookie Caitlin Weigel, a three-time All-Ohio and All-Midwest rugby player. Akweley Okine rounds out the incoming freshmen with prior rugby experience, playing four years for the West Chester Girls RFC.
One of the biggest changes to the team dynamic came last year when the team played 7’s rugby for the first time. Over the latter half of last year’s season, the team played in six 7’s tournaments. Schwartz mentioned the change in style of play has definitely improved the team overall.
“It was super important for us to work on our skills: specifically a lot of skill work related to passing, related to how we play through contact, and more reps,” Schwartz said. “A lot of the skills from 7’s really translate, and they’ve made us a much more technically sound team.”
Now three years since the start of the program, coach Sue Parker has seen her share of success with Harvard winning the Ivy League Championship two years back and taking a third-place finish last year. The team is coming back with a bit more experience, and the players are excited for the start of the season.
“I think that in general this year we have more depth and we have more experience,” Schwartz said. “While last year was definitely challenging in terms of having a young team and having an inexperienced team, now...we have a little more depth and we're able to play people at the positions where they are more comfortable and more experienced.”
The team is looking to return healthy and has its sights set on playing in nationals after a hard-fought loss in the semifinals of last years American Collegiate Rugby Association National Championship 7’s.
“We were playing some of the top teams in the country, and we were able to compete,” Burns said.
Despite its youth, the team lost quite a bit of talent in last year’s senior class with captain Brooke Kantor and U.S. national team member and offensive power Cheta Emba.
However, the team still has several standout returning players in junior and Brazilian national team fly-half Taciana Pereira, sophomore Maya Learned, and co-captains Schwartz and Burns.
“The thing is, people step up every year, and it’s not just seniors,” Burns said. “There’s a lot that we’re doing, but it’s a team effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 4, 2015, at 2:07 a.m.
­Nine games. Nine victories. That’s how the story unfolded for the Harvard men’s soccer team within the comforts of Soldiers Field and Ohiri Field in 2014.
Nonetheless, it didn’t change the fact that for the third consecutive year, the Crimson failed to come away with a win in its season opener. So when Harvard welcomes Loyola Marymount to Cambridge for its first game of the season on Friday, something has to give.
“The past couple years, we haven’t got out to the starts that we’ve wanted, so to get off to a good start this weekend would be great for us,” junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “And that’s what we’re expecting.”
The Crimson enters 2015 on the heels of its most successful season in recent memory. After a slow start where Harvard needed four tries to secure its first win, the Crimson never looked back. A 3-2 overtime win over Boston College in Harvard’s home opener catalyzed a run that saw the Crimson finish 11-1-2 over its final 14 games.
But that stretch was highlighted by a 4-1-2 record against Ivy League competition, leaving a conference title and an NCAA Tournament bid just out of Harvard’s reach for the second consecutive season.
Now in coach Pieter Lehrer’s third season at the helm, the Crimson will look to get over the hump and end its six-year conference title drought.
The team will kick things off against two sides that have made recent trips to the Big Dance — Loyola Marymount (2-0-0) and No. 23 Southern Methodist (2-0-0).
LMU, who finished 9-4-6 in 2014, enters its tilt with Harvard riding the momentum of back-to-back shutout victories. The Lions are led by junior midfielder Adrien Perez, who recorded a team-leading 17 points last year and already has a goal and an assist through two games.
Then on Sunday, Harvard will turn its attention to SMU, who pieced together 10 wins last year and broke into the National Soccer Coaches Association of America’s Top 25 last week.
The Mustangs returned both their top scorer and top assist-getter from last season—senior forward Idi Camara and sophomore defenseman Jared Rice—who notched seven goals and eight assists, respectively.
Senior defenseman Mark Ashby, who will be serving as a co-captain of the Crimson for the second straight season, says that there are three things he’ll be looking to see from his team in its first two bouts and throughout the year: defensive tenacity, domination on set pieces, and offensive creativity.
“We’re not starting from square one; we’re just building off of last year,” Ashby said. “So I think continuing [last year’s] success is going to be what we expect.”
Following the graduation of co-captain midfielder Kyle Henderson ’15, Ashby will lead Harvard onto the pitch alongside Wheeler-Omiunu and senior goaltender Evan Mendez, who were both promoted to co-captains this offseason.
“It’s nice having three captains because we’re able to share responsibility and help each other out really well,” Ashby said. “We’ve been playing together for many years now, so we’re really familiar with each other, and I trust them as decision makers just as much as I trust myself.”
Ashby and Wheeler-Omiunu combined for five goals and three assists last season, while Mendez picked up a career-high 56 saves to go along with 10 wins. Ashby also earned the title of Ancient Eight Defensive Player of the Year.
Also returning to the Crimson is senior midfielder and striker Tim Schmoll, who led the team with five goals in 2014, including the overtime winner against BC in Harvard’s first win.
Sophomore midfielders Christian Sady, Nate Divine, and Sam Brown—last year's Ivy League Rookie of the Year—will also look to improve upon rookie campaigns in which they each tied for the team lead with five assists.
In addition, the team has welcomed five freshmen to the squad and a total of seven new additions overall.
With the Crimson retaining what he calls a “core group of guys,” Ashby says that the team has big aspirations for the upcoming season. Wheeler-Omiunu even mentioned the possibility of winning a national title. But no one’s looking that far ahead just yet.
“We know that if we stay focused, the end goal will come,” Ashby said. “Obviously we have ambitions, but right now, we’re just looking at LMU.”
