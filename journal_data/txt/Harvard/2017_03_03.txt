After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final season of Lena Dunham’s often controversial, often hilarious, TV series, the self-professed “voice of her generation,” Hannah Horvath, finds herself (for the first time in a long time) on what seems like an upward career trajectory that might finally lead her towards maturity.
The episode opens with a major event in Hannah’s newly revived writing career—her story is published in The New York Times column, “Modern Love.” The audience sees Marnie reading it while sitting on a toilet, and Jessa naked with Adam. The message is clear: “Girls” aims to be as provocative in terms of its displays of human bodies as it has been in its first five seasons. However, these displays are perhaps the opposite of what has been termed “sexposition” in a certain HBO show that involves far more dragons and murder—in contrast, bodies on “Girls” can be seen as a statement of purpose, a testament to the sincerity of its satire.
The majority of the plot of the first episode revolves around Hannah’s assignment to write a feature on a surf camp for wealthy, aimless women. Her editor describes her angle quite bluntly, making it completely obvious that the true reason she was chosen for the task is that she is not skinny. But such normally uncomfortable insensitivity is masterfully made entertaining by Chelsea Peretti of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” That same truly funny scene sees Hannah displaying some of her writerly talent in a pithy observation (she describes herself as “witty, yet narcissistic.”), but the rest of the episode hints towards Hannah’s personal growth out of her millennial bumblings at the surf camp.
Hannah’s surf trip to Montauk initially just makes fun of wealthy women who have the time to engage in such decadence (decadence that has adapted to the age of homemade kombucha and omnipresent kale salads)—but that is actually of marginal importance to the more important themes of the episode (and likely the season). The true cultural commentary comes not from these cartoonish, manic, and often completely silent women. It comes from the equally melancholic and funny transformation that Hannah undergoes when she encounters laid back surfer “dude” Paul-Louis, played by “The Night Of” alum Riz Ahmed. She has to confront her own romantic expectations and projections with Ahmed’s Paul-Louis, and surprisingly, she does seem to move past her romantic expectations with fewer mental obstacles than in earlier seasons—an indication of at least some progress away from girlhood, towards adulthood.
Despite the more pensive moments in the later half of the unusually long episode, there is also a lot of physical comedy in Hannah’s attempts at surfing and her uninhibited dancing that results in her spilling drinks all over herself and the dancefloor. This scene in fact feels pleasantly reminiscent of her raves with Andrew Rannells’s delectably mean-spirited Elijah in earlier seasons. The show’s cinematography also remains consistent with the indie aesthetic that permeated the earlier seasons, although there does seem to be an innovation in the form of sweeping shots of Hannah and Jean-Louis making out on a beach, a style that looks borrowed from director Paolo Sorrentino, newly arrived at HBO.
Of course, the episode also lays the groundwork for what will likely be the plot for the rest of the season. Marnie undergoes another confrontation with her Fleetwood Mac-obsessed soon-to-be ex-husband. (Interestingly, most cultural criticism the show attracts seems to focus on the self-absorbed immaturity of the titular girls, but it is the men on the show who are almost without exception laughably infantile—the annoyingly yet characteristically self-centered Adam only meets his match in Jessa.) Additionally, Marnie’s new relationship with Ray is tested by the fact that he moves in with his former girlfriend Shoshanna. This meandering of plot between Marnie and Hannah stops the episode from achieving the almost poetic beauty of some of the most successful episodes of the fifth season—such as the Marnie-centric and very cinematic “The Panic in Central Park”—but even without such a perfect manifestation of Aristotelian unity, the episode is a very strong opening to the show’s final season.
“Girls” should be appreciated—it’s funnier than most consider it to be, and the shortcomings of the characters should not be confused with the (much rarer) shortcomings of the show. The show grew up a long time ago, and it seems like it’s time for its characters to finally catch up with it.

Sensual encounters and whispered lines, a damning social reality in existentialist black and white, café conversations, and maybe a suicide or two. These are the oft-parodied stereotypes of the European art film, and the new movie from festival regular François Ozon hits all the old notes. “Frantz” walks and talks like arthouse cinema, and it could be placed in competition at any major film festival without anyone batting an eye (the film screened at Venice). But its adherence to the overly serious formulas of European film can only end in self-parody.
“Frantz” opens with a corpse and a stranger. World War I has just concluded, and German casualty Frantz (Anton Von Lucke) has been interned to the mourning of his parents (Ernst Stötzner and Marie Gruber) and fiancé (Paula Beer), but a new figure is seen in the dim streets of Quedlinburg, Germany, placing flowers on the fresh grave. The atmosphere is reminiscent of one of Alfred Hitchcock’s English films about another unsettling arrival, the serial killer narrative “The Lodger”, but “Frantz” is no story of London fog—everything here is plain as day. The largely unambiguous narrative receives its only gloss of the uncanny by way of a moody string leitmotif, an empty sign to let the audience know there is mystery afoot.
And the mystery element is arguably the film’s selling point compared to its treatment of sex. While there is no onscreen depiction of physical love, the erotic tension in flashbacks between Frantz and the stranger, French soldier Adrien Rivoire (Pierre Niney), is the main site of self-parody in the movie. One particular violin lesson where Adrien deftly touches Frantz’s bow-arm from behind is only so far removed from the infamous pottery wheel scene from “Ghost” where Patrick Swayze straddles Demi Moore as they rhythmically shape the clay. From continent to continent, the idea of the erotic as a classed-up, artsy form of sex continues to be humorously misguided.
To avoid the awkward self-parody of the film’s over-the-top seriousness, it might have helped Ozon to make a full turn into comedy. Based on Ernst Lubitsch’s drama “Broken Lullaby”, “Frantz” is ironically in greatest need of the laughs found in the Lubitsch comedies of manners for which he is best known. The World War II Lubitsch film “To Be or Not to Be” surrounding a theater troupe resisting the Nazis in Poland, was a comedy of ongoing trauma, daring to make jokes during the Holocaust and proving all the more emotionally devastating for not avoiding near history. In comparison, the nearly century-wide gap between World War I and “Frantz” renders this bland narrative of Franco-German catharsis even less relatable in the modern age.
A portrait of two cultures that does a disservice to both, “Frantz” depicts France and Germany as one-dimensionally as it does post-war history. The French drink wine, the Germans drink beer. The French have the Louvre, the Germans have a folksy, seasonal festival. Despite the attention to lighting and costume, which are often the strong points of Ozon’s work, the period piece fails to flesh out its chosen time. Compared to true masters like Lubitsch, what Ozon lacks is the ability to create and populate a world, instead of describing it with bland clichés.

Nothing much happens in “After the Storm,” a family drama written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, but this never seems to matter: It is less a story than a journey for the audience to get to know the characters. The film follows Ryota (Hiroshi Abe), an author-turned private detective and inveterate gambler, over the course of several days. Koreeda gradually reveals Ryota’s relationships with his mother Yoshiko (Kirin Kiki); his sister Chinatsu (Satomi Kobayashi); and most of all with his ex-wife Kyoko (Yoko Maki) and son Shingo (Taiyô Yoshizawa). Overlaying the human interactions is the threat of an incoming typhoon, one that traps Ryota in his mother’s apartment with Kyoto and Shingo and drives the climactic moment of the film.
Koreeda’s greatest triumph in “After the Storm” is the way in which he generates understanding without exposition. Never once is there a clunky moment in the film’s dialogue. Koreeda leaves the audience to piece together the story from the characters’ side comments and remarks. These are rarely explained fully, and an unobservant viewer may miss details of the family dynamics. This, however, only adds to the intense realism of the film, and suggests the characters’ intimate knowledge of each other. Koreeda leaves the audience to figure out the characters and their relationships.
None of these relationships change significantly throughout the film. Ryota’s attempts to win back Kyoko fail, his sister still doesn’t trust him, and he’s still a gambler who’s always in need of cash. There is very little real drama and very few moments that will significantly affect any of the characters’ lives. Yet the film is never boring—every moment, every conversation is relevant and helps the audience discover who these people are.
However, Ryota has changed subtly by the end of the movie. Koreeda leaves the audience with little hope that Ryota and Kyoko will ever get back together, or even that he’ll ever finish his second novel. But at the very least he seems to have a renewed commitment to fatherhood. Still, Koreeda resists the temptation to tell a tale of redemption. Only the slightest hints are given that Ryota is on a better path—him giving Shingo sole rights to lottery tickets they bought together, for example. Ultimately, it remains an open question whether he has gone through any transformative growth.
Other brilliant features include the cinematography and the acting. The camerawork is simple and clean and fits well with the human scale of the picture. In terms of acting, the whole ensemble does solid work, but a few bright spots shine out. Abe’s portrayal of Ryota makes what could otherwise be an unappealing character a lovable loser. The true star, however, is Kiki. Yoshiko is already a huge part of the film, but Kiki’s performance makes one wish her role was even larger. She embodied the sweetly sad and funny character in a remarkable way. Her interactions with Ryota in particular set a new standard for depictions of relationships between elderly mothers and their adult children. Ryota is at once a good friend and her misguided son, and Kiki nimbly dances the blurred lines between these roles.
In the last minutes of the movie, the storm clears. Little has been washed away, either from the streets or the characters. The rain has created the potential for new growth, however, and this slight hope gives the film its power.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I shifted my phone to my other ear as the soothingly bland, vaguely jazzy ‘hold’ music restarted. I was on hold with Harvard University Health Services, trying to schedule an appointment with a physician in the Obstetrics & Gynecology department, which handles women’s reproductive health.
I wanted to get an IUD, a long-term reversible birth control option. Finally taking me off of hold, the person on the other end informed me that the office  was not booking IUD procedures until April. At that time, it was still February, almost two months away.
‘Have you considered Planned Parenthood?’ the receptionist asked. ‘Other patients have had better luck going through them.’ I was surprised that my university’s health service, mandated to serve a demographic comprised of many sexually active young women, was so ill-equipped to provide contraceptive counseling and access to the full range of contraceptive methods. Trump’s public threats to defund Planned Parenthood and dismantle the Affordable Care Act have thrown America’s  contraceptive access  into question; it is unacceptable for health services like Harvard’s to put the university’s own provision of contraceptive care on hold.
IUDs, T-shaped devices that are smaller than a tea bag, are among the most effective and best-tolerated forms of long-term birth control available. Studies have shown that with "usual" (rather than "perfect") use,  about 17 percent of women using condoms alone and 9 percent of people on a birth control pill or patch will get pregnant in a year. Less than 1 percent of people with a hormone-containing or copper IUD, though, will get pregnant. While we still need condoms to prevent against sexually transmitted infections, IUDs are a much better choice for preventing pregnancy.
Hormone-containing IUDs work by delivering very low-dose progesterone directly to the uterus, which thins its lining and makes it an inhospitable environment for sperm and implantation (the upside: absent or lighter periods). Relative to birth control pills, IUDs contain lower hormone doses, which means women experience fewer hormonal side effects like acne, weight gain, and mood changes. Non-hormonal IUDs are made of copper, which is toxic to sperm, and may be preferable for women who feel uncomfortable about hormones (the downside: heavier periods and more cramping).
In a five-minute, office-based procedure, a gynecologist or primary care doctor inserts an IUD into a woman's uterus where it can stay for 3-5 years (hormone-containing) or 10 years (non-hormonal). IUDs can be removed at any time, and fertility returns to normal, typically within a single cycle.
HUHS should be making every effort to provide information about, and access to, effective female contraception on demand and without a substantial wait. True, contraception is now much more readily available to students than it once was. Dispensers providing free condoms have sprung up in laundry rooms. Even so, it is worth pausing for a moment over this tendentious connection between condom boxes and our communal 'dirty laundry.' The message, however unconscious, seems to be that contraceptive use is still a private matter whose public exposure brings distress and embarrassment.
Furthermore, it is a pernicious idea that condoms and the pill together represent the sine qua non of protected sex. Condom use is, at best, a mutual initiative, discussed and implemented on a case-by-case basis. At worst, it is a male prerogative. The pill, which appears to supply a necessary corrective, is more available but has proven less effective and often comes with unpleasant side effects. IUDs, on the other hand, give women agency over their bodies with a lower risk of side effects. As Harvard discusses consent and sexual empowerment, access to effective contraception, like IUDs, should be inserted into the greater campus conversation about consent.
Silence around female contraception seems symptomatic of a lingering culture of shame that continues to surround women’s bodies. Somehow, it is still easier to talk openly and without embarrassment about the various dressings-up of the male penis, than it is to discuss penetrative procedures involving the female vagina. We want to see posters explaining IUDs next to flyers for plays, sporting events, and workshops at the Bureau of Study Council. When students took on the stigma of mental health on campus and called for the expansion of mental health services, HUHS listened and expanded access. We should do the same for contraception, especially since contraception is a primary health care need for sexually active, university-aged women.
We should ask each other and our doctors more questions about our bodies and our contraceptive options. We should ask HUHS to hire more gynecologists. We should ask our HUHS primary care physicians (not just our gynecologists) to become trained in how to insert IUDs. We can call on Harvard to make education about and access to female contraception a priority, not an afterthought.
With insurance coverage for contraception under threat due to the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act and reduction of funding for Planned Parenthood, it is of particular importance for universities to take a strong stand for contraception access. IUDs are a matter of private choice. But access to them needs to be very public.

On the 1 Bus to Roxbury a man sat next to me and claimed to be a real live Panther. He placed his feet in the middle of the aisle, cold. I came from Alabama, he said. Power to the people, he said. I’m a real live Panther, he said. He picked a fight with the white boy behind me. The bus driver got up. The man resisted. His side sifted close then far from mine. I looked for sympathy like a wallet, lost. When I was thirteen I walked through a furniture store in Flushing with my best friend, who was a poet, and told her I’d decorate my college room like this, glossy. My fingers passed through red lamps. When we got out, she told me she saw a man talking to himself in the Au Bon Pain across the street. Later, she wrote three poems on him. She remembers him as I do, distant. When we passed through this Christmas we passed by beggars and old men with nonchalance, grace. Do you write poems about strangers anymore? I asked. We walked on, beat, because it was no longer fashionable to love strangers, to imagine their lives with care. The world had expanded since we were children, and we deemed outsiders useless, a survival tactic.
Only very recently have I come to understand my campus as a socialist construct, in every way ideal, in our security and collectivity, our concerns intangible, our focus on self-realization/development/love. Of course, this analogy is useless in the capitalism vs. socialism debate that continues among academics, since our institution exists in the context of capitalism, and our reality is shaped by massive donations to financial aid programs, the existence of cooking and janitorial staff, competitive incomes for Harvard faculty, and most importantly, the truth that our stint here is brief. But like a child, I found it useful to say that we are all happy here on a physical level, to acknowledge the privilege of existing in a society, however insular, however brief, that establishes community in its organization, emphasizes the right to be transformed, and gives us the liberty to do so, to exist how we would like to.
I wanted to emphasize this realization because it occurred to me recently the gravity of this privilege and the multiple ways it still seems to fail. I met someone the other day through a mutual friend, a white boy, who illustrated his ideal society as one where people exchanged thoughts, ideas, feelings, in common spaces, a place not unlike this campus. He was in love with a black girl, in those words, and told me the multiple ways in which this campus, as a branch of society, had failed her. Somehow, I didn’t find the fact that these two ideas existed so and equally strongly in one mind incongruous. It was, instead, a reasonable assertion to believe that social organization didn’t fail people, but society did. We could exist in a well-organized society structured equally, but still not get along with others because we choose to feel neutrally or even to hate. But is this really a problem? It is a belief commonly held among socialists, especially the fashionable, elite, college, Canada-Goose wearing type, for whom it is fair to say socialism was not made, that the major difference between capitalism and socialism is one of intention, where capitalists exchange to benefit themselves and socialists exchange to benefit others. A sense of community binds socialist societies while a sense of necessity binds capitalist ones. A socialist society is free of discrimination, hard feelings, competition, and exploitation, which makes it undeniably beautiful. But we are not gods, and community is difficult to achieve, because we organize the world positively and negatively, through what we like and what we don’t like. The call to reorganize society to counteract very human, very basic feelings of hatred and prejudice seems evasive.
How do we extend sympathy to those half-alive, incomplete, iced? And what does this sympathy look like? Do we extend our sympathy when our efforts are unreciprocated? I was faced with this question recently. The man in question, brown, was a stranger but also a Facebook friend. He posted daily about the hypocrisy, racism, and complacency of yellow females who date white men. He wrote about the documentary “Seeking Asian Female” about a white man’s objectification of his yellow female lover, and the fact that filmmaker Debbie Lum was married to a white man. He claimed that Asian women were so racist that they never considered brown or black men in the conversation of yellow fever, let alone associate with them in social scenarios. He referred to forming relationships with yellow Americans as “The Asian Game.” The claims were grounded but uncomfortable because though I recognized similar hypocrisies in my community, I approached them with the assumption of love, while he discussed them with vitriol. But what was clear to me, even refreshing, after scrolling through pages of posts ridiculing, blaming, and criticizing yellow females like myself, was a narrative of the formation of his discrimination, which was more human than I had expected. He had felt, on a fundamental level, betrayal. And because he was understandable, he was deserving of sympathy. Discrimination was a helpful survival mechanism in deflecting something more basic, because at the core, his prejudice was personal hurt disguised as social trend. But I extended sympathy precisely because I was a stranger and unaffected, because I was comfortable enough in my identity to criticize it. If I was not, however, it would be fair for me to not see the betrayal, hurt, or confusion in favor of demonization, which would be my blindness, necessary since people of color know best the dangers of misplaced sympathy. If I had been touchable, would hatred have been useful in this situation to keep myself intact? How would I have understood him if I did not feel deeply uncomfortable at first?
We, as members of society, do not all get along, which is fine. Negativity is a powerful way to organize society and has much usefulness in understanding ourselves, validating our own feelings, finding our voices. There is an incredible use of hatred, of figuring out what we dislike, that must be acknowledged before we claim community and universal, indiscriminate love, because if we ignore these negativities, we allow our sadness to turn to anger, our anger to turn to bitterness. But more importantly, we must, after acknowledging our negativities, ask why. Why was it necessary to have a n-----, a whore, a gook, or a f----- in the first place? When did you learn to hate the people around you? And what was it you wanted when you stood on your pedestal, stroking the dolls at your feet?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson reported that a sanctions implementation committee formed last November has recommended stricter penalties for members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, proposing barriers for more fellowships and—much more disconcertingly—Undergraduate Council leadership positions, which are democratically elected by the student body. Though the committee’s report is still undergoing review by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and may not translate to actual policy, we urge administrators not to move forward with this illiberal and paternalistic measure.
The proposed sanctions, which are already under review by another committee, only punish individual members of single-gender organizations within the scope of their personal lives. Denying privileges such as team captaincies and fellowship recommendations is under the jurisdiction of the College; these are honors granted by Harvard.
By contrast, the right to elect UC leaders lies exclusively with the undergraduate student body. Harvard would be abusing its authority were it to vet the leaders that undergraduates freely chose. Moreover, this measure would indirectly punish the entire student body rather than individuals, as students would not be able to cast a vote for their preferred leader. The underlying premise is that the administration knows better than undergraduates, democracy and students’ autonomy be damned.
The implications of this potential measure are not merely hypothetical. Current UC president Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 is a member of the all-female Bee Club and is not the first member of a final club to serve in the role. If administrators decide to include the UC presidency as one of the leadership roles covered by the sanctions, they threaten to infringe on a democratic process that has elected students in final clubs. Indeed, Sachee herself was elected after the announcement of the sanctions.
That said, we do not believe that final club membership is entirely irrelevant to student government. Final clubs are bastions of privilege whose members benefit from resources, especially institutionalized social capital, that have an effect on the way UC elections transpire. With this in mind, we believe that individual students, rather than the administration, should make the decision to be transparent about their social affiliations. In particular, members of such single-gender social organizations should address how they can represent the entirety of the student population while remaining members of such bastions of exclusion.
Furthermore, we urge UC leaders to continue to take measures to strengthen democratic representation. These could include increasing turnout in order to assure that the voting process is as broad as possible, and stipends—which have already been implemented—in order to assure that all students can run for office.
Indeed, there are many steps that can be taken to fortify our student government. Intrusion from the administration, however, is not one of them. In the words of former UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, both vociferous supporters of the sanctions, the “vetting of elected members of student government based on affiliation in certain groups is detrimental, and fundamentally opposed, to the vivacity of the democratic process.”

A spreadsheet containing personal information and confidential evaluation data about admitted Economics doctoral students was mistakenly sent to current graduate students last week.
In a letter Economics Department Chair David I. Laibson sent to affected students, Laibson wrote that the spreadsheet was intended to provide contact information for the new students. But the spreadsheet also included “hidden columns” with confidential comments from the admissions committee about each student, as well as their nationalities, genders, and names of Harvard faculty they would be interested in working with, according to the letter obtained by The Crimson.
In an interview, Laibson said the evaluation data consisted of only short “telegraphic comments.”
“Those cells reflected not a complete process on the part of the admissions committee but a partial process,” he said. “It’s impossible to look at those cells and infer the committee's deliberation.”
In his letter, Laibson informed accepted students that he had requested recipients of the spreadsheet to “permanently delete” the file.
Laibson said the department has taken two steps to prevent future mistakes. First, the individual who sent the file is now required to have any emails they send over the list receive reviewed by the department’s leadership.
“The second precaution that we’re taking is a wholesale review and revision of our email usage system and that includes taking a look at all of our listservs, determining who has access to those listservs, likely tightening usage of those listservs, likely tightening the permissions that we have for what types of documents can be sent to those listservs,” Laibson said.
Laibson says he expects to roll out a new listserv policy within a week.
This is not the first time this year that a technical error has led to the inadvertent availability of confidential information. In February, the Harvard Computer Society made private thousands of email lists after The Crimson informed the organization that more than 1.4 million emails—some containing confidential or sensitive information—sent over HCS-hosted lists were open to the public.
In the letter to admitted students, Laibson encouraged students to contact him with questions about the incident.
“On behalf of the department, I apologize for the serious mistake and the concern it will cause you,” he wrote.

Drained after months of work, seniors at the College are beginning to finish their theses, and History and Literature concentrators turned in their works this week.
Though not all seniors at the College choose to write theses, History and Literature is an “honors concentration” which requires all concentrators to pursue one. Students begin research for their theses as early as the summer before their senior year.
Director of Studies for the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature Lauren O. Kaminsky said all of the theses within History and Literature are necessarily interdisciplinary, adding another level of rigor to the process.
“You’re engaging with multiple scholarly conversations. Very often you’re using multiple languages and methods of research. It can be difficult to manage these different methods and modes of analysis simultaneously,” Kaminsky said.
Kaminsky said the department tries to provide enough support so that students can write on a wide range of topics.
“History and Literature, specifically, does a really good job of supporting individual research,” agreed William L. Ezekowitz ’17, a senior in the concentration.
Ezekowitz wrote his thesis about American high school football in the Cold War, “especially as a repository for American values.” Ezekowitz said he got the idea for the topic from a book he read his junior fall in his History and Literature tutorial.
Hana S. Connelly ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, wrote her History and Literature thesis on the kidnapping of two Georgian princesses. She said she enjoyed the thesis-writing process.
“It does feel like I have something tangible to point to as a culmination of what I studied here,” Connelly said.
Kaminsky said the day seniors turn in their thesis marks a celebration not only for the individual student, but also for the entire department.
“There is a kind of community spirit that is part of today’s celebration” Kaminsky added. “It becomes a moment of celebration for all of the History and Literature community.”
Though History and Literature seniors are now done with their theses, many thesis-writers are still finishing up their capstone projects. The deadline for Applied Mathematics theses, for instance, is not until after spring break.
Other seniors decided to not write a thesis for their concentration.
“I am completely relieved that I decided to not write a thesis. I am pre-med, so writing one wouldn’t do anything for my future,” said Molly J. Y. Zhao ’17, an Integrative Biology concentrator.

Gwyneth McClendon, an assistant professor of Government since 2013, will leave Harvard at the end of this academic year, marking the Government department’s second loss of a female faculty member since Beth Simmons left in June 2016 for the University of Pennsylvania.
McClendon’s and Simmons’ departures leave the already predominantly male Government department even farther from gender equity, according to Claudine Gay, divisional dean of social science and a Government professor. Of the department’s more than 45 professors, less than a quarter are women, according to information from the department’s website.
“Gov definitely needs some attention. We suffered a really big loss when Beth Simmons left, and we were already operating at a low number of female faculty, especially at the tenure track ranks, but also at the senior ranks,” Gay said. “So finding ways to create more faculty diversity within Gov is definitely a priority for me.”
Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild also expressed concerns about “diversity issues” in the department. While the faculty departures constitute a “small number of people,” she said, the losses are “a very large proportion” of the department’s female faculty.
“We have relatively few junior faculty, untenured faculty, who are not white men. We have relatively few women on the faculty and relatively few non-Anglo,” Hochschild said.
At the Faculty’s February meeting, Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser said diversity within FAS remains “concerning,” though the body has neared hiring an equal share of male and female ladder faculty members. Twenty-nine percent of the Faculty are women this academic year, according to Zipser, and they may face additional burdens—from a lack of mentoring to more pressure to serve on administrative committees.
Hochschild said “gender” and “family issues” may also play a role in female faculty members’ decisions to leave Harvard.
Moving forward, Gay said she expects the process of diversifying the department to begin with “more aggressive and assertive” recruitment processes.
“I think one of the biggest things is making sure at the very start of the process we’re working to build a diverse pool,” Gay said. “To do that requires not just posting on a central hiring site and waiting for applications to roll in.”
According to Hochschild, the department is currently searching for a replacement for McClendon.
“Fortunately I’ve got a terrific partner in the chair, Jennifer Hochschild, who’s absolutely energized by the task,” Gay said. “So I’m very optimistic that we’ll make some real headway there over the next couple of years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 4, 2017 at 1:42 p.m.
Hillary Clinton was on Harvard's campus Friday to discuss her time as Secretary of State and attend a luncheon in Kirkland House.
Clinton took part in an interview as part of the“ American Secretaries of State Project: Diplomacy, Negotiation, and Statecraft”, a joint project of the Kennedy School, Law School, and Business School, according to a statement from the Kennedy School.
Harvard’s Institute of Politics hosted a “Fireside Chat” with  Secretary Clinton Friday morning in Kirkland House’s with undergraduate members of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee. Five spots for the Kirkland event with Clinton were given to Kirkland residents Thursday evening.
Clinton served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Clinton ran for President of the United States beginning in May 2015, and lost the election in a victory many across the University found upsetting and surprising. Throughout her campaign, Clinton enjoyed wide support amongst both Harvard students and faculty—a Crimson survey found that roughly 87 percent of undergraduates planned to vote for the former Secretary of State in November’s election.
The American Secretaries of State Project is an effort between the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affair’s Future of Diplomacy Project and the Law School’s Program on Negotiation. Begun in 2012, it plans to interview all living former U.S. Secretaries of State about their experiences conducting international negotiations while in office.
Law School Professor Robert H. Mnookin, Business School professor James K. Sebenius, and Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns lead the project and conducted the interview with Clinton. Sebenius said the interviews with the secretaries focus on challenges they faced in office and also their political experiences with three different geographical regions—the Middle East, Russia or the former Soviet Union, and China.
“We cut it two ways, and one’s around the challenging negotiations and what we can learn from them, and that’s a special interest of all of ours,” Sebenius said. “And the other is looking at the experiences of each of these Secretaries through kind of a regional focus.”
The three professors jointly teach “Great Negotiators, Effective Diplomacy, and Intractable Conflicts”, a class on political negotiation open to students from the Law School, Business School, and Kennedy School. Burns said he and the other professors will incorporate the interviews into a variety of forthcoming projects, including a book on the negotiations of the American Secretaries of State, a series of PBS documentaries, and case studies for use in Harvard classes.
“It really has given us a sweep of American foreign policy through the eyes of the former living Secretaries of State,” Sebenius said.
Clinton is the seventh Secretary of State to take part in the project. In spring 2015, the professors hosted former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright at Harvard as part of the project. In her interview with the professors, Albright spoke about her international negotiations in both her roles as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and as the first female Secretary of State.
The project’s leaders have also interviewed former Secretaries of State George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Henry A. Kissinger, Colin L. Powell, and Condoleezza Rice about their experiences in international negotiations. The three professors are also currently writing a book on the negotiations of Secretary Kissinger.
John Kerry, who most recently served as Secretary of State under former President Barack Obama, is the only other living former Secretary who has not yet been interviewed as part of the project.

Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams outlined goals for her deanship—which range from constructing a new building to overhauling the school's organizational structure—at a school-wide meeting Monday.
The meeting followed a six-month long “listening tour” conducted last summer by Williams after her appointment in July 2016. According to the school’s website, Williams met with over 200 affiliates of the School of Public Health over the course of the tour.
“My goal was to reach out and be thoughtful in listening to as broad a group of individuals who know and care about this school and interact with this school in one way or another,” Williams said at Monday’s meeting.
During each meeting of the listening tour, Williams asked affiliates about the school's strengths and areas for improvement. Williams said one major challenge facing the School of Public Health was physical infrastructure, which she described as a “hot-button topic.”
“As a dean, I hear it about 10 or 15 times a day,” Williams said.
Williams said the school needed more space “to improve our pedagogy,” as well as more collaborative meeting spaces. Williams also said that many “envisioned a new building for the future” when discussing goals.
The School of Public Health, according to Williams, will also provide more support for faculty continued education. Additionally, Williams said the school will look to overhaul its governance structure.
“Our school governance needs work. The organizational structure requires some refinement and a need for more consistent...communication at all fronts,” she said.
Williams is also working with Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley and Harvard Dental School Dean R. Bruce Donoff to plan a Longwood Dean’s event on April 4th on the topic of “Organizing Culture.”
“Nationally, it might feel that the nation’s leadership does not support the values that we uphold as core as our public health mission,” Williams said.
In line with University President Drew G. Faust’s practices, Williams did not mention President Trump by name in her remarks.
“Having lived through the last thirty days of the new administration, it has been very clear that we will be stronger together,” Williams said.

About 20 Harvard students will travel to Vatican City for a week during spring break to participate in the first-ever Harvard Vatican Leadership Summit and potentially meet Pope Francis.
As part of the trip, the students, who come from the College as well as several of Harvard’s graduate schools, will hear Pope Francis speak, and may speak privately with him. On March 15, students will participate in a baciamano, a ceremony in which people kiss the Pope’s hand as he walks by.
“The baciamano, I think, is pretty interesting for me, because that’s the closest we might get to the Pope,” said Elam D. Jones, a student at the Divinity School who will attend the trip.
In addition to meeting the Pope, students will discuss public policy issues including Syria’s refugee crisis, education, and healthcare with Catholic Church officials.
Alondra I. Ramirez ’18 said that she is excited to discuss the Vatican’s efforts to improve education worldwide with Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi, who oversees the Vatican’s education efforts.
Okendo Lewis-Gayle, a student at the Kennedy School who organized the trip, said he hopes discussions about topics like education will make students think about their own experiences at Harvard and how they can go on to further serve “the needs of society” after graduation.
Father William T. Kelly, Pastor and Senior Chaplain at the Parish of St. Paul in Harvard Square, said the trip will also let students observe religion and daily life in Rome.
“It’s not a place where you’ll come away thinking it was overly pious, overly religious,” he said. “But you’ll see a place where religion seeps into daily life.”
Participants also said that they look forward to sharing what they learn about religion with others at Harvard after their trip.
Lewis-Gayle had the idea to organize this trip after speaking with Law School Professor Mary Ann Glendon, the former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, at a mass that they were attending.
“We noted that you’ve got all these treks everywhere...and there’s no trek to Rome,” he said. “I figured, ‘Why not?”’
Also over spring break, a group of Harvard students will travel to Israel as part of the College’s Israel Trek, sponsored by Harvard Hillel, a religious group for Jewish students.
Lewis-Gayle said that, while the Catholic summit is happening for the first time this year, he hopes it will become an annual trip.
“I am determined to make this into one of the premier ethical leadership programs in the United States,” he said.

The lights went out at the Institute of Politics’ John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
“Why are we here?” Nicco Mele, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy asked the pitch-black forum Thursday. “To celebrate journalism. Democracy dies in darkness,” he said as the lights turned back on, referencing the Washington Post’s new slogan.
“Grandiose? A little. But it’s a useful reminder about the importance of journalism,” Mele said.
So began the annual Goldsmith Awards, given annually by the Shorenstein Center to investigative journalists and prominent figures in journalism.
This year, Shane Bauer—a reporter for Mother Jones who worked at a private prison for four months and chronicled his experiences and the prison’s mismanagement—won the $25,000 top prize. A few weeks after Bauer’s four-part article came out, the Justice Department decided to end the use of private prisons.
Other finalists for the prize this year—who will each receive $10,000—included journalists from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which reported on doctors who sexually violated vulnerable patients, and The Wall Street Journal, which followed the downfall of Silicon Valley tech company Theranos, among others.
The Shorenstein Center also gave the Career Award for Excellence to Jorge Ramos, a prominent journalist and author who has been publicly critical of Donald Trump since the Trump campaign’s launch in June 2015. Ramos—who has been described as “the Walter Cronkite of Latin America”—is an anchor for Noticiero Univision, has won eight Emmy awards, and has authored 10 books.
After greeting the audience and accepting the award, Ramos paused. “I’m going to have to talk about Trump—is that okay?” Ramos asked, receiving laughter from the packed forum.
Ramos then directed a portion of his speech to Trump. “No, Mr. Trump: I am not your enemy, but honestly, I don’t want to be your friend either,” he said.
In his remarks, Ramos argued that journalists should seek to hold those in power accountable in any administration. He described the role of journalists as one “on the other side of power, regardless of who is in the White House, a Democrat or Republican.”
“There’s a beautiful word in Spanish that defines our role as journalists—contrapoder. Contra means against and poder means power,” Ramos said. “Apparently Trump thinks that only reporters who have a friendly or non-antagonistic relationship with him can accurately report about his government.”
“The last thing an independent and trustworthy reporter should do is to be a friend with the president,” he continued. “I don’t want to be his amigo.”

A federal judge has ordered Harvard to provide confidential financial information about one of its wealthy donors as part of a lawsuit involving the donor and an investor in his company.
In a lawsuit progressing in the High Court of Hong Kong, Charles C. Spackman ’94 has been accused of defrauding investors after the breakup of his company Littauer Technologies Co. Ltd in 2000. According to the suit, investor Sang Cheol Woo brought against Spackman, Woo suffered major losses after Littauer’s collapse, while Spackman reaped a personal profit of approximately $100 million.
Last week, a federal court in Boston ordered the University and Spackman’s daughter, a sophomore at Harvard, to testify and hand over documents requested under subpoena. Woo hopes that the documents will detail Spackman’s wealth and financial maneuverings.
According to the suit, Spackman has made “sizable donations” to Harvard. He was the co-chair of reunion gifts for his class, and the Alumni Association awarded him the Robert Flather ’54 award for encouraging young alumni to donate. He also created the Charles C. Spackman Scholarship Fund for students from Asia to attend Harvard.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson declined to comment.
The suit states that there is “a strong basis to believe that Harvard is in possession of donation and other records that contain wire transfer data with account and routing numbers” as well as “other information about the financial institutions and accounts that Spackman uses.”
Records Harvard produces could also provide information about “payments from the Spackman Family Trust (or other third parties), made on behalf of Spackman.”
The suit also speculates that Spackman named his former company after the Littauer Center at Harvard, where he took economics courses.
Woo brought a suit against Spackman in 2003, but the Seoul District Court initially dismissed his claims. The Seoul High Court reversed the decision and ordered Spackman to pay approximately $4.5 million. The Supreme Court of South Korea affirmed the lower court’s decision, after Spackman filed an appeal. That figure has shot to $12 million with interest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Conference tournaments are a funny thing. They provide the best teams with a few extra games to show the Selection Committee that they are deserving of a top seed or a few days off before the NCAA Tournament begins. They give streaky squads the ability to turn a good run into the Big Dance or to shoot themselves out of an at-large bid and fall into the NIT. They give Gonzaga students an excuse to spring break in Las Vegas and Monmouth diehards a reason to road trip to Albany. Next weekend, for the first time, the Ivy League will be able to experience all of the excitement and quirks of one when its top four men’s and women’s teams converge on Philadelphia.
In reality, only two Ivy League teams have something to play for this final weekend before the excitement begins the following Saturday. Columbia and Penn both sit at 5-7 in conference play, tied for the fourth and final spot in the tournament. Harvard can talk all it wants about getting revenge against a Princeton team against which it self-destructed last month. And the Tigers can take pride in the fact that it would be the first Ivy League team to run the table in conference play since Cornell did so in 2007-2008. But for Princeton and the Crimson—the top two seeds in next weekend’s tournament—and Yale, the No. 3 seed, this weekend means virtually nothing in the standings. The 2016-2017 season will be remembered for which team brings it the following weekend at the Palestra.
However, the final conference eight conference games of the season will be very telling in terms of the Ivy League’s perception entering the Big Dance. The most obvious goal of adding three additional games at the end of the season was increased exposure. The Ivy League has been riding the wave of three NCAA Tournament wins by Ancient Eight schools over the past four years. In the future, a conference tournament could allow two Ivy League teams—a dominant regular season champion and a red-hot conference tournament champion—to get into the Big Dance. While the Ivy League will not be able to have the cake and eat it too this year, this weekend will be very telling when it comes to the implications for next Saturday and Sunday.
If Harvard beats the Tigers this weekend, the Ivy League Tournament will be serving the exact purpose the conference wants it to. Assuming that both schools take care of business on Saturday, a red-hot, two-loss Crimson team would be taking on a one-loss, chip-on-its-shoulder Princeton one at the Cathedral of College Basketball. You want to talk about storylines. A young, exciting Harvard team squaring off with a veteran, lull-you-to-sleep-then-drain-threes-in-your-face Tigers squad. Siyani Chambers and the Crimson’s Super Seven freshman class going toe-to-toe with Devin Cannady and Princeton’s jump-shots-for-days frontcourt. It’s commissioner Robin Harris’ dream and whichever team wins, the conference will be happy.
Things get a little murkier if Harvard plays a tight game with the Tigers on Friday but ends up falling short for a second time. There’s probably nothing better for the conference from a national perspective if an undefeated regular season champion from a mid-major conference wins its conference tournament and enters the NCAA Tournament riding a 19-game win streak. On the flip side, a three-loss team with the nation’s 235th-ranked strength of schedule would not get nearly as much love from the tournament’s selection committee. While Princeton is penciled in as a 13-seed at the moment by most bracketology sites and could move up to a 12 with four statement wins to close out the season, The Crimson would likely get in as a 14 or 15 if it falls to the Tigers this weekend and then wins nine days later.
The last team to go undefeated in conference play during the regular season and not make the NCAA Tournament was LaVelle Moton’s 2014-2015 North Carolina Central squad. If you don’t remember much about the Eagles, you’re not alone. Long story short, the team fell to Delaware State, the five-seed in the MEAC Tournament, and was bounced from the NIT by Miami the following week.
In fact, there are only two teams left with unblemished conference marks—Princeton and 27-5 Vermont, a team that beat Harvard 82-71 way back on Jan. 2. Since the America East is not the Big East and the Ancient Eight is not the Atlantic Coast Conference, both teams would be sent packing for the NIT if they did not win their conference tournaments. Vermont just won its quarterfinal against Maine 86-41 (86-41!) so we don’t know if we would bet against the Catamounts right now, but the Tigers cleaning up next weekend is no sure thing.
Sometimes, losing can be a much-needed wake-up call. Playing with a target on your back just intensifies the pressures of March. Gonzaga losing to BYU could be a huge blessing in disguise. It’s pretty hard to find weaknesses in your game when you’re beating San Diego 96-38. Gonzaga gets a few days off, Mark Few will have several days to yell at what we would say is a very talented team, the Zags, who will get to play virtual home games in Sacramento or Salt Lake City before a brutal one-hour flight to San Jose for the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight.
We have especially fond memories of the 2003-2004 college basketball season. Jameer Nelson led an undersized, underappreciated St. Joseph’s team to a 27-0 regular season and a trip to the Elite Eight. Nelson was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated and head coach Phil Martelli was named AP College Coach of the Year. What many people forget about that team is that it was blown out by Xavier in the quarterfinals of the Atlantic Ten Tournament. You could play that game out 10 times and St. Joe’s would win nine, but two extra games before grind-it-out wins over Texas Tech and Wake Forest in the NCAA Tournament probably would not have benefitted St. Joseph’s. But that’s the Atlantic Ten, so St. Joseph’s made it in.
Princeton has not lost since Dec. 20 while Vermont has not since Dec. 10. Adding a conference tournament means that the Ivy League champion needs to win two games next weekend.
Two pressure-packed games with everything riding on them. Two
winner-take-all Ivy League games that, of all Ivy League players, really only the Crimson’s Zena Edosomwan, Corbin Miller, and Siyani Chambers have ever played in.
If the Tigers are to lose a game, it just need to make sure it happens before next Saturday.
Now to the picks:
HARVARD AT PRINCETON
Picture this.
It’s like the Oscars all over again—Warren Beatty goes up to the podium and begins to announce the winner of the regular season conference crown and looking out into the audience of about three people gives it to the natural choice, Harvard. Only it just so happens Princeton somehow went undefeated in the regular season whilst the Crimson dropped one at Columbia  and a heartbreaker to the Tigers at home.
I’m not actually sure where I was going with that one, but I will say if there were an award for ‘most entitled program as described by its school newspaper’ it would definitely go to Princeton. To quote a recent piece from the Daily Princetonian on the topic, “Princeton is currently riding an unstoppable 15-game win streak. On the flip side, Princeton is garnering little national attention for this feat.”
It’s the Ivy League for Christ’s sake. The closest thing we get to national attention is once a year when admittance rates are released. Only a few lines later, the author delves into how, “Behind Princeton, Yale and Harvard compete for a distant second.”
I realize there isn’t much to do in New Jersey, but there has to be something better to do than glorify a team that almost took a loss to Dartmouth and is only undefeated in conference because Harvard can’t get a defensive rebound.
Get over yourself, Princeton.
Pick: Harvard
CORNELL AT YALE
The Yale Daily News clearly didn’t want to be left behind in the running for the aforementioned award, so much so that it decided to write a couple hundred words on someone who hasn’t seen the floor for the Bulldogs all season.
Instead of talking about its third-seeded team going to the Palestra in two weeks, the YDN instead opted to describe how, “When guard Makai Mason ’18 suffered a season-ending foot injury in November, news organizations across the country jumped on the story.”
I would hesitate to say the story was of such epic proportions. In fact, this is the first we’ve heard about Mason’s injury being a national story. Instead, I’ll repeat what I told the people in Princeton. This is the Ivy League. No one really cares.
I might be calling Yale out, but I remain unbiased in my picks.
Pick: Yale
DARTMOUTH AT PENN
Well, now that I’ve taken time to address the Tigers, it would only be fair to do the same with a Penn team that’s fighting to keep its season alive.
The Daily Pennsylvanian provides a much more nuanced approach to the weekend, saying, “For the sake of transparency, it is worth noting that Penn does not control its destiny.” I appreciate this, and while the Quakers did in fact not smell blood last week against Columbia, it doesn’t particularly have a choice this weekend.
We reward honesty here at The Crimson. Well that and Dartmouth has also only won six games this season.
Pick: Penn
COLUMBIA AT BROWN
Brown has a student who is concentrating in ‘Happiness.’ Columbia has a fire lit under its behind.
Pick: Columbia
DARTMOUTH AT PRINCETON
Let’s go back two years. Dartmouth takes on a Yale team on the cusp of dancing for the first time since 1962. I won’t delve into the details, but the Bulldogs managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and would proceed to lose to Harvard in a one game playoff.
What a game.
The point of this is to say Dartmouth loves to help Harvard when the Crimson finds itself trying to take the Ivy League crown late in the season.
I don’t think it’ll do it this time, though.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD AT PENN
Assuming Penn and Columbia beat Dartmouth and Brown, respectively, this game means everything to the Quakers.
Even if Harvard does beat the Tigers on Friday, it would be a stretch to think Dartmouth could beat a Princeton team fresh off what would be its first conference loss.
As strange as it sounds, Harvard taking a loss might be good, as it would potentially set up Princeton against a team playing at home in the first round of the conference tournament.
Given the way Harvard has played of late, however, I don’t think it will drop a game just to make Princeton’s life a tad more difficult.
Pick: Harvard
CORNELL AT BROWN
On the bright side, each of these programs has a redeeming factor of sorts.
Brown has its ‘Happiness’ concentrator while Cornell has that weird ‘Red’ thing it does during the national anthem.
Either way, this might be the most meaningless game of the weekend.
Pick: Cornell
COLUMBIA AT YALE
The Bulldogs have looked like pugs of late. Or maybe always.
Pick: Columbia

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the last weekend of regular season play, Harvard women’s basketball looks to avenge mid-season losses against the “Killer P’s” as it hosts Princeton and Penn at Lavietes Pavilion.
Harvard (20-5, 8-4 Ivy) will play against likely opponents in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament, which takes place in Philadelphia next weekend and will propel the champion to the NCAA Tournament.
Like the Crimson, both the Tigers (14-10, 8-3 Ivy) and Quakers (17-7, 10-1 Ivy) have booked spots in the four-team Ivy League playoff.
Results on Friday and Saturday against those respective teams will solidify tournament seedings.
“The Ivy League is a long season,” senior co-captain Taylor Finley said. “Now we have the tournament to make adjustments, learn from our mistakes, and finish strong.”
With much on the line, Harvard hopes to build momentum into postseason play as it faces its two most challenging Ivy opponents.
The Crimson was handed a tough reality check the last time it played its Delaware River Valley rivals, as Penn routed Harvard 63-43 on Feb. 3 before Princeton won 63-58 in a hard-fought overtime victory the next day.
The two defeats were the bookend to the Crimson’s historic 16-game winning streak.
Since then, Harvard’s season has been defined by inconsistent performances, including defeats against Yale and Cornell, which have tainted an otherwise excellent season.
With an 8-4 conference record, Harvard looks to shore up its struggles against top-tier Ivy opponents with a strong performance this weekend at home.
In Penn, Harvard faces arguably its toughest challenge of the season, as Penn has only improved since its February victory against the Crimson. Led by the Ivy League’s rebound and block leader,  Michelle Nwokedi, the Quakers are a dominant low-post team that will pose significant challenges for Harvard.
Harvard will look towards Penn’s only Ivy defeat on Feb. 18 against Yale as proof that a successful game plan will be needed in order to defeat the Quakers.
In that game, Penn had an 18-point second half and committed 19 turnovers, eight more than its season average 11 turnovers per game. With the Bulldogs limiting the Quakers to shooting only 6-for-25 beyond the three-point line, Penn was also shut down in large part from its lack of perimeter scoring.
Although Penn has the better record of the Crimson’s two opponents this weekend, the matchup against Princeton should not be underestimated.
Winning eight of its last nine games, the Tigers have relied on the contributions of several key players, including freshman standout Bella Alarie, who leads the team with 12.7 points and 1.9 blocks per game.
Other important offensive pieces include sophomore guard Gabrielle Rush, who boasts a team-high 37.2 three-point conversion rate, as well as Leslie Robinson, who is second in team scoring with 10.2 points per game.
The Crimson will also face a strong defensive team, as the Tigers are second in the Ancient Eight in terms of points allowed with only 57.6 points per game.
“Last game [against Princeton] was not our best,” Finley said, “The game will be in our own control, such as knocking down the shots we know we can make and having confidence against their zone.”
The weekend will also mark the last home series to be played at Lavietes Pavilion by several outgoing leaders, including co-captains Destiny Nunley and Taylor Finley, and senior guard Grace Keane.
But they realize there are still tasks to complete.
“This still feels like a normal week,” senior co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “We still want to dominate. I am really excited and I think it will be two fantastic matchups.”
For the Crimson, victories against both Princeton and Penn this weekend would provide a boost of momentum heading into the Ivy League tournament, but successfully doing so will not be easy.
Harvard will need its best play from all facets of the court to hold back two teams who are just as hungry for a good end to the regular season.
The playoffs are a new and welcomed opportunity to reset the record, but first the team wants to end its season on a warm note.
“I think the tournament gives us a whole new opportunity,” Nunley said. “Before that, we just want to attack what we have forward and finish strong.”
