After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a blowout of historic proportions, the Harvard men’s basketball team (7-2) looks to rebound Sunday (2 p.m. EST, PAC-12 Network) against the Arizona State Sun Devils (7-5) in its third chance for a marquee nonconference victory. Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard starts the second half of its nonconference schedule.
Bouncing Back: Harvard’s 76-27 loss to Virginia last time out was the Crimson’s second-worst of the Tommy Amaker era and by far its most putrid offensive performance of the season. Starting backcourt Wesley Saunders, Agunwa Okolie, and Siyani Chambers combined to go 0-24 from the field and combined for just five points in the game. Chambers had his worst game of his career, missing all 10 shots and not registering a single assist.
However, Amaker’s squad has historically been exceptionally resilient. The team last lost two consecutive games in March 2013, when back-to-back losses to Penn and Princeton had all but eliminated the Crimson from the conference race. A Princeton choke, in the form of back-to-back losses to Yale and Brown, gave Harvard the championship, and the Crimson memorably notched its first-ever NCAA Tournament win two weeks later. Expect Harvard to reverse course on Sunday.
Home Sweet Home: Although the Sun Devils made the tournament last year for the first time since James Harden patrolled Wells Fargo Arena, the team has regressed this year. Arizona State has lost five of its last nine contests and does not have a win over a top-100 KenPom squad. Despite a 6-1 record at home, the squad is a pedestrian 1-4 away from the friendly confines of Tempe—almost a perfect reflection of Harvard’s 6-0/1-2 home/away split. Over the last two years, the Sun Devils are 23-2 at home but have won just six of 21 contests on the road.
Wes Side Story: No player was more conspicuously absent in the loss to Virginia than Saunders, a fringe Wooden Award candidate who came into the contest averaging more than 20 points a game. Virginia coach Tony Bennett instructed his players to stay on the ground and not bite at any of Saunders’ myriad head and ball fakes in the lane, forcing the senior wing into his worst shooting night of the season. Sunday, Saunders may be matched up with Devils wing Shaquiell McKissic, who averages 10.5 points and 4.9 rebounds a game himself. McKissic, neither the foul shooter (54 percent) nor distributor (1.8 assists a game) that Saunders is, will pose problems for the stiff Harvard interior defense. If Saunders can contain him as he did UMass guard Derrick Gordon, while providing his usual scoring punch, Harvard will be able to bounce back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball’s offense: better, but still not good enough.
Following last week’s historically bad 76-27 loss to No. 6 Virginia, the Crimson outpaced that output by halftime but scored just 18 second-half points in a 56-46 loss at Arizona State on Sunday.
Asked about his team’s offense, Harvard (7-3) coach Tommy Amaker was blunt.
“Not very good,” he said, “It’s obvious that we are struggling.”
Sophomore guard Corbin Miller cut the Sun Devil (8-5) lead to one, 38-37, five minutes into the second half, but Harvard managed to score just two points over the following six minutes as ASU opened up an eight-point lead.
With 4:32 left, Chambers launched a three that would have cut the gap to four points, but the shot caromed out and led to a transition alley-oop moments later that put the Sun Devils up nine. Ultimately, Harvard went without a made field goal over the game’s final seven minutes.
“Down the stretch it was tough,” Saunders aid. “They locked in on defense. They’re a good team so they knew they had to get some stops and they were able to do that, and we weren’t able to manufacture the offense.”
Saunders and Chambers were the only Crimson scorers in double figures with 15 and 10, respectively. ASU had four players reach 10 points, with 13 apiece coming from forward Shaquielle McKissic and guard Gerry Blakes.
In the loss, Harvard was held under 50 points in consecutive games for the first time since Amaker came to Cambridge.
“We’re getting great shots…they just haven’t gone,” Chambers said. “We just have to keep taking them.”
The offense’s opportunities were limited due to 14 turnovers and just five offensive rebounds, and Crimson shooters converted just 36 percent of the shots they did get off. Harvard had just seven assists in the game.
“Seven assists to 14 turnovers for us is just the opposite of what you’d like to have as a minimum,” Amaker said.
The Crimson’s free-throw struggles continued too. After converting just nine of 22 attempts at UVA, Harvard went 9-for-15 from the line Sunday.
“We have to do a better job,” Amaker said.  “We didn’t finish around the rim; we had moments where we could make layups and we didn’t. I’m disappointed in that.”
Saunders led what was nearly a two-man offensive show in the first half, utilizing drives, step-backs, and turnarounds to tally 13 first-half points. Chambers chipped in 10 in the first 20 minutes.
But Saunders had just two second-half points. Afterwards, Amaker mentioned that his leading scorer might have been hampered by cramps and that Harvard is in trouble when Saunders finishes a game with zero foul shots, as he did Sunday. Other players need to step up when opponents focus on Saunders, Amaker added.
“People have keyed on [Saunders], and we get chances to finish some dropoffs that he gives us or get to the foul line and convert from there—that’s what we have to cash in on,” he said.
Only six Harvard field goals came from players not named Chambers or Saunders. Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi was just 1-for-7 in the game and is now shooting 23 percent (9-for-40) in December. He finished last year shooting 54 percent from the field.
The Sun Devils shot 41 percent thanks in part to 10 blocks by Harvard defenders. Moundou-Missi led the way on that front with four rejections while six other players each contributed one.
The Crimson defense, which also forced 16 turnovers, helped keep ASU from pulling away for most of the game, but the Sun Devils kept returning to the paint and ultimately overpowered Harvard’s backline, more than doubling the Crimson’s point total in the lane.
“I’m sure it was part of their game plan to go inside against us,” Amaker said. “They got the ball to the rim and attacked the paint, and we didn’t do a good enough job defending it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a three-week layoff, the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s ice hockey team picked up right where it left off.
The Crimson (9-1-2, 5-1-2 ECAC) returned from the holiday break Sunday night for an exhibition match at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Playing in front of a home crowd for the first time in over a month, the team won its seventh straight game, shutting out the Russian Red Stars, 4-0.
The Red Stars, currently in the middle of their fifth annual American tour, are an all-star team made up of 17-to-21-year-old players from the MHL—a junior hockey league consisting of 39 teams, 32 of which come from Russia.
"There was a bit of a language barrier," sophomore forward Tyler Moy said. "If you're trying to talk to them, you can't do so with full expectation that they'll know what you're saying. [But] I think culturally it was a cool experience playing against players that you don't [typically] play against."
One night after falling to Yale, 2-1, in its tour opener, the Russian squad failed to score against the goaltending tandem of junior Steve Michalek and freshman Merrick Madsen. Michalek, who ranks third in the nation in save percentage (.944) and fifth in goals against average (1.72), made ten saves over the first two periods.
Then Madsen, a sixth round draft pick by the Philadelphia Flyers, made his Harvard debut in the third period, stopping all nine shots that came his way.
In total, the Red Stars mustered 19 shots on goal—the same number recorded by the Crimson, but only Harvard could capitalize on its opportunities. With Sunday’s performance, the Crimson has now scored at least four goals in four consecutive games.
Although the exhibition does not count toward Harvard’s record or statistics, junior forward Jimmy Vesey kept a streak of his own alive as well. Entering the contest with at least a point in each of the team’s opening 12 games, Vesey got on the score sheet at the 13:31 mark of the first period.
Leading 1-0, the Crimson earned its first power play of the night following a cross-checking penalty against the Red Stars’ Kirill Ablaev. Harvard won the ensuing faceoff, leading to a slap shot just inside the blue line from sophomore forward Tyler Moy.
Creating traffic in front of Russian goaltender Nikita Bogdanov, Vesey—who was also the one to get the puck to Moy—made sure to finish the job. The junior lifted his stick in the air and redirected Moy’s shot into the back of the net to provide the Crimson with some insurance.
Harvard got on the board in similar fashion earlier in the frame. Just seconds after killing off the first of five opportunities with an extra man for the Red Stars, the Crimson launched a counter-attack.
After Harvard missed an initial chance in transition, the puck squirted out to freshman defenseman Wiley Sherman, who wound up for a slap shot from close to the same spot as Moy. Stationed near the front of the net, fellow rookie Seb Lloyd deflected Sherman’s shot past Bogdanov to put the Crimson ahead.
Although the score will not officially count in the stat books, the goal is the first of Lloyd’s collegiate career. The freshman also picked up an assist in the game, feeding junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo on a two-on-one with 2:25 remaining in the second period.
Also getting on the scoreboard for the first time was freshman defenseman Thomas Aiken. Making his first appearance of the season, the walk-on took a pass from senior forward Tommy O’Regan and blasted it past Bogdanov from the blue line to cap the scoring.
With this game in the books, Harvard now shifts its attention to the second half of its schedule, as it looks to maintain its position atop the ECAC standings in 2015. In the meantime, Moy says that the scrimmage was a great experience for his team.
"Usually in college hockey you know most of the players on the other team," Moy said. "In this case, obviously it was very different. It was very cool playing against international players."
The exhibition also saw sophomore defenseman Kevin Guiltinan, who has been battling a back injury throughout the year, return to the ice for the first time in six weeks.
Two skaters who did not suit up for the Crimson were sophomore forwards Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone, who combined for two goals and four assists in Harvard’s 9-3 victory over the Red Stars last season.
While Kerfoot’s status remains unclear, Malone is expected back in the lineup when the Crimson resumes conference play against RPI on Tuesday.
