After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
D. E. Lorraine Sterritt, a former administrator at the College, will return from Stanford University this semester to serve as the Harvard College dean for administration, effective February 10.
Sterritt will be replacing Georgene B. Herschbach, who accepted the early retirement incentive package for staff offered last spring—vacating the post of dean for administration and concluding nearly three decades of service at Harvard. Herschbach will remain on campus to facilitate the process of her successor’s transition, according to Sterritt.
But come February, Sterritt will not find herself on wholly unfamiliar ground. She served as assistant dean of freshmen and associate dean of freshmen for academic affairs in the Freshman Dean’s Office from 1996 to 2000. Sterritt was also a lecturer on romance languages and literatures.
After her time at Harvard, she departed to become the dean of freshman and director of academic advising at the University of Pennsylvania. Sterritt has since worked at Stanford University, where she will be leaving her most recent post as associate dean for graduate and undergraduate studies in the School for Humanities and Sciences.
The newest addition to Sterritt’s resume—the College deanship for administration—was originally created for Herschbach in the summer of 2008 as administrative support for then-incoming Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. At the time, Hammonds sought to mirror the administrative framework of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which includes an analogous position currently held by FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79.
Sterritt said that her work at Stanford has given her experience in bridging the realms of student life and academia—an asset that will boost her efforts to fulfill Hammond’s hope for closer cooperation between the College and FAS.
“I really admire how Harvard integrates the academic and the residential,” said Sterritt, whose primary responsibility will be College affairs but is nevertheless expected to work with her counterparts in FAS.
“Lorraine will be a key partner for me and my team,” Kirwan wrote in an e-mailed statement.
In a statement announcing Sterritt’s return to Harvard, Hammonds wrote that Sterritt would work with senior administrators, faculty, and operational managers in the College and across the University to “promote the successful integration of academic, residential, and extracurricular life in the College.”
While Sterritt looks forward to overseeing House renovations and rethinking house life, she acknowledged that the budgetary component of her job would be at the forefront of her work, and that she was prepared to tackle this priority.
“That’s kind of my niche—how one orchestrates the financial angle to support, in the best possible way, the academic mission,” Sterritt said. “What we’ve tried to do at Stanford—insofar as it is possible—is to make the budget cuts invisible to students.”
Returning to Harvard after nearly a decade, Sterritt said she will have to acclimate not only to the colder climate, but to the new faces around campus.
For now, the Irish native is preparing for yet another long distance move: “I just put on some good music and get cracking on the packing,” she said.
Sterritt’s arrival comes in the wake of the departures of several key College administrators. In addition to Herschbach, Former Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith H. Kidd accepted the staff retirement package offered by the University last spring. Former Associate Dean of Advising Programs Monique Rinere departed at the end of the last academic year to take a post at Columbia.
The announcement of the departures preceded the creation in the fall of 2009 of the Office of Student Life—the consolidation of the College’s Office of Residential Life and Office of Student Life and Activities. The move, which involved cutting five staff positions, would “streamline support for our undergraduates,” Hammonds had said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time this season, the Harvard men’s hockey team is on a winning streak.
The Crimson (4-10-2, 4-5-2 ECAC) continued to break out of its early-season slump with its second-straight victory this afternoon, taking it to Dartmouth (4-13-0, 2-8-0) in a 4-1 conference win at Bright Hockey Center.
“It was a great game for us,” freshman Louis Leblanc said. “I don’t think we played our best hockey, but we got out of here with two points…It feels good to put two together. Obviously we’ve got things to work on, but it feels good right now.”
Leblanc once again sparked Harvard’s offensive effort, scoring twice to become the first Crimson skater in almost seven years to record back-to-back multi-goal games. He was aided by linemates sophomore Alex Killorn and junior Michael Biega, each of whom had two points on the afternoon.
“I think our whole line’s clicking,” Leblanc said. “We know each other, we’re all skilled guys, we like to work hard, and we’re just moving the puck right now.”
Leblanc opened the scoring less than five minutes into the game off a good effort from Killorn. The sophomore skated up the right and put a shot on net. Big Green goalie Jody O’Neill deflected the puck, but Leblanc picked up the rebound and went top-shelf to light the lamp.
But Dartmouth did not fold easily, battling through two first-period penalties and outshooting Harvard, 27-18, through two frames. A Big Green goal six minutes into the second seemed to shift the momentum squarely in Dartmouth’s favor.
The Big Green caught sophomore defender Ryan Grimshaw in a 3-on-1 rush, and Matt Reber’s cross to Evan Stephens was buried to tie the game.
Though Dartmouth dominated the next seven minutes of play, it couldn’t break through on a mid-period power play, and just after the advantage expired, Leblanc took matters into his own hands.
Biega chipped the puck up to his linemate along the right boards, and Leblanc sped through the Big Green zone before wristing a shot past O’Neill into the upper left corner of the net.
“Second period, I thought the first 10 minutes [Dartmouth was] really playing well and taking it to us a little bit,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “Our second goal, I think, really kind of changed the game.”
It took less than two minutes for Harvard to extend its advantage.
The all-junior fourth line of Matt McCollem, Michael Del Mauro, and Pier-Olivier Michaud, which played tough, physical hockey all afternoon, created a chance with just over five minutes left in the second.
Michaud fed the puck to Del Mauro, who was streaking up center ice. Del Mauro passed the puck off to his left to McCollem, who beat O’Neill to make the score 3-1.
“I thought Del Mauro was a factor,” Donato said. “I think physically he was great on the forecheck, made great decisions with the puck, made a nice pass to Matty McCollem. And I think Matty can be a difference-maker for us.”
The quick pair of goals spurred Big Green coach Bob Gaudet to make a change in net, swapping O’Neill for rookie James Mello.
“I wanted to get a little bit of a spark, a little change,” Gaudet explained. “James came in and did a good job for us, made a couple of really good saves for us…It didn’t work for us, necessarily, but again I thought our guys battled really hard.”
Harvard entered the third period with a two-goal advantage, but the final frame has been one in which the Crimson has struggled of late. This time, Harvard’s defense held up to the challenge.
“I thought we did the things we needed to do to make it tough for them to come back—stayed out of the box, we were good with the puck, and continued to get good offensive chances,” Donato said.
After Dartmouth pulled Mello with 3:03 to play in the game, the Crimson’s first line once again capitalized on its opportunity.
Killorn broke away toward the net, and though his attempt was broken up by a Big Green defender, he played the puck to a charging Biega, who put the puck into the empty net to extend the lead to 4-1.
Although Harvard’s offense put the game out of reach, the defense, backstopped by junior Ryan Carroll, gave the Crimson its second-consecutive win while being outshot by its opponent.
After watching most of the early season from the bench, Carroll made 37 saves in his second-straight start.
“I think Ryan played well again,” Donato said. “I think he looks very calm in net, doesn’t give up a lot of rebounds, plays the puck well.”
The win moves Harvard into eighth place in the ECAC as it prepares to travel to league-leading Union on Friday.
“We’re learning how to win hockey games,” Donato said. “With some confidence, with some wins, hopefully we’ll continue to improve, and by the end of the season we’ll put it all together.”
