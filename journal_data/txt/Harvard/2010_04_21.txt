After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard students received an e-mail notifying them of the new opportunity to apply for borrowing privileges at several of MIT’s libraries. Correct us if we’re wrong, but this veritable “meeting of the minds” could lead to a whole lot more than book sharing. Honestly, it’s about time that these two prestigious institutions recognized the power they could possess if they joined forces—pooling everything in an effort to dominate the People’s Republic in which they currently battle for power. We expect that our access to these sacred stacks could very well open the door to a new era in history, where the joint force of MIT and Harvard would conquer first the local Cambridge domicile, then the slightly larger continental United States, and, eventually, the world in its entirety. They say knowledge is power, right?
This Harvard-MIT (Marvard? HIT?) partnership would clearly benefit both parties involved. For instance, we could party away in MIT’s marginally better social space! It’s not like those frats are currently getting much use, anyway—and Harvard would really be doing MIT a service by providing bodies to fill them up. On the subject of students Harvard could send over to MIT, we’re pretty sure that our ivy-covered institution would be willing to part with some of its female undergraduates to even out the gender ratio a little further down Mem Drive. MIT men would undoubtedly be thrilled—and Harvard girls have a better shot at some female-dominated social space over there (although they might miss shivering outside of final clubs as “gentlemen” give them the up-down). Overall, a win-win situation for all involved.
Although Harvard administrators would have probably declined to comment had we bothered to contact them, we feel confident that the University would graciously share some of its sports prowess, athleticism, and surplus “bro” culture with our neighbors down the way. In exchange, MIT could provide Harvard with a J-Term that is, well, more than just a “J-cation.” We could also benefit from MIT’s computer-nerd skills, which have clearly paid off in terms of the institution’s web design and e-mail interface. Maybe their technicians could take a crack at the Stone Age-style Faculty of Arts and Sciences account, which has been known to black out after more than 15 emails accrue in an inbox. In return for these benefits, Harvard could provide a team of artists to rethink the “jailbreak chic” aesthetic of MIT’s campus. At the very least, a bunch of Visual and Environmental Studies concentrators could paint red bricks and the weather-worn sheen of centuries onto the cold, drab stone. Finally, to seal the deal, Harvard could throw in some deodorant. They certainly could use it.
Lord Acton said that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. To that end, we eagerly anticipate the fruits of this merger. Mwahahahaha!
CORRECTION: June 14, 2010
 
An earlier version of the Apr. 21 opinion piece "Harvard Needs Books" stated that Machiavelli said that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. In fact, Lord Acton originated that quote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The announcement passed fairly quietly a few weeks ago: Next spring, students will be asked to pre-register for courses months before classes begin. Their selections will remain non-binding, but they will give the College a clearer sense of who will take what class going into shopping week.
This is a step in the right direction toward curing the large logistical flaws caused by shopping period. But it doesn’t go far enough to make course selection easier on everyone involved. The best solution is to scrap Harvard’s peculiar institution entirely. That’s right; shopping period needs to go.
As it is today, shopping is incredibly inefficient. The registrar seems to have a knack for wrongly guessing a given class’s enrollment, leading to a complex room reshuffle during the first week. In addition, many classes must scramble to find extra Teaching Fellows, a slow process that can delay sectioning and the syllabus. These TFs are also frequently underqualified, drawn from a subdiscipline barely relevant to the class. The current pre-registration plan hopes to cut down on this initial chaos—which cost Harvard one million dollars last year—but eliminating shopping would end it definitively.
It’s an open secret that many professors and administrators dislike shopping, but its demise would bring clear benefits to students as well. For example, the Coop would never be without a book you need because it would know exactly how many to order. In fact, the Coop’s prices are already so steep in part because they don’t know how many books they will be able to sell—so they insure their profit with a higher price tag.
Pre-registration would also eliminate the need for the lotteries that constantly shatter students’ plans the day before study cards are due. Under pre-registration, gone would be the pressure of unearthing a fourth class at the 11th hour. Personally, I find this the most compelling argument against shopping: For me, the most stressful week of the year isn’t reading period, and it’s not exam period; it’s shopping period. In course selection as in life, ignorance of what’s ahead is far scarier than even the most dreaded known commodity.
For all these costs, shopping period doesn’t even return a benefit—only a perceived one. If the claim is that pre-registration will result in more dissatisfaction with classes, we should remember that shopping is imperfect as well: Very few students can say that they have liked every single class they have taken at Harvard. Pre-registering would not lead to a rash of unhappiness any more than it has at the thousands of other schools with no shopping week—many of which are notoriously happier than we are.
But there’s still valuable information to be gleaned from shopping, right? There is information, all right, but almost none of it is reliable. You don’t need a scientific study to show that first impressions are often inaccurate, and it’s no secret that professors gussy up their first week of lectures to attract more students. The only real truth to be gained is the professor’s lecturing ability (a poor instructor usually can’t just conjure up superb rhetorical skills for a week). That might be something, but it’s far from the only factor that goes into taking a class. In fact, lecturing ability is far from the only factor that goes into a professor’s teaching ability. The guy may be great to listen to, but he may not grade fairly, answer his e-mail, or be a generally responsible human being. The best way to know this is to ask the people who have taken the class before—in other words, to check the Q Guide.
Instead, though, shopping puts too much weight on the one criterion of charisma. Students should be making their decisions on more overriding considerations, like their interest in the subject. Conveniently, these are considerations that a student can research through a medium other than shopping. The reading list? That’s online. Course goals? Also online, often in the same detail that the professor spends on it for an hour on the first day. “Does this class have a midterm?” Why, yes, if you had looked online, you’d know that, now, wouldn’t you?
Instead, shopping encourages students to show up to a class uninformed and ask such questions, whose answers are plainly available on the syllabus. Like shopping week as a whole, it’s a waste of teachers’ time and ours—except unlike shopping week, at least it doesn’t actually harm us in the process. Shopping period may once have been useful, it’s true—back in the days before syllabi could be posted online or that questioner could e-mail the professor instead. But today, much more information beyond a one-paragraph course description can and must be made available several months before a semester begins. We should take advantage of that—and abolish the shopping period that it has made obsolete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday, 32 players will be picked in the first round of the 2010 National Football League Draft.  Although these men will most likely find success and celebrity in the near future, the quality of their health will begin to trend downward. During the past year, much has been made about the seriousness of head injuries suffered by football players and the support that the NFL provides for them in the aftermath. These discussions concern both long-retired players and those still taking the field today, and they reached a high point in Nov. 2009, when NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the two chairmen of the league’s brain injury committee had resigned. This announcement came just one month after Goodell faced questioning from the House Judiciary Committee in Oct. 2009.
The wave of criticism of the current league procedures have come both from high-profile players dealing with multiple concussions and from new research from the study of deceased football players’ brains. The facts from the latter are clear: Studies from the Center of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University suggest that there is a strong correlation between repetitive head trauma and accelerated rates of dementia,  and other studies link the number of concussions with a higher predisposition to depression. The question now revolves not around the validity of the harm of concussions in football but what to do about them.
Although former players may want the NFL to agree to cover the cost of psychological and medical care for retirees dealing with lagging head injuries, this only deals with the end result of the problem. Players and advocates are also searching for rule changes, but that, too, will only result in inadequate, quick fixes.
The reality of the entire situation is that American football is an extremely dangerous game. Although the NFL released a new list of rules that would “try to stay proactive” in protecting its players, no amount of yellow flags, yardage penalties, or player fines can stop serious injuries from taking place. The game of football and its players have evolved to such a stage of speed and strength that physicists calculate that an average-sized player can deliver over 1600 pounds of force in a single tackle. This is not a game that can be “injury proofed.”
The missing piece in all of these discussions, therefore, is not the league, but the players. This is the case from seasoned veterans to eager rookies, from professionals to peewees. Just as construction workers and deep-sea fishermen do, the men who are entering a season or a career in football must face the inherent danger of that decision. Although the NFL is an industry and a business, it cannot and should not assume responsibility for the havoc wreaked upon the bodies of its employees, who have a choice whether or not to partake in its violence.
The physical and mental well-being of the players are important, and the league should strive within reason to make its product safer. But in the end, the gridiron can never be kind to the body. Professional sports are crucially different from construction or deap-sea fishing, both of which deal with worksite injuries as a necessary evil. The goal and practice of these latter jobs is not to be harmed, whereas serious contact is a part of football’s standard operating procedure.
Does this mean that football should not be played at all or that any sign of pain should bring a player to the sidelines? No, and no. What must take place, not just in football but across the sporting world, is for players to exercise personal responsibility over when and how long they compete. This should be the case for all injuries but especially in the case of head trauma. A team’s medical staff is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of injuries, but the player must know the risks involved and be able to make the tough decision of sitting out a big game or staying off of the field for the fourth quarter. This method has been practiced sparingly, the early retirement of Tiki Barber being one lonely example.
The grit and toughness of many NFL players is admirable, but although we can marvel at their on-screen and on-field bravery, we cannot excuse them from any responsibility for wheel chairs and brain damage later in life. The physicality of football is what defines it and makes it thrilling, but players must gauge and consider the repercussions of a lifetime of hits. Ideally, behind the smiles of tomorrow’s draftees, there will have been a great deal of thought about the career choice they have just made.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No concept gets quite as much abuse in American politics as partisanship. Those in power love to blame it for stopping legislation from advancing. When Senator Jim Bunning shut down the Senate to prevent a bill extending unemployment benefits from going forward, the White House blasted the action as “blatant, partisan obstructionism.” The opposition in turn attacks as “partisan” the legislation it obstructs.  In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announcing their opposition to financial reform, members of the Senate Republican Caucus declared: “We are united in our opposition to the partisan legislation reported by the Senate Banking Committee.”
The use of “partisan” as an epithet is rooted in two impulses. The first is the common perception that the electorate finds partisanship unsavory; the second is that it prevents Congress from getting things done. As President Obama put it to a House Republican retreat in January, “I don’t think [the American people] want more gridlock. I don’t think they want more partisanship,” with the connection between the two left unexamined.
Neither of these ideas, however, holds up to much scrutiny. The voters certainly say they want politicians to be less partisan. Polls show that majorities of Americans think Republicans and Democrats in Congress—as well as the Obama administration—should make more of an effort to work across party lines. This is curious, given that voters’ behavior is just as partisan as that of their representatives in Congress. The popular idea that there is a large group of swing voters representing the true will of the country is, by most metrics, false. The number of independent voters who actually change their minds in elections hovers around and below 10 percent of the electorate, sneaking a little above that in 2008. The rest of the electorate is composed of Democrats, Republicans, and independents who behave exactly like Democrats and Republicans. Although I’m sure this small group genuinely wants more bipartisan cooperation, I’m less sure that actual partisans, and may-as-well-be partisans, actually feel the same way.
But let’s trust poll results for a minute and conclude that partisans and partisan independents do actually want their representatives to work with the other party and that they don’t just bash partisanship when asked because “working together” sounds nice. If partisan loyalties were relaxed, would these partisans actually get what they want?
Let’s say these partisans attack partisanship because they want less gridlock. This is an attractive notion, especially with a Senate GOP using its strong party discipline to block most legislation in its tracks. But if one considers the history of health-care reform, it was actually an absence of party discipline that dragged the process on longer. Before the passage of the Senate bill, it was not an unwillingness of the Democrats and Republicans to work together that delayed the bill. It was the complaints of two senators in the Democratic caucus—Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman—about the bill’s abortion language and its inclusion of a public option that kept it from being finished. Similarly, during the final passage of the bill in the House last month, the struggle was not to craft a bipartisan compromise. It was to get a group of renegade Democratic congressmen, led by Bart Stupak, to support the bill in spite of its abortion language. Were there more party discipline in either body, the bill would have passed much faster as Democratic legislators fell in line. Instead, weak party identification held the bill up for an absurd length of time.
For a comparison, consider what would have happened in a developed country with more typical levels of party discipline. For example, in the United Kingdom, with the exception of occasional “free votes” having to do with religious and cultural issues, members of Parliament are expected to vote with their party. If they do not, the party has the power to, without a primary election, strip the member of his place in the next election. A British Bart Stupak, then, could not have credibly threatened to vote against health-care reform, unless he was willing to give up his political career or switch parties to do so.  The process would have gone more quickly and included fewer carve-outs.
Similarly, those who hate earmarks, and other special deals for the states and districts of members of Congress, ought to embrace party discipline by the same logic. Now, members can threaten to vote against a piece of legislation unless a kickback is included, and the leadership has every reason to take them seriously. If the leadership had the power to prevent the reelection of members who vote against the party’s agenda, holding legislation hostage like this would not be possible.
It is comforting to think of bipartisan governance as a clean, cooperative process. In reality, however, it is far slower and dirtier than a process with strong party discipline. If one wants Congress to get things done with a minimum of corruption, enforcing party discipline is the place to start.

In light of the increasing number of LGBT families, the definition of the family ought to be reevaluated, Family Equality Council Executive Director Jennifer Chrisler said at an LGBT family planning panel yesterday.
Chrisler noted that over 80 percent of LGBT Americans expect to get married and have children—“a dramatic shift” from the 45 percent of lesbian women who planned to have children in the 1980s.
“Imagine a government that supported education and funding around creating and sustaining healthy families that have nothing to do with structure and everything to do with how the family spends time together,” she said at the panel, which was held at the Law School yesterday.
The four featured panelists said that though the U.S. is still far from equalizing both legal and medical considerations for LGBT families, significant progress has been made in the past 20 years.
They discussed the many different ways LGBT couples can have children, from legal adoption to medical options like surrogacy and egg or sperm donations.
“Adoption is always a challenging experience,” said panelist and new adoptive father Graham T. McMahon, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Kids from state adoptions have a lot of medical and psychosocial needs, and a lot of private agencies are happy to take your money and never present your profile to birth moms.”
The panelists said that sperm and egg donors as well as surrogates—women who agree to carry and give birth to a baby for other parents—have made it possible for more LGBT couples to start families.
Yet finding a surrogate or donor, as well as paying for these often intricate legal and medical procedures, can add extra burdens for LGBT parents.
“If you’re serious about planning a family, you really need to start financial planning early,” said Samuel C. Pang, medical director of the Reproductive Science Center of New England. “With agency fees, legal fees, and paying for a surrogate or donor, you start tucking away early.”
Chrisler said that it is important for LGBT parents to address their sexuality with their children as early as possible.
“Anytime you pass over an opportunity to talk about why your kid has two dads or two moms, you’re asking your child to keep a secret, and secrets are bad for kids,” she said. “You need to be as out as you possibly can be before you start a family.”
The panel was organized by the LGBT groups at the Medical School and the Law School, the Kinsey 2-6ers and HLS Lambda, respectively. The event was integrated into Harvard’s first University-wide recognition of Gaypril—a month dedicated to celebrating LGBT rights and raising awareness.

An audience divided between women and apparent jocks crowded Fong Auditorium to attend a talk by Michael Kimmel, a researcher on men and masculinity and the author of “Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men.”
As audience members passed up open seats to stand in the back of the auditorium, Kimmel noted that a number of men were sitting with empty seats between them.
“It’s like how guys always go to the movies and leave two seats between them,” he said. “Why do they do that? Because they don’t want anybody to think they may be to-ge-ther.”
Kimmel said that being perceived as gay is the ultimate challenge to masculinity.
“All of male behavior is constantly policed and scrutinized to make sure it doesn’t look gay,” he said. “Young men are desperate to prove their masculinity, and they often do it in high risk-taking ways.”
He said that the modern emergence of young adulthood, or “adultolescence,” has created a culture in which men assert their masculinity in ways that deepen gender inequality.
He said that in spite of progress toward gender equality from factors like economic change, new trends in parenting, longer lifespans, and the women’s movement, men—and especially white, middle-class, college-educated men—often continue to express themselves as superior.
Audience members noted that the talk seemed to overstate the prevalence of such homophobic and womanizing behavior.
“His talk was focused on what’s going on with guys smack-dab in the middle of Guyland, which doesn’t strike me as a comprehensive picture of all the men in this age range,” said Gina Helfrich, assistant director of the Harvard College Women’s Center. “Still, I think it’s important research because the experience of this privileged group has an impact on everybody else.”
Kimmel also addressed how to put an end to sexual assault.
“We need to bring men into this, and I have this idea how,” he said, reaching for a round piece of rubber with holes in it.
“It’s a urinal thing!” he exclaimed, noting that the “thing,” technically called a splashguard, could serve a social role by being emblazoned with the message, “You hold the power to stop rape in your hand.”
“Once you’re laughing, your defenses are down, so you actually have to think about it,” Sigma Chi brother Joshua D. Foote ’10 said of Kimmel’s suggested tactic to prevent sexual assault.
Foote added that he appreciated Kimmel’s focus on the social rather than legal implications of stopping sexual assault.
“What we need is societal change in the perception of what manhood is,” he said.
The talk, which was part of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response’s Sexual Assault Awareness Month, was sponsored by several male groups on campus: Sigma Chi Fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, the Owl Club, the Asian American Brotherhood, and the Harvard football team.

Harvard School of Public Health Professor Donald M. Berwick ’68 was nominated by President Barack Obama on Monday to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
If confirmed by the Senate, Berwick would be the first permanent administrator for the Centers since the position became vacant in 2006, according to Bloomberg.
Berwick, who is also the president and chief executive officer of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, said in a statement that he felt “flattered and humbled” by Monday’s announcement.
“If confirmed by the [U.S.] Senate, I would welcome the opportunity to lead CMS because it offers the chance to help extend the effort to improve America’s health care system,” Berwick said in the statement.
“I have never felt more excited about what is possible for what we all care about—a healthier nation, a healthier system of care, and a healthier world.”
Berwick’s nomination to lead the CMS—which had been in the works since last month—is not his first presidential nomination.
In 1997, Berwick was appointed by former President William J. Clinton to serve on the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Healthcare Industry.
“He has been a tremendous leader, not just for IHI, but also for the entire field of health care improvement,” said A. Blanton Godfrey, IHI’s board chairman, in a statement.
“If confirmed, his talents will be enormously valuable to the federal government at a time when the future of our health care system is inextricably linked to the future health of the American people and the US economy.”
Berwick is currently a clinical professor of pediatrics and health care policy.
He is also a pediatrician, an associate at Children’s Hospital in Boston, and a consultant at Massachusetts General Hospital.

For the past eight years, Sanjay Kansagra has wanted to open a fast food Indian restaurant that sells frankies—meat and vegetable wraps that can be purchased freshly-made on the streets of Mumbai.
Since his Subway franchise moved into The Garage over a year ago, Kansagra had been waiting for the perfect opportunity to expand in the food court.
In January, Flat Patties owner Tom Brush announced that his restaurant would be moving out of The Garage and onto Brattle Street. Kansagra saw his opportunity.
Last week, Kansagra finally received his site license to take over the space Flat Patties left behind in The Garage. He said that he plans to open his new restaurant—Chutneys—during the first week of June.
The menu, which is still being developed, will have a variety of options, including chicken chilli, Indian bread, and lamb kabobs, and customers will be able to choose among many different sauces—the inspiration for the restaurant’s name.Like his Subway store just a few yards away, Kansagra said Chutneys’ prices will average around $5 to $6.
“It should be reasonably priced, it should be fast, and the customers should have a choice for what flavors they want [it] to be,” Kansagra said of Chutneys’ food.
Executive Director for the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson said that the association is looking forward to this new venture because Kansagra is already a community partner.
“He’s done a very good job satisfying lots of students. He has a very good sense of what students are looking for,” Jillson said. “He understands that they are all on a schedule, and he understand that he has to have good food and healthy food that is prepared quickly, so he understand what he has to bring to this restaurant.”
In addition to Kansagra’s recognition of how to cater to students’ needs, Jillson said she likes another aspect of the new restaurant.
“I think the name [Chutneys] is kind of cute,” she said.

People gain more willpower to do good after performing a good deed, according to a recent Harvard study.
Psychology graduate student Kurt J. Gray found that people who chose to donate a dollar rather than keep it had greater physical endurance.
“To be good and feel the positive effects, you just have to do some good,” he said. “You don’t have to donate a whole kidney. You can just donate a dollar.”
Gray stopped random passersby in Harvard Square and put a weight in their hands, asking them to hold it for as long as they could. He then handed them a dollar and told them they could either keep it or donate it to charity. After he gave them the weights again, those who donated the dollar were able to hold the weight longer than those who did not donate the dollar.
In a variation of the first study, Gray gave a weight to passersby and told them to hold it for as long as they could in one hand while writing a story with their other hand about themselves doing something heroic, neutral, or evil.
The subjects who wrote about themselves doing good held the weight much longer than those who wrote about themselves doing something neutral. But the subjects who wrote about themselves doing something evil were able to hold the weight longest of all.
“It takes willpower to do something good,” Gray said. “It takes even more to do something evil, for then you have to crush something in your conscience.”
“If you make the decision, you start seeing yourself as good, and then you start becoming your own mold that you just set for yourself,” he added.
Psychology Professor Joshua D. Greene ’97 said that he found the study’s results to be interesting.
“How you behave affects how you see yourself, which then influences your subsequent behavior,” he explained. “It really shows how conception informs reality.”

Harvard has maintained its place among the best graduate schools in the U.S. News and World Report’s rankings of top graduate schools, which were released late last week.
Harvard Medical School was listed as the best research medical school, Harvard Business School tied with Stanford for the top spot among business schools, and Harvard Law School once again took second place below Yale Law School.
The recently released rankings show little signs of change among the top graduate schools since last year, despite the shift in the U.S.’s financial situation.
Robin E. Mount, director of the Office of Career Services, said that although some young people may view graduate school as a way to sit out the financial crisis, students should think carefully before deciding to enroll, as graduate school is a personal experience and can cost a great deal of money.
The Harvard College Senior Survey data for the Classes of 2008 and 2009 indicates that the percentage of seniors who enrolled in graduate school right after graduation held steady at 21 percent for both class years.
While Harvard’s numbers have not changed, overall, the application process has become more competitive, according to Mount.
She said that students should choose the graduate school that is the best fit for their interests. According to Mount, there is little difference between the top schools and rankings should only play “a medium role” in one’s decision as to where to enroll.
Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, the Class of 2010’s first marshal, was accepted to several top-ranked medical schools and is currently deciding which one to attend. He said that the U.S. News rankings played a role in where he decided to apply, but he also relied on his personal experience and professors’ advice.
Ayogu said that he has been examining the resources these medical schools have to offer and whether they include his main interests: health policy and basic science.
“I didn’t want to apply to any schools that wouldn’t offer me both,” he said.

Donald B. Katz, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brandeis, discussed the relationship between taste and neurons at a seminar yesterday.
The hour-long talk, hosted by Harvard University Dining Service’s Food Literacy Project and the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, drew over 60 students to William James Hall, where they listened to Katz speak and had the opportunity to try a special food additive.
Katz explained how taste travels from taste receptors in the mouth to neurons in the brain.
“Most neurons delivering information to the brain do not respond only to sweet...or salty, but instead respond to a bunch of different tastes,” Katz said.
He also talked about how there are four universally recognized tastes—sweet, salty, sour, and bitter—but some scientists believe there is also a fifth taste.
“There’s a great controversy—admittedly, a great controversy in this field is like a tiny little controversy—about whether there are four or five tastes,” Katz said.
He explained that some scientists believe that there is a fifth taste called savory that is analogous to umami.
Katz said that this idea is particularly in vogue among Asian scientists who work in areas where umami is popular, like Japan.
Katz also gave a primer on “miracle fruit,” which makes both sweet and sour foods taste sweeter.
Some of the seminar’s hosts gave audience members tablets containing miraculin, the active molecule that gives miracle fruit its unique property.
“By the way, when you hear names like that, it’s basically code for we don’t know what the hell that is,” Katz quipped, referring to the word miraculin.
Students had the opportunity to try miraculin tablets with an assortment of fruits, chips, and kimchi.
The tablets were ordered from Amazon.com, according to Neurobiology concentrator Judith E. Fan ’10, who helped coordinate the event.
“Everything tastes so much sweeter,” said Qian “Amy” Huang ’13. “Lemons taste like lemonade.”
Brandeis graduate student Caitlin Pierre, Katz’s lab assistant, explained that miraculin can be used with a variety of items.
“It’s really interesting to do it with beer,” she said. “You do it with something like Guinness. It tastes really bitter—you put [the tablet] on your tongue and suddenly the Guinness tastes like a milkshake.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Quad will likely see an ATM installed at the Student Organization Center at Hilles by next September, the result of a year and a half of advocacy by the Undergraduate Council to improve safety and student life in the Quad.
According to tentative plans, an ATM run by the Harvard University Employees Credit Union will be installed in the SOCH over the summer, said Senan Ebrahim ’12, chair of the UC Student Life Committee.
Plans for the ATM have yet to be finalized, and among the details to be settled is the per-transaction service fee that HUECU plans to charge non-members for use of the machine, a common practice at ATMs. Ebrahim said that the fee is currently set to be $1.75 but added that in final talks the SLC will seek to reduce or eliminate it.
HUECU Vice President of Marketing Thomas Montilli and retail sales manager Marilyn J. Gambardella could not be reached for comment.
Placing an ATM in the Quad has long been a goal of the UC, especially for former UC presidential candidate George J. J. Hayward ’11, a Currier House resident who has sought to provide Quadlings with equal access to amenities available near the River Houses, such as ATMs and cell phone reception.
But the UC faced several challenges along the way, including identifying a bank that would be willing to install an ATM and undergoing a security review by the administration and the Harvard University Police Department to ensure the safety of putting an ATM in the Quad.
Hayward, an inactive Crimson editor, called the installation “a project that students really want in the Quad.”
“When I ran for the UC, I was very interested in enhancing Quad security, and I’m very glad that before I graduate I can see these projects come to fruition,” he said.

A new nicotine product that resembles candy has come under scrutiny for being linked to poisoning in young children.
According to a study conducted in part by the Harvard School of Public Health, infants are enticed by the sweet taste and candy-like appearance of Camel Orbs—but if ingested, the pellet can lead to poisoning and even death.
Released last year by the R.J. Reynolds Company, the dissolvable product contains one milligram of nicotine per pellet, and the Camel Strips version contains roughly three times as much. These levels can induce varying degrees of poisoning symptoms in children depending on the body weight of the child and the amount of dissolvable ingested, ultimately leading to severe—and possibly fatal—consequences.
“The smoking industry constantly comes out with new products, and they’re designed in a very appealing way,” said HSPH Professor Gregory N. Connolly, the study’s lead researcher. “Smokeless products are high up in the poisoning reporting list. With age, children’s taste functions develop, and they move toward more sweetened products.”
Public health officials also worry that this new generation of smokeless products will initiate future tobacco use among youth.
“In addition to poisoning our children, smokeless tobacco companies [like R.J. Reynolds] are addicting our teenagers,” said Danny McGoldrick, vice president of research at the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. “Philip Morris and the ‘big boys’ are getting into the smokeless industry, making these products easier to use for our children.”
Though there is currently no empirical evidence to link increases in youth smoking rates to the greater prevalence of compact and sweetened smokeless products, McGoldrick insists the two are related.
“We know that use of smokeless tobacco products has increased recently among high school students,” McGoldrick said. “Among 12th grade high school boys especially, we’ve seen use increase from back in 2006.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent suit against Goldman Sachs raises new questions about securities regulation from both legal and ethical standpoints, according to professors from Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.
The SEC alleged on Friday that Goldman misrepresented to investors, including financial institutions IKB and ACA Capital, the involvement of a major hedge fund in assembling a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities that the fund later bet against.
Goldman has denied the allegations and stated in a press release that it will “vigorously contest” the SEC’s charges.
According to Law School Professor Jesse M. Fried ’86, the question at the heart of the case is whether or not hedge fund manager John Paulson’s involvement in structuring the portfolio in 2006 was “material”—that is, significant to a buyer’s decision to purchase the securities.
Paulson has become well-known in financial circles for his negative outlook on the real estate market at the peak of the housing bubble and earned billions in 2007 in part by betting against mortgage-backed securities. IKB and ACA suffered significant losses on the portfolio.
The SEC would also need to prove that Goldman had a duty to disclose Paulson’s role, and that buyers incurred damages as a result of his involvement.
Business School professors said that the case raises important ethical issues, but that the legal grounding of the SEC’s suit is unclear.
Law School Professor Allen Ferrell noted that Paulson’s actions likely did not constitute wrongdoing, if the hedge fund was independently speculating on future market movements—which is not fraudulent behavior on its own.
But Business School Professor Michael D. Kimbrough questioned whether Paulson’s involvement could be considered proper business practice.
Kimbrough suggested that some people doubt whether the buyers’ decision to enter the transaction would have been impacted by the knowledge of Paulson’s strategy to short the securities, since Paulson had not yet gained recognition for his foresight on falling housing prices.
Additionally, Kimbrough said that under current statutes, financial institutions such as IKB and ACA are expected to research their own investments.
Business School professors said that greater transparency in derivative transactions could help prevent similar situations in the future.
Kimbrough said that current securities regulations are focused on protecting individuals from investment fraud rather than protecting financial institutions.
Bills regulating derivative exchanges are currently under review in the House and Senate, but Business School professor David A. Moss stressed that these new regulations, had they been in place at the time, may not have prevented the alleged fraud.
“Fraud is not 100 percent preventable, even with good regulation,” Moss warned.
Rebuidling and Preserving Reputation
The SEC may have a stake in regaining its credibility as a regulatory body, according to Law School professors.
“They are interested in trying to rehabilitate themselves,” said Fried, noting that the organization has suffered criticism for its handling of the Madoff fraud and the Bank of America litigations. “They have to show that they can shoot straight and that they have a role to play.”
Business School Professor Robin M. Greenwood said that Goldman is a “convenient target” for people who are looking for a scapegoat in the wake of the crisis.
For Goldman, reputation is also at stake, as well as the possibility of further legal actions on other transactions, Ferrell said. According to Law School Professor Howell E. Jackson, the SEC has a plausible case and Goldman will not be confident enough to go to trial. Ferrell, Jackson, and Fried said they believe that Goldman will settle.
But they acknowledged that much factual evidence has yet to be revealed.
“At the end of the day it will depend on the economic and legal merits of the case and rise and fall on that,” Ferrell said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 21, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 21 news article "Professors Discuss Goldman Suit" incorrectly attributed to Law School Professor Allen Ferrell the statement that hedge fund manager John Paulson's speculation on future market movements likely did not constitute wrongdoing. In fact, Ferrell said that if Paulson had only made independent speculations, then his actions would not constitute wrongdoing.

After his speaking engagement in Chennai, India last Thursday, Harvard Business School Professor Robert S. Kaplan planned to spend the weekend hiking in Switzerland before giving another speech in Frankfurt, Germany.
But after last week’s volcano eruption in Iceland made it impossible for him to fly to Germany, Kaplan instead ended up in Dubai—where the daytime temperature reached 100 degrees—with “a whole duffel bag full of warm weather hiking clothes,” he said.
Kaplan was among a handful of Harvard professors stranded across the Atlantic as a result of the April 14 volcanic eruption, many of whom have yet to return to Cambridge.
Last Wednesday, the volcano—locally known as Eyjafjallajökull—began spouting plumes of fragmented glass and ash into the air, which can knock out the engines of airliners. By the following day, countries across Europe had introduced restrictions grounding nearly all flights through Monday.
Physics Professor Gerald Gabrielse’s trip to north of the Arctic Circle in Finland to give the opening talk of a conference placed him “right in the path of the unexpected volcanic dust from Iceland,” he wrote in an e-mail to his quantum mechanics class.
“I took a 4 hour bus ride followed by a 12-hour, all-night train ride to get to Helsinki when my first flight was cancelled,” Gabrielse wrote. “However, the dust came roughly at the same speed and the Helsinki airport [was] closed.”
But Gabrielse, who is scheduled on a flight today, has managed to teach his course despite the ocean between him and his students.
With the support of the IT staff, Gabrielse organized a lecture via video link yesterday for his class in the Northwest Science Building.
Gabrielse even “called out a student for sleeping in class, from another continent,” said Yonatan J. Kogan ’12, another student in the class.
While most countries had lifted air restrictions by yesterday afternoon, the passengers still stranded are trying to make the best of their unexpected conditions.
While he was in Dubai, Kaplan said he had an offer to play golf over the weekend.
“But the only gloves I had were hiking gloves, which I don’t think would work well on the golf course,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Harvard students huddle outside a tent in the middle of a deserted Harvard Yard facing the statue of John Harvard at midnight last semester.
Squatting beneath a banner emblazoned with “The Leadership Campaign”—a student-led effort to “repower” the state with clean electricity by 2020—the three look on as a Harvard University Police Department officer pulls up behind them.
After a brief conversation, the three pack up the tent and head back to their dorms.
The three students—members of Students for a Just and Stable Future, a statewide network of students pushing for The Leadership Campaign’s clean energy goals—have been organizing “sleep outs” in the Yard throughout the semester to protest the University’s use of “dirty energy.”
Though the “sleep outs” have gained little traction on its founding campus—last semester’s nighttime events attracted an average of five students—the campaign has recruited roughly 500 students, an estimated 200 of whom will camp out on Boston Common tonight to support the passage of a bill calling for the creation of a clean energy task force.
While the campaign has established its presence on college campuses across the state, Harvard SJSF members say that Harvard College administration’s resistance to their “sleep outs” has hurt the group’s ability to build a larger support community on campus.
The College does not allow SJSF to sleep in the Yard every week, SJSF spokesman Jonathan M.L. Rosenthal ’13 says as he folds up a tent pole, and HUPD asks the students to leave every time they attempt to camp out.
“But we’ll be back tomorrow night, and so will they,” Rosenthal says.
ILLEGAL PROTESTING
The 10 students actively involved with SJSF at Harvard continue to face outreach challenges without the backing of the administration.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in an interview this February that she could not allow SJSF to hold sleep outs due to the “safety and security” risk Harvard’s urban campus poses for students.
When asked what academic repercussions student protestors would face if arrested at a “sleep out” off campus, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison did not eliminate the possibility of Ad Board hearings.
Though Ellison stressed that there is no blanket policy requiring arrested students to appear before the Ad Board, he said in a Feb. interview that the College does review off-campus arrests.
“We would not go after a student for protesting,” Ellison said. “But if it’s illegal protesting, that’s different.”
Given the chance that the Boston police may file charges or even arrest tonight’s protestors for trespassing on Boston Common, Rosenthal says participating Harvard students will most likely spend the night in Church on the Hill near the Common instead.
Unlike Harvard, other colleges such as Tufts and Brandeis have allowed and even encouraged on-campus sleep outs—the Tufts administration provided protestors with easy access to bathrooms for the night, campus coordinator Heather E. Bruckner says—and other coordinators say they were unaware of any academic consequences for protest-related arrests.
Rosenthal adds that Harvard SJSF lacks concrete support from the Environmental Action Committee, which has not actively pushed its members to participate in SJSF sleep outs.
At Brandeis, on the other hand, SJSF functions as a subcommittee of the larger environmental group on campus, which helped recruit over 100 students for this semester’s on-campus sleep out, Students for Environmental Action vice president Matt G. Gabrenya says.
“I do think it’s disappointing that Harvard has such ambitious reduction goals for itself but doesn’t encourage or support students who are trying to get similar levels passed elsewhere,” says SJSF founder Craig S. Altemose.
A ‘VARSITY SPORT’
Altemose, a joint student at Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School, says he wanted to capitalize on the “youthful idealism” of college students when he founded the group—then called the Mass. Power Shift Movement—in 2008.
This past fall, the group changed its name to SJSF and launched “The Leadership Campaign” to lobby for 100 percent clean electricity in Massachusetts by 2020, Altemose says.
Despite difficulties in recruiting members at Harvard, SJSF leaders say that as long as there is a core group of dedicated students at campuses across Massachusetts, the group will be strong enough to effect change in the state.
After a semester-long campaign, SJSF successfully introduced a bill in Dec. 2009 to create a clean energy task force with 17 legislators signing on as cosponsors and reached out to local businesses and churches across the state to support its efforts.
“I’ve been thinking this is more along the lines of a varsity sport. The people who commit to a varsity sport commit to practicing every day, getting up early, traveling every weekend,” Altemose says. “But at the end of the day, we’re not playing a game. We’re trying to save the world.”
When the SJSF protestors wake up tomorrow morning—either in their tents on Boston Common or in Church on the Hill, if they are asked to leave—they will march over to the Statehouse, waving signs and lobbying for the passage of their bill.
Though “internal politics” within the House Rules Committee will prevent SJSF from achieving its initial goal of passing the bill by Earth Day tomorrow, Altemose says that SJSF will create an independent task force of students, legislators, and community members to reach the 100 percent clean electricity goal if they are unable to pass the bill by the time the session ends in July.
This summer, SJSF plans to ride bicycles around the state to educate local communities about clean energy as part of the Massachusetts Climate Summer project.
Harvard campus coordinator Kani Keita ’12 adds that SJSF will redouble its efforts to recruit members, especially freshmen, at Harvard and other campuses.
“The main priority is making people aware of what the issue is, what our solution is, and how they can help us if they want to,” Keita says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tariq A. Musa ’10 left three Core classes for his senior spring semester, hoping they would “vanish” if he waited long enough.
Though his requirement tally did diminish by one when he joined the 43 other seniors who chose to make the last-minute leap from the Core to the Program in General Education, Musa says the benefits of switching proved to be more than just quantitative.
“Gen Ed classes seem more fresh,” he says. “The emphasis is more on taking the time to learn this stuff and getting comfortable with it rather than learning for an exam.”
While the Core focused on “ways of knowing” and required final exams in all courses, Gen Ed strives to connect class work to life outside Harvard’s “ivied walls” and to encourage non-traditional, interdisciplinary learning, according to its website.
Although Musa says he perceived a difference between his Core and Gen Ed classes, he says he knows very little about the specific ideology behind the shift in required curriculum.
Because the Gen Ed office’s efforts this year to realize its ideals have tended to occur behind the scenes, it remains unclear whether the undergraduate community has a solid grasp of the practical and philosophical differences between Core and Gen Ed.
HANDS-ON PEDAGOGY
Although the majority of the Gen Ed office’s time over the past year has been spent reworking course titles, merging offices with the Core program, and tackling other logistics of the transition, the office has also tried to nurture a less tangible goal—supporting non-traditional modes of learning.
In keeping with this mission, the office has become an advocate for artistic and creative coursework, according to Administrative Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen.
In February, the office provided space and funding for an open house showcasing Science of the Physical Universe 20, “What is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness” projects, ranging from videos about mitosis to models of the Big Bang.
The office also financed art supplies and sponsored an exhibit for Culture and Belief 12, “For the Love of God and His Prophet: Religion, Literature, and the Arts in Muslim Culture” this month, in which students presented model mosques and creative calligraphic depictions of Allah’s name.
“We use a lot of movies, video clips, and a lot of interaction in class,” says Nur N. Ibrahim ’13, a student in the course. “I feel that that’s the way a class should be, because it helps develop your skills in terms of media and communication and discussion.”
East Asian Studies Professor Shigehisa Kuriyama ’77 worked to incorporate more media assignments into his class, Culture and Belief 11, “Medicine and the Body in East Asia and in Europe,” after it became a Gen Ed course. Each week, students in the course create imovies or podcasts about the reading rather than writing response papers.
Science of the Physical Universe 12, “Natural Disasters” Preceptor Jeff Standish says the Gen Ed office was “instrumental” in supplying financial support as the course’s professor and preceptors designed hands-on labs from scratch, including simulations of volcanoes, landslides, and tornadoes.
“Another goal of how we look at this course—and it’s sort of a goal that Gen Ed has—is to give students the experience of being a scientist—of thinking like a scientist, collecting data like a scientist, and trying to come up with some conclusions,” Standish says.
Statistics Professor Xiao-Li Meng says that his Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 16, “Real Life Statistics: Your Chance at Happiness (Or Misery)” class, formerly Statistics 105, had always featured a series of speakers who connected the field to various real-world applications, like law or romance. But this year, the Gen Ed office sponsored all the speaker fees and publicized the talks widely, dramatically increasing the turnout for each event.
Associate Director of the Program in General Education Anne Marie E. Calareso says that the office has helped other courses plan trips to see American Repertory Theater performances, screen musicals, and invite performers—such as Salman Ahmad, a Pakistani rock musician—to classes.
“Word is starting to get out and faculty are coming to us with activities—things that they’ve always wanted to do or things they’ve done small scale in a department course,” Kenen says. “A lot of this never could have happened in the Core.”
MORE THAN A CHECKLIST
Next fall, the Gen Ed office wants to take its endeavors to the next level by sponsoring independent events, imbuing Gen Ed with a life beyond the course catalogue.
“We want Gen Ed to be a program and not just a list of requirements students check off as they finish,” Kenen says.
One of the office’s plans is to sponsor a “Versus” series in which two faculty members will discuss the same topic from different angles. The first installment—a debate between English Professor Louis Menand and Psychology Professor Steven Pinker regarding the place of religion in a liberal arts education—was originally planned for last week, but has been postponed until the fall due to scheduling issues.
Several Gen Ed Committee members’ passion for baseball inspired another tentative panel idea: eight faculty members—one from each Gen Ed category—will explain how they would teach a class about some aspect of baseball through the lenses of their respective fields.
Calareso says that a new student advisory group—the General Education Planning Committee—has met twice this semester to discuss what kinds of Gen Ed-sponsored events would be most interesting for students. Andrés Castro Samayoa ’10, a member of the committee, says he thinks the office “is very committed to listening to student perspectives and incorporating them as much as they can.”
But at this point, both Kenen and Calareso acknowledged that there is a major disconnect between the office’s efforts and student awareness of the Gen Ed mission.
“We’re working on how to communicate this new aspect of Gen Ed to students,” Kenen says. “It’s not just ‘how do we promote events?’ but ‘how do we shift how students think about this new part of the curriculum?’”
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS
This spring, a paper on stem cell research by Paul E. Schied ’13 was awarded the Conant Prize by the Gen Ed office for its interdisciplinary nature and emphasis on real-world applications.
While his paper had clearly mastered the ideals of Gen Ed, Schied himself says he is unsure of the exact differences between Gen Ed and Core.
Even the chair of the Undergraduate Council Education Committee, Kwang Y. “Joseph” Kim ’12 says he is not completely certain about how the overarching philosophy of Gen Ed differed from that of the Core.
Peter Chen ’13, who serves on both the Committee on General Education and the Gen Ed Planning Committee, says that he feels the extent of most students’ understanding of the Gen Ed program is simply that it gives broader category names to what were narrower Core categories.
“I think people understand that there is a difference between Gen Ed and Core, but it doesn’t go beyond that really,” says Chen.
One of the main tasks the Gen Ed Planning Committee has been charged with is developing programs that will resonate with undergraduates and help expand student understanding of Gen Ed’s goals, something Chen says he thinks may be a “hard transition.”
The bottom line, it seems, is that while the switch to Gen Ed may soon be technically complete, the accompanying ideological shift is still a work in progress.
“This is a program that’s in the makes—they’re always working on it, revising it, trying to make it better,” Kim says. “Whatever we have right now, it’s only going to get better.”

Bill Purcell will resign as the director of the Institute of Politics to work as an advisor on the University’s expansion into Allston, a project marked by uncertainty in a time of fiscal constraints.
Ending a two-year term as director of the IOP, Purcell is stepping down to serve as an advisor to University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who directs much of Harvard’s Allston development and its relations with the local community.
Purcell will now devote more time to his role as one of the co-chairs of the Allston Work Team, the group charged with examining the current state of and recommending strategies for Harvard’s expansion into Allston, where Purcell has worked on community betterment projects.
“It allows me to direct attention to where I’m most needed,” said Purcell, a former mayor of Nashville.
In recent months, University administrators have said that they are exploring a wide range of options regarding Harvard’s plans to develop its Allston property holdings.
“We continue to talk to developers, meet with other universities, and meet with other entities and see if we can import those lessons and figure out what, if anything, co-development and co-location might make sense,” Lapp said.
Purcell’s new role under Lapp will be largely similar to the position he holds on the Work Team, whose findings will be critical in determining the future direction of the University’s presence in Allston.
“This is a natural progression of the work that Bill has been doing helping to advise the University,” Lapp said.
As a young man growing up in Philadelphia, Purcell said he saw first hand the effects of a contentious university expansion on the community. In the 1950s, Purcell witnessed the University of Pennsylvania’s ill-fated development in its surrounding neighborhoods.
“It was one of those things that if you were a young man you knew that it seemed that the relationship was a difficult one,” Purcell said.
Recently, the Work Team has been examining how other universities have managed their own expansion projects into neighboring communities, hoping to learn from those developments as the University decides how it will move forward in Allston.
Meanwhile, Purcell leaves behind a positive legacy at the IOP, where former president Mary K.B. Cox ’10 said Purcell will be remembered as someone who expanded career counseling for students interested in public service careers.
This year, the IOP hired its first dedicated career counselor, a resource that has been a boon for students at the IOP, especially at a time when budgets across the University—including the IOP—are shrinking, Cox said.
“He has a real commitment to the students and improving their experience at the IOP and expanding and building the community that is there,” said Yonatan J. Kogan ’12, a student chair of the IOP fellows program.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates called on the nation's brightest young people to use their talents to engage with the world's biggest problems in an address to a packed Sanders Theatre this afternoon.
While he took care to not disparage those who enter high-paying careers directly after graduation, Gates said that the greatest impact will be made by those who devote their lives to fighting poverty, improving global health, and raising the standard of education.
"A lot of talent—a lot of the best minds—are going to sports or entertainment or investing or even to scientific innovation that is focused on the specific needs of the rich," Gates said. "When you work on a baldness drug, it’s a little bit different than working on a malaria drug."
The address was part of Gates' cross-country university tour, during which he spoke to students on five college campuses in California, Chicago, and Boston.
Gates, Harvard's most successful dropout, left the College in 1975, during his sophomore year.

It's the weekend, and midterms are upon us. FlyBy thinks it's time for another round of Around the Ivies.
Two Dartmouth seniors dressed in suits have celebrated the inauguration of the Ivy League's first Asian-American president with a gangster rap video. For approximately 95 percent of the video, you get to watch Tommy Shanahan and Matt Applegate grin at how attractive they think they are. From the lyrics: "We're dealing with something unheard of in this Ivy elitist institution. No I'm just fooling; he left Harvard behind, so what your rhyme, there is no crying, this is Hanover's time." At the end, the video says in green letters, "Congratulations, President Kim. Welcome home."
Students at Princeton are lobbying for the administration to open a chastity center. The president of Princeton's abstinence society says it's necessary to help rectify "the current double standard by which the University implicitly gives its seal of approval to a more libertarian view of sexuality.” With Princeton's endowment down 23 percent and University President Shirley Tilghman telling the Princetonian she does not think there is ample reason for a chastity center to be established, FlyBy thinks the whole enterprise seems a tad unlikely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even to this day, freshman Danielle Tetreault remembers the frustration she experienced trying to stop classmate Jennifer VanderMeulen when the two squared off against each other in high school lacrosse matches.
“When I played against her in high school, I knew she was a great player,” said Tetreault, who attended Guilderland High School, 150 miles from VanderMeulen’s Liverpool High School in upstate New York. “Everyone knew who she was. You got ticked off by how good she was and how many points she put up.”
By the time she graduated from high school, VanderMeulen had set her school’s scoring record with 213 career goals.
Luckily for Tetreault, she is now wearing the same color uniform as the 5’8” attacker, but VanderMeulen’s new opponents have faced just as much frustration.
Since VanderMeulen took her game to Harvard Stadium, the freshman has averaged 3.67 goals per game, good for first in the Ivy League and fourth in the country—making her the lone freshman among that nation’s top twenty scorers.
But while VanderMeulen has had success finding the back of the net all season, she has really come into her element this past week—notching six goals and two assists in the Crimson’s 15-9 victory over Holy Cross and three goals and two draw controls in Harvard’s 11-9 upset of Princeton.
While Saturday’s win over the Tigers was of great importance to the entire Crimson team—it kept Harvard’s playoff hopes alive and snapped a 17-year losing streak against Princeton—the victory had special significance for the freshman.
VanderMeulen, who as a senior in high school received interest from such top lacrosse programs as Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, and Duke, narrowed her final two choices down to the Crimson and the Tigers. She ultimately settled on coming to Cambridge because it would give her the opportunity to make a difference in determining the program’s future.
“The Princeton coach [Chris Sailer] always said, ‘We’re the established program,’” VanderMeulen said. “It felt great to show that we’re making a difference. Beating Princeton was just pretty sweet. Coming to Harvard was definitely the right decision.”
Not only did her team get the victory, the rookie played a crucial role in securing the win.
With the game knotted at two midway through the first period, VanderMeulen gave her team the lead for good with an unassisted score.
After being held scoreless over the first 13 minutes of play, VanderMeulen received the ball several yards away from the goal. She juked past her defender, getting right to the goal before letting a shot go at point-blank range that found its target.
With 5:30 left, VanderMeulen gave her team its largest lead of the first half, driving past two defenders and finishing an unassisted score that put the Crimson ahead 6-2.
“[VanderMeulen’s] always ready to play hard. She knows what it is to play in big games,” Tetreault said. “She’s a player that other teams are watching. Because of that, they put their best defender on her, but Jenn always finds a way around that.”
Harvard’s lead grew to five early in the second when VanderMeulen fired a free position shot past the Tigers goalkeeper for her Ivy League-leading 44th score of the season.
But it was more than her scoring that helped propel the Crimson to victory. Down the stretch, VanderMeulen picked up key draw controls that allowed Harvard to maintain possession long enough to drain the clock and make a Princeton comeback impossible, as the Crimson finished the contest ahead, 11-9.
“The [Tigers] coach just shook my hand and said, ‘Great game, Jenn,’” VanderMeulen said. “I think she was happy for me. She always respected my decision to go here.”
VanderMeulen had an even more impressive individual performance in her team’s Wednesday afternoon win at home against the Crusaders. In the match, VanderMeulen tallied a career-high six goals and eight points.
With 44 tallies and three games remaining, VanderMeulen is in prime position to surpass the 46 scores posted last season by Jess Halpern during her sophomore year.
While VanderMeulen was expected to make an impact from day one, expectations grew when Halpern sustained a season-ending injury in her team’s second game, making the freshman the team’s number one scoring option.
Thankfully for the entire Harvard team, VanderMeulen picked up in college right from where she left off in high school.
“[Coach Lisa Miller] expected a lot from me going in,” VanderMeulen said. “I’m pretty lucky that the transition has been easy for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nine innings of play, one had to wonder if the Harvard softball team’s game against the University of Rhode Island (15-24, 5-5 Atlantic 10) would ever end. When sophomore first baseman Whitney Shaw hit her second home run of the day out of the URI Softball Complex in the top of the tenth, it looked like the Crimson might steal the win. But in the bottom of the inning, Rams freshman Erika Szymanski took matters into her own hands, blasting a three-run homer that sent the ball sailing over the center-field fence and Harvard (18-20, 9-3 Ivy) back to the bus with a 7-5 loss.
“It was a tough loss,” co-captain Margaux Black said. “URI really battled. It went back and forth, but they ended up on top.”
The final outcome would not have been obvious in the first few innings, as the Crimson held the Rams scoreless through the first five frames.
“Our defense was really solid,” Shaw said. “We really helped our pitchers, helped out our offense with our defense.”
In the first inning, the Harvard offense got going when senior catcher Jessica Pledger walked with the bases loaded to score classmate and outfielder Stephanie Krysiak, a Crimson sports editor.
Two innings later, Harvard struck again—this time much more emphatically, as Shaw sent her first home run of the day to center field.
“I was just trying to help my team,” Shaw said. “I was trying to do what everyone was trying to do: get hits, get runs, keep the pressure on them.”
On the defensive side, sophomore Julia Moore held URI to zero runs and three hits in two innings of pitching before she was replaced by classmate Mari Zumbro.
“Because this isn’t our Ivy League game, we really just wanted to get everyone a chance on the mound,” Pledger said. “Jules had a great start, but we wanted to get everyone a turn.”
When Zumbro took over for Moore on the mound, she didn’t miss a beat, allowing zero runs and only three hits in her first three innings.
“Mari hasn’t seen a lot of time,” Pledger said. “She did a great job. She was picking her pitches well, got a lot of outs. She did a great job getting ahead on batters.”
But in the sixth inning, URI was all over Zumbro, scoring three runs on four hits to turn a two-run deficit into a 3-2 lead.
“We were sitting on our lead and coasting,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “They started to hit our pitcher.”
The first to strike for the Rams was sophomore outfielder Brittany Julich, who sent home teammates Amanda Sbei and Kelly Coker on a single. Next up, sophomore catcher Nicole Massoni doubled to send Julich home.
“[URI] showed a lot of fight,” Pledger said.
The game might have ended in seven innings had it not been for an unearned run scored in the top of the frame after a pair errors by Rams shortstop Courtney Prendergastt. Junior outfielder Emily Henderson grounded a ball to Prendergastt, whose throwing error allowed the outfielder to reach second. After advancing to third on a Krysiak groundout, Henderson scored to send the game into extra innings as Prendergastt misplayed a ball batted by co-captain Melissa Schellberg, a Crimson sports editor.
“We never let up,” Shaw said. “We were resilient.”
But the squad was unable to score for the next two innings.
“We definitely need to be stronger and more aggressive at the plate and swing for hits instead of swinging not to get out,” Allard said.
Luckily for Harvard, it was able to prevent URI from plating any runs in those innings. All looked lost for a moment when the bases were loaded and Julich was heading for home plate on a groundball, but sophomore shortstop Jane Alexander made the play, getting the ball to Pledger in time for the out.
“It was a huge stop,” Black said.
And for another inning, the two teams fought on in a stalemate.
“We would get runners on base and not score. They would get runners on base and we would hold them,” Pledger said. “It was just a battle until the end.”
It looked like the Crimson would pull out the win when Shaw hit a two-run shot, her second home run on the game, in the top of the tenth. But Rams right fielder Melissa Wilson responded in the bottom of the inning with an RBI of her own to pull the Rams within one, before Szymanski blasted a walk-off three-run homer against Crimson freshman Jessica Ferri to win the game, 7-5.
“Honestly, it just makes us hungry for the weekend,” Black said. “We’ll come out ready to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard campus welcomes an influx of newly admitted students for Pre-Frosh weekend, many high school seniors will probably be wondering how to balance their interests and manage their time in college. These students should take a lesson from freshman middle blocker Paul Glootz.
Glootz is a man of many talents. The native of Stassfurt, Germany is dedicated to his studies, committed to playing the piano, and boasts national titles in both the accordion and in the building of water rockets. In addition to all of this, Glootz walked on to the men’s volleyball team this fall and worked his way to a starting spot, despite injuries to both ankles early in the season.
“Paul came in as a freshman walk-on, and we really didn’t know what to expect from him in terms of his skill and dedication,” co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “We’ve been nothing but impressed in terms of his qualities as a person and a volleyball player and his determination to get better.”
Glootz dominated the middle of the court this season, playing in 13 of the Crimson’s 21 matches after recovering from his injury.
“[During] J-term practice, we had a scrimmage and I [badly sprained] both ankles,” Glootz said. “I did a lot of physical therapy and was out for about seven weeks. So for me, the season really started in the last third.”
Averaging 0.53 kills per set, Glootz recorded a total of 25 kills and 27 digs on the year. He ranked fourth on the team in blocks, with 40 total and an average of 0.85 blocks per set.
Clearly, Glootz’s teammates appreciated his impact. But, just one year ago, the rookie would not have even seen himself on the volleyball court at Harvard. In fact, he only picked up the sport in high school.
“I didn’t expect to be able to play any college-level sports, but I started playing volleyball in 2007,” Glootz noted. “Back home in Germany, I was on a club team...and I thought it was a lot of fun. I tried out crew for the first three weeks [this fall] but then switched from crew to volleyball.”
Though his knack for blocking and killing the volleyball are recent discoveries, Glootz developed a love for music at a young age. He admits that the piano is his primary instrument, but he took his love of the accordion to a high level, winning a U-17 national title in the instrument at a ripe age of 14.
“Right now I just take it out for fun,” Glootz commented. “Soren Rosier, who’s a senior on the team, made me play ‘The Final Countdown’ in the Kirkland dining hall on the accordion.”
“It’s not a common instrument, especially in America,” he continued. “So I sometimes just like to take it out, have a good time, and make some people happy.”
In high school, Glootz also cultivated an interest in water rockets, adding another national title to his repertoire in a water rocket building competition with one of his close friends. Though he is plenty busy at Harvard, Glootz claims the balance between all of his activities has been easier to maintain than he anticipated.
“I went to a magnet school back home in Germany for math, science, and technology,” he said. “My schedule there involved at least 42 hours of classes a week and school was one hour and a half away so I had to get up at 4:30 in the morning...and I wouldn’t get back home until around 10 at night. So I find myself having a lot more time and more sleep [in college].”
With this extra time, Glootz is able to dedicate himself to the game of volleyball.
“He’s just a well-rounded, great person,” Weintraub said. “He’s also a master of the accordion...He’s super talented, a great teammate, and a very funny guy.”
The volleyball team, like several other Crimson teams, is no stranger to walk-ons, with around one per year joining the Havard ranks. But, athletes who make the team in this manner face extra challenges.
“The burden is on walk-ons to try to keep up,” Weintraub said. “Paul has not only kept up, but he is pushing the speed of improvement. He definitely has a bright future ahead of him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend at its awards banquet at the Harvard Club of Boston, the Harvard men's hockey team named juniors Michael Del Mauro and Chris Huxley as its 117th and 118th captains. Classmate Kyle Richter was designated as assistant captain.
In the 111-year history of Crimson hockey, only four pairs of co-captains had been named prior to Del Mauro and Huxley.
Huxley, a defenseman from Weymouth, Mass., has been a consistent presence in the Harvard defense since his freshman year. As a rookie, Huxley helped the Crimson to the top spot in the ECAC in scoring defense and penalty killing. In the 2008-2009 season, Huxley was just one of five players on the Harvard roster to skate in all 31 games and formed part of the ECAC's top power play unit.
Hailing from Watchung, N.J., Del Mauro has been a two-year ECAC All-Academic selection. The forward notched three assists this season—against Colgate, Yale and Dartmouth.
Before taking last year off due to unspecified reasons, Richter was named the ECAC Goalie of the Year in his sophomore season after pacing the league with a 1.82-goals against average and a .935 save percentage. After sharing duty between the pipes earlier this season with classmate Ryan Carroll, Richter took over the starting position soon after Harvard's loss to Northeastern in the Beanpot.
The trio will look to turn the Crimson around after a season in which the team held a 9-21-3 overall record that included a 10 game no-win streak in November and December.

Dartmouth has hired Golden State Warriors scout Paul Cormier as its men's basketball coach.
Cormier had previously coached at Dartmouth from 1984-1991, accumulating a record of 87-95 with the Big Green. He more recently served as Fairfield's head coach for seven seasons before moving on to posts with several NBA teams.
Cormier fills a vacancy left by former Dartmouth coach Terry Dunn, who resigned before the team's Ivy opener against Harvard on Jan. 9. Assistant coach Mark Graupe stepped in and went 2-12 as interim coach for the rest of the season.
Albany men’s basketball coach Will Brown, one of the three finalists for the position, withdrew his name from the Dartmouth coaching search earlier today. Saint Anselm coach Keith Dickson was the other candidate.
A press conference will be held to introduce Cormier Monday afternoon.

It’s that time of year again. Birds are chirping, legs are showing, and fear is spreading across the campus as people  flee from armed assailants.
Assassins games have sprung up almost everywhere and epic stories of intrigue, espionage, and broken friendships  abound. Kills are executed in the darkness and in the open.
At one fateful lunch in Leverett dining hall, a very public hit showed just how intense one Assassins game had  gotten. This Flyby correspondent (a Leverett House resident) was enjoying a meal when a loud shout was uttered.
The hall went quiet as frightened students frantically tried to locate the source of the disturbance,  perhaps wondering if their own assassination was impending. But no, an assassin  had already marked his prey.
Cookies were cast awry as the assassin gave chase. His quarry faked left and right, but could find no escape.  Spotting a cookie and brownie-laden isle, the prey doubled back and around the  fixture, searching frantically for a point of egress. The predator raced along an array of juices and milks, his menacing gait punctuated by the spoon he  held clutched in his right hand. Ten feet, six feet, three feet lay between  the pursued and a gruesome death by spoon.
The assassin lunged…
But lo! The mark was not unarmed. In one deft movement, he leapt back and fired off a single burst from his  Super Soaker as silver death arced through the air. And then, silence. The  would-be assassin had failed.
Soon after onlookers returned to their meals and polite conversation, quickly relegating the confrontation to  the back of their minds, recognizing it as a necessary feature of a campus at war.
Kirkland, Quincy, Winthrop, Adams, Pforzheimer, Currier, Lowell, Eliot, Canaday, Cabot, Dunster, Currier,  the Black Students Association, and the Latino community have either  started, finished, or about to begin some variant of Assassins, so chances are if  you’re reading this, you have an assassination story to tell. Think it’s worth  sharing? Submit your story to “M” for a chance at fame and the title “FlyBy Bond: Harvard’s Top Assassin.”

Over one hundred hungry students and some well-aged individuals showed up to devour several different samples of local artisanal cheese at the Cheese Tasting Expo in Ticknor Lounge today.
This event, co-sponsored by the Food Literacy Project and the non-profit Keep Local Farms, attracted a large group of both cheese-lovers and free-food lovers. It was meant to bring awareness to the local farms, while enabling students to learn about the New England dairy industry and cheese making process.
The cheeses, such as gouda and cheddar, were made in various locations in New England from Smith’s Country Cheese of Massachusetts to Pineland Farms of Maine.
Those who were lucky enough to stick around for longer got a chance to learn about the cheese making process from David J. Smith, owner of Smith’s Country Cheese. Smith, also known as Age Gouda, had students answer trivia questions for free T-shirts and free bracelets were passed around.
Alyssa P. Murray ’12, a self-proclaimed cheese-lover, said, “I thought it was really entertaining and unique event. We usually bring in established speakers and it was refreshing to have a dairy farmer with big belt buckle to come and speak.”
When asked what she thought of the cheese, Murray responded, “They were good. I liked the aged gouda. Harvard should use [these] cheese for cheese night, in support of local farms.”
Sadly, the Age Gouda informed the crowd that he doesn’t give tours of his factory; there is however a DVD available at his farm that showcases the entire cheese-making process.
