Three years into its brand-new Theatre, Dance, and Media concentration, Harvard is celebrating another first: the first-ever senior thesis to take the form of a choreographed dance performance. Created and directed by Tiffany Y. Lau ’19, the show, “figures;” opens at the Harvard Dance Center on Dec. 7 at 7 p.m. and will run for the whole weekend. A showcase of all-original choreography inspired by both Lau’s experiences and those of her dancers, “figures;” sets out to explore the physicality of holding on, letting go, and connecting to others. With an all-student cast and production team, as well as a moving set complete with synthetic ice, “figures;” hopes to push the boundaries of student leadership and performance in dance at Harvard.
For Lau, the show’s theme of “groundedness” is a fitting synthesis of her many academic and artistic explorations over her four years at Harvard. Its inspiration includes everything from her research on the increasingly disembodied identity of her native Hong Kong to her personal experience leaving behind a nationally recognized figure skating career.
Those influences can explain some of the more experimental decisions Lau makes, particularly her choice to include moments of literal figure skating on special platform in the choreography. Conceptually, Lau incorporates the emotions associated with those experiences into the movement through the idea of “in-between structures,” the physical or personal things that tether us to the ground in moments of flux and change. “I want to see how through performance and performing identity, I can explore in the cultural and interpersonal sense the way people can find those connections that can enable them to navigate groundlessness and having identity taken away,” Lau says.
Because this is the first performance and thesis of its kind, faculty advisors in the TDM concentration are looking forward to it debut, which will also make particular use of its setting.
“There’s an intimacy about the setting, and about the way that she’s thinking about dance as a non-verbal medium through which to talk about identity and belonging and the difference between those terrains in life,” says Harvard’s Dance director Jill Johnson, who serves as Tiffany’s faculty advisor. “It’s an invitation for an audience to come and experience that,”
The project is not only a personal one; the collective need to “hold on” transcends individual experience. For its audience members, “figures;” hopes to respond to that need by physicalizing an immersive, interactive portrait of groundedness, and be, as Lau puts it, “an invitation to connectedness.”
Correction: Dec. 4, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the dance performance "figures;" will feature giant synthetic eyes. In fact, it will feature synthetic ice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s influence has extended well beyond the Supreme Court and into pop culture in the last few years, captured in “Notorious RBG” memes, comedic videos of her exercise routine, and PBS documentaries following her life story. Underlying all this is Ginsburg’s reputation as a feminist icon, a view that director Mimi Leder’s “On the Basis of Sex” continues to explore by shining a light on Ginsburg’s lesser known early career as a law student, professor, young attorney, and mother.
In the film, Ginsburg (Felicity Jones) begins her first day at Harvard Law School as she faces discrimination at every level and eventually takes on the first landmark cases defining gender discrimination. Reminders of inequity in and out of the courts are glaring: From being made the butt of a joke in a class of male peers to being told she is not fit for a position at a law firm to spare the feelings of other attorneys’ wives, Ginsburg faces gender discrimination in a number of ways. Even the number of scenes in which Jones is the only woman in the shot is telling.
The discussion of discrimination is at the heart of the film and impossible to miss or ignore, showing both how far society has come since the 1960s and how many gender norms remain. In fact, Ginsburg’s legal argument in the film depends on the notion that society has changed (in the 1970s). Thus, the legal precedent of upholding laws that treat men and women differently no longer applies, pointing to young people as signs of progress and hope for the future. This message is clearly aware of its modern cultural and political context. The constant visual and thematic reminders of inequality feel heavy-handed, but this does communicate how pervasive and unavoidable discrimination is for the women who experience it, particularly as male characters repeatedly deny its existence.
While the intent to illuminate discrimination and showcase the woman who fights against it is clear, the film has its ups and downs in execution. Much of the film is centered around Ginsburg’s case, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, significant for the precedent it set by defending a man who suffered from legal discrimination in a niche tax code. Yet, it is actually Marty Ginsburg (Armie Hammer), Ruth’s husband, who finds the case and essentially delivers it to her to appease her dissatisfaction with limited opportunity in a set up that seems to diminish Ruth’s agency. The film also falls into cliché territory with its antagonists: A group of old, powerful white men representing the government in the lawsuit serve as prototypical symbols of the “the institution.” Meanwhile, Mel Wulf (Justin Theroux), the director of the ACLU, is a supposed civil rights champion who nonetheless rejects the notion that women’s rights or gender discrimination exists — a frustrating yet compelling figure who embodies complex historical perspectives on equality. His instructions for Ruth to smile more, stay in the background, and seem less “bitter” are infuriating, but only because they ring true to dialogue that persists today. Theroux’s character rides the line between antagonist and supporter, further illuminating the subtlety and universality of sexism.
Additionally, family grounds the film — a compelling surprise given the expectation of a historical legal drama. Jones and Hammer deliver nuanced performances as a loving couple that form a team both at home and in the courtroom. Ruth and Marty’s family with their daughter Jane (Cailee Spaeny) ensures that the film maintains a sense of humanity and relatability that can often be lost in jargon and courtroom intrigue. The fascinating exploration of balance and equality in their marriage and generational feminist tensions in Ruth’s relationship with Jane are accessible while contributing to the film’s broader conversation. That being said, legal battles drive much of the film’s conflict, with an effective soundtrack, tight close-ups, and passionate argumentation generating tension and excitement. These features are well executed, although the constant close-ups can be a bit disconcerting, and audiences looking for a little more action and theatrics may be disappointed.
“On the Basis of Sex” is not necessarily groundbreaking, but its generally solid delivery and wonderful performances create a compelling ride. Fans of the courtroom drama or Ginsburg herself ought to give it a shot “on the basis” of the relatively unheard story it tells about the beginning of the Justice’s journey and of the battle for gender equality in the law.

If you’ve ever used a dating app, then perhaps you, like so many others, have been overcome with the urge to bedeck your Tinder profile with quotes from wiser and funnier sources. But with such bold quotational aspirations, you face a problem. How will you find the right quote? How will you make sure that everyone knows you’re 100 percent, definitely quoting someone? How can you best convey the essence of your soul via 12 words from a movie you watched five years ago?
Here’s what Crimson Arts, the inarguable authority on artistic quality, suggests.
“‘You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. — Wayne Gretzky’ — Michael Scott” (“The Office,” 2009)
You are the first person to ever think of quoting this line. Your allusion to a niche show like “The Office” is unprecedented. Humor reached its apex in the Year of Our Lord 2009.
Congratulations. It’s all downhill from here.
“The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” (“Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,” 1982 and subsequent films)
Flex your intellectual prowess by quoting multiple Star Trek movies at once (!) and also, like, probably Plato or somebody. Anyone interesting will be thrilled to share their take on how Spock speaks to centuries of philosophical precedent (although notably, this tactic may be most effective on men). Be sure to let your potential hookup know right off the bat that you’re here to save our collective humanity, and that their individual form is — from a utilitarian perspective — irrelevant.
“Son of a bench,” “ash-hole,” and “bullshirt.” (“The Good Place,” 2016 - )
You may be on Tinder, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be family friendly. Let potential dates know that you’re a badash motherforker who bingewatched all three seasons of “The Good Place,” alone, from within a blanket cocoon.
“Just keep swimming.” (“Finding Nemo,” 2003)
Add this to your bio to give dating-app-users in the ether a boost of reassurance. They’re smiling in their profile pictures — but how are they really doing? Have they called their mom recently? Are they drinking enough water?
You’re probably not looking for hookups.
“I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could.” (“Get Out,” 2017) 
Inject even more politics into your dating life! Yeah, midterms are over, but it’s not too late to aggressively push people to vote (for either party, of course) in your bio. You are a changemaker, a visionary, an innovator — and without you, who knows what this country might come to? At the very least, you’ll ensure that any Tinder prospects share your impeccable political taste.
“I'm already pregnant. So, what other kind of shenanigans could I get myself into?” (“Juno,” 2007)
Bonus points if the whole “pregnant” thing is true for you, but it doesn’t have to be. You already get credit for using the word “shenanigans” on a dating app. If you can’t beat ’em or join ’em, just confuse ’em.
—Iris M. Lewis, incoming Campus Exec, let her friends make her a Tinder once. She has no forking clue how it works.

I love window shopping. December gives me an excuse to splurge on this otherwise useless activity under the pretense that I’m looking for gifts for the important people in my life. For those of you who would rather indulge in other activities, or, more practically, sleep/cram for finals in Lamont: You’ll probably find some use in a gift guide that allows you to spend less time wandering aimlessly around either multi-story warehouses full of unnecessary gadgets, or crammed rooms filled with cutesy, bank-breaking, “vintage” items. Note: This gift guide is not organized into “for her” and “for him” sections — because it’s 2018 and gender is fluid, kids.
The Roomies
Laundry detergent or pods: This is not only useful and considerate, it also means your roommates will no longer need to “borrow” your detergent all the time. Same concept applies for toothpaste, shower gel, you get the point.
Candles: Are they really for your roommates, or are they for you? Get them in your favorite scent and don’t worry about answering the question. If you don’t want to get in trouble with Harvard’s residential administrators, buy some fake electric candles — it’s the thought that counts.
Deodorant. *hint hint hint*
The Empty Nesters (aka The Parents)
Report Card: With all the $$$ poured into tuition, not to mention all the blood and work your parents put into raising you, the least you can do is return some decent grades for the holidays. The Harvard diploma will be the ultimate gift, but, until then, bank on Harvard’s rampant grade inflation to make your parents happy.
A Job: And by that, I don’t mean get them a job. Get yourself a job.
The Bird Nesters (What are bird nesters? People with bad hair)
Quality Conditioner: Back in my years of teenage angst, I once gifted an adult I deeply disliked a bottle of “Intense Moisturizing Treatment” conditioner, a not-so-subtle attack on the quality of this person’s hair… yeah, not my proudest moment.
The Ex
Lost Items: The nicest thing you can do for your ex-love is to return their hoodies, shirts, and lost items — burning them or throwing them in the Charles River. Not like I’ve done either of those things.
The Ghosted
A text: Do you remember that “really nice” person you went on one date with, and “really liked,” but you know, you “really just weren’t sure you were actually looking for anything serious,” so you never texted them back? Shoot them a “happy holidays” message. It’s cuffing season, folks.
So there you have it. By the decrease in quality as you go down the list, you can probably tell that I’ve lost interest in this gift guide. Let me peacefully retreat back in my corner of breaking news, investigative stories, and comper-feared features, please.
—Lucy Wang is the outgoing Campus Exec and incoming Editor-At-Large. If you have, will, or ever even considered comping Arts, please do not ask her about features. She will be triggered. Oh, and follow her on Twitter @lucyyloo22.

Romantic prospects on campus are slim and, as my Taiwanese grandma is wont to remind me, my biological clock is ticking. I’ve decided to refocus my attentions toward a much more attainable romantic pursuit: Celebrities. Below, a comprehensive guide to my celebrity crushes as production night moods. After all, what’s love without Arts? (Answer: Non-existent.)
#5: John Krasinski
At peak witty repartée, this production night echoes Jim Halpert’s trademark everyman, sardonic charm. There are lots of zany antics and very little measurable productivity. The President’s chair is found lodged in one massive block of chartreuse Jell-O. One exec glances at an imaginary camera in incredulity and amusement. By 11 p.m., most execs have peaced the hell out with half-hearted promises to “address edits from home” and the vibe is decidedly less Dunder Mifflin and more “A Quiet Place.” As the third High School Musical soundtrack blares from someone’s tinny computer speakers, other Crimeds in the newsroom are shooting us death glares. Lest we get mauled by supernatural alien monsters, keep it below 0.2 decibels!
#4: Henry Golding
We’re all in love with Constance Wu. Michelle Yeoh is our collective mom. Grace lets me drop $8 on a Felipe’s burrito, which makes us feel crazy, rich, and Asian, until Bank of America emails me to remind me that my checking account balance is -$8. How spontaneous and exciting!
#3: Timothée Chalamet
A picture leaks of one of us hanging out in the L*mpoon, eliciting extreme feelings of betrayal. Mila reminds us that she (a) is from Westchester but went to school in the city (“New York is the best city in the world”) and (b) also speaks fluent French. It’s endearing but, like, a little gratuitous. Then her French AutoCorrect changes “the” to “thé” and “champion” to “champignons.” We roast her in the group chat. It’s very embarrassing, much like my infatuation with Timothée Chalamet. Please don’t tell anybody.
#2: Harry Styles
Arts execs make questionable sartorial decisions, including, but not limited to, glittery Gucci suits. Production night oscillates wildly from low culture to high culture as the collaborative playlist jumps from Fleetwood Mac, to Carly Rae Jepsen, to Beethoven, to Hannah Montana (incidentally, all musical influences of Harry Styles*). Execs keep adding songs with wild abandon, and the playlist extends, much like One Direction’s hiatus, indefinitely. *Not confirmed by Harry Styles.
#1: Claire Foy
Classy and refined, this production night starts out with English breakfast tea from Quincy dining hall. Ethan is alternately speaking in the Queen’s English and a thick Scottish brogue. Like Queen Elizabeth II, we at the Crimson are also fond of turkey shooting. (Both kinds of shoot are archaic relics of an older, genteel (read: elitist) tradition and unnecessarily take a lot of time.) Production night quickly spirals into a “Girl in the Spider’s Web” hostage situation, with Arts pages lost in cyberspace. Who the hell was on InDesign duty tonight? Oh my god. We’re gonna be here forever, aren’t we?
—Caroline A. Tsai is the outgoing Film Exec and incoming Arts Chair. She thinks rom-com tropes are totally banal, but a) frequently runs into people and spills her books everywhere, b) always seems to be dramatically rushing to the airport last-minute, and c) now works in “the media,” I guess. This should make her a prime rom-com protagonist. Irritatingly, she’s more of a quirky best friend. Direct enquiries (business, romantic, or otherwise) to her manager at kaylee.kim@thecrimson.com. D-listers need not apply.

If you’ve ever taken a humanities course, there’s almost always one kid in your section that not only believes his taste is better than yours, but wants you to know it, too. One way to know if you have your very own Pretentious Section Kid in your class is to see if they mention any of the works of literature listed below.
William Faulkner’s “The Sound and the Fury”
Pretentious Section Kid loves all Faulkner, but especially “The Sound and the Fury.” You should be suspicious of anyone who loves Faulkner, yet can’t think of any reason to praise him besides his pretentious writing style. We’re seriously talking about a man who wrote a novel — “As I Lay Dying” — in six weeks and didn’t edit a single word, and it was no more sloppily written than the rest of his works.
Plato’s “Republic”
While discussing a small section of Plato’s “Republic,” Pretentious Section Kid will boldly proclaim that he has read the entirety of the work. He will then proceed to explain the context of the excerpt to the rest of the class until the TF gathers the courage to cut him off and redirect the conversation.
David Foster Wallace’s “Infinite Jest”
Not only does Pretentious Section Kid love David Foster Wallace’s unnecessarily wordy novel, he will also recommend DFW’s essays to the rest of the uncultured class. You’ll know if you have a particularly bad Pretentious Section Kid if he ever dons the notorious red bandana.
Virgil’s “Aeneid” in the original Latin
It’s not enough that he’s read the “Aeneid,” Pretentious Section Kid will loudly proclaim that it is “much more beautiful in its original language” and that everyone else is “missing out on a wonderful literary experience.” The TF will politely agree while everyone else in your section rolls their eyes.
James Joyce’s “Ulysses”
With only a hint of a segue, Pretentious Section Kid will somehow manage to mention his favorite novel of all: “Ulysses.” As you can tell, Pretentious Section Kid is a big fan of stream-of-consciousness, yet seems completely uninterested in (better) authors of this style like Toni Morrison or Virginia Woolf.
—Outgoing AND incoming Books Executive Caroline E. Tew can be found reading all the books by brilliant female authors that Pretentious Section Kids refuse to read.

As the incoming Film Exec, I hope to gently nudge my fellow overworked Arts writers towards a healthier lifestyle. I promise that if you pick up my pitches, you’ll enjoy more freedom than you would writing for any other section. No more staying up late to meet deadlines. Harvard is difficult enough as it is; as we lose touch with the joy of exploratory learning, trudging through assignments that feel forced upon us. In hopes of making your work at The Crimson more efficient, I’ve provided a set of guidelines with original buzzwords and a consistent set of star ratings you can use to write quick, painless reviews without having to ever watch a single film.
Online Screeners: Sleep debt is a real problem in college. If you pick up an online screener, I require that you sleep while it plays. As your self-appointed wellness mentor, I require that you be tucked into bed and in a horizontal position; no laying prostrate — it’s bad for your back. For maximum comfort, you must also wear a pajama uniform from the Life is Good company (I get a commission). You can assess the quality of the film by the quality of your sleep. If your sleep is un-interrupted, the “boring” film will earn -1/10 stars. If you awake intermittently, you will assign the “decent” film 3/6 stars.
Lunch Break: The outgoing Film Exec forbade me from taking bathroom breaks when watching films in theaters because I should be a serious, meticulous Harvard critic. In the case of emergencies, I was told that I could tell exactly when to take strategic breaks by paying attention to context clues and the narrative development in a film. I wasn’t to miss any important details. But this semester, self-care is the order of the day. Next to AMC Boston Common, where most screenings take place, The Thinking Cup sells excellent paninis. I want you to be well-nourished, so I require you to take your mid-film lunch break there. Attendance will be taken (I get a commission). When you come back at the very end of the film, you won’t know what’s going on, or how the characters got from point A to point B. A film that is so “lacking in context clues and narrative development” should earn 0/15 stars.
Personal Happiness: I want you to be happy. Laughter is the best medicine, so when the audience laughs, you must laugh. A “funny” film would earn 6/5 stars. Aristotle championed the social value of tragedy because it induces catharsis in spectators. In other words, crying is also good for you, so I require you to cry when the audience cries. A “sad” film would earn 13/16 stars. If the audience cries hysterically, the “poignant” film gets 15/17 stars. I also require that you use Kirkland Signature tissues to dry your tears (I’m an influencer for Costco, so I get a commission), and that you submit physical proof of your emotionally cleansed state along with your review.
Disclaimer: The author does not actually receive commision from Life is Good, The Thinking Cup, or Costco. Unfortunately.
—Incoming Film Exec and wellness revolutionary Claire N. Park intends to forge a reputation as the most laid-back exec the Arts board has ever seen. She is fed up with Harvard’s culture of overwork and selling out. She believes that the historic reluctance of Arts writers past in picking up film pitches was due to their previously demanding requirements, so every writer will now be contractually obligated to pick up two of her pitches every week. It’s for their own good.

The high five is as ubiquitous as air. Doctors welcome infants into the world with high fives. Couples high five at the altar. College students high five at social gatherings to prove their worth. It’s a versatile gesture, appropriate at both funerals of enemies and funerals of friends. It’s integral to the way we live and the way we interact, yet too often do we overlook its storied past. As a corrective gesture, here are the top five high fives of all time.
5. The Liberatores
This pioneering high five took place on the Ides of March in 44 BC. After leaving Caesar’s corpse on the steps of the Theater of Pompey’s curia, the 60 senators who conspired to assassinate him marched to the Capitol while proclaiming, “People of Rome, we are once again free!” Undeterred by the silence that greeted them, the Liberatores initiated a stunningly synchronized group high five, followed by an equally coordinated low five. Brutus then did a backflip, securing this moment’s place in the annals of high five history.
4. Anya Gablogian and Abraham Marinovic
These world-renowned performance artists met in the mid-70s and instantly embarked on a collaboration that produced joint works like “Hirsutism in Time,” in which the two tied their leg hairs together and lay still for a day, and “Double Triple A,” in which they screamed into each other’s nostrils until one passed out. By the end of the ’80s, Gablogian and Marinovic’s relationship had become fraught, and they decided to part ways with a final piece, “Fivers.” They each began walking from a different end of the Great Wall of China and met each other in the middle. There, they exchanged a somber high five and a “down low, too slow” — a fitting close to an intense, beautiful partnership.
3. Fritz Frank and Aloysius Jaguartrap
In 2014, these two daredevils from Stamford, Conn. decided to break the record for Longest Continuous High Five. Over the course of 72 hours, Frank and Jaguartrap high fived repeatedly and without break, adding in such flourishes as whirligigs, alligator bobs, lightning-fast dock/undocks, finger guns, finger knives, pinky pops and locks, and more. In order to stay awake and stave off hunger, the two jogged on facing treadmills, covered themselves with caffeine patches, and hooked themselves up to IV drips. Although they broke the record by the hour mark, Frank and Jaguartrap died of exhaustion three days in.
2. God and Mary
This high five between a Nazarene woman and the creator of the universe occurred directly after the conception of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, nine months before the year 0. While the high five itself was unremarkable — Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, failed to watch the elbow, weakly thwapping his pinkies against Mary’s — it claims a spot on this list for the event it marked, the celebrity of the individuals involved, and the whip pan to Joseph, who looked into the camera, delivered a confident thumbs up, and said, “Nice.”
1. Patrick Chakakhan and Spencer Easybib
At 1 a.m. on June 15, 2005, these teenage friends managed to park their car with unusual precision outside of a Jack in the Box in Fresno, Calif. (cf. “Top Five Parking Jobs”), a feat made all the more impressive by the concentration of marijuana in their body. To celebrate, they performed a high five of such perfection that it produced a shockwave, shattering all windows and streetlamps within a half-kilometer radius and knocking the two to the ground with several broken bones. The high five was so powerful that Chakakhan and Easybib fell frantically in love with each other, yet neither have acted on their feelings out of insecurity and internalized homophobia. The two have spent the subsequent decade sitting in pregnant silences and trading pained glances of longing.

For a semi-professional cinephile, these are truly delightful times. Not only is there a genuine glut of films released every year (246 this year, by Wikipedia’s count), but there are countless streaming services via which you can view nearly every somewhat important film ever released. Beyond that, television is becoming bigger, bolder, and broader! Verily, ’tis a golden age in which we live.
So why don’t we just chill out for a few years?
Do we really need a whole new slate of films every year until the end of time? Not to mention new TV shows, limited series, comedy specials, and Youtube Premium (whatever that is). Even watching only the most lauded content every year would leave you at a loss, scrambling to find enough time to keep up with every major release. Others must also feel themselves drowning in a sea of must-watch movies, as I do.
For me, this is compounded by the fact that in every one of my film studies classes, some old professor is shaming me for not having seen every movie they want to reference, beyond the four to six films a week I watch for their classes. I’m sorry, but I haven’t had 50 or 60 years in which to see all that you’ve seen, prof! Not to mention friends and acquaintances insisting that I see this or that film, telling me I’d love it. I’m sure I’d love it, but I also need to sleep and eat.
I’m always being pulled in different directions. Should I watch a Bergman film that will awe and inspire me, or the latest Marvel movie so I can stay caught up with the industry and many of my peers? Or should I seek out an unknown documentary, to push the boundaries of my knowledge and formal vocabulary? In the end, I often give up and just rewatch “New Girl.”
It may seem strange for a film lover to beg for a halt to film production, but to me it is the only humane approach. We have enough content already! All the studios have massive piles of cash! Can’t we just all collectively agree to lay low for two to four years, and give those of us who need it time to catch up?
Those lucky enough to have been born early into the history of cinema must spare a thought for this younger generation: You only had 50 or so years of film to catch up on, while I have twice that! In calling for a pause, I think not only of myself, but also of the future cinephiles who will thank the foresight that allowed them to skip a couple of years in film history classes. I’m nearing my last straw! Which reminds me, I have to watch “Wild Strawberries” at some point…

We’ve all been there: The week before, you’d clicked “Interested” on a friend’s invitation to a student group’s event. “It’ll be fine,” you told yourself, despite the fact that you were drinking your third black coffee of the evening at 11 p.m. because you had an essay due in 10 hours. “It’s just a busy time of year is all, next week will be much lighter,” you foolishly assured yourself, somehow not realizing that you’d been saying the same thing since the second week of the semester.
Well, now it’s Judgment Day and Mark Zuckerberg himself is blowing up your phone to notify you that not only is the event of interest occuring in just an hour, but also that 15 of your best friends are going. Here are the top five reasons you can give them to excuse your absence, while avoiding social ruination:
5. “Something came up, sorry!”
Ah yes, old faithful. Vague enough that you can use it for just about anything, and uninteresting enough that no one will ever ask you what actually came up. Particularly useful for situations in which the something that came up is actually just you deciding you don’t feel like leaving wherever you are, or the paper that you’ve already known about for six weeks but still allowed to creep up on you.
4. “Oh no, was that tonight? I thought it was tomorrow!”
Full-bodied excuse with just a hint of nutty behavior. You of course knew exactly when the event would occur. What you did not know was how long it would take you to actually slog through that problem set, and now you’re so mentally exhausted that you’d prefer to stare at a wall and do nothing than go to another panel on the mating behavior of the Peregrine falcon, even if you promised your friend that you’d go. You live and die by your G-Cal — what’s a little “accidental” deletion between friends, anyway?
3. “I got swamped with work today — totally out of the blue!”
The best lies contain a grain of truth. Indeed, you were swamped with work, but you knew it was coming. You’ve known for weeks, perhaps for the entire semester, about this particular wave of work, but you’ve been so busy just barely keeping your head above water that you didn’t have time to prepare for it. It’s gotta get done, and maybe that means you’re not going to that Halloweekend pregame after all.
2. “I think I’m coming down with something, wouldn’t want to get you sick!”
It’s Sunday night, 9:58 p.m. Your Monday morning p-set isn’t looking as done as it needs to be, and the event starts in 17 minutes. You’re trying to decide between a life of social fulfillment and academic success, when — what’s that? Did you just sniffle? Well, you’d better stay in and work. Your illness may prevent you from socializing, but it’s not all bad: At least now you’ll get that p-set done in time. And if you feel totally fine tomorrow, well — hard work is the best medicine.
1. Absolute silence
I’m fully aware that most people don’t actually follow up on events they mark “Interested” on Facebook. I, too, usually just allow the notifications to fade into the void like so many motes of dust. Did I even once entertain the idea of actually going to any of these events? Perhaps, in another life. But not this one. In this life, there is no “going” to “events.” There is only “interest” in a version of reality where your fantasies of doing something that doesn’t require proximity to a library, caffeine, or both are anything more than idle dreams.
—Outgoing New Media Exec Noah F. Houghton ’20 has been labeled many things: A dreamer, a programmer, a writer, a hazard to public safety. He is on the Arts Board because he loves The Harvard Crimson and wants it to succeed. He would love to do things, but finds that he is paralyzed by his commitment to do the things he already has to do (of which there are many). In between attempting to use basic programming skills to make the AI from “Ex Machina” so that he can pass from this world in a suitably sexy and terrifying fashion, he attempts to convince brick walls that video games are art. He lives in Quincy House with 4 roommates and his crippling fear of irrelevance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus, three of indie music’s most compelling singer-songwriters, have recently blessed us by coming together to form a modern-day millennial supergroup. After teasing the masses with singles since late August, the trifecta perfecta finally dropped a gorgeous EP, christened “boygenius,” on all major streaming platforms, with the physical release slated for Nov. 9.
Prompted by this seismic collaboration, I have been musing over supergroups of yore, and how they stack up upon further inspection. I present to you Top Five: Supergroup Edition — with a few caveats. They are thus:
This was a tricky top five to assemble. I have left out collabs that are near and dear to my heart. But the rules of Top Five here on the esteemed Crimson Arts Blog are stringent, and savage cuts had to be made. Now, without further ado:
5. Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile
Album: “Lotta See Lice” (2017)
Listen to: “Continental Breakfast”
When these two cheeky troubadours came together last year for a joint release, it was exactly as breezy and clever as you would expect. Both artists thrive on delightfully disarming lyrics set to classic folk melodies, and the songs they produced together were quietly affecting, from the chummy warmth of “Continental Breakfast” to the twangy, poignant “Untogether.” This is modern cerebral Americana, delivered gorgeously by an Australian and an affable rock star. It helps that the two are great friends. With this kind of chemistry, Barnett and Vile better have some more music cooking.
4. The Raconteurs 
Albums: “Broken Boy Soldiers” (2006), “Consolers of the Lonely” (2008)
Listen to: “Steady, As She Goes”
It’s the thrilling Jack White collaboration you remember from the mid-aughts. No, the other one. Composed of Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler, both of The Greenhornes, as well as solo artist Brendan Benson and, of course, modern rock hero Jack White, The Raconteurs made some seriously good music together. They also were pioneers of the Surprise Album Drop years before Beyoncé made it cool. White would go on to develop his critically acclaimed solo career, and the band’s other members faded from the front pages of Pitchfork — but rumor has it they’re back in the studio, with a release slated for 2019.
3. Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus
Album: “boygenius” (2018)
Listen to: “Ketchum, ID”
In my humble opinion, we’ve got a record of the year on our hands. “boygenius” came together after these three rising stars booked a tour together and were inspired by their collective anticipation to knock out this devastatingly beautiful six-piece set in just a few days. While all three women are crushing the indie rock game right now, gender be damned, the title of their collaboration is too sly to ignore: Maybe as one, they’ll finally be seen as just one of the boys. And there’s nothing they’d want less. Come for the moody, radio-ready “Me and My Dog,” but stay for the stunning harmonies on “Ketchum, ID.”
2. Postal Service 
Album: “Give Up” (2003)
Listen to: “We Will Become Silhouettes”
Now is the time where I should probably disclose my angsty adolescent infatuation with Death Cab for Cutie. But this collaboration between DC4C frontman Ben Gibbard, electronica artist Jimmy Tamborello, and Rilo Kiley vocalist/solo legend Jenny Lewis was objectively hard to ignore. You’ve probably heard Postal Service’s pop-tinged emo creations on every TV soundtrack from the last 15 years ever, or maybe a very hip elevator, but “Such Great Heights,” that iconic mid-2000s earworm, stands the test of time. Also, the actual United States Postal Service sent them a cease-and-desist letter, which is quite punk.
1. Kanye West and Jay-Z
Album: “Watch the Throne”
Listen to: “No Church in the Wild"
Could it be anything else? Rarely do two artists with such genre-surpassing cultural firepower join forces to drop a full-length album, but thank the Lord for the real rap gods. Some may argue that these tracks simply do not stand up individually against either of the artist’s best solo work. I say, it doesn’t matter. This album captured the zeitgeist like few other collaborations ever have or will. Are they a supergroup? Perhaps not. But that two rap titans came together to give the people exactly what they wanted, and dropped some of the most iconic songs of the decade while they were at it, cannot be disputed. And that’s pretty super.
Honorable Mentions: The Notable Danger Mouse Projects
Broken Bells
Albums: “Broken Bells” (2010), “After the Disco” (2014)
Listen to: “The Ghost Inside”
The Shins frontman James Mercer and perennial collaborator Danger Mouse were electric together. I would have ranked them on the actual list, except that I’m not sure Danger Mouse’s solo career fits my demanding criteria. Nevertheless, Broken Bells is worthy of existing at least somewhere in the collaborative canon.
Gnarls Barkley
Albums: “St. Elsewhere” (2006), “The Odd Couple” (2008)
Listen to: “Crazy”
Cee Lo Green and producer Danger Mouse’s collaboration would be relatively forgettable if they hadn’t produced one of the greatest songs of all time, and also the first song I ever bought on iTunes. If anyone cares.

Before I take over as The Crimson’s new TV executive, I think it’s important for my readers to know where I stand: I don’t know anything about TV, because I only watch British period dramas. This curated list features my favorite ones and what I would rename them if I had power — which, thank God, I don’t. Now you will understand why all TV coverage going forward will be period dramas. It will also help my 12 boyfriends understand why I only wear powdered wigs and petticoats.
“War and Peace” (“Hats and Robes”)
If you love Lily James and hate Paul Dano, this is the show for you. Based on Tolstoy's epic novel, “War and Peace” traces the fates of three Russian aristocratic families during the Napoleonic War. Across six glorious episodes, watch them fall in love, commit incest, kill each other, and wear the largest collection of hats and silk printed robes of all time. Seriously, they even wear robes to duel. Watch it for the exquisite acting or for the fur caps — either way, you will hate Paul Dano even more than before.
“Parade’s End” (“Celibacy 101 with Benebund Cumberbutch”)
“Parade’s End” isn’t just about WWI — it’s also about Benedict Cumberbatch’s character’s celibacy. For the 4.783-hour duration of the series watch him NOT sleep with any of his love interests and continually question his integrity. Otherwise enjoy the beautiful shots of English country homes and wallpaper in this delicate love story paired with a powerful exploration of England’s dissolving class structure.
“Tess of the D’Urbervilles" (“Extremely Long & Incredibly Filmed”)
In “Tess of the D’Urbervilles,” the formidable Gemma Arterton stars as the eponymous character with sensitivity and whimsy, breathing new life into the role. The series features the most idyllic shots of the West country and also a fantastic soundtrack. While it has faults — namely Eddie Redmayne’s waistcoats and awful special effects — it is, as we say around the Arts board, flawed but compelling.
"And Then There Were None" ("Sexy Asphyxiation")
In 2015, BBC struck with a vengeance with its spooky adaptation of Agatha Christie’s classic mystery. When a mysterious stranger invites ten people to a deserted island, it is revealed that each of them has committed a deadly crime and must be punished. Over three riveting episodes, the guests (played by the most beautiful cast ever) are brutally murdered one by one. They begin to suspect foul play mainly because they are being brutally murdered one by one. It is both violent and sexy, with every shot featuring either blood, extended shadows or a good-looking actor’s brooding profile. This one is sure to give you and all my boyfriends nightmares.
“Howards End” (“My Dearest Boi”)
“Howards End” follows the eccentric lives of the bohemian Schlegel orphans as they mess up everybody’s lives. Pretty much everyone they encounter either dies or falls into poverty. Prepare to shudder through every single one of their unintentionally calamitous actions and to flinch every single time Hayley Atwell’s character calls her husband “my dearest boy,” which makes me think of this clever internet meme. Either way it’s weird. I am also shamelessly promoting my review.
—Staff writer Aline G. Damas can be reached at aline.damas@thecrimson.com. She didn’t include BBC’s 1995 adaptation of “Pride and Prejudice” because she doesn’t like it. Fight her.

Alternatively titled: “I Went to College and All I Got Was This English Major’s Tote Bag and a Lot of Bad Movie Ideas.” Put that on a t-shirt.
“Down”
Set 20 years after its beloved predecessor, “Up,” “Down” follows Russell, an upshot investment banker working the fast-paced life of Wall Street. But after working 15-hour work days for the past 27 weeks, Russell realizes that he’s feeling a little… well, down. He grabs a handful of robin’s egg blue balloons from a high-end department store’s grand opening. “Suck it losers! I’m going on an adventure!” he screams, as he floats out of the city Mary Poppins style. “Someone feed my dog!”
(Yes, Dug is still alive. This is the future. Modern medicine is amazing.)
“Finding Marlin”
Marlin is a down-on-his-luck, fresh-out-of-college clownfish working on his neverending screenplay in the glittering waters of Los Angelfish. But after getting rejection after rejection for his thriller-horror-mystery “With fronds like these, who needs anemones?,” Marlin decides it’s time to give up, and move onto greater reefs. That is, until his best friend Coral (spoiler alert: she dies) convinces him that all he needs is inspiration from greater life experiences than the numerous Blue Bottle Coffees and literal blue bottles (don’t litter kids!) he writes his screenplay in. Together, they set out on a quest, finding inspiration, love, and — in one particularly philosophical monologue that’s jam-packed with more nautical puns than this synopsis — even Marlin himself. Soon, they’ll realize the true screenplay was the friends they made along the way.
“Monsters University 2”
It’s interview season, and the monsters at Monsters University are thriving! At least, that’s what they want you to believe. If Sulley’s greatest strength is scaring his roommate Mike out of bed and his greatest weakness is “perfectionism,” which kitchen appliance would he be? Defend your answer with your firmest handshake.
“Outside In”
The gang’s getting some new members. After Riley finishes her sophomore year of high school, a bunch of new emotions are joining the crew, like: “The awkward feeling you get after your two best friends go out for lunch without you,” and “The sense of betrayal after discovering your best friends’ secret romantic relationship,” and “An eerily calm acceptance as you designate yourself as the perpetual third wheel.” Riley’s friend group may now be ruined, but at least Joy has some new teammates!
“The Not-so-Incredible Sequel”
You’ve heard of Elastigirl’s mindblowing flexibility and Mr. Incredible’s awesome strength, but have you heard of… Sharon? The semi-distant cousin of the Parr family, Sharon Parr is… well, she’s just a person. Not that that’s a bad thing! Honestly, Sharon’s been living her best life. She just got a promotion, the kids are doing great, and the other night, she got to finally see the new Avengers movie! Good job, Sharon! Go you!
“Cars 2,” “Cars 3,” “Planes”
Oh no, these never happened.
—Outgoing Chair Grace Z. Li vows to dedicate her Academy Award-winning Pixar sequels to her co-Chair’s progeny, including but not limited to Mila Gauvin XVII, Mila Gauvin 1½ , and Mila Gauvin: The Holiday Sequel.

“Crazy Rich Asians,” “Fresh Off the Boat,” and “To All The Boys I Used to Love,” or whatever it’s called, never stood a chance. They were respectable attempts, for sure. Ultimately, however, they fell short of their goal, which was to create a single artwork that would accurately epitomize the lived experience of every English-speaking person on earth who traces their ancestry to Asia. Only one entity has triumphed. It’s called “subtle asian traits,” and it is peerless.
This bold artistic production follows the intertwining journeys of 633,802 members of the Asian diaspora as they abandon their solitary college lives to join the quest for pan-Asian harmony. Unflinching in its writing, the broadcast answers hard questions like “What does it mean to be part of the Asian diaspora?” (materialistic and addicted to milk tea), “What does an Asian person look like?” (at least two shades lighter than original milk tea), and “Are South Asians Asian?” (lmao, no).
Because its dethroned cultural predecessor “Crazy Rich Asians” set a high standard for respectful representation of South Asian people, “subtle asian traits” followed suit. Such characters are allowed brief, repetitive cameos to point out that they don’t understand Chinese — duh! They were never supposed to feel included in this narrative. They are there to add color to the otherwise identical cast of 720,587.
In another impressive delegation of roles, the show’s insecure Asian male actors frequently perform blackness. Cross-cultural casting is the best.
Also brimming with meaning are the costumes. The protagonists — the Four Types of Asian Females — have dazzlingly long and straight hair. This recalls the real-life appearances of the bougie Australian champagne-and-corsage-bearing producers, and also communicates the dazzling straightness of aforementioned characters.
The cultural touchstone debuted in September and is well into the exposition of its 790,315 characters’ tragic backstories. To push forward the dramatic arc, the most recent episode introduced some self-righteous dumb white people. They formerly appeared as silent extras, but they now interject with comebacks such as “Lmao I can’t even. Please get over yourselves.” The white people’s subversive presence in the narrative serves as a heart-wrenching allegory for colonization, and only time will tell where the script takes this new source of friction.
“subtle asian traits” has finally proven that great art can be activism. Long forgotten are “The Joy Luck Club,” “All American Girl,” and the dystopian courtroom drama “SFFA v. Harvard.” The claim that Asians are apolitical can now be refuted by the image of 812,855 Asian students glued to their screens for nine hours a day as they stay up-to-date on the most important Asian creation ever circulated, a vision of progress itself. Any viewers who find its writing offensive have also been gifted a new cause. Their sarcastic comments contribute to productive conversation and mark a good use of their time, because lambasting a meme group is actually the ultimate activist deed.
—Staff writer Liana E. Chow once cried looking at a Rothko. She has concluded from comparing her life to “subtle asian traits” that she must not be Asian and now prefers to identify only as the incoming Theater Exec and Comp Director. Still, she longs to see a subtle Asian meme that will make her say “literally me” and will gladly evaluate any contenders sent to liana.chow@thecrimson.com.

This is not the top five list that you’re expecting. “Eye of the Tiger” makes no appearance on it, nor does “Another One Bites the Dust.” Here is an alternative list, one that will not only motivate you to study, but maybe to have a little tap-dance break as well. I present five songs to get you through finals — show tunes edition.
“Non-Stop” (“Hamilton”)
Let’s start, of course, with the quintessential American masterpiece of the 21st century: “Hamilton.” This song, the explosive conclusion to Act 1 of the musical, has it all — catchy repeated phrases, intense rap breaks, and historical narration that is intense enough to have you screaming along, “Hamilton wrote...THE OTHER FIFTY-ONE.”
“Watch What Happens” (“Newsies”)
Katherine Plumber has a story to write — a story that has to single-handedly save the newsies’ strike. You have a paper to write — a paper that has to single-handedly bring your Expos 20 grade up to an A-. Listen to Jack Feldman’s witty, clever, internal-rhyming lyrics set to Alan Menken’s always catchy music.
“One Day More” (“Les Misérables”)
Otherwise known as what you ask your professor for when you haven’t started your final project and it’s the day before it’s due. The entire cast of the epic musical classic unites for an explosive number in preparation for their final battle whose conclusion will determine their fate. Sound familiar?
“Chip on My Shoulder” (“Legally Blonde”)
You can’t be a Harvard student with a musical playlist without including something from “Legally Blonde.” Elle Woods transforms into the top law student in her class, all within the span of this nine-minute narrative-song — the exact sort of montage you need for your all-night study session.
“My Shot” (“Hamilton”)
When a musical manages to win eleven Tony awards, it deserves a second spot on this list. Listen as Lin-Manuel Miranda goes off for five minutes of pure inspiration and motivation. Finals only come once per semester. Perhaps if you hear “I am not throwing away my shot,” enough times, you’ll take advantage of yours.

Over the past several years, Disney has embarked on a project of remaking old animated classics in live-action form. A live-action “Cinderella” was released in 2015, and “Beauty and the Beast” starred Emma Watson in 2017. Disney’s remake agenda for the next two years includes, among others, “Aladdin,” “The Lion King,” “Mulan,” and — wait for it — “Dumbo.”
I’m with you, Disney: There are no new ideas. But why limit ourselves to remaking animated films as live action? Why not go the other direction as well? Here is a list of five perfectly good live-action and computer-generated imagery (CGI) movies that need to be remade as old-style, pixelated animations. And soon.
1. “La La Land”
Heartbreaking moments aside, it’s hard to get through those sequences of Californians dancing on colorful cars or perfect couples floating through the air without thinking at least once, “Are those real people, or classic Disney princesses recreated with advanced CGI technology?” This film is first on the list, honestly, because the change might not be that hard.
2. “12 Angry Men”
Picture a movie which features 12 men in nearly identical suits, takes place entirely in one room, and depends largely on dialogue and folded paper to keep the plot moving. Now picture it animated. Better, right? Besides, the younger demographic that animation attracts has yet to experience the pain of being called for jury duty, so is really better positioned to appreciate this classic script than an adult audience anyhow.
3. “Avatar”
This movie was all about CGI. Its breakthroughs in computer animation arguably paved the way for these subsequent Disney remakes. Now is the time to strip it of that CGI, and let the movie’s brilliant, completely unproblematic plot speak for itself.
4. “The Godfather”
Nothing calls for animation like organized crime. Sure, the film’s protagonists have a lot on their plates what with the warring families, cops, drugs and general death and deception. But if a few talking mice (rats) and tweeting birds (pigeons) were hanging around to serenade them and help everyone get dressed, everyone in the Corleone family might have had a much better time.
5. “High School Musical”
Already a true Disney classic — and don’t you dare claim this one isn’t “high-quality.” This remake would be worth it just to see Zac Efron’s 2006 hair in animated form.
6. “Jaws”
Imagine “Jaws,” but the shark is Bruce from “Finding Nemo.” Play that classic theme song in your head and then chant “fish are friends, not food” to the beat. Tell me that doesn’t sound like more fun.
Honorable Mentions: “A Star is Born,” “The Shape of Water,” “Casablanca,” “Back to the Future,” “A Streetcar Named Desire,” “Back to the Future II,” “Jaws 2.”
—Outgoing Columns Exec Yael M. Saiger can be reached at yael.saiger@thecrimson.com. She is excitedly awaiting the “Dumbo” remake and writes articles to distract herself from the burgeoning anticipation.

In the sea of midterms, empty Red Bull cans, and broken dreams that is college, one must seek out the simple joys of daily life just to survive. After three semesters of searching, I can confidently say that I have found something that motivates me to get out of bed each morning, and that thing is clicking “Arts” on The Harvard Crimson’s website just to see the words “Internal Server Error” light up my screen.
Don’t take this the wrong way. I love reading Crimson Arts. Who else has the journalistic integrity to weigh in once and for all on the merits of Shrek vs. Shrek 2 or on the fame and female competition behind Cardi B’s shoe toss? It might be Stockholm Syndrome, but I’ve come to see the error message as a true work of Art — one that transcends the capabilities of even our most eloquent, experienced staff writers. Poetic lines like “The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request” and “More information about this error may be available in the server error log” demonstrate literary talent akin to that of a Nobel Laureate.
The message starts off a bit slow — it usually takes between two and 10 minutes to fully load — but it’s well worth the wait. Kazimir Malevich may have had his “Black Square” and Ellsworth Kelly his ”White and Black,“ but neither artist can compare to the stark and unparallelled minimalism of “Internal Server Error.” The contrast of black, serif font on its white background is a clear critique of the capitalist sympathies of more colorful websites. “Server Error” even takes it a step farther, rebelling against the capitalist system by avoiding the market entirely. All you have to do to get a copy for yourself is hit “Print.”
The only possible reason I can come up with to explain how this masterpiece hasn’t already been installed in a special exhibition gallery at MoMA is that it has so far been too elusive for art collectors to get their hands on. To seek it out, one must first weigh the chance of viewing a landmark piece of contemporary art against that of being forced to peruse the product of hours of hard and heartfelt work from a staff of talented and dedicated Arts writers and editors. Previous attempts to obtain “Internal Server Error” have resulted in some of the nation’s most respected collectors, dealers, and art historians doing the unthinkable: actually reading Crimson Arts.
To put an end to this, I have taken it upon myself to volunteer three minutes — that’s right, 180 whole seconds — of my day to preserve “Internal Server Error” for future generations. My self-funded, self-conducted research has made it possible to absorb the captivating beauty of “Server Error” without even the smallest risk of hearing about Banksy's latest antics. If my efforts are successful, no one, including myself, will have to read Crimson Arts ever again!

It's cuffing season — here are 36 Arts questions guaranteed to find you love.
1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want to serve you a lukewarm PBR?

3. Before Arts meetings, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?
4. What constitutes a perfect Fleetwood Mac song for you?

7. If there can be 100 people in a room and 99 won’t believe in you, do you have a secret hunch about who the one is?
8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common. (One must be a Monty Python reference.)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, at a party, I submitted to the disc jockey a daring request: I inquired if he had the fortitude to play Lou Bega’s “Mambo No. 5.”
“Sorry, we don’t play that kind of music,” he plebishly replied. “The kids don’t like that kind of stuff.” As I moped away, I heard “Dance Yrself Clean” by LCD Soundsystem blare over the speakers. The sheeple ate it up.
Our society has sunk to cultural depths that would make the Founding Fathers shudder. Bland, unoriginal music like Haydn and Beethoven dominate Harvard’s music scene, and it seems like some students — though I hesitate even to call them that — listen to nothing else. I think that’s pathetic.
“Music” groups like Steely Dan are so successful because they produce catchy music, stuff you don’t have to think about, even though it’s not good, deep stuff like “Don’t Stop Believin’” by Journey. You all as a society have lost your way. Even though good, real music exists, your indifference has stunted careers, nearly preventing real artists’ work from ever getting to the ears of music savants like myself. Just think of how musically bereft we would be if not for Barenaked Ladies’ “One Week.”
How did we get here? All social catastrophes begin somewhere. I personally blame the British. Their thirst for revenge after losing the American Revolution led them to export artists all the way to the States to water down the quality of our music. Soon, deep artists like Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins became The Who and — ugh — The Beatles. The Beatles perfected the method of blandness, releasing the same album 12 times. Americans ate it up, setting the stage for our nation’s downfall. We live in a time where talentless artists like Frank Ocean and Death Grips can release whatever they want and it will sell big because you all are too stupid to know the difference.
But together, you all can change! Some of the most iconic songs of all time — “Burnin’ Up” (Jonas Brothers), “Stacy’s Mom” (Fountains of Wayne), “1985” (Bowling for Soup) — were created by a couple Americans exercising the heights of their literary wit. People like you (the reader) have helped erode the significance of these masterpieces through your frivolous obsession with The Smiths. You must see the error of your ways because, for far too long, good music has had to suffer at the hands of this utter garbage.
I do not believe that you should only listen to high art. Sometimes, drivel like Led Zeppelin can be rewarding. But we should not restrict ourselves to only the simple, catchy music we hear at parties. If we do that, then we lose the opportunity to hear prodigies like the Bee Gees.
The musical dullness society created is an utter monstrosity. You all must reckon with what you have done. I challenge you to peruse truly adventurous music. Listen to “All Star” by Smash Mouth. Then look up “Mambo No. 5” and immerse yourself in actual music.

10. “The Hate U Give”
Though it might seem like just another YA novel-turned-movie, “The Hate U Give” strives to take a critical look at two communities — a wealthy white neighborhood and a poor, mostly black one — through the eyes of teenager Starr Carter (Amanda Stenberg), who is caught between both: the former where she attends school and the latter where she lives with her family. After she witnesses the tragic shooting of her friend, a black teenager, at the hands of a white police officer, Starr faces pressure from both of her communities but must ultimately learn to fight for the truth. —Aline G. Damas
We reviewed “The Hate U Give” and gave it 4.5/5 stars. Read more here.
9. “Sorry To Bother You”
“Sorry to Bother You” (2018) weaves a tale of the corrupting influence of late-stage capitalism on the human spirit. Writer-director Boots Riley brings viewers into the world of telemarketer Cassius “Cash” Green (Lakeith Stanfield). After Cassius discovers his “white voice,” he is propelled to greater and greater riches — all while his sense of morality and loyalty to his community erodes. A combination of magical realism and hard truths, this dramatic film explores the intersection of race, class, and wealth in the 21st century. It’ll leave you entertained and unsettled. —Noah F. Houghton
8. “Love, Simon”
One of the most anticipated films by the BGLTQ community this year, “Love, Simon” tells the coming out story of high schooler Simon Spier (Nick Robinson). Directed by Greg Berlanti, the film snagged several Teen Choice Award titles and was nominated for the People’s Choice Awards. When we reviewed the film earlier this year, we called it “nothing new” but also praised “Love, Simon” for capturing seemingly mundane moments and normalizing BGLTQ romances. Based on the book “Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda” by Becky Albertalli, “Love, Simon” traces the first love in a teenage-glazed rom com — though it sometimes “forgets it’s a coming out story.” —Lucy Wang
We reviewed "Love, Simon" and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here.
7. “Avengers: Infinity War”
The event movie to end all event movies, “Avengers: Infinity War” trashes everything we’ve learned to expect from films (Who needs character development when you have 79 years of comics and 18 movies to work off of?) in favor of pure maximalism. In two and a half hours, it transforms its teeming dramatis personae into the modern mythological figures everyone always compares them to. (Does a child sacrifice on the mountain sound familiar?) Sure, the movie’s missing a last act, and Thanos isn’t that deep, but it’s hard to pause and nitpick when the adrenaline is rushing this relentlessly. —Jonathan P. Trang
We reviewed “Avengers: Infinity War” and gave it 3/5 stars. Read more here.
6. “Eighth Grade”
Movies love reimagining the “unpopular kid” into stylish, witty, minimally-awkward leads. But that’s not Kayla Day (Elsie Fisher), our Hollister-wearing, vlog-filming, Gen Z heroine. “Eighth Grade” is painfully sharp with the loneliness Kayla feels from her failed attempts at friendship. But it also glows with her strength, culminating in a beautiful, unpolished, unchoreographed outburst right before middle school graduation. “Eighth Grade” doesn’t want to set unrealistic expectations of a better tomorrow, but it wants to give you hope — and that’s somehow kinder. “You never know what’s next,” Kayla says. “And that’s what makes things exciting, and scary, and fun.” —Grace Z. Li
We reviewed “Eighth Grade” and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here. We also chatted with its director, Bo Burnham.
5. “Manbiki Kazoku” (“Shoplifters”)
The heartbreaking story of a Tokyo family living in poverty who must steal for subsistence won the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, “Shoplifters” follows a family who adopts an abused young girl and takes her into their makeshift home. With its slow-building tenderness and artful cinematography, the film would already be a triumph — but its greatest strength is its climactic unraveling of the truth, which Kore-eda gently teases out, revealing the dark secrets underpinning the family’s unconventional arrangement. “Shoplifters” examines the ethical limits of love and family with immense care. —Caroline A. Tsai
We gave “Shoplifters” 4/5 stars. Read more here.
4. “A Star is Born”
“A Star is Born,” starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is a remake of a 1937 (and 1954, and 1976) drama that few asked for but almost everybody appreciates. The film follows powerhouse singer Ally Campana (Gaga) as she gets “discovered” by country-rock star Jackson Maine (Cooper) — and as she ultimately begins to eclipse him. “A Star is Born” has been lauded for Lady Gaga’s sparse singing style and Cooper’s earnest take on the original plotline. The New York Times made the movie a Critic’s Pick, praising it as one woman’s journey “toward fabulous self and sovereignty.” —Iris M. Lewis
We reviewed “A Star is Born” and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here.
3. “Incredibles 2”
“Incredibles 2” is super fun. For any children meeting this superhero family for the first time, there are plenty of reasons to delight in this 14-year-awaited sequel, from the antics of baby Jack-Jack to the perfect pacing. Meanwhile, 20-year-old audience members on nostalgia trips can appreciate the upgraded animation, which perfects frustrated facial expressions and boosts chase scenes to maximum excitement, along with the faithful continuations and developments of familiar characters. All this works at the service of a power-to-the-people, anti-corporation, anti-regulation, anti-screen narrative, but its most convincing message is that sequels can sometimes succeed. —Liana E. Chow
We gave “Incredibles 2” 4/5 stars in July. Read more here.
2. “Crazy Rich Asians”
This summer’s blockbuster was a landmark win for onscreen diversity. “Crazy Rich Asians,” based on the bestselling novel by Kevin Kwan, was the first major picture to star an all-Asian cast in a contemporary setting in 25 years. Critics heralded the film for its portrayal of the Asian-American experience, as well as exceptional performances by Constance Wu, Michelle Yeoh, and newcomer Henry Golding. The film was not only a victory for Asian representation, but also a big-hearted (not to mention big-budgeted) romantic comedy. It also swept at the box office, grossing $236.5 million worldwide. Crazy rich, indeed. —Caroline A. Tsai
Earlier this summer, we talked about why loving “Crazy Rich Asians” was crazy complicated. Read the thinkpiece here. We also interviewed several of the cast members.
1. “Black Panther”
“Black Panther” was met with rave reviews and is to date not only the highest-grossing film of the year but also the third-highest of all time. Set in the fictional African country of Wakanda, the story follows King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), and his alter-ego Black Panther, as he protects his country in the face of a power struggle. Written and directed by Ryan Coogler and with a stellar cast including Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira, the film has been hailed as a long-overdue triumph of black representation in superhero movies and lauded for giving fans new role models within the Marvel Universe. —Yael M. Saiger
We reviewed “Black Panther” and gave it 4.5/5 stars. Read more here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first comped Arts my freshman fall, I experienced the first of many inundations of overplayed, overrated songs. When several writers or compers want to pick up the same pitch, one song and one song only is constantly in play: Europe’s “The Final Countdown.” In my small comp class of 10 elected compers — in which, fun fact, my name was misspelled in the announcement! — picking up pitches wasn’t as competitive. But considering how much Arts has grown since then, it’s come to be a… tedious tradition, to say the least. And just because it’s tradition doesn’t make it right. Here is my case against “The Final Countdown” as The Crimson Arts’ unofficially official fight song.
3. The Never-Ending Intro
The song’s intro lasts a whopping one minute and 26 seconds. By my calculations, each round of Rock, Paper, Scissors (the definitive means by which writers and compers battle it out for a pitch) lasts two seconds. If we’re lucky and get a whole three rounds — we do best two out of three, to make things fair — that’s six seconds. That would mean it would take at least 14 contested pitches to make it to the song’s first words. Now, unless we’re in the final week of the comp and all our execs pitch out are f-bombs — features, of course — such a scenario is unlikely to happen. The solution is clear: Down with “The Final Countdown.”
2. The Band Europe
Umm… This is America. Childish Gambino said so. ‘Nuff said.
1. “The Final Countdown” to… What?
Now correct me if I’m wrong, but Rock, Paper, Scissors is a fight to the metaphorical death for a much desired pitch. So what are we counting down to? The aforementioned metaphorical death? The start of each round of Rock, Paper, Scissors? The END of each round? A true fight song must capture the aggression, the bloodshed, the pain of the fight. To focus on the lead-up to an undefined part of said fight defeats the purpose of the song entirely.
But fear not. Trust that I won’t leave you without some alternatives:
Option A: Lorde’s “Glory and Gore.” The title says it all. This song is both by Lorde, our Queen, and beautifully encapsulates the violence inherent in Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Option B: Kendrick Lamar’s “BLOOD.” “Are we going to live or die?” goes the intro. That’s the attitude compers and writers need to have going into Rock, Paper, Scissors. The song’s calming instrumentalization might help fighters focus, before the climactic ending that reflects the tense final round of the game.
No need to thank me for these recommendations. Consider this my final gift as Chair to Arts.

10. “Expectations” by Hayley Kiyoko
From Hayley Kiyoko to Troye Sivan to SOPHIE, 2018 has been a breakthrough year for BGLTQ pop stars publicly embracing the spotlight in affirming ways. Kiyoko in particular has succeeded in the captivating specificity of her album “Expectations,” sliding in subtle details that perfectly capture every narrative moment. From the vulnerability of the line “I only want a girl who ain’t afraid to love me / Not a metaphor of what we really could be” on “What I Need” to the sheer pettiness of “You say you wanted me, but you’re sleeping with him” on “Curious,” Kiyoko’s clever lyrics and catchy melodies are as cool as they are affirming, fun to sing along to and deeply relatable at the same time. —Edward M. Litwin
We reviewed "Expectations" and gave it 4/5 stars. Read more here.
9. “Golden Hour” by Kacey Musgraves
“Golden Hour” is immaculately constructed, effortlessly blending country with a hint of ’80s pop. It’s an album about finding yourself in the midst of the whirlwind of life and though it’s subdued in tone, every line is fierce and biting. Kacey Musgraves brings her signature wit and focus to this masterpiece to create her best album yet. Between the woozy disco peak of “High Horse” and the detached repulsion of “Space Cowboy,” “Golden Hour” takes its listener on a journey that ultimately shows them everything will be alright in the end. —Edward M. Litwin
8. “High as Hope” by Florence + the Machine
Florence Welch may still be learning to accept herself but she is done accepting less than she deserves. These feelings underscore her band’s empowering and ethereal fourth studio album “High as Hope.” Her voice is front, center, and more personal than it has been on any of her albums yet, trading in symbolism and metaphor for self-reflection and simple melodies. She sings of her struggles with an eating disorder (“Hunger”) and toxic relationships (“Big God”), but also of home (“South London Forever”), her sister (“Grace”), and even Patti Smith (“Patricia”). In its intense vulnerability, “High as Hope” is beautiful. —Allison J. Scharmann
7. “Astroworld” by Travis Scott
“Astroworld” is “Infinity War: The Album”: Everywhere you turn in this sprawling, thrilling carnival, you’re likely to spot a favorite figure. Frank Ocean croons the hook to “Carousel” as his “Blonde”-era, pitched-up vocals swirl around him. The Weeknd does his louche castrato routine over Tame Impala’s signature psychedelia (“Skeletons”) and John Mayer’s slow-jam strumming (“Wake Up”). Drake somehow made everyone at every party in the last half of 2018 rap along to a verse about sleeping on a plane. And Travis, the glue that holds it all together, is Captain America: His gift for collaboration makes up for his obnoxious blandness, and he’s got hidden depths, whether he’s being tender and introspective or paying tribute to his hometown, Houston. —Jonathan P. Trang
6. “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino” by Arctic Monkeys
Arctic Monkeys came back from a post-tour, two-year hiatus to record and release their first album since 2013’s “AM.” “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino” marks a major departure from the British band’s punk and indie rock roots. Lead singer Alex Turner’s characteristic vocals take on an unexpectedly languid and haunting tone, grounding the abstract lyrics and spacey melodies of tracks like “Star Treatment” and “Golden Trunks.” Arctic Monkeys may have let down fans expecting something more similar to their previous work, but in doing so flexed their songwriting and instrumental skills in an impressive, experimental foray into glam-rock. —Allison J. Scharmann
We gave “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino” 4 stars. Read about it here.
5. “Be the Cowboy” by Mitski
The fifth studio album from singer-songwriter Mitski Miyawaki arrived in a swirl of lush sonic experimentation and intense honesty. It is both a work of channeling an alternate persona, as Mitski herself indicated to Fact Magazine, and stripping back the layers of façade to reveal an intense vulnerability. This Mitski is both “the idiot with a painted face” in “Me and My Husband” and the insecure lover who pleads, “Would you tell me if you want me?” in “Come Into the Water.” Brutal honesty is a throughline of “Be the Cowboy,” whether it’s in the form of anxiety or swaggering confidence. —Caroline A. Tsai

4. “Black Panther: The Album”
While the movie "Black Panther” made history this year with its casting and sales, its soundtrack made similar waves within the music industry with its original score composed by Ludwig Göransson and original songs produced by rapper Kendrick Lamar. While Göransson’s score is largely based on traditional African music, Lamar derived most of his inspiration from the ’90s, though several songs feature African drum beats and one of them has Zulu lyrics. He collaborated with artists like SZA, Jorja Smith, Vince Staples, and The Weeknd to create pop-rap hits "All the Stars” and “Pray for Me,” among many others. The album was not only critically acclaimed, but also snagged the coveted number one spot on the US Billboard 200. —Aline G. Damas
We enjoyed “Black Panther: The Album,” giving it 4 stars. Read more here.
3. “Invasion of Privacy” by Cardi B
Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” dominated the Billboard Hot 100 — it’s now the “longest number one solo single by a female rapper” — but it was just the beginning of the Bronx-born rapper’s rise to fame. Her album “Invasion of Privacy” was released to popular and critical acclaim, an impressive debut featuring the likes of Chance the Rapper, SZA, and Bad Bunny on infectious tracks “Best Life,” “I Do,” and “I Like It,” respectively. She’s at her best on every single track: sharp and empowered at her most upbeat and unflinchingly self-assured even at her most vulnerable. —Allison J. Scharmann
2. “Dirty Computer” by Janelle Monae
“I’m not America’s nightmare / I am the American dream,” Janelle Monáe sings on “Crazy, Classic Life,” the second track of her third album. “Dirty Computer” itself is a type of dream come true. Monáe has spun a world in which liberation for queer and black people arrives caressed by the embrace of sex positivity. Stevie Wonder offers words of comfort, human-as-computer metaphors glide over Brian Wilson’s harmonies, and delectable riffs like the one in “PYNK” (featuring Grimes) marry funk and pop and R&B. This is an American dream that’s not hard to get behind. —Liana E. Chow
We reviewed “Dirty Computer” and gave it 4.5/5 stars. Find out why here.
1. “Sweetener” by Ariana Grande
Ariana Grande has been no stranger to success throughout her career, but she finally found her voice with her fourth album, “Sweetener.” Produced and co-written by Pharrell Williams, it features her most experimental soundtracks yet, giving her pop repertoire a charmingly unique sound that hinges on lowkey beats and sing-talking. Through the exploration of anxiety, the conflation of religious and sexual passion, and the expression of autobiographical heartbreak, Grande offers up a confident and honest statement that strengthens her position as a pop queen. —Kaylee S. Kim
Sections
10. “Kim’s Convenience” (Season One and Two American debut in 2018, Canadian premiere in 2016)
Based on Ins Choi’s 2011 play, “Kim’s Convenience” centers around one small enclave of the Korean diaspora, a Korean-Canadian family’s corner convenience store. There are the expected (and delightful) mini-dramas and shenanigans, like when Umma (Jean Yoon) recruits her estranged son for a church singing competition, only for them to give a feeble performance. But the sitcom’s real edge is its unanticipated bittersweetness: Later, the show is saved when Appa (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) secretly joins in from backstage, his low voice regretful over his son’s banishment. For the most part, “Kim’s Convenience” is happy fun. But its quieter moments will leave you reeling. —Grace Z. Li
9. “GLOW,” Season Two
In 1980s Los Angeles, a ragtag group of women get a new lease on life when they join the cast of a new wrestling program, the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). In the second season of this neon-colored, campy romp, the fledgling performers fight to stay on air and begin to own the absurd stereotypes they’ve assumed as their wrestling personas. Amid the dramatic clashing of egos and creative ambitions, the characters grapple with the politics of workplace sexual harassment and assert their female agency. This season, they’ve proved themselves homegrown underdogs with big dreams, and thankfully show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. —Claire N. Park
8. “Big Mouth,” Season Two
Returning for a second season, the Netflix animated comedy “Big Mouth” tells the story of how puberty ravages a group of middle school students. All-star voice talent, including John Mulaney, Fred Armisen, and Maya Rudolph, and a writers room led by industry veterans Nick Kroll and “Family Guy” alum Andrew Goldberg make this prurient show about sexual awakenings, periods, and social jockeying one of Netflix’s more successful original cartoons. It revels in off-color humor and sometimes-insightful commentary on the social mores about growing up, and what it means to become an adult. —Noah F. Houghton
We reviewed the second season and found it enjoyable and honest. Read more here.
7. “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Season Two
“The Handmaid’s Tale’” is set in a dystopian version of the United States, renamed Gilead, in which women are relegated to the status of objects. The Emmy award-winning first season, which aired in April 2017, felt relevant as issues of sexism and sexual assault emerged to the forefront of national discussion. The first season also seemed to play out most of the plot of the Margaret Atwood novel that was the show’s inspiration, which left people apprehensive about what might come next. The second season is equally dark, trapping protagonist June (Elisabeth Moss) in the same place where she started. —Yael M. Saiger
We reviewed the second season but found it disappointing and frustrating. Read our episode-by-episode coverage here.
6. “Atlanta,” Season Two
In “Atlanta: Robbin’ Season,” no one is safe. Earn (Donald Glover) continuously proves himself incapable both professionally and at home, learning that blood isn’t always thicker than water. Al (Brian Tyree Henry) reluctantly adopts and performs the rapper lifestyle that goes against his very nature, losing a part of himself in favor of a new Al more suited for the music industry. And Darius (Lakeith Stanfield)? Well, let’s just say he narrowly misses a fate we see all too often in headlines. Season Two of “Atlanta” isn’t as cohesive as the first, but its shining moments — Teddy Perkins, anyone? — make it even more worth the watch. —Mila Gauvin II
We recapped and reviewed the second season and thought it was occasionally brilliant but inconsistent. Read our episode-by-episode coverage here.
5. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” Season Five
Rumor has it that FOX’s cancellation of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” this May provoked such impassioned public outcry that NBC picked it up for another season. While the changing hands had more to do with contractual politics, the drama was a testament to how beloved this daffy workplace comedy has become. In its fifth season, it’s clear what flavor of wacky each character brings to the precinct’s dysfunctional family, making the thrills of their detective work (dangerous intrigue involving a mob boss) as uproariously entertaining as their office shenanigans, which include elaborate Halloween traditions, wildly unprofessional police interrogations, and a ridiculous food truck venture. —Claire N. Park
4. “Queer Eye” Seasons One and Two
When this classic Bravo series was rebooted as a Netflix exclusive earlier this year, it was a godsend for many. In the political turmoil of 2018, the Fab Five — Antoni Porowski, Tan France, Karamo Brown, Bobby Berk, and Jonathan Van Ness — arrived to help the men of America clean their act up. On a quest not only to teach men about style, grooming, and clean eating, but also to solve deeper emotional hang-ups, the stars of the show charm everyone they meet, not least of all the audience. —Ethan B. Reichsman
We reviewed the first season and called it a “universal call for anyone just wanting to feel love.” Read more here.
3. “Insecure,” Season Three
It doesn’t feel like much happens in “Insecure” Season Three, but maybe that’s the point. After Issa (Issa Rae) quits her job, she embarks on several journeys, both romantic and professional, that aren’t what she’d hoped they’d be. The show paints her failures as quasi-successes — lessons she’s meant to learn from — but as we come to know in “Insecure,” learning from one’s mistakes is easier said than done. Right, Molly (Yvonne Orji)? This season doesn’t give us a lot to work with, but by the end, it looks like its characters are finally ready to work on themselves. —Mila Gauvin II
2. “BoJack Horseman,” Season Five
Season Five of “BoJack Horseman” sees its titular character in a new, self-aware spout of existentialism and insecurity. It’s as razor-sharp and dark as ever: BoJack (Will Arnett) confronts death during a 25-minute eulogy and becomes a feminist icon in the show’s daring artistic meditation on the #MeToo movement, all the while questioning what makes a good person “good” and a bad person “bad.” The show also takes its animation by the reins to wring out its creative potential, bridging the oft-discomforting gap between humans and animals who interact in ways more than platonic. —Kaylee S. Kim
We reviewed the fifth season and called it “poignant” and “satisfying. Read more here.
1. “The Good Place,” Season Two and Three
It makes sense that a show revolving around the afterlife and questions about whether humans can really change has itself gone through many transformations during its first three seasons. Starring Ted Danson and Kristen Bell, whose chemistry provides the foundation for the surprisingly high-minded show, “The Good Place” demonstrates clearly that a TV show can tackle immense philosophical questions while consistently providing some of the funniest content the small screen has to offer. Of course, with a sitcom legend like Michael Schur (“The Office,” “Parks and Recreation,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) running the show, “The Good Place” was destined for success. —Ethan B. Reichsman
We reviewed the season premiere and thought it was delightful and bold. Read more here.

10. “Heads of the Colored People” by Nafissa Thompson-Spires
As she makes clear in her debut collection of short stories, Nafissa Thompson-Spires does not care to write herself into labels or categorization. The stories in “Heads of the Colored People” are satirical and devastatingly relevant, engaging and vulnerable, broadening the often erased but infinite spectrum of blackness. From a black professor at a small college to the only black girl in a yoga class, Thompson-Spires depicts not just how lonely it is fighting a stereotype, but also how much lonelier it is being an anti-stereotype. —Mila Gauvin II
9. “Well-Read Black Girl” by Glory Edim
Have you ever connected with a fictional character on every level? For black women, these characters are few and far between. “Well-Read Black Girl” works to combat that perceived absence by bringing to the fore black women writers and the stories that gave them characters who look like and inspire them. Glory Edim makes her online book club for black girls tangible in this essay collection, featuring writers Jesmyn Ward, Tayari Jones, and Gabourey Sibide. From their inspiration — ranging from Toni Morrison to mythology — emerges an anthology that will rouse the next generation of young black girls. —Mila Gauvin II
8. “All You Can Ever Know” by Nicole Chung
“All You Can Ever Know” is Nicole Chung’s memoir and first book. Chung, who is Catapult Magazine’s editor-in-chief and has previously served as managing editor of The Toast, was born to Korean parents and adopted by white parents a few months later. Chung narrates the story alternately between her point of view and that of her biological sister, Cindy, with whom she reunites later in life. The Washington Post named the novel one of the “Best Books of Fall” and TIME named it a “Best Nonfiction Book of the Year.” —Lucy Wang
We reviewed “All You Can Ever Know” earlier this year. Find out what we thought here.
7. “Killing Commendatore” by Haruki Murakami
Haruki Murakami, who’s been name-dropped by The New Yorker as a potential Nobel candidate, has been churning out books since 1979. Nearly 40 years later, his newest book, “Killing Commendatore,” traces familiar ground for a Murakami fan: It follows an unnamed narrator on the run through the forests of Japan, trying to escape both the spirit world and his own complicated emotions. The novel includes a famous artist, a Nazi assassination attempt, and the physical manifestation of an Idea. Many reviewers have dubbed it a fitting homage to “The Great Gatsby” — although others have suggested that “Killing Commendatore” does not live up to Murakami’s best work. —Iris M. Lewis
We had mixed feelings about “Killing Commendatore,” giving it 3.5 stars. Find out why here.
6. “Useful Phrases for Immigrants” by May-Lee Chai
Winner of the Bakwin Award, May-Lee Chai’s 166-page short story collection, “Useful Phrases for Immigrants,” stunned readers by packing a serious amount of weight into a very small book. (The New York Times called it “capacious.”) In the very first page, what starts off as a polite standoff between Guilin and a store clerk quickly spirals into tangents fraught with class and assimilation, a testament to Chai’s elegant — and efficient — world- and character-building abilities. Chai’s eight stories are both private and global, zeroing in on individual family histories while traversing the continents of the Chinese diaspora. —Grace Z. Li
5. “Convenience Store Woman” by Sayaka Murata
If Keiko Furukura could work in a convenience store her whole life, she would. But that’s not what the world around her wants, as her friends, family, and co-workers make increasingly frustrating judgments about Keiko’s age, single status, and never-ending relationship with her job. Author Sayaka Murata asks us if the things long considered to be normal — society’s obsession with conformity and gendered values — really are so in this marvelously bizarre and always charming novella. “Convenience Store Woman” is a love story of an unlikely match between our fearless narrator and a 24-hour, perpetually lit convenience store. —Grace Z. Li
We reviewed “Convenience Store Woman” and gave it 4 stars. Read why here.
4. “Fruit of the Drunken Tree” by Ingrid Rojas Contreras
Colombian author Ingrid Rojas Contreras debuted her first novel, “Fruit of the Drunken Tree,” to great critical acclaim this year, making the New York Times editor’s choice list. The story, which Contreras said was partially inspired by her own upbringing has, follows the parallel stories of seven-year-old Chula, her older sister Cassandra, and their live-in housemaid Petrona, during the height of drug lord Pablo Escobar’s power. Chula and Cassandra only hear of stories of the violence happening just beyond their gate, a sharp contrast to Petrona’s mysterious guerilla background. —Lucy Wang
3. “Feel Free” by Zadie Smith
Critically acclaimed British author Zadie Smith’s latest work, “Feel Free,” is a collection of essays that explore topics ranging from Jay-Z to “Get Out” to Brexit. Smith has a strong grasp on both politics and popular culture, which she deconstructs expertly with her keen eye and lucid writing style. Balanced between Smith’s own personal experiences and her thoughts on the world, this collection is chock full of Smith’s nuanced and brilliant insights. —Caroline E. Tew
We gave “Feel Free” 4 stars. Read about it here.
2. “The Third Hotel” by Laura van den Berg
Laura van den Berg, a Briggs-Copeland Lecturer for Harvard’s Creative Writing Program, impressed critics with her latest novel “The Third Hotel.” In a witty and surreal manner, van den Berg describes the exploits of Clare, a newly widowed woman who keeps seeing her late husband on a trip to a film festival in Havana, Cuba. This novel is a thoughtful meditation on marriage, grief, and horror films that blurs the lines between reality and fantasy, the mundane and the extraordinary. —Caroline E. Tew
1. “There There” by Tommy Orange
“There There” takes its title from Gertrude Stein, who, as one of the book’s characters discovers, “found that she was talking about how the place where she’d grown up in Oakland had changed so much, that so much development had happened there, that the there of her childhood, the there there, was gone, there was no there there anymore.” Situating his debut novel in Oakland, California, Cheyenne and Arapaho author Tommy Orange writes of the relationship between Native Americans and the city through a cast of interwoven perspectives, all the while rooting their experiences in the history that began long before settlers arrived and took over their continent. —Kaylee S. Kim
We reviewed “There There” and gave it 5 stars. Read more here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Love what you do and do what you love.” This age-old phrase was preached by Ray D. Bradbury and now continues to be used, overused, and reversed. It has even been turned into an acronym — DWYL. But what exactly does it mean for us to do something and love it? Or to choose to do something for the rest of our lives because we love it?
After being fortunate enough to spend some time interning this past summer, I was able to gain insight into what adulthood is truly like. Luckily, most of my mentors were happily enveloped in what they were doing. So, seeing them take on task after task with enthusiasm was cause for hope. But when the questions turned over to me and my future plans, I reflexively responded with “I want to do what I love and love what I do.” Though this phrase was followed by synchronized head nods and uh-huhs, after thinking about what I had just said, the phrase seemed to only leave me more confused.
Everyone wants to spend their waking hours doing things they enjoy. No one goes out into the world wanting to work for something or someone they despise and actively choose to do things they hate. Yet, most people genuinely hate what they do and visibly and audibly complain about it. (I see you working on those problem sets, Econ concentrators shooting for Goldman Sachs.)
Thus, if everyone acknowledges the meaning of the DWYL phrase, why do people still commit to things they hate? Does the phrase not carry the weight that it once did?
Not necessarily. With looming financial and future obligations, it becomes ever more difficult to do what one loves as one gets older. Everybody loves and values things differently. However, a common characteristic among people who do not “do what they love” is that they love something else more. Their ultimate choice of occupation took a sacrifice.
In my view, we are essentially all doing what we love, just not in the typical way everyone thinks. For example, the custodian of your first-year dorm — more likely than not — would prefer to not clean up your vomit from the night before. Yet, there they are the next morning, at 9 a.m., mopping the bathroom floor and genuinely wishing you a good morning as you grudgingly walk to the morning class you thought you could handle but are now severely regretting.
As a twenty year-old, that custodian mopping up your vomit may have used the same DWYL phrase to describe their future. But at the time, doing what they loved most likely did not involve a mop and some disinfectant. And, this does not apply only to the lower paying ends of the spectrum. A doctor, lawyer, broker, or politician may not always love what they do. In actuality, many individuals in those fields warn against joining their field. They would suggest you avoid the troubles associated with the job entirely and tell you to choose something “better.”
So, how will we ever make the right choice? How will we ever know what loving what one does really means? And how will we choose a career and a life in which we are doing what we love?
After pondering the question for myself and then asking family and friends, the answer is simple: Doing what you love does not have to mean doing what we think we should love or what other people think we would love. It can often mean doing something that benefits those we love, including ourselves.
That custodian mopping the floors at 9 a.m. has a two year-old daughter at home who he gets to see every night after his shift. When he comes home, he can spend quality time with her and treat her to nutritious formula that he is able to pay for with his custodian paycheck.
The doctor, the hotel receptionist, the graphic designer, the mechanical engineer, the mail carrier, and the hundreds of unique jobs that an individual can have all have the potential to be worthwhile if they sustain a higher meaning for themselves. Doing what one loves, then, means doing what one values, whether that is in direct relation to one’s job or a result of it.
Thus, as finals approach and as the stress starts to fume out of students’ ears, it is important that we remind ourselves that we are not defined by what we assume our dream position or dream life will be. It is important to live in the moment and realize that what we are doing now is our dream. We are at Harvard, we are learning incredible things, and we are blessed with opportunities others do not have. Just breathe and everything else will fall into place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My curiosity got the better of me a month ago, and I emailed a request to the Harvard FAS Registrar’s Office to view my admissions file. I figured that with only one semester left in my college career here, I’d be distant enough from my application process and freshman “community conversations” about imposter syndrome to handle any brutally honest comments about my application from the admission department. Of course, the continuing saga of the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit against Harvard also only piqued my curiosity.
To be perfectly honest, I did not necessarily enter the viewing room last week with the best of intentions. I was searching for a scrap of evidence that my race or status as a recruited athlete overshadowed the rest of my application, with which I could write a scathing column. Ultimately, I was underwhelmed by the assessment in my file. But what was I expecting? A handwritten comment in the margins of my Common Application standardized test score section saying, “scores not quite high enough for an Asian, but good enough for an athlete”?
I chide myself now for my ill-conceived expectations. Even though the admissions trial has shed a bright light on the mysterious 1 to 6 ranking system and evaluation process, there were still several markings I could not identify the meaning of. The only substantive assessments accessible were comments from my alumni and on-campus interviews. These certainly carried no explicit acknowledgement of the racial tinge that both sides of the trial seem to imagine heavily color every application, but unsurprisingly my interviewers acknowledged that I was being actively recruited by the rugby coach.
I was left wondering if perhaps the whole trial affair isn’t just a lot of sound and fury. Admittedly, my mixed Asian-white ethnic and racial background hasn’t had the same influence on my lived experiences that it’s had for some of my peers. I shouldn’t be surprised that it didn’t figure very strongly in my application. But I also know, thanks to some surprisingly excellent Crimson reporting, that there was still more to my admissions process than what I could see in that slim folder. I’ll never be privy to those closed-door committee discussions or votes where more unpacking of status and qualifications take place.
Perhaps the most valuable part of this experience was a reminder that my admissions readers and evaluators have initials and names, and live real lives. As I read their comments, I didn’t feel like the abstraction of “Harvard” in all its overwhelming weight and legacy was scrutinizing me with a magnifying glass in an austere admissions court. Rather, real people with names were basically filling out a form, a strangely comforting sense of personal bureaucracy that felt very different from the admissions trial’s rhetoric.
Don’t get me wrong: I still don’t believe for a second that the admissions process doesn’t somehow move the goalposts for applicants based on various labels and statuses. If anything, this trial has revealed what we already all knew to be true — that college admissions is nothing but a crapshoot for most people. But I believe it is possible for us to think too much of central figureheads, to improperly personify an institution or idea into something it is not.
What do I mean by this? Well, when we speak in such generalized nothingburgers such as “Harvard is committed to diversity” or “Harvard under-resources this-or-that interest group,” we seem to envision some omnipotent master “Harvard”-planner pushing buttons and pulling levers to nefariously alter the balance of power and resources on this campus. If our demands and agenda are heard, we have found favor with the all-powerful brain; if they aren’t, the powers that be are clearly conspiring against us.
The reality is surely much more mundane. I often joke to my friends at dinner (usually followed by groans) that mid-level bureaucrats are the ones who really run the world. It’s not as if University President Lawrence S. Bacow or Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana are personally reading applications or approving funding for student groups. The middling Office of Student Life administrators, a cohort of very normal admissions officers, the likes of DMV clerks and the IRS, and other oft-faceless rubber-stamp bureaucrats who are just trying to do their jobs and stay in their administrative lanes — these are the ones who have a much more measurable impact on our lives.
I struggle to believe that most large institutions like Harvard, with its countless demands of routine administrative machinery, can actually enact something like the master scheme to reward or punish chosen groups we seem to imagine it has. If anything, viewing my admissions file was a reassuring yet somewhat haunting reminder of the human nature of institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University recently acknowledged that 291 part-time workers surpassed their 17.5 hour weekly cap last year, or were “cycled” between working as “temps,” or temporary workers, and “LHTs,” or less-than-half-time workers, to avoid exceeding their 90 day limits. The University may have sought to take advantage of this loophole to cut costs. We believe its actions were unethical, and that it should compensate its employees for the extra hours they worked.
From a purely fiscal standpoint, the case for cycling workers from temp to LHT status and back is clear. Doing so allows the University to avoid providing workers with full-time employment benefits. From a legal perspective, the practice does not run afoul of any laws. However, this does not mean it is ethical for Harvard to engage in these practices. Many of these workers deal with economic uncertainty and put in many hours hoping to secure elusive full-time positions after working as temps or LHTs. It is therefore only fair that Harvard remunerate employees for all the extra hours they worked, given the expectation of stable long-term employment that lured many to work part-time in the first place.
Fortunately, the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers came together to forge a new agreement that was put up for a vote yesterday. A joint union-Harvard committee will ensure that the agreement is enforced properly. Additionally, the University must release data detailing the hours that LHTs and temps work, as well as the duration of their employment. The new guidelines appear to be a significant improvement for part-time workers, as they promise to break the process of cycling and lengthy workweeks that have exploited workers for far too long.
Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the union and Harvard have not explicitly incorporated the voices of those affected by this policy in the negotiation process. Temp workers and LHTs are not members of HUCTW. However, their opinions should certainly matter in deciding the labor practices that they will work under. We believe that moving forward, both parties should solicit these workers’ thoughts.
We expect the HUCTW poll to have been a free and fair election, leading to a decision that will make the lives of hundreds of workers easier and more prosperous — whether they choose to accept the agreement or return to the bargaining table and fight for a new contract.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chapter of sorority Alpha Phi — which shuttered in response to the College’s social group sanctions in August — is back in business.
The group’s Iota Tau Cambridge chapter returned to campus in November. On Monday, it joined Alpha Phi’s national parent group and the Delta Gamma Fraternity Management Corporation as plaintiffs in a lawsuit alleging Harvard’s social life policy violates Massachusetts state law.
Alpha Phi is now the only all-female social organization at Harvard, ending a monthslong period during which Cambridge boasted zero women’s-only social groups.
Over the past year, every single one of Harvard’s all-female groups chose to go co-ed, thus earning College recognition and exemption from the sanctions. The penalties — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity team athletic captaincies, and from receiving Harvard endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The Cambridge Alpha Phi chapter was the last Harvard-based sorority to shift policies in response to the sanctions. The group was forced to disaffiliate from its national organization, Alpha Phi International.
Alpha Phi International wrote in an August press release agreeing to honor the Cambridge chapter’s dissolution that the group chose to go co-ed “in direct response” to the sanctions.
The Harvard chapter reversed tracks and petitioned the national organization to reissue its charter on Nov. 9, according to its lawsuit against the University. The suit states Alpha Phi decided to reopen because it recognized the sanctions constitute the “unjust destruction of women’s spaces and women’s rights.”
Alpha Phi International granted the request on Nov. 19.
Even though Harvard Alpha Phi has now reopened its doors, the group is not what it once was, according to the suit.
“Eleven former members, including approximately five who are current sophomores, have rejoined or expressed interest in rejoining,” the suit states. “Now reopened, the chapter is but a shadow of the dynamic organization that once existed, because the Sanctions Policy has deterred Harvard women from joining or rejoining Iota Tau.”
The lawsuit ties the decline in student interest in Alpha Phi directly to the sanctions. The sorority “peaked at 160 members in 2017, but membership fell sharply after Harvard announced and began to implement its Sanctions Policy,” according to the suit.
The lawsuit also notes that — in an apparent violation of the College’s social group policy — “some current sophomore members and alumnae in the group hold leadership positions in campus groups at this time.”
Alpha Phi and Harvard could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.
After severing ties with Alpha Phi International in August, several former members of the sorority formed a new, co-ed group called The Ivy.
That group will continue to exist on campus separately from the newly reopened Alpha Phi chapter, according to messages sent in an internal Alpha Phi chat and obtained by The Crimson. Members of The Ivy will not be subject to the sanctions because the College granted the group recognition after it adopted a gender-neutral membership policy.
Lawyers argued in public filings that Alpha Phi returned to campus in order to make a public show of defiance against the sanctions. In the chat, group members also wrote it was important to reopen the Cambridge chapter to support Alpha Phi International’s lawsuit.
Alpha Phi president Amelia M. Apgar ’20 wrote in a message to former sorority members that the chapter “decided it was important to establish a presence on the campus due to the international lawsuit,” alluding to the fact that Alpha Phi is an organization with chapters in both the U.S. and Canada.
She wrote in another message that the new Alpha Phi chapter planned to go “underground to keep sophomores as safe as possible, however they deem most appropriate.”
Alpha Phi had previously announced its return to Cambridge in a public Instagram post.
In addition to the Massachusetts state suit filed Monday by Alpha Phi and two other Greek groups, a set of fraternities, sororities, and anonymous Harvard students filed a separate federal complaint the same day alleging the sanctions violate Title IX and constitute sex discrimination.

Physics and Astronomy Professor Christopher W. Stubbs has been appointed dean of science for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, according to an email sent by FAS Dean Claudine Gay to the faculty body last Thursday.
Stubbs served as interim dean of science since June, after Geophysics Professor Jeremy Bloxham stepped down from the position at the end of the 2017-2018 academic year. From 2007 to 2010, Stubbs chaired the Physics Department.
Stubbs said he has several new initiatives in mind. First up on his agenda: overseeing the recently established Quantitative Biology Initiative — which seeks to create predictive mathematical models for living systems — and the Quantum Science Initiative, which brings together physicists and engineers to collaborate in areas such as quantum computing.
“We have some interesting intellectual initiatives that my predecessors got underway that we need to get fully implemented,” Stubbs said. “Undertaking those in partnership with the Engineering School and making sure that those new scholarly enterprises flourish: that’s another objective.”
In terms of the new ideas he will bring to the deanship, Stubbs said he aims to expand Harvard’s course offerings in the Sciences, given the new General Education program next year. Science concentrators will now have to meet a Science, Technology, and Society requirement that cannot double-count with their concentration, so Stubbs said he wants students to have as many interesting options as possible.
“Things that distinguish a little bit the approach that I’ve taken from that of my predecessor is I’m deciding to try to play a strong role in curricular issues,” he said. “I’ve been talking a lot with department chairs and colleagues about offering a slate of courses that we think will be interesting and attractive to Harvard students and addressing some of the course volume requirements that we have.”
Stubbs also cited the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ upcoming move to the Allston campus — slated to open in Fall 2020 — as an opportunity to rethink the geographic layout of the Sciences departments.
“Coordinating that with what we do in Allston gives us an opportunity to do some long-range, strategic thinking about configuring the spaces that we have to achieve intellectual adjacencies, to revise our instructional spaces, to maybe move a little bit more in the direction of hands-on learning,” Stubbs said.
Finally, Stubbs emphasized his commitments to supporting postdoctoral students as they prepare to apply for faculty positions, as well as improving communication between faculty members and staff.
“We absolutely need to establish a mutually respectful and inclusive workplace,” Stubbs said. “We need to have faculty fully appreciate how essential the staff are in our running an effective organization and helping us achieve our educational and scholarly goals as a University.”
In addition to these new efforts, Stubbs said he wants to continue the progress made by his predecessor in promoting gender parity in the sciences. He praised Bloxham and former FAS Dean Michael D. Smith for raising the percentage of female tenure-track faculty in the department to 50 percent.
“Given the gender representation challenges we face in these fields, I think that’s a tremendous accomplishment,” Stubbs said. “Our office is as committed to inclusive diversity as was the case with our predecessor. I certainly hope we can continue in that vein.”
Astronomy Department Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb praised Stubbs as a “brilliant researcher” in an email. In particular, Loeb pointed to Stubbs’s contributions to the identification and characterization of dark matter and dark energy — two primary constituents of the universe that are still not well understood — pioneering work that expanded the frontiers of existing knowledge at the interface between physics and astronomy.
Regarding Stubbs’s tenure as interim dean of science, Loeb said his leadership style during that time was “focused on substance” and highly “efficient.”
“He is kind and generous in interactions with students and colleagues, and transparent and straightforward in his public deliberations,” Loeb wrote.
Loeb wrote that Stubbs has worked to promote consensus during group discussions and often ended meetings with a list of action items to achieve agreed-upon goals.
“There is no doubt in everyone's mind that scientific research and education at FAS will blossom under Dean Stubbs’s leadership for years to come,” Loeb wrote. “We are all excited to work with Dean Stubbs in promoting science at Harvard and beyond.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge police are investigating a “possible hate crime” after witnesses say a man intentionally toppled over a large menorah placed on Cambridge Common by student group Harvard Chabad.
Two witnesses reported Sunday that around 3:30 p.m., a white male dressed in all black approached the menorah riding a black bicycle, Cambridge police spokesperson Jeremy Warwick said Monday night. The man then dismounted his bicycle, walked over to the menorah, and pushed it to the ground.
Several bystanders stood the menorah back up shortly thereafter and then an older man led the group in a Hanukkah prayer, Universal Hub first reported.
Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, the founder and director of Chabad, said the organization has placed large menorahs on Cambridge Common and in other locations across the city for the past 19 years. Though the menorahs have been vandalized in the past, this is the first time it has happened “in broad daylight,” Zarchi said.
“It was really, you know, hateful,” Zarchi said. “He didn't really care the fact that he was being observed and that there would be witnesses to it.”
“I wish I could say we’re shocked,” he added.
Last year saw a nearly 60 percent increase in the number of anti-Semitic incidents reported in the United States — the largest single-year increase on record, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In October, 11 people died and six were wounded in a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Penn., the deadliest-ever attack perpetrated against Jews on American soil. And last week, a Columbia psychology professor’s office walls were vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti.
The New England branch of the Anti-Defamation League tweeted about the incident on Cambridge Common Monday afternoon, calling it “unacceptable.”
“Religious freedom means all faiths have to right to pray & celebrate without fear or intimidation,” the tweet reads.
The Criminal Investigations unit of the Cambridge Police Department had not yet identified a suspect as of Monday evening, Warwick said.
Incoming Harvard Hillel president Rebecca Thau ’20 said the executive director of Hillel, Rabbi Jonah Steinberg, has been in “constant communication” with the Harvard University Police Department since the Tree of Life shooting. HUPD has since routinely stationed a car outside of Hillel.
Outgoing Hillel President Corey A. Gold ’19 said that though the incident left some students “very unsettled,” he believes most Jewish students feel safe at the University.
“I think that HUPD and the Cambridge police are taking perceived threats and real threats very seriously, especially during this especially sensitive time for the Jewish community,” he said.
Ultimately, Zarchi said he hopes people focus on the effort passersby made to restore the menorah — an action he called “a little modern-day Hanukkah miracle.”
“You see these wonderful people — wonderful people who we don't know and could be some even not of the Jewish faith — who were disturbed by what they witnessed and immediately sprung into action to restore it and to bring the menorah to its full glory,” Zarchi said.
Chabad student presidents Gabriela J. Siegal ’20, Anne A. Rosenblatt ’20, and Hannah K. Harris ’20 wrote in an email that they “condemn this act of vandalism,” but nevertheless will continue with their Hanukkah celebrations.
“We appreciate the efforts of the Cambridge community members who took the time to restore our menorah,” they wrote. “Despite the rise of anti-Semitism, tomorrow at 5pm, we will gather as a community on the steps of Widener library to light the Hanukkah candles with President Bacow.”

Michael Liu ’19, Olga Romanova ’19, and T. Mattea Mrkusic ’17 have been named Harvard’s three newest international Rhodes scholars, bringing the total number of University-affiliated winners this year to five.
This year, the Rhodes Trust launched two new Global Rhodes Scholarships for candidates from anywhere in the world. Romanova is among the inaugural winners of the Global Rhodes. Liu, who is a Canadian native, and Mrkusic, who is from New Zealand, won scholarships from their home regions.
Two other Harvard seniors, Brittany N. Ellis ’19, a Crimson news executive, and Jin K. Park ’18–’19, also won Rhodes scholarships this year in the American districts. Park is the first DACA recipient to become a Rhodes scholar in United States history. The Rhodes Scholarship pays for graduate study at Oxford University, and more than 350 Harvard alums have received the honor since the scholarship’s establishment in 1902.
Romanova, who identifies as Russian but was born and raised in Japan, only became eligible to apply for the prestigious scholarship this year.
“I was in a very different situation because I didn’t think that I would ever have the opportunity to become a Rhodes Scholar until last June, when I found out about this,” Romanova said. “So I guess the experience wasn’t something that I actively thought about.”
“I’m really grateful to the Rhodes Trust for actually thinking about opening this up to many more people from countries who were not previously represented by the Rhodes constituencies,” she added.
Romanava, a Bioengineering concentrator who is also pursuing a secondary field in Global Health and Health Policy, said that she is excited to studying the intersection of both fields at Oxford.
“I’m really interested in understanding how technology innovation, research in the sciences, actually gets translated into tangible or practical policies that can leave an impact on society,” Romanova said.
Outside of the classroom, Romanova leads an a cappella group, The Harvard LowKeys, and has competed in synchronized skating on national and international levels.
Liu, a Human Development and Regenerative Biology concentrator, said he is “still kind of processing” the news. Liu, along with the other international Rhodes scholars, received notice of his win a week after the American Rhodes scholars were announced.
He said in an interview Sunday that he was driving home from a movie with his friends during Thanksgiving break when he got the call.
“I was at a loss for words initially, and I think afterwards, I was just really grateful for all the support that I've had throughout the years at Harvard and beyond,” Liu said. “It really takes a village and so I'm just super grateful."
Liu will be studying public policy, global health, and epidemiology at Oxford. He said his experience working as one of the directors of the Cambridge youth homeless shelter Y2Y led him to see how “incredibly interdisciplinary” health challenges can be.
“Essentially what I'm interested in doing is taking a very interdisciplinary approach to looking at what are the contributors to early health inequities for these populations and how can we tackle them from many different perspectives,” Liu said.
He said he hopes to work in pediatrics in community and homeless clinics after his Rhodes scholarship.
Mrkusic graduated from Harvard in 2017 and has since worked on a documentary about the criminal justice system, conducted climate change migration research, and worked as a freelance journalist.
At Harvard, she completed a special concentration in Environmental Studies and Human Rights. She said she intends to continue that trajectory at Oxford through a masters of public policy and a masters in forced migration and refugee studies.
“I've always been deeply interested in environmental justice, human rights, and storytelling,” Mrkusic wrote in an email Monday. “I've followed my nose to chase those issues, and have had tremendously supportive mentors to guide me along the way. The Rhodes was certainly a surprising result.”
Liu said, despite winning a Rhodes, “not much has changed,” but he said he is ready for his future at Oxford.
“I'm still a little consumed by finals, I'm still very behind, but it's still really humbling and I think in many ways, it's exciting,” Liu said. “I feel like what it means is that I have two years to really think hard about problems that I'm interested in tackling.”

Forty-eight seniors began their Monday with some exciting news: they had been elected to the College’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a national academic honor society. They join 24 juniors elected last spring.
“I woke up to the news this morning and was over the moon excited — receiving a nomination was an honor in itself,” Anant T. Pai ’19 wrote in an email. “I never imagined I would actually be elected.”
Harvard’s Alpha Iota chapter typically selects students who have “chosen the most challenging courses available, pursued independent research as part of an honors concentration, achieved excellence in coursework across all academic divisions, and attained outstanding grades in all courses,” according to the College’s Handbook for Students.
About 44 percent of the class of 2019’s newest inductees concentrate in the division of Science, a change from last year, when Social Sciences made up the largest portion with 42 percent of the class.
Those studying within the Social Sciences constitute roughly 35 percent of the 48 seniors this year, while the Arts and Humanities and the School of Engineering and Applied Science represent 13 and 8 percent, respectively.
The concentration with the highest representation among inductees was Economics, with six students receiving the honor. A total of 22 different concentrations made up the “Senior 48.”
Many students were excited and thankful upon hearing of their induction.
Rana C. Bansal ’19 wrote in an email that felt humbled when he received the email informing him of his selection.
“I've picked my classes though my interests in economics, government, and statistics and try to balance quantitative and qualitative coursework each semester in order to make the most of what Harvard has to offer,” Bansal wrote.
Many of the honorees said they explored interests beyond their concentrations during college, enrolling in classes in many academic departments.
Sarah Horne ’19 wrote in an email that she took courses in seven different academic disciplines her freshman year.
“Interdisciplinary learning is incredibly enriching, and I have found that I learn the most when I am studying the same issues from many different academic perspectives,” she wrote.
Daniela Muhleisen ’19, a Government concentrator, wrote in an email that she also appreciated the opportunity to engage in an interdisciplinary education.
“I love learning about Latin American history and violence prevention and public health policy, but I also love writing poetry and fiction,” Muhleisen wrote. “I have been able to pursue all these passions here. It’s really just a blessing.”
Yanet C. Gomez ’19, a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator, wrote in an email that she coupled her biology studies with social anthropology classes to prepare her for a career as a physician, and that she was “extremely grateful” for the recognition.
“As a first generation student and immigrant, my time at Harvard has not been easy; I see this as a huge honor,” Gomez wrote.
Three additional students were also added to the 24 students who received Phi Beta Kappa honors as juniors last year — Evan MacKay ’19, Vaibhav Mohanty ’19, and David Stoner ’19, bringing the total number to 27. The three were not included in last semester’s announcement due to an error at the Registrar’s Office, according to Alpha Iota Secretary Logan McCarty, a lecturer in Physics.
The 48 fall electees will be officially inducted into the society during a ceremony on Dec. 10 at 7 p.m. in Leverett House’s Library Theater.

Embracing the motto “Stand Up to Harvard,” scores of fraternities and sororities nationwide declared their support for a pair of lawsuits filed Monday that seek to cancel the University’s controversial social group sanctions.
Representatives from at least 10 Greek organizations penned messages — both on Twitter and in emails to The Crimson — arguing Harvard’s social life policy is coercive and illegal. Fraternity and sorority members urged the courts to strike it down.
Numerous alumni of fraternities and sororities also posted on Twitter in support of the suits, linking to a website the plaintiffs created to bolster their case.
“On December 3, brave students, sororities and fraternities filed lawsuits in federal and Massachusetts courts to stand up for the rights of students,” read a tweet many alumni re-posted verbatim across the social media site. “It is time to stand up to Harvard.”
Harvard’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity team athletic captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
Harvard’s penalties have drawn vehement opposition from some students, faculty, and alumni alike since their debut in May 2016. Now, two lawsuits filed by students, sororities, and fraternities allege the policy constitutes sex-based discrimination and denies undergraduates freedom of association.
A complaint filed in federal court by Greek organizations and three anonymous Harvard undergraduates asserts the sanctions are discriminatory based on sex and violate Title IX and the United States Constitution. A suit brought in Massachusetts court by two sororities alleges the social group penalties violate the Massachusetts Constitution and the state’s Civil Rights Act by denying undergraduates equal treatment based on their sex.
Representatives from national fraternities and sororities Alpha Omicron Pi, Delta Upsilon, and Alpha Xi Delta wrote in emailed statements that they support the plaintiffs in both cases.
“Delta Upsilon International Fraternity strongly supports the action taken to challenge Harvard’s sanction policy that punishes students who join off-campus, single-sex social organizations,” Delta Upsilon Director of Communications Ashley Martin Schowengert wrote.
The plaintiffs in both cases defended their anti-sanctions arguments and denounced Harvard’s policy at a press conference held Monday in Harvard Square.
At the event, former Delta Gamma president Rebecca J. Ramos ’17 said the sanctions have crippled the sorority in the year since she graduated. Pointing to an anti-penalties protest attended by hundreds of women in the days following former University President Drew G. Faust’s 2016 announcement of the policy, she argued the policy has spurred backlash from some students for years.
“Harvard attempted to tell the female students what would be good for them without bothering to ask them,” Ramos said.
Lawyers overseeing both suits argued the policies are not only controversial, they are unconstitutional.
Zalkind, Duncan, and Bernstein partner Emma Quinn-Judge, the lead lawyer for the state case, said at the press conference that Harvard’s sanctions bar women from “opportunities” that men at the College can enjoy. She said the policy violates anti-sex discrimination provisions in the Massachusetts Constitution and Civil Rights Act.
“These experiences and the opportunities that they provide go beyond students’ time at Harvard,” she said. “While they’re here, they provide them with networks, opportunities to learn from each other, to become leaders together, to share their views, to empower one another, to raise their voices together.”
R. Stanton Jones — a partner at Arnold & Porter, the well-connected D.C.-based law firm that has helped final clubs and Greek groups lobby Congress in the hope of canceling the sanctions — said at the press conference that the social organization penalties constitute “an unprecedented intrusion by Harvard into the private lives of its students and the choices they make about who to associate with off-campus.”
Harvard must file responses to both suits within the next several weeks, lawyers for the plaintiffs said Monday.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four seniors at the College were named winners of the 2019 Marshall Scholarship on Monday — marking the largest number of Harvard undergraduates selected as Marshall Scholars in the last five years.
Lyndon H. Hanrahan ’19, Justin C. Lee ’19, Manny A. Medrano ’19, and Vaibhav Mohanty ’19 are among the 48 U.S. undergraduate students selected for the prestigious scholarship, which covers the cost of a graduate-level education at an institution in the United Kingdom in any field of study. This year’s scholarship class is the largest in the program’s 65-year history, according to a press release.
Hanrahan, a Quincy resident, is pursuing a joint concentration in English and Visual and Environmental Sciences with a secondary in Theater, Dance, and Media. Hanrahan said he aspires to become a filmmaker.
“It was so surreal to find out. I didn’t think I was going to get it,” Hanrahan said. “I knew I was never going to be able to afford studying film post-grad, unless there was some sort of radical scholarship that allowed me to do so. I just sort of thought it was too wonderful an opportunity to pass up.”
Hanrahan said that during the in-person interview for the scholarship, he “tried to make a real plead for the arts as having a deserving and valid place within these post-graduate fellowships.” Hanrahan plans on using the scholarship to study at the graduate school at the Royal College of Art in London.
Lee, who is an Eliot resident concentrating in Economics with a secondary in Statistics, said he will use the scholarship to pursue a Master of Philosophy in Economic and Social History at the University of Oxford. Encouraged to apply by Harvard Economics Professor and former Marshall Scholar Benjamin M. Friedman, Lee said he found the scholarship appealing because of the opportunity it presented for studying economic philosophy in Britain.
“I knew I wanted to do graduate work in economics in particular, but in the United States, the econ programs are very mathematical, very empirically based, and that’s different from the more philosophical focus and historical focus of British universities,” Lee said.
On campus, Lee served as editor-in-chief of the Harvard Economics Review and currently captains the Harvard Triathlon Club. He said that he also looks forward to joining Oxford’s triathlon team next fall.
Medrano, who is a fellow Eliot resident, also shares Lee’s enthusiasm for studying abroad. Medrano is concentrating in applied math at the College with a secondary in archaeology, and he will be pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of St. Andrew’s in Scotland next fall.
Since 2016, Medrano has been researching khipus, which are Incan artifacts were used to encode numeral information, with the Harvard Anthropology Department. Deciphering this language has been, according to Medrano, “the perfect applied math problem.”
“To study in a different country is always special and especially because the field that I work in is global,” Medrano said. “I study another continent, so studying it from different viewpoints and from experts in different locations is really helpful to develop my own views on how to look at history and the past.”
Mohanty, a resident of Quincy House, concentrates in Chemistry and Physics with a secondary in Music. Next fall, he plans to study theoretical physics at the University of Oxford.
“I’m incredibly excited. I’m looking forward to the wonderful opportunities that I’m going to have in the U.K. and in Oxford,” Mohanty said. “I want to become a physician scientist, but I want to combine theoretical and computational methods from physics and apply them to biology.”
Mohanty praised the Marshall Scholarship’s mission of fostering international collaboration and interdisciplinary study.
“I think the Marshall has been looking for scholarly independence and an ability to collaborate with individuals across disciplines towards this common goal,” Mohanty said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WALTHAM, Mass. — The Harvard men's hockey team is hoping to unwrap a gift a few weeks early as it battles Bentley on Tuesday night searching for one last win before the four-week winter hiatus. The Crimson (4-4-2, 2-2-2 ECAC) is coming off a disappointing performance against then-No. 16 Cornell and remains at .500 after splitting last weekend.
The Falcons (5-9-1, 4-7-1 Atlantic Hockey) host Harvard for the first time ever. The home team faces a formidable Crimson attack that ranks in the top 10 in scoring nationwide boasts the country's top powerplay unit (38.6%). Junior defenseman Adam Fox (5–15—20), whose season-long point streak came to an end last Saturday against the Big Red, headlines the potent Harvard squad and paces the NCAA in points per game (2.00) and assists per game (1.50).
Also of note offensively, co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage (8–2—10) is tied for second in Division-I goals, and freshman winger Casey Dornbach (2–13—15) is second behind only Fox in assists per game (1.30). In short, Bentley will have its hands full against the Crimson, a team looking to bounce back from Saturday's loss and end the 2018 portion of its schedule on a high note.

WALTHAM, Mass. — The Harvard men’s hockey team can feel a little bit cheerier this holiday season after pocketing a win on Tuesday night against nearby foe Bentley. The Crimson (5-4-2, 2-3-2 ECAC) outlasted the Falcons (5-10-1, 4-7-1 Atlantic Hockey) in a physical tilt that marked the last of both teams’ pre-winter break schedules.
Six minutes into the third period, forward Jack Donato skated down the right side of the ice and into the offensive zone. With linemate Frédéric Grégoire driving the back post, the sophomore called his own number and ripped a shot over the glove of Bentley goaltender Aidan Pelino.
Donato’s snipe survived to be the game-winner, as Harvard skated to a 2-1 victory over the Falcons in its first-ever clash at Bentley Arena.
“In practice, we work a lot on transition offense: 3-on-2s, 2-on-1s,” Jack Donato said. “You don’t get them a lot in competitive games like this, so to bear down and get another one like that is pretty huge for our team. Obviously, we needed to get the win.”
The Crimson enters the four-week holiday break one game above .500 and feeling slightly better than it did after Saturday’s frustrating loss to then-No. 16 Cornell.
Crimson net-minder Michael Lackey posted another strong outing on Tuesday (1 GA, .960 SV%), building on several sturdy performances against Colgate and Cornell (twice). The senior has seen the puck effectively and exuded confidence between the pipes, and his numbers show it. Since Thanksgiving, Lackey is 3-1-0 on a 1.26 goals against average and a .955 save percentage.
“[Lackey] was awesome. I think he’s definitely hitting his stride, ever since MSG,” Jack Donato said. “I think that was a real turning point for our team. He’s been awesome, giving us chances to win, giving us confidence to take some chances offensively. And he’s been a rock for us.”
On Tuesday night, Lackey was able to limit Bentley to one goal, despite the home squad entering the matchup in the top half of Division I in goals per game (2.93) and in the top 20 nationally in powerplay percentage (20.8%).
The one score he did allow came courtesy of Falcons sophomore forward Brendan Hamblet, who put home an initial wrap-around feed from linemate Jonathan Desbiens. The 13:06 goal trimmed the Crimson lead to just one puck, making the remaining seven minutes interesting as Bentley tried to even the ledger. Lackey held his post, however, and sealed the victory.
“Michael has continued to get better and look more and more comfortable,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He’s had some big efforts as of late…. As a team, it’s really hard to win without having great nights from your goalie, and we certainly got one tonight.”
For the sixth time this season, Harvard opened the scoring. Early in the second frame, freshman forward Jack Drury punched a one-timer through the pads of Pelino for his fourth strike of the year.
Fellow rookie Casey Dornbach nabbed the assist on the goal, good for his 14th apple of the season. Dornbach (2–14—16) is tied for first in outright points among NCAA freshmen and paces his fellow first-years in assists, as well as per-game averages in both points and assists.
The winger’s hot start to the season earned him ECAC Rookie of the Month honors for November, and after his helper on Tuesday, he sits just a spot behind teammate Adam Fox for the highest assists-per-game average in college hockey (1.27).
After Tuesday’s tilt, first-years account for 37 percent of the Crimson’s total point production through 11 games, compared to just 24 percent through as many contests last season.
“Everyone’s optimistic about the group of guys that we have,” Lackey said. “We know the potential that we have. Although we might have not had games go our way early on in the season, I think everyone is excited for the second half of the season.”
Despite a relatively minor history between Harvard and Bentley — the teams have squared off just five times, with the Crimson having won each matchup — Tuesday’s contest took on a physical tone. Even prior to the first intermission, post-whistle exchanges were heated and chippy collisions were frequent. Both teams were skating in their third bout in five nights, so the physicality took its toll.
“This time of year, [the physicality] starts to take a toll on your body,” Jack Donato said. “We played Friday and Saturday, two pretty competitive games. We knew we needed these two points going forward. We wanted to build off it going into the break…. I thought we did just enough to win the game. We didn’t have our best, but good teams find ways to win, and that’s what we did.”
Also noteworthy in the mid-week showdown, Fox failed to register a point for just the second time this season, with the first occasion being this past Saturday. The junior (5–15—20) still ranks first among defensemen in points and tops college hockey in points per game (1.82) and assists per game (1.36).
Harvard returns to regular-season action in early January with a home tilt against RPI.

Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be medically quarantined at Harvard? Maybe you’ve heard horror stories, or maybe you’re heard how it’s the best thing that could ever happen to you. Lucky for you, this Flyby writer was in quarantine, so here’s some ~investigative~ (if you can call being held somewhere by force "investigative") reporting on all the deets of medical quarantine at Harvard:
The Room
HUHS put me in a DeWolfe room (flashback to my freshman dorm). It’s technically a double, though I am isolated in here, so there are two beds in the bedroom. The other room is a common room. It’s also pretty spacious — I’ve got two desks and two chairs, a fridge, and an oven, though the oven is pretty much useless. I think I’m also supposed to have a couch, but I walked in to find a cryptic note left on one of the desks:
“Hi! We borrowed your couch. Security said it was okay if we left this note.” - The room across the hall.
Considering the note was covered in dust, I doubt “borrow” was the right word, but okay, I guess. I still have two beds.
Rules
You can’t go to class. You can’t have visitors over. In fact, they close the door and don’t give you a key — meaning if you leave, you’re screwed. When you pick up stuff outside of your room, you have to wear a mask. For the days you’re in quarantine, you can’t even leave the room you’re in. (Don’t worry, they provide you a room with a bathroom.) You may be wondering — what about food?
Meals
All your food has to come from HUDS — you can’t order from anywhere else. This is honestly the worst part of quarantine. No Poke for five days is a living hell, yes, but at least you’re not infecting anybody. You have to order the next day’s meals by 7:30 p.m, and you can order anything from the grille or the HUDS menu. They bring it to your door and basically ding-dong ditch you. They knock, leave the food in a bag, and run away for fear of catching whatever it is you have. It’s kind of funny, to be honest.
Check-ins
Nurses call you twice a day to see how you’re doing. Word also spreads quickly, so you also get tons of calls from friends and family. But the most interesting call you’ll get is from the Cambridge Public Health Department, who will try to figure out where you got the disease and who you could potentially give it to.
Snacks
Honestly, Harvard hooks you up pretty well with snacks when you’re in quarantine. They gave me 9 packs of Goldfish, a whole box of granola bars, pudding, chicken soup, 5 bottles of water, and 10 bottles of red Gatorade. (Blue would’ve been too good to be true, but luckily I order blue powerade from HUDS every day.) You can also call Securitas, and they can make an effort to get anything else that you want. I’ve made it a habit to say that my snacks are "looking like a snack" today before eating them...has a lack of human contact already driven me crazy? You decide!
Materials
You can bring stuff from your dorm room before you head into quarantine. I brought more bottled water, all my schoolwork, my laptop, and my phone. They suggest you bring bedding and your work, but not to worry, they also provide you with things. Here’s a list of everything they gave me:
Shampoo
Soap
Towels
Mattress cover
Sheets
Blankets
Pillows
Medicine
Toilet Paper
Trash bags
Also I have two beds, so I made a megabed. Yep. I have a megabed.
So...is it really that bad? As I eat Goldfish in bed, am in limited pain because of a lot of Advil and Tylenol, and bingewatch Netflix, I really can’t complain.
