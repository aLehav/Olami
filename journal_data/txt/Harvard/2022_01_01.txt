After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Krokodiloes, the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, and the Radcliffe Pitches combined forces and returned to their home theater space of Sanders Theater in their show “Pitch Dark at Four O’Krok: A Veri-Cambridge Jam.” The concert took place on Sunday, Dec. 5 and spanned about two and a half hours.
The a capella jam began with the Radcliffe Pitches, who sang eleven songs in total. Throughout their performance, the Pitches maintained a composed and sophisticated demeanor in all-black outfits and organized in rows of two. The singers stood socially distanced from each other so that they could safely remove their masks and project to the audience as they sang. The song that really won the audience over was a rework of “Mr. Sandman,“ which included many lyrics familiar to Harvard students and the current Covid-19 regulations.
“Mr. Sandman, we made it through 1 weird semester now please make it two ,” was one relatable line. “Don't want to end up in virtual school,” and “can we stand closer the next time we sing,” were other funny changes to the iconic song. Finally, in a foreshadowing of what was to come, The Pitches were joined by the Harvard Krokodiloes, creating an even fuller sound and leaving the audience excited for the rest of the program.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, a co-ed a capella group, took the stage next in glamorous silver and black outfits. The group has 18 members, with over half being new additions. The Veritones were unlike any other a capella groups in this show, as member Chuck See ‘22’s skills as a vocal percussionist allowed them to perform more contemporary songs, such as “Genius” by LSD and “Leave the Door Open” by Silk Sonic. The Veritones also used the stage space extensively in their choreography, and made their performance more visually engaging by playing with levels in their formations by crouching down to the floor.
The Veritones also have a longstanding tradition of allowing all new members to arrange and be featured in a song. Because the group has a large number of newbies, they chose to divide up these members into 2 pieces: “Love on the Brain” by Rihanna and “La La Latch” by Pentatonix.
The Harvard Krokodiloes, Harvard’s oldest all-male a capella group, established in 1946, has twelve members. Their program consisted of 13 songs and one encore song. The group dressed formally in tuxedos and stood close together in a half circle, which required them to sing with masks on. The group began their section of the show with only Jongtae Jeon ‘22 and Joey Griffith ‘22 on stage, and eventually the other ten members joined them as the duo sang “The House of Blue Lights.”
Each group also had an alum-specific song that past members of each a capella group could stand up and join. The Radcliffe Pitches called for alums to stand up in their seats due to Covid-19 regulations and join them as they sang “Surprised” from the Pitches Songbook. The Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones followed the same format with their song, “Streets.” The Harvard Krokodiloes, however, vied for a more community-based approach, allowing alums to stand in front of the stage as they sang “Johnny O'Connor.” 11 alumni stood in front of the stage, joining in on the choreography of the piece that has been passed down for generations; moreover, some of them even wore the classic Krokodiloes tie with crocodile patterns along the front. Paying homage to their pasts as well as nodding to the future, the three groups truly produced a concert to remember.

Christmas arrived early in Seaport. Anyone walking down Seaport Drive in Boston will be immediately struck by three things: a giant Christmas tree, multiple curling lanes, and a massive holiday market. These are all part of “Snowport,” which runs from Nov. 19 to Jan. 2. Guests can shop, enjoy drinks such as apple cider and mulled wine at a number of vendors, and take pictures in front of the many Christmas trees.
The main attraction of Snowport is the holiday market. There are over 40 shops to choose from, which sell everything from ornaments and alpaca-fur clothes to cocktail mixers and puzzles. This year, Snowport worked hard to feature Black-owned, LGBTQ-owned, Latinx-owned, and Asian-owned businesses among the many vendors.
Following a long year of isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, business owners are eager to return to in-person events like Snowport to engage with the greater Boston community. Devon Holloway, for example, is the owner of the Black-owned business Hope Design and was emphatic about the importance of community engagement to the business. “A lot of our brand is based in community building,” he said, “so to come out to Seaport is great because we can meet new people, network with the vendors here, and we get to see so many different faces from different communities that come down to the Seaport.”
Bob Brown, owner of B and B Glass, further emphasized the importance of events such as Snowport for local businesses. “The pandemic was devastating to our sales because a lot of the events we participate in were canceled because they were considered too dangerous…,” he said. “We don’t sell online, so we need to be out where the public is.” Furthermore, he said these events are critical for finding customers.
Business owners are not the only ones who celebrate the return of community holiday events; Bostonians young and old are excited to return to festivities and enjoy the Christmas spirit. Boston resident Kaitlyn Walsh said, “I think after this year we’ve all suffered by not being out of the house, and small businesses have taken a hit too, so I think it’s nice that people are able to sell, and we’re able to buy and get together and celebrate the holidays.” Following a socially[-][ ]distanced Christmas in which many families were unable to reunite, Bostonians are ready to leave the house and enjoy winter in the city.
If one does not enjoy shopping, curling, or admiring Christmas trees, Snowport also features a biergarten serving hot cocktails and ciders. Other points of interest are a holiday toy drive and a chalkboard where people can write down their Christmas wishes.
Although Boston winters are cold and dreary, the Snowport holiday festival brings fun and good cheer, even to those on the naughty list. The festival's last day is Jan. 2, so be sure to check it out before the holiday season comes to a close.

In Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet,” Romeo is in Verona Beach — perhaps ensnared in a fiery gas station gunfight, playing billiards in a deteriorating warehouse, or speeding with the Capulet cousins in a silver 1976 Chrysler New Yorker Brougham convertible. Luhrmann, the famed Australian director whose work spans film, operas, and television, is known for his bold and inventive style, with works such as “Moulin Rouge!” and “The Great Gatsby.” 25 years ago, with Venice-beach style iconography and a soundtrack featuring Radiohead, Luhrmann ventured to create a timeless reinvention of Shakespeare’s classic tragedy. Although his unabashed and reckless style occasionally clouds the purity of the original play, Luhrmann’s work has stood the test of time as a blazing, brilliant and vibrant love story whose actors and scenery bring the script to life.
For a film that attempts to reframe the way we see "Romeo and Juliet," it certainly doesn’t rewrite a single word. In fact, except for a few small modifications to the original characters, Luhrmann stays completely true to Shakespeare's script. He switches a few characters between the Montague and Capulet families, and Lord and Lady Montague and Capulet are given first names, which they didn’t have in the original play.
However, the integrity of the dialogue is maintained, with Luhrmann retaining the style of late 16th century English against a modern setting. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, a charmingly innocent and devastatingly youthful Romeo and Juliet, give a masterful delivery of the language. They were both young and (relatively) inexperienced actors at the time, yet in an interesting way, their youth only strengthens the film. The story of Romeo and Juliet is a story of inexperienced, desperate, naive yearning. Danes’ quiet –– and at times unassured –– delivery hammers home the “teenage love” motif.
At times, the contrast of modernity with the film’s insistence on the original script is off-putting and even jarring. In the opening scenes, the shirtless and crude Montague boys feud with the slick Capulet gang in cowboy boots as “Pretty Piece of Flesh” by One Inch Punch blares in the background. When they open their mouths to speak and Shakespeare pours out, it almost feels forced. For a “reinvention” film adaptation, there isn’t really a way around this initial feeling –– a Shakespeare film cannot really be a Shakespeare film without Shakespeare's script.
Although Luhrmann doesn’t rewrite the words, he reinvents the characters who deliver them. Among the most memorable is his interpretation of Mercutio, played by Harold Perrineau. Mercutio’s introduction into the film is audacious, memorable, and loud, set to the horns blaring in “Young Hearts Run Free.” He blazes onto the scene –– an abandoned beachfront amusement park –– in a bright red convertible with a license plate to match: “MERCUTIO.” Laughing, almost screaming, he swipes his red lipstick before exiting the car in glittering heels, a silvery two-piece outfit, and a wig to match.
Perrineau’s Mercutio is one of the most prominent characters in the film, and especially today, even more so than in 1996, his importance cannot be understated. Shakespeare is here to stay. Nearly every student will interact with an aspect of his work in some way; however, Shakespeare can all too easily become a homogenous sea of white faces. This is why the relative diversity in Luhrmann’s adaptation is so notable. “Romeo and Juliet” is a common introductory Shakespeare work for middle and high school students, and teachers often show a movie in an attempt to make the script more accessible. Lurhmann’s “Romeo + Juliet” not only makes it more accessible through the modern setting and iconography, but through casting choices –– especially reimagining Mercutio’s character as a Black, queer man.
Of course, as Luhrmann does, there are points in the movie when he takes his reinvention a little too far. One scene that comes to mind is the first introduction to Lady Capulet, who arrives on screen screaming “JULIET!” over and over again as the camera cuts and shifts wildly to different shots of the Capulet mansion. This could be seen as engaging, but is actually more dizzying and overwhelming.
There are other moments, however, where Luhrmann’s imagination adds beauty and originality even beyond Shakespeare’s original words. The iconic fish tank scene, where Romeo and Juliet see each other for the first time, is wordless, yet perfectly encapsulates the young, endearing, “love-at-first-sight” theme for which the story is known and loved. In this way, Luhrmann brings Shakespeare to life even beyond his words, proving yet again that his adaptation is the perfect one for the modern day.
In another 25 years, Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” will undoubtedly still be read by millions of students across the world. It is likely that Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet” will follow suit as a timeless film that uses blazing guns, the shorelines of a mystical beachfront, and a young Leonardo DiCaprio to keep the story relevant in the present day.

Elizabeth B. Yntema has fond memories of walking to ballet class in Cambridge throughout her childhood and said ballet was “her home for a long time.” Even after she stopped taking classes, her years in the ballet world helped her develop a deep appreciation for the art. “Still, when I watch a good ballet performance, I’m weeping,” she said. “I know to bring a box of Kleenex.”
Around eight years ago, however, Yntema noticed something interesting at a performance in Chicago.
“I turn around and I look this way and that way, and the audience is 70% female… and I realize that with the big companies, I had not seen one work by a woman,” she said. “I started to dive deeper, looking at the set, costume, and lighting designers, and it was almost an entirely male team. When you see something like this, you cannot unsee it.”
This realization inspired Yntema to start the Dance Data Project, a 501(c)3 that combines dance and analytics to bring to light and fix the gender gap in ballet.
Yntema describes ballet as an “overwhelmingly female” business which “systematically excludes” these females from positions of power. Through the Dance Data Project, she hopes to provide resources to female-led organizations on topics such as financial planning and seeks to uplift diverse voices involved in the ballet world and shed light on continuing issues of sexual awareness and assault.
The Dance Data Project conducts surveys and other research with various artists, companies, and other organizations related to ballet, and shares this information to fuel gender discussions in ballet. They publish relevant statistics via their website and social platforms and also by connecting with larger media outlets and dance organizations.
Although many issues exist in almost all dance forms, Yntema focuses mainly on gender issues within the ballet industry. As ballet is one of the “most conservative” dance fields, she already knew of other groups that were focusing on other issues like race. Yntema also looked into other forms of dance, like contemporary or modern companies, and found that they were more equitable in budget sizes across companies — whereas the differences within ballet were more pronounced.
Girls, Yntema said, most often outnumber boys in ballet, where a 20:1 ratio is not uncommon in many classes. She suggests that these skewed demographics push ballet companies to offer more privileges to male participants, putting them on a “glass escalator” toward positions of higher authority within the group. In fact, the Dance Data Project found that out of the biggest ten dance companies in 2021, only one of them — Miami City Ballet — has a female artistic director.
“Schools will do whatever they can to hang onto male students. They’ll give them scholarships… So boys move fairly quickly up the ranks.” she said. “And women, even if they’re given the first rung of a job, are mostly kept in the studio.”
Yntema’s research suggested a difference between the cultures at the male-run companies, which are typically larger, and the female-run ones, which tend to be smaller. Speaking to what different leaders have said they would do with a limited budget, Yntema noted that male leaders tended to talk about a big piece or a new center to build, indicating what she calls “a narrow, simplistic view of… excellence.”
In contrast, Artistic Director of Dayton Ballet Karen Burke’s response was one that Yntema said she would never forget. She recalled Burke getting emotional before saying she would spend money to take care of her dancers first. To Yntema, this showed that female artistic directors value their dancers as people, especially in smaller companies where directors “really rely on their relationship” with them.
She said the pandemic has exacerbated the differences across various ballet companies as the performing arts world is experiencing a “growing income and resources disparity.”
Though she hopes that her work will start to move the needle, Yntema acknowledges that the change in the industry won’t be immediate.
“If you are trying to move a multibillion dollar global entity with a culture that prides itself on being as conservative as possible, it's going to be a slow haul,” she said. Still, she believes strongly in the importance of pushing relevant data about gender statistics in the ballet world into the public’s eye. She hopes this will heighten public awareness of the imbalance and encourage audiences to hold ballet companies more accountable.
This public awareness is crucial. Yntema argues the source of the underlying inequities is the lack of care — or even awareness — from the audience.
“People sort of leave their intelligence at the entrance of the theater when they walk in. They just want to be entertained, and they don’t want to think about this stuff,” she said. “But they need to because there’s real people there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ridley Scott threw Twitter into disarray last month when he said superhero movies are “fucking boring as shit” and that their scripts “aren’t any fucking good.” However inflammatory it was, the tweet raises larger questions about the state of superhero films.
It’s true that superhero movies tend to follow a pretty set structure. An ordinary person attains superhuman abilities, they train, they find out about some kind of evil or injustice, they face trials and tribulations, there is a climactic battle where the world looks on, and then the superhero returns to find their life has changed. While this does describe most superhero movies, there is some deviation. Recently, superhero movies have been set in the horror and crime genres, in sitcoms and as satire, they can be comedies or moody and serious. There is some creativity in some of the premises and characters in the superhero genre in recent years, but they have achieved various levels of success. But is the structure itself stale?
The market is definitely oversaturated. Nowadays, it’s impossible to discuss superhero movies without acknowledging the MCU and DCEU. Both are behemoths, with staggering budgets and products that they churn out several times a year. DC is known to struggle much more with quality, though Marvel has had its share of rubbish. Not to mention that in addition to films there are also dozens of TV shows — thousands of hours of the development of the superhero, facing countless foes and being tested. It certainly is getting ridiculous. Yet people are still going to see these films. They continue to be blockbusters. Why should studios deviate from the superhero formula if it has been so financially successful?
Ridley Scott says that three of his movies are superhero movies: “Alien,” “Gladiator” and “Blade Runner.” And sure, they could be viewed through that lens — but that isn’t what they are and it’s a bit disingenuous to say so. Scott went on to ask, “Why don’t the superhero movies have better stories?” in reference to the homogeneity of the genre and says that they are “mostly saved by special effects,” something that is “boring … if you’ve got the money.”
Are superhero movies entertaining because they’re flashy and fun? Scott does make an excellent point that modern movie giants like Marvel and DC need to learn that practical effects still exist and are often better than green screening everything, but not everything needs to be high art. Then again, this is a bit of a cop out. There can be redeeming qualities in “simplistic” art. There are some fantastic moral questions that can be posed about character, about the world, the way we view crime and hardship and power, what it means to be responsible for other people or confront ideas of good and evil, and so much more.
For everyone beleaguered by the volume of superhero movies being pumped out today, there are a few superhero films that speak to why this genre of expression deserves to endure. “Unbreakable” and “The Dark Knight Rises” are impeccable explorations of morality and pain. “V for Vendetta” and “Watchmen” confront surveillance and freedom. “Kickass” and “Deadpool” satirise the familiar, while presenting brilliant stories in their own right. From the MCU, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” and “Thor: Ragnarok” are some of the best it has to offer. “Logan,” featuring the aged hero struggling to believe there is good in the world, is an epic of endurance. From the DCEU, “Wonder Woman” and “Birds of Prey” are brilliant, and according to some, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” also deserves a mention. “Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse” and “The Incredibles” are animations that reinvent the hero’s journey and exemplify what a superhero movie should try to do. Hell, even “Sky High” is fantastic. There is something in this genre that makes people want to watch 25 Marvel movies about some mediocre guy getting superpowers in contemporary America (though moving away from the mediocre white dude as the protagonist of every movie has been a slow going but excellent move for superhero movies).
The superhero genre may be less malleable than, say, the horror genre, but it is not as static as some of Marvel’s cookie cutter films might suggest. While even some subversions of superhero tropes are becoming passe — a consequence of the insane amount of interaction with this genre — the superhero is clearly compelling, even if Hollywood taking a break to make some other movies for a while wouldn’t be a bad thing.
So perhaps there is nothing new to do in the genre. But the same could be said for many other genres. As it currently stands, there is certainly a lot of work to be done. Scott makes a salient point when he says most of the scripts today are “fucking boring.” But I have hope.
