After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
A recent op-ed raised a number of concerns about the track and cross country teams and asked “the administration to intervene to ensure that all student-athletes are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.” On behalf of Harvard Athletics, I want to state unequivocally that our first priority is the health and well-being of our students. As noted in The Crimson’s previous reporting, the administration launched an extensive investigation earlier this year into concerns raised about this team. That process has now concluded, and it revealed a number of areas that must be addressed. These include concerns regarding nutritional support, training, and team culture. The Athletics Department is currently in the process of implementing the recommendations resulting from the investigation and is committed to making visible and meaningful progress.
Robert L. Scalise is the John D. Nichols ’53 Family Director of Athletics at Harvard University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Business School and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will offer a joint master’s program intended for “future leaders of technology ventures,” the two schools announced Tuesday.
The two-year program will award students both a Master of Science in Engineering Sciences and a Master of Business Administration, according to a press release, and is meant to “provide a strong foundation in general management, build design skills, and extend students’ understanding of engineering.”
“The faculty who created this program designed it specifically to bridge the divide between engineering and business for aspiring leaders in the tech sector,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said in the press release.
During the full-time program—including summer and January term classes—students will be enrolled at both schools. During the first year, they will primarily focus on completing the basic MBA curriculum, though they will also take a SEAS System Engineering course. The second year will be spent in electives from both schools, including a mandatory Integrated Design course and a capstone project.
The program will also feature several new courses taught jointly by Business and Engineering School faculty.
The schools seek to enroll around 30 students in the program annually, according to the Business School’s website.
Applications to the program’s first cohort will be due in two rounds in September 2017 and January 2018, and the first MS/MBA students will matriculate in August 2018. College seniors will be required to apply through the Business School’s “2+2” program, which defers matriculation for at least two years of full-time work.
Applicants will be required to have an undergraduate degree in engineering, computer science, or a similar field, as well as at least two years of full-time work experience. Applicants must also independently meet the requirements for admission to the Business School’s MBA program and the Engineering School’s MS program.
The Business School now offers six joint degree programs, including partnerships with the Law School, the Medical School, the Dental School, and two with the Kennedy School of Government. The Engineering School offers a joint degree program with the Graduate School of Design.
The announcement comes as the Engineering School prepares to move to Allston, which will bring it into close proximity to the Business School campus.
Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said that the upcoming physical proximity of the two schools helped spur the development of this program.
“The expansion of SEAS to a state-of the-art science and engineering complex across the street from HBS presents a compelling opportunity to leverage the resources of our schools,” he said in the release.
In an interview in April, Nohria said he looked forward to greater collaboration between the Business School and Harvard’s other schools.
“We’re trying to see if some amount of joint teaching is one way in which our faculty members learn how to work with each other and partner with each other and develop relationships with each other,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Holding up fake gravestones and wearing white lab coats, over 30 Medical School affiliates staged a “die-in” to protest the proposed American Health Care Act on earlier this month at the Medical School’s Tosteson Medical Education Center.
This was part of a nationwide movement protesting the AHCA, which is estimated to cut $834 billion in funding for Medicaid and leave an additional 23 million Americans uninsured by 2026, according to Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government agency.
Last May, the House of Representatives narrowly voted to approve the AHCA. Many Republicans including President Donald Trump, support the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
The event included Medical School students, faculty, physicians, and patients. Speakers shared brief remarks before the “die-in” demonstration.
Medical School instructor Michelle E. Morse described the current lack of moral and civic responsibility physician education as “off track.”
“We as health professionals have to take responsibility for our political education,” she said. “Because if we don’t, we will never achieve our goal of health for all. Health care is a human right, and why don’t we learn that in medical school?”
The participants held up cardboard signs resembling gravestone markers, some of which read “Trumpcare is a Lethal Disease” and “Silence=Death.”
Yuvaram N. V. Reddy, an internal medicine resident at Boston Medical Center, said his patients sometimes ignore his medical advice because it is too expensive.
“The AHCA isn’t just a step backwards, but it’s a harrowing step backwards into an elevator shaft 20 feet down,” he said.
Event organizer and incoming Medical School student Tiantian White said that student activists are considering contacting senators from other states and reaching out to local communities about the potential harmful effects of the proposed bill.
“It would be hard later to sleep at night as we think about the patients who we’re never going to see, who’ll never make it to our clinic because they don’t have the health insurance,” she said. “It would just be unconscionable.”
