After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the release of the campus climate survey results earlier this semester, we once again saw our campus rocked by discussion about sexual violence. Students shared personal narratives, called for peers and administrators to address social spaces and final clubs, and demanded resources and information. In her official statement about the survey results, President Faust wrote that “all of us share the obligation to create and sustain a community of which we can all be proud.” She seemed to redirect concerns about Harvard’s obligations, prioritizing community responsibility over administrator responsibility. The message from Harvard administration is clear: This is our problem.
We agree with President Faust: Sexual violence is our collective problem, and addressing it will take deep investment from every member of the Harvard community. However, our years of activism on this issue on campus have made us skeptical about what Harvard means when they ask what we can all do together.
In the past few years, students have been continually sidelined when it comes to actually influencing important university policies. After a 2012 UC referendum in which 85 percent of the student body voted to see changes to Harvard’s sexual assault policy, Harvard drafted its current University-wide sexual violence policy in a working group that ignored the mandate for a policy that included affirmative consent. Since the rollout of the policy, open meetings by several task forces have taken place, but none of these groups has had the goal or ability to change policy.
Students have been vocal and consistent in their demands, calling for (among other things) yearly trainings, better allocation of social space, and an affirmative consent policy. The audience for President Faust’s forum filled two Science Center Auditoriums, and many asked pointed questions about what the University planned to do in the wake of these results. Students have demonstrated their commitment to these issues, yet extremely few of our voices are heard in actual decision-making processes. Every task force or working group selectively appoints only two or three students to represent the entire student body. This kind of token representation can never be fully adequate for an incredibly diverse and multifaceted community, no matter how open and hardworking the individuals selected. These task forces are not transparent to the population they are working to protect, and as such they are not accountable to the vast community of students that will have to live under whatever decisions they make.
Administrative focus since the survey release has focused on social spaces and final clubs. While cultural change is certainly important, students cannot do this alone. Policy and culture are mutually reinforcing—true cultural change cannot take root without a policy that reflects its values. The administration shares the burden to create a safe campus environment for all and to respond justly to survivors’ needs—and they have yet to admit, let alone truly uphold, their responsibility. The focus on community conversations and community responsibility is meaningless if administrators continue to marginalize student voices in actual policy change on campus.
Students should have input into the policies that affect our lives. We should be included in the process of reform and growth so that our voices actually matter in a community we are supposed to call home. Meetings should be opened to all interested students—even if we disagree with each other around precise policy language, the inclusion of more student voices creates a dialogue, not a monologue, that is necessary for good change. Students cannot have honest conversations about their behavior and values if university policies use language no students can understand. Students cannot feel safe here if they do not believe this university cares about what they have to say.
This week, students will have the opportunity to vote on Our Harvard Can Do Better’s UC referendum question, which reads, "Should Harvard be required to open the meetings of current task forces reviewing sexual violence policy to all interested students?" We see this referendum as the first step towards a broader engagement of students in changing our campus for the better, opening up an avenue for dialogue with one another and with our administration about how to improve all aspects of our community.
We hope our referendum will demonstrate to Harvard administration that students are listening, invested, and will not be silent. If Harvard wants its student community to take ownership, as Faust has indicated time and time again, then they have to facilitate that ownership rather than shut us down at every turn. Students have much to contribute to the conversations about policy reform happening now and that will continue to happen in the future. The first step is to let us into the room. We hope you will vote "yes" to tell the administration to do just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 16, 8:41 p.m.
The turmoil in Paris had barely ended before the upswell of well-meaning solidarity and well-wishing was met with a backlash of equal velocity.
By now, we have all the details memorized: the horrific attack at the Bataclan concert hall that left 89 dead, the suicide bomb at a soccer match that François Hollande was himself attending, the 39 restaurant-goers murdered.
“This is an attack not just on Paris. It’s an attack not just on the people of France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share,” President Barack Obama said.
Less well known are the details of a terrorist attack in Beirut, where two suicide bombers attacked during the evening rush hour, killing at least 43. Two weeks ago, more than 200 Russian citizens were killed in a plane explosion in Egypt that Western intelligence agencies have stated to be the result of a bomb.
No similar outpourings of grief or solidarity were seen, though the very same Islamic State claimed responsibility for the barbarism.
To critics, the different reactions meant something sinister: a crisis of selective empathy, the systematic valuation of white, Western lives over others. “It is not Paris we should pray for. It is the world. It is a world in which Beirut, reeling from bombings two days before Paris, is not covered in the press,” began a widely-shared poem written a few hours after the bombing.
I find moralizing of this sort ultimately incoherent.
Amid the anger and denunciation is a kernel of truth—media coverage of horrific terrorist acts is apportioned based on many factors, like death toll, geographic proximity, and how recurrent the events are. Terrorists striking in Baghdad, which has been sadly repeatedly victimized, garners less attention than a suicide bombing in Beirut, where bombings are less frequent, and even less than the events in Paris, which has not seen such an attack since World War II.
After all, media coverage does not just mold their audience’s interest—audience’s interest also molds media coverage. Who among us was not stricken with fear after more than 100 people were murdered while enjoying concerts, sports, friends, and food on a Friday evening? For as much time and space as news organizations were willing to devote to the Paris attacks, readers and viewers were just as willing to read, to learn, to try to understand how this could happen.
Acknowledging the many factors implicated in the supply and demand of media coverage is a valuable discussion, and there is no guarantee that today’s equilibrium could not be improved.
But where the critics go wrong is when the complexities of the discussion are elided, then conflated and weaponized into a tool of judgment, as sympathy policing, where bad intent is assumed of all well-wishers no matter how little we know of them.
“Where were the vigils over Beirut and Baghdad?” they ask. “Why didn’t Facebook offer a Russian flag filter after the charter plane exploded?”
The critics impose the impossible standard on their fellow man that grief and empathy be exactly apportioned in the proper ratio of casualties, a standard that ignores the legitimate subjective determinants of grief, a standard which no one could possibly meet.
Variants of this contrarian argument crop up even in unrelated debates: partisans on each side of the Israel-Palestine debate frequently accuse the other of insufficient grief when civilians die. The self-importance of these critiques only furthers the intractability of the larger conflict.
Perhaps not everyone draping the French flag over their Friday-night-out pictures is an astute observer of geopolitics. Does that mean that they value the life of a Frenchman over that of an Arab? Probably not.
The specter of sophisticated terrorist attacks, planned under the noses of intelligence officials, with massive casualties in our most secure cities rightly terrifies Americans. To me, what the French are suffering evokes our own grief after September 11, with their new bombing campaign over Syria even resembling the buildup to the American invasion of Afghanistan.
And if Americans want to mourn that with their French flags, so be it. Mourn the French. Mourn the Lebanese. Mourn the Iraqis. But, most of all, let the people mourn how they want.

CORRECTION: November 16, 2015

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday, the Massachusetts legislature’s Labor and Workforce Development Committee approved a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour for workers at corporations with over 200 employees, a measure targeted at large retail and fast food chains. The $15 figure also played prominently in the campaign for Cambridge City Council earlier this month, with City Councilor Nadeem Mazen backing the implementation of a $15 an hour minimum wage for all Cantabrigians. We support both the bill currently in the Massachusetts General Court and Councilor Mazen’s proposal. It is time to raise the minimum wage, and $15 an hour is a logical level in both cases.
In 2014, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick ’78 signed historic legislation raising the state’s $8 per hour minimum wage to $11 per hour by 2017. With Patrick’s increase, Massachusetts is on track to have the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation. But the activist group Fight for 15 has set its sights higher, pushing for a $15 per hour wage for all workers. Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley agree. So far, however, only the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle have adopted $15 an hour minimum wages. It is probably too soon to tell the full effect these decisions will have on employment.
Hillary Clinton, in contrast, favors a slower rise to $12 per hour. She cites Alan Krueger, the Princeton economist who warned in a recent New York Times op-ed that a $15 per hour national minimum wage would be unprecedented, and would risk doing more harm than good for low-wage workers.
The bill in the Massachusetts legislature focuses on larger employers, and therefore tries to skirt the common criticism that a rising cost of labor disproportionately hurts small businesses, and reduces total employment. Republican presidential candidates have advocated against a minimum wage increase, with Donald Trump even arguing that the current wage is “too high.”
Defining a living wage is complicated task that depends on the cost of living, tax rates, and food and energy prices, among other considerations. A wage that works for one city or state may be a job-killer somewhere else. Consequently, the baseline federal minimum wage should be raised, but it should be a lower bound. It should be the responsibility of states and cities with higher costs of living, like Massachusetts and Cambridge, to adopt higher minimum wages—out of fairness as well as a desire for broad-based economic growth.
To avoid a series of politicized battles, governments at all levels should index the minimum wage to inflation. The status quo is a bitter reminder of how inflation can eat away at real wages: The federal tipped minimum wage of $2.13 per hour has been in place since 1991.
Finally, it is time to do away with that special minimum wage for tipped workers. Seven states have already done so. Nationwide, 12.8 percent of tipped workers live in poverty, compared to 6.5 percent of non-tipped workers. Massachusetts does better than some states; tipped employees may be paid at a special rate of $3 per hour, but the employer must make up the difference if the total with tips falls below $9. Still, treating tipped workers differently makes little practical sense, and should end.
Of course, eliminating tipped wages is just one component of increasing the minimum wage for all American workers. With more aggressive local wage policies, a higher federal minimum, and inflation indexing, the minimum wage can once again be a real vehicle for enhancing economic opportunity.

UPDATED: November 16, 2015, at 11:01 p.m.
A bomb threat shook Harvard’s campus on Monday, prompting the evacuation of four buildings in and around Harvard Yard before a five-hour police search proved the threat unfounded. 
In a scene strikingly similar to a scare two years ago, students evacuated Harvard’s Science Center and Sever, Emerson, and Thayer Halls around 12:30 p.m. on Monday after police reported receiving an unconfirmed bomb threat.
With police restricting access to Harvard Yard, locking gates in some places and rolling out caution tape around the Science Center Plaza, officers searched the four locations—three academic buildings and one freshman dorm—on Monday afternoon. Officers concluded around 2:30 p.m. that Emerson and Sever Halls were safe, and all four buildings had reopened five hours after the investigation began.
According to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, officers are conducting an “active and ongoing investigation” to identify the origin of the threat, which police received via email shortly before the evacuation. Catalano declined to comment further. 
For juniors and seniors, the scene and many of the details of Monday were familiar. About two years ago, in the midst of fall semester finals in December 2013, students evacuated those four same buildings after several Harvard affiliates received a bomb threat, also via email, which officials determined was unfounded after a six-hour scare. The student who admitted to sending that threat—Eldo Kim, formerly a member of the College’s Class of 2016—was later charged and entered a pretrial diversion program to avoid jail time.
Students were first notified of Monday’s bomb threat by Harvard Alert texts and emails around 12:30 p.m. on Monday, and the Yard was a swarm of activity shortly after. Cambridge Police had sent officers, detectives, and bomb squad specialists to assist with the investigation, according to spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. Federal law enforcement authorities were also on the scene, including representatives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
In the wake of the scare, a number of classes across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were interrupted or cancelled for the day, including Economics 10—Harvard’s second-largest course—which paused mid-lecture for the evacuation.
Faculty members and staff whose offices were in buildings being searched were advised that they “may leave work for the day or find an alternative place on campus to work,” according to an email from FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79.
Like in 2013, some students gathered in Annenberg Hall as law enforcement officials swarmed the Yard. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana appeared in the freshman dining hall to offer support to students, saying that the College is working to make sure its “students are taken care of.”
“The most important thing is our students’ safety and wellbeing,” he said while walking from Annenberg to Lamont Library, where he also made an appearance.
In notifying Harvard students, faculty, and staff about the threat throughout the day, administrators reiterated the importance of safety and vigilance. The College’s dean of student life, Stephen Lassonde, called the threat “troubling” in an email and reminded students of Harvard’s emergency mental health services. Lapp emphasized the gravity of the threat in light of recent acts of terror around the world. 
“In the wake of recent tragic events in locations ranging from Paris to Beirut and beyond, we understand that this type of threat will cause great anxiety for many across our campuses,” Lapp wrote. “We will continue to be vigilant as we carry on Harvard’s mission of expanding and disseminating knowledge.”
Several other colleges and schools around Massachusetts also received unconfirmed bomb threats on Sunday and Monday morning. There were no changes to the MBTA’s service.

A Cambridge-based organization focused on encouraging STEM engagement for girls recently kicked-off a fundraising campaign. The crowdsourcing endeavor, #StemtoShine, aims to raise $5,000 to support one of the organization’s mentorship programs by December.
Science Club for Girls, the organization behind the campaign, guides elementary school girls in STEM field exploration and provides high school students with STEM-based mentorship and internships. Its programs are often staffed by undergraduate and graduate volunteers from Harvard and other Boston-area universities.
If it reaches its $5,000 goal, Science Club for Girls will have its donations augmented by the Gustave G. and Valla Amsterdam Foundation, which has pledged to match the funds at a ratio of 3:1. The resulting $20,000 would cover the full costs of providing stipends for the group's junior mentor program.
The Science Club for Girls junior mentors work side-by-side with the undergraduate students in leading the programs, assisting in teaching kindergarten through fifth-grade students.
“[The Junior Mentor program] grew out of a desire from some of our participants who, as they aged out of our elementary school program, wanted to continue engaging with science club in some way,” said Lonsdale G. Koester, the executive director of SCFG. “They had a particular interest in giving back and playing the role of a mentor, and so we created the program.”
The program provides a “modest stipend” for the junior mentors to cover the costs of transportation involved in volunteering. If successful, the recently-launched campaign will fund these stipends, which range from $55-$110 depending on mentors’ levels of involvement.
Junior mentors often serve as relatable role models for the program’s elementary school participants, bridging the age gap between university science students and children curious about STEM fields.
“My view of it is this: it's hard when you are in kindergarten to look at a professional working scientist, even if she’s 30, because she just seems ancient,” Koester said. “That imaginative leap between kindergarten and a profession is a lot for a girl to take in.”

Alex Epstein, president and founder of the for-profit think-tank Center for Industrial Progress and author of “The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” argued for the use of fossil fuels on Monday in Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall.
Aladdine Joroff, a clinical instructor and staff attorney in the Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic at the Law School, spoke after Epstein and gave a rebuttal. The event was hosted by the Harvard Federalist Society, a student-run organization for conservatives, moderates, and libertarians.
During his speech, Epstein critiqued the “methodology” of the prevailing energy discussion.
According to Epstein, the fossil fuel debate today places too much trust in “experts.” In addition, Epstein said much of the debate focuses on fossil fuels’ negative effects on the environment, leaving out their positive effects on human beings.
“If we were not free to use fossil fuels...billions of people suffer and die unnecessarily,” Epstein said. “This really calls into question what is the methodology of the people who oppose [fossil fuels]. My contention is, whether implicitly or explicitly, their focus is not human life.”
Epstein also differentiated his arguments in favor of fossil fuels from mainstream political discourse.
“I want to distinguish myself both from the view that you hear from what we can call the left and the right,” he said. “So I don’t think fossil fuels are an unnecessary evil or a necessary evil, I think they are a superior good.”
In her rebuttal, Joroff asserted that opponents of fossil fuel usage want to transition to a cleaner energy supply, not remove the existing energy supply.
“From a moral perspective, I’d argue that we have an obligation to pursue feasible alternatives now,” she said.
Trenton Van Oss, vice president of speakers for the Federalist Society and one of the hosts of the event, said he was pleased with the proceedings.
“[T]hat’s part of our mission at the school, to provide students with points of view that they might not get in the classroom or at other events,” he said. “Alex did that, and Professor Joroff offered a great response.”
Aqil Sajjad, a graduate student in high energy theory physics, said that he thought Epstein was not “nuanced” enough and made strong assertions in a field that “can’t be totally precise.”
“I think that, in the climate debate, demanding precision is not how we should [proceed],” Sajjad said. “If you want precision you should go into physics or chemistry.”

Around 60 students bearing candles gathered on the steps of Memorial Church on Monday evening for a vigil commemorating recent global tragedies. The vigil, which was hosted by the Harvard Foundation, included a moment of silence and brief speeches from members of the Foundation, as well as an open speaking invitation to students wishing to share thoughts on recent violence.
The service comes in the wake of Friday’s Paris terror attacks, which left nearly 130 dead, and aimed to commemorate “those from around the world who have suffered from violence, terrorism, and displacement,” Foundation Director S. Allen Counter said to the assembled crowd. Counter named Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Palestine, and Algeria as other sites of recent violence and tragedy.
“There’s a tendency to kind of empathize more with those we feel more personally connected to, and it’s important to recognize that tragedies happen all over the world,” said foundation intern and vigil organizer Irfan Mahmud ’16, who is also an inactive Crimson editor. “We want to be as inclusive as possible.”
Students appreciated the opportunity to show solidarity with victims of recent violence.
“I’m here to reflect, and just keep it in mind,” Jeffery P. Durand ’17 said. “Things like these should not be forgotten.”
Several students also spoke at the event, expressing sadness at the recent attacks in Paris and gratitude for the support shown at the vigil.
The vigil’s status was unclear for several hours during the day because of the unconfirmed bomb threat that precipitated the evacuation of several nearby buildings and the temporary closure of the Yard. However, Mahmud said that there was no question that the event would be held once the threat had been cleared.
“[Memorial Church] is an important space to have, and even more so in light of the events today,” he said. He added that the scare made it easier for students to empathize with the tragedies overseas.
While Mahmud said that the threat might have hurt the vigil’s attendance, some students said the events of Monday afternoon inspired them to attend.
“When the go ahead was given, I felt that it was even more important to come,” said Juan P. Miramontes ’17.

Members of Harvard College Queer Students and Allies are working with counterparts from Yale to provide BGLTQ-friendly housing for this upcoming Harvard-Yale weekend, during which Harvard students will travel en masse to New Haven, Conn., for the annual rivalry football game against Yale.
More than 30 Harvard students have signed up through the QSA to be hosted by Yale students this year, according to Josh E. Stallings ’17, one of QSA’s co-social chairs. This is not the first time LGBTQ groups at Harvard and Yale have worked together to coordinate housing; Stallings said QSA’s board regards the program as a tradition.
“We’ve had this mutual host program for as long as we can remember and, as far as we know, it was existing for multiple years previously,” Stallings said.
Stallings created a Google form in which students seeking a place to stay for the weekend were able to indicate their gender identities and preferences for hosts. Yale students then disseminated a housing form to potential hosts through their umbrella student organization focused on BGLTQ and allied activism, the LGBTQ Student Cooperative.
Stallings added that the purpose of the program is “to make sure that all students, BGLTQ students included…are safe and happy during Harvard-Yale weekend.”
Stallings noted that, while the hosting program “may seem like something very institutionalized…it doesn’t require that much effort.”
Coordinating the program is “a relatively easy thing to do because people are interested in doing it [and] because people will sign up,” Stallings said.
Alex Borsa, a senior at Yale and former president of Yale’s LGBTQ Co-Op, lauded the BGLTQ hosting program.
Borsa said the program allows LGBTQ students to know “if they are going to a foreign place for a weekend, that they can be hosted by people who understand their identity.”
Borsa added that although this hosting program does not necessarily encapsulate all the hosting that occurs within the BGLTQ community, “it’s great for Yale to show the same hospitality” Harvard shows when The Game is hosted in Cambridge.
“Harvard-Yale is a special time for symmetrical groups from both communities to meet,” Borsa said, adding that the program provides an opportunity to “foster an inter-collegiate community.”

UPDATED: November 17, 2015, at 8:21 p.m.
Despite significant political hurdles, this month’s 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris represents a potentially groundbreaking step forward in controlling global emissions, panelists argued at the Kennedy School of Government on Monday.
As University President Drew G. Faust and panelists spoke, members of activist group Divest Harvard, as well as local activists, protested outside the Kennedy School, chanting for immediate “climate justice.”
The event inside, moderated by Vice Provost for Research Richard McCullough, was the second in a series of University-wide discussions on climate change and was co-hosted by the Office of the President and McCullough’s office.
The first, held last April during a blockade of Massachusetts Hall by Divest Harvard, came after several requests for an open forum made by Harvard Faculty for Divestment, a group of 261 faculty from across Harvard who have signed an open letter urging the University to end its investments in fossil fuel companies.
“Climate change represents a defining issue for our moment in history, one of the paramount challenges of our time,” Faust said during brief opening remarks. “And our challenge is not just to diagnose the problem and the profound hazards that it represents—our challenge is to step up and find effective solutions.”
“My hope is…[advocates for divestment] would begin to focus more on policies that would make a real difference as opposed to policies that make us feel good or look good but don’t really do something about the problem,” Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins said, reiterating the Faust’s stance that research, and not symbolic action, is the University’s core contribution to the climate change effort.
Panelist Coral Davenport, who reports on energy and climate change policy for the New York Times, said during the event that though the Paris talks in many ways seem similar to the discussions leading up to the “partial measures” of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the fact that the U.S. is now entering the discussions with a climate policy on the table is potentially game-changing.
Davenport said, however, that even if a global accord is reached with wide international support, the world will still have a long way to go towards capping global temperatures at two degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average, the long-term goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Stavins said he agreed with Davenport, saying that the new approach of putting all countries under the same legal framework—rather than giving different commitments to OECD countries and others as was done under the Kyoto Protocol—is a significant step forward.
Many countries have also submitted public Intended Nationally Determined Contributions documents in anticipation of the conference, outlining their expected contribution to combatting climate change after 2020 with varying levels of commitment depending on a country’s level of economic development, Stavins said.
“‘Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’—that is part of the framework convention under which all of these negotiations are taking part,” Stavins said. “The agreement that will be reached in Paris does not reject that, it does not repeal that—it’s working under that.”
The panelists also discussed how the political climate in Washington and the Senate’s opposition to U.S. President Barack Obama’s energy policy will affect the United States’ role in the proceedings.
For his part, Zou Ji, deputy director general of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation under the National Development and Reform Commission in China, said he was concerned whether the U.S.’s INDC targets could be implemented regardless of the party in power, especially considering the upcoming 2016 elections.
As at the first forum event in April, Faust did not discuss the topic of divestment during her speech, but the issue was posed repeatedly to the panel during a brief question-and-answer session.
“All of the panel except for one are academics or journalists in the US, and it’s not representing the kind of solutions that we would hope our university would endorse in the context of global solutions,” said Divest Harvard member Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18, adding that the goal of the protest was to share Divest Harvard’s narrative with a broader audience.
After the panel, Divest Harvard member Benjamin Franta, a graduate student in Applied Physics, said he was frustrated by the lack of discussion on what universities can contribute beyond the classroom and laboratory.
“These events are really good, but they don’t go nearly far enough, because they talk about what universities have been doing for literally decades about this problem, and we’ve known that that hasn’t been enough,” Franta said.

Disputing the fundamental ethics of federal funding for abortion, student group representatives squared off in what most spectators described as a notably civil debate hosted by the Harvard Political Union on Monday.
In front of a crowd of about 50 spectators in Sever Hall, students debated the proposition: “The United States government should fund abortion services through Planned Parenthood."
Under the Hyde Amendment, Congress currently mandates that no federal funds given to organizations like Planned Parenthood may be spent on abortions, except in extreme cases like rape and incest.
Arguing in support of the proposition, Sarah S. Fellman ’18 and Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, representatives from the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard International Women’s Rights Association, respectively, said the government ought to fund abortion through Planned Parenthood in order to provide all women with access to a procedure that they characterized as a fundamental healthcare right.
“As it currently stands, you can’t stand for women’s health without standing for legalized abortion,” Fellman said.
Will Long ’18 and Scott Ely ’18, both representatives from Harvard Right to Life, opposed the proposition, arguing that the federal government should not pay for a procedure that Long described as “at best morally questionable; at worst, murder.” Instead, they argued, federal money would be better used to strengthen and expand community health centers that provide health services other than abortions.
“Why should the American people, half of whom believe abortion is morally wrong, give its tax money to one special interest group that specializes in [abortion] when there are so many other clinics that provide women the health services they need and respect the dignity of human life?” Long said.
Spectators noted the relative civility of the debate over an issue that both sides characterized as controversial.
“I appreciated how respectful they were to each other,” Yousra S. Neberai ’18 said. “I feel like a lot of the time people are preaching to the choir and not directly talking to each other.”
Jeff R. Metzger ’17, chair of the Harvard Political Union, noted the importance of facilitating this kind of discussion on such a divisive topic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard’s own admissions practices face widespread scrutiny, a group of undergraduates debated the merits of affirmative action on Monday, many coming out in support of the consideration of race in admissions decisions.
A lawsuit, filed last year, accuses Harvard and its use of race-based affirmative action of discriminating against Asian American applicants, and University officials have been quick to defend their policies. Speaking at Memorial Church in September, University President Drew G. Faust reiterated Harvard’s commitment to enrolling a diverse student body and pledged a “vigorous defense” against the lawsuit.
At a more than hour-long discussion hosted by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations on Monday, dozens of students—many of them members of cultural organizations—weighed in on the issue.
William Oh ’18 argued that the lawsuit against Harvard falsely suggests that Asian Americans tend to oppose race-based affirmative action, noting that “Asian organizations have come out in support of affirmative action.”
“This lawsuit is very emblematic about that in that Asian Americans are now being used to pit against other minority groups,” Oh said.
In addition to voicing support for affirmative action as a whole, participants discussed whether affirmative action policies should primarily seek to address past injustices against historically marginalized groups or if they should simply serve to increase campus diversity.
Most students agreed, however, that the College would lose its diverse student body were its affirmative action policies struck down.
“I would say I think that [not] having race as a factor...would result in a substantially less diverse class,” Faith A. Jackson ’16 said, adding that Harvard should not consider an individual application’s quality without taking the candidate’s background into account.
Harvard administrators, too, have advanced a similar argument to defend the admissions practices that are currently under fire. Although the 2014 lawsuit has been delayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, another affirmative action case, experts say Harvard has a lot at stake in the ongoing debate about affirmative action.
Lawyers for Harvard recently submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, urging it to uphold the constitutionality of affirmative action in the Fisher case. Lawyers for Harvard argued that a decision against the legality of race-based affirmative action would force the College to be “willfully blind to the continuing relevance of race in our society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, in the middle of December 2013 final exams, Harvard students received an unsettling email from University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp detailing “an unconfirmed report that explosives may have been placed in four buildings on campus: the Science Center, and Thayer, Sever and Emerson halls.”
On Monday, Lapp sent another message: There was again an “unconfirmed bomb threat” in those four campus building; meanwhile, a swarm of law enforcement officials were combing through the same classrooms and common rooms in search of explosives.
In both cases, police deemed all four buildings safe following an investigation.
The eerie familiarity of the threat, together with the recency of fatal bombings in Paris and Beirut, imbued the series of evacuations and investigations on Monday with particular weight for some students.
“I tried to say to myself that it was likely a fake,” said Anna Lea Albright ’17. “But in the wake of the Paris attacks everything has a different seriousness.”
And some students, particularly juniors and seniors, recalled a day in 2013—when then-sophomore Eldo Kim sent Harvard officials an emailed bomb threat—with particular clarity on Monday as similar events unfolded throughout the afternoon. Kim’s bomb threat, which he later confessed was an attempt to skip a final exam, resulted in evacuations of the Yard and canceled examinations.
After evacuating the Science Center on Monday, Tiphanie C. Fuentes ’16 and several friends regrouped in a nearby cafe. One friend dug up emergency messages from 2013 and compared them to those sent that afternoon. When Fuentes saw them, she said she thought, “Oh my God, it’s really happening again?”
Later in the afternoon, while she waited in the cafe for updates on the bomb threat investigation, Fuentes recalled the 2013 story to one of her sophomore friends who had not been a College student at the time.
And though many classes in the Yard were canceled while law enforcement officials conducted their search, Philip J. Abboud ’17 said he thought the bomb threat Monday drew a “less concerned” response from Harvard officials than did the 2013 threat. While the investigation lasted hours into Monday afternoon, some buildings reopened to students and faculty and many classes scheduled to take place were not altered. Once Sever and Emerson Halls were deemed safe, Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ dean for administration and finance, sent an email to FAS affiliates encouraging professors to continue classes as normal.
“[I]n the interest of minimizing the need to reschedule classes, faculty and/or TFs who have classes or sections in Sever and Emerson are encouraged to hold them if possible,” she wrote.
Still, though, the recent attacks in Paris and Beirut—which left scores dead—evoked a more somber tone to Monday’s attacks for some Harvard students, faculty, and administrators.
“In the wake of recent tragic events in locations ranging from Paris to Beirut and beyond, we understand that this type of threat will cause great anxiety for many across our campuses,” Lapp wrote in her initial email to Harvard affiliates.
Even for some students who were skeptical of an actual bomb threat, the recent events made Monday’s evacuations feel more legitimate.
“The events in Paris and Beirut showed that there really is almost nowhere left that is totally safe,” Abboud said. “It’s worrying that something like that could happen in our own backyard.”
Alarms in Sever Hall ended History professor Peter E. Gordon’s class, Culture and Belief 50: “The European Postwar,” early.
“Paris was very much on my mind,” said Gordon, who specializes in European History. “I even mentioned it at the start of my lecture and meant to return to it at the end of the lecture.”
Astronomy professor Jonathan E. Grindlay, who had to cancel his class, Science of the Physical Universe 21: “Stellar Understanding of the Cosmos,” said it was “disappointing” that a bomb threat disrupted campus, especially in the wake of the Paris attacks.
“It was really frustrating,” Grindlay said, “that we had to have an aftershock, let's call it that, of all the horrible events that occurred in Paris.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Police have not identified the source of an unfounded bomb threat that disrupted Harvard’s campus on Monday.
The investigation into the source of the emailed bomb threat on campus Monday is “active and ongoing,” according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano. He declined to comment further on the origin of the threat. 
On Monday afternoon, the Science Center, Emerson, Sever, and Thayer Halls were evacuated after HUPD received a report of a bomb threat. Local and federal law enforcement officials descended on Harvard Yard and conducted a five-hour search of the four buildings. By 5:30 p.m., police deemed the locations safe.
The evacuations prompted class cancellations and postponements. Additionally, Undergraduate Council Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 extended the voting window for this week’s UC election by nine hours to accommodate for complications caused by the bomb threat and an issue with the online voting interface. Voting will now close on Thursday at 9 p.m.
In 2013, local and federal law enforcement investigated a similarly unfounded bomb threat in the same four campus buildings. Police traced the emailed threat to Eldo Kim, formerly a member of the College’s Class of 2016, who admitted he had made the threat so he would not have to take a final exam. Kim was later charged and entered a pretrial diversion program.
Both the recency of Kim’s fraudulent threat and fatal attacks in Paris and Beirut last week made Monday’s threat all the more eerie for some students.
According to Catalano, a report of “suspicious activity” at the Science Center at 10:33 a.m. on Monday was unrelated to the bomb threats.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore midfielder Christian Sady scored two goals over the weekend to lead Harvard men’s soccer to a 6-0 win over Penn and earn Athlete of the Week honors. Aside from the North Andover, Mass. native, four other Crimson athletes put in impressive performances this week to earn spots on the runners up list.
Oliver White, Men’s Soccer
Sady was not the only member of men’s soccer to turn in a strong performance, as teammate and senior forward White notched three assists and drew a penalty in Harvard’s rout of the Quakers. The attacker played a critical role in the team’s quick start to the game, setting up two goals in the first half to put the Crimson up, 4-0, at the end of the first period. White went on to create a penalty chance when he was brought down by the Penn keeper in the box and also assisted Harvard’s final goal of the night. The senior has contributed three scores of his own this season, as well.
Ben Braunecker, Football
Although the Crimson saw its 22-game win streak snapped by Penn, the senior tight end had a record-setting day as he ran for a career-high 134 receiving yards. The loss marked the fourth time in the last five games that Braunecker has tallied over 100 receiving yards, as the senior amassed nearly half of Harvard’s total yardage on the day by himself. The Ferdinand, Ind. native currently leads the Crimson in receptions, with 42, and has run for a team-high 762 receiving yards this season.
Shilpa Tummala, Women’s Basketball
The senior guard shined over the weekend, as she recorded a career-high 17 points in a loss to Maine. Tummala sank five of 10 three-point efforts and added three rebounds and two steals. This marked the 10th time in the senior’s career that she has racked up more than 10 points in a game.
Merrick Madsen, Men’s Ice Hockey
The sophomore netminder proved his worth in his third start of the season, as he turned away 38 shots to lead Harvard over Princeton, 3-0. The game marked the first time this year that Princeton has been held scoreless. Madsen has already recorded 81 saves this season while allowing just two goals, and the Crimson is 3-0-0 with the Acton, Calif. native between the pipes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team’s season came to an end on Saturday, but not before the senior class left one last mark on the program. Netting the Crimson’s final four goals of 2015, the seniors stole the show at Jordan Field as Harvard steamrolled through Penn, 6-0.
But on a night devoted to the seniors, who also produced five assists in their final game, it was Harvard’s star underclassman who initiated the rout.
One season after lifting the Crimson (9-6-2, 5-2 Ivy) over the Quakers (3-11-2, 1-5-1) with his 89th-minute heroics, sophomore midfielder Christian Sady again proved too much for Penn to handle in the teams’ season finale. But this time, the North Andover, Mass., native did without the dramatics.
Sprinting up the left wing in his signature pink cleats, Sady fed senior forward Oliver White at the top of the box without breaking his stride, just eight minutes into the contest. After splitting two defenders without the ball on the 18-yard line, Sady immediately looked to White to complete the give-and-go.
White returned the ball to the sophomore with his first touch, but for a moment, the pass got away from Sady, shooting off his left foot in the direction of the goaltender. But in a two-man race against the charging keeper, the sophomore won the battle, getting his left foot under the ball with just enough space to get it over the head of Penn goalie Etan Mabourakh.
Three minutes later, Sady was at it again. After a Quaker defender knocked the ball away from the sophomore deep in the attacking zone, every member of the Penn defense retreated towards the box in preparation for a long ball from Harvard’s throw-in specialist, senior Michael Klain.
But the long ball never came. Instead, Klain gave the ball to Sady standing just a few yards away on the right wing. Taking advantage of the space in front of him, Sady inched towards the center of the field. And five yards beyond the edge of the penalty area, the midfielder dipped a cross towards the near post.
Making a run in that direction, senior forward Michael Innocenzi swung his right foot to blast a shot past Mabourakh. But the senior failed to connect. However, with Innocenzi blocking Mabourakh’s line of vision, the ball skipped its way into the side of the net, turning the senior’s swing-and-miss into strike number two for Sady.
Saturday marked the first multi-goal performance of Sady’s career, earning him the honor of Ivy League Co-Player of the Week alongside senior Jake Freeman, who also scored twice on Saturday.
Sady entered the weekend with just one goal to his name—an insurance marker in a 2-0 win over Cornell on Oct. 10, but after the sophomore recorded that first score, co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu knew that there would be more to come.
“It’s nice to see [Sady and classmate Sam Brown] score because it lessens the load a little bit,” said Wheeler-Omiunu after the Cornell win. “It’s more likely for them to score again because they have that extra bit of confidence.”
Despite the lack of goals prior to the season finale, Sady represented the offense’s driving force for the whole season. As the Crimson’s free-kick specialist, the midfielder tallied two assists off set pieces—three in total. As Harvard’s most skillful ball handler, Sady produced a number of other chances without getting his name on the stat sheet.
Sady played in all but one game for the Crimson in 2015 after breaking onto the scene with an impressive rookie campaign. As a freshman, he played in 12 of Harvard’s 17 contests, recording two goals and a team-high five assists.
“Christian is exceptional with his passing—he is a pro-level passer,” said Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer after the Crimson’s 2014 season finale. “Any freshman who can come in and have five assists, that’s a pretty significant impact.”
Next year, Sady’s role is expected to expand even more. With four of Harvard’s top five point-getters set to graduate in May, Lehrer will likely have to reshape his offense in order to compete for a conference title in 2016. And odds are, Sady will be right in the middle of it.
“Christian has been a huge asset and he is only going to get better,” Lehrer said last year. “As his defending improves, as his mentality of grittiness in how he defends improves, he is going to be one of the best players in the country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2015-2016 season marks a fresh start for the Harvard men’s and women’s squash teams. The men’s side graduated three of its seniors from last year, while the women’s team lost five, including star Amanda Sobhy ’15, who led the team to a championship last season.
This year, the seniors and juniors on the team look to collectively step up, and the time to do so arrived this weekend at the annual preseason Ivy Scrimmages in New Haven, Conn.
Both teams were able to gauge their progress after participating in the event, which was hosted by Yale. The men’s side reached and lost a hard-fought finals match to Yale, 5-4, while the women’s side also reached the finals but lost to Penn, 7-2.
“We got to the finals, which means a lot of the guys played pretty well for the first two rounds,” senior Peter Janulis said. “The Ivy scrimmages are always just a time to assess how participants in the Ivy League are doing, and it’s not a cause for concern if there are a few missteps as we play.”
Janulis provides experience to a team that features eight freshmen and sophomores. He went 4-0 as a freshman but sat out a large portion of his junior year.
“Generally speaking, we were forced to play with a few injuries, and kids are just coming back to peak performance,” Janulis added. “It was definitely closely fought match—a lot of our team played well. Kids are coming back on the ladder.”
Providing a consolation for the loss in the finals were the encouraging first two rounds of the scrimmages for Harvard. The Crimson swept Brown 9-0 in the quarterfinals, and easily handled Penn 8-1 in the semifinals.
“The entire team played very strongly,” junior captain Devin McLaughlin said, adding that he was impressed by the play of the freshmen.
Janulis emphasized the importance of getting the freshmen’s feet wet and saw encouraging signs in how they responded.
“It was definitely a good opportunity to acclimate the freshman,” Janulis said. “A lot of them haven’t played in a U.S. collegiate setting. We ended up seeing really good stuff from the freshmen in particular, which has really good implications for how they’ll perform later. Sometimes kids get freaked out by the whole environment, but our guys played some pretty phenomenal squash.”
The play of its respective freshmen will be a key to both teams going forward.
“It’s the first time the freshmen are competing,” sophomore Alyssa Mehta said. “Both freshmen competed this weekend, and they both did a very good job.”
Although it lost to the Penn women’s team in the finals, the women can find positives in its 9-0 sweeps of Brown and Yale in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively.
“We’re excited to finally off the season,” sophomore Sue Ann Yong said. “Scrimmages are always nice to check up on how other teams are looking, and more importantly, checking on how we’re looking.”
The Harvard women’s team closed out last season with a 10-match winning streak, but things may not be so easy this year. The team graduated three players off of last year’s top nine, and according to Yong, the loss of the seniors may have played a factor in the loss to Penn.
“We had a good weekend, but there’s definitely a lot to work on,” McLaughlin said after the tournament. “We’ve got to sharpen up for sure, everyone’s got to get fitter. Fortunately, we have a lot of time to improve and get up to par.”

Jeremy Lin ’10 (PG, Charlotte Hornets - NBA)
The most successful Harvard basketball alum has started the season like seasons past. Lin has settled into a role as a solid backup point guard to Kemba Walker. This season he has averaged a steady 11.5 points and 2.9 assists in an average of 22 minutes a game. This year he has a clear role on the team. His team, the Charlotte Hornets, are currently 10th in the Eastern Conference with a record of 5-5. Lin led his team to back to back victories on Tuesday and Wednesday beating Minnesota and the Knicks, scoring 19 and 17 points, respectively, in the two wins.
Desmond Bryant ’09 (DE, Cleveland Browns – NFL)
Bryant continues to impress, albeit on losing teams. After four years with the Oakland Raiders, Bryant now plies his trade for the Cleveland Browns. Since arriving in Cleveland three years ago, Bryant has started every game that he has been available for. However, he has never been on a winning team. Bryant registered a sack each in games against Arizona and Cincinnati but in Sunday’s game against Pittsburgh, the O-line held him to just two tackles.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 (QB, New York Jets - NFL)
Former Harvard and current New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick suffered a close loss against upstate rivals Buffalo last Thursday. He had two touchdowns and two interceptions on a night where he only threw for 193 yards with a completion percentage of 44 percent. On Thursday night Fitzpatrick was well below his average QB rating of 85.5 with a score of 57.6. After a strong month, the loss drops the Jets to third in the AFC Eastern Division with a 5-4 record.

After a few weeks of oddly warm and spectacular weather, unfortunately the bitter cold of the fall we know and love has finally arrived in Cambridge. At the very least, it was bitter for those who hail from warmer climates like the South or Cali. For those who forgot their winter wardrobe, gain some inspiration from people passing by in the Yard:
Ericardo H. Edwards ‘19 and Carmella T. Verrastro ‘19 sport trendy fall looks. Edwards’ khaki jacket and distressed leather shoes give him a hipster look while Verrastro’s chunky knit sweater and her peacoat-sweater combo makes for a warm autumn look. Students can use this look to walk around the streets of Cambridge or even on those rare occasions, get out of the Harvard bubble and go out into Boston!
Nicola White, Robyn Davies, Laura Convery, and Malin Hagman (left to right) are fall fashionistas from the U.K. and Sweden. They are all about those knee-length coats, which is very different from the usual Canada Goose jackets students tend to love. In Cambridge, the sun still comes out when the weather gets colder, so a cool pair of shades like Hagman’s can spruce up any outfit...or hide the many bags under your eyes after pulling your 5th straight all-nighter.
Bettina A. Edelstein ‘19 made sure that her head wasn’t at all neglected: the faux fur trim kept her toasty. Most importantly, she kept her hands warm with a hot coffee from Au Bon Pain. All students should sport this accessory, especially when coming out of Lamont at 4 a.m or walking to the midterm they didn’t really study for.

Grad student Max W. D. Murray’s classic leather jacket is a must-have for any artsy person’s closet. The vintage, distressed look makes you want to ask him where he got it from. Even if it is missing a button, this is the coolest leather jacket you will see in the Yard.
Caroline M. Tervo ‘18 proves that you can be chic and warm at the same time. You can’t go wrong with black! This look is especially great for all the interviews and events you have to attend before landing your future career in McKinsey or Goldman Sachs.
I stopped Solomon Lee ‘19 on his way to get a haircut. He said that this has been his most comfortable outfit yet: pajamas. Anything goes in the Yard—just throw on a jacket and you’ll be fine. This look is great for acting like you just came from the MAC when you didn’t actually exercise. It’s also a campus favorite for the wonderful P-set and Chill.

Harvard-Yale is the one chance that students here have to be normal college students. By now, you have hopefully begun thinking about how you might actually transport yourself to Yale, whether or not you might need a place to stay, and the possibility of freezing because of rainy weather during the game. All you’re missing is love– specifically, love in the form of a hot Yalie who is in need of consolation following a brutal football defeat. Fortunately, Flyby has a solution.
The social app Radiate is a combination of Tinder and Twitter for events ranging from music festivals to NYC nightlife to college parties. To spice up your weekend, download the app on your phone and join the “Harvard-Yale” event.
Step One: Edit your profileRadiate automatically creates your profile by connecting to Facebook and using your first five profile pictures. To ensure high success rate, Flyby suggests that you check your profile before you start to swipe. No one wants to see that awkward profile picture from 2011, and if you’re looking for a significant other donning blue, it might be risky for all your photos to feature Harvard attire.
Step Two: Swipe it upThis is by far the most delicate part of the process. Swiping right a fellow Harvard student or a past TF can be awkward. Look out for the over-filtered and dark pictures, the intense half-face selfies (what does the other half of their face look like?), and group photos.
It’s not surprising that the Harvard-Yale Tinder is predominately composed of “the partiers” and “the nerds”. While those who party pose with tight dresses or suits, one or two friends, and a solo cup, the intellectuals’ profiles resemble the Common Application, with pictures that highlight their academic accomplishments and recreational interests. Pick a side, and start to swipe.
Step Three: Start the ConversationIt’s always exciting when you finally find an attractive and normal person who is also interested in you. To make sure you don’t scare them off, start with a simple “heyyy”. Feel free to use emojis here and there to be cute, but don’t over-do them or you may come off as #basic.
People attend Harvard-Yale for a variety of reasons, occasionally to watch football, but most often to socialize with friends both new and old. Finding love in the form of a hookup may not be your top priority this weekend, but if it is, Radiate just must have the solution for you.

Brunch is hands-down the best meal. If you can find a restaurant that does full justice to it, you just have to share the news with everyone. Ball Square Café fits the bill. A small, local café in Somerville, it boasts huge portions, great service, and homestyle cooking.
HOW TO GET THERE
Although about a 20 minute ride on the 96 bus from the Harvard Square T Station, my friends and I decided –for convenience sake– to Uber over instead.
SERVICE
Charismatic OwnerMike Moccia, co-owner of Ball Square Café, made his way down the long line, greeting his regular customers and exchanging pleasantries with new ones. When he reached me and my three friends, he paused to give us a round of high fives (we liked him immediately).
Efficient Seating SystemAlthough we were initially told that it would be around a 40-minute wait, by some miracle, we only waited for 15 minutes. Because we were a party of four, and there was only one party of four ahead of us, we bypassed the whole line of disgruntled parties of two. We got so many dirty looks that we felt like we were those “FastPass” jerks at Disney World who get to cut the line for all the best rides.
Heaters in LineBecause we had refrained from eating any food in anticipation of this sumptuous feast, we were unhappy to see that the line snaked out the door and down the street. However, because of a series of glowing red heaters installed just above our heads, we were kept toasty and warm from the nippy November air. Major points for customer service.
HIGHLIGHTS
Huge portion sizesUnless you have a big appetite like my friends and I did, be prepared to bring home a doggy bag full of leftovers for later (excuse not to eat dhall food).

The Coconut Macaroon French ToastMike, the co-owner, told us about his newest innovation– a coconut macaroon French Toast with raspberry drizzle. Much to our delight, he offered to bring out a plate just for us. And it was beyond magical. Crunchy on the outside because of the coconut, yet soft and delicate on the inside, the texture was perfect, and the raspberry drizzle was an impeccable complement to the coconut and the raspberry drizzle was an impeccable complement to the coconut. TL;DR, don’t leave without ordering this.
