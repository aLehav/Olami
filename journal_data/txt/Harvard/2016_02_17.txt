After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It must be tough being a Wall Street executive these days—private jets and holiday bonuses notwithstanding. The public can’t stand you, leading presidential figures on both the left and the right have sworn to take you down, and millions of Americans crowded in to see "The Big Short," a movie that showed Main Street how Wall Street defrauded the world through reckless negligence and greed. It seems to me that the only thing that small town America hates more than the names Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are ISIS and Vladimir Putin.
Wall Street has an enormous impact on this campus as well. But our campus culture views it in a different light than the majority of Americans. Just last year, over a third of Harvard’s graduating seniors went on to jobs in finance or consulting. Students grind themselves into the dirt to make sure their resumes are in tip-top condition for select firms, some of which have hiring rates of as low as three percent. And it is a well-known fact that one of the perks of going here is that top companies send recruiters exclusively to Harvard and other peer institutions, skipping out on schools with less name recognition. Our house and club lists are constantly flooded with emails from recruiters, inviting us to recruitment fairs and letting us know about job opportunities. These emails don’t just go to seniors either: Just the other day, I saw an email from Morgan Stanley on the Pforzheimer House list written explicitly for sophomores, and It's common knowledge here that the recruitment grind is a key part of junior year for many Harvard students. I’ve seen classmates compare job offers from big firms like folks used to compare baseball cards. And why not? With starting salaries between $85,000 and $110,000 right out of college (i.e. over twice the salary of my mother, a public school teacher of 25 years), what’s not to love?
Excuse my sarcasm. I get carried away sometimes. But to be perfectly honest, I’m tired, and more than a bit disillusioned. Growing up, going to Harvard was a pipe-dream. I never knew anyone growing up who went to school here, and no one from my high school had been an undergrad here in almost four decades. In my mind, Harvard could do no wrong. It was the place where future world changers, innovators, and philosophers worked together to learn from the greats, and where the greats went to accumulate enough knowledge and information and resources to revolutionize the world. Since I was five years old I wanted to come here — even then recognizing the reverence in any voice speaking of Harvard — so that I too could add to the conversation in any way possible. Some kids dream of the NFL, the NBA, or being president of the United States. My dream was to attend Harvard University.
I still love Harvard. But I believe the University and its leadership are failing to maintain the academic and civic focus long associated with our name. In my mind, and in the mind of millions throughout the world, it is Harvard’s and similar institutions’ responsibility to educate and instill a strong moral code into future world leaders — a goal  espoused by Harvard itself with its mission statement. Idealism should still guide the course of every undergraduate, confident that here world-changers are created, polished, and then sent out into the world with a sense of purpose.
By allowing Wall Street to have unparalleled influence and to shape our campus culture without any sort of pushback, Harvard ties itself and its students up to an institution that perpetuates the gross disparities of wealth in America and throughout the world. The soul-crushing free for all to receive a job offer from these institutions diminishes the academic culture of our campus, and heightens feelings of uncertainty when passions and interests that got students admitted in the first place no longer seem marketable.  Because of this, our school fails to live up to its name and its reputation as an academic institution tasked with training the world’s most gifted minds to be the sort of leaders that our world and our country so desperately need.
Ultimately, though, our students are the ones who make the decisions of what to do after graduation. It’s not my or anyone’s place to judge someone for going into finance because he or she comes from a background without much means, and it’s also true that some students are legitimately passionate about finance and consulting and view it as a career. For too many—and I would argue the majority of students— these industries represent a temporary stopgap, a place where passions and interests are sacrificed for paychecks and security. Simply put, many of us feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to “succeed,” to do something that validates all the time, effort, and money spent on our education here.
Understanding where students are coming from, I believe that Harvard could do much more to prevent finance and consulting from having a near monopoly over pre-graduation uncertainty, with options that include potentially creating new University post-graduate programs that foster participants’ passions and interests or subsidizing the salary of students from low income backgrounds who choose to go into the public sector. Because with all of the diverse interests and talent that comes into our school, and with all of the under serviced places in the world that need leadership, passion, and resources, Harvard must stand up to Wall Street’s attempts to drain our talents into one bloated sector with highly questionable social impact.
Harvard must realize that our nation’s citizens—from economists, to politicians, all the way to the average American—are increasingly pushing back against Wall Street’s influence on society. Recognizing this, shouldn’t our administration push back against Wall Street’s influence over its own student body? Shouldn’t this be part of Harvard’s commitment to “creating and sustaining the conditions that enable all Harvard College students to experience an unparalleled educational journey?”
Maybe I’m too idealistic. It is certainly possible that a more cynical view is correct, that Harvard’s administration recognizes the hold that Wall Street has on our student body and, always mindful of maintaining its hefty endowment, views lucrative finance and consulting jobs as a guaranteed way to get the greatest amount of money in donations from alumni. But I choose to believe Harvard when it says that it wants to be the single defining force that turns great minds into great citizens, with an influence on our lives more powerful than any other institution. And I believe that if our administrators take an active role in curbing the influence that Wall Street has on this campus, we will be that much closer to regaining our focus as a world class institution where world class leaders are made.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When my alarm announces the arrival of 0515 Wednesday morning, I know the pain train’s back in town. For Army cadets, Wednesdays bring Leadership Labs, an ROTC requirement best described as a course on tactics. More importantly, Leadership Labs mean cadets must wear their Army Combat Uniforms.
Although the ACU was designed to camouflage its users, for me, the uniform attracts nothing but awkward attention. Upon joining ROTC, I didn’t think the ACU would affect my Harvard life all that much. After all, I had no intention of wearing the uniform outside of ROTC training.
However, that was before I was introduced to the primary dilemma facing cadets everywhere: getting to Leadership Lab from class on time without sacrificing dinner. Initially, I planned to leave section at 1700, eat dinner by 1715, change into my ACU by 1725, and leave for the MIT ROTC Unit by 1735. However, my plan failed to account for the difference between Army Time and Harvard Time. You see, Harvard and the military don’t see eye to eye with regard to timeliness.
On campus, Harvard Time reigns supreme; if you’ve got a meeting at 1800, you’ve got a good seven minutes to procrastinate before you’re officially late. Meanwhile, the military doesn’t ascribe to Super Harvard Time, let alone Harvard Time. Although Leadership Labs start at 1800 on paper, every cadet knows that arriving after 1740 means you’re late. If you plan on arriving to Leadership Lab at 1800, by the time you arrive, cadet command will have already sent two search parties to scour the streets of Boston for your sorry soul.
Thus, I decided to cut dinner from my pre-Lab plan, only to realize that Leadership Labs end long after Harvard’s dining halls close. As a result, my Wednesdays were ending with a growling stomach and a bitter attitude.
To address my hunger, I began to change into my ACU before section, hoping I’d have time to grab a quick meal before leaving for ROTC Land. The plan worked, but it also brought about some interesting side effects. When walking into class in uniform, I feel like I’m on trial. The atmosphere becomes tense; people look at me as if I’m spearheading some sort of military takeover of Harvard. At times, I’ve considered fulfilling the fears of others by launching a fake military coup d’état where Army ROTC seizes control of the Undergraduate Council. However, considering that the Army ROTC program numbers six contracted cadets, I’ve decided to postpone the operation for the time being.
Wednesdays also mean walking in uniform off-campus, which attracts a different kind of attention. For the most part, I get stares with the occasional yet uncomfortable “thank you for your service.” About once a month you’ll encounter the typical eccentric conspiracy theorist who opposes anything in uniform. For reasons unbeknownst to me, they commonly view cadets as some sort of brainwashed legion of minions ready to serve America’s Illuminati masters at a second’s notice. Personally, I don’t mind the slightly eccentric critics; if anything, they provide me with great conversation material to work with.
However, I’m bothered when I’m asked why I joined the Army. It’s not that I dislike the question itself or the strangers who ask. On the contrary, I want to answer their questions. I just struggle to find the words to answer such a complicated question at a moment’s notice. Thus, I’m stuck giving them a cliché answer, disappointing them as well as myself. If time allowed, I’d give them two answers.
The first addresses why I joined. From a young age, I dreamed of changing the front lines of American foreign policy. Thus, the military naturally attracted my attention. The second part of my answer addresses the more important, hidden question: why I decide to stay. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’ve had plenty of moments where I’ve asked myself what the hell I’m doing as I struggle to find my PT belt at 0530. However, it’s the motivation of others that convinced me to stay. You see, at Harvard, people often let you face things alone. Everyone’s competing to be the best, and in doing so, many hold so-called “stragglers” in contempt.
Our cadets don’t operate like that. Whether a cadet’s struggling to finish a lap, climb an obstacle, or continue the ruck march, you can bet your life that they’ve got four other cadets running alongside them, encouraging them to keep pushing. You never crawl alone. You never run alone. You never fight alone. It doesn’t matter what you believe, where you’re from, or what you know. All that matters is that you’re wearing the same uniform as the person beside you.
That’s why I’ll keep wearing this camouflage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
The latest “Pop a Molly” column urges readers to “think harder” about “hot-button topics” like the House Master title change, yet it fails to do so in its own pronouncement of the controversy as “silly.”
While the author criticizes the “dishonest” practice of renaming for its selective remembering, she advocates for a selective remembering that prioritizes the images of slave-owners and perpetrators of violence. She claims that it is “dangerous to pick and choose what parts of our history we want to remember,” then defends the selective memorializing—and inherent honoring—of Confederate soldiers and Christopher Columbus. Do these forms of memorial not serve to honor those who have done great harm?
Instead, as a means of preserving the past, why not rename buildings after former slaves or historical figures who have fought for justice? Is this not a way to critique and remember the harm done by slave owners and colonizers while also uplifting subjugated narratives?
As the author claims that there is little benefit or cost in changing the House Master title, I wonder if she has taken the time to consider the experience of black students on this campus. As a writer who has not taken the time to “think harder” about Harvard’s racist legacies in her own column, what right does she have to critique our apparently selective remembering?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The votes are in, and the school that Richard Nixon once called the “Kremlin on the Charles” is ready for Hillary.
Recent numbers published by The Crimson show that 91 percent of campaign contributions in the current election cycle from Harvard faculty have gone to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This data merely continues a trend: between 2011 and the third quarter of 2014, 84 percent of such donations went to Democrats.
We should first be clear that these numbers are not indicative of the entire faculty's ideological tilt. Only 81 faculty members have donated so far in this cycle, and the numbers released only show contributions in 2015. Given the scale of the Harvard faculty which boasts more than 2,400 individuals, the donations of three percent should not imply that 91 percent of all professors, lecturers, and researchers support Clinton. In this election cycle in particular, support for a Democratic candidate might not always predict party affiliation: after all, a recent poll indicated that 20 percent of Democrats might vote for Republican businessman Donald Trump.
Still, a trend is visible. Even if it isn’t 91 percent or even 84 percent, we should state the obvious: Harvard’s faculty leans left. In a nation that is reasonably divided between conservatives and liberals, 02138 is almost certainly more liberal than the average zip code. At a university that prides itself on the depth of its thought and the diversity of its population, that is a problem.
On this campus, issues of diversity and underrepresentation are rightly at the forefront.  Whether over the racial challenges that Harvard schools still face, socioeconomic issues that impede access to higher education, or the hugely important gender- and sexuality-based obstacles that exist, we must continue to commit ourselves to opening our doors still wider. In short, we should value diversity in all its forms.
Tearing down obstacles and righting wrongs should be part of our basic humanity, but the role of diversity is not solely humanitarian. Part of Harvard College’s goal of providing a transformational experience necessitates the broadening of viewpoints that only can occur when students can interact with others of different backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs.
To be clear, racial minorities, women, and Republicans have not had the same experience in this country. We have had one black president, no female presidents, and 18 Republicans. Conservatives have not traditionally experienced societal exclusion, been treated as second-class citizens, or felt excluded from the national conversation. Yet if we are genuinely to be committed to an education that broadens perspectives, our campus is poorer for its lack of ideological diversity.
In a country split roughly 50/50 between the parties, students should be exposed to both conservative and liberal positions. When the faculty is so deeply ideologically homogenous, at least in the general direction of their beliefs, this is more difficult. A political science or economics course is made less rich when no one is willing to speak up to defend half of the country.
Unfortunately, we fear that the perception of bias is sufficient to suppress conservative viewpoints. Regardless of whether the teaching staff shows any partisan proclivities in their grading—and we do not suspect they often do—the presence of a liberal professor and TF combined with a classroom full of generally liberal peers might be sufficient to keep a conservative student from speaking up in section. Thus, these campaign contributions numbers alone should worry us.
There are no easy solutions here, just as there are no easy solutions to any of Harvard’s diversity issues. Yet there are tangible steps to be taken. Professors should refrain from unnecessary digs at Republicans and encourage conservative viewpoints in their classroom discussions. Teaching fellows should lead sections that seek to explore both sides of partisan issues, and avoid demonizing all conservatives with a broad brush. Students, for their part, should speak their mind and be willing to listen to conservative perspectives with which they do not agree. Ultimately, this strengthens all of our educations, making us better students and better citizens.
In short, the Kremlin on the Charles could use a little bit of glasnost and perestroika.

Most of us have a friend who’s an open book—that one person who accidentally spills out a four-sentence response to, “How are you?” and catches you off-guard as you’re trying to walk down the crowded Science Center stairs, get in line for curly fries at lunch, or brush your teeth and get to bed. For a handful of people at Harvard, that friend is... me. As many West-Coast bros, New Yorkers and others may expect of their token Midwestern friend, I’m a lot more invested in small talk than many Harvard students—maybe blame it on my upbringing in the land of “Minnesota Nice.”
When small talk grows bigger and gets personal, though, it can get weird. In the past year, I’ve opened some floodgates and had conversations with many people about my experiences with depression and other mental health issues. Most of my friends, peers, coaches, andteachers have been incredibly supportive and understanding. I am very blessed to have never had a person say they don’t believe me when I say I’m not able to complete a task because of depression-related symptoms or frequent doctors’ appointments. However, sometimes an unexpected third party joins the conversation between a friend or acquaintance and me. People say, “Yeah, college sucks,” or “Yeah, Harvard sucks.” I’m always caught off-guard, and, frankly, a little offended. Here, let me explain:
Are there systemic issues with Harvard? Oh, absolutely. Let’s not even get started about the problems faced by students due to race, gender, physical disability, religious beliefs, politics, personal finances, or family educational backgrounds. I am not here to speak personally for these individuals because they speak best for themselves. As a white, straight, physically able daughter of two college grads, I can speak to my (straight, white) womanhood and my mental health issues, and on every other front I’m here only to listen and support as best as I can.
However, it’s funny to me when people conversationally draw a causal link between my mental health issues and Harvard. Have I ever wondered if I’d be happier elsewhere? Oh, absolutely. I assume we all have, regardless of where we go to school. However, let’s not undercut the fact that mental illness is not an attitude problem: It is a medical condition. After years of trying to “work on my attitude,” I saw a registered nurse who prescribed a generic form of Prozac to me and upped my dosage until it finally worked. Since it took several tries to get the dosage right, we know this pill is a chemical aid to my brain and not a placebo. My medication is a selective serotonin reuptake drug (an SSRI), and it changed the entire way I perceive myself. I am not a negative person. I have a disorder in my brain that keeps it from utilizing all of its “happiness chemicals:” Its serotonin.
Once I started the right dosage of medication, so many things started changing for the better. It began with an increase in physical energy: It felt as if I’d been on the verge of a cold for several months and suddenly had the clear head and awakeness of someone who is well. Thoughts of self-anger and self-harm were largely replaced by an ability to focus on my studies. My fear of talking to friends and peers decreased. I’m not saying pills are the only way to “solve” a mental health disorder— I have friends who find therapy, counseling groups, mindfulness, breathing exercises, or other non-pill-shaped methods just as effective. And I should never forget that medication is only an option to me because I am lucky enough to have health insurance. What I’m trying to say here is, college has been tough at times, but blaming this on Harvard is greatly reductive to my personal health and resilience (and, yeah, also reductive to college itself).
The biggest change I’ve noticed since meds is my increased ability to show that I’m grateful for things—I have the energy to hang out with a friend, stop by a professor’s office hours after a good lecture, drop an email to my parents, or go for a run and fully clear my head, or just think about how good the air smells. Are there frustrating parts of college? Are there frustrating parts of Harvard? Oh, absolutely. But I’m here for four more months, and I’m going to soak up and spread every bit of goodness that I can.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a high of 55 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, Cambridge experienced unusually frigid temperatures as low as -8 degrees Fahrenheit last weekend, leading many students to adjust their daily routines.
To combat the extreme cold, many students reported wearing several layers and even avoiding the outdoors if possible.
“I wore two pairs of mittens,” Vanessa H. Boyle ’19 said. “I wore two jackets: a smaller jacket and a larger jacket. I wore Doc Martens. They were the warmest shoes I had.”
In preparation for the abnormal weather, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and several House Deans advised students via email of precautionary measures and potential impacts related to the extreme cold and windchill.
“Please keep windows closed, dress warmly,” Leverett House Dean Bilal A. Malik wrote. “And consider using the shuttle.”
Many students heeded the advice, opting to stay indoors even if it meant skipping meals in the dining halls.
“I stayed home,” Karla V. Alvarado ’19 said. “I ate in my dorm. I don’t think I went to the dining hall.”
According to AccuWeather forecasting service, last weekend in February historically averages a high of 38 and a low of 24 degrees Fahrenheit. The subzero temperatures were shocking, then, even to some East Coast natives.
“Even though I’m from New York, and it sometimes gets that cold, I could forget that weather like that is real. And it came out of nowhere,” Jason A. Mills ’17 said.
Jonathan K. Kosgei ’19, a native of Kenya, expressed similar astonishment that a New England winter could be so bitingly cold.
“My face was almost frozen after the first three seconds I went out. I have never been that cold,” Kosgei said.
Still, some students expressed less aversion to the freezing temperatures and even developed effective coping mechanisms to take a more positive outlook towards the extreme weather.
“If you tell yourself that it’s not cold, then it’s not cold. If that’s your perception, your body doesn’t feel as cold,” Pablo A. Reimers ’19 said.
The contrast between Tuesday’s warm weather and the frigid temperatures of the holiday weekend even delighted some students.
“It felt like summer was here. It was so warm. I knew this is New England, and things could change really fast,” Kosgei said.

With the increasing popularity of Harvard summer study abroad programs, some students have expressed concerns regarding the process by which financial aid funds are awarded, arguing that funding may not go to students who most need it.
The most prevalent form of summer funding is provided by the Office of Career Services—which uses a lottery-based process with a preference towards juniors who have not received prior funding—to select gift recipients for Harvard-sponsored study abroad programs.
OCS does not consider a student’s degree of financial need when awarding such gifts, according to OCS director Robin Mount. Students who are not on financial aid can receive $1,500 awards, while OCS awards for students on financial aid can cover the program’s cost and airfare, according to the OCS’ website.
Mount said the office uses a lottery process for several reasons. OCS does not have sufficient funds to offer financial aid to all study abroad applicants and all OCS funds are sourced from donors, some of whom have specific academic concentration or residential house constraints, she said.
Additionally, awarding study abroad gifts based on need could automatically label recipients as financial aid students, Mount said. “Not everybody wants others to know that they are on financial aid,” she said.
For some students who apply to secure funding, the results of the lottery can serve as an influential factor in the decision over whether to participate in certain programs.
“I definitely won’t go if I don’t get funding,” said Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, who is still awaiting notification of her funding award. Madhavi L. Narayanan ’17, who has studied abroad in the past said she would not have traveled abroad if she had not received funding.
OCS plans to release all funding awards by March, according to the office’s website.
According to Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, waiting for the March funding decision can be stressful for some students who rely on financial aid. Some apply for several other programs as backup plans in case they do not receive funding.
“It’s frustrating not to have control,” Goldberg said.
Some students argued that the OCS funding award process should consider financial need. Narayanan stressed the importance of striking a balance between need and student desire.
“I think both the need and the desire [to travel] are important,” Narayanan said.
Other students said they were not disheartened by the process. Award preference is given to college juniors, meaning that underclassman have a greater chance at receiving funding in the future, Mount said.
“There is a 50 percent chance of receiving funding. It’s not that bad,” Goldberg said. “It’s difficult to have criteria for what makes a person most qualified for funding.”
Other undergraduates praised the OCS funding program, which could potentially cover both tuition and airfare.
Vasquez-Rodriguez said the OCS funding she received was extremely generous.
“When we know that the school has so much money, it’s easy to be like ‘Why can’t they spare a few extra thousand dollars for me?’ But I think it’s important to realize that this is somebody else’s money,” Narayanan said.

The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia could affect the Court’s upcoming decision in Fisher v. Texas, an affirmative action case that experts say may change the admissions processes of universities including Harvard.
In 2013, the Supreme Court first heard Fisher v. Texas, a case that involves a white woman who, after being denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin, filed a lawsuit against the school alleging that the university discriminated against her because of her race. The Supreme Court initially ruled that a lower court made a procedural misstep, and eventually a circuit court ruled in favor of the University of Texas. Plaintiff Abigail N. Fisher later appealed that ruling, and the Supreme Court is currently re-hearing the case.
Meanwhile, Harvard is engaged in a lawsuit accusing the University of discriminating against Asian American applicants through its use of race-based affirmative action. That suit is on hold pending results of the Fisher case. Both Harvard University and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow have filed amicus briefs to the case supporting affirmative action, and University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly pledged a “vigorous defense” of the policy in admissions.
The Fisher case, which involves a public institution, may not directly impact Harvard’s admissions practices. But, some experts say, it remains possible that the Court’s ultimate decision could affect Harvard and peer institutions because of Title VI—legislation requiring institutions that accept federal funding to follow government guidelines on matters of civil rights.
Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 declined to comment on the case through a spokesperson.
Another disruption in the Fisher case’s proceedings could affect the Supreme Court’s eventual ruling. The absence of Scalia’s conservative voice casts a particularly large shadow on the case because the Supreme Court justices’ opinions on affirmative action are “rather evenly divided,” according to Kerry B. Melear, an associate  professor of higher education at the University of Mississippi.
The Court will now make its decision—expected by the end of June—based on the votes of only seven justices, rather than the usual nine. Justice Elena Kagan, a former Dean of Harvard Law School, recused herself because she worked on the case during her tenure as U.S. Solicitor General.
“It’s still possible with only seven justices participating that what’s happening in Texas could be struck down,” Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law, said.
Scalia was “one of the strongest voices on the Court opposing race-conscious admissions,” Lake added. Commentators criticized Scalia for a December statement suggesting that some African-American students did not belong at elite universities.
Without Scalia’s reliably conservative presence in the Court, the Fisher decision could be even more closely contested.
Lake said the remaining members of the Court are now widely perceived as split, with three liberal and three conservative justices and one “swing vote,” held by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
Edward Blum, who led Fisher’s initial case against the University of Texas and is now spearheading the lawsuit against Harvard, also said the case is noteworthy because of the difference of opinion between the justices.
“The Fisher case is one of the few high-profile cases in which a majority [of the Justices] could exist to either uphold the University of Texas’ policies or strike them down,” Blum said, adding he hoped the Supreme Court would strike down affirmative action at the University of Texas.
The court’s decision in the Fisher case could also nullify Blum’s lawsuit entirely if the interpretation of Title VI ultimately ends the consideration of race in admissions at private colleges as well as public.
“What happens in the litigation in Fisher will be something of interest and importance for private colleges as well,” Neal H. Hutchens, an associate professor of education at Pennsylvania State University, said. “The direct holding would be in relation to public colleges, but depending on the language in the ruling, that is certainly going to be looked at in terms... of Title VI.”
Hutchens added that if the Supreme Court decides to prohibit the use of race-based affirmative action at colleges, more court battles would likely follow.
Lake expressed concern about the possibility that the Supreme Court’s decision on Fisher could bring further confusion and litigation about admissions processes.
“Higher education deserves a clearer answer, one way or the other,” Lake said. “It isn’t functional for so many American young people to sit back and wonder, ‘What’s the standard by which I’m going to be admitted to college?’”

Sam Feist, CNN’s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, defended the state of mainstream media and coverage of the current presidential election at the Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday.
At the event, which was organized by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, Feist described the American public’s growing interest in political news, and stressed the importance of maintaining neutrality in the media’s coverage of the presidential election.
“Our job is to put as much information out there as we possibly can, and let the voters decide what they want to do with it,” he said.
Feist added that there has been a “remarkable” increase in the number of viewers of the presidential debates. During the 2012 election, 7.6 million viewers tuned into the Republican presidential primary debate on ABC, while a record 23.9 million watched the debate on Fox in 2015.
“There’s something happening out in the public,” he said. “A fascination with this campaign, an interest in the candidates, and that’s a great thing.”
According to Feist, CNN made a strategic decision to invest significant resources into its political coverage in order to meet the increasing demand. To that end, the organization hired 45 new employees to cover the current election.
Feist said he hopes increased public interest in the election, which may be a result of the public’s “dissatisfaction with Washington,” will translate into a greater voter turnout.
When asked by an audience member about the relatively heavy coverage of Donald J. Trump’s campaign, Feist said Trump is more responsive to the media than most other candidates.
“There’s something interesting about Donald Trump that I have never seen,” he said. “This is my seventh Presidential election. When it comes to interviews, Donald Trump says yes. And that is unique.”
Feist said that even though journalists are currently “not terribly popular” in America, they conduct their reporting with a “remarkable level of integrity.”
“In 25 years at CNN, I have never once heard a colleague describe or even suggest whom they’re voting for,” he said. “And that’s a good thing.”
Michaela B. Morrow ’18, an audience member, said she appreciated the chance to hear from an insider of the media industry.
“I think it’s a really unique opportunity,” she said. “After class, you can come and hear from the person in charge of CNN’s coverage of the election. It’s neat to get the behind-the-scenes perspective.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indigo, a new peer counseling group that will specifically address issues of race and class in mental health, is set to commence operations next Saturday.
The organization’s formation was the result of an effort between undergraduates and Harvard University Health Services administrators to bolster targeted counseling for marginalized students and around issues of diversity.
Indigo will begin staffing drop-in hours Saturday and Sunday nights from 9 p.m. to midnight in  an Adams House common space located in the basement of H Entryway.
The idea for the new counseling service stemmed from a June meeting between Henri C. Garrison ’16 and HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira. Garrison said they approached Barreira to bring up a concern over diversity in counselors staffing mental health services. In the course of conversation, Barreira suggested the creation of a student task force to address race and class issues in counseling, which ultimately resulted in the founding of Indigo.
According to Barreira, Indigo is designed to serve any student who feels uncomfortable seeking mental health services due to perceived barriers such as race, religion, or socioeconomic status.
“To me, the really exciting part of that conversation was, okay, so anyone could staff it, not just students of color, and any student who identified that they feel marginalized for a variety of reasons might get helped there,” Barreira said.
Indigo, along with several other undergraduate peer counseling groups, wrapped up training for its new counselors in the first weeks of this semester. According to Garrison, Indigo trained its counselors to view race and class holistically and used workshops to address the concerns of international, first generation, and undocumented students.
The creation of Indigo comes amid a heightened campus discussion over the role of diversity in mental health counseling. Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 campaigned this fall on a platform that included a focus on increasing the racial diversity of mental health counselors.
Patrick Y. Xu ’16, a co-leader of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Mental Health Task Force, stressed the importance of counselors understanding the cultural background of students facing mental health issues.
“I think having people who understand your background, understand the cultural context you might be coming from is huge,” Xu said, specifically referring to an increased understanding between a counselor and a student seeking help.
The creation of Indigo comes alongside other recent changes to the peer counseling services currently offered. Another new peer counseling initiative, QuadTalk, a nightly peer counseling service for upperclassmen in the Radcliffe Quad, has also commenced operating this semester. Though Indigo is not one of the organizations currently staffing QuadTalk, Garrison said it was possible the group would join the effort in future semesters.
“That’s really contingent on the staff size, because we are super small this semester,” Garrison said. “It’ll kind of come down to once we do interviews again at the end of this semester, to see what size staff we get for next fall.”
Counseling and Mental Health Services Chief Barbara Lewis said appointing Stephanie Black, a HUHS mental health counselor, as an adviser to Indigo is part of an effort to familiarize students with HUHS staff.
“CAMHS is involved in supervision of the peer counseling groups, so my hope was that in having one of our counselors co-supervise the group, it would also make it more comfortable for the students who seek those services to also seek our services,” Lewis said.
Garrison said that although Indigo’s training focused primarily on issues of race and class, the group is capable of counseling on a variety of issues.
“We’re open to really everything,” Garrison said. "We’re happy to talk about that p-set too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshmen came back from winter break to discover that Annenberg Hall had a few new additions to its late-night snack service for students—namely, expanded hot meal options and later closing times.
The service, called "brain break," had already been around for some time but has gone long without significant changes or improvement. Recent changes spurred by the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Undergraduate Council expanded the program’s offerings offered to freshmen.
The change expands the hours of brain break, which had originally been from 9:15 to 10:45 p.m., to from 9:15 to 11:30 p.m.
“We wanted students to get more sustenance from their food and spend more time with their classmates,” said UC Freshman Representative Jack K. Kelley ’19.
The program has also expanded its food offerings, according to Torey E. Martin, an administrator at the Freshman Dean’s Office. Fresh fruit and other cold options are available on Tuesday nights, while hot options—such as pancakes, waffles, grilled cheese, and chicken fingers—are available on Thursday nights.
“Before the offerings were very limited and people weren’t turning out in great numbers; now there’s more interest in students that have gone and expressed real appreciation,” Interim Dean of Student Life and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
Some UC representatives argued that the hourly changes will better resemble a late-night culture of dining halls in the Houses.
“Upperclassmen have their dining halls open to them, stocked with food, later at night. If we were to bring more food to freshman brain break, it would be opening up opportunities similar to those at upperclassmen houses.” said UC Freshman Representative Scott Xiao ‘19.
Overall, the administrators hope the changes to Brain Break will expand the role of Annenberg as not only a freshman dining hall, but also a space to decompress, Martin said.
“I hope that students will see it as an opportunity to take a break from studying, have space to be with their classmates, and take a breather to get out of their dorms,” Martin said. “It’s important for all aspects of your first year for students to take a pause.”
Many students welcomed the new changes, particularly the introduction of more food offerings. Others enjoyed the concept of later open times, which resonated more closely with their day schedules.
“Any hot food is always good,” Thomas A. Lee ’19 said. “Especially because I feel like with a busy schedule it’s a two meal day and brain break adds another option for more food.”
Enhanced options form part of a larger push from the Freshman Dean’s Office to increase programming opportunities for freshmen to expand social networks, according to Dingman.
“If a lot of people are coming to Brain Break, hanging out, and getting food, it helps to create a cohesive freshman class. That was a huge motivation for HUDS and FDO to support us in this mission.” said UC Freshman Representative Catherine L. Zhang ’19.

Jocelyne Cesari, a visiting professor of Religion and Politics at the Harvard Divinity School, discussed the politicization of Islam by the Islamic State at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies Tuesday evening.
Cesari examined the type of Islam to which the Islamic State, a jihadist group that has carried out multiple terrorist attacks, subscribes. Cesari pointed out differences between traditional Islam and what she said was a modern, politicized version of the religion, which resistance movements have increasingly used.
Rather than trying to determine the exact relationship between modern extremist groups and Islam, Cesari said she prefers to focus on the “genealogy of their justification.” The incidents of terrorism today do not fit into the definition of the “classical jihad,” which emphasized a “communal and collective effort,” she said.
“We have to address the condition of modernized Islam and look at it as a politicized narrative,” she said. “Looking back at classical Islam is interesting, but it doesn’t allow us to make the connection with the current discourse if we bypass almost a century.”
Cesari traced the growth of the modern version of Islam to the decline of classical Islam, which she said few outside of academia are still interested in studying.
Cesari said her interest in Islam stemmed from her training as a political scientist in France, where she was inspired by her professors who studied former French colonies. Her current research focuses on the intersection between religion and politics.
“My goal is really to de-ghettoize Islamic studies and make more and more comparisons with other religions and how they have become politicized at some moments,” Cesari said.
Deniz Cakirer, a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies who studies political Islam in Turkey, said she has been following Cesari’s research for a long time and found the talk “very interesting.”
“It’s very close to my own research area,” she said. “It was great to actually see her in person and listen to her.”
One audience member, Nayera A. El-Sawah, an intern at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said she also found the session informative.
“I feel like part of what allows for these conflicts to exist is the ignorance on certain topics and the silencing of discussion on certain things,” she said. “I’m happy to see this sort of discourse happening in an academic setting.”

Members of anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better outlined their goals for the semester, saying they will focus on implementing a recently-approved referendum that asks Harvard administrators to open sexual assault task forces to all interested students.
At an off-the-record meeting Tuesday evening, organizers of the group—who have criticized the University’s response to campus sexual assault—discussed the organization’s prior advocacy work and encouraged new members to join the group, according to Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer of the group. 
Fournier said the group primarily plans to focus on implementing a referendum from last election's Undergraduate Council ballot, which asked whether Harvard should make open to all students task forces analyzing sexual assault policy. About 76 percent of voters expressed approval of the referendum, although not enough undergraduates voted in the election for the measure to become the UC’s official stance.
Fournier said organizers will push for administrators to invite  more undergraduates to task forces that review Harvard’s Title IX policies—a move that would be a direct response to the referendum. Some task forces, including one focused on sexual assault prevention, contain undergraduates. Still, some students, including Julia R. Geiger ’16 and organizers of Our Harvard Can Do Better criticized the University last semester for what they said was a lack of student input in Title IX policy changes.
“I think our focus is more focused and targeted on policy and activism around administrative response,” Fournier said. “[We] see our role as a voice outside of the administration, outside of Harvard, that is able to be critical of what the administration is doing and to push… a policy-oriented angle.”
Harvard has faced increased criticism in recent years as students host rallies and the federal government continues an investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance.  Fournier said investigators  from the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights have not recently provided updates on the investigation, which began in early 2014 after at least one undergraduate filed a federal complaint. Since the investigation’s inception, investigators have visited campus to interview undergraduates.
A sexual conduct climate survey, which showed that 31 percent of undergraduate senior women had experienced some form of sexual misconduct while enrolled at Harvard, drew powerful reactions from administrators last semester, who called the data “deeply distressing.”
Administrators on a University-wide task force also hope to release a report of recommendations on the prevention of sexual assault this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 17, 2016, at 9:43 p.m.
Student activists began to occupy a portion of Harvard Law School's Caspersen Student Center Monday evening in an effort to create a space on campus they say has been denied to minorities at the school. Calling the lounge “Belinda Hall” after a former slave of prominent Law School benefactors, the group of activists led by Reclaim Harvard Law said they plan to remain there indefinitely.
Last fall, Reclaim Harvard Law released a series of demands, calling on Law School administrators to create a critical race theory program, adjust the school’s curriculum, hire more diverse faculty, and change the school’s controversial seal featuring the shield of the Royall family, who owned slaves—including Belinda.
In late November, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow appointed a committee to reconsider the seal, and administrators have said they will continue to work on hiring more diverse faculty members and improving orientation programming for incoming students.
Student activists, though, say they are unsatisfied with the Law School’s response. After a quiet period that lasted throughout winter break and the early weeks of the semester, activists are visibly resuming their efforts—which last semester culminated in a number of protests.
Citing sit-ins by protesters at the University of Cape Town and several American universities as inspiration, third-year Law student Rena T. Karefa-Johnson said activists decided to occupy the major campus thoroughfare in order to take ownership of a physical space, which they say minority groups at the Law School lack.
“This is about working with each other to implement and build out the things that we can do,” Karefa-Johnson said. “This can be an Office of Diversity, this can be a critical race theory classroom.”
Equipped with blow-up mattresses, blankets, and suitcases, the activists have moved into the hall.
On Tuesday afternoon, students drank coffee and talked about diversity and inclusion as Nina Simone’s “Feeling Good” played softly in the background. Signs mounted on the walls read “Come talk to us, we don’t bite,” “Critical race theory,” and “Office of Diversity and Inclusion.”
About 20 students stayed overnight on Monday—the first evening of the sit-in— according to Law student Isaac Cameron, who said he expects turnout to increase in the coming days. In the daytime, students are manning various stations intended to inform curious passersby of the group’s mission. Shay N. Johnson, one of the internal vice-presidents of the Black Law Students Association, manned one such station, called “Reclaim Harvard Law Fireside Chat.”
“We want people to feel comfortable to come and discuss tough topics around diversity and inclusion,” Johnson said while sitting by the fire.
Much of the occupation focuses on activists’ call for the Law School to reframe its curriculum to better integrate consideration of race into the study of law. Karefa-Johnson said she thinks the Law School’s current curriculum often approaches law as if it were created in a vacuum without regard to its implications for minorities.
As part of the occupation, clinical professors held a workshop Tuesday afternoon about contextualizing the Law School’s curriculum. Students and faculty discussed how professors should address race in their classes, and Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells came to observe. Reclaim Harvard Law is planning similar programs throughout the duration of their occupation.
Activists said they are drawing on an extensive history of activism at the Law School and current movements around the globe to inform and promote their own cause.
“Our recent efforts are intellectually descended from the numerous student movements that have arisen time and again at HLS,” members of Reclaim Harvard Law wrote in a press release Tuesday.
Karefa-Johnson said that Law School activists today aim to broaden the scope of their efforts. “This is about HLS, but it’s also about inequality in America,” she said.
Students from Brandeis University, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Boston Latin High School have protested alongside Reclaim Harvard Law, members of the group said.
The occupation has no pre-determined endpoint, and activists say they will remain in the hall indefinitely.
“I’ll stay as long as necessary,” Cameron said.

This article has been updated to reflect the following clarification: 
CLARIFICATION: February 17, 2016
A previous version and headline of this article referred to the location of the Law School activists' occupation as Wasserstein Hall. In fact, they occupied a portion of the Caspersen Student Center, which is located in the same facility as Wasserstein Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Don’t look now, but Friday night is shaping up to be Hockey Night in Cambridge.
That means the Bright-Landry Hockey Center—yes, the Bright-Landry Hockey Center—is going to be packed. Not Alumni Night packed. Not the Athletic Department bribing students with free pizza packed. Real packed.
For the first time in quite a while, the No. 13/13 Harvard men’s hockey team (14-8-3, 10-5-3 ECAC) has something legitimate, something big, to play for in front of a home crowd—an Ivy League championship.
But to do that—to end a 10-year Ancient Eight title drought—the Crimson will have to find a way to end a different drought. Harvard needs to beat rival Cornell, whom it has not beaten at home in over seven years.
Yet, while all seven of those games were played at the Bright, the Crimson could hardly call them home games. Every time these two teams square off in Cambridge, Big Red Nation travels in numbers, as there’s no way an eastward drive of 300-plus miles can prevent Ithacans from missing out on an edition of one of college hockey’s greatest rivalries.
Friday should be no different. In fact, at least a third of the Bright Center is bound to be a sea of red prior to puck drop. Nonetheless, the hosts might actually feel like hosts this time around. Thanks to rising fan support, attendance at the Bright has risen by over 16 percent this year; and with something actually at stake on Friday, there’s a legitimate chance this game could be sold out by the time this paper hits the stands.
But I’ve dwelled enough over the years on the people that fill (and don’t fill) the Bright. At the end of the day, Coach Ted Donato ’91 could probably care less about who the Crimson has in its corner on Friday, so long as Harvard can get a result.
Nonetheless, there is more than enough reason to doubt whether the Crimson can actually attain that result. Not because Cornell has had Harvard’s number over the past few years—the Crimson put that notion to rest last month when it ran away with a 6-2 decision at Lynah Rink—but because this season, Harvard has consistently found a way to come up short in big games.
While the Crimson has cleaned up against teams at .500 or below, posting a 9-2-1 record in those games, Harvard has gone just 5-6-2 against teams with winning records. And to be frank, that mark feels a bit inflated, considering that the Crimson’s latest win over Union, who boasts a 4-9-5 record in the ECAC, technically counts given the Dutchmen’ early out-of-conference success.
Among Harvard’s lowlights this season: falling twice to No. 1/1 Quinnipiac, throwing away a two-goal lead in the final minutes of a home bout with No. 9/9 Boston University, and coming up short at yet another Beanpot—one many believed the Crimson had its best shot in years at winning.
More recently, Harvard had an opportunity to wrap up the Ivy League title in New Haven, where it has not won a regular season game in over a decade, and again, the Crimson fell short.
All this being said, it would be unfair to judge a team solely on games like these. Quinnipiac, BU, Boston College, and Yale are all ranked among the top 10 teams in the nation. Good luck winning every single one of those games.
But to lose all of them? That’s a tough pill to swallow. With as talented an array of forwards as Harvard has, the Crimson remains a legitimate contender for a national title, but as the old adage goes, to be the best, you’ve got to beat the best. And that simply has not happened for this Harvard team.
In fact, the Crimson has accumulated seven of its eight losses since the turn of the calendar year, largely because opponents have discovered ways to expose Harvard’s defensive unit.
But the Crimson’s problems do not end at the blue line. Harvard’s surprise of the season in the fall—sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen—like many of the men around him has also come crashing back down to earth.
After opening the season 7-0-2, even receiving a nomination for the Hobey Baker award given to college hockey’s Most Valuable Player, Madsen has struggled as of late. Rebound control has been a problem, his glove has failed him on multiple occasions, and the defense around him has not been playing at a high enough level to mask his mistakes.
But just as the wheels were beginning to fall off, the Crimson defense had its best showing in weeks over the weekend, giving Harvard’s starting netminder the confidence to stop 24 of 25 shots in a win over Union that snapped a three-game Crimson skid.
Tougher competition is on the way, however. While Harvard won’t run into any more powerhouses for the rest of the regular season, the Crimson will have to fend off three teams above .500 in its final four games, beginning with No. 16/- Cornell on Friday.
Despite all my skepticism, I’m picking Harvard. Big wins have eluded this team, but I believe last weekend provided the Crimson with the jolt it needs to start trending upward once again.
But if I’m wrong, and Harvard fumbles away not only an Ivy League title but also its hold on a potential first-round bye in the ECAC tournament, it’s possible Friday could spell the beginning of the end for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Defense wins championships. It’s pretty undisputed.
Harvard women’s water polo coach Ted Minnis is justified, then, in placing a heavy emphasis on defensive tactics, schemes, and awareness during practice. This mantra has translated into an 8-1 start, the best record that a Crimson women’s water polo team has garnered through nine games in over 20 years. His players know that a defensive shutout is every bit as valuable—if not more so—than an offensive onslaught.
Ultimately, however, the success of a defense comes down to whether or not the ball passes between the goalposts and under the crossbar.
Sophomore goalkeeper Cleo Harrington, The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week, has played an instrumental role all season long in helping Harvard to its fast start, turning away shot after shot and anchoring a defense that has limited its opponents to single-digit scoring in all but two contests.
On the season, Harrington has recorded 69 saves in six starts, posted a record of 5-1, and assisted four times over that stretch.
“I think we’ve found a system that really works,” Harrington said. “We’re learning to trust each other, and our communication has gotten a lot better. Putting all those things together has been a big part of [our defensive success].”
At the recent Princeton Invitational at DeNunzio Pool, Harrington recorded 12 stops in goal against No. 23 California Baptist on Saturday morning, then 10 more against No. 22 Wagner later that day. She was awarded with victories in both matches after Harvard scored clutch goals on the offensive end.
“[Coach Minnis] always stresses that defense wins games, and that’s really how we’re going to feed our offense,” Harrington said. “We’re just starting to realize how successful we can be.”
The low-scoring nature of the Crimson’s matches magnifies the spotlight placed on the goalies—and in these moments, Harrington has risen to the challenge.
Cal Baptist senior goalie Meghan Rowland was unable to match Harrington’s 12-for-16 (.750) save record in the tournament opener, tallying just six saves on 14 shot attempts (.429). Wagner junior goalie Emily Riddle fared similarly in the nightcap, stopping six attempts on 13 attempts (.462), compared to Harrington’s 10 saves on 16 shot attempts (.625). With game totals of 14 and 15 saves earlier in the season, Harrington has consistently performed a cut above the rest.
Her performance has enabled her teammates to trust her abilities to block shots, in turn allowing for a more pestering and efficient defensive setup, according to senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix. With Minnis constantly telling his players to press, this sort of trust is a necessity in the pool.
Harrington also attributes a portion of this year’s success to the experience she gained during her freshman season.
“Definitely getting a good amount of playing time last year taught me a lot,” Harrington said. “It definitely helped get all the jitters out freshman year and [helped me] learn our system of play, so that when I came in this year, the nerves weren’t there as much, and I was just excited to play.”
With the 2016 season about a third of the way done, Harrington is on track to obliterate the number of saves she made last year, her rookie year, when she posted 162 saves on the season while splitting time with now-graduated senior goalkeeper Ariel Dukes ’15. Harrington’s career high for single-game saves is 17, a mark she also set in 2015.
Now, as the starting goalkeeper, Harrington is expected to get the majority of starts over freshman backup goalie Sam Acker, who, in her own right, has gone undefeated in three starts and recorded 28 saves. The tandem projects to be a force in net for Harvard as they look to build on the team’s fast start.
“They are amazing,” Hendrix said. “It comes from both of them having the greatest work ethic. They block some incredible shots. We know that if Sam’s in goal, if Cleo’s in the goal, they have our back, and we can trust them. I love playing with them.”

We're not quite sure why, but Flyby writers seem to experience worse winter woes than the rest of campus. From Geoff's T Ride of Doom to Nacho's Quad Walk, this winter has been treating us particularly poorly. In our most recent installation of "I'm Cold and My Life Sucks," Caie makes the grave mistake of trying to go to class. 
Complaining about living in the Quad and having to deal with shuttle transportation during the winter is a pretty regular occurrence on Harvard’s campus, so much so that whining that Eliot and Winthrop are “actually pretty far away, I swear,” from the Science Center is normally quickly shut down. Yesterday morning, however, my morning journey from the faraway land of the River houses to the Yard resulted in an unforeseen danger Quadlings do not have to face: all of the sidewalks from the river to the entrance of the Yard were covered by a thick layer of ice.
Nacho wrote a couple days ago about his first good cry in a long time, and so here’s another tragic tale courtesy of El Nino. It was a pretty warm day, and much of the ice was dripping from the houses as I left Winthrop around 9 am. Immediately, I was greeted by a sight I didn’t expect: perhaps because of the major shift from deathly-cold to mildly balmy temperatures in the night, the sidewalks were covered with ice—the smooth, unfriendly kind of ice that is on fresh skating rinks (I’m not a STEM major, so who knows if this is how winter works). I should have known to give up on my education and return to the shelter of my asbesto-filled home. But I felt a deep sense of obligation, because the professor of my 300-person Gen Ed clearly cares deeply about me and I didn’t want to let him down.
So I set off on my journey, and nearly to the yard around the old Yenching (#rip), I stepped on a particularly slippery piece of ice and went down. It was the kind of fall that happens quite rarely, when you’re falling so quickly that it feels like the ground is coming up to meet you instead of vice versa. The ice made a nice, sharp cracking noise as I fell, a gentle reminder of the weight I’ve gained since coming to Harvard. Because I’m brilliant I also happened to be carrying a HUDS breakfast classic: a blueberry muffin paired with a full cup of coffee. As I fell, up went the coffee (and cream) and the blueberry muffin, right into the beautiful place that is most commonly referred to my face.
Standing up, my hair, sweatshirt, and face dripping in coffee and muffin crumbs, I heard a weak “oh, damn” from behind me, courtesy of the group of students rushing to their morning classes. As an added bonus, a nearby construction crew also got to witness, and snicker at, my fall.
So here’s a note for all Harvard students: if you’re wondering how to walk on ice, the answer is probably pretty simple—don’t.

For those of you who prefer to live within the comfort of Lamont or gave up on lotteries after you were rejected from all of your classes during shopping week, Conan O’Brien was on campus on Friday afternoon for a conversation with President Drew Faust in Sanders. During the hourlong conversation open to students who had won a lucky ticket, Conan revealed that he had never taken Ec10, the second-most popular class at Harvard and pride and joy of Professor Gregory Mankiw, who, coincidentally, is also the author of a reasonably priced textbook in the same field.
Conan explained, “That was a knowledge that I don’t have, and I’ve always regretted it… I wish I had taken that course.” Professor Mankiw was not present at the time as he is not expected to make his bimonthly appearance in Sanders for lecture for another couple of weeks. Yet he clearly got the memo, posting a note on his blog Saturday afternoon that warned students: “Don’t make this mistake.”
For the hundreds of lucky freshman currently enrolled in the course, feel blessed: even though you may never reach the level of success that Conan has enjoyed, you will leave Harvard with an understanding of a market economy (or at least, an understanding that you do not have an understanding of a market economy thanks to a less-than-great TF) —and really, what’s better than that?
