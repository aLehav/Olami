After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Toward the beginning of Nikyatu Jusu’s debut feature “Nanny,” protagonist Aisha catches up with her friend who works at a New York City hair salon. Her fingers moving adeptly as she tirelessly braids hair, she says drily to Aisha, “Work until you die — the American dream, right?” In Jusu’s debut, Aisha (Anna Diop) is a Senegalese immigrant hired as a nanny for an affluent Manhattan couple; she sends money home to Senegal in the hopes that her six-year-old son Lamine will soon join her in America. Not long after accepting this new job, however, Aisha is plagued by increasingly chilling supernatural experiences. With Diop’s sensitive and brooding performance at the forefront of this colorful, dreamlike psychological thriller, Jusu offers a stirring elucidation of the dark realities of the American dream.
Aisha is hired by Amy (Michelle Monaghan) and Adam (Morgan Spector), a privileged yet dysfunctional couple living in a tastefully decorated apartment with their adorable daughter Rose. At the start of the film, a friend of Aisha warns her not to take this job for granted; positions like this can be hard to come by, especially since she’s undocumented. But Aisha quickly finds herself mistreated by her employers. While she forms a bond with Rose, Amy often neglects to pay her for her overtime hours, and Adam is passive and flirtatious. Jusu thoughtfully presents a frustrating truth: Women like Aisha work harder and longer than others, often just to be disparaged and exploited. Rather than be reduced to her hardships, however, Aisha is a refreshingly layered character. Diop imbues Aisha with a sense of warmth, evoking a discernible tenderness. Gentle but unafraid to stand up for herself, witty in her subtle humor, and caring in her relationships, she is ultimately complex and deeply sympathetic.
Unfortunately, Aisha’s problems don’t end with the exploitation she faces at work. Though she aches to reunite with her son and works to pool funds for his flight to America, she must settle for video calls that break up from poor connection and old videos of him on her phone. These simple yet heartbreaking moments underscore a glaring reality for Aisha and others like her: While she is taking care of someone else’s child in hopes of creating a better life for her family, someone else is taking care of her child, and she is missing out on the everyday moments of his life.
While working endless hours and yearning for her son, Aisha begins to experience the supernatural, which Jusu interweaves with compelling elements of West African magical realism. Her reflections in mirrors don’t align with her actions; she is haunted by water — rivers, pools, baths, showers, as if a single drop has the power to hurt her. Imaginative dream sequences capture a frightened Aisha submerged in water, her braids flowing angelically above her in a sea of deep blue. While scenes like these are both haunting and beautiful, they become slightly repetitive and slow down the pace of the story. “Nanny” may not be the most exciting psychological thriller ever made, but Diop still commands the screen even in its slower moments.
Though a more intense and varied buildup to the emotional climax of the film would have strengthened the narrative, Jusu’s feature debut is nevertheless engrossing in its combination of elements across a myriad of genres: psychological thriller, drama, and romance. Aisha’s budding relationship with the charismatic Malik (Sinqua Walls), the doorman at the apartment where she works, slowly unfolds into an endearing and sincere portrait of love. It is Malik’s grandmother, Kathleen (the venerable Leslie Uggams), who introduces Aisha to the West African folklore that seems to be connected to her supernatural experiences. When Aisha says she doesn’t believe in such things, Kathleen dismisses her: “You are magic,” she says, simply and with conviction.
“Nanny” is aesthetically beautiful, with a lush color palette and soft mood lighting grounding the film in a rich sensory world that serves to deepen the audience’s connection to Aisha’s story. There are also several moments of joy that provide respite from Aisha’s distress: a birthday party with other West African immigrants that brims with the sounds and colors of her home country, a nighttime car ride with Malik after their first date that evokes warmth and possibility. In presenting these ordinary joys alongside sinister phenomena, “Nanny” impressively portrays the many layers of Aisha’s world. By its unexpected ending, Jusu’s debut ultimately does a wonderful job of tying together its storylines to communicate an emotionally resonant message on privilege and the painful truths underpinning the ever-elusive American dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m an expert at working sideways. You need to be, when you’ve spent six months immobilized on your side swinging a Wii Remote.
Let me back up — I’m disabled. I’m a “Percy Jackson” addict, a language nerd, and a believer in vanilla ice cream, and I’m also disabled. Disability is not a monolith. The definition spans everything from depression to dyslexia, and no two people experience disability the same way, even if they have identical conditions.
But for myself, “I’m disabled” means Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, a rare neuromuscular developmental disorder that, among other effects, has made my muscles permanently contracted, has caused me to become legally blind, and has gifted me with a walker to glide down slopes with (zooming out the front entrance of the Science Center is always a highlight).
Yet equally, on reflection, it has given me a twofold perspective on life. It’s the perspective of someone who moves but cannot walk; looks but cannot see; talks but cannot be understood. It’s the story of someone born a stranger struggling to belong, at Harvard and in the wider world. And while I only speak for myself, one of the more than a billion disabled people globally, these are experiences that I know many others can relate to. The narratives of disabled people are too often absent from conversation, despite their intrinsic and intersectional importance — when’s the last time you heard disability mentioned as more than an afterthought? I only hope my individual story can begin to fill that gap.
When I was seven, I underwent major hip surgery that left me unable to sit or stand for six months. To keep me active during that time, my surgeon recommended that my parents buy a Nintendo Wii. Through my disability, I discovered video games.
And that they’re hard.
My first game, “Wii Sports,” was designed as a casual game for all audiences. Even still, as a complete novice to video games, developing the needed hand-eye coordination posed a challenge. Compounding my difficulty, however, was that I was lying on my side, viewing the TV at a 90-degree angle.
There’s a common-sense concept in video game design: The player should be challenged by the game’s intended obstacles, not by unintended complications. This principle is crucial for ensuring that games are fun and fair; the player should feel that their mistakes are their own. However, when I threw my bowling ball and it ended up flying backwards, hitting the audience behind my character, it wasn’t because of my lack of skill. It was because of my circumstances. I was lying on my side, playing in a way the game wasn’t meant to be played, and I was stuck in that position.
Living a disabled life means living life at a 90-degree angle, halfway in and halfway out, fighting the design of the world around me as much as the challenges placed in front of me. In my first semester at Harvard, I comped a service organization. I was excited, as first-years are — until I learned that you were only allowed to do the work in an inaccessible location. I requested a reasonable accommodation, but that conversation went nowhere. When I passed the comp, I was officially a member, yet all I could do was watch everyone else from the sidelines. My excitement vanished, replaced by a familiar dejection and the realization that Harvard was no different than anywhere else I’d known.
It doesn’t need to be that way; after all, our surrounding environment can change. In that same semester, I attended a course fair. I physically can’t raise my voice, and the room was so crowded that I couldn’t make myself heard. But instead of sending me away, the professor I was trying to talk with gave me her email and told me to contact her. And when I took her class, she offered to personally show me how to navigate the building. I felt like I belonged.
By every aspect of its marginalizing design, disabled people aren’t meant to exist in this world. Yet throughout this column, as I explore what makes me feel like I don’t belong in this world and what reassures me that I truly exist, I’m not asking for pity. In fact, I can hardly think of anything I want less (except rewatching the “Percy Jackson” movies, they’re awful). Instead, as I untangle my experiences of living a disabled life, I hope for discussion, for awareness of how our actions can impact the disabled people invisibly forced to the edges of our communities — and I hope that no matter how crowded of a room as Harvard is, my writing can speak louder than my weak voice, announcing, “We’re here.”
After all, I eventually learned how to bowl a strike, even while lying on my side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long before Allston-Brighton became nice, my best friends and I would take long walks around the neighborhood for fun. There was nowhere to go and not much to see except for the Tedeschi’s on the corner of Market and Faneuil and McKinney Field just a block and a half down the street. It became something of a tradition for us: Every day after school, we’d play two-hand-touch in our khaki pants and dress shoes, buy Little Debbie Honey Buns in obscene quantities, and roam around our simple, unpretentious neighborhood. Then came New Balance. And then the Lantera. The Aberdeen. The Saybrook. Harvard.
It’s no secret that Harvard’s property development is contributing to the rapid gentrification of Allston-Brighton. The University owns about one-third of Allston, which houses Harvard Business School, Harvard’s athletic facilities, and the new Science and Engineering Complex. Still pending state approval are the Enterprise Research Campus on Western Avenue and the development of the old Beacon Park Rail Yard by the Massachusetts Turnpike. Private developers, in anticipation of Harvard’s expansion into Allston-Brighton, have been eager to capitalize on what Boston officials say is the biggest building boom in the city’s history.
But what about the people who actually live here? While Boston officials and real estate developers are busy putting Allston-Brighton on the map, we have been struggling to pay rent in a time of pandemic and racial reckoning. Our diverse community, faced with mounting housing insecurity and social tension, has become a breeding ground for hate.
With land values increasing and new luxury apartment buildings popping up every few months, the average rent in Allston-Brighton for a non-luxury two-bedroom apartment has increased by more than 38 percent over the last five years, from $1,807 in 2016 to $2,500 in 2021. And as rent goes up, people get pushed out. It is no coincidence that Boston is ranked the third-most “intensely gentrified” city in the United States and that Massachusetts ranks first in the growth of family homelessness.
Consider, too, that Allston-Brighton’s population is made up of 30 percent people of color, with immigrants from every corner of the globe. These factors — combined with increased media coverage of anti-black police brutality in other major American cities and President Trump’s insinuations about China’s role in the Covid-19 pandemic — coincide with the City of Boston recording an all-time high of 355 hate incidents in 2020.
During the pandemic, my two best friends and I settled back into our old tradition of walking around the neighborhood after nearly five years of being too busy to hang out regularly. Only this time, there were a lot of places to go and a lot of things to see. At the top of our list were the new restaurants in Allston-Brighton, where everybody knows you can find the best Korean food in all of Boston. I remember waiting with my friends to pick up our takeout dinner from Coreanos, when a middle-aged white man, sitting on a nearby bench with tattered clothes and a knapsack, interrupted our conversation and asked, “Are you guys from China?” The only thing I could bring myself to say was no. It wasn’t a lie either — two of us were Filipino and the other was Chinese American, born right here in Allston-Brighton. “Oh, you guys are from here?” We nodded. He left us alone after that. I couldn’t help but think that we had just barely escaped something more serious.
On another night, my two friends and I were coming back from dinner on Harvard Avenue when an elderly white man, sitting on a bench with a flushed face and bottles at his feet, asked for the time before narrowing his eyes and pointing at us, demanding to know if we were Chinese. My friend and I both responded that we were Filipino. I closed my eyes in anticipation of my other friend’s response: “I’m Vietnamese, man,” he said, his voice breaking at the lie. There was a lump in the back of my throat. We walked in silence for several blocks afterwards. I still wonder what would have happened if he had told the truth.
The crux of the matter is this: If you take an ethnically diverse neighborhood whose residents are being forced out of their homes and onto the streets and you infuse it with hateful sentiment, you get a community fractured along race and class lines.
The totality of our experience tends to get overlooked when it comes to discussions about gentrification in Allston-Brighton. There is far more at stake here than winning state approval for development projects and rising property values — we’re hurting, and we need to find a way to heal. It’s time for Harvard to start paying attention to what its expansion is doing to the Allston-Brighton community.

Amid a fairly uneventful winter break back home, with the local news almost exclusively reporting on Omicron surges in New York City, my neighborhood was suddenly burning. On the morning of Jan. 9, I watched footage from NBC News in disbelief, terrified at the sight of a building only a mile away from my apartment engulfed in flames. I could not look away from the screen as children were pulled out on stretchers and people desperately gasped for air, their faces covered in soot. The fire, which originated from a space heater and produced lethal smoke that quickly spread due to open doors, killed at least 17 people and left 32 with life-threatening injuries.
What makes this fire particularly tragic — beyond its basic nature — is that it was clearly preventable. When considering both the cause of the fire and the reason it became so deadly, it is evident that hiding behind the headline of a devastating accident lies a larger story of negligence and disregard for human life.
The findings of the investigation into potential building violations have yet to be released; however, an investigation is hardly needed to deduce that had the building’s residents been provided with sufficient heating, they would not have needed to rely on a space heater to remain warm. Further, the Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department confirmed that although the fire itself did not expand beyond a single apartment, fatal fumes spread quickly because two doors leading to a hallway and a stairwell did not close, preventing residents from safely evacuating. As New York State law requires self-closing doors in buildings with three or more apartments, the malfunctioning of the self-closing mechanisms of multiple doors during the fire suggests further irresponsibility on the part of the landlords. Tenants also reported that the fire alarms frequently went off in the building, leading residents to instinctively ignore them.
Putting all of these factors together, the sickening reality is that 17 people, including eight children, lost their lives because their landlords were not sufficiently concerned with ensuring their survival. The building owners did not provide residents whose rent payments they presumably collected every month with basic necessities like adequate heating in the middle of January in New York City, reliable self-closing doors, and properly functioning fire alarms. By failing to act proactively, the landlords — who held the power to remedy all of the underlying causes of the fire — actively placed the lives of already vulnerable people at risk.
Witnessing the fire during my first long break home from college was striking. The image of the murderous blaze was a potent reminder that although I am shielded by the immense privilege of attending Harvard, this privilege does not extend to the place I call home. When I leave Greenough’s hardwood floors and the colorful study cubicles of Cabot Library, I return to a community where children die in their own homes because preserving human life is not at the top of landlords’ priority lists.
This fire was not an isolated incident. There is a long history of Bronx residents — who are overwhelmingly Black and Hispanic — losing their homes and lives to fires. During the 1970s, fires decimated 97 percent of the buildings in seven Bronx districts, and the four deadliest fires in New York City since 1990 have all occurred in the Bronx. It is not a coincidence that within the wealthiest city in the world, the borough in which fires rage most often houses the five poorest city council districts and the poorest congressional district in the nation. The Bronx has been burning for decades with no end in sight, revealing the minimal value with which Bronx lives are held.
Survivors of the fire filed a lawsuit against the owners of the building seeking up to $3 billion in relief for the tenants. While my hope is for the Court to rule in their favor, the truth is that no sum of money can fill the void of the 17 human beings whose lives were abruptly cut short on a Sunday morning or heal the trauma of all of the people who struggled to breathe as they evacuated their homes. I question if the lawsuit  — no matter the outcome — will ultimately make a difference for my community. As long as we live in a world where wealth and power dictate the value of people’s lives, it is difficult to predict an end to tragedies such as these.
In the wake of the fire, I am afforded a degree of solace by the unity and resilience that characterize the people of the Bronx. Without hesitation, community members stepped in to help by donating essential items, providing meals, and raising over $1.5 million to assist the victims in their recovery. Amidst all of the sorrow and tragedy that is, unfortunately, far from uncommon in the Bronx, we show up for our neighbors, consistently proving that our community cannot be torn down.
As I return to Cambridge for my second semester at Harvard, my heart a little heavier than when I left, I can say that this tragedy has reinforced my purpose for waking up every day: striving toward a future in which the Bronx ceases to burn.

Actors Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2022 Man and Woman of the Year, the organization announced earlier this month and last month.
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals — the oldest collegiate social club in the United States — began granting the Man and Woman of the Year awards to performers in 1951 and 1967, respectively, to acknowledge their lasting impact on the entertainment industry. Past recipients of the awards include Viola Davis, Paul Rudd, Anne Hathaway, and Clint Eastwood.
Garner is known for her performances in the television show “Alias” and in movies such as “13 Going on 30,” “Love Simon,” and “Juno.” She is also a co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, an organic food company focused on producing sustainable food for children.
An Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning actor, Bateman directs and stars in the Netflix series “Ozark.” At the age of 18, he became ​​the youngest director in the Directors Guild of America when he directed three episodes of “The Hogan Family.”
Bateman is also known for his leading roles in movies “Game Night” and “Horrible Bosses” and television show “Arrested Development.” In 2010, he co-founded Aggregate Films, which produced the Emmy-nominated HBO drama “The Outsider.”
“It’s been a hot minute since we’ve handed one of these out, so we figured we’d give it to the guy who all our moms have crushes on after watching ‘Ozark.’ Can’t wait to see you soon, Jason!” said Pudding President Nicholas L. “Nick” Amador ’22 in a Dec. 23 press release.
Last year, Viola Davis became the Pudding’s 71st Woman of the Year, attending an award ceremony and celebratory roast held remotely due to Covid restrictions. The organization did not name a Man of the Year recipient in 2021.
The Man of the Year celebration takes place on Feb. 3 and will culminate in a roast at Farkas Hall, where Bateman will receive his award, the Pudding Pot. Following the festivities, the Theatricals will perform a preview of its first show in two years due to the pandemic, “HPT 173: Ship Happens!”
Two days later, Garner will parade through Harvard Square alongside Hasty Pudding members. After her roast in Farkas Hall that evening, she will receive her Pudding Pot. The Woman of the Year festivities coincide with the opening night of “HPT 173: Ship Happens!”
“As a talented actress and philanthropist, Jennifer is a role model to all of us at Hasty Pudding Theatricals,” said Jacqueline E. Zoeller ’22-’23, Man and Woman of the Year Coordinator, in the release. “It is so wonderful to celebrate her in this exceptional year with the organization’s return to the stage.”

Harvard’s new set of Covid-19 protocols have garnered mixed reviews among students, who raised concerns about the College’s new isolate-in-place and contact tracing policies.
The University announced in early January it would continue operating at full residential capacity and maintain in-person instruction, despite the emergence of the Omicron variant.
In a series of emailed guidance to students, Harvard provided more details on its policies for the semester, flagging that students who test positive will now isolate in place. The policy marked a significant shift from prior protocol, under which infected students moved into isolation housing. In another shift from the previous policy, infected students will also be expected to conduct contact tracing themselves.
Ethan G. Tran ’24, who lives in a suite of six students — two of whom tested positive over the weekend — said that staying safe while living with suitemates who have Covid-19 felt a little bit like “flailing in the dark.”
“Our suite’s really close,” Tran continued. “So it was nice to have that, and I’m kind of worried for other people that might not have, necessarily, that connection with their suitemates or people in the Harvard community. It can be kind of hard, and I think it would be really scary.”
Isabella “Bella” Tarantino ’24, another member of the same suite, said that Harvard’s new policy letting individual instructors decide whether their class will be in-person or online for the first week put her in a difficult situation.
“They still told me to come to class [despite exposure] but I think that's like a big risk and puts me in an uncomfortable position where I have to go to class or else I'm losing points or I'm messing up my grade,” Tarantino said. “But I also morally feel I should not [go to class] because if this was last semester, I would have stayed home — they would have made me stay home.”
Students said it was surprising that Harvard expected students to conduct their own contact tracing.
“Contact tracing yourself may be kind of difficult, and I imagine that a lot of people aren’t going to be trying to do that,” said Hayden T. Teeter ’24.
Alvira Tyagi ’25, who has multiple allergies that affect her breathing, initially said she was worried about the isolate-in-place policy. But Tyagi said she felt more optimistic once the College clarified in a later email that there would be alternative housing – albeit limited and not guaranteed – for roommates of those who tested positive.
Teeter said he thinks offering the alternative housing option is “a really good move,” though he himself is not likely to move out if his roommate tests positive.
“I don’t have any pre-existing conditions causing me to be more susceptible to COVID, and I have a booster, so I’d probably just stick it out,” he said.
Melissa M. Shang ’25, who has a disability that puts her at high-risk of Covid-19 complications, raised concerns about the turnaround time between requesting and receiving alternative housing — a factor that was not explicitly stated in Harvard’s emails.
In a Monday statement to The Crimson, Aaron Goldman, a spokesperson for Harvard College, clarified, “for students whose requests are approved and who submit proof of a negative antigen test, the time between submitting their request and being able to move will typically be less than 24 hours.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment beyond previous administration communications.
Despite anxieties about the isolate-in-place policy, Kristian A. Hardy ’24 said Harvard’s decision to provide students with additional HEPA filters, rapid antigen tests, and KN95 masks are “great” and “a step in the right direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of Harvard student cultural groups expressed disappointment — and cautious optimism — following the Supreme Court’s decision Monday to hear a set of lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions practices.
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions brought the lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina, alleging the schools discriminate against Asian American applicants and violate civil rights law by considering race in their admissions processes. Lower courts ruled in favor of the schools, which deny the allegations, but SFFA petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision in February last year.
Harvard student leaders and alumni voiced dismay over the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case, which could determine the future of affirmative action in higher education.
Asian American Womxn’s Association co-president Angie D. Shin ’23 said race is an “inevitably impactful factor” to consider in admissions. She added she is “curious” about how the case will be ruled, both due to the Supreme Court’s makeup — a 6-3 conservative majority — and the case’s complexity.
“I am very apprehensive because of the current lineup of Supreme Court justices that will be reviewing the case, and also because the case has a lot of moving parts,” Shin said.
In their petition, SFFA asked the Supreme Court to overturn Grutter v. Bollinger, a landmark case which ruled in favor of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education admissions in 2003.
Thuan H. Tran ’23-’24, a co-coordinator for the Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies, said he was “ultimately optimistic” that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of affirmative action due to legal precedent.
“There is a very well-seated 40-year precedent of upholding affirmative action programs,” Tran said. “But I share the pessimism in terms of the current demographic makeup and ideological makeup of the court.”
In a statement shared through the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense Fund, which represents 25 Harvard student and alumni cultural organizations, Fuerza Latina leaders Nayleth E. Lopez-Lopez ’23 and Santy Mendoza ’23 wrote that they were “hurt and disappointed” by the Court’s decision.
“It will be painful to have to go through the stress of another legal battle wherein students’ right to celebrate all aspects of our identities and contribute to a more diverse school community would be put into question,” their statement read.
Farah M-A Afify ’22, president of the Phillips Brooks House Association, wrote in the Legal Defense Fund statement that Harvard’s admissions process allowed her identity to be considered more holistically when she applied.
“Because of affirmative action, my history as an Arab and Muslim immigrant contextualized the rest of my achievements, allowing my life and experiences to be considered more fully during the admissions process,” Afify wrote.
Michael G. Williams ’81 and Jeannie Park ’83, co-founders of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard — a group which says it represents nearly 2,000 alumni, students, staff, and faculty — wrote in a set of emailed statements that there would be widespread negative implications if the Court sides with SFFA.
“It would further limit the opportunities of marginalized students and communities, including Asian Americans,” Williams wrote. “It would say that race doesn’t matter in American life, which is simply untrue, and would cement the highly inequitable status quo.”
Echoing similar discontent, Park wrote that striking down race-conscious admissions would be a setback in Harvard’s trajectory towards a more inclusive campus.
“Harvard and other schools must not be blocked from pathways to building a more diverse campus and to equipping its students to confront the deep challenges of our society's growing inequity and strife,” Park wrote.
Lopez-Lopez and Mendoza wrote that a ruling in favor of SFFA would be detrimental to Latinx representation in higher education.
“It would be an incredible blow to holistic admissions practices across the country that are crucial in supporting underrepresented students in gaining admission into schools that have historically denied us opportunities and increasingly need our voices and perspectives,” Fuerza Latina’s statement reads.
Shin encouraged students to come together at Harvard and across the country to work toward a “fair, just direction” for future students.
“Race in America is hard. And so the only way to do it is to do it together,” Shin said.

A Harvard Law School clinic filed a federal lawsuit against United States immigration authorities last month over the government’s refusal to provide records about the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers.
The Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, one of 23 clinics housed at HLS, charged that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to provide public records in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.
The clinic sued the agencies after its FOIA requests “languished for years,” Sabrineh Ardalan, the clinic’s director, wrote in an email. The U.S. government is required by federal law to provide full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased documents and information.
The suit, filed on Dec. 13, called on the agencies to turn over requested records “concerning the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention.”
George Biashvili, a third-year Harvard Law student who joined in submitting the suit, said the government turned over just 30 censored pages out of thousands requested.
“The federal government has the duty to produce the information that’s requested,” Biashvili said. “Just because [new immigrants] don’t have citizenship, it doesn’t mean that they’re second-class citizens.”
The clinic has advocated for the end of solitary confinement in immigrant detention for years.
“We know solitary confinement is widely used in immigration detention facilities, both in Massachusetts and nationally, despite the fact that immigration detention is supposed to be civil and non-punitive,” Ardalan said.
Ardalan said that documents obtained via previous FOIA requests reveal “serious issues” with how immigrants with mental health conditions are assessed and treated.
Michael H. Shang, a third-year student at HLS who signed onto the suit, said the case resonated with him as a child of two immigrants, adding he hopes the litigation will lead to reforms at ICE.
“Once this information from before comes out, we’d really hope that advocates will have the information that they need to be more effective,” Shang said.
Ardalan wrote that the lawsuit could help protect marginalized populations in the future.
“​​Our hope is that, through the lawsuit, there will be greater transparency about the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention, particularly for vulnerable populations, including trauma survivors, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities,” Ardalan said.
DHS and ICE did not respond to requests for comment about the suit.
Correction: January 26, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated federal immigration agencies turned over 31 censored pages out of thousands requested by the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic via Freedom of Information Requests. In fact, the government turned over 30 censored pages.

After the Supreme Court agreed Monday to take up a lawsuit challenging race-conscious admissions processes at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, legal experts say the case could spell the end of affirmative action in higher education.
The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case marks the latest update in a contentious seven-year-long legal battle between anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions and Harvard. SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014, alleging that the school’s admissions practices discriminate against Asian American applicants.
Harvard Law School professor Richard H. Fallon Jr. said the Court’s choice to accept the petition could be “a major setback” for affirmative action initiatives.
“This is bad news for Harvard and Harvard’s admissions program, and it could turn out to be very bad news,” Fallon said.
“There was no reason whatsoever for the Supreme Court to grant cert in this case, except for the purpose of giving very serious consideration to either sharply cutting back on what it takes to be the legal permissibility of affirmative action or holding affirmative action to be unconstitutional all together,” he added.
Laurence H. Tribe ’62, who taught constitutional law at Harvard for 54 years, said he believes a majority of the current Supreme Court justices are in agreement with SFFA’s claims.
“It seems to me absolutely clear that six justices on the current Court believe that any consideration of race in university admission policies either violates the 14th amendment, in the case of a state university like the University of North Carolina, or violates Title VI, in the case of a university like Harvard that receives federal funding,” Tribe said. “I don’t think there’s any mystery about it.”
Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz said the decision to grant certiorari, which requires four or more votes, suggests that at least four justices may vote against the consideration of race in college admissions.
“I believe there are three votes in favor of allowing it to be taken into account, and I think the deciding votes will be cast by the Chief Justice Roberts and probably Justice Kavanaugh, but perhaps Justice Barrett,” he said.
Despite predicting a likely victory for SFFA, Fallon praised the University’s legal team and Tribe said he remains confident in Harvard’s ability to adapt its admissions process should the Court strike down its current practices.
“Universities as intelligent as Harvard will find ways of dealing with the decision without radically altering their composition,” Tribe said. “But they will have to be more subtle than they have been thus far.”
Natasha K. Warikoo, a Tufts sociology professor who researches racial and ethnic inequality in education, said a ruling in favor of SFFA would be “incredibly problematic” for underrepresented minority applicants. Still, Warikoo said she is “cautiously optimistic” that the Court will uphold affirmative action.
“I don’t think it’s a done deal that they will rule against race-conscious admissions,” Warikoo said. “There’s been a lot of research showing the benefits of racial diversity on selective college campuses.”
SFFA first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, arguing that the school’s admissions practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.” The Massachusetts District Court ruled in favor of Harvard in October 2019, and the First Circuit Court affirmed the ruling in November 2020.
SFFA then petitioned the Supreme Court to take up the case last February, requesting that the justices overturn precedent set forth by the 2003 landmark case Grutter v. Bollinger. In its brief in opposition in May 2021, Harvard asked the court to deny SFFA’s appeal.
The Supreme Court delayed its decision to take action on the case in June when it requested input from the U.S. Solicitor General on the lawsuit. Though the Trump administration backed SFFA, the Biden administration sided with Harvard in December, urging the court to reject SFFA’s appeal.
Dershowitz predicted the Court’s decision on the case could have lasting implications on the future of affirmative action in higher education.
“There’s a strong likelihood that the court will do what Justice O’Connor said many years ago – saying that there was a time limit on race-based affirmative action,” Dershowitz said. “And that time limit may have expired.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Men’s Hockey team spent the last weekend before the second academic semester contesting a pair of games against St. Lawrence University and Clarkson University, other members of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).
The Crimson were missing their top two point producers, junior captain and forward Nick Abruzzese and sophomore forward Sean Farrell due to health and safety protocols. Their absence this weekend acted as a test of adjustment, as Abruzzese and Farrell will depart in the coming weeks to represent Team USA at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
HARVARD 3, CLARKSON 4
The line of sophomore forward Alex Laferriere, junior forward John Farinacci, and first-year forward Alex Gaffney continued to click, putting Harvard in front 1-0 just 29 seconds into the game. After breaking through the neutral zone to create a two-on-one opportunity, Lafferiere skated down the left side and flipped a perfect backhand pass to Farinacci, who quickly cut from the right side to his backhand and tucked the puck past Clarkson goaltender Jacob Mucitelli. Gaffney also recorded an assist on the goal.
However, the strong start was soon erased. The Golden Knights responded with the equalizer 55 seconds later, as defenseman Noah Beck’s shot from the right point snuck through heavy traffic and bounced off the post past sophomore goaltender Derek Mullahy. The goal was reviewed to see if the puck completely crossed the goal line, and the play stood as called.
“We just didn’t execute some basic fundamentals and details,” head coach Ted Donato said. “We turned it over in our own zone, and we didn’t make the simple but essential plays you need to make.”
The Crimson reclaimed their early lead just over three minutes later on a fantastic individual effort from first-year left wing Zakary Karpa. Bumped up to the first line due to Covid-related absences, Karpa took the puck from the wing on his backhand and forced his way through the Clarkson defender and to the net, where he poked the puck past Mucitelli to give Harvard a 2-1 lead. However, Clarkson right wing Anthony Romano cashed in on a power play three minutes later, hammering a one-time slap shot from the faceoff circle past Mullahy to knot the game at 2.
The second period was far less active, as both teams significantly tightened their play and upped their physicality in the defensive zone. However, an interference penalty in the neutral zone on Clarkson defenseman Tommy Pasanen opened the door for the Crimson to take the lead.
Despite a poor power play in the first period, Harvard was much stronger on their second chance with the man advantage, maintaining possession and pressure in the offensive zone for most of the two minutes. With six seconds remaining on the power play, Gaffney tapped home a loose puck in front of the net off a feed from Farinacci to put the Crimson on top 3-2.
The third period continued the tight defensive structure of the second period until a chaotic sequence halfway through the period. Following a Golden Knights four-on-three rush, Clarkson fed the puck from the wing into the high slot, where the Golden Knights forward narrowly missed an open net, clanging a wrist shot off the post. The puck then ricocheted back into the slot, setting off a mad scramble around the net that ended when junior forward Austin Wong blocked a slap shot out of the defensive zone.
Although Harvard survived the flurry of Clarkson chances, the mad net-front scramble proved to be a turning point in the game. From that point forward, the Golden Knights were buzzing, forcing the Crimson into defensive zone turnovers, and hemming them in with persistent offensive pressure and forechecking. With 6:34 remaining in the third period, Clarkson forward Nick Campoli tapped in a loose puck in front of the net to knot the game at 3 goals apiece.
“We need to be able to play in tighter games with more detail, and it’s something we’ve talked a lot about,” Ted Donato said. “We’re a little bit immature, as a group, in that regard.”
The Golden Knights weren’t done yet. Only 1:22 later, Campoli put Clarkson in front on a similar play, easily tapping in a rebound from just outside the crease. Campoli’s second goal proved to be the game-winner, as the Golden Knights were able to withstand a slew of Harvard chances with the goaltender on the bench for an extra attacker, pulling out the ECAC victory 4-3.
“We need to pick up guys going to the net, we need to handle rebounds better,” Ted Donato said. “In crunch time, guys can’t be left alone. We can’t get beat off the rush and we can’t lose stick battles at the front of our net when the game’s on the line.”
Despite the difficult loss, senior forward and captain Casey Dornbach saw positives in the team’s play, especially with the younger players getting more ice time given the numerous absences facing the team.
“I think the young guys have been great,” Dornbach said. “We’re learning to do the details in tough games like that, three to two going into the third. You’ve got to find a way to have a clean third and come out with a win."
HARVARD 4, ST. LAWRENCE 1
Although the competition was less difficult, Harvard took down its first challenger of the weekend with ease, defeating unranked St. Lawrence 4-1 at Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Friday. Coming into the game, the Saints held a record of 5-11-4.
“I think we’re heading in the right direction,” Dornbach said. “We believe we have a great group in the locker room.”
The Crimson started the game strong and fast. It kept possession in its offensive zone, barely giving St. Lawrence a chance to breathe. Within the first eleven minutes of the period, it outshot the Saints 18 to six. It finally converted a possession at 12:10 into the period, when Karpa corralled his own rebound, assisted by Dornbach and first-year forward Matthew Coronato.
Just over a minute later, Harvard struck again. Fed by first-year defenseman Jack Bar, Farinacci finished a beautiful open-net goal to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead. Harvard continued its control, outskating and outshooting the Saints throughout the period. It was held to two goals, however, as St. Lawrence goalkeeper Emil Zetterquist stayed strong between the posts.
In the beginning of the second period, the Saints tightened their defense, as there was no elongated control of the puck by the Crimson within its offensive zone. The transition of possession among the two teams was fast and more frequent, with neither team being able to hold the puck long enough to set up a proper offensive opportunity.
Harvard began to recalibrate and find its rhythm after being forced to the penalty kill by junior forward Wyllum Deveaux’s slashing penalty 4:53 into the period. Repeated saves by junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson helped the Crimson keep composure.
About four minutes later, 8:48 into the period, Laferriere notched his first goal of the game to stretch Harvard’s lead to 3-0, off Gaffney’s rebound, who, along with junior defenseman Ryan Siedem, was credited with an assist.
However, within a minute, the Crimson was forced back onto the penalty kill, as Wong was sent to the box for charging. The penalty kill unit again held strong, defusing the Saints’ advantage, with a breakaway by Jack Donato denying St. Lawrence an opportunity to set up their attack.
The period continued with a quick transition game, with Coronato being notably snuffed on multiple breakaway shot attempts by the Saints’ Zetterquist. St. Lawrence finally got on the board with 2:18 left in the period, after Saints forward Philippe Chapleau took a rebound, splitting the Crimson’s Bar and senior defenseman Marshall Rifai as a backhanded shot found the back of the net. St. Lawrence rode the momentum and kept the puck for the remainder of the period, but they failed to score again.
The third period was more similar to the first– Harvard came out strong and fast, controlling possession. 6:52 into the period, Laferriere netted his second goal of the game, assisted by Gaffney and Farinacci, effectively putting the nail in the Saints’ coffin.
Although it soon went to the penalty kill again, after Coronato was charged with hooking, the unit defused the advantage again, lowering St. Lawrence’s power play conversion rate to 7% on the season, the second-lowest in the ECAC.
The Crimson finished the game with confidence, not allowing another goal, despite not being able to finish another of its own. However, despite a strong third period in Friday’s game, the Crimson struggled to close out Saturday’s game. After the weekend’s games, Ted Donato urged his team to play more aggressively in the third period.
“We talked about playing on our toes, not on our heels, to start the third period,” he said of the team’s late game play. Harvard’s poor puck management and weak defense around the net allowed the Golden Knights to erase a late deficit Saturday, according to Ted Donato, as the Crimson dropped a 4-3 decision despite leading 3-2 after two periods.
“Just like every game, we’ve got to look at it objectively. There were a lot of positives, but there were some negatives that cost us,” Dornbach said. “We’ll be looking for a quick and short memory, bouncing back and using what we can from this game but moving forward.”
The Crimson will face Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, another ECAC opponent, at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this Tuesday, January 25th at 6pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cruising past Dartmouth (1-16, 0-5 Ivy League) earlier in the week 96-62, Harvard women’s basketball (9-9, 3-3) turned in yet another dominant performance last Saturday over conference foe Cornell Big Red (6-10, 1-4), winning the matchup 89-47 under the bright lights of Lavietes Pavilion.
The Crimson applied early pressure on the defensive end, which generated Big Red turnovers and allowed Harvard to race out to a 22-0 lead. During the initial Crimson onslaught, junior guards McKenzie Forbes and Annie Striztel each recorded stretches of three consecutive baskets from the field. Forbes and Stritzel finished the night with 16 and 12 points, respectively, and they were joined in double figures by junior guard Maggie McCarthy (18), first-year guard Harmoni Turner (14), and senior guard Tess Sussman (10).
When asked what led her team to such an explosive start, including a 31-4 lead at the end of the first quarter, Harvard head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith praised her team’s defensive intensity. Although Harvard lacks a true forward in its five-guard starting lineup, she credited her players with being able to converge on Cornell in the paint and quickly recover to guard the three-point line.
“I felt we were focused on reading passing lanes, making them try to get back on their heels and we did that,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we may have had an all-time high of 19 steals. When you do that, turnovers turn into points [on the offensive end]. That does wonders for your confidence, and we haven't done that in a while. So pretty happy with that.”
The Crimson lead stretched to 81-30 at the end of the third quarter, largely due to Harvard’s impressive shooting from three-point range. As the fourth quarter began, the team had converted 50 percent (14-for-28) of its attempts from deep, and three Crimson starters finished with four makes each (McCarthy, Forbes, Turner). As Delaney-Smith noted, Saturday’s shooting performance is an encouraging sign for a young team trying to find the balance of three-point attempts and points in the paint.
“We are still trying to strike the balance of a young team and a new-to-each-other team [and] striking the balance of threes,” Delaney-Smith explained. “We obviously don't have the traditional inside presence, but we have an ability to get to the basket. If I were to critique my team, we default to the quick three more than I think we should, and it's because I have three, four, even five ‘greenlight’ shooters out there at once. I don't want them to settle for the quick three as often as they do. I do not want that. I would prefer a quick three within the system — which is drive, kick, drive, kick, pass, one more [pass]. Those kinds of things are coming off screens. So it's just striking the balance of a ‘system three’ versus ‘I settled for the quick three.’”
While Harvard has coasted to commanding wins in its last two games, the past five weeks have not been without their challenges. Notably, players being out due to injuries and Covid-19 have made it difficult for the Crimson to establish a consistent rotation.
“Team chemistry has always been outstanding, [but] the rotation is all over the map because of Covid and how many players are either battling Covid or battling an injury,” Delaney-Smith said. “There isn't a normalcy to our rotation at all. It's just whoever gets the call — I'm asking you to step up. I'm trying to get the emphasis and the focus to be on defense and rebounding. And again, we're pretty inconsistent in that regard.”
A thinner Harvard bench in the last month, however, has led to the emergence of less experienced players who have performed well on the court. Delaney-Smith singled out junior guard Sara Park, first-year guard Elena Rodriguez, and sophomore forward Lindsey Lawson as players who have dealt with frustrating time out of the lineup, yet also flashed strong play in their time on the court.
“There are young players like Lindsey Lawson — [Saturday was] her first day back in a long time,” Delaney-Smith smith. “She got a concussion in the Princeton game and has been out ever since. She's a young player, so she's lost a lot of her growth and development, I feel. Her potential is off the charts, [but] she's sort of got to get her legs back. Sarah Park was having an absolutely extraordinary season, [but] has been battling setbacks and then [was] unable to play [in four of the last seven games], and she's now in the rotation.”
Beyond the five-guard starting lineup of Turner, Forbes, Sussman, McCarthy, and sophomore guard Lola Mullaney, as well as rotation players Stritzel and senior forward Maddie Stuhlreyer, Coach Delaney-Smith will be looking for younger players to provide a spark off the bench as the heart of Ivy League play awaits. That crucial portion of the schedule begins this Saturday, January 29th at 2:00 p.m. when the Crimson travel to Philadelphia to face the Penn Quakers (7-9, 2-2).
“I think the key is to stay healthy. And I mean, we can only control what we can control. Who knows where the chips are gonna fall with injuries and Covid. We're just going to deal with it as it comes our way.”

Love It: It’s Pretty and I’m Shallow — Raymond Wu
Picture this: You’re walking to Sever having just gotten up 30 minutes ago, still groggy and cursing life. But then the sight of the trees framing the concrete path ahead of you makes your sad dreary life just a little less sad and dreary. You get a beautiful view of Memorial Church, of Widener Library, and of Sever Hall itself, that large formidable classroom building chock full of history. I have math in Sever Hall this semester, so maybe not the most invigorating class, but after a year of virtual learning, it’s so nice to be back in a classroom with actual blackboards. It’s comforting. And as a first-year, it’s the moments when I’m in Sever that it really, truly feels like I’m in college. Plus, if I’m ever feeling a ‘lil sleepy during math, I have the church bells to wake me up every hour. Sever also has conference rooms with large, rounded tables that I admittedly have not been in very often, but when I have, I feel like I’m about to eat a very fancy dinner. It’s a nice feeling.
And that’s why I love Sever: the impeccable vibes.
Hate It: Looks Can Be Deceiving — Annette Kim
If there is any class building on campus that needs renovating, it is Sever Hall. Despite being called an architectural masterpiece from the outside, Sever is just an inconvenient experience from the inside. As someone who has two of my four classes in Sever, my main complaint is its horrendous bathroom situation. Whoever thought that two bathrooms were sufficient for a building of four floors was seriously mistaken. Imagine you are in the middle of class on the second floor when you’re hit with the sudden urge to relieve yourself. You run down the stairs to the basement where a long line of jumpy students separate you and the two—stalled monstrosity that Sever offers as the bathroom. You’re disappointed and in pain as you are forced to trudge all five flights of stairs to the fourth floor bathroom just to see that there is yet another line at the only other teeny tiny bathroom. There is no reason why a building that is meant to imprison hold 200 students at a time should only have two bathrooms. Bathroom issues aside, the classrooms are extremely stuffy since half the windows don’t open, the chairs are the most uncomfortable pieces of plastic and metal to exist, AND why is the elevator so hard to find? Sever’s only saving grace is that it’s near Memorial Church from which you can hear the beautiful chimes of the bells assuring you that class is almost over and you can leave the building soon.

Why can’t I find love? You know. Normal stuff. And if this class isn’t enough, at least we’ve got Datamatch coming up.
While I can verify quite literally zero information about these classes, at least all your future employers can say “Man. What an interesting course schedule” every time they look at your transcript! And that’s a far better win than a “good GPA” or “intellectual challenge” or “transformational experience” anyway.
