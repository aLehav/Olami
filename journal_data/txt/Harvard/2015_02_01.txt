After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, PA— In its two games against Penn last year, the Harvard men’s basketball team notched two victories by a combined 50-point margin.
In 2015, the story appears stuck on the same script.
With its 63-38 victory at the Palestra Saturday night, the Crimson (13-5, 3-1 Ivy) notched its fourth win against the Quakers (6-11, 1-2) in five tries and third consecutive victory by 20 or more points over Penn. Harvard led by 30 or more for most of the second half, shooting 49 percent from the field and outrebounding the Quakers, 37-25.
The Crimson swept the Princeton-Penn road trip for the second year in a row after not having done so for 29 years. Harvard has won 10 consecutive Ancient Eight road games since losing at Penn two years ago.
“I thought we really played a tremendous 40 minutes of basketball,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was impressed and pleased with the effort our kids brought on the defensive end. I thought we played disciplined defense, which is what we need to do on the road, and were efficient on the offensive end.”
Throughout the game, the Crimson suffocated the Quakers on the defensive end. Penn finished the game with more turnovers (14) than made field goals (13), connecting on just 30 percent of its shots. But Harvard’s offense also struggled early before co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi hit the bench after committing his second foul with 6:25 left in the half.
Spreading the floor around senior forward Jonah Travis, the Crimson went with the four-out lineup with which it found success Friday night against Princeton. Harvard finished the first half on a 16-5 run, with junior point guard Siyani Chambers nailing a three-pointer as the clock wound down.
For the game, Chambers led all scorers with 14 points—12 of which came in the first half. He and senior wing Wesley Saunders combined for eight assists and just one turnover on the game, keeping the Crimson’s offense moving and breaking down the Penn zone time and time again.
“[Turnovers] are probably the first thing,” Chambers said. “The coaching staff and my teammates are relying on me as the point guard to make good decisions with the ball.”
On the defensive end, Saunders helped corral the Quakers’ leading guard Tony Hicks into a two-for-eight shooting night and just six points. Hicks, freshman Antonio Woods, and junior Darien Nelson-Henry—arguably Penn’s three most important players—had just five made field goals between them.
A late scoring burst kept the Quakers from being held under 20 points in both halves; as it was, Harvard’s defense rebounded from giving up 72 to Princeton to tie its season best in points allowed. Although the Crimson benefited from a series of Penn turnovers, it also kept the Quakers off the offensive boards all game. Harvard won the rebounding battle by 12 and Travis had almost as many offensive rebounds (five) by himself as Penn had in the game (six).
For the second straight night, the senior big man provided the jolt his team needed with eight points, 10 rebounds, and two steals. Despite giving up size to both Nelson-Henry and Penn forward Greg Louis, Travis routinely went up and around the Quaker big men for rebound after rebound.
“I love playing with Jonah,” Moundou-Missi said. “He brings that energy and has that fight in him. He plays hard every single possession and you have to love that about him.”
The team once again got unexpected offensive production from junior wing Agunwa Okolie. After averaging a hair over five points a game coming into the weekend, Okolie posted back-to-back double-digit efforts for the first time in his career. He knocked down four of the five shots he took from the field, cutting into the teeth of the Quaker defense for a series of dunks and layups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In dramatic fashion, the Harvard women’s tennis team came from behind on Saturday to beat Boston College, 4-3, in Chestnut Hill.
With the Crimson trailing 3-2 after five matches, freshman Nikki Kallenberg and captain Sylvia Li propelled their team past the Eagles in the day’s final two contests. Li picked up victories in her singles and doubles matches to give the team its first win over BC in the senior’s four-year tenure.
Though No. 49 Harvard (3-1 overall, 0-0 Ivy League) entered the weekend ranked slightly higher than the No. 6 Eagles (1-3, 0-0 ACC) in the most recent Intercollegiate Tennis Association women’s national team rankings, Crimson coach Traci Green expected a tight battle with BC, especially after the host team’s strong performance last weekend in Chapel Hill, N.C.
“A lot of credit goes to BC,” Green said. “Every time we play them, it’s always a barnburner, and it’s always nice to have a crosstown rivalry. We really fought tooth and nail the entire match. I’m really proud of our squad and the way they came together and believed the whole way.”
After Kallenberg tied the contest at three wins apiece following her victory over sophomore Lexi Borr, it was down to Li’s match with junior Wan-Yi Sweeting. Despite Li’s four years of experience on the team, the senior had played in primarily doubles matches during her four years, with Saturday being only her second start at singles this season.
Her inexperience did not show in the moment her teammates needed her the most. She drew inspiration from Kallenberg, who was finishing her match on a neighboring court.
“I definitely felt a bit of pressure going in, knowing that it would probably come down to my match,” Li said. “It was also great because usually [the pressure] makes you play better…. Nikki really helped at the finish, knowing that she was fighting right next to me.”
For Li, the win was particularly special because it was the first time Harvard had beaten the Eagles during Li’s time in Cambridge. BC carried a three-year winning streak against Harvard into the weekend.
“I’m really proud of the way Sylvia stepped up,” Green said. “She played outstanding in doubles, and she also stepped up quite nicely when we needed her in singles. So it was great to see her, in her senior year, come through, and we’re looking to build off of our team momentum.”
Green went with a different lineup Saturday than the team had used in any of its three prior matches. While sophomore June Lee, Kallenberg, sophomore Monica Lin, and freshman Annika Ringblom remained the top four, Amanda Li shifted up to the number five spot and Sylvia Li played six. The move seemed to pay off down the stretch for Harvard.
In the day’s early matches, Lee lost in straight sets from the top position to Eagles’ senior Jessica Wacnik while Monica and Amanda Lin both fell to their BC counterparts. While Li’s performance ultimately proved to be the clincher for the Crimson, Green was quick to credit Kallenberg, who played in a three-set do or die match, and Ringblom, who picked up a straight set victory for Harvard.
“We’re really proud of the way our freshmen have adjusted to college tennis,” Green said. “It’s very different from junior tennis. But they’re really into team, we’re a very ‘teamy’ team this year. When you compete for each other out there, it makes it so much easier.”
In the doubles match, Li also helped the Crimson secure a point. The freshman duo of Ellen Jang-Milsten and Kallenberg fell, but Monica Lin and Ringblom as well Li and Amanda Lin picked up victories from the second and third doubles spots.
“If someone can’t play or if someone’s not having a good day, we try to stay positive and make sure we’re there for each other because we know we’re able to count on anyone else on the team to pull through,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly three weeks after No. 19/21 Princeton’s last game, an impressive 29-point victory over Penn, the Tigers (18-0, 2-0 Ivy) proved to Harvard (8-9, 1-2) what 17 other teams around the country have already discovered: Princeton is no ordinary Ivy League basketball team. The 96-46 win for the visiting Tigers on Friday at Lavietes Pavilion extends the team’s win streak to 18-straight games to start the season, the longest an Ivy League women’s basketball team has ever gone without a loss.
Coming into the game, Princeton was in the top ten in the nation in three statistical categories: scoring margin, field goal percentage, and three-point percentage. The Tiger’s shooting prowess was on display once again against the Crimson, as the visitors shot 59% from the field overall and an astonishing 60% from behind the arc.
“We had an underdog mentality coming in,” senior forward Erin McDonnell said. “We were relaxed yet focused early on. Having said that, we knew they were a good team and that they were very disciplined. Our game plan was to stop their shooters and not get beat on the drive.”
Harvard was able to hang around in the early minutes of play due to five turnovers in the first five minutes of play from Princeton. However, a 15-5 run midway through the first half gave the Tigers their first double digit lead of the game, 27-13. A three from junior guard Shilpa Tummala and three free throws from senior forward Temi Fagbenle momentarily cut the lead to eight, but the Tigers responded with a 9-0 run that featured Crimson turnovers on four-straight possessions.
“We thought we were ready, but we just didn’t show up,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They set the tone and went after our guards, and then our guards didn’t get the ball down low to the forwards.”
At halftime, Princeton had 44 points on only 27 shots and held an 18-10 edge over the Crimson on the boards. In fact, 32 of the team’s 44 first-half points were off of either offensive rebounds or steals.
Two quick buckets for McDonnell at the start of the second half cut the Tiger lead to 15, but Princeton’s balanced scoring attack that saw four Tigers end the game in double figures was too much for Harvard to handle.
Princeton senior guard Blake Dietrich hit a layup and two threes as part of a 16-0 response from Tigers that put the game out of reach with nearly 12 minutes to go in the second half, as the Princeton took a 61-30 lead.
“The big focus [coming in] was not letting [Dietrich] drive on us,” Tummala said. “At the same time, we knew it would be important to get a hand up when we switched out on her, cause she is obviously a great outside shooter as well.”
Dietrich finished with 18 points on 7-11 shooting from the field. The senior guard also hit four of her six shots from downtown and added six assists, four rebounds, and three steals.
Playing from behind for the entire evening, the Crimson shot just 24% from the field on the night and only had one player, Fagbenle, reach double figures in points. The senior finished 3-9 from the field, but knocked down seven free throws en route to her 13 points.
“I think [Princeton] is a very disciplined team on offense and on defense,” McDonnell said. “They know the looks they are trying to get on offense, and defensively we kind of fell into their comfort zone. They love to pick passes and get easy steals. It’s contagious, they all start playing well and shots start falling.”
