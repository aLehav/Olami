After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A casual scroll through a week’s worth of my accumulated emails this morning revealed the following messages: an ad for a Collegium concert, an invitation to an OAASIS welcome reception, an invitation to a CARE workshop, campaign messages from multiple UC tickets, a prison divestment intro meeting, a CBE startup meeting, and more than 130 other distinct message threads opened in my College email between Oct. 28 and Nov. 4.
Each cause I listed above deserves publicity and needs to be advertised. I myself would be interested in attending or learning about all of them. But when they’re all thrown at our inbox in a disorganized fashion, especially publicity emails, we don’t have enough time to react to all of them or display them in the context of our current, demanding schedules. As such, we often miss out on opportunities that we might otherwise take advantage of. Such an overload of emails should be replaced by a University events calendar run on a single, unified platform.
Our email overload has reached the point where we’re inventing new vocabulary to respond to it. When I first arrived at Harvard, I was introduced to the term “bumping,” which is Harvard-speak for pushing an email that’s a few days old to the top of the recipient’s inbox so the recipient doesn’t lose track of it.
A Google Search for “bumping an email” reveals only four distinct search results that contain the phrase verbatim — in other schools and institutions, it seems, the concept isn’t common enough to mandate its inclusion into their lexicon. Indeed, I was told earlier this year as the stage manager of an Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club show that if I wanted to make sure cast members saw my email, I had to create an entirely separate thread each time, because there was no way the cast would unearth a second email in an existing thread.
This culture of constant email publicizing has consequences. Things get missed, especially by first-year students who aren’t used to this sudden blitz of emails. Six hundred and thirty-eight of the 1,343 emails I’ve received since creating my Harvard email in June have been marked as “Important,” which eliminates professors’ and administrators’ ability to trust this marking as a safeguard when communicating truly important messages. Rooting out the emails that require a reply can take hours, and combing through one’s inbox for such emails takes up a far larger proportion of the typical Harvard student’s day than is needed.
Part of the reason is that Harvard students are blessed to be near many different opportunities and happenings. Guest speakers like Supreme Court justices Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, comedian Dave Chappelle, and activist Colin Kaepernick have all appeared on campus this fall. Student groups are constantly churning out performances, and our athletic teams constantly seek support.
All of this is fantastic. But there are more and less effective ways to inform us of these opportunities. This is where the Undergraduate Council should step in, to create an accessible and all-encompassing calendar of campus events and notifications that could be integrated with our Canvas academic calendars.
Such a calendar could be filtered to include only events students have marked as particularly interesting or relevant to them, plus more general announcements from the University. Indeed, groups advertising events often send out emails the day of or the day before an event, while a co-curricular calendar gives students more notice and more of a chance to react.
Certainly, many Harvard student organizations operate their own calendars, and students often plan their schedules through Facebook events created by their friends. But this lacks centralization. It is the dark age of student planning. Imagine if, at the beginning of each semester, your most reliable source of finding classes to shop was your friend’s Facebook feed. Our course catalog is excellent, and we should have a co-curricular catalog that matches it.
It’s been three years now since Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders stood on a debate stage and bellowed to the world that he was sick and tired of talking about Hillary Clinton’s damn emails. At Harvard, we’re sick and tired of sorting through ours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Undergraduate Council election wraps up after a season of heavy campaigning on a wide array of issues, two referenda this year ask students whether the University should divest its endowment from holdings in the prison-industrial complex and the fossil fuel industry. We urge students to vote “No” on both questions.
We believe that these referenda are inappropriate and represent a misuse of UC efforts. Divestment is a complex and multifaceted political tactic, and the Council does not have any authority to effect change on this front. While referenda have often been symbolic in the past, and explicitly designed to gauge student opinion on the issues they discuss, there is little the Council and the student body can do to change the very tangible actions of the Harvard Management Corporation, which oversees the University's endowment. Such referenda, even if passed, are entirely symbolic. Given the particular impossibility of enacting these referenda, we urge the UC and the student body in future election cycles to only consider those referenda that will actually effect change.
Fossil fuels and the prison-industrial complex are each important issues. Scientists unequivocally contend that fossil fuel usage largely drives anthropogenic climate change, as we have noted in the past. With global temperatures rising 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, this problem is dire. Likewise, the prison-industrial complex is also heinous, especially given the lucrative $4.8 billion-dollar private prison industry — which has become ever-increasingly ubiquitous — and the U.S.’s imprisonment rate, which is the highest of 222 countries tracked by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research. These are issues that simply must be addressed.
All this said, we reaffirm our view, upheld many times in the past, that divestment is not a viable course of action, given that it has no ability to effect social change, as both of these industries are deeply intertwined with global financial systems. Moreover, at a particularly difficult time for Harvard’s financial future, we do not believe that withdrawing from industries for political reasons is advisable — and the University has already paused investment in some fossil fuels.
Overall, the Council’s choice to include these referenda appears well-intentioned but myopic. In urging our peers to vote no on these two referenda, we encourage them to think deeply about the wider ramifications for Harvard. As University President Lawrence S. Bacow and other University figures have argued, there are more effective ways Harvard and its affiliates can educate and inform the public in ways that do not unduly politicize and jeopardize the endowment. We support these alternative methods as viable ways of effecting social change, and hope that they are given greater weight in future discussions. For now, College students should avoid ineffective referenda calling for ineffective solutions.
This staff editorial is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I wasn’t all that disheartened a week ago Tuesday when I learned that Charlie D. Baker ’79 had won reelection as Governor of Massachusetts.
Friends and readers know that I’m no Republican. I find my views on government generally intractable with theirs — at least on the basic importance of the New Deal in securing opportunity for working-class America. But Baker was a curious case.
I remember being a senior in high school and reading about his unexpected victory, wondering how it was that a Republican had won the Massachusetts governorship. Having since read up on his platform, I’ve come to realize we hold many of our political positions in common.
Baker has demanded that gender identity be included in all civil rights protections. He acknowledges that global warming is man-made and has called for reducing Massachusetts’ carbon footprint. He supports mandatory background checks and other measures to restrict gun ownership. He’s investing in a revamped MBTA.
These are the markings of a certain breed of Republican. Not a Democrat by any stretch, but a fellow traveler. These blue-state Republicans seem endemic to New England. (Vermont has one in Phil B. Scott, as does New Hampshire in Chris T. Sununu.) None is quite the hoped-for liberal, but none evokes the kind of hostility to basic notions of progress, procedure, or civil liberties that we’re witnessing from the national GOP.
This cohort of blue-state Republicans also signals a kind of possibility that I find encouraging. I call it the possibility of collective progress.
The basic element of that principle is that we Democrats are willing to come together with Republicans to foster a shared idea of civic and cultural improvement, acknowledging and accommodating reasonable differences. It doesn’t mean we won’t go it alone if we have to — particularly on issues of fundamental human rights like immigration, welfare, or police brutality — but we’d rather go it together for the sake of the country.
"Go it together" was the governing philosophy of the Democratic Party for a long time. Clinton’s “triangulation” strategy was built around it, emphasizing cooperation where possible and majority muscle where necessary. Obama carried this legacy forward, making important leftward strides in expanding health care coverage and regulating Wall Street while working alongside Republicans on issues like the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy (which prevented gay members of the military from serving while “out”), mandatory-minimum sentences for drug offenses, and the passage of tax cuts and other economic stimulus after the financial crisis.
Over the last few years, widening partisan divides have begun to test that modus operandi. Trump in particular has shown no interest in cooperating to bring relief to immigrants or climate change. He often throws his weight behind highly contentious public figures as if for the sake of stoking division (Brett Kavanaugh and Roy Moore are two that come to my mind). In that environment, the idea of a virtuous common ground atrophies. One author recently observed, in what I take as a sign of the times, that “compromise is not valuable in its own right, and justice seldom dwells in the [political] middle.” Under Trump, as under the South African apartheid regime that that author writes of, this might well be true.
But in the most recent election cycle, I saw signs that it is still possible to go it together. Kansas — traditionally a Republican bastion — elected a Democratic woman governor in Laura Kelly to lead the state. Kansans also elected a Democrat to represent the state’s third district in Congress (sending one of the first two Native American women legislators to Capitol Hill).
Montanans, who voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump in the presidential election, re-elected Democrat Jon Tester to the Senate, despite Trump’s stumping for Republican opponent Matt Rosendale. Tester supports a range of progressive economic and environmental causes including reviewing the Citizens United decision, which expanded corporate campaign finance, and funding clean-up efforts in the Great Lakes and coastal regions.
Marylanders re-elected Republican Larry Hogan to their state’s governorship. Hogan’s opposition to gerrymandering, bump stocks for semi-automatic weapons, and contamination of the Chesapeake Bay are strong starting points, even if they aren’t by themselves a full liberal platform.
I wouldn’t have been disappointed if the so-called “blue wave” had reached beyond just the House. If the results had been as decisive elsewhere as they were in Congress, I would have told a different story. As the facts stand however, many Americans seem unconvinced by the promise of progressive, multicultural liberal democracy. It is their right to express political skepticism as they see fit, just as it is ours.
It is in our best interest to sustain the ‘go it together’ spirit of the latter-day Democrats. It’s also the right thing to do in a country of fractious and fast-moving politics. If Baker or Hogan wants to help us diminish our carbon footprint and limit gun ownership, I say welcome aboard. If Kansans want a Democratic governor, I say the same.
I’d like to imagine that somewhere, someone writing a column “Socially Conservative, Fiscally Conservative” had the same experience hearing about Laura Kelly in Kansas that I did hearing about Charlie Baker — that they could table their differences for a term of productive collaboration.
That would bolster my hopes for a bipartisan, progressive future.

It’s 10:37 p.m. on a Thursday night. You’ve got a paper due at 5 p.m. tomorrow.
But what are you doing? You’re staring at the soulless white rectangles of your Harvard College Gmail Inbox, each one holding a dizzyingly disparate message. Each vies for your attention.
“CALLING ALL DJSs!!!” screams one.
“nature walk report,” mutters another, all the more mysterious in its modesty.
“BrainJuice Alpha GPC Brain… Get the Focused Energy everyone is raving about,” reads some junk mail, because of that one freaking time you decided to look up Yerba Mate shots. You hoped the Brazilian herb would act as an adequate caffeine replacement since you felt your intestines disintegrating due to all the coffee you’d been chugging. Now the tentacles of this dystopian corporation will forever force you into the grasp of all-natural, earthy energy boosters. You guess it’s fine.
DrawNames.com warns you it’s “that time of year again” to hold a Secret Santa, even though November just began. You flashback to freshman year, when you sent a GroupMe message about organizing an entryway Secret Santa that received only two likes.
As you look at the yellow tab next to every single one of your emails, you think to yourself: How did all of these get marked as important? 
Why Can’t I Keep My Inbox In Order?
The above scenario is a classic case of the Harvard “Omg hiii, how are you? I’m dying” Inbox, where the impulsive, gusto-filled flourishes of your pen on paper at activities fairs come back to haunt you for the rest of your college experience.
Really, who can blame you? You just loved the feeling of that cheap, almost dried-up pen, unevenly distributing ink as it wheezed its last breaths and dragged itself across that warm, newly printed sign-up sheet. Yes, it was all about flexing your scheduling prowess, and you left the “.edu” off your email address to show your deep self-assurance: a yes, my inbox can surely handle the extra 10 emails a week I’ll get from this list. I’m hip; I’m with it.
But then suddenly the fair was over, the bright yellow lights of Ticknor Lounge melted into a distant reverie, and you were only left with the consequences of saying “Oh yeah, I’ll sign up” to a club sport when you’ve never touched a tennis ball in your life. At your core, you’re just a people person who loves returning the smile of expectant fellow students sitting behind tables, a people-pleaser, a mover, a shaker, the kinda guy who ba-da-bing ba-da-booms their way through life.
But right now, your eyes keep darting to the number in the thousands next to the word “Inbox.” The words “LAST CHANCE” in every other subject line is making you feel existential.
You just want some guidance. I’m here to tell you: This is not CS50. This is the Life-Changing Magic of Deleting Your Emails.
Delete First, Think Later
It’s time to bring order to your life. You’ll feel the whole world bloom around you with new possibility. Trust me, I know. I personally have benefitted from this process of achieving peace. Visualize your perfect inbox. That’s right. Can you see it? Instead of the borderline opaque white rectangles, picture that peaceful light grey: a wall of read emails.
Imagine that peaceful grey light filling you and lifting you up and away, beyond the invites to club sport mixers for teams you never joined and Parks and Rec gifs of Aziz Ansari telling you to “treat yo self” so that a club official can express their excitement to see you on Thursday night and the [Leverett bunny-banter] list with cryptically urgent requests to borrow lab coats within the “next few hours.”
There are two steps to eliminate the clutter of your inbox. One, identify it. Two, zap it out of existence.
My Journey 
This is the path I took. This is how I used the life changing magic of tidying-up to create an uncluttered joy for myself in my virtual space.
It was late one night, and, as the vicious blue light from my laptop screen sliced my corneas, I sat in a state of glazed indecision. My hand trembled as it approached the mousepad — I couldn’t bring myself to even click on a single email. But suddenly! An epiphany!
Why did I feel as though I was constantly forced into a cycle of inescapable unethical consumption of my email inbox, into a life filled with infinite scrolling and no action? I realized — my inbox is capitalism. It was this pernicious, pacifying, and unyielding structure that was preventing my ascent.
With every advertisement, my inbox yelled “FREE” or “REWARDS” or “MERCHANDISE” or “Make Money, Get Turnt.” In the market of Harvard commodities, I was just another cog in the machine.
It was a sensory overload and it needed to change. How does one go about dismantling the system? I figured I should delete the most egregious representations of excess. I didn’t just come out of the womb in this way, with thousands of unread emails.
Gmail had hidden the tools of revolution deep in its settings section. I heard the call of the workers and found myself drawn to the grey gear button representing the machinations of capitalism.
Aha! After tirelessly searching through its contents, I found it. Here was the unassuming box that would change everything, titled “Has the words.”
Has the words… has the words! These were the whispers of communitarian change, the covert, conspiratorial exclamations of uprising and revolt.
In it, I typed my first search term: “consulting.” I knew what I did next had the power to topple the hegemonic disorder of my inbox.
“When a message arrives that matches this search…” Gmail started expectantly.
“Delete it,” I answered defiantly.
I felt a feeling I had never felt before. Was it regret?
No, this was a much more positive feeling. This was the workers of the world uniting behind me, cheering me on with every additional phrase of the capitalists I directed Gmail to find.
I was part of a new vanguard, creating a digital utopia within my Gmail inbox.
Now “consulting” wasn’t enough. I rapidly typed “meet recruiters,” into the box, the quick taps of my keyboard harkening the imminent demise of The System.
Another automatically-deleting filter created. Then, “HCCG” and “HFAC.”
Now, no silly email could tell me to find a job in finance or discover an “ideal combination of work and play.” No email could try to play down its Linkedin-in-real-life networking event with the word “Informal” capitalized before it.
As I typed, the status quo crumbled around me — I was Leo DiCaprio waking from his dream worlds in Inception. As I destroyed the illusions of my email inbox, the material world around me shook with possibility. Euphoria struck — goodbye “career panels” and “quant finance” and “cryptoassets!”
Yet removing these most clear examples of the market economy was not enough. The words of the bourgeoisie were still closing in on me. This must have been how the sheep of 16th-century England felt as they were enclosed on private lands.
That’s it! I am the sheep, I thought. I wanted to break free of this system. Why didn’t the sheep just eat the hedges that separated them from each land-owner? I would eliminate the hedges. “IM points?” Now that’s about capital. No, I won’t become an alienated laborer for you and your system of getting me to “throw a frisbee well” and to “beat Dudley.” How dare you establish a hierarchies of houses?
Gmail, delete all emails with the words “IM points.”
Gmail, delete all emails with the words, “You’ve got a package in the package room!” I don’t want to be reminded of my previous engagement with this system of degradation.
Today, I’ve told you how to change your life. Real life begins now with usurping both clutter and capitalism for a sparkling, clutter-free inbox.
Who knows what kinds of new spaces for bliss you’ve created in your online space. Revel in your freedom to actually read those repeated emails from your advisors asking to meet. Maybe now you can fill out a single survey desperately sent over [Leverett bunny-banter] at 2:43 am.
In sum, you’ve been adding too much, my friend. It’s time to delete your emails and disobey the system. Delete everything.

In 1936, Harvard students climbed what was, at the time, “the highest summit attained by man.” Four men from the Harvard Mountaineering Club, founded in 1924, joined forces with British mountaineers to ascend Nanda Devi. At 25,660 feet, it is the highest peak located entirely in what was then British-colonized India.
The Harvard men were “accompanied by 60 porters, including six veteran Sherpas from Darjeeling,” an article in the 1939 Harvard Mountaineering journal reports. “37 of the local porters deserted, forcing a further reduction in weight of supplies… A base camp was established,” the article states. “Here all the porters, save for the six Sherpas, were dismissed. The final attack began...”
As described in the article, the porters came along to assist with the climb. When the hikers ascended to glory, however, they shed the dead weight. The summit was to be the white man’s alone.
The journal observes, “The fact that the white members of the party were forced to carry 60 pound loads over very difficult country for 10 days did not appear to have ill effects on their subsequent climbing effectiveness at high altitudes.”
***
Adams House’s Claverly Hall hides a well-kept secret. Above a long hall with dark wood doors hangs a sign reading “Washburn Gallery.” The corridor holds gallery-quality, framed black-and-white photographs of snowy peaks — bleak, beautiful summits. Swaths and dips of snow and rock, empty, humanless.
At the end of this hallway sits an oblong room packed with beige couches: the Harvard Mountaineering Club headquarters. Washburn Gallery is named after Bradford Washburn, a member of the club who, in the 1930s, made the group a giant in the mountaineering world. The journals and scrapbooks of the club are riddled with his signature and his photographs. Washburn remained involved with the club long after graduating Harvard, and his shadow lingers today.
In the corner is a mock Patagonia tote-bag that says Patagucci. Red, green, blue Tibetan prayer flags are strung across the ceiling, hanging limp. “These were all brought back by members of the club,” club president Vladislav I. Sevostianov ’19 says. “These were not bought on Amazon. These are the real thing.”
The room is ringed with bookshelves. The leather-bound mountaineering narratives and volumes of Alpine Journals stand in stark contrast to glossy National Geographic magazines, their patterning almost like wallpaper in relief. A few Pabst Blue Ribbon cans rest empty on the table.
The Harvard Mountaineers have met in Claverly every Thursday at 8 p.m. since the 1960s. When former members come by to regale current students with old tales, as they often do, Sevostianov explains, they don’t need help finding the meeting. Thursday at 8, just like always.
Some things, however, have changed.
When it was founded in 1924, the Harvard Mountaineering Club was a club for rich, white men. Climbing gear is wildly expensive, and early club members paid for their own equipment out-of-pocket. Sevostianov says this is why Harvard logged so many first ascents. These men felt the world at their feet. Distant peaks proved alluring targets. In the 19th century, the Harvard mountaineer held a potent mixture of confidence, entitlement, and means.
These days, the club gives financial aid to those request it, no questions asked. They’ve accumulated their own stash of gear, which members can use free of charge. Sevostianov’s vision for the club’s future is one of accessibility. Recently, the club was forced to increase the cost of a popular trip from $150 to $200. Sevostianov wants to make mountaineering more open and affordable, which he says is difficult when the club’s funding comes from a variety of unreliable sources.
***
The inaugural issue of the club’s journal, published in 1927, reads, “Already movements are on foot in at least two other colleges in the country to found similar clubs... and it should be a source of satisfaction to Harvard men to feel that once again, even if in this small way, Harvard has been able to take the lead.”
“A lot of the mountain ranges in Alaska are actually named by people in the club.” Sevostianov tells me. “That’s one of the cool things about mountaineering — when you climb something first you actually get to name it.”
There is something about the vocabulary of mountaineering that evokes domination, possession, and violence. Consider, for example, one 1936 article in The Times of India titled “The Assault on Nanda Devi” in which the language of warfare continues throughout the piece. Another article that year in a Singaporean newspaper was headlined “Highest Peak in Empire Conquered.” Assault, conquer. Possess.
Sevostianov says traditional names still garner respect. “Generally, within climbing, there’s a respect for indigenous names,” Sestianov says. “For example: Denali, formerly Mount McKinley. Climbers have always referred to it as Denali… I think true climbers will try to go for the traditional names.”
At Harvard, the legacy of the school’s mountaineering greats is far from gone. It lingers heavy in the air, present in the gallery we enter and in the books that line the walls. The fascination with trailblazing, with “discovery,” still persists in the club, which can sometimes romanticize the political history of mountaineering.
The radiant confidence of these men is hard to scrub from the club’s culture. Still, Sestianov says the club is determined to look at things differently. “You can’t conquer a mountain, you can’t assault a mountain,” he says. “You can survive a mountain, at best. Mountains are more than we are, they’ll always be more than we are.”

The high-stakes and high-profile Harvard admissions trial may stretch well into 2019, per new details announced in a Wednesday court order.
The trial, the latest development in a four-year-old lawsuit brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, kicked off in a Boston courthouse on Oct. 15 and wrapped up three weeks later on Nov. 2. But it's not entirely over — per the court order, Judge Allison D. Burroughs will hear an additional set of arguments from both Harvard and plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions on Feb. 13.
The University and anti-affirmative action advocacy group SFFA will also file several new sets of documents in court in December and January. Wednesday's court order did not detail the exact substance of the slated filings.
Burroughs will consider new information presented in the hearing and filings as she prepares to deliver a final ruling some time in the next few months. She is the only judge working on the case, which she heard without a jury.
SFFA first brought suit against Harvard four years ago, charging that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The suit alleges that Harvard's admissions officers systematically assign qualified Asian Americans lower personal scores in order to unfairly deny them admission. Harvard has vehemently rejected these allegations and has argued its race-conscious admissions policies are necessary to achieve diversity in its student body.
The trial may have far-reaching implications for the future of affirmative action in the United States. Experts have said that, whatever Burroughs decides, the disappointed party will likely appeal until the case reaches the Supreme Court. If the suit comes before the nation's highest court, the newly conservative body is likely to rule for SFFA, perhaps imperiling race-conscious admissions in America.
Documents unearthed during the trial — as well as hundreds of hours of testimony from top Harvard administrators — shone a spotlight on previously secret details of the College's admissions process. These details included information about how the College gives special consideration to the children of donors and what factors cause admissions officers to give the nod to certain applicants — while hitting pause on others.
The next set of filings is expected to come on Dec. 19. Attorneys for SFFA and Harvard have agreed the submissions should total 75 pages or fewer. The lawyers will then submit rebuttals to each others’ filings on Jan. 23.
The court order also states that outside parties can again submit amicus briefs, which are due Jan. 9.

Robert J. Wood, a Harvard professor of engineering and applied sciences, won the Max Planck-Humboldt Medal last week for his innovations in soft robotics, a subfield of robotics that explores how flexible materials can be used to build robots able to interact with humans and thrive in natural environments.
The medal, awarded jointly by German research organization Max-Planck-Gesellschaft and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, comes with 60,000 Euros in prize money — or around $68,000.
“The selection committee – and myself – were truly impressed by Robert Wood as one of the absolute leaders in the field of micro- and soft robotics worldwide, who manages to continuously push the boundaries of this relatively new, emerging, and very promising field of research,” Max-Planck President Martin Stratmann wrote in an emailed statement. “His work on bioinspired robots made of soft materials has the potential to revolutionize many fields.”
Wood and his teams at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have worked to develop functional artificial muscles, robots that can handle fragile specimens, and biomedical soft robots to use in surgery, among other projects.
“Robots tend to be very very good in constrained regularly shaped environments like warehouses or factory floors, but if you start to put one in a more natural setting, it often fails,” Wood said in an interview. “Soft robotics comes into play to try to get more natural adaptability to unstructured natural environments.”
The medal’s selection committee specifically acknowledged Wood and his team’s creation of "RoboBees": small, robotic bees that mimic the flight of real ones, designed for potential use in disaster relief and agriculture.
Wood now has the opportunity to continue his research in Germany; one goal of the Max Planck-Humboldt awards is to foster collaboration between German and international scientists.
“Basic research is an investment into our future, carrying forward the science of tomorrow,” German Federal Research Minister Anja Karliczek wrote in a press release announcing the award. “It enriches our society in many ways: It increases our knowledge and is the seed for ideas and innovations of the future.”
Wood said he is now looking to work with soft robotics expert Oliver Brock at the Technical University of Berlin on soft robots that mimic the nuances of human dexterity.
These robots could eventually give customers five-star treatment, Wood said.
“For example, you might want a robot to be able to unpack your groceries and then make you dinner, or move patients around in a hospital bed and then be able to feed them,” Wood said.
Wood said he is honored to receive the award and sees it as a good indicator of the progress of soft robotics, which he called a “relatively new, young field.”
“I think it speaks to that coming of age, being respected as a very important set of topics to explore within robots, with a lot of not just academic potential, but also potential translational impact as well,” Wood said.

Based partly on its poll of the student body last week, the Harvard College Open Data Project has predicted Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Julia M. Huesa ’20 will win the 2018 Undergraduate Council presidential election. Voting for the election ends Thursday at noon.
The Open Data Project — a student-faculty collaboration that conducts statistical analyses of campus-related data sets — has correctly predicted the results of the past two UC presidential elections.
This year, three tickets are vying for the Council’s highest posts: Palaniappan and Huesa, Nadine M. Khoury ’20 and Arnav Agrawal ’20, and Daniel K. Ragheb ’20 and Samyra C. Miller ’21. A fourth ticket, John T. Ball ’20 and Sabrina Wu ’21, dropped out of the race but remain on the ballot and are included in the Open Data Project's findings.
The Open Data Project polled students over the course of five days last week on how they planned to vote. Of 264 respondents, roughly 52 percent said they planned to vote for Palaniappan and Huesa, 27 percent said they would vote for Ragheb and Miller, and 15 percent said they supported Khoury and Agrawal. Ball and Wu garnered the remaining 6 percent of respondent votes.
Huesa and Palaniappan led among students hailing from every class year, though their edge among freshmen — they earned 47 percent of first-place votes as compared to the 35 percent earned by Ragheb and Miller — was not as commanding as their lead among upperclassmen. Dasha Metropolitansky '22, Manasi Maheshwari '21, and Olivia K. Bryant ’21 worked on the analysis for the Open Data Project this year.
Given freshmen typically vote in higher numbers than do students in other class years, the Open Data Project weighted its polling data according to the assumption that freshmen would comprise roughly 43 percent of this year’s electorate, according to Bryant.
The weighted polling data leaves Palaniappan and Huesa still in the lead, though by a slightly smaller margin.
The Council’s newly adopted voting method could potentially induce some undergraduates to vote in a more strategic manner this year, Bryant said. Under the new system, each candidate receives a quantity of points corresponding to their ranking on the ballot — first-choice tickets receive one point, second-choice tickets receive 0.5 points, and third-choice tickets receive 0.33 points. This means that, hypothetically, a ticket with enough second-place votes could overcome a ticket with more first-place votes.
It is unclear, though, whether many students know about the new voting method and have adjusted their picks accordingly. Bryant said the Open Data Project's polling data indicated the new system has not registered with many voters.
“It’s clear that strategic voting is not happening,” she said.
The Open Data Project also analyzed each ticket’s social media presence by counting the number of Facebook likes on their official pages.
As of Sunday evening, Ragheb and Miller held a slight lead over Palaniappan and Huesa in that metric. Khoury and Agrawal trailed significantly.
Bryant said that, among the endorsements received by the candidates and analyzed by the Open Data Project, Palaniappan and Huesa held the advantage, garnering the endorsement of the Harvard Democrats and The Crimson's Editorial Board, among other groups. The Crimson's Editorial and News Boards do not coordinate coverage and maintain a strict separation in both staff and management.
In the past, the Open Data Project has also included endorsements given by UC representatives in its election analyses. Bryant said that, given the inconclusive predictive value of these endorsements, the group decided not to include them in this year’s iteration.
Official results for the election will be released Thursday at 10 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small group of students gathered to hear female politicians and experts discuss how women fare in Massachusetts politics at a Harvard panel Wednesday afternoon.
The panelists included Mass. Rep. Denise Provost and Rep-Elect Nika C. Elugardo, both Democrats, along with Executive Director of Massachusetts Women’s Political Caucus Laurie Martinelli and Northeastern Political Science Professor Eileen L. McDonagh. Each shared her own experience and encouraged more women to run for office.
Sparsha Saha, Ph.D. candidate and Expository Writing preceptor for “Sexism in Politics,” organized the event.
Panelists said last week’s midterm elections made them feel cautiously optimistic about the outlook for women in politics.
“Women voted in historic numbers, and women ran for office in historic numbers,” Martinelli said. “The recent turnout is very inspiring. We must be optimistic.”
Provost and Elugardo said they each faced unique challenges as women running for office in a historically male-dominated field. Provost said she first ran for office in 1993, causing her to realize politics can be “a pretty rough occupation” dominated by “a boys’ network.”
“After I was first elected, I had nails spread across my driveway,” she said. “Park rangers and managerial staff in buildings will call you ‘Honey’ or ‘Dear’ to remind you of your place. You’re frequently asking yourself, ‘Am I going to be the person who objects to this stuff?”’
Elugardo said she received less direct backlash than the women before her, gesturing in thanks to Provost. But she said people still treated her differently due to her gender during her campaign.
“I didn’t really think about running as a woman at first, which is a privilege that I have had thanks to the amazing women that came before me,” she said. “But certain things would happen to me along the way, and then I’d remember that I was being seen not just as a candidate, but as a female candidate.”
Elugardo said she felt that she was always being watched.
“Men on the trail would often want to touch me or engage with me in ways that were sexualized,” she said.
Provost said she can relate to Elugardo’s nervousness about being watched.
“Politics is a performing art,” she said. “Because of this, I act unrattled, even if I am feeling rattled.”
Both candidates said they think adversity taught them and those around them — including their families — valuable lessons about life.
“Both times I found nails in my driveway, I had both my daughters there with me. I realized: what a great teaching moment to show your daughters that when somebody throws nails in your driveway, you pick them all up and you ignore them,” Provost said. “You must continue onward with everything you can.”
Each panelist said they feel hopeful for the future but cautioned students to remember what they called the problematic history of gender and racial inequality that still plagues the United States, including Massachusetts. McDonagh said women must empower other women.
“Next time you’re near Boston Common, on one of the streets that borders the Common, you’ll be near the old headquarters of the Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Woman,” McDonagh said. “Women must pull other women forward.”
“We never, as a nation, have really renounced racism and hate as a way of life,” Elugardo added. “We must face this pain to allow ourselves to heal.”
Ryan V. Sears ’22 said he enjoyed the diversity of thought represented by the panelists.
“Each offered a unique perspective,” Sears said. “We had an academic perspective, older and newer representatives, and someone operating in an interest group.”
This “Women, Politics, and MA” panel forms part of a larger effort within the Expository Writing program — in partnership with the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship — to focus on topics relevant to current Harvard students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Commander of the United States Strategic Command John E. Hyten ’81 urged American leaders to continue deterring the country’s adversaries from using nuclear weapons at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Wednesday.
IOP Resident Fellow John O. Noonan moderated the talk, which touched on subjects ranging from cybersecurity to the militarization of space to efforts to modernize nuclear infrastructure.
Hyten’s talk comes amid heightening nuclear tensions. The Trump administration threatened last month to withdraw from a bilateral treaty with Russia banning short and intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Earlier this week, satellite images showed North Korea is attempting to develop a long-range nuclear missile despite American efforts to quell the country’s nuclear program.
Hyten said strong American nuclear capabilities would deter adversaries from taking military action and help secure nuclear peace.
“You don’t want to fight a nuclear war,” he said. “And if each side understands that they have ready, available forces, they won’t cross that line.”
He said he is concerned by American adversaries’ increasing investment in nuclear weapons programs over the past several decades. He pointed to Russia and China’s recent increases in military spending.
These kinds of investments could pose military threats to the U.S. in the future, Hyten said, and could cause the U.S. to fall behind other nations in military capability. He urged the U.S. to “invest as a nation in these capabilities,” while maintaining diplomatic efforts to reduce the number of nuclear missiles around the world.
For Hyten, though, cutting spending on the nuclear program without significant diplomatic progress could be detrimental to the country’s security.
“If you want to save money, change the threat,” he said. “Don’t change our level of security in this country, change the threat.”
He said that, above all, America should remain prepared for any nuclear conflict that might arise.
“Wars won’t be eliminated,” he said. “But I don’t want them to go without overwhelming superiority.”
Alisha Anand, a Tufts University graduate student who studies nuclear policy and who attended the event, said it was “really fascinating to understand how the U.S. military is thinking about the future of nuclear deterrence.”
Elizabeth G. Herington ’20, another attendee who participates in Harvard’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, praised Hyten’s focus on preventing escalation of tensions.
“The military is here to protect us and to prevent anything bad from ever happening, as opposed to this threatening role that I think that it often gets painted as,” she said. “I think that his emphasis on how we need to have these capabilities so that we never have to use them was really interesting.”

Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 unveiled a new building slated to house several clinics, programs, and faculty offices at a reception early last week.
Harvard’s Alex Krieger, a professor at the Graduate School of Design, designed the building. Located at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Everett Street, the edifice is the first at the school to be designed by Krieger’s company, NBBJ.
Krieger has taught at Design School since 1977 and has led several university-wide architecture projects. He served as the senior planning advisor for Harvard’s expansion into Allston.
Krieger said his team sought to design a building that was not just a reflection of its domineering counterpart across the street — the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall.
“The Law School itself wanted to produce a building that, while distinguished and representative of Harvard, looked like it fit into the neighborhood,” Krieger said.
Krieger added that he hopes the new building will be more welcoming to those who seek aid at the various legal clinics inside — including the Health Law and Policy Clinic, the Access to Justice Lab, and the Criminal Justice Institute.
“Some people find it kind of uncomfortable to enter into this monumental Law School building,” Krieger said of Wasserstein. He added that some passersby may feel like “they would somehow be made to be small.”
D. James Greiner, a Law professor and Faculty Director of the Access of Justice Lab, said he is excited to move out of Wasserstein and into the much-needed new space. The new building is in part meant to accommodate the tremendous growth of clinical learning programs in recent years.
“We’re currently in two different, small, basement offices, so the new office space is welcome,” Greiner wrote in an email. “We work with about 60 law, undergraduate, and graduate students at any one time, so the meeting spaces the new building offers are also quite welcome.”
Representatives from the other programs and clinics did not respond to requests for comment.
Manning said he feels enthusiastic about the new space in an emailed statement Wednesday.
“Our new building is designed to be a hub of collaboration and energy,” Manning wrote. “As home to important clinics and pro bono and research programs, it reflects the school’s commitment to innovation, deep learning, collegiality, and service.”

When Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced he would step down from the nation’s highest court over the summer, President Donald Trump already had a ready-made list of replacements at his disposal.
The list of 25 conservative judges raised questions and sparked headlines about the organization whose members were heavily involved in crafting the list: the Federalist Society.
White House counsel Donald McGahn and Leonard A. Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, curated the roster of prominent right-wing judges. Leo took a leave from his day job to advise Trump on the Supreme Court nomination. McGahn is also linked to the Federalist Society, which features him prominently on its website as a contributor.
The Federalist Society, a conservative and libertarian organization designed to counter “orthodox liberal ideology” within the American legal system, has built a sizable web of chapters in cities and law schools across the U.S. — including at Harvard Law School. The group's website dubs the branching connections "a conservative and libertarian intellectual network that extends to all levels of the legal community."
The Federalist Society's mission is ambitious: to shift the priorities of American lawyers and to reshape the American judiciary. The society’s influence on Republican presidents’ Supreme Court picks became impossible to ignore when Trump nominated conservative judge Brett M. Kavanaugh in July.
Kavanaugh, who taught a course on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School, had received a stamp of approval from Leo — and Trump chose him from the list Leo and McGahn provided. He was ultimately confirmed as a Supreme Court justice in October 2018.
Kavanaugh’s confirmation process temporarily stalled after several women levied allegations of sexual assault against the then-nominee, roiling the nation and raising questions about how Americans can and should evaluate stories of misconduct. But it also raised questions about the politicization of American courts today — and the Federalist Society’s role in establishing that politicization.
In an interview with NPR, Amanda Hollis-Brusky — a Pomona College political science professor who wrote a book on the Federalist Society — said that, though Leo was the main architect behind Trump's list, the Federalist Society at large is responsible, too.
“That list is in many ways a product of the Federal Society [sic] and its network,” she said.
The national organization has become a pipeline for conservative judges and a major force in American conservatism — and Harvard Law School alumni are some of its most prominent players.
In the Trump era, though, the Harvard Law chapter is maintaining its distance from the controversial president. Instead, the group is centering its focus on campus and on providing a space for students who find themselves at odds with Harvard’s liberal-leaning legal luminaries.
In 1982, a group of conservative law students at Harvard, Yale, and the University of Chicago founded the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy to differentiate themselves from the elite law schools they attended.
The mission of the founders remains the same today: “reforming the current legal order.” According to its website, the Federalist Society is “committed to the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.”
The student division of the society includes more than 10,000 law students with chapters at all 204 American Bar Association-accredited law schools across the country, according to the society’s website.
The national society works with the various law school chapters in a number of ways, providing speakers for forums and organizing lectures and debates.
“The Federalist Society's national office assists law school chapters to invite speakers to discuss and debate ideas that are otherwise not often heard on law school campuses and can advise students professionally when they seek such advice,” Federalist Society President Eugene B. Meyer wrote in an email.
Though it started as a student organization, the Federalist Society today includes law school faculty and lawyers as well. Over 65,000 legal professionals make up the Lawyers Division, and local chapters can be found in 90 American cities.
One Harvard Law School alumnus — the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who graduated from the Law School in 1960 — served as an intellectual forefather of sorts for the society. His doctrine of originalism, a strict interpretation of the Constitution, shaped the philosophy of the Federalist Society and the judges it embraced. Scalia was the first faculty director of the society’s chapter at the University of Chicago Law School.
Law School Professor Charles Fried said that, when the society first came into being, it primarily served as a community for students who fell to the right on the political spectrum. Fried said he has been involved with the Harvard chapter for decades.
“Certainly at the outset which was in the early eighties, the Federalist Society represented not only the views or the constellation of views which were rather underrepresented, and with which I felt considerable sympathy, but also they were students who found themselves slightly embattled, and they felt a minority and they felt somewhat squeezed,” Fried said. “And so my sympathy led me to want to help them out and to further their efforts."
Throughout his many years as faculty sponsor of the Harvard chapter, Fried saw a number of conservative leaders pass through the organization as students. Current Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch joined the group while attending the Law School in the early '90s. So did U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. And, decades before Rod Rosenstein became an embattled deputy attorney general overseeing the Russia investigation, he, too, sharpened his debate skills in the club’s ranks.
Harvard Law has long maintained substantial ties to the Federalist Society — but in light of Trump’s judicial nominations, those ties are causing some discomfort in Cambridge.
Harvard Law School is known for its left-leaning ideological bent. Ninety-eight percent of faculty political donations between 2011 and 2014 went to Democratic causes, and a number of Law professors have spent time in Washington working in Democratic administrations.
At Harvard, the Federalist Society has long served as a haven for conservative students who feel their values and beliefs are underrepresented in Cambridge. Annika M. Boone, third-year Law student and president of the Harvard Federalist Society, said the chapter mainly focuses on bringing in speakers for debates.
“First and foremost, we’re a debating society,” Boone said. “Those were our earliest roots when we got founded, gosh, about 40 years ago.”
In keeping with this tradition, Boone said the group typically brings in one speaker every week. Their guests include prominent attorneys and judges. Many times, the event takes the form of a debate. Topics of discussion include First Amendment rights, abortion, and religious liberty.
The organization also brings members together in social settings. For Boone, the Harvard Federalist Society is home.
“There is nowhere else with such high-caliber debates, such incredible academic and professional resources, and such good friends,” she said.
Bradley J. Lingo, a 2003 Law School graduate and president of the Federalist Society’s Charlotte Lawyers Chapter, said the Harvard Law chapter offered a forum for him to explore conservative legal thought.
“What it meant for me is, a kid who had come from a small, Christian college in the Midwest was offered an immediate support network both academically and socially and an avenue to explore my intellectual interests in conservative, legal scholarship which wasn’t something that was readily available at the time at Harvard,” Lingo said.
Lingo’s feelings about the Law School’s liberal leanings harken back to the reason students formed Harvard's Federalist Society chapter in the first place. Thirty-six years after its founding, chapters at law schools across the nation continue to foster camaraderie between conservative students. But as the profile of the national organization has grown — and, in recent years, become associated with the current occupant of the White House — Harvard members are seeking to promote their chapter’s openness to students of all ideological backgrounds, even those who do not agree with Trump.
“Membership is open to all,” Meyer wrote in his email.
Boone said that part of the training chapter presidents receive from the Federalist Society's national parent group encourages them to open their respective chapters to people holding a variety of beliefs.
“There’s a conference that they take every chapter president in the country to in D.C. over the summer, and they talk to us about the importance of making sure that we are representing people across the ideological perspective,” Boone said.
Even with a diverse range of beliefs, Boone said she has heard people complain about the society and equate them with the Trump administration.
“It’s not very fair,” she said. “We certainly don’t have anything to do with the Trump administration.”
Boone said many have tried to tie the Harvard Federalist Society to Kavanaugh’s nomination. She said the chapter does not endorse political candidates or judges.
“We don’t take a stance on that. I can personally say that a lot of students came down on a lot of different places on that,” she said. “But a lot of people did act as if we had picked Judge Kavanaugh and as if we all wanted him to get through and there’s not one voice of Fed Soc. That’s not how we work.”
Still, the national organization wields significant influence over lower court nominations. Hollis-Brusky told NPR the Federalist Society has successfully pushed many of Trump’s judicial appointments.
“When you look at his list of judges and the people that he's put on the bench, it's been entirely controlled by the Federal Society,” Hollis-Brusky said in the interview. “And that is an indicator of the pull that the Federal Society has within that space, that Trump wouldn't dare nominate someone who was just a family friend.”
Boone said the Harvard chapter has no connection to the work on the national level — and Lingo maintained that the organization is nonpartisan.
“First and foremost, I think there’s a misconception out there that the Federalist Society is some sort of a partisan organization that supports a particular political party or candidates for political office or judicial office. It doesn’t,” Lingo said.
Fried said he has found the ways the group's national leaders have recently waded into politics disturbing.
“I am distressed by the fact that the national organization has allowed itself to become pretty much an adviser to the Trump administration,” Fried said.
Still, the organization remains a powerful pipeline from law schools to the heights of the American judiciary system.
“Informally, folks would graduate and they’d go on to get judicial clerkships, there’d be a natural network to network through and meet folks when we were applying for clerkships,” Lingo said.
When conservative judges come to campus to give talks, post-lecture mingling can forge lasting connections.
“There’d be some informal opportunities to connect with or network with those judges when they were on campus debating a professor or giving a talk,” Lingo said.
The network leading from classrooms to the courts might one day land current students on a list for a Supreme Court nomination, like Leo and McGahn’s. That list included two Harvard Law graduates: Robert P. Young Jr. ’74 and Kevin C. Newsom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 8:11 to go in the third quarter, captain Sydney Skinner missed a three pointer from the right wing but then quickly grabbed her own rebound and made a flashy touch pass to sophomore forward Jadyn Bush. Bush finished the basket, got fouled, and completed the three-point play as the crowd erupted.
Skinner’s heads-up play was representative of Wednesday night’s contest between Harvard and La Salle. The Crimson always seemed to be one step ahead, trouncing the Explorers 86-43 in Cambridge.
Immediately off of the opening tip, La Salle (0-3) scored an easy layup to open up the scoring at Lavietes Pavilion. A few possessions later, sophomore guard Rayshel Brown overpowered junior guard Katie Benzan for the offensive rebound and layed it back in for two.
At this point, the Explorers led 4-2, but the winds shifted drastically soon after. Benzan quickly redeemed herself on the other end of the court, drilling a three from the top of the key to take the lead. From that moment on, Harvard (1-2) did not look back.
The team went on a blistering run to take control of the game, at one point leading 33-6.
The home team’s domination was highlighted by some eye-catching plays. Benzan, after fumbling to pick up a loose ball, delivered a pass from half court to junior forward Jeannie Boehm under the basket for two.
However, defense really fueled the Crimson’s run. Double-teaming a La Salle player in the post allowed the group to force a steal and get out in transition. The beneficiary of this play was Bush, who scored the layup.
“We love being on our home court, we play well here,” Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We are a very good shooting team. I have probably the best three point shooting threats we’ve ever had.”
The Explorers ended a 15-0 run with a hook shot in the lane, but Harvard’s response was a decisive one. Back-to-back three pointers from Skinner, followed by yet another triple from sophomore forward Rachel Levy, maintained the group’s momentum.
This dominant play continued in the second quarter. Yet again, Harvard’s defense stepped up to match its offense. A block by Boehm got the home bench to its feet and served as an exclamation point for the team’s defensive performance thus far.
The end of the second quarter featured little scoring, as both sides held the other in check. At the break, the Crimson took a 38-14 lead into the locker room.
La Salle came into the third frame in a zone defense, hoping to throw off Harvard’s rhythm. With six minutes left in the quarter the Explorers went on a mini run of their own. After picking off an inbounds pass, they quickly pushed the ball up the floor. A dish to guard Kayla Spruill resulted in a quick two for the freshman.
On the next Harvard possession the team settled for, and missed a three pointer. Again La Salle hurried the ball up the floor. This time a lapse in communication left freshman guard Shayla Sweeney wide open behind the arc, who made the Crimson pay.
This sparked a timeout from Delaney-Smith in order to halt the momentum shift. The tactic worked, as the team began to impose itself again.
This was especially true when it came to the offensive glass. Repeated efforts to secure offensive rebounds gave Harvard several second chance opportunities.
Bush provided a clearcut example of this. She tore down the rebound from her own miss, quickly putting the ball back up and in over the outstretched hands of an Explorer defender.
Good ball movement allowed sophomore forward Maddie Stuhlreyer to bank in a shot from the block to give the Crimson a 32 point lead after three quarters.
The fourth quarter offered much of the same. Several plays displayed the ball movement that Delaney-Smith has been preaching to her team.
On one occasion Harvard worked the ball around the key then found a wide open Stuhlreyer under the basket for two. Later on, the ball was dumped into the post from the right corner then immediately kicked out to the left corner to an awaiting Maggie McCarthy. The freshman guard and Massachusetts native knocked down a three and added five more points later in the quarter.
La Salle offered some resistance but its efforts were too little, too late. A steal by the Crimson on the last possession was a fitting way for the game to reach its conclusion.
That being said, the performance was not perfect by Harvard. In order to compete at an even higher level it will need to adjust its offense a bit and limit its turnovers.
“We are trying to play really fast,” Delaney-Smith said. “We look for eight second offense. At that pace you have to give up a little accuracy to do that. We just need to find out how to balance that.”
However, plenty of time remains in the season, and now the group has its first win under its belt.
“There were a few times where we started playing down to their level,” senior guard Kelsey Bogdan said. “At the end of the day we were able to come together, pick up our energy, and get it done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I walk into the sports cube at The Crimson. I log on to the lone working computer. I open up a blank document and prepare to get going on another edition of this column.
Then I realize that I’m washed up — I’m halfway through my last week of covering Harvard’s football team.
Athletes nearing the end of their careers constantly have to weigh the option of taking one final ride toward a championship against the honor inherent in riding off into the sunset before their abilities decline and make them unrecognizable to fans. Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees represented the first, being forced into a more limited role and hampering the Yankees’ lineup after years as its star shortstop. On the other hand, David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox embodied the second type of athlete, concluding his 20-year career as one of the best hitters in the league.
As I sit here in the cube puzzling over my options, I know what has to be done. I recognize that I’m risking my reputation and career stats by continuing on with this article, but my team needs me. Let’s go Around the Ivies.
PENN AT PRINCETON
As the Tigers downed Yale last weekend to claim at least a share of the Ivy League championship, Princeton ensured that it would set a blazing Big Three bonfire — a school tradition — following the conclusion of its campaign against Penn.
On that note, I really hope Princeton doesn’t lose this week. Seriously. I usually root for underdogs, but I’m definitely not a fan of sharing championships. And, as I’ll note below, I don’t think Brown really has much reason to make the trek north to face Dartmouth and to establish an outcome that is already pretty much decided.
When the Ancient Eight officially came into being in the 1950s, it decided that ties at the top of the standings were to go unbroken and would be glorified. Gross. In an age when fans are seeing the debut of new formats such as the Ivy League Tournament for basketball (which already broke ties in the past for March Madness purposes), football fans are stuck in limbo when their teams share the claim of being top dog.
Anyway, back to the game. Penn has an enviable position this weekend as it attempts to spoil Princeton’s perfect season. In doing so, the Quakers would claim a share of the third-place spot in the conference. However, that won’t be an easy task for the following reason: the Tigers are as high-powered and energetic as a sports writer after three cans of Red Bull “The Lime Edition” (shoutout to our official/unofficial sponsor).
Princeton has not faced much adversity this season, most likely because it can handily defeat even competent opponents. It did play a competitive game against Harvard in week six, and in week eight it barely eked out a victory over Dartmouth, which is essentially team 1B to the Tigers’ 1A in the Ivy League. Last week, Princeton prevailed in its third closest game it played this season, as the Tigers “only” beat Yale by 16….
Princeton by 17
CORNELL AT COLUMBIA
Cornell might not know what it’s getting itself into this Saturday. After reading an article in the Columbia Spectator dated Nov. 7, I have no option but to conclude that Columbia students appear to be both fearless and dangerous.
Beginning on Monday of this week, University officials began searching undergraduate dorms for prohibited items. These renegade students may be harboring anything from “extension cords without surge protectors” to “electronic cigarettes.” Scary stuff.
As Harvard fans know, however, Cornell’s football team is not to be taken lightly. Its electrifying comeback against the Crimson in week four would have been enough to attract the notice of officials from Columbia Residential Life. On the other hand, I have no reason to believe that the Lions are not up to the task of challenging the Big Red — but like many (read: all) of the picks I make, I have to trust my instincts.
In response to the notice about dorm searches, and likely in response to this game on Saturday, one Columbia student was quoted as saying, “‘I thought it was kind of wack.’”
Cornell by 2.5
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
Here’s a summary of my rocky relationship with the 2018 Brown football team: I pick the Bears to upset neighbor URI in a show of solidarity after their compelling fight against Harvard, and they promptly lose by a billion. I then lose all faith in Brown, picking the team to crumble in similar fashion in all its ensuing games.
So far, I’ve been right. Since their week three victory over Georgetown, the Bears have been crushed in all their games save one: a 13-7 defeat against Penn.
But that could all change in a blink. Yes, Brown is 1-8, but if I know anything it’s that weird things happen when I’m in charge of making picks. If the Bears upset Dartmouth in this clash of one heavyweight and one extreme lightweight, I predict a curse will fall upon The Crimson’s sports board — the curse of Michael Hoecht.

THE GAME
Here we are: the end. I figured I would save the most important game of the Ivy League football calendar for the final pick of my career.
I mentioned David Ortiz earlier; while his final game in a Red Sox uniform was the cap on an ALDS sweep at the hands of the Cleveland Indians, he had an electrifying final season in Boston, batting .315 with a 1.021 OPS and 38 home runs, finishing sixth in MVP voting.
Likewise, Ted Williams closed out his career at America’s Most Beloved Ballpark in style. At 41 years old, Williams had a similar final campaign to the one that a 40-year-old Ortiz put together, and in Williams’ final at bat on Sept. 28, 1960, he launched a towering home run to right-center field.
These two Red Sox icons are forever immortalized at Fenway Park, the site of this year’s Harvard–Yale clash. The Crimson and the Bulldogs enter neck-and-neck at 5-4 overall and 3-3 in the Ivy League. The past two years, Yale has come out on top, and last year the Elis captured the Ancient Eight crown with their 24-3 pummeling of Harvard.
This will be a fitting site for my final game on the football beat, no matter the result. I think David Ortiz and Ted Williams’ cryogenically frozen head would agree: there’s nothing like going out on top at Fenway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 2 Harvard (1-0) lived up to its national ranking, opening up its 2018-2019 season with a resounding 9-0 sweep of Northeastern. Picking up on its 13-3 campaign in 2017-2018, the Crimson showed dominance within each of the nine matches as well, winning by score of 3-0 in every one.
Headlining the effort was sophomore Samuel Scherl at the No. 1 position in the Harvard lineup. Providing backup, freshman George Crowne controlled No. 2 en route to his first collegiate victory and sophomore Adam Corcoran cruised to a win at No. 3.
Complementing the talent at the top, the depth of the Crimson lineup proved just as vital to Harvard’s thorough rout. In fact, senior Rana Bansal powered his way to the most dominant performance of the day at the No.7 position.  In the course of three games, Bansal surrendered just one single point, amassing an aggregate 33-1 advantage in points. Achieving the lopsided margin, Bansal credited his game to executing the fundamentals with precision.
“I tried to just focus on my length and my shots and stick to the basics of what I knew,” Bansal said.
In keeping it simple, Bansal prioritized finesse and placement over power, leading him to cool-headed, steady rallies and setting himself up for the chance for crafty shot-making after getting into a rhythm.
Strategically, as a team, the Crimson showed great shot-making prowess in its victory. Running opponents all over the court, alternating power and finesse, and playing shots off of the walls at sharp angles, Harvard seemed to have too great a repertoire for the Huskies to handle.
When Northeastern did adjust, the Crimson responded immediately. In his triumph, senior Stephen Monrad alternated shot speed to keep his opponent on his toes.
“I started out with a lot of power. He began to get used to it. He moved back in the T, so I had to try to finish up with a little finesse,” Monrad explained.
With a win under its belt, the Crimson will look to use the complete performance as a jumping-off point to build momentum for the rest of the season. To Bansal, this match can have implications beyond just gameday.
“This is the first match — this sets the tone for the whole year,” the senior said.
Despite the hot start, Harvard is by no means satisfied. While the squad considers the match a necessary first step to a successful campaign, team members say a lot of work is still to be done.
“It’s good to get a win, but we have a long way to go to where we want to be,” Monrad explained.
Shifting focus to the rest of the season, Bansal also echoed that, in the grand scheme of the season, this match is simply a starting point for future success.
“We have a lot of big matches coming up…. This was a way to kind of get the legs moving and for guys to get warmed up and ready to go,” Bansal said.
Looking to the future, the team has no trepidation about setting lofty goals.
“The expectation: we want to be national champions,” Monrad said. “This is just one step of the way there.”
In its quest for a national championship, the Crimson will encounter one of its toughest schedule stretches after Thanksgiving but before the semester break. Harvard returns to play on Nov. 28 against Tufts before squaring off with No. 22 MIT on Nov. 30 and then No.7 Dartmouth on Dec. 5.
Wednesday night was the start Harvard wanted, but if it wants to win the national championship, the team will have to navigate its way successfully through the difficult weeks to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week into the 2018-2019 campaign, Harvard traveled to Amherst for its first road game of the season - it proved to be a test that made the 90 mile trip down Mass Pike well worthwhile for the Crimson. Harvard clung on to secure a 74-71 win over UMass, a result that Coach Tommy Amaker will hope to be the first of several solid road wins.
As road-trips to URI, the University of San Francisco, and Saint Mary’s over Thanksgiving looms large, the Crimson will look to continue searching for consistency. An impressive victory on the road was an encouraging result for a young Harvard team that is without junior stalwarts Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns.
BENCH AND BALANCE
Without Towns and with Chris Lewis coming up gimpy several times Tuesday night, players like Henry Welsh, Robert Baker, and Noah Kirkwood all saw extended court time. Their performances, coupled with solid efforts from starters Lewis, Djuricic, Juzang, Haskett, and Bassey, resulted in a team victory over the Minutemen.
While UMass’ Luwane Pipkins exploded for 36 of the team’s 71 points, the Crimson’s victory demonstrated the archetypal “bench and balance” mentality that Coach Amaker has frequently extolled.
“Yeah I mean we talk a lot about our bench and our balance,” Amaker said. “Those two B-words will be critical for our team, they have been in the past for certain teams and I think this is going to ring true for our team as we go down the stretch on the road.”
With seven players scoring six or more points apiece, it took a complete team effort to knock off the Minutemen. While no player scored more than Lewis’ 16 points, different players had crucial offensive moments throughout the game. Welsh’s first career three-pointer helped quell a UMass run, Kirkwood’s energy off the bench repeatedly galvanized Harvard, and crucial 2-for-2 efforts at the free-throw line from Juzang and Bassey in the last minute helped seal the victory.
DOWN TO THE WIRE
Tuesday night’s game at the Mullins Center was, unsurprisingly, a nail-biter that came down to the final possession of the night. A Pipkins half-court effort rattled off of the rim, allowing the visitors to breathe a sigh of relief, as Harvard improved to 2-1 on the young season.
The Crimson win was another addition to the record of spectacular basketball games between the two programs, and represented the fifth consecutive matchup decided by 2 possessions or fewer. Last season’s game was settled in equally dramatic fashion, as Aiken drilled an overtime three-pointer with 1.9 seconds remaining to give Harvard the 70-67 win.
“I think it’s great for us, I think it’s great for Harvard,” Minutemen coach Matt McCall said of the budding rivalry between the Massachusetts programs. “You know it’s always going to be a battle, and it’s a really good game to prepare us going forward for A-10 play.”
The Crimson led for all 20 minutes of the first half, and well into the second frame, but a Pipkens-inspired run by UMass cut the deficit and brought the Mullins Center crowd to its feet. Nevertheless, Harvard weathered each Minutemen run, as the hosts never led by more than one point. A combination of good free-throw shooting, rebounding, and crucial stops down the stretch helped the Crimson seal the game.
LEWIS’ LAYUPS
Through three games this season, Lewis’ impact has been unmistakable as the team searches for scoring without Towns and Aiken. The junior from Alpharetta, Ga., has scored almost 18 points per game thus far, on a ridiculous 77.4 percent shooting from the field. What’s more, the forward is only averaging 23 minutes a game, allowing him to stay fresh as Harvard eases into the season.
Lewis is the only scorer on the team averaging double-figures, and his presence on both the offensive and defensive end will be crucial if the Crimson hopes to make Ivy League, and NCAA Tournament runs.
“We play inside-out, we play through Lewis,” Amaker said. “He’s our post presence, we went to him early… it changes things when you have a guy like that that you can throw it into.”
With a sky-high shooting percentage, and with his ability to attract extra defensive attention to help free-up teammates, Lewis can afford to be even more aggressive in kick-starting the Harvard offense. For as long as Towns and Aiken remain out, the forward will be the lynchpin on the offensive end.
LOOKING AHEAD
With the road portion of the schedule underway, the Crimson will head to Kingston, R.I. this friday night for a matchup with another A-10 foe, URI. The Rams knocked off Oklahoma in the opening round of the NCAA tournament last season, before falling to Duke.
URI boasts a deep roster of talent, including junior forward Cyril Langevine. Langevine has averaged 14 points per game through the Rams’ first three games, and was a high-school teammate of Aiken’s at the St. Patrick’s school, graduating in the same year as the injured Harvard guard.
As URI looms, the Crimson will hope to rekindle the team effort it put forth Tuesday, on Friday night and beyond.
“They weren’t going to beat themselves,” said coach McCall. “Every single mistake we made, they capitalized on, and that’s what really good teams do.”
Harvard will look to continue to be a good team, emphasizing fundamental basketball. For the Crimson, if the turnovers, rebounding margin, and bench points are under control, the team can expect many more nights like Tuesday.

No one can deny that Harvard’s got some hot spots. No, we’re not talking great parties (Cabot Aquarium, we’re looking at you), we’re talking actual warm places, which have suddenly become necessary. If you’ve already started layering multiple sweaters under your Canada Goose, planning for winter, and stashing food in your dorm to avoid a chilly trek to the dhall, this article is for you.
The Barker Cafe
For some reason, the Barker Cafe is always about ten degrees hotter than any other part of the Barker center. Maybe it’s the late afternoon sun, maybe it’s all the cute Humanities people who hang out there, or maybe it’s the sandwich press heating up the rest of the room. Plus, they take Board Plus, so you can enjoy a hot beverage while you wait for your toes to thaw.
The Upper Floor of Cabot Library
Freezing cold in the summer but blissfully hot in the winter, the upper floor of Cabot Library seems like it hasn’t figured out temperature regulation yet. During the winter, that means it is the perfect place to pound out a pset and take refuge from the cold (if you can avoid dozing off, that is). Sure, the interior design leaves a little to be desired, but there are board games, private study rooms, and even a sewing machine. But be ready to peel off a sweater layer though — it’s truly a toasty study spot.
The Vent by Canaday
Stand right next to the mysterious vents by the western side of Canaday for a toasty treat. Be prepared for some strange looks, but the warm air wafting out of there can warm even the most frozen hearts. For all you poor souls who live by the river but have class by the Science Center, this vent will provide just enough warmth to keep you going on your walks to and from class.
The Steam Tunnels
Sure, these are completely off limit to students, but maybe if you ask very nicely you could sneak in for a second and finally warm up. Yes, if you haven’t heard, Harvard has over three miles of tunnels running right below your feet, and they’re kept toasty warm. Just don’t actually touch any of the piping— you’ll get a pretty nasty burn.
Your Crush’s Bed
Make sure you get an invitation to go there, but it’s wilderness survival 101 to climb into someone else’s sleeping bag to get warm. Sure, you might be a little cramped for space, and it gets a little perilous if your crush happens to have a top bunk, but we’re talking cold weather survival here!
Even if you’re not a cold, hardened senior come December, you’ll probably start feeling the chill. Check out these warm spots, warm up your feet (or your soul?), and question why you thought it was a good idea to go to school in the Northeast.

We all know that Harvard’s programming for game day has proven to be disappointing for some, but the fact remains that mooching off of the school’s food and alcohol beats receiving passive-aggressive Venmo requests from your roommate for the rest of the semester. If you’re looking for a school-sponsored place to pregame, postgame, or just to grab some free food to line your small intestine before a Burnette’s pull, check out the events the Office of Student Engagement has planned for us:
9:30-11:15 a.m. Harvard-Yale On-Campus Student Gathering
Location: Science Center Plaza
Start your Harvard-Yale morning at the Science Center Plaza, where students from both colleges will gather for food, drinks (there will be a bar for 21+ students!), and socialization before buses come to take us all to Fenway.
10-11:45 a.m. Harvard-Yale Fenway Student Gathering
Location: Ipswich Lot
If you make it to Fenway, head over to Ipswich Lot (at the corner of Ipswich and Van Ness Streets) for music, giveaways, and—of course—free food and alcohol. Then go watch the game, I guess.
Note, this is another student gathering — not a “tailgate.” (By this title, the administrators seem to expect Harvard-Yale students will hold hands in a circle singing Kumbaya.)
10 p.m.-2 a.m. Hotspot
Location: SOCH Room 104
Described as “A queer AF Harvard-Yale afterparty,” Hotspot will be hosted by the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies group (QSA) to celebrate the game finally being over. Bring your student ID to the SOCH and get ready to dance/stave off the beginning of your hangover!
No matter which events you end up going to (even if it’s none of them), Flyby wishes you a fun, safe, and successful game day!
