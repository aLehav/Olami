After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The intermission between Thanksgiving and the beginning of December is finally over – Christmas music season is officially here! While many of you may be ready to start gleefully blasting your Christmas music on repeat, others may have a bit of respect for the more Christmas-averse among us. So if you’re like me and want to preserve a little dignity in your Spotify listening activity, here are six songs that can get you into the Christmas spirit without anyone else knowing.
“All of the Lights” by Kanye West
“Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights, strobe lights, streetlights.” Christmas lights, anyone? This Yeezy track prepares everyone for the premature hanging of Christmas lights in dorms that inevitably lasts long past Winter break and probably until move-out in early summer — a.k.a. not Christmastime.
“Lover” by Taylor Swift
Speaking of leaving the Christmas lights up for an obscene stretch of time, this is exactly the type of behavior that Swift encourages in the opening lines of her single: “We could leave the Christmas lights up ‘til January.” Alongside the sneaky Christmas reference, the song also explores feeling at home and being loved, which is what the holidays are truly all about.
“Just Haven’t Met You Yet” by Michael Bublé
Name a song by Michael Bublé that isn’t Christmas music or this one. Exactly. Yes, some may have even forgotten that Michael Bublé makes music (or rather, a singular song) that isn’t Christmas themed. Bublé’s voice has become something of a classical conditioning stimulus: even if it’s not crooning the opening of “It’s Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas,” it still triggers that feeling of “I am listening to Christmas music.”
“Sweater Weather” by Pentatonix
This one is technically cheating, since this song appears on one of Pentatonix’s approximately four million Christmas albums, but lyrically there is no direct holiday reference. It’s all just cold weather and sweaters, which, if you’re doing Christmas in New England, you’re sure to encounter.
“tis the damn season” by Taylor Swift
Another Taylor Swift song! This one is also kind of cheating. As opposed to the Pentatonix entry, this is a song about Christmas on a non-Christmas album (that’s what makes it sneaky). It’s also about revisiting old romances when returning for the holidays and so, so sad. On second thought, maybe don’t listen.
“White Winter Hymnal” by Fleet Foxes
This song has been misattributed as a Christmas song thanks to, you guessed it, a Pentatonix cover, but here’s a case for why it’s not. Namely, what is it even about? The band has admitted the lyrics are relatively meaningless, and whatever meaning it could have has nothing to do with Christmas. So if anyone asks, you’re not listening to it because of how Christmas-ified acapella groups have made it. You’re listening because of the lead singer’s experience with gangs, or something.

Following the release of “Dune,” the second most essential Timothée Chalamet-related piece of news from the past two months is the discovery of his YouTube channel, ModdedController360.
Active 11 years ago, Chalamet once used the channel to post a total of three videos, all around 45 seconds to a minute in length. Each features a newly-redesigned Xbox controller of the week that Chalamet had either sold to a specified gamer or had made available for sale to his now-500K viewers, though the number is doubtlessly due, in part, to the recent rediscovery of the account by his fans. Each of these video game controllers had been modified by Chalamet himself. The camera cut is centered on Chalamet’s hands holding the week’s given controller at a desk so that only his torso is visible. Chalamet’s face is never shown.
Overall, the controllers feature strong yet simple color combinations with bold patterns. Technically, these designed controllers are decently made but not show-stopping. Using spray paint for his designs, Chalamet shows off one “Christmas-themed” red controller with a green rim and accents, one blue and silver patterned controller, and finally one red and black “tiger” striped controller. At times, especially in the latter two controllers, the paint appears in places to be somewhat shakily applied.
Turning the focus from the controllers to Chalamet’s presence in these videos, one can see an early form of Chalamet’s ability to work an audience. He engages with his viewers charismatically, earnestly asking them to subscribe to his channel and like his video. He even encourages the audience to interact on a deeper level by using the comments section to suggest new color ideas or to “make offers” on his handmade controllers.
Still, the young Chalamet that found a side gig on YouTube still has a long way to go regarding his confidence levels. He ends one video saying that he doubts users would want to buy his controllers, “but whatever.” Perhaps if Chalamet was more serious about this endeavor, he would have maintained a consistently positive attitude towards his products. After all, the purpose of this channel was to showcase, and potentially sell, his controllers to the world.
When he does make positive comments, such as saying that the controllers work perfectly or calling his controllers “sexy,” his comments come off as genuine and not forced, which adds to his likeability and credibility.
Across the videos, his engagement with the camera also varies. At times, Chalamet uses hand movements to further a viewer’s experience, flipping the controllers around so a user can see the whole design or verifying that the buttons and other elements of the controller are still functional. But at other times, his motions detract from the general viewing experience and emit nervous energy, as when Chalamet fidgets with the controllers or rapidly moves them around without cause.
Ultimately, ModdedController360’s era ends on an unfinished note. In the last video, from March 16, 2010, Chalamet teases his audience with the idea of a jet black and purple controller that he is “pretty sure” will be next week’s featured design. But the next week’s video was never uploaded.
In 2021, this channel serves as a look at a young, nervous, camera-shy Chalamet from long ago, marking a sharp contrast to the charisma and confidence he is known for today. Almost as though it were a time capsule, the videos give viewers insights into who Chalamet was before stardom, as well as an added perspective on the journey and growth he experienced as he grew from filming at his desk to filming on the set of blockbuster productions.

If it is possible to genetically engineer a film to win an Academy Award, it makes sense that Amazon is the studio attempting it — and with “Being the Ricardos,” they seem to have gotten quite close. The film, a biopic written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, is a love letter to old Hollywood; seldom is there a scene without a 35mm film camera or Unidyne microphones suspended by strings and pulleys somewhere in the shot. But beyond that, it’s an idealistic defense of actors and creators and writers and their ability to triumph over a misinformed public.
The film follows Lucille Ball (Nicole Kidman) and Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem), the real-life actors who played the eponymous Ricardos in the hit 1950s sitcom,“I Love Lucy,” as they proceed through a week of the show’s production: a table read on Monday, blocking rehearsal on Wednesday, filming on Friday, etc. Joining Lucy and Desi are, of course, their co-stars Vivian Vance (Nina Arianda) and William Frawley (J.K. Simmons — whose ability to play a grouchy yet heartfelt old man cannot be outdone), as well as the show’s writers, Jess Oppenheimer (Tony Hale), Bob Carroll (Jake Lacy), and Madelyn Pugh (Alia Shawkat).
This week, however, happens to be a particularly troublesome one for Lucy and Desi; in addition to their marriage troubles and creative control struggles with CBS, the pair face the aftermath of newspaper columnist Walter Winchell accusing Lucy of being a Communist.
It’s a packed week, one that (while not necessarily true to the timeline of real events) makes for a fast-paced narrative structure that skillfully builds tension as the film progresses. Layered on top of this structure (and here’s where Sorkin comes in) are mock interviews with “present-day” versions of the show’s writers. It’s unclear why Sorkin chooses to nest the story within these interviews (other than to open more opportunities to inject snarky quips and witty commentary), and it feels like an unnecessary addition to a film with so many moving parts — for example, Lucy’s backstory, which is told through scattered flashbacks.
These flashbacks are a highlight of the film, due in large part to the fact that Nicole Kidman’s Lucy is absolutely electric. Her performance manages to capture not only the comedic chops (Desi describes her as “kinetically gifted”) of the famous actress, but also the quiet, calculated intensity of one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Sorkin traces Lucy’s journey from her early days playing supporting roles in RKO films, to her being snubbed of a leading role in “The Big Street,” to her performance in “My Favorite Husband,” a CBS radio comedy that would ultimately turn into “I Love Lucy.”
Lucy, then, Sorkin argues, is a product of these experiences; the creative control she exercises on the “I Love Lucy” set is the result of being sidelined for so long. Every line of dialogue, the blocking of every scene — all of it is carefully picked apart by Lucy in what are the most captivating scenes in the entire film: black and white sequences where Lucy imagines the scene playing out in her head. These scenes, reminiscent of Robert Downey Jr.’s Sherlock Holmes solving a mystery, are inventive, narratively compelling, and cement Kidman’s Lucy as the star of the show.
But despite the care and nuance of Kidman’s performance, Sorkin (as Sorkin often does) cannot help but turn the character into a mouthpiece for his signature didactic social commentary. “We can’t have a pregnant woman on television,” says CBS rep Howard Wenke (Clark Gregg), teeing up Lucy to take a swing at the network’s conservative standards. “We can’t have an all-American girl married to a man who isn’t American,” says bigwig CBS executive Macy (Ron Perkins) when Lucy demands that Desi play her husband — clearing the runway for Kidman’s mic drop defense of Desi. And on and on. Sorkin fills this film with more self-congratulating progressive platitudes than a dinner party on the Upper East Side.
And ultimately, this makes for an unadventurous — in a way, quite boring — film. The climax comes when, after the evening edition of the Los Angeles Herald-Express comes out bearing the headline “LUCILLE BALL A RED,” Desi must introduce Lucy for the Friday night taping. The fate of our heroes, as Sorkin frames it, rests on whether the audience applauds when Lucy comes out — and, of course (with some help from a special guest of Desi’s), they do. A Sorkin happy ending™ straight out of “The West Wing.”
Of course, this does not make “Being the Ricardos” a bad film. Indeed, this is a film filled with beautiful production design, deftly written dialogue, and powerful performances — and not every film needs to be riddled with moral ambiguity; that is certainly not what one expects from Sorkin. And in the end, that’s what this is: it’s not Lucy’s film, nor is it Desi’s — for better or for worse, it’s Sorkin’s, through and through.

Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a conceited asshole — something that should come as no surprise considering he was a student at Yale University. In the most reductive terms, “The Power of the Dog” can be summarized as Phil waging psychological warfare for two hours. His brooding, aloof personality slowly wears down all of those around him, even pushing his sister-in-law to alcoholism. Even so, it is hard to quantify specific actions that make Phil so despicable, since much of his insolence is non-confrontational. Herein lies the true beauty of the film. “The Power of the Dog” thrives in its subtleties: the silence between words, a lingering stare, and subtle gestures.
The year is 1925. Calvin Coolidge is president. The Great War is over and flapper culture is in. And somewhere on a ranch in Montana, wealthy ranchers and brothers Phil and George (Jesse Plemons) are taking respite from a cattle drive at an inn. There, the brothers meet the family who own the inn, Rose (Kirsten Dunst) and her son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) — the former George marries, and the latter Phil harrasses. Following their wedding, Rose comes to live with George in their big, beautiful, barren mansion. Though Rose’s relationship with George remains intact, her mental stability quickly disintegrates due to Phil’s oppressive presence, and she turns to alcoholism as a result.
The Western is a genre that is so steeped in film history that it only seems to exist today as something meant to be recreated, parodied, and ultimately subverted. Some of the most prominent Westerns in recent memory, for example, all subverted genre expectations — the superhero-Western hybrid “Logan” or Tarantino’s spaghetti Western, “Django Unchained.” Although it was produced by the New Zealand Film Commission, “The Power of the Dog” leans heavily into authentic Western genre conventions. This is especially true with Campion’s apprehensive frontier visuals; her film features wide landscape shots that feel so vast and expansive that they could be displayed alongside Hudson River School paintings. However, “Power of the Dog,” is not a simple replica of the Western; rather, it subverts character archetypes — namely the hyper-masculine cowboy protagonist — to showcase a more nuanced, realistic depiction of characters in the 1920s West.
The film opens with Peter saying, “When my father passed, I wanted nothing more than my mother’s happiness. For what kind of man would I be if I did not help my mother?” This theme of masculinity is prevalent throughout the film. Phil is calloused, caked with dirt, and a most likely smelly figure — the stereotypical cowboy. He imposes this standard of masculinity on those around him, calling George “fatso” and fixating on Peter for being effeminate. Those around him are hostage to the fear that Phil imposes within them: Peter watches in seeming resignation as his mother slips deeper into the clutches of alcoholism.
The narrative develops slowly and meanders, yet a simmering tension is palpable throughout the film. That’s largely due to the film’s attention to building subtle atmospherics — conveying tension through feeling rather than dialogue. For instance, the musical score by Jonny Greenwood aids the plot to an equal extent as Phil’s wrath itself.
Moreover, Campion’s sharp direction and camera movement guide the film through the central power struggle between Phil and Rose. In a striking scene, Rose sits timidly in front of a grand piano, repeatedly trying to play the same first chord of a show tune. As she executes the chord poorly and with little confidence, a sharp disruptive sound is heard in the background — a cocky banjo expertly playing the same tune. Phil emerges from a doorway above, looking down at Rose. It’s a spatial relationship that visualizes much of their power dynamic. As Rose continues playing, the camera zooms into her and stops when she stops playing, highlighting her increasing unease and desperation. The camera becomes an agent of free will, a character in and of itself, and it oppresses the audience in the same way Phil oppresses Rose.
Through only wanting the validation of the other cattlemen around him, Phil’s preoccupation with masculinity shows an affinity to queerness. The fact that Phil is gay is never overtly stated. However, the audience is slowly led to the conclusion through a trail of breadcrumbs: Phil’s constant references to the late “Bronco” Henry and his hands caressing Bronco Henry’s saddle. By the time the audience starts suspecting Phil’s queer identity, Peter stumbles upon Phil’s magazines of nude men stowed deep away in the woods.
This realization shifts the dynamic in Phil and Peter’s relationship as the meek boy now processes decisive information that would disintegrate Phil’s carefully curated image. In a moment of self awareness, Phil changes his tone towards Peter and takes him under his wing. As the comradery between the two develops, the color palette begins to become more colorful, offering hints of optimism. Kodi Smit-McPhee is enigmatic as Peter: though he appears to grow closer to Phil, Peter never reveals much of his inner thoughts. Again, the film tells its message with subtlety — through small gestures like the camera focusing on Peter’s hands as he repeatedly runs them over his comb to produce a buzzing sound. Peter may be quiet, but his head is full of conspiratorial thoughts. Peter’s father purportedly said that he “wasn’t kind enough” and was “too strong.” Peter is by no means strong in stature, but the film’s conclusion suggests that Peter is more of an intellectual foil to Phil’s outward masculinity.
The reign of the cowboys is over, and perhaps for good reason. Phil seems to be a hallmark of a lost age. Though this chapter of the American Western is closed, “The Power of the Dog” does not slam the metaphorical book shut. No, the biggest twist of the movie is never stated. Rather, it is confirmed with a wry smile.
