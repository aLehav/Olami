After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I thought long and hard about writing this op-ed.
Truthfully, I still am not sure about this — bringing up subjects like massacres in a piece of writing always feels like I’m making a spectacle out of violence and death. But again, as a proud intended History concentrator, I suppose I am always making a spectacle out of dead people.
October 24, 2021, marks the 150th anniversary of the Los Angeles Chinatown Massacre of 1871, where a mob of around 500 white and Hispanic people entered Los Angeles’s Old Chinatown and murdered 18 Chinese people. I refuse to construct the previous sentence with the victims as the main focus because they weren’t the actors. They didn’t do anything.
As a 19-year-old who lives in the comfort of being acknowledged as American (for the most part) and a Harvard student, my Oct. 24 was mostly spent enjoying the serenity of my college campus in the fall and building up my excitement for Halloween and my costumes. I had the time to plan not just one, but two costumes. With my crystal-clear hindsight, I am able to say that both turned out fantastic.
I wasn’t worried about getting murdered in my own home.
That certainly indicates progress — it is objectively good that I get to worry about the quality of my social life before my mortality.
But I was filled with a sense of dread that I can only acknowledge as survivor’s guilt — the gut-wrenching sensation of deeply questioning why those people 150 years ago could not have had the same sense of security I do. It was the accumulation of 150 years of trauma packed into one Sunday evening for a 19-year-old Chinese American girl. The trauma of being implicitly taught that Chinese Americans have no place in American history through years of public school education. The ongoing painful and fragmented unlearning experience, strung together by the many ways people like her were, at best, considered too “white-adjacent” to experience racism and at worst, brutally killed.
History didn’t start out this traumatically for me. Learning about past events and how they shape our world into the way it is today didn’t always make me feel like a witness at forlorn crime scenes. I didn’t always feel like I was stumbling across bodies shallowly buried in the unfilled gaps and blank spaces of archives and textbooks with every newly acquired piece of historical knowledge about marginalized communities and peoples.
I was — and I still am — deeply passionate about History and its potential to uncover new visions of the past that guide our paths into the future.
I tried to guide my own path with a vision of the past as well: W.H. Auden writes of the glorification and disillusionment of war in his poem “The Shield of Achilles,” in which the goddess Thetis approaches Hephaestus, blacksmith of the Greek gods, to make a shield for her son Achilles that would glorify both the Trojan War and Achilles as a warrior. Hephaestus instead presents Thetis with a shield that depicts the destructiveness of war and Achilles’s bleak future.
I entered and navigated Harvard as an academic space likening myself to both Thetis and Hephaestus, with History as my Achilles. With a strong belief in History’s capacity to inform positive changes, I began etching a shield for it. But, the more I etched, the more dead bodies appeared on my shield. I was engulfed by fantasies of kleos aphthiton: the “imperishable glory” brought forth by the framing of historical research as an implicit and subdued celebration of past deaths, rooted in the assumption that we can always make meaning out of them and capitalize on this morbid momentum.
Yet, I still don’t know the meaning of murdering 18 Chinese people.
What I do know is that I will arrive at this unnecessary epiphany and mourn many more times. I know I have at least my remaining years at Harvard as an undergraduate student to do that. Possibly, I have the entirety of my remaining lifespan to understand that surviving violence is an essential part of what it historically and continuously means to be Chinese American.
To embark on a journey to uncover the untold histories of peoples who are deemed unimportant by neglect, I suppose, will always lead to moments like this. The shield of Achilles, no matter how glorious in intention, is after all, an etched portrait of the horrors of war. The pursuit of history, no matter how optimistic we may be of the future because of it, is after all, our etchings of pasts made possible only by deaths and the passage of time. I’ll keep etching, but for now, I want to mourn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has recently come to my attention that I have a bit of a Southern accent.
Allegedly evident in the slightly twangy way I say the word “when” (apparently I say it like “win,” but I am not fully convinced) and my drawn-out pronunciation of “y’all” (okay, this one I understand), it was something I was originally averse to, but have slowly grown to love.
Why do I love it? Many reasons. Maybe because it comes out the most prominently when I am on the phone with my parents. You may have caught me in the act — speaking perhaps a little too loudly on the curb of Widener with the slight trill of a Southern accent, calling my parents every Sunday afternoon. Maybe because it reminds me of old friends and family back home. Regardless, it is a piece of home I may have once rejected, but now embrace with open arms, all because it reminds me to slow down.
In these little moments I am reminded of where I am from, and I tuck these moments away as part of what I now deem my “Southern accent.”
Just last week, I decided to reorganize my room, and part of that endeavour involved untangling all of my necklaces — the dainty, thin chains were all wrapped around themselves, forming impenetrable knots and gnarls that eluded my persistent fingernails. And as I began to get annoyed at the seemingly endless task ahead of me, a family fable danced into my consciousness.
My great grandmother is a legend. The first story I remember hearing about her was that when my dad was a child, they were both picking strawberries in their expansive Kentucky backyard, and as they did, a snake slithered out from the vines. My dad’s hand recoiled, and he shouted to my great grandmother: “Nanny! There’s a snake!”
This intimidating 4’10’’ woman with round, rosy cheeks and fingers nimble from decades of knitting and quilting came over to where my dad was and slowly peered into the vines. Then, as if struck by lightning, grabbed the snake from the mess of foliage, snapped its neck, and threw it to the side. “Alrighty hun, get back to work,” she told my dad — unfazed and unbothered, Southern accent dancing upon her jovial tone.
My great grandmother, in addition to her snake-snapping abilities, gives amazing advice, and my favorite is this: You will never untangle a necklace chain by yanking at it — you must gently and slowly encourage it to unravel. And so, alone in my dorm room at Harvard hundreds of miles away, the words of my Nanny came to me, reminding me to take my time and to slow down.
That piece of advice has remained with me for years, just like my nagging Southern accent that colors certain vowels and words. And just like the elongated, molasses nature of the Southern accent, my great grandmother’s words emphasize the beauty of slowness. You cannot disentangle a gnarled necklace chain quickly — in fact, the faster you try to go, the more knotted it will become.
This is what a Southern accent means to me. Purposeful and intentional slowing down, little mannerisms and memories and ways of speaking that remind me of where I come from.
College is a time of transition, of transformation, and while we should be figuring out who we are and who we want to be, we must also remember who we have been and where we come from. I will always untangle my necklaces with care, with gentle fingers and delicate intention, and I will always elongate the “a” in my favorite word “y’all.”
I choose to slow down, to float on the surface of the water rather than frantically treading it, within this insane, exhausting work culture of Harvard. I choose to get up early in the morning in hopes of seeing some semblance of the grand Texas sky in the muted colors of a Cambridge sunrise, instead of jumping straight into the Harvard hamster wheel. I choose to slow down, and I have my subtle Southern accent to thank for that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another year, another interrupted speech. In what may well become a tradition, student activists interrupted University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s Parents Weekend speech last Friday. As Bacow began addressing the sea of freshmen and their parents at First-Year Family Weekend, dozens of freshmen chanting “fair contract now!” walked out of the auditorium in support of the Harvard Graduate Student Union strike.
We applaud the protest’s aims and its execution. The demonstrators stood up, clearly articulated their cause, and promptly exited the building. They abided by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ free speech guidelines, a thoughtful set of policies that we have firmly defended in the past. President Bacow was in no way denied his right to speak — in fact, he kept it pushing, taking only seconds to acknowledge the disruption, and then to give a complimentary nod to its student organizers. The protest advanced a worthwhile cause, but never aimed to do so at the exclusion or silencing of others. Next year’s student activists should look to last week’s protest as just one example of effective, thoughtful protest.
Student demonstrations on Parents’ Weekend and other attention-attracting dates are popular for good reason: Protests are essential, on and off campus. They can help challenge harmful preexisting norms and invite positive change. Students have been protesting on college campuses for centuries, using loud voices and brightly-colored signs to call for reform. Harvard too has an extremely rich, centuries-old history of student protest, one that can be traced back to just two years after the College’s 17th century founding, when students rose up to protest against then-President Eaton’s use of physical beatings to impart discipline.
We haven’t stopped protesting since — nor should we.
Protests at Harvard have a track record of improving our community and the experiences of the people within it — and we doubt that change would’ve come about without some rebel rousing. A laundry list of crucial Harvard policy shifts can be traced back to rowdy, vocal students: the end of campus enlistment programs during the Vietnam War, the creation of an African and African American Studies department, divestment from fossil fuel companies and Apartheid South Africa, and contract improvements for Harvard University Dining Services workers. Students, in advancing the causes they’re passionate about through vocal public protest, have made Harvard better.
We are glad to see this year’s crop of freshmen pick up the baton — or rather, the banner. As freshmen who have spent comparatively little time on campus, they have proven quick to use their right to protest to advocate for change.
We are especially glad to see the freshmen stand up for an issue that can initially (and deceptively) seem so separate from their own lives. Their willingness to support graduate student workers who they might not know very well is, in that way, thoughtful and kind. While the graduate student union did not organize the demonstration, they sanctioned and supported it. We appreciate the fact that the student protesters sought approval from the union for their walkout, centering the needs and perspectives of graduate student workers before themselves. Despite their short stint at Harvard, the members of our newest class have taken to caring for the broader Harvard community incredibly quickly.
By demonstrating in support of the graduate student union, the freshmen that organized this walkout are throwing their weight behind a cause bigger than themselves. By protesting at all, they are making Harvard a better place for all of us, showing us how to fight for the campus and world we want to live in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay outlined her vision for recruiting new and more diverse faculty in an interview Thursday.
Though departures in the past academic year caused a dip in the number of ladder faculty, Gay said the rosier financial outlook for the FAS has allowed for increased investment in launching “really high quality searches” for faculty. The FAS ended fiscal year 2021 with a $51 million surplus, defying the school’s earlier projections that it would incur a $112 million deficit.
“By high quality, I mean searches that begin through the creation of a really robust and diverse applicant pool,” she said. “Doing that takes work. In many ways, the most important and the most labor intensive part of a search process is at the beginning, when you’re doing the work of building a really robust applicant pool.”
Gay said while recruiting new and diverse scholars is a perennial challenge for Harvard, she believes current work within the FAS to diversify its ranks is “incomparable across time” and “across institutions.” She expressed optimism that “meaningful progress” will continue “on a yearly basis.”
“It's going to take a while to build a faculty as diverse as we would like for it to be and that truly reflects the pool of talent that’s out there in the world,” she said. “While that progress might feel incremental and too slow for those of us who’ve been waiting for this for a long time, it’s progress nonetheless.”
Gay also discussed how the FAS plans to support junior faculty currently on the tenure track at the University. Pointing to a report published this fall by a tenure track review committee, Gay said it is important that senior faculty engage with junior faculty “through the entire arc of their careers here at Harvard and in the FAS.”
“It might manifest in the form of offering comments and feedback on a monograph in progress or on the development of a funding proposal,” Gay said.
Gay reminisced on the “important source of support” she received through mentorship by a “network of colleagues” along her journey through academia.
“It was mentorship that’s not necessarily focused on a particular end, but really about my full intellectual and professional development,” she said. “One of my ways of paying it forward is through a real commitment on my part to mentoring colleagues who are either early career or graduate students.”
Beyond tapping into the budget surplus to launch new faculty searches, Gay also discussed the “targeted investments” she has made in procuring new hybrid work technology for offices and classrooms.
Envisioning the future of the FAS, Gay said hybrid and remote work will continue to remain a part of on-campus operations, even after the University has a turned a page on the pandemic.
“Flexible work is an area where there’s potential for modernization, again in ways that are still compatible with our identity as a residential living and learning community but that also is able to attract and retain terrific staff and faculty, and use our resources — including our physical space — as efficiently as possible,” Gay said.

Mass General Brigham will invest $50 million in a new initiative focused on mental health, chronic disease management, and nutrition security, the hospital network announced last week.
MGB will partner with 20 organizations and universities across the Commonwealth for the initiative, per a press release on Oct. 28. The investment builds on the existing $175 million that the hospital system devotes annually to local health programs.
Elsie M. Taveras — the chief community health equity officer at MGB — said in an interview that part of the investment was dedicated to address the shortage of mental health providers and an overwhelming demand for psychological care exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Many of our patients are experiencing unacceptable delays in getting the treatment that they need, and we’re not alone,” Taveras said. “This is happening across the state, across the country.”
To help expand the behavioral health workforce, MGB has collaborated with eight universities in Massachusetts to establish fellowships and loan repayment programs for students entering the mental health practice. In partnership with the Massachusetts Association of Mental Health, MGB is supporting the development of pediatric urgent care services to address growing psychological needs among adolescents.
“The pandemic, as I mentioned earlier, has exacerbated the number of individuals — children and adults — that are needing pretty critical mental health support,” Taveras said. “Our emergency departments are overwhelmed to have children boarding because they can’t seek psychiatric care.”
MGB’s new investment will also aim to promote diversity within the emerging mental health workforce, according to MGB Vice President of Behavioral Health Joy B. Rosen.
“In addition to there being a shortage in the workforce, there is also the problem of needing to diversify our workforce substantially to be able to address people from all walks of life,” Rosen said in an interview. “We’ve been doing a fair amount of contracts with state schools because they have a more diverse population, quite frankly, than a lot of the private schools.”
MGB also dedicated $15 million from its investment to expand access to behavioral health and substance use disorder services at health centers serving people of color in Boston, according to an emailed statement from the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers.
This funding will support two of its initiatives: a workforce incentive program to attract and retain diverse behavioral health providers at health centers, along with novel substance use disorder programming designed in collaboration with individuals battling substance use.
Michael A. Curry, president and CEO of the League of Community Health Centers, praised MGB’s decision to prioritize allocating resources to under-resourced groups.
“We are extremely grateful to Mass General Brigham for this five-year funding commitment to expand mental health and substance use disorder services in communities of color,” he wrote. “Identifying and meeting this critical need is a great example of what happens when you use an equity lens.”
In addition to mental health, MGB also hopes to address the prevalence of chronic conditions such as heart disease and stroke among minority populations through the establishment of a mobile program providing hypertension screening and management services, Taveras said.
MGB is also working to establish teaching kitchens, enroll eligible patients for federal food security sources, and fund hunger-relief organizations, she added.
MGB is partnering with Community Servings, which provides nutritious meals for chronically and critically ill patients and families. The organization expects to serve “68,000 meals to more than 250 individuals” with critical and chronic illnesses in Blue Hills Avenue Corridor, Lynn, Lawrence, and Salem, according to CEO David B. Waters. The funding will also help bolster the development of their nutrition education program.
Dianne Kuzia Hills — executive director of My Brother’s Table, another partner organization that provides free meals in Lynn — said the pandemic and the fight for racial justice have opened many people’s eyes to health disparities and how they may stem from the allocation of healthcare resources.
“When you look at places like Lynn and Chelsea, that are just a stone’s throw away from the greatest health care in the world, I think people are like, ‘What the heck is going on?’” she said. “That really made a lot of people in healthcare, people in social policy work, people in social services all look around and say, ‘Why is there such a disparity?’”
About Fresh — which uses a team of trucks to sell fresh produce in neighborhoods across Boston — also received funding from MGB. Josh Trautwein, the organization’s co-founder and CEO, said he believes MGB has a continued responsibility to use its resources to improve local health.
“These funds will help us to meet the immediate needs of those struggling to access healthy food, prioritizing those at highest risk of chronic disease in Boston,” he wrote. “This support represents the power that healthcare institutions have to invest in systemic, proven solutions to food insecurity and improve long-term public health and wellbeing for all of our communities.”

College students are now permitted to gather indoors in groups of up to 25 people, an increase from the previous limit of 10 people, according to University health guidelines updated last month.
As Covid-19 cases among undergraduates remain low on campus, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences raised the indoor gathering limit “to expand opportunities for students to socialize,” per a weekly update email from the College on Oct. 28. The change first appeared on the University's Environmental Health and Safety website on Oct. 22.
While students lounged near the Charles River, partied at final club courtyards, and indulged in tacos and margaritas on the Felipe’s Taqueria rooftop back on campus at the beginning of the semester, the approach of a cold and dreary New England winter will shift the College’s social scene indoors.
Some upperclassmen houses emailed residents clarifying House-specific policies on indoor gatherings and procedures for booking party spaces following the new guidance.
Cabot House mandated Tuesday that students register all parties, which are only permitted after 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
“Hosting covert unregistered parties can lead to disciplinary action,” Cabot House administrator Amanda Pepper wrote in an email to residents. “There can only be one party per floor per entryway per night.”
Pforzheimer House is requiring a similar registration process for all dorm gatherings with 15 or more students, according to an Oct. 28 email from Pforzheimer Resident Dean Monique A. Roy and academic coordinator Heather Jacques.
Some students said they think the updated rules will have minimal impact on campus social life.
“Nothing’s going to change,” Nicholas Y. Gu ’24 said. “People have already been having larger gatherings either off campus or in the dorms themselves.”
Namirah M. Quadir ’25 said she does not have a “strong opinion” on the increased cap for gatherings.
“I feel as though it won’t make a significant difference if it’s at 25,” Quadir said. “It all depends on how the policy is actually enforced among students.”
Grace A. Greason ’22 said she believes the College should be prepared for students to flout the 25-person limit.
“Once you open up those spaces, you have to be willing to have parties of potentially unlimited sizes,” Greason said. “It’s just what’s going to happen.”
But other students said they believe the new measures are prudent.
Howard J. Timlin ’22-’23 said he believes the loosened restrictions are reasonable, citing low Covid-19 cases and a high vaccination rate among Harvard affiliates.
“I’ve been to other people’s events that they’ve hosted, taking advantage of the new policy,” Timlin said.
Abdikheyre A. “Abdi” Osman ’24 said the revised rules indicate a gradual return to normalcy on campus.
“It’s just a push towards normal life,” Osman said. “I think it’s beneficial.”

Ahead of a vote on a one-year tentative agreement with the University on Monday, some members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers are calling on their leadership to negotiate a higher raise, while others say accepting the 2.9 percent raise will provide immediate relief.
On Oct. 20, the union — which represents more than 5,000 employees — reached a one-year tentative agreement with the University after five months of negotiations. In addition to the raise, the agreement contains a $500 bonus for workers with at least six months of employment, tax assistance on certain Harvard courses, five extra retroactive Covid-19 paid sick days, and a 2.75 percent increase to member assistance funds.
Beginning Monday, union members will cast online ballots to ratify or reject the contract. HUCTW will announce the ratification vote results on Thursday.
Seven union members told The Crimson they have concerns with the relatively low salary increase in the agreement, with some pointing to Harvard’s record-high endowment returns and budget surplus of $283 million.
Christopher Hansen, a digital fabrication technical analyst at the Graduate School of Design, called the agreement “disappointing.”
“The weakness of the contract and the weakness of the compensation, given the budget surplus and return on the endowment, brings a lot of questions into my trust in leadership,” he said.
The agreement’s 2.9 percent pay increase — which applies to members employed for at least a year — would be the lowest among the union’s past few contracts. HUCTW’s 2018 contract included an initial 3.8 percent increase for members employed for one year or more, with 3.5 percent increases in the second and third years of the contract for the average member. The union’s 2016 and 2013 contracts included 3.4 percent annual increases for the average member.
Kevin F. Harrington, faculty assistant in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, said he believes conceding a lower raise would decrease the union’s leverage during next year’s contract negotiations.
“If we have to spend a little more time to get things right, that’s fine,” he said. “That’s what it should be, because we just don’t want to get stuck in a position where we have less leverage in the coming year.”
“I feel if we do vote and accept something that we know to be lower than it should be now, who’s to say we [won’t] get potentially even less next year?” he added.
HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash wrote in an emailed statement that the union negotiating team has “exhausted” every other possible compensation offer.
“When HUCTW negotiators bring a salary package to the table for a ratification vote, it is not because we don’t think our members deserve more or because we think Harvard can’t afford more, it is because we feel that we have exhausted every argument at the negotiating table and explored every avenue for push-back (and [its] viability at that moment in time) and decided that this is the best possible package we can deliver at this time,” she wrote.
Vidya Sivan, a digital communications specialist for alumni of the Kennedy School, said the news of the returns on Harvard’s endowment came toward the end of this round of contract negotiations. She said she believes it will help with negotiations next year.
“We’re actually in a better position to negotiate because the union can say, ‘We didn’t get a raise with inflation this past year, we worked really hard during the pandemic, et cetera, et cetera, and we deserve this since, look at how well the University did,’” she said.
Ceallaigh Reddy, an HUCTW local representative for Harvard Law School, said the one-year contract is “adequate for now,” saying she would prefer a more substantial raise if it were a three-year contract. She added she will vote to ratify the contract.
“I’m very supportive of it,” she said. “It was probably a difficult time for everyone to negotiate this, and I think it was well done, particularly under the circumstances.”
Paul Sherman, a faculty assistant at the Kennedy School who has been with the union for around 13 years, said the debate around the tentative agreement demonstrates that members are engaged.
“In some ways, this is not as much of a slam dunk as previous contracts, so that’s why I think this discussion is healthy and merited and that’s kind of good to see,” he said.
Sherman said he is unsure how he will vote next week. Though the contract is not ideal, he said, he has “confidence” union negotiators accepted the agreement as part of a long-term strategy.
“This is sort of like a stop-gap contract, and then hopefully we can do better in a year,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Justices on the Commonwealth’s highest court appeared skeptical Wednesday as lawyers for former Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber — who is preparing for trial on federal criminal charges — argued in an appeal hearing that Harvard should be obligated to pay for his legal defense.
Lieber faces federal charges of making false statements to federal investigators examining his funding sources; he has pleaded not guilty and his jury trial is set for December.
Officials allege Lieber misrepresented his affiliation with China’s Thousand Talents Program, a talent recruitment program, and failed to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
In October 2020, Lieber filed suit in Middlesex County Superior Court, alleging the University violated its contract by refusing to indemnify him in the criminal case. This past May, a lower-court judge declined to issue a preliminary injunction that would force Harvard to cover his fees.
In Wednesday’s appeal hearing before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, David R. Suny, one of Lieber’s lawyers, told a six-judge panel that the case was “about helping Professor Lieber achieve the right to academic freedom,” and the high-profile nature of the case meant indemnifying him would advance academic freedom more broadly.
Suny previously noted in a briefing to the court that Lieber testified under oath that paying his legal defense would “‘substantially, if not completely, deplete [his] financial resources.’”
“Further, Professor Lieber averred that advancement is necessary to provide for the financial security of his family as he continues to fight the terminal illness of follicular lymphoma,” the briefing continues.
Justice Serge Georges, Jr., however, criticized Suny’s argument Wednesday, calling it “really arrogant” and “very elitist” that a white-collar defendant would use a claim of depleted financial resources to argue for indemnification.
According to the suit, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp denied Lieber’s request for indemnification in May 2020, invoking exclusions in the indemnification policy. Lapp referred specifically to a clause excluding actions in which “the Qualified Person is adjudicated or determined not to have acted in good faith.”
On Wednesday, Joan A. Lukey, a lawyer representing Harvard and Lapp, reiterated Harvard’s stance that Lieber had willfully misled the University by not reporting his affiliations to Chinese institutions.
“I’m going to start very briefly by pointing out that 16 times between 2012 and 2019, Professor Lieber had the opportunity and the obligation to report his outside employment contracts, compensation, and lab arrangements. These were required,” Lukey said.
Lukey said that by misleading Harvard, Lieber “almost got the University into the same trouble that he was in.”
“Harvard goes through all these reports and sits down with Charles Lieber in November of 2018. He denies that he has any affiliation with [Wuhan University of Technology] of any meaningful kind,” Lukey said. “He says he has no teaching contract, has never had anything to do with the Thousand Talents Program.”
Suny argued that Harvard’s indemnification policy terms are too ambiguous, and that “any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the policy, Harvard.”
Justice David A. Lowy, however, questioned Suny’s argument, noting that the policy explicitly states that Harvard retains the right to deny indemnification if the school determines a faculty member violated terms of the policy.
"What’s ambiguous about that?" Lowy asked.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay declined to comment on Lieber’s case in an interview Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Football is a game of inches, especially in the defensive-minded Ivy League. A whistle and a few feet are all that separate Harvard (5-2, 2-2) from an undefeated record and control of its Ivy League fate. But, a controversial timeout against Princeton and a narrow miss on junior kicker Jonah Lipel’s 53-yard field goal attempt later, the Crimson sits at the fringes of the conference title race, with Saturday’s crucial matchup against Columbia (5-2, 2-2) in New York City looming ahead. Playing for more than just pride, the Lions will host Harvard at Wien Stadium at 1 p.m. Fans can tune in via ESPN+ or hear it over the radio at WRCA (1330 AM, 106.1 FM) or WHRB (95.3 FM).
After getting off to its first 5-0 start since 2015, the Crimson has struggled in recent weeks, with Princeton and Dartmouth slowing down its high-powered running game. Against the two Ivy League powerhouses, Harvard has turned its 65 rushing attempts into just 115 yards (1.8 yards per carry). By contrast, the Crimson rushed for nearly three times as many yards in its first game of the season, pounding Georgetown for 335 yards on Sept. 18. Meanwhile, Columbia enters the game off a 37-30 shootout loss against Yale on Oct. 30. With the loss, the Lions fell two games behind Princeton in the Ivy League chase. The Tigers will travel to face the Big Green on Friday in Hanover, N.H.; while a Princeton victory would sew up at least a share of the conference title, a Dartmouth triumph would allow themselves, Harvard, and Columbia to re-enter contention.
In the Crimson’s loss last Saturday, it relied on two different quarterbacks to fill the void left by sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean’s season-ending injury, with senior quarterback Jake Smith in at signal-caller for the first three quarters and junior quarterback Luke Emge taking over in the final frame. Smith completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts for 82 yards, one touchdown, and one interception, while Emge was six for eight, with 73 yards, including a 43-yard completion to senior wide receiver B.J. Watson.
In the Dartmouth contest, offensive coordinator Mickey Fein called just four passing plays in the first quarter, as the rain came down at Harvard Stadium. However, this will not be an issue on Saturday in New York City, when temperatures are expected to be in the mid-50s with no rain or wind. Whichever quarterback Coach Tim Murphy chooses to send out there, Harvard will need to present a balanced offense against the Lions.
Junior running back Aaron Shampklin remains the star of the Crimson offense, having rushed for 76 yards on 17 carries against the Big Green. He sits at exactly 2,000 yards for his Harvard career, becoming the eighth running back in program history to reach the milestone. Even after relatively slow games against Princeton and Dartmouth, he still ranks 14th nationally with 97.3 rushing yards per game. Sophomore running back Aidan Borguet has carried the ball 83 times this season, 19 fewer than Shampklin, and has complemented the 2018 All-Ivy First Teamer with 432 yards and five touchdowns.
Although first-year wide receiver Kaedyn Odermann has missed the last three games with an injury, whichever quarterback starts on Saturday will have plenty of weapons to target. Junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly leads the team in receiving yards with 246, and has used his breakaway speed to find the end zone twice this season. He is complemented by even more speed: two converted running backs in Watson and junior wide receiver Demarkes Stradford, who returned a kickoff 89 yards to begin the second half against Dartmouth, the first touchdown return since junior wide receiver Adam Scott took one to the house in 2017. Additionally, 6’7” senior wide receiver/long snapper Adam West and 6’4” first-year tight end Tyler Neville give the quarterbacks two big targets.
Harvard’s offense will have to face a strong Columbia unit, led by linebacker Scott Valentas, who has racked up 32 tackles this season and led the team with 12 against Yale. In addition, linebacker Cam Dillon is on a redemption tour this season, pacing the Lions with 37 total tackles after suffering an injury that kept him out of the final seven games of the 2019 season. Defensive back Ben Mathiasmeier has intercepted three passes, tops on the Columbia defense.
The Lions have done a good job keeping their opponents from moving the chains. In seven games, they have allowed just 123 first downs, which ties for the 11th-fewest in the nation. Additionally, Columbia boasts the country's 15th-strongest rushing defense, allowing 108 yards per game. Strong rushing defenses are a staple in the Ivy League: of the 20 stingiest teams in the country, five are in the Ancient Eight: Harvard (first), Princeton (second), Columbia (15th), Yale (16th) and Dartmouth (18th).
In total, the Crimson has allowed just 56.4 rushing yards per game, after holding Lafayette to negative-24 net rushing yards on Oct. 16. The key to Harvard’s first-placed ranking is its dominant front seven, led by sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec and first-year defensive tackle Thor Griffith, who was named on Oct. 27 to the Stats Perform FCS Jerry Rice Award Watch List, which honors the best first-year player in the country. Griffith, who has racked up 16 tackles, including three sacks and a forced fumble, is the only Ivy League player on the watch list. The Portsmouth, N.H. native has been a powerful force on a Crimson defense that ranks second nationally with 31 sacks.
Junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes leads the team with six sacks, but Leskovec has contributed 5.5 of his own. Harvard also has intercepted 11 passes, good enough to place it in a tie for ninth nationally. Despite allowing 228.9 yards per game through the air, which ranks 70th and second to last in the Ancient Eight, it ranks eighth in team passing efficiency defense (102.2), an advanced statistic that takes turnovers into account. Junior safety James Herring plays a major role in keeping the defense steady, leading the team with 54 total tackles.
The Crimson excels when its back is up against the wall. It has allowed just 113 first downs this season, good for sixth in the Football Championship Series (FCS), but only 31 of those have come on third or fourth down. Harvard’s opponents earn a fresh set of downs on third down just 24.5% of the time, the third-lowest rate in the country. The Crimson is even better on fourth down, when teams only choose to go for it when the odds appear to be in their favor. Despite facing a lot of short yardages, Harvard’s defense has conceded a first down on just 22.2 percent of its fourth down opportunities.
On Saturday, defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ‘99’s unit will hope to slow down a Columbia offense that ranks as the 28th best rushing offense in the country, averaging 175.9 yards per game. Running back Dante Miller, despite a relatively sluggish performance against Yale on Oct. 30, has caused fits for opposing defenses all season, turning his 105 handoffs into 643 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Ryan Young led the team with 92 yards and three touchdowns against Yale, his first three of the season, to go along with 379 yards.
The Lions do not turn to the air much, ranking just 98th in the FCS with 163.1 passing yards per game. However, when they do, quarterback Joe Green has been effective. This season, he has completed 58.9 percent of his passes for 1,118 yards and four touchdowns while throwing just one interception. In Columbia’s signature win this season, a 19-0 victory over Dartmouth on Oct. 22, Green managed a 14/22, 98-yard, one-touchdown performance to help his team outduel the Big Green. When he does pass, his preferred target is wide receiver Marcus Libman, who leads the team with 202 yards.
Harvard has a commanding lead in the all-time series, 62-15-1. However, the Lions won the last matchup, a 17-10 overtime affair in New York City in 2019. After the loss, the Crimson lost its remaining two games and staggered to a 4-6 final record, its only losing season since the turn of the millennium. Both universities have brought different teams this time around, and the visitors cannot afford the same result. If Harvard wants any realistic hope of raising its tenth banner in Murphy’s 27-year reign, it absolutely must win on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University men’s hockey team will face its first major tests of the 2021-22 season this weekend against a pair of conference rivals.
Riding high after a pair of blowout wins to open the season last weekend, No. 9/13 Harvard (2-0, 1-0 ECAC) will put its unblemished record on the line against No. 14/15 Cornell and Colgate this weekend at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Harvard dominated in its first two games of the year against Dartmouth and Bentley, scoring 16 goals in its first 120 minutes of the season. But the Crimson will face a much tougher task on Friday when it will welcome the Big Red (2-0, 0-0 ECAC) to town at 7 p.m. for the first rivalry match between the two squads in nearly two years.
“It’s a good challenge for us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s nice — and it’s fun — to be able to have the puck go in the net like it has the last couple of nights. But you also have to be able to win a close game, a tight checking game, a game that should have a lot of emotion in it. So I think it's a good test for us.”
Harvard and Cornell, whose storied hockey rivalry dates back to the early 1900s, last met in January 2020 at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y., where they fought to a 1-1 tie. Harvard has not beaten Cornell at home since 2016. The last time the two teams met at Bright-Landry in December 2019, the Big Red claimed a 3-1 victory, jumping out to a 2-0 lead in front of a Cornell-friendly packed house and never looking back.
This season, the Crimson was powered in its first two games by a standout performance from junior defenseman Henry Thrun, who was named the ECAC Hockey Player of the Week after notching eight points in the first pair of contests with a goal and seven assists. Thrun tallied five assists in Harvard’s 7-3 win over Bentley, becoming the first Crimson player to do so since 2002.
Cornell also opened its season with a pair of overtime wins last weekend, meaning that one perfect record will be shattered Friday. The Big Red opened its 2021-22 campaign with a two-game sweep of Alaska.
“Can't wait to get started,” said Harvard junior forward Nick Abruzzese of the Cornell matchup. “That’s the type of game that you miss [in] a year-and-a-half you don't have.”
The Big Read appears less fearsome than it did two years ago, when it was the top-ranked team in the country. Cornell features a cluster of new faces at the blue line and in net, including three goalies who had never played in a college hockey game before this season. But the squad has also returned a group of key forwards. Upperclassmen have scored three of the Big Red’s four goals so far, including both game-winners last weekend.
“I think it’s going to be a different game,” Donato said of the Cornell contest. “You know they’re going to challenge your compete level, they’re going to challenge your willingness to get to the net. They’re usually very strong defensively and physical.”
Harvard will welcome Colgate (5-4, 0-0 ECAC) at 7 p.m. Saturday before turning right around to face Northeastern (5-3, 2-2 Hockey East) on the other side of the river Monday night in a cross-town non-conference showdown. Colgate lost both of its games last weekend, but each by only one goal to No. 10/11 Western Michigan, falling 6-5 before turning around for a 2-1 overtime loss to the Broncos. Meanwhile, the Huskies are coming off of a pair of conference wins against Maine last weekend, 5-0 and 3-2. Before facing the Crimson on Monday, like Harvard, Northeastern will also have its hands full this weekend with a pair of conference games, squaring off with New Hampshire twice.
“We’re a young team, we’re going to have to be able to win against different styles if we want to have some success,” Donato said. “This whole weekend is a challenge — certainly starting with Cornell, but playing three [games] in four nights should be a good test for us.”

After the last few months with classes back in-person and ~relatively~ normal, there are many things to feel hopeful about when looking toward the future. Whether that be anything from having a normal sleep schedule to making it onto Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s instagram — join Flyby in manifesting smooth sailing from here on out. Here are a few things that topped our list:
Cuffing season actually living up to its name
Ah yes, cuffing season. Happening annually during the pitch black, brutally freezing winter months between October and Valentine’s Day, this is the season to find that special someone to cuddle up with sheerly for the purpose of stealing their body heat. Come Valentine’s day, you can celebrate the culmination of a beautiful relationship built of 50% shared body heat and 50% seasonal depression-induced mental breakdowns. Now to actually find someone who mutually agrees to participate in such a deeply intimate relationship…Manifest, manifest.
Becoming that person
A tough one indeed…but manifesting that we truly can become the idyllic TikTok “day in the life” person who wakes up at 6 a.m., makes their perfect bed in their perfectly decorated 20th floor NYC apartment with a perfect view and makes a perfect avocado toast with a perfectly poached egg and…no we’re not jealous (or at least not about the 6 a.m. wake up time). Anyway, you get the point — fix that dicey sleep schedule, squeeze in a morning run, even buy yourself some avocados from Trader Joe’s, and craft a janky dorm avocado toast with hard boiled HUDS eggs. You gotta do what you gotta do.
The beautification of HUDS
Speaking of HUDS, let us manifest its *spicing up.* We love you HUDS, but sometimes a student needs their full cereal selection and a working hot chocolate machine. Not to mention an endless supply of brain break bagels. Or a hot breakfast that isn’t just ~water with a pinch of oats~. And since we’re on the topic — when are the house grilles coming back? Perhaps with some additional manifesting there may even be a fully functional ice cream machine...
Cuffed…but summer job edition
While some people actually have their lives together and have had a $100k summer job lined up as of January three years ago, the rest of us have yet to live out our dreams of corporate retreats in the Hamptons and purchasing $8 coffees on our way to work every morning. Fear not! With this manifestation, you’ll be the one making “a day in my life as an investment banker in NYC” TikToks in no time. Or, if that’s not your thing, you can live out the summer of your dreams — on a beach in Mexico, vibing in a castle somewhere in the French countryside, hibernating in your bed after (barely) surviving in-person final exams…you do you, boo.
Hibernation
On the topic of hibernation, there better be some r e j u v e n a t i n g breaks in our near future. Thanksgiving is time for family and friends, not for psets and papers. Being in person again and balancing academics against a dwindling social battery, coupled with extreme FOMO following every missed event, really takes it out of you. Whether you’re traveling home to see family or spending Thanksgiving cuddling with the turkeys that refuse to let you leave your dorm (ah, the sardonicism) let’s manifest some relaxing and very well-deserved time off.
Good vibes at Harvard-Yale 
Even though it definitely won’t be the same as in past years, let’s manifest a festive Harvard-Yale that isn’t cancelled last-minute (Yardfest, we’re looking at you). Whatever a good time means for you, let’s keep the fantastic vibes going so that we all get to experience the joys of watching men tackle each other for a couple hours on a ~foreign~ campus. Let the rest be history.
Survivable Weather
While we’ve been blessed with relatively tame (and arguably beautiful) weather over the past few months, things are slowly starting to creep downhill. It’s always during that first bone-chillingly cold day of the fall when you’re hit with the realization that winter is very much a real thing, and this year it’s even worse because we actually have to *commute* to classes. Here’s to hoping that the snow isn’t too rough this year (or if it is...we’ll have a snow day), that the dorm heating system actually works, and that no one is attacked by swarms of Canada geese migrating South for the winter.
Becoming Famous
Finally, what may be the ultimate manifestation of them all…making it onto Dean Khurana’s Instagram. A select few have already made it to the top, and oh how badly we want to be them. To think we actually attend the same school as these people! Perhaps we’ll make it before our time here is up <3
So there you have it, our specially curated Flyby manifestations to help us all make it through these next few weeks, or months, or even years here at our beloved H. It may be impossible to have it all, but honestly just one of these could be enough to satisfy (preferably Dean Khurana). Happy fall, and stay safe out there with the geese y’all.

Yardfest been letting you down a bit the past few years? Me too, even though I’ve never experienced one. However, I do know exactly what type of Yardfest I want to experience. Stay tuned for the Yardfest of all of our dreams that I better see that $50 billion put toward.
The Opening Acts
Enter opener Olivia Rodrigo. (Damn, she’s just the opener? Yes. This is just the beginning.) Olivia gets the crazy vibes flowing. Everyone’s hype af. But the fun is just beginning.
BOOM. There’s Harry Styles. He performs all of his “Fine Line” album (+ Kiwi, Sign of the Times, etc.) He’s finishing off with “Falling” and — just as we’re all breaking down sobbing – Liam, Niall, Zayn, and Louis come out on stage. THIS is the 1D reunion. RIGHT HERE IN HARVARD YARD. Our tears cease and screaming commences as we witness One Direction perform their biggest hits live.
Our Juicy Headliners
Next up, we have a highly, HIGHLY anticipated act. It’s a rap battle between Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana and University President Larry Bacow! It’s almost a tie, until at the very last possible moment Rakesh whips out a KILLER verse. We are all in awe! Are those tears in Larry’s eyes?
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, Taylor Swift rolls out. The crowd goes wild! She performs literally her entire discography, ending with the 10 minute version of “All Too Well.” Life feels too good to be true! Have you died and gone to heaven?
The ~men~ in the crowd are feeling a little cheated after listening to all of Taylor’s discography. Just as they’re about to leave, Kanye comes out! Hooray? He performs some songs I guess. Kim is on drums. Life is good!
Kanye’s followed by, you guessed it! Actually you probably didn’t. It’s a second Fifth Harmony! Members are Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, Lizzo, Doja Cat, and Megan Thee Stallion. Wow, just wow. They perform some NEVER HEARD BEFORE songs. It KNOCKS. OUR. SOCKS. OFF.
The Ultimate Finale
We’re reaching the end, unfortunately. But we’ve saved the best for last! Enter the most hype finale of all time. The greatest concert of your life concludes with the greatest artist of all time.
There he is!
It’s… No, it can’t be!
Is that who I think it is?
It is! It’s him!
The one and only…
B. o. B.
TEARS OF JOY FLOOD THE CROWD’S FACES. THIS IS THE BEST NIGHT OF ALL OF OUR LIVES. THERE ARE AIRPLANES IN THE NIGHT SKY. LIKE SHOOTING STARS. OR ARE THOSE OUR TEARS? We’ll never know. All we know is that B.o.B just gave us the grandest finale to the grandest Yardfest we will ever experience. College Events Board — you have your assignment.

As a senior in the class of 2022, let me just say: I am afraid. Afraid of what, you may ask? Many, many things – finals, getting a job, where am I going to live, the list goes on – but above all, I am afraid of what on earth is happening with commencement. While our main man Bacow has assured us that they’re planning to hold an in-person commencement in the spring, somehow this fills me with little confidence.
As we’ve come back to campus in person and braved the joys and pains of in-person classes again, truly the only thing keeping us going is that proverbial light at the end of the thesis-grind tunnel. That light is a real, not Zoom commencement full of hugs, tears, and Instagrammable grad pics. And for our dear friends from the Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 who disappeared into the void, I miss you! Consider this my desperate plea for you too.
Why Am I So Desperate, You Ask?
Because I (will have) graduated from Harvard, dammit! It was difficult! It was memorable! I want to walk around in a swishy robe and get some external validation and cry with my friends. Maybe I’ve spent too much time on WitchTok lately, but I’m *this* close to burning some candles in my room and setting the fire alarms off in the name of manifestation if that’s what it takes. It is “ONE OF THE MOST ENDEARING SIGNS OF THE EVERLASTING HARVARD.” Please. Don’t make me beg.
The Celebration of the Century
So imagine we’ve manifested, and woohoo! Commencement is happening in person! Now the question remains: how do we make this the celebration to end all celebrations? Picture it with me: our Class Day speaker is announced, and they’re so cool your jaw physically drops. Cambridge blesses us with beautiful weather all Senior Week long. You get your Match 22 results back, and Everyone. Matched. You. Back. You reunite with that one girl you literally haven’t seen since freshman spring, and become best friends over a Felipe’s marg. You finally get that diploma, and your closest friends and family are there to see it happen.
Essentially: it’s that grand finale we’ve truly all been waiting for. And sure, maybe things won’t shape out exactly like that, but we can dream.
And An Accessible One Too ;)
And while we’re imagining that dream scenario… Let’s make sure everyone can actually join in? The Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 are halfway across the world by now, (mostly) living Real Adult Lives (unless they’re still in a Netflix-filled post-grad haze, in which case, yeah, we feel that). As a now washed-up senior myself, I can’t help but miss all the upperclassmen whom I said goodbye to far too soon. There’s a little 2020 and 2021-shaped hole in my heart, and it can only be filled by a triple commencement party that quite literally opens a sinkhole in Tercentenary Theatre.
Good thing we can totally depend on Daddy Harvard’s record-breaking endowment to sponsor such a party, right? I mean, what else is an endowment for if not for funding the celebration to end all celebrations – and making sure people outside Razor Scooter-distance from campus can actually attend???
(Several Econ majors have told me in various levels of condescension that, no, that is not what the endowment is for, but I stopped listening. I’m on a manifestation grind. I attract what belongs to me, I cannot hear the haters, my Sketchers light up in the dark and they will light my path.)
So. Let’s manifest. Classes of 2020, 2021, and 2022 – I’m calling upon the good vibes of every Bones Day from Noodle, every late-night appearance from Remy the Cat, and every good wifi day from HUIT for the commencements each class has been waiting for and deserves. Make them special, make them accessible, and make them the celebration we’ve been anticipating for (quite literally) years at this point. We know things may look different from the commencements of pre-pandemic – but Larry, please don’t let postponed become cancelled<3
