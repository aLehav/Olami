After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hip-hop Holy Trinity of Kanye West, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar succeeded in the unlikely task of following up stellar mixtapes with even more exciting major label debuts. Their oft-referenced leaps from underground hype to radio and critical dominance have so invaded the zeitgeist (thanks in part to the rappers’ own mythologizing) that one can easily forget that many immensely talented rappers follow the opposite path. This is unfortunately the case with Travis Scott’s “Rodeo,” the album that has blossomed out of his exceptional tapes “Owl Pharaoh” and “Days Before Rodeo.”
Whereas in his earlier offerings Scott seemed content to offer an opaque, often-nihilistic lyrical landscape, “Rodeo” often drowns in the dissonance between Scott’s ostensibly lofty biographical elements and his continued ambiguity. As usual, Scott falls hard, smokes heavy, pops pills, and is brutally aware of the destructive elements of his existence. On “Pornography,” a surprisingly detailed intro, Scott identifies as “a young rebel against the system / unable to conform or comply to the ways of authority.” Instead of a coherent list of grievances, however, or even a detailed list of the ways in which Scott paves a dissident path (just the drugs?), the next hour consists primarily of the same vague retellings of blurry nights. And the endless cavalcade of star features—Kanye, Young Thug, Future, 2 Chainz, a believable Young Thug-imitating Justin Bieber, and the Weeknd—primarily serve to mask Scott’s inability or unwillingness to tell stories about himself.
It’s not uncommon for rappers to get caught up in the gravitas of an intro and to suggest a higher degree of political engagement or self-awareness than the overall album eventually delivers. This isn’t a new disparity for Scott; he raps and sings uniquely about his intoxicated and intoxicating lifestyle, and that has been enough to catapult him to stardom. Much of the album’s hype is tied up in “Antidote” and “3500,” two exhilarating singles (the former wasn’t initially on the album but received so much positive feedback that it was included) that are by no means anthems of particular lyrical depth. The singles succeed because they expertly advertise what Scott is best at, which turns out to be an almost hilariously cliché and even archaic attribute: matching a mantra to a catchy hook and repeating it over and over.
Where “Rodeo” struggles, then, has just as much to do with somewhat stale production as it does with Scott’s empty proclamations of depth. “Nightcrawler,” featuring Chief Keef and Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee—two of the only figures in rap who have carved out as intriguingly weird niches between raw aggression and melodic intricacy—ends up over-synthesized and sounding more like the Weeknd crooning about glitzy drinking than the wacky quasi-tonality one would expect of such a heady meeting of the minds. Scott’s song with the actual Weeknd, “Pray 4 Love,” also suffers from clumsy production, over-employing Scott’s autotune and causing his voice to clash with the Weeknd’s crystal-clear tenor. Both “90210” and “Apple Pie,” the disappointing and shallow finale, sound like outtakes from “808s & Heartbreak”—the first half of “90210” is almost plagiaristic in its similarity to Kanye’s “RoboCop.” Scott, who produced several of the songs on the album along with his close-knit, mostly in-house team, doesn’t seem like he’s focused enough on instrumentally complementing his obvious lyrical potential.
Despite the inherent limitations of Scott’s subject matter and production, there are moments of true inspiration on “Rodeo.” For one, West appears to bring out Scott’s political side—“Piss On Your Grave” is a truly weird and wonderful track. West and Scott, who also co-produced the song, employ Jimi Hendrix’s “Machine Gun” as a hypnotic backing to a polemic on police and haters at large. “Us niggas, we can’t behave / We mobbed on the pave / Got treated like slaves / Young niggas treated like slaves,” screams Scott over the noise. While other tracks on “Rodeo” are certainly threatening, the anger never feels as especially directed as it does here. A late song, “Flying High,” comes close, with a repeated refrain of “We don’t fuck with cops.” When Scott has a target for his aggression, he’s simply better.
Travis Scott and his production team have a sound that can be unlike anything even the most seasoned rap listeners have heard before; there are several uses of guitar outside of “Piss on Your Grave” that are mind-blowing; the singles are some of the best songs of the year; and scattered verses on “Impossible” and “Wasted” are incredibly focused. If Scott can better present his story and remember to keep valuing the weird in his production, he has no limit to what he can do. If not, he’s little more than confused pastiche.

Frats throw parties and sororities don’t. It’s a simple fact of life that college students tend to take for granted without even realizing it. “That’s just the way things are” is a stubborn defense, and we often accept things because we’re used to them, not because they’re right.
But give it more than two seconds of thought and it’s hard to think of a non-sexist justification for this state of affairs. In fact, not only do sororities tend not to throw parties, they are actually not allowed to: While fraternities are fairly free to do what they want, every sorority’s national organization prohibits all alcohol in sorority houses at all times. It’s a rarely discussed double standard that has huge implications for campus life nationwide.
National sorority organizations should overturn their unconditional bans on alcohol in order to make campus social scenes safer and more egalitarian. When only men can throw parties, men control the most popular—and the most dangerous—social spaces. It’s arguably the most fundamental underpinning of campus rape culture. Even well-intentioned (which is an assumption that can’t be universally granted) men still get to feel safer on their own turf, don’t have to meet someone else’s standards to score invites to parties, and get to have control over what their social spaces look like, while women do not. And while rape is not just a male-on-female crime, it’s very likely that having some parties controlled by women would reduce the risk of sexual assault.
Further, even independent of its consequences, the very existence of this double standard demeans collegiate women. We tell men that they are adults able to make their own decisions, while we tell women that they must be held to a separate standard of respectable, ladylike behavior. My sorority is not even allowed to host a wine and cheese event in our space. Meanwhile, my friends in fraternities can throw huge parties whenever they please.
There’s absolutely no reasonable justification for this unequal treatment, and it feels just as antiquated and unfair as it should. It’s like being told your brother is allowed to go out at night without a chaperone because boys will be boys, but you’re not because you’re a well-behaved young lady.
There’s a small movement to fight this double standard, and I think it’s a great one. The Sigma Delta sorority at Dartmouth, for example, is able to host parties with alcohol because it does not have a national affiliation, allowing women to feel safer at parties with female bartenders and women manning the doors. Yet the change lacks widespread support, particularly within Greek organizations. National sorority organizations tend to ban alcohol to get lower insurance rates, or because they argue that women don’t want to live in a place with rowdy parties.
I get these arguments to an extent. But ultimately, particularly in the context of sadly already-expensive dues, something that has the potential to keep women safer is worth the added cost. If women don’t want to throw rowdy parties, they certainly don’t have to, but they should at least be allowed to make the choice for themselves.
The only objection I find mildly convincing is the argument that introducing more alcohol is not the way to make Greek life safer, and that if double standards are the problem, we should instead ban alcohol in frats. But that’s a far more unrealistic and overreaching solution: Some might see it as an unfortunate reality, but it is nonetheless true that many college students will drink no matter what.
I’m all for taking certain steps to combat problems with alcohol in Greek life, such as having sober members present to monitor parties or banning punch. But an all-out ban on alcohol, even for closed events, raises the same problems as an insistence on abstinence-only sex education. We know students are going to drink, so let’s instead try to make that drinking as safe as possible.
While I’m a member of a sorority at Harvard and have had an incredibly positive experience, I understand that Greek life more generally receives a lot of valid criticism. But so long as Greek life exists in its current form, it might as well exist without blatant double standards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard University administrators rolled out further changes to the health insurance plans for non-union employees that were first revised last year. Rising healthcare costs motivated the initial decision, which allocated a greater part of the financial burden towards deductibles and coinsurance. At the time, professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences expressed their disagreement vehemently, passing a unanimous motion condemning the policy change for its unfairness to non-unionized Harvard staff. The University has now reversed course and reintroduced a healthcare plan that does not include deductibles.
There is little doubt that the administration’s decision to change their position in response to strong faculty opposition was the right choice; nevertheless, this is one troubling episode in a larger trend of University decisions that have been made without first informing or consulting the affected parties.
The administration’s responsiveness to faculty opposition should be lauded. Professors are the lifeblood of the College. Influential ones stay for decades and can play a strong role in shaping this institution and what students learn here. The opinion of the faculty matters, and when its members feel strongly enough to pass a unanimous resolution, the administration must take note.
That's why we are glad to see the University respond in a substantive way to last spring's criticism. But perhaps more important, we are troubled by the overarching trend we have seen from the administration in its decision-making process. Within the last year, Harvard has made several important policy decisions without seeking input from students or faculty. These decisions have all led to lengthy disputes, messy implementation, and ultimately backtracking by the administration as Harvard affiliates pushed back on policies that were created without regard for the opinions of those affected by the changes.
The University’s decision to close Stillman Infirmary reported by The Crimson last November—made without consulting House masters or resident deans—sparked protests from students. An eventual compromise was reached, combining the original plan to reallocate University Health Services resources with the development of protocols for continuing after-hour care. The Stillman controversy came in the heat of another debacle, this one—like the health plan debate—concerning a Harvard faculty: Law School professors had objected strongly to the University’s new sexual assault policy, announced in the summer of 2014. Though a large part of the criticism focused on problems with the policy itself, the professors also balked at the lack of faculty consultation in creating the policy. Eventually, the Law School developed its own policy, separate from the procedures used by the rest of the University.
These messy situations are mostly preventable. In each case, requesting input from Harvard students and faculty before implementing policy changes would have smoothed the process and reduced strife. Going forward, we hope that the administration will place greater importance on the opinions of the relevant parties in important policy decisions: The avoidance of protracted fights is beneficial to all and would be conducive to crafting better decisions. The administration must learn to listen more—to its students and to its faculties—before making decisions.

Computer Science 50 is an introductory college course. It meets on Mondays and Wednesdays in Sanders Theater from 1 to 2 p.m. It has a 90-minute weekly section. The assignments are nine problem sets, two quizzes, and a final project.
CS50 is versatile: both a gateway into the discipline of Computer Science, and the baseline for a skill set that is becoming ever more valuable. CS50 provides practical skills applicable in the professional as well as the larger academic world. By this account, the class fits comfortably into the scope of the liberal arts, successfully combating the myth that such an education does not or cannot offer practical skills. It requires no prior knowledge, and is generalizable to many ventures because it teaches how to represent information in a new form, just like chemistry, music, or sociology.
Outside of the classroom, however, CS50 is anything but the liberal arts course its creators proclaim. Its unprecedented corporate sponsorship ensures that the course has an unmatched visibility on campus.
No other course gives away and sells merchandise en masse to its students and fan base. T-shirts, umbrellas, aprons, stress balls, M&Ms, and other CS50 paraphernalia are ubiquitous on Harvard’s campus.
No other course makes the first five weeks—that is, the add-drop period—significantly easier than the proceeding eight weeks of the semester, luring less confident students until it’s too late to turn back.
In no other course on Harvard’s campus are students allowed to simultaneously register for conflicting courses, even if they too are filmed.
No other course has disciplinary procedures that bypass the Ad Board.
No other course has seen reports that TFs are instructed to decline to give comment on the course to The Crimson before conferring first with the professor.
A liberal arts education necessarily enables students to make their own choices about their studies, free of social and pre-professional pressure. At a liberal arts university, corporations should not be able to buy students’ attention and interests.
The exceptional status of CS50 creates a dynamic between members of the CS50 in-group and those who do not take the course. Though we acknowledge the value of CS50, its lavish promises of social, academic, and professional success go far beyond reality, often implying that such well-being is accessible only through its doors. In this way, CS50 resembles a proselytizing faith-based religion more than the liberal arts college course it claims to be.
The creators and proponents of CS50 may contend that their practices are different from other courses’ only in scale, or that they have earned the right to their celebrity status because of the course’s popularity. The apparatus of CS50, however, poses a real threat to fundamental principles of freedom of choice and access to a liberal arts education.
By channeling corporate influence onto campus, making unfounded exclusive promises, and bending the university’s rules, CS50 violates its liberal agenda. To preserve its students’ autonomy and protect them from undue peer pressure, we ask the administration to reconsider its indifference and detachment to the growth of CS50—a course equal in its credits but unequal in its capital compared to Harvard’s other offerings. Rein in the unfettered campaign materials, resultant coercive social dynamics, and CS50’s privileged status on campus.
When students turn in their study cards this Thursday, we hope that those who chose CS50 do so purely out of their own interest, not the surrounding pressure and corporate glamour. Visit IdidnottakeCS50.tumblr.com and facebook.com/notCS50 to hear more varying perspectives and contribute to this conversation yourself.

More than 20 local vendors set up stalls under the Science Center Plaza tent on Tuesday for the weekly Harvard Farmers’ Market, held from mid-June until November. From fresh produce to mini cheesecakes, the variety of merchandise attracted numerous Harvard affiliates, Cambridge residents, and tourists despite the balmy weather that at times reached 90 degrees.
Since the Harvard Farmers’ Market’s opened in 2005 as a project of Harvard University Dining Services and the HUDS Food Literacy Project, various merchants have returned to their booths over the years.
“We’re both certified organic and IPM [Integrated Pest Management] conventional, and we’re famous mostly for our fruit,” said Jeff Newton, the vendor representing Lanni Orchards, a family-owned business established in 1963. According to Newton, Lanni Orchards has been selling at the Farmers’ Market at Harvard for 10 years.
In a different aisle of the market, students could be seen sampling chocolate from the stall set up by Taza Chocolate, a Somerville-based company that has partaken in the Harvard Farmers’ Market in previous years.
“We started off in a little kitchen, and now we have a factory just a mile away from this farmers’ market,” said Ayala Een-Chaim, a Taza Chocolate representative. According to Een-Chaim, the company buys cocoa beans directly from farmers across Central and South America and processes them in their factory in Somerville.
Some vendors, like hot sauce company Alex’s Ugly Sauce, debuted at the market for the first time this year. According to Mary Greenfield, the vendor, Alex’s Ugly Sauce sells five different types of hot sauce that uses the same basic ingredients of vinegar, beets, onions, garlic, and honey. This four-person company produces all of its sauces by hand in Dorchester.
The market not only featured edible goods but also other products, such as the flowers sold by Stow Greenhouses. Alexander N. Lee ’17 has been working for the company at different farmers’ market locations throughout the summer.
“It’s entirely farmers’ market-operated, so there’s no storefront,” Lee said. “They just have a fleet of vans that sends out flowers every morning to a bunch of farmer’s markets.”
He added that the Harvard Farmers’ Market differs from other locations due to the seasonal fluctuations in sales. The influx of students at the beginning of the semester accounts for a peak in sales at the Harvard location, Lee said.

Avik Chatterjee ’02, a former Dunster resident tutor who was widely regarded as an ally to BGLTQ students in the House but was not asked back to the position last spring, has been hired to serve as a resident tutor in Currier House beginning this fall.
Chatterjee won an award for his work as a BGLTS and race relations tutor in Dunster last May, and more than 160 Dunster House students signed a petition calling for his reinstatement in the late spring after they raised concerns about the House’s BGLTQ advising resources. 
While Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter said at the time that the House normally does not reappoint tutors who are graduating, the decision prompted pushback from students who worried that they were losing a close ally. The students presented their petition to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde.
Lassonde said at the time that he met with students from Dunster House and that they had a “very thoughtful discussion about House life and their aspirations for the Dunster community," but declined to comment further.
In Currier, Chatterjee will serve on the Quad House's pre-med committee, according to an email newsletter from House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper. He will also serve as a race relations tutor and will help coordinate the House’s intramural sports teams, according to various emails sent to House residents.
Chatterjee declined to comment for this article, in accordance with the preferences of Currier House Masters Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross.
Chatterjee graduated from his School of Public Health Program last spring and is now a research fellow in population medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Chatterjee’s brother, Ayan Chatterjee, served as a tutor in Currier before leaving after last year.

Leading experts on negotiation and nuclear proliferation at the Kennedy School of Government discussed the benefits and risks of the nuclear deal reached between Iran and the P5+1 at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
The international agreement—also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action—would significantly restrict Iran’s nuclear capability for the next 10 to 15 years, limiting plutonium production and uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The agreement has faced significant controversy and criticism in the United States, and both houses of Congress will vote on a resolution of approval or disapproval regarding the deal by Sept. 17.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by New York Times reporter David E. Sanger ’82, came just hours after news that the Obama administration had secured the 42 Democratic pledges that needed in the Senate to block a resolution of disapproval. No Republicans—in either the House or the Senate—have announced that they will support the deal.
The three participants in the discussion—Kennedy School professor and lead Iran negotiator for the George W. Bush administration R. Nicholas Burns; former Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration William H. Tobey; and Kennedy School professor and former Office of Science and Technology Policy adviser Matthew Bunn—all agreed that the framework of the deal included significant risks but differed in how they weighed the concessions made by the United States and its partners in the deal against the at least temporary deceleration of Iran’s nuclear program.
“In 10 to 15 years, many of the central restrictions on numbers of centrifuges and amounts of material will peel off,” Tobey, a critic of the deal, said. “Secretary Kerry I think appropriately said that it’s not really acceptable for Iran to be two months away from a nuclear weapon today, so my question is why is it acceptable in 10 to 15 years?”
Tobey also characterized the deal as possibly already “eroding,” with many top Iranian officials denying that the International Atomic Energy Agency will have access to military sites, what he said would create a “huge gap” in the inspection and verification process.
Burns, who has been a vocal proponent of the deal, said a significant risk would be a covert revamping of the Iran nuclear weapons program under the guise of a civil nuclear program by the fifteenth year of the deal, when most of the restrictions have expired. He repeatedly emphasized, however, that he viewed the deal as the best way to contain Iran’s nuclear capability through diplomacy as opposed to war, and hoped the Obama administration would place the deal at the center of a larger, “tough-minded containment” policy.
Sanger and Bunn noted that no major arms deal in recent American history has passed without significant bipartisan support, a startling contrast to this deal, which Sanger predicted would receive no Republican votes in both the House and Senate. Tobey, for his part, said it would be “bad for the deal and bad for the country if the deal is essentially the product of a vote of disapproval in both houses of Congress.”
“The Iran agreement and the vote that will have to take place in Congress in the next week and a half is probably one of the most consequential votes that you will see Congress take over the past three years and the Obama administration,” Sanger said. “But this is, in Washington parlance, ‘winning ugly.’”

In the months since students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences made public their effort to unionize, University President Drew G. Faust has made it clear that she is opposed to the movement.
In April, several GSAS students confirmed that they were mobilizing to unionize—a move that could fundamentally alter the way graduate students interact with the University as teaching fellows. Led by graduate students Aaron T. Bekemeyer and Elaine F. Stranahan, members of the movement say a union will allow the them to use collective bargaining in negotiations and improve the complaint system at Harvard. 
Though Stranahan said in April she hoped the University and the students would “see eye-to-eye” on graduate student unionization, Harvard’s president has said that will not be the case.
“We really think that it's a mistake for graduate students to unionize, that it changes a mentoring relationship between faculty and students into a labor relationship, which it is not appropriate and is not what is represented by the experience of graduate students in the University,” Faust said in a May interview. “We do not support the unionization for graduate students.”
Since then, Faust has stood by her stance on graduate student unionization, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email Tuesday.
And legal precedent set by rulings on similar graduate student unionization efforts concur with Faust’s opinion. In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board determined that graduate students at Brown were classified as non-employees and were therefore not eligible to create a union. As a result, Harvard has no legal obligation to recognize a union, even if the graduate students at GSAS voted in the majority in favor of unionization.
Undeterred, Bekemeyer said he hoped that Faust would change her mind.
“Collective bargaining and a contract will give us a voice in the conditions of our work, real security, and tangible benefits like dental care, parental leave, affordable childcare, housing and transportation subsidies, and affordable benefits coverage for partners and dependents,” Bekemeyer wrote in an email Saturday.
Looking outside of the legal realm brings some promise for the GSAS students, as some graduate students have been able to form unions recognized by their universities. In 2013, New York University recognized a union of teaching and research assistants, the first in the country to be recognized by a private university, according to The New York Times.
Though Harvard’s graduate students face an uphill battle, they have said they are following pending unionization cases closely—most notably, a case brought to the NLRB by graduate students at Columbia, who in 2014 voted to establish a union that has not been recognized by the administration. Graduate students at Yale have also made efforts to unionize, but have not received recognition from the university.

Bars and restaurants in Harvard Square are seeing a surge in traffic from student patrons, and some students are speculating that it is partly the result of increased scrutiny surrounding Harvard’s off-campus social organizations and guest restrictions at at least one final club.
Mount Auburn Street, lined with several of the all-male and unrecognized social organizations, is usually bustling with crowds of students and the sounds of parties and dance music at the start of each academic year. But so far this term, the street has been largely quiet. While at least two final clubs hosted parties last weekend—the Spee and the Phoenix S.K. Clubs—others seemed to have their doors closed for much of it.
But students have flooded places in the Square such as Tasty Burger, which features a bar in its basement, and Felipe’s Taqueria, with a rooftop bar, on weekends, to the point that attendees have had to line up to enter.
According to Felipe’s co-owner Tom Brush, the bar-restaurant has seen near-capacity crowds on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, to the point of sometimes needing to assigning an employee to check I.D.s and limit the number of people on the roof. The roof has a capacity of 100 people.
Notably, Brush said some Harvard social clubs have even rented out the roof patio, which is relatively new.
“I wish it was bigger,” he added.
Brush is not alone in noting a surge in business. David A. DuBois, Tasty Burger’s owner, said he too has noticed increased business at the Harvard Square branch of the burger and beer chain.
“It does a feel a little busier this year,” DuBois said. “We have a pretty big following with the college crowd.”
While both establishments, along with other local eateries with bars such as Daedalus and Charlie’s Kitchen, are usually popular among students, some undergraduates suggest that restrictions on final clubs may be prompting students to look elsewhere for a place to socialize, and to a higher degree than in the past.
“If you’re talking about different parties and other social scenes on campus, they’re definitely more crowded this semester,” L. Mica Yoder ’16 said.
Felipe’s was recently renovated, so Yoder suggested that it is hard to tell if its surge in business is related to Harvard’s changing social scene, but she observed that other venues have been affected, such as what she sees as an increase in the incidence of parties within Harvard’s upperclassmen Houses.
She does not see that as a positive development.
“It’s pretty negative, because it makes the party then uncomfortable, and it means that people can’t enjoy social spaces on campus because of overcrowding,” Yoder said. “And it makes it more difficult to control and [there is] less space.”
For now, though, the weather is still warm and change seems to be in the air.
“A lot of people seem to be out and about recently,” Isabel R. Steinhaus ’18 said. “Maybe we’ll see—with restrictions on the final clubs this year—things start to change.”

UPDATED: September 9, 2015, at 1:19 p.m.
As students left campus for the summer, the College was not the only Harvard Square institution in flux. The makeup of businesses in the Square has seen substantial change since last spring as businesses leave, move in, and change locations.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, confirmed that Cabot’s Candy and the Boston Smoke Shop have opened up new storefronts in Harvard Square. The Maharaja reopened its doors after extensive repairs following a 2014 fire. The Harvard University Employees Credit Union is moving to Mt. Auburn Street, and Harvard Student Agencies' Cleaners location has moved from Holyoke Street also to Mt. Auburn Street. Sandrine’s Bistro, African Gift Items, Kennedy’s on the Square, and Berk’s Shoes all closed their doors.
Jillson added that these properties, some of which make up a series of vacant storefronts along JFK Street, are still in the process of finding new patrons. 
Cabot’s Candy opened on July 22 at 1300 Massachusetts Ave. sharing the location of Zinnia Jewelries. Jen Kurani, the owner of both shops, is excited to bring the Provincetown, Mass.-based candy shop to wider audiences.
“It’s a new location for us but we’re thrilled to ... bring our products here to Cambridge,” Kurani said. “We will continue to bring new products in, and it’s only a matter of time before we get a sense of the taste of folks in the Square.”
The shop prides itself on its New England appearance and taste. Along with other local confectioneries, Cabot sells its own line of candy produced at its factory in Provincetown.
Some changes to the Square were more bittersweet. After 35 years of business, Berk’s Shoes closed its doors. A patron for the property has not yet been publicly released.
“I come back and it’s not there anymore and that makes me sad,” said Anne Nguyen, a previous resident of Cambridge. “I always used to go to Berk’s ... they have quality comfortable shoes. It's hard to find those now.”
John C. Petrovato, owner of Raven Used Books, said that the store will continue to operate out of the current JFK Street location until the end of September. Raven Used Books plans on reopening at its new location on Church Street in October. Petrovato cited high rents on JFK Street as a reason for relocating.
“I have another store on Newbury, and the rents [in the Square] are in some cases higher,” Petrovato said. “Right now Harvard Square is very hot, so there’s almost no space available for under $10,000 [per month].”
Raven Used Books staff expressed excitement about the benefits of the new location. Employee J. Sterling Bryant said the new location will be about the same size, but better situated near Border Cafe and on street level.
“Church Street seems like it's on the up and up,” Bryant said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was nine o’clock on Tuesday night, and the Loker Reading Room in Widener Library was buzzing. Students sat in pairs, small groups, or even alone, as teaching fellows, identified by crimson lanyards and nametags swooped in to offer ready assistance.
These students were in Widener because the popular undergraduate course Computer Science 50 was granted permission to host its office hours there. Widener Library extended its own hours to host the group. This year, the library will remain open on weekdays until midnight, unlike its previous 10 p.m. closing time. CS50 office hours run from 9 p.m. until midnight.
“We’re very excited to be here,” said David J. Malan ’99, a Computer Science professor of the practice who teaches the course. “This is a good way of easing into the new space,” he added, saying that the number of students was slightly greater than what typically arises for the office hours for the first problem set.
All around the room, activity abounded and noise bounced off of Loker’s iconic aqua and rosette-tiled ceiling. Designated CS50 greeters stood in the center of the room, holding stacks of information sheets. “Are you here for CS50 office hours?” each one asked with enthusiasm, as bewildered students nodded and promptly took their seats at the sturdy wooden tables.
“This is actually my first time studying here,” said Emily Siwachok, a Divinity School student studying in the space prior to the arrival of CS50. “And there’s lots of chatter and people helping people.”
Only 20 minutes into the night, two students nudged the leather-studded doors to the reading room, peered their heads in, mumbled something to one another, and quickly left. “This is CS50 office hours,” one muttered on the way out.
Many freshmen acknowledged that CS50 office hours marked the first time they set foot in Widener. Alexis Zapien ’19, at one table, said Tuesday was the first night he ever attended office hours. “I think it’s really cool that such a large group of people can come together…[It’s] a bonding experience.”
Two tables down, Matthew J. Sciamanna ’19 had just returned to his laptop. Armed with a half-eaten peanut butter sandwich and a disposable mug from the Brain Break set up in Widener’s basement cafeteria, he said he never has been to the library before the course’s office hours. “It’s really ridiculously beautiful,” he said. “Are there office hours for every class in here?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week into living in the College’s newly renovated Dunster House, undergraduates are both satisfied with the new and updated amenities and critical of living situations that feature hallway bathrooms and lack private common spaces.
Late afternoon Tuesday, students lounged around the House’s newly expanded common spaces, in the historic dining hall and its new seminar rooms and near the building’s grille.
Aran K. Kirschenmann ’18, sitting on a bench swing in the House’s riverside courtyard, glanced at her linkmate, a Mather House resident, and said she thinks Dunster is more aesthetically pleasing than other Houses nearby. It now features hardwood paneling and stone floors, among other 21st century additions.
The consensus among students is that the renovation has improved the physical look of and even their attitudes toward Dunster, the first full House to undergo construction as part of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project, a priority in the University’s ongoing capital campaign. Previously, Dunster was widely regarded as a less desirable residence at the College, largely because of its walkthrough bedrooms and old age.
They also praised its new layout, with long hallways and interspersed elevators that connect each floor, rather than the vertical entryways that characterize other River Houses.
Students, though, are not sold on every aspect of the renovation. In particular, the addition of hallway bathrooms to the House has elicited conflicting reactions. While they are cleaned regularly, some students complained that certain bathrooms are more crowded than others.
“It just so happened that we ended up with a hallway bathroom that has one toilet and one shower for all nine girls on our floor,” Nia S. Walker ’16 said. “There are two guys on our floor in a double who have a men’s hallway bathroom, and it has two toilets and two showers.”
Living arrangements also vary significantly from resident to resident. Single and double bedrooms that lack private common space—a feature of other renovated buildings that had drawn mixed reactions from students—populate parts of the House, though there are also suites for six, seven, and eight people that are popular among upperclassmen. Those suites include private common rooms and some even include private bathrooms.
Andree R. Werner ’16, who lives in a seven-person suite in Dunster, said this new arrangement has prompted her and her roommates to reconsider their role in the House’s social life.
“I think it’s on the job of the students to create a nice social space in the suites that do have big common rooms to make it an inclusive social space,” Werner said. “It might not be their friends or people from their rooms, but people from Dunster who are in standalone singles or doubles don’t have that same social space.”
Several students interviewed said it is too early to tell what impact the House’s new setup will have on its social scene. Some students suggest that Dunster already had a reputation for lacking a vibrant party scene, given that there are restrictions on when at night non-residents of the House can swipe in to enter.
“I don’t think Dunster was ever particularly a party House,” David L. Wang ’16 said. “We’re not like Eliot. We don’t have the Cockpit or Ground Zero. We don’t have party suites.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her most extensive public comments to date on the topic of single-gender social clubs at the College, University President Drew G. Faust put Harvard’s final clubs on notice Tuesday. She said in an interview that she and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana are weighing options to address issues of exclusivity, sexual assault, and alcohol use that she associated with the clubs.
“I know [Khurana has] been meeting with them and I have discussed with him the concerns that he’s expressed,” Faust said in an interview in her Massachusetts Hall corner office. “You know we’ve had a lot of concerns about alcohol and final clubs, safety in final clubs, we’ve worried a lot about sexual assault in final clubs, and so I think a lot of these issues that are very much at the heart of our considerations about undergraduate life have a special valence and relationship to the final clubs.”
The comments come in Faust’s eighth year as president, but during a time when the clubs are under increased scrutiny from students and administrators alike. At least two final clubs hosted parties over Labor Day weekend—the Spee Club and the Phoenix S.K. Club— but others seemed to have their doors closed for much of it, and the Fox Club is continuing to enforce a members-only policy. Other clubs have discussed adopting such a policy with "more frequency" in recent years, according to Fly Graduate Board President John L. Powers ’70.
Undergraduate presidents of several all-male final clubs could not be reached or declined to comment on Tuesday night.
Harvard does not officially recognize final clubs or Greek organizations, but many flourish outside of the University’s gates, leading College officials to keep up some relationship with the organizations, which are a social focal point for hundreds of students. In the past year, that relationship has become increasingly precarious as Khurana has ramped up criticism of final clubs, meeting with undergraduate and graduate board members behind the scenes. He has also publicly reprimanded the clubs at times, including last spring when the Spee Club circulated a party invitation that some women on campus deemed sexist.
Faust confirmed that Khurana has been meeting with club representatives and said she has been in close consultation with him. When it comes to final clubs, Khurana’s stance is clear: “The College continues to support the idea that … single-gendered organizations are not appropriate for the College,” he said last spring.
Faust did not go so far as to flat out denounce single-gender social organizations on Tuesday, but she explicitly questioned whether the clubs fit into Harvard’s undergraduate social scene.
“If we’re going to talk about reaching out beyond who we are, to embrace difference and discomfort ourselves and include people very different from ourselves in the lives we lead, and make a community that embraces the wide range of people here at the College, I think those ideals are sitting uneasily with the segregation of certain groups, the self-segregation of certain groups into final clubs,” she said.
Harvard severed official ties with its all-male final clubs in 1984, and to this day, it remains unaffiliated with them and the five female final clubs, five fraternities, and four sororities that Harvard students populate. Students, though, are still allowed to join them, unlike at Amherst, which prohibited students from being part of fraternities, sororities, or equivalents in 2014.
Faust did not rule out the possibility of Harvard pursuing a similar action, but said the current conversations with the clubs are “in the mode of trying to come to outcomes that represent the students themselves taking responsibility for the future that we all, I think, together, want to see.”
Last year, Harvard’s unrecognized social scene showed only signs of growth, as a record number of women rushed Harvard’s sororities, students added a new fraternity, and the male and female final clubs put up for entry, or “punched,” new classes.
Khurana is scheduled to meet with final club graduate board leaders later in the month, according to Fly graduate board president Powers, who is also a former Crimson sports editor. It remains unclear what the group will discuss. For the time being, though, Faust has made it clear she is behind her College dean.
“As we broaden the reach of the College to individuals from much more diverse economic backgrounds, as we emphasize the need for inclusion of all groups, to have certain groups that can dispense privilege and advantage in very significant ways that exclude individuals from membership is very troubling,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust is refocusing Harvard’s $6.5 billion capital campaign two years after its launch. She said Tuesday that she wants to target future fundraising at campaign priorities that have not yet attracted major giving.
“We’re going to refocus our energies on the aspects of the campaign that haven’t entirely met the aspirations that we had for them,” she said in an interview, specifically mentioning fundraising efforts at the Graduate School of Education, Harvard Divinity School, and Harvard Medical School. 
Launched publicly in September 2013, Harvard’s record-setting fundraising drive has already raised more than $5 billion in gifts and pledges. The campaign has articulated a number of goals, including financial aid, developing a science complex in Allston, and College House renewal.
Since administrators last released campaign numbers early this year, Harvard has taken in a record-breaking $400 million pledge. If the University continued to fundraise at a level consistent with its pre-public phase pace, the campaign total would now be in the area of $6 billion.
“We’ve done really, really well,” Faust said. “We’ve had another terrific year, and so we’re very excited about all we’ve accomplished with the campaign.”
Occasionally, when institutions near their targets ahead of schedule, they raise their targets to encourage more giving. For Columbia’s most recent capital campaign that ended in 2013, the university’s trustees increased its goal four years in from $4 billion to $5 billion. But on Tuesday, Faust said Harvard administrators have no plans to raise their goal.
Faust said she wants to focus on the Ed School because it got off to a late fundraising start as it underwent a leadership transition around the launch of the campaign. Faust also said she has higher hopes for the Divinity School, which does not have as many donors in financially lucrative professions compared to other schools. She added that she wants to “drill down” on the Medical School, which recently revamped its curriculum.
One way Faust has incentivized big-ticket gifts is by allowing donors to rename the schools to which they direct their money. Gerald L. Chan bought naming rights to the School of Public Health for $350 million, renaming it in honor of his father T.H. Chan, and it took a $400 million gift—the largest donation in Harvard’s history—from hedge fund mogul John A. Paulson to rename the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“As we thought about the possibility of these naming gifts we wanted to make sure that these gifts could have a transformative effect that would be worthy of long-term recognition,” she said.
Not everyone condones giving to the world’s richest university. Criticism erupted after news of the $400 million Paulson gift, arguing that the money exacerbates the wealth inequality in higher education and could better serve other causes. In her interview with The Crimson, Faust addressed critics of the campaign, saying that many of them are ill-informed about how endowments work. Harvard is not hoarding money in its $35.9 billion endowment, she said, because it often receives donations allocated to specific professorships or programs.
“One of the things that I found most disturbing about those criticisms is that first of all it’s an act of extraordinary generosity. [Paulson] is not spending his millions on something frivolous,” Faust said. “To be greeted with such skepticism and criticism for an act of generosity seems to me to be unfair and extreme.”
With three more years to go in the campaign's public phase, Faust seems determined not to lose steam on the fundraising drive. Yet as the capital campaign charges along, there are still not plans to raise its goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For followers of the Harvard women’s volleyball team, it would surprise few that, even during a weekend in which the team dropped two contests, junior setter Corie Bain still stood out—not just among her teammates, but across the entire campus.
In the team’s first game of the season, Bain showed Rutgers why she earned a unanimous bid to the All-Ivy first team in her sophomore season. The third-year star recorded a triple-double in her first game of the season, leading her squad to a straight-set win over the Scarlet Knights and earning her The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week honors.
Down four points in the second set of the match, Bain trotted back to the far side of the Malkin Athletic Center with the serve in her control. Seven straight times, Bain leaped and sent the ball over the net with such topspin as to immediately take the air out of any counterattack and put Rutgers on the defensive. Seven straight times, the Crimson scored, taking the second set and squashing any momentum the Scarlet Knights may have had.
“That was awesome and it really set the tone for the match,” co-captain Hannah Schmidt said. “We weren’t going to let [Rutgers] come back in control of that game.”
None of this is new territory for the Manhattan Beach, Calif. native. She already holds the career Ivy League record for triples-doubles and double-doubles with almost two full seasons left to play. The five-time Rookie of the Week and Player of the Week in the Ivy League also holds the Harvard record for single-season aces in a season, with 50 in her freshman year.
Bain’s 11 kills, 24 assists, and 10 digs set the pace for the Crimson in its opener that featured several new faces. Two freshmen—Anna Uhr and Christina Cornelius—started for Harvard, while sophomores Paige Kebe and Caroline Labanowski received serious playing time after taking mostly bench roles in their first years with the team. Only five players who regularly saw playing time last year found the floor for the Crimson on Friday.
“Although we have four senior players who play consistently, I think that having a spread of players from all four classes really demonstrates [our] depth,” Schmidt said.
The team is without the services of senior Jennifer Shults this season after she was unable to rejoin the team for her final year of eligibility due to injury.
“We’re working through this,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “We can’t tell yet how exactly this will impact our team.”
Notably absent from the Friday game was fellow junior Grace Weghorst, who dealt with nagging injuries last year on the team’s way to the Ivy League championship. She played sparingly during the 2015 Harvard Invitational this weekend, only seeing the court in one game.
Bain’s burden, therefore, was bigger than it usually was during the season, not being able to lean on the former All-Ivy first team selection Weghorst. On Saturday, she was still able to cause a little trouble for Illinois State, recording a double-double with 12 assists and 12 digs in a straight-set loss.
After two award-winning seasons with the team, the question now is how much can Bain improve on her already-high level of play. During the span of the Harvard Invitational, the 5’11” psychology concentrator also managed to record seven blocks at the net. It’s clear Bain’s play will be a key indicator of how well Harvard fares in the Ivy League this year.
“We’re striving to be a team that finishes games and finishes matches,” Schmidt said. “[Corie’s] serving run really got it going again and motivated the team to go all the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team opened its season with a loss against Holy Cross but bounced back later in the weekend with a strong win against Bryant.
On Friday the visiting Crimson (1-1) received unexpected resistance from the Crusaders (2-2), who defeated the Crimson for only the second time in the programs’ 17 all-time meetings. Three days later, led by a hat trick from junior forward Marissa Balleza, the Crimson recovered with a 5-2 victory over the Bulldogs (1-4) at Jordan Field.
HARVARD 5, BRYANT 2
Balleza scored the first three goals of Harvard’s home opener to record her second career hat trick. The junior forward’s outburst proved to be the difference in an offensively uneven contest, as a one-goal first half gave way to a six-goal second frame.
After an early wide shot three minutes in, Balleza first beat Bryant goaltender Marissa Elizardo at 5:16 in the first half. The junior forward followed the strike with two goals less than three minutes apart after the break, at 37:15 and 40:13.
Senior defender Elizabeth Jacobson assisted on all three of Balleza’s strikes before Victoria Danby put Bryant on the board at 49:55, yet sophomore Harvard midfielder Ellie Cookson responded, threading an unassisted backhand shot through Elizardo’s five-hole at 57:55.
After a goal by Bronwyn Walker again drew Bryant within two at 63:04, freshman forward Kathleen Young consolidated the Crimson’s win less than a minute later with her first career collegiate goal.
Harvard’s first victory of 2015 was physical throughout. A total of 41 fouls were committed during the game, 17 of which were Bryant fouls.
“I think Bryant is a very physical team,” said junior defender Sophie van Weede. “I still felt like we kept our composure and tried to defend as cleanly as we possibly could.”
HOLY CROSS 2, HARVARD 1
In a low scoring affair, the Crusaders secured a two-goal lead early in the second half before holding off a late Crimson surge. After attempting only one shot in the first half, Harvard put seven toward the net in the second yet broke through only once.
The offense on both sides was slow to develop on Friday, with the first shot coming nearly a quarter of the way through the game. The Crusaders’ Michelle McNeil collected a rebound off of senior goalkeeper Issy Davies and found the back of the net at 16:55.
The second half began with two shots by Young, who forced Holy Cross goaltender Megan Inch to make her first save of the game. The Crusaders proceeded to work down the field and earn a corner kick, on which sophomore forward Maureen Connolly capitalized with a successful deflection at 42:36.
Balleza broke through on the Crimson’s fifth shot of the half with just under 10 minutes remaining, yet the visitors could not find the equalizer in time. Inch turned away an attempt by Jacobson at 62:42, and the hosts held the advantage in possession over the game’s final seven minutes.
“Our team has great passing patterns when we really connect and we attack the circle really well but there were lapses in our communication and our focus,” sophomore midfielder Hannah Wellington said. “We saw the passes, but someone would mess up a trap and that slowed down our momentum and made it more difficult than [the game] had to be.”
Under the direction of a new head coach and with three games already under their belt, the Crusaders defended their cage with confidence on Friday. The Crimson, meanwhile, contended with opening-day nerves.
“Part of it was first-game jitters,” said van Weede. “The first game is always tricky, everyone needs to get used to the freshmen, the communication…. I think we were definitely better, but we didn’t come out with what we wanted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a winning 2014 campaign, the Harvard men’s water polo team ran up against elite competition in its opening weekend at the Bruno Classic.
Over the two-day competition, which included games at both Brown’s Katherine Moran Aquatics Center and Harvard’s Blodgett Pool, Harvard (1-2) dropped contests against No. 19 Bucknell (2-2) and No. 4 Stanford (5-0) on Saturday but rebounded with a win against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (2-3) on Sunday.
HARVARD 12, CLAREMONT-M-S 10
Three unanswered goals in the second quarter proved to be the difference in Harvard’s first win of the season, a 12-10 victory over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in Providence.
In the seventh all-time meeting between the Crimson and the Stags, senior attacker Blake Lee led the Crimson offense with five goals, beginning with two in the second quarter. Lee’s first goal broke a 2-2 stalemate, and his next provided Harvard’s final lead of the game.
A third quarter push by Claremont resulted in a one-goal game, yet the Crimson held on in the final minutes. Lee contributed another pair of goals, and co-captain Ben Zepfel netted three to protect Harvard’s lead.
On defense, freshman Nick Bunn made a game-saving block and steal to prevent the Stags from tying the game. Freshman goalie Anthony Ridgley recorded 10 saves.
“Throughout preseason, we put in a ton of hours towards both our conditioning and skill work, which gave us confidence and excitement heading into the weekend,” Bunn said.
STANFORD 21, HARVARD 5
After an early goal by the Crimson, the Cardinal rallied with an 8-0 run and never lost the lead in Harvard’s home opener at Blodgett Pool. Coming off a 30-9 victory over MIT earlier in the day, Stanford continued the offensive onslaught with five goals from Kyle Weikert and four apiece from senior Bret Bonani and junior redshirt Adam Abdulhamid.
Harvard’s margin of defeat was its largest since a 20-2 loss to Pepperdine in 2011.
“Overall, we can agree that we didn't perform to the standards we set for ourselves heading in,” Bunn said. “We struggled to follow the tactics and goals we wanted to accomplish, causing some unwanted issues before eventually losing the game.”
Zepfel, junior co-captain Joey Colton, and senior attacker Noah Harrison all scored in the first half. Freshmen two-meter defender Grant Harvey and attacker Grayson Judge contributed in the second half with their first career goals.
HARVARD 10, BUCKNELL 8
In Harvard’s season opener in Providence, the Crimson held steady with the Bison at eight goals apiece through three quarters before being held scoreless in the final period. Juniors Sean Daley and R.J. Moore scored the fourth quarter difference-makers for Bucknell, while senior Stefan Aleksic led the Bison with a hat trick.
Harrison, meanwhile, contributed three goals for the Crimson. The performance was encouraging for the senior, who missed the 2014 season due to injury. Junior two-meter defender Dan Stevens also contributed a goal to give the Crimson a 3-2 lead after the first quarter.
The second quarter saw the Bisons take the lead, but goals from Chiapello, Colton, Bunn and freshman attacker Nathan Ondracek tied the game by the end of the third quarter.
“As a team we did not play remotely close to our full potential,” Harvey said. “But as our coach Ted Minnis tells us, ‘The season is like a staircase, you start at the bottom and have to just start climbing’.... It’s not where you start, but where you finish, and we want to finish on top.”

Happy Almost Study Card Due Day! Study cards are due tomorrow at 5 p.m., which means we’re all probably scrambling right now to get our “advising hold” “lifted” so that we can finally “enroll” in our classes and not just “validate” them. The fact that study cards are due soon also sadly reminds us of the fact that blissful shopping week is over and we unfortunately cannot put off doing homework because the “oh, maybe I’m not actually taking this class so I won’t do the reading just in case since I have better things to do with my life” excuse just doesn’t fly anymore.
