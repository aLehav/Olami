After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to be patriotic at Harvard.
Socially, it’s the kind of pressure that would make you shy away from throwing a U.S.A.-themed party or posting a purely celebratory post on the Fourth of July or Memorial Day. It’s the fear that there will be backlash, the fear of being asked, “How could you celebrate such a flawed country?”
Academically, it’s the kind of pressure that makes you couch any kind of praise of the U.S. with critique. The formula is as follows: “So yeah, the U.S. has provided the most extensive source of humanitarian aid in the history of the world … but it’s a horribly imperialist enterprise.” Swap imperialist with racist, sexist, homophobic, undemocratic, and hateful at your leisure.
It’s not that I don’t think the U.S. has been culpable for some instances of imperialism, racism, sexism, homophobia, or hatefulness. Hell, I’m sure we've done it all.
But we’ve also done plenty of good and are founded on principles that assume the equality and dignity of every citizen; I believe that we’re, overall, a force for good. Past and present transgressions aren’t reasons not to love the country.
Patriotism is a tricky, misconstrued feeling. David Brooks’s recent column post notes that flawed perceptions of patriotism often create an ingroup and outgroup, rather than one nation. Nationalism, the kind you see on the far right, isn't patriotism because it defines an American as one (predominantly white) thing, therefore creating an outgroup. There also tends to be a performative type of patriotism on the right: The U.S.A.-chanting, MAGA-hat-wearing patriotism, which doesn't amount to any concrete policy or mission of unity.
The extreme “wokeism” of the far left isn't patriotism either. It demands conformity to progressive ideals and shuns of any trace of American pride. It’s an exercise in shame, one that requires a “true American” to live in a state of constant penance, and is a strain of thought that permeates many of Harvard’s political and academic circles. It’s a classic Harvard problem — complain, but don’t fix; ostracize, but don’t engage.
Oddly enough, I learned the true meaning of patriotism in high school theology class. Sister Mary would speak of the different types of love, identifying “agape” love as love’s truest, purest expression. It’s understood as the unselfish love that God and humans have for one another. It’s both the highest form of love and the most difficult to achieve.
If we embrace agape love, we choose a tough love. We choose to accept someone or something's flaws, and love through them.
An agape love of country is a healing love. It means accepting the sins of the nation but loving it anyway, in hopes of mending the nation’s open wounds. It’s a risky bet because agape is reciprocal. That means that there is a constant hope that in loving the nation, it will love you back.
Patriotism, for me, is as complicated as the country it calls us to love. It’s an understanding of America’s faults but a commitment to fixing them. It means you’ll have to see the ugly — much like you do if you are a parent, or a spouse, or even a friend — and embrace it out of hope and out of duty. Brooks writes, “Sometimes caring for America brings moral shame.”
But the question remains: Why love the country in the first place?
I could embark on an epic soliloquy about the values of democracy, individualism, freedom (picture an American flag waving in the background, an eagle soaring). I could tell you that my mother is an immigrant who has built a life in this country. I could expound on the American dream and the opportunities extended to each citizen. But, while I personally believe all these things to an extent, they fall prey to common critiques, which I see as often too simplified. Not everyone is free, not everyone gets equal opportunities, not everyone can immigrate or build a life.
So I’ll leave you with my most basic reason for why I choose to love this country: It’s where I live.
I want where I live to thrive, I want it to be just and righteous. And without first loving it, it will never succeed. Because if we don’t approach the country with love, even tough love, we won’t be able to have a better outcome for all, only for some.
American Harvard students have an immense responsibility to love their country. Our education is a privilege and a key to power. We go on to be CEOs, senators, presidents, even. Lately, there’s been discussion about how a Harvard education or affiliation has been abused, specifically by lawmakers that endorsed views that undermined democracy. The critique is empty, however, if it isn't followed up by a renewed call for patriotism. Where is the apologetic shame getting us? We point fingers and sow seeds of division, never channeling our talents and privilege towards unifying and healing.
Brooks writes that America is “a tradition of conflict about our very foundations.” It’s a tradition of civic disagreement through thoughtful debate and participation in public forums and community activities.
This thoughtful discussion no longer exists at Harvard. For one, outright “civic engagement” has become nearly impossible unless you fit a mainstream liberal ideology. Even academically, professors are finding themselves constricted, banding together to fight back against an onslaught on academic freedom. When students can’t openly disagree and professors can’t teach unpopular findings, there will no longer be a “tradition of conflict.”
As an exceedingly “progressive” institution, Harvard errs on the side of dismissing America as irredeemable and therefore not worth engaging. Love of country becomes a fault, not a virtue. This love is the exact opposite of agape — it only occurs when everything is right and just. It evaporates when the going gets tough, leaving wounds to fester and groups to drift further and further apart.
So let’s consider a Harvard where patriotism is encouraged, even when injustice abounds.
This is a Harvard where the student body celebrates Memorial Day and Veterans Day, while students thoughtfully discuss the mistakes the U.S. military has made in their classes. This is a Harvard where American students don’t have to temper their pride in the country, especially around their international peers. This is a Harvard where students learn about the strides the country has made in bridging racial inequalities, while remaining committed to solving the lingering issues of systemic racism.
It’s a Harvard where I can openly proclaim that I love my country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is perhaps no topic in American society as contentious as the issue of race. So, it’s no surprise that the intersection of race and college admissions has ignited firestorm after firestorm since the introduction of race-based affirmative action in the 1960s. In more recent years, Harvard’s own admissions system has come under particular scrutiny for how it weighs a students’ racial identity, particularly in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard lawsuit.
While the courts have decided in Harvard’s favor so far, the public debate surrounding affirmative action is nowhere near over. What does affirmative action mean for the students who actually occupy the identities under discussion? How do students think about their many identities as former applicants, but also as stakeholders in the Harvard community?
In light of this renewed conversation on affirmative action, I spoke with students of color about how affirmative action and their identities impact the way they move through Harvard.
As children dotted in and out of the Zoom window, I spoke with Claira Janover ’21 — the former president of the Harvard Half Asian People’s Association, who’s currently living with her chosen family in Jackson, Wyo. While I tense up every time the topic of affirmative action is introduced in conversation, Janover seemed in her element, detailing her views on the subject and the finer points of the history of affirmative action. Her mother, who taught African American history and gender studies, introduced her to race consciousness from a young age.
In Janover’s view, to completely ignore race in admissions is to tacitly accept and endorse the racial dynamic of our society at large: to her, an unacceptable alternative to Harvard’s flawed but necessary affirmative action program.
But what was most revelatory about Janover’s story was her understanding of her own identity. Janover, who grew up in New Haven, Conn. with her Jewish mother, was “bat mitzvah-ed” and thought of herself as a “white person who happened to be Asian,” until being introduced to new dimensions of the Asian American experience in college. Far from being static, Janover’s understanding of her identity has been evolving as she experiences new facets of life as a biracial woman.
Janover’s story, although uniquely her own, represents the hope and the limitations of affirmative action. Identity, whether it be racial identity or any other, exists only as a collection of iterations of unique individual experiences. There is no unified experience of being Asian American, or of being Black or of any other ethnic group that can be captured by quotas.
Thu M. Pham ’23 and Truong L. Nguyen ’23, co-presidents of the Harvard Vietnamese Association, shared similar sentiments of being Asian American and endorsing affirmative action. While supportive of the program as a whole, the pair isn’t indifferent to the way Asian American applicants are treated in the admissions office: They want admissions officers to honor Harvard College’s commitment to diversity while respecting the humanity of the Asian American students who apply. In Nguyen’s words, consideration of a student’s race “should only be used to add more into the narrative” of a student’s identity, and never to detract from their admissibility.
Eric Reyes-Muñoz ’23 shared how his Hispanic American identity was shaped by life in his primarily white town, which was nonetheless awash with diversity.
Raised in suburban South Jersey, Reyes-Muñoz — a first-generation American and college student, co-president of Harvard Undergraduate Latinx in Finance and Technology, and Crimson business associate — paints a picture of his life like something out of what I would imagine the American dream is supposed to be.
He said he felt comfortable navigating the racial boundaries that fracture American life with ease. His realized American dream has included friends and mentors of different backgrounds supporting and uplifting each other in the name of community. That said, even though Reyes-Muñoz’s life so far has been reflective of the best parts of the American experience, he is acutely aware of his role as the role model he never had for the next generation of Hispanic Americans interested in finance and STEM careers. Reyes-Muñoz said that, at Harvard, “being different makes me similar” because of the diversity of backgrounds people attending come from.
There is diversity in every community as long as someone is willing to look for it, but to look at the United States and ignore racial diversity while prizing other forms of diversity does a tremendous disservice to the students who come to Harvard College looking to expand their world view. Our debate surrounding affirmative action is fundamentally flawed when we contrast race-based affirmative action with “race-neutral” alternatives because race-neutrality does not exist in the context of a world in which racial categories were socially constructed to be important.
Yet, affirmative action need not be anathema to our belief in individualism because every individual has a unique experience with race that inflects our community with invaluable experience.
For Harvard, or any other school for that matter, to be “race-neutral” would not mean that race would not impact admissions, but that in place of an aspirational vision of an equitable society, the current racial status quo would select future incoming classes before admissions officers ever have a chance to read over applications.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard may be eligible to receive nearly $25.5 million in aid from the latest federal stimulus package, according to an analysis published Monday by the American Council on Education, a higher education interest group.
President Joe Biden’s signature stimulus bill, which has been dubbed the “American Rescue Plan,” allocates just under $40 billion in relief funds to thousands of colleges and universities to cover pandemic-related expenses.
The bill — which Biden signed into law March 11 — stipulates that the government will prioritize relief funds to institutions with endowments of less than $1 million. Regardless, Harvard remains eligible to receive funds, even though the University’s endowment is valued at $41.9 billion.
Funding allocations will be determined based on several factors, including the number of students receiving Pell Grants, the number of students enrolled full-time, and the number of students enrolled exclusively online at the beginning of the pandemic.
Though the previous round of emergency relief for higher education placed restrictions on allocations to universities subject to the endowment tax, the latest bill does not impose the same constraints. Institutions that paid the endowment tax in 2019 — those with at least 500 students and at least $500,000 in assets per student — had allocations reduced by 50 percent in the relief bill passed by Congress in December 2020.
The bill as written would distribute significantly more aid than the $9 million and $7 million that Harvard was eligible to receive from the March and December bills, respectively.
In April 2020, Harvard ultimately rejected the $9 million it was eligible for after receiving backlash from then-President Donald Trump and several members of Congress.
The University decided not to seek funding from the second stimulus package, citing concerns that uneven guidelines in December’s relief funding would have deprived undocumented students of aid.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on whether Harvard plans to accept the latest round of funding.
“The University is reviewing the legislation and its implementation at this time,” Newton wrote in an email.
The Department of Education has not yet released official guidance for allocating the relief funds. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
