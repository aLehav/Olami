“Color is a matter of taste and sensitivity,” said Edouard Manet, the 19th century French painter. Yet, as “Manet in Black” at the Museum of Fine Arts demonstrates, the absence of color provides just as much opportunity for preference and subtlety. The show displays none of Manet’s paintings and instead focuses on his smaller etchings and lithographs, many of which are in the museum’s own collection. Included in the exhibit are illustrations from Manet’s collaborations with poets, including  illustrations for Stéphane Mallarmé’s French translation of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” and many depictions of the same subjects featured in some of Manet’s most famous paintings. The variety of works is intended to reveal a lesser-known—but no less personal and creative—side of the man credited with the invention of modern art.
Manet’s monochromic etchings and lithographs, which contain rich varieties of texture and line quality, relate thematically to his paintings. Though his paintings do incorporate colors, they also emphasize his interest in strong tonal composition and contrast. “He is an artist who is quite interested in black and gray as colors, so its interesting how that goes into his print making,” says Henri Zerner, a professor in the Department of History of Art and Architecture. The lithographs, Zerner believes, are particularly spectacular and coherent with Manet’s general oeuvre. “Obviously they’re not a major aspect of his work—he is above all a painter—but they are quite significant, and he is a wonderful printmaker.”
The sleek, black theme of the show is also a reflection of the culture in which Manet lived and worked. In the introductory plaque at the exhibit, curator Helen Burnham explains how Manet’s friend and contemporary Charles Baudelaire called black the color of the 19th century, referencing the period’s culture, art and fashion. It is also a reflection of Manet’s own lifestyle. “He was a fairly elegant fellow himself. He wasn’t exactly a bohemian,” says Clifford S. Ackley, the chair of the Prints, Drawings and Photographs Department at the MFA.
According to Ackley, one of the primary goals of the exhibit is to broaden the general public’s view of Manet as not just a painter but also a talented printmaker and illustrator. “It’s a side of Manet that many people don’t know,” he says. Ackley thinks that this side also demonstrates another significant facet of Manet’s innovative nature. “He was very inventive with lithography, like ‘The Races’ or ‘The Barricade,’ which have extremely juicy use of lithographic crayon and are very expressive,” he says. Devoting a show solely to these smaller works, Zerner points out, is vital for their recognition, as they would otherwise get lost alongside Manet’s larger paintings.
Not only do the works present a lesser-known side of Manet, they also present a more intimate reflection of the artist’s work, some feel. Matthew R. Saunders, a visiting lecturer in the Department of Visual and Enviromental Studies, believes the visual artists of Manet’s era often worked hand-in-hand with the publishing industry. “Most of them got involved at some level with graphic arts, whether it was paying the bills by making illustrations for the newspapers or publishing prints as another way to circulate your work and to make money,” he says. Saunders thinks that showing these types of works gives the audience more of a sense of the day-to-day lives of the artist. “I’m certainly always interested in seeing that it’s really what he spent most of his days doing, probably,” Saunders said.
The show includes several paintings by artists who were influences on or contemporaries of Manet. Works by Edgar Degas, Felix Bracquemond, and Rembrandt van Rijn hang alongside works by Manet that are similar in content or technique. This context for Manet’s work emphasizes the contrast between the element of tradition present in Manet’s work and the creative ways in which he broke with that tradition. “You both understand the line of thought better and you see the differences between different hands and minds, different artists at work on the same topic, and that is more revealing than just walking around and admiring a bunch of great looking Manet paintings,” Saunders says. Though it is not the sort of “blockbuster” show, as Saunders puts it, which is more common for such pivotal artists like Manet, “Manet in Black” is an insightful presentation of a more understated portion of Manet’s body of work.

Since long before the era of so-called “globalization,” different nations have been commingling. Alexander the Great and his successors founded Greek cities in Afghanistan, and Arab traders set up enclaves in cities from China to Kenya. Cultural cross-fertilization has been going on for centuries, and as people travel and interact with each other they create pieces of art that draw from disparate roots and blossom into something  unique. One of the latest in a long line of transnational artistic conversations, the show “Orient/Occident” at the New England Conservatory on Saturday explored the connection between eastern and western music through the subjective experience of the different musicians.
The performance was organized by Tanya Kalmanovitch, the assistant chair of the Department of Contemporary Improvisation at the NEC. Her department focuses on teaching its students performance and improvisation drawn from a wide range of musical styles. “Every year, I produce a concert that largely features student-led projects,” she says. “But because our department has such a broad constituency, choosing a theme for the concert can be an interesting challenge.” Kalmanovitch, who is an accomplished violinist in her own right, also studies music known as “exotica” that comes from non-western counties but is represented—or more often misrepresented—in western musical forms. This academic interest helped to inform the theme of the “Orient/Occident” project. “What I was interested in doing was [to] have people examine these lenses that we use but never really think about,” she says.
The idea for the concert grew out of the experiences that Kalmanovitch had teaching music in Afghanistan alongside NEC doctoral student and instructor Eden L. MacAdam-Somer. “We were doing a concert at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul when I got an email from one of my students, Yasmine, who was in Tunis in the middle of the Jasmine Revolution,” Kalmanovitch said. This direct interaction between the NEC community and other nations influenced the conception of ‘Orient/Occident.’
Some of the music in “Orient/Occident” was inspired by this sense of travel and displacement. MacAdam-Somer played with this idea in her piece “Going to the West,” a song that connects the stories of an Indian couple, an Afghani orphan, and MacAdam-Somer’s own move to Ohio as a child. “It is bluegrass combined with music from Afghanistan that my students had taught me when I was over there,” she says. “For every musician, it is really important to draw on your own life experiences. It is something that is really important about our program here.” Her piece combined a traditional American form with Afghan themes played on the sitar, a traditional Indian stringed instrument, and featured lyrics that discuss her experiences as a child moving to a town that did not have any Jews outside her family.
“Orient/Occident” was not just a vehicle for exposing the western notion of the east. It also offered a chance for Middle Eastern students to reflect on their homeland’s recent history. “As you know, Tunisia was the first country to kick out its dictator, and right now, one year on, it’s a total nightmare” says Yasmine Aziez, a Tunisian violinist who studies at NEC. “I’ve just been back to Tunis, and I go back very often. And I just wanted to do a piece that was meaningful that incorporated the happiness and the sadness felt one year after the Revolution.” Her piece incorporated melodies from famous North African musicians such as Umm Kalthum, as well as themes characteristic of Arabian orchestras.
Rachel Panitch, a violinist at NEC, composed a piece based on the similarity she heard between the chants of the protesters in Tahrir Square and those of American stadiums during sporting events. “Most of our focus was around how these four violins can create a crowd and also the individual voices within it,” she says. During her performance, four violinists chose themes to play from a list of pre-determined melodies. These themes were interwoven with each other like independent voices coming together to create the roar of the crowd. “Everyone was making choices about what they were going to play, and all of a sudden we were all playing the same thing,” she says.
For people like MacAdam-Somer, it is this diversity in both students and musical styles that makes NEC such a dynamic place to work and study. “It is so great that we have concerts like that where no two things are the same—where everything is different,” she says.

For us older folk, Magic: The Gathering—a fantasy-themed trading card game created in 1993—is a mature, strategic affair (or at least, as mature and strategic as any game featuring battling dragons and unicorns can be), played in dusty card shops nationwide. Playgroups vary, but the groups I have played with tend to be 20-something geeky dudes with ego to spare. Magic, in these circles, is as serious as a varsity sport. I would know: In high school, I spent hours crafting decks and researching strategies in hopes of ascending to Magic fame.
But there are always some ten-year-olds who wander into the shop, itching to play without knowing how. It is generally either mortifying or awkward when you are placed across the table from them. On the one hand, it looks bad for you (and your ranking) if you get beaten by a pre-teen punk. But on the other hand, you feel dirty using your 100-dollar deck of cards and five years’ experience to destroy them on turn two.
But I was that kid once, so I feel a bit differently. I played my first Magic tournament in third grade, with a bow in my hair and a deck of cards I had scrounged together by saving up allowances and “borrowing” cards from my older brother. I used a Lisa Frank notepad to keep track of “life totals.” In hindsight, I’m sure I looked perfectly ridiculous to the shop’s clientele. With more luck than skill, however, I managed to score a third-place finish. (The 20 bucks of store credit I earned was equal to five allowances!)
But that shop was small-time. Everyone there knew my mom, who dropped me off there, and my older brother, who often hovered over my shoulder and gave me tips on “how to suck less.” I would hear the older guys mention bigger tournaments—pro-level games in Nashville or Louisville. I wanted to be serious like them; I wanted to play in those big games. So, when I had an opportunity to go to the Kentucky State Magic Tournament right after my 11th birthday, I jumped at the chance.
I went in a carpool with a couple other guys from the shop—one college student and one of my dad’s coworkers—and my mother, who, despite knowing next to nothing about that silly card game, was willing to drive the three of us from Bowling Green to Louisville and back.
During the car ride up, the guys gave me all their best advice: how to spot a cheater, how to call a judge if there is a disagreement about the rules, what kinds of decks were getting played on the tournament circuit. I did not want to admit I was nervous, but I was. I shuffled the same deck over and over. Once we got to the tournament itself, I was staggered by its enormity. The biggest tournament I had ever seen back home had 30 people. This one had at least 300, packed into the largest room in the largest convention center in the entire state.
When the tournament began, I was on my own—my mom had left to go shopping somewhere in Louisville, and my carpool buddies were at opposite ends of the convention center. I sat at table 74, waiting for my opponent, and when he arrived, neither of us talked much. Like poker players I had seen on TV, I tried to make my expression inscrutable as we laid cards on the table, turn after turn. A strategic blunder lost me my first game, but there were still two games left in the match. I won the next game, then he won again—a 1-2 match loss. Managing my best smile, I said, “Good game,” shook his hand, and sauntered off.
I should have been disappointed, and to some extent I was, but I was really more excited than anything else. I had played a whole game in my first pro-level Magic tournament, and I had not totally embarrassed myself. Anyway, I was just getting warmed up.
I won the next round, then lost—and went on to sit through all six rounds. By the end of the day, I was having too much fun to manage the poker face. Between rounds, I chatted with other competitors, discussing deck archetypes and casually rattling off my win-loss record.
I walked away from that tournament having lost more rounds than I won, but I still felt an immense swell of pride. I had been in the same room as a state champion. I had played the best of the best, and I had not cried or whined or embarrassed myself. I was just another Magic player.
So, when “the kid” wanders into the shop nowadays, I do my best to give her a fair game—smiling, as excited to play as she is. That is all I wanted back then, after all.

I had walked passed the street a million times and it looked just the same, save for a hardly noticeable sign trying to pass itself off as a lamp post: “Saloon.” Walk down two flights of stairs into a dimly lit basement and you will think you have entered the past, complete with handlebar moustaches and hermetic flasks.
Saloon, in Somerville, Mass., is one of many new bars and restaurants embracing the feel of the Prohibition and pre-Prohibition era. It is all part of the experience—today customers are seeking more than just tasty food or creative drinks; they are seeking a full interactive event. The décor, the menu, the restaurant staff, the customer—all contribute to a theatrical reenactment of the food culture of a distinct historical period. And what better way to build community than through this form of art, a staged dining experience based on customer participation?
Forget Islands, a kitschy family-oriented chain of eateries that aims to evoke a tropical atmosphere while serving burgers and fries and selling merchandise, or Rainforest Cafe—same idea, different biome. At Saloon, somehow the whole experience manages to avoid being so trite. The alcoholic punch for two is delicious and actually uses ingredients popular in the pre-Prohibition era (brandy, wine, yellow Chartreuse), as does the authentic cuisine, which includes bubble and squeak (assorted remnants of last night’s dinner, mushed together and grilled like a pancake) and fish and chips.
Interested in more ways to play a part? You need not look further than Saloon’s community celebrations. At the recent Valentine’s Day Sadie Hawkins Dinner & Dance, women asked men to accompany them to the event, as per tradition, with many dressed in appropriate period attire. Now, the movement to make the local community a more vital part of local food business expands beyond attempts at authentic and theatrical play.
Consider the quickly expanding fast food company, Clover Food Lab, in Harvard Square and Boston, Mass., where I work in food preparation and greeting. Customers are encouraged to attend quarterly all-team meetings to voice opinions, provide suggestions, and become informed about the newest features of this local eatery. Clover works to keep an open dialogue with the community through an often-updated blog and Twitter account. Just this week, my friend and I discussed and decided upon the advantages of each local coffee roaster with a manager there. Managers are not only open to fulfilling customer requests but also to taking customers’ ideas into consideration. Indeed, just as the dinner table functions in a domestic setting, a restaurant can become a place of local gathering and discussion. At Clover, you can even pick up a weekly supply of farm-fresh vegetables. One of Clover’s locations now functions as a Community Supported Agriculture pick-up so community members can enjoy seasonal, local produce from organic farms.
As such, the roles of the consumer and producer—and their associated hierarchy—becomes blurred. The play, the openness, the community emphasis of today’s modern restaurants and bars reminds us that everyone can be a cook, an innovator, a participant, or an actor rather than just a passive consumer.
This creed has expanded far beyond traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, whose function is tied to its location and setting. Take the recently established community share, Kitchensurfing.com. Say you want to host a large dinner party but your tiny New York apartment is too small, not to mention you hardly know how to cook. Kitchensurfing, like couchsurfing.org, provides an interface where people can find kitchens to rent and chefs to hire for just such an event.
More than that, you can be the one to offer your kitchen to rent as a host or to provide your skills as a cook. I was happy to find there is no experience necessary to participate and signed up right away. Maybe being a cheap vegan cook who specializes in Asian and South Asian cuisine may just be my most marketable skill. Anyone and everyone is encouraged to sign up and participate. As the website says, “Food eaten alone is not delicious.” And while I would venture to say that is not always the case, it is clear that breaking open traditional culinary roles and expanding the power and participation of the community are surely appetizing. We can all play a part in this shared theater of eating, cooking, and sharing.

It seems like everybody these days wants to watch scores of teenagers battle to the death. The success of Suzanne Collins’ 2008 novel “The Hunger Games” has spawned two more sequels, a forthcoming film adaptation, and even a recent parody, “The Hunger Pains,” published by a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. In the course of all this mania, a few fans have reminded us that Koushun Takami’s Japanese novel “Battle Royale”—the teenage-blood-fest genre’s actual progenitor—has been all but neglected in the United States, as has its controversial 2000 film adaptation directed by Kinji Fukasaku. The film, which began its Boston-area premier last week at the Brattle Street Theater, is in-your-face entertainment at its boldest, but it ultimately suffers from an inconsistency of tone.
Set in a not-so-distant-future totalitarian state, “Battle Royale” follows a group of students selected to participate in a three-day fight-to-the-death contest set up by the government to crack down on youth insubordination and delinquency. After being briefed by their scorned former teacher, the gleefully deadpan Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), the unlucky high schoolers are each given a weapon and launched into the forest of a deserted island to either kill each other off until one survivor remains, or die en masse via remote control explosion.
Perhaps its simple concept—”Lord of the Flies” meets “Survivor”—is the greatest strength of “Battle Royale.” Set at a Brechtian distance from the characters’ misery, the audience is invited to revel in the irony that this flock of unruly youth should be set against each other in a reality show with dead-serious stakes. The cathartic spectacle is enhanced by Kitano’s performance, a vivid  enactment of a teacher who has been ignored and disrespected one too many times. “Life is a game,” he pronounces matter-of-factly. “This country is no good anymore. So today’s lesson is you kill each other off.” As the doomed teenagers react to this news with panic and terror, we are not asked to sympathize but rather to laugh along with the maligned older generation.
The problem with this tone of alienation is that it is hard to maintain. The film, with its constant adolescent bloodletting, is certainly aware of its own wild envelope pushing; screen-violence guru Quentin Tarantino, perhaps unsurprisingly, endorsed it as “[the one movie] I wish I’d made.” Tarantino’s enthusiasm for “Battle Royale” is fitting given the film’s aspirations toward the outrageous, but he himself is ultimately the undisputed master of crafting a tone of alienation. When his characters accidently shoot each other in the face during casual conversation, we tend to laugh in spite of our shock and disgust because it is done in a way that illuminates the patent absurdity of everyday life, specifically in the bizarre and amoral world of modernity. “Battle Royale,” with scene upon scene of pleated-skirt-clad Japanese schoolgirls machine gunning each other to bits, wants to provoke this same kind of nihilistic effect but does not commit to it entirely. As a result, we get stuck with an emotional narrative following three specific contestants which, in the breaks between the shooting and stabbing, makes this feel like another schlocky teen movie. Sullied with a teenage romance-cum-revenge tragedy, the film confuses its own nihilistic thesis—as if “Pulp Fiction” had a subplot from “Twilight” inserted into the margins.
Like a voyeur, Fukasaku beckons us to watch as these dozens of teenagers accept, all too quickly, the every-man-for-himself mindset of the game, only to suspend the rule for the film’s protagonist, Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara), who somehow evades any of the Hobbesian debasement his companions suffer and instead maintains the moral posture of a Boy Scout.
Whatever sordid implications about human nature the film’s premise might have tried for are dashed against this paragon of the innately chivalrous main character, whose unfazed and level-headed goodness, even when thrust into a world of mad amorality, seems almost to belong in another movie. Shuya may try to shepherd the weak through the valley of darkness, but this film has established a world where only the tyranny of the evil makes any sense. At the end of the day, one can not help but wish that Tarantino had made this film, too.

Relationships on an island five miles long by two miles wide might get a bit incestuous. Indeed, the tied-up relationships between the four characters of Ella Hickson’s “Hot Mess,” showing at the Loeb Ex from March 1 to 3, deal with a smorgasbord of sex, death,  and love that borders on inappropriate sibling affection. With smooth execution, devoted acting, and highly interwoven technical specifics, “Hot Mess” transcends its misleadingly juvenile title to become a profound fashioning of universal issues.
Siamese twins Polo (Bryan D. Kauder ’14) and Twitch (Emily B. Hyman ’13) were separated at birth, and in dubious execution of his Hippocratic oath, the doctor bestowed Twitch with the one beating heart. Thus, Polo is incapable of loving and Twitch is incapable of keeping her love in check. When vacationer Billy (Ben J. Lorenz ’14) visits the island for the summer, Twitch invariably falls in love with him.
Both Kauder and Hyman excel at playing up their respective dearth and overflow of emotion. Hyman’s facial expressions oscillate wildly throughout the play, from donning a sort of psychotic smile when narrating her relationship with Billy to desperatly searching the face of her brother after he returns to the island from self-imposed exile. Kauder plays the reserved, cosmopolitan love interest with a subtlety that can only be appreciated by the end of the play. Commendable also is Lorenz’s air of amiable detachment as he becomes embroiled in the sibling’s strange circumstance as well as Twitch’s foil, Jacks (Darcy C. Donelan ’14), who uses sex to control her emotions instead of being overrun by them.
On the technical side, the light and sound mix well together—an especially nice touch is when lyrics of songs correlated with light schemes, such the use of bright yellow flood lights as Rihanna sings “yellow diamonds in the light” in her hit “We Found Love.” But when the technical elements are not so obviously clever, the mix of lighting coming from the glass- and-wood catwalk that runs through the Loeb Ex creates an ocean feel as blue lights illuminate the actors from above and below. Sound designer Caleb J. Thompson ’13, a Crimson arts writer, shuffles between more contemporary hits and some poignant classics—for example, when La Roux’s “In for the Kill” hits the lyric “Two hearts with accurate devotions / And what are feelings without emotions?”  Polo and Twitch stare at each other in an ironic reminder that the two of them share only one heart. Sometimes the tension combined with pop hits seemed a bit contrived; however, these are just questionable moments in an otherwise strong production.
The play’s strongest technical aspect is its stage design. One long catwalk serves as the stage and is raised above the audience on either side. In the beach scenes, it serves as the sand, and in the club scenes it serves as the dance floor, which allows for not only efficient scene changes but also interaction between the actors and the crowd. For example, Jacks takes a brief haitus from Polo and Twitch’s screwed-up fairly tale word to ellicit sexual attention from the audience.
Director Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts writer, deserves great credit for the smooth execution of what potentially could have been merely a mess. The combination of a script full of complex dialogue, an endless back-and-forth on the catwalk, the clever lighting, and the rich soundscape were executed without visible error, quite a feat for opening night. With such control over the main components of the play, McTaggart is able to add auxiliary elements—such as a bartender taking drink orders before the play began—in order to further entrench the light-hearted vibe. “Hot Mess” is, despite its name, not a mess at all. It is a well-organized production whose parts all coalese in a smart, funny take on love and sex

For a generation increasingly overloaded with 3D movies both new and reinvented from their 2D originals, it is not very surprising that legendary filmmaker George Lucas took the 3D plunge, a reflection on not only George Lucas but also our generation. Potentially alienating reactionary “Star Wars” fans, Lucas recently released a 3D version of “Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,” 13 years after the original hooked the millenials. The “Star Wars” saga has demonstrated an impressive ability to continue to engage obsessed fans over almost four decades. When this new film begins, and that yellow sans serif script flows into the distant reaches of space while familiar music marches along, the average fan gets his or her routine rush of exhiliration. However, the new 3D aspect does not add enough to merit a re-release on its own.
A brief explanation for those confused with the arc of the two “Star Wars” trilogies: “Phantom Menace” introduces 10-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a child with Jedi abilities who will eventually become Darth Vader. The film also establishes the relationship between Skywalker and his mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), as well as that between Skywalker and his paramour, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman). In this re-release, Keira Knightley serves as Amidala’s double, Sabe, and is listed incredibly low in the credits. Also introduced are droids C3P0 and R2d2, who will somehow survive all six episodes. Interestingly enough, this is the episode that propels the scheming Senator Palpatine into the role of Imperial Emperor. The movie does a fairly good job setting up the series and is packed with suspense, action, and chilling foreshadowing. Lucas heavily relies on fans’ prior knowledge of the series’ ending to produce an eerie feeling when Jedi master Yoda, refusing to train young Anakin, says, “Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.”
The movie presents a broken and corrupt Galactic Republic and a flawed soon-to-be-Darth-Vader that eventually lead to the rise of an evil empire. Replete with irony, the feel-good ending also sets the stage for the horror that will engulf all the characters as the saga unfolds. So that leads us to the widely panned comic relief character, Jar-Jar Binks. A gangly and annoying yet good-hearted Gungan, he added very little except for random non-sequiturs to the 2D movie, and his slimy tongue slightly stretching into my 3D glasses makes him even less endearing and ever so much more annoying. However, repeated exposure to Jar-Jar desensitizes his character, allowing for a better experience of the movie in general.
The new 3D movie has value as visual eye candy. Commanding three Oscar nominations for its original incarnation—Best Sound Effects, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Effects editing—one might expect to be blown away during a 3D rendering. The only problem was, after removing the 3D glasses during the movie, there was not a significant difference in picture quality or even the blurry screen usually associated with heavily-laden 3D effect.
“Star Wars” never required an intensely 3D movie—again, nobody wants to see Jar-Jar Binks’ tongue in 3D. The type of 3D production used in this film was stereoscopic 3D, in which the film appears in multiple layers to the audience to give a sense that one is looking into a diorama. Therefore, this technology is not the technology that causes objects to appear to literally jump out of the screen. Only four scenes fully used the 3D to maximum effect: the spaceship scene escaping the Planet Naboo, the podrace scene, the last space battle between the Naboo and the Trade Federation, and of course the lightsaber fight between Darth Maul (Ray Park), Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Here the 3D did have redeeming value. Those specific scenes were spectacular and added to the overall Star Wars experience. Actually feeling immersed in a podrace or participating in an epic lightsaber fight is incredibly exhilarating.
However, on the whole, the 3D effects are not enough to merit a revisit to the classic. The balance of the movie felt strangely familiar, and even the new computer-generated Yoda (instead of a puppet) was not surprising or novel in 3D. The real question at the end of “Phantom Menace,” however, is whether or not a subpar 3D experience can dissuade fans from returning. —Staff writer Alexander J.

“I was brought into this world to write this masterpiece, and it is written,” proclaims a stately old man dressed in a regal Grecian toga as he draws on the strength of ancient philosophers like Cicero when they addressed the Roman Senate. However, this exalting image sharply contrasts with the painful reality of his present situation. Jonathan Flynn (Robert De Niro) is actually clothed in a makeshift bed sheet. He is at a homeless shelter called Harbor’s Inn, ranting to an audience while he pisses on the floor. The scene is both humorous and pitiful, as the audience comes to grip with a washed-out, haggard man, sustained on his fanciful delusions of grandeur.
Adapted from “Another Bullshit Night in Suck City,” the true-to-life memoirs of author Nick Flynn, the movie depicts the life of the young author (Paul Dano) as he tries to find meaning in his existence and inspiration for his writing, while exploring the tenuous boundaries of his relationship with his estranged father Jonathan. Directed by Paul Weitz, “Being Flynn” is a meditation on defining yourself, and the fragile bonds of family.  While the movie suffers at times from a lack of narrative concision, it is ultimately redeemed by De Niro’s excellent portrayal of his character.
The film starts with the premise that both father and son have not spoken to each other for a long time. Yet, as both Nick and Jonathan narrate their lives separately, it becomes clear how similar their lives are and how intertwined they will become. Jonathan is deluded that he is a great writer, and his fantasies of fame and fortune do not translate into quality fiction on paper. Having gotten out of prison, he becomes a cab driver but soon loses his license and his apartment. Thus, he begins to stay in the homeless shelter where he encounters Nick, who works there.
De Niro, like the seasoned actor he is, evokes a multifaceted array of emotions that attests to skillful character building. “America has produced three classic writers,” Jonathan declares with gusto and certainty at the start: “Mark Twain, J. D. Salinger, and me.” Even when he has hit rock bottom, he refuses to acknowledge his failures. Instead, he tells Nick that the homeless shelter is a great place for him to gather material for his writing. His bravado both defines him as a survivor who can bear all of life’s beatings and hinders him from crawling out of his rut. With this fleshed-out script to work from, De Niro skillfully creates a complete picture of denial and cognitive dissonance that extracts both pity and sympathy. From the scene first mentioned exemplifying abandon to the lost looks that filter through when only the camera is watching, De Niro shines.
Nick Flynn, on the other hand, fits the stereotypes of a young starving writer who is in need of a job and some life experience to support his writing aspirations. However, as Dano grapples with the darkness within his character, his performance grows forced. More often than not, he is overshadowed by De Niro’s forceful personality. Every time he has a confrontation with De Niro, it seems like he drowns in De Niro’s stage presence and becomes unmemorable. Part of this might be due to the film’s cinematography and lighting. While De Niro putters comfortably in the grim daylight and shadows of the homeless shelter, Dano looks awkward and out-of-place.
As far as technical elements, the film meanders through days at the homeless shelter whose significance is not clear. The focus on the endless administrative tasks of the shelter—mainly picking up homeless people sleeping outside—dominates the middle section of the film to no special effect. Even though the first rendition of this scene might be interesting to watch, it is too dull to warrant multiple iterations. Combined with the almost whiny quality of both characters, the dialogue can become painful. The best scenes skip dialogue entirely and rely on De Niro’s capacity for monologue.
Despite the aforementioned weaknesses, “Being Flynn” deserves credit for dealing with some difficult issues such as father-son relationships, class, ambition, and substance abuse. De Niro proves to be its main star and shows that Dano could learn some new tricks from an old hand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Now what should I do with my life?” is a question that has crossed the minds of countless people, from second-semester college seniors to starving artists to successful executives. Last week in the intimate setting of the Adams House Pool Theater, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club put on “tick, tick...Boom!”—a self-deprecating and funny musical written by Jonathan Larson and directed by Allen J. Macleod ’14. Although the singing is sometimes lackluster, the show makes up for this with its actors’ passion and Macleod’s effective direction.
Larson is best known for writing the Pulitzer Prize-winning “RENT,” and “tick, tick...Boom!” explores many of the same themes. The musical tells the story of Jon (Adam J. Conner ’14), a struggling composer who begins to have doubts about his career as his 30th birthday approaches. As he goes about his life, he hears an incessant ticking sound in the distance that reminds him that the end of his youth is frighteningly close. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Susan (Kimberly A. Onah ’15) wants to move out of New York and start a family, and his best friend Michael (Karl Kopczynski ’15) has given up his own acting career in favor of a lucrative job at a marketing firm. The musical pays homage to the young struggling-artist lifestyle and to New York City while still critiquing the conditions of life in the 1990s. As Jon puts it, “It’s hard for people born after 1960 to be idealistic or original. We know what happens to ideals. They’re assassinated or corrupted or co-opted. It’s 1990 for God’s sake…. [It’s] conservative, complacent, obtuse, and unimaginative. Or, to put it another way: George Bush is president of the United States.”
Using just three actors to play all the parts in the show allows “tick, tick... Boom!” to burst with creative energy. Conner’s effective interpretation of Jon grounds the musical and gives it poignancy. His rendition is personable and realistic—a man who seems to be an adult but has not quite grown up, who gobbles Twinkies, and who holds down a dull job at a local diner while following his dream of becoming a major composer. The strongest parts of the musical are not its musical numbers but the scenes in which Conner, who is a Crimson business editor, speaks directly to the audience, sharing personal confessions that, because they seem genuine, generate empathy for a character who otherwise might seem unremarkable.
Though the Pool Theater space is limited in size, Macleod has his actors take full advantage of all the space available. For example, one song, which takes place in a diner, has the actors climbing on the furniture to mock over-demanding customers. Many of the songs are accentuated by the actors climbing up bleachers and using the aisle space to engage the crowd.
The musical would risk foundering if not for the passion that the actors bring to the stage. The small cast injects humor and zest into the aforementioned musical number through their characterization of the customers and wait staff. In another effective song, the cast parodies a typical couple’s fight as they sing “I feel bad that you feel bad about me feeling bad about you feeling bad about what I said about what you said about me not being able to share a feeling.” The cast also belts out an ode to sugar, and in another scene, to the luxuries of Michael’s new apartment, which has no more “noxious fumes from gas heaters that are illegal” or “climbing over sleeping people before you get out the door of your own building.” The actors seem very sure of their interpretation of Larson’s script, and this confidence allows them to effectively translate some of the show’s more abstract moments to the audience.  As a whole, the musical is witty, angsty, and self-aware. However, it is clear that the actors are having fun, and that makes it enjoyable to watch. Some of the songs are forgettable, the overall production is an engaging David-and-Goliath story that pits the striving artists on one side against corporate America and the behemoth of Broadway on the other. HRDC’s latest production delivers laughs and a compelling story while leaving viewers with the uncomfortable notion that they, too, might have a clock ticking down to the day when they reach 30.

It’s “lions and tigers and bears, oh my!”  at “Paper Zoo,” a new children’s exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts. The playful selection of photographs, drawings, and prints from artists like Rembrandt and Picasso includes a variety of creatures from the animal kingdom. The exhibit, which runs through August 19, also let children meet and sketch live animals at special events last week. The Roving Reporter met with some young artists who were perusing the exhibit.
 
Jeremy, 9
RR: Who was your favorite artist that you saw?
Jeremy: Pablo.
RR: Pablo…Picasso?
Jeremy: That’s what I just said. Pablo.
RR: What’s your favorite animal?
Jeremy: Snails, because they’re very enduring.
 
Kahleel, 9
RR: Why did you want to come to this exhibit?
Kahleel: I wanted to see animals and paintings. Maybe one of them could inspire me or something.
RR: If you had your own museum, what would you put in it?
Kahleel: Drawings, and I would put pictures of people from a long time ago, and maybe I would add detailed stuff like maybe draw a nice bird or a dog or a fish.
RR: If you were Picasso and you wanted to draw a squirrel, would you do it from memory or look at a real squirrel?
Kahleel: From a real squirrel, but people don’t really see squirrels that much. I’ve only seen them like twice.
RR: Really? They’re always in trees. I feel like they follow me.
Kahleel: I know, but I don’t live next to a forest or anything. There’s, like, five trees in my backyard. Usually I see squirrels there, and once I saw a squirrel fly to the other tree.
RR: A flying squirrel? I don’t believe you.
Kahleel: You should because I saw it, and my dad took a picture of it. He flew, and my dad showed me the picture. You kind of can’t see it because his camera was a phone one, but I saw it. So it happened.
 
Ryan, 7
RR: How do you think these artists knew what the animals looked like?
Ryan: I think they just think it up in their brains. I draw stuff in my brain.
RR: What kind of stuff?
Ryan: What dreams would look like.
RR: Do you like zoos?
Ryan: Yes. I like the apes. Have you seen the movie where the whole planet is filled with apes?
RR: “Planet of the Apes”?
Ryan: Yes!
Hannah, 8
RR: What was your favorite animal?
Hannah: Probably a rabbit, because they’re cute and small, and I like their tails. Especially because they’re puffy. And I have one. We have 13 pets.
RR: No, you don’t!
Hannah: Yes, we do! 
RR: What kind of pets?
Hannah: Nine fish, a chinchilla, a dove, a cat, and a rabbit.
RR: A chinchilla? Whose room is the chinchilla in?
Hannah: The basement, with the rabbit.
RR: How dangerous! What if he eats it?
Hannah: He won’t. He eats pellets.
RR: Would you want your art to be in a museum one day?
Hannah: Yeah. It would be awesome to see my own work on the wall, or maybe if someone drew me. It’s cool to see someone’s perspective of me.
RR: Do you ever draw self-portraits?
Hannah: Sometimes. In art class we did. We had mirrors.
RR: Maybe that will be on a museum wall one day.
Hannah: That would be awesome. Or on the fridge!
 
Claire and Maeve, identical twins, 7
RR: What’s your favorite animal that you saw today?
Claire: The slug!
RR: Ew, why?
Claire: They’re slimy. Slimy stuff is cool, like snails and wet clay and snot.
RR: What else do you like to draw?
Maeve: Myself from memory.
RR: That’s cheating!
Maeve: Why?
RR: Because you guys can just look at each other!
Maeve: Oh yeah. I never thought of that.
 
Dian Dian, 10
RR: What kinds of animals inspire you?
Dian Dian: Lions and snakes, because lions are brave and snakes are a symbol for wisdom.
RR: Do you go to museums a lot?
Dian Dian: Yeah, but I like zoos better.
RR: Would you buy a zoo?
Dian Dian: Nope, it’s a lot of work, and I already have a lot of things to do.
RR: What do you have to do?
Dian Dian: I have a lot of homework, and I do ballet. I already get up at 7.

I was born listening to Emmylou Harris—not literally, though I suspect my parents had her records playing by the time I came home from the hospital. I remember carving pumpkins when “Wrecking Ball” came out, listening to “Red Dirt Girl” with my baby sister, and trying to convince my parents that Emmylou was actually singing about my uncle Dever in “Deeper Well.” Her music was present the way my extensive caterpillar toy collection and two cats were: an aspect of my childhood that I never appreciated or contemplated but merely accepted as a fact of life.
I grew up. I gave my 15-member caterpillar family to a younger cousin. My old cats died, and new cats took their places. I cut my hair and grew it out again, only to dye it red a few years later. I bought baggy camouflage jeans to mimic Avril Lavigne and eventually traded them in for a distressed pair from Abercrombie. An iPod replaced my Walkman, running replaced gymnastics, I had a negligible growth spurt, and I kept my nose to the grindstone. I went to college. And along the way, I lost Emmylou.
But everything changed last summer when I finally got my driver’s license. With a spare old car in the garage, the world was mine. I was a city girl seeing the world from behind the wheel for the first time. Somehow, on one of my first steps towards being a “real” adult, I rediscovered my childhood—long car rides are nothing without good music. I started looking through my dad’s massive CD collection for new tunes to carry me through daily jaunts and weekend trips, and, along the way, I alighted on the old Emmylou CDs.
There is something so amazingly surreal in seeing, hearing, or otherwise sensing an element from the past entering the present. These CDs were my childhood, even though I barely remembered those years. Yet this music ran deeper than memory—it was a feeling, and that was even more affecting. I tuned in, and this time I didn’t tune out. I really listened. And I liked what I heard.
My ears recalled what my visual memory could not, and through her songs, I began to reconstruct fragmented feelings from my childhood. The quality of her voice—aching, lonely, and breathy yet strong—was captivating and undeniably beautiful. She sang about heartbreak and death, childhood and dreams.
Experiencing this music for the first time in more than a decade conjured up an incredibly bizarre sense of déjà entendu. Hearing these songs as an adult felt rather like hearing them as a new person. Yet around every refrain, percussive beat, and soaring octave, I could see three year-old me dancing and singing along.
The songs were truer than I ever remembered. Two especially—“Red Dirt Girl” and “All My Tears”—stuck out for their melancholy and honesty. “Waiting for the Alabama sun to go down / Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town, me and Lillian,” Emmylou recalls about her childhood best friend. Lillian married young and got stuck in the very life she had always dreamed of escaping—and ultimately took her own life. “But one thing they don’t tell you about the blues when you got ‘em,” Emmylou sings, “You keep on falling ’cause there ain’t no bottom, there ain’t no end / At least not for Lillian.” It’s a song of dreams lost and the sheer depression of reality. I could nearly see the red dirt of an Alabama driveway and the hunched silhouette of a beanstalk-thin woman. I could feel the depression that Emmylou could only release through song.
My other great rediscovery was “All My Tears.” It wasn’t until my fifth or sixth enthusiastic listen that I realized I was singing the praises of Jesus at the top of my lungs while driving past my synagogue. Oops. “It don’t matter where you bury me / I’ll be home and I’ll be free,” she sings. “It don’t matter where I lay / All my tears be washed away.” This song—rhythmic, entrancing, and tender—reminded me that, in an age of constant and novel consumption, it often pays to revisit what once worked long ago. These songs have no Auto-Tune, music videos, mash-ups, or collaborators: they are simple and true and just as profound now as 20 years ago.
Slowly but surely, an ever-expanding collection of Americana music worked its way onto my playlists. Lucinda Williams, Crooked Still, Alison Krauss, and Gillian Welch rested comfortably next to my Beatles, Björk, and Kanye. “Since when have you listened to country?” all my friends wondered. “Since forever,” I realized—and forever more.

Last Wednesday, jazz musicians Chase E. Morrin ’15 and Kevin Sun ’14, a Crimson magazine editor, presented their take on the music of Thelonious Monk in the Winthrop Junior Common Room. Morrin, on piano, and Sun, on tenor sax—both of whom are part of the Harvard/New England Conservatory of Music Joint Program—put together the concert as a first step in a broader plan to bring Harvard and NEC musicians together. Emphasising a democratic and spontaneous playing style, the pair aimed to approach Monk classics like “Straight, No Chaser” and “’Round Midnight” with a fresh angle.
 
 The Harvard Crimson: It’s clear from hearing you guys play that you aren’t just jamming on top of a couple of Monk tunes—you seem to have really come up with a new arrangement for most of these. What was your approach to coming up with new arrangements?
 
Kevin Sun: It’s funny that you say that we really clearly have arrangements. I think it might come off that way, but a lot of the time—especially for this particular concert, because we didn’t have that much time to rehearse—we’re sort of forced to come up with arrangements on the spot. I think creatively we agree on a few key points.
 
Chase E. Morrin: Yeah, we did a little bit of, just like—“Oh, ‘’Round Midnight,’ we’re going to do it à la Impressionistic.” That was pretty much it.
 
KS: And then from there, I think within that, there’s enough of a focus that the piece isn’t going to go all over the place. It won’t be discontinuous.
 
CEM: With two players, you can really do a lot. You don’t have to stick to a form, you don’t have to arrange things as you normally do for a group—you can let things happen. And since there are only two players, you’re connected. You can really make things happen on the spot.
 
KS: There’s an unbelievable amount of freedom, especially playing with Chase. Chase has huge ears. He will hear anything that someone else plays and then adapt to that. So it’s fun playing with Chase, because when we play one of these [tunes] that have been played who knows how many times, we can do something different every time. We can just change time signatures on a dime. We can change keys if we want—we can change almost anything, as long as we agree on it mutually, which we can because we’re only two people. With four people, making those mutual agreements is more clunky.
 
THC: So why did you choose Monk?
KS: Originally, the idea for having a concert in the first place [was that] we just wanted to play a duo concert, and we hadn’t decided what kind of music to play. This came out of the desire to have Harvard/NEC musicians come together more as a community, even though there are only a few of us. I’ve been talking to a professor in the Harvard Music Department, Ingrid Monson, about trying to get something off the ground in the future—sort of like an ensemble between Harvard and NEC with players from Harvard and teachers from NEC. I also had support from the Jazz Department head at NEC, Ken Schaphorst, and also the director of the jazz band here, Tom Everett.... When it came to deciding what kind of music, I think we arbitrarily chose Monk just because we both like playing Monk’s music.
CEM: Monk has such a distinct personality, that, you know, if you do a tribute to just a random person—Miles Davis, John Coltrane—I mean, they’re great people, that’s cool, but what you’re doing is pretty much saying, “Oh, here’s the standard bebop vocabulary.” Whereas Monk is really like—if you’re going to do a concert tribute to him, you’ve got to really get into him, which we’ve done to a degree.... I think with playing Monk in general, first of all...he pretty much defies the standard jazz [and] bebop vocabulary that he was part of...and so when you play his music, you always want to do something different.... If you do the same thing, there’s no point, because Monk did it better than anyone else could. But [we are] also trying to stay true to what he wanted to accomplish, the vibe that he creates with his pieces.... Trying to balance those two things is hard, but we thought it was a cool challenge to try.
THC: Anything else you guys would like to add?
KS: There will be another concert sometime in March. It might not be duo; we might get a bass player. This is just the first one.

Richard L. Rundell boarded a shuttle with about 100 others at the Harvard innovation lab. They had just played a memory game involving early 20th century product brands, and they are headed to what is called the “thought incubator” at Continuum, a consulting agency.
The iLab and Continuum were two stops on “Experience Economies 6: Innovate or Die,” a tour on Feb. 18 created by cultural event organizer Experience Economies and hosted and presented by The Lab at Harvard. Innovate or Die led Rundell and the other attendees around Boston area hubs of innovation and highlighted unique projects from artists and scientists. Rundell explains why he traveled from California to participate. “Everyone wants to be innovative,” he says. “It is a small part of business relative to actually getting things done.”
But innovation is a buzzword with little concrete meaning, say MIT architecture doctoral candidate Rebecca K. Uchill and Graduate School of Design student Gavin M. H. Kroeber. The pair co-founded the Experience Economies tour two years ago. “In its original conception, Experience Economies was a kind of social venue with a work-in-progress platform at the center of it—a couple steps beyond potluck plus artwork,” Kroeber says. Each stop on the Innovate or Die tour was meant to examine or critique the concept of innovation from a different angle.
The plan for the night involved shuttling ticketholders to various locations around Boston. The buses left from The Lab, and after attendees worked with doctoral candidate in the history of science Jeremy Blatter at the iLab, two artists presented new angles on innovation at Continuum.
In Catherine McMahon’s audience-participation performance piece, two conference rooms were transformed into a studio set where attendees filled in the blanks, Mad-Libs-style, to a script for what sounded like a public service announcement. In another room, Kelly Sherman, artist and strategist at Continuum, showed posters detailing her collaboration with art teacher Aziza Robinson-Goodnight and the Design Studio for Social Intervention, a Boston social service group. Their project, Sherman explained, aimed to confront violence in the school system by creating a performance piece incorporating students’ definitions of a “fight” and its causes. 
At Continuum, Ned L. Whitman ’15—an undergraduate student helping staff a tour comprising mostly graduate-level artists and businesspeople—was bartending. A painter as well as neurobiology buff, he said events like Innovate Or Die should be held on an expanded scale. “An event like this should be done for undergraduates—not only for Harvard, but [for] the Boston community,” he said. 
On the way to the Idea Translation Lab @ Cloud Place, attendees were told they were about to take a test. Rations of bananas, for potassium, and AeroShots, for caffeine, were distributed on the bus. 
The exam’s creator, artist Mary Walling Blackburn, called the test—the Anhoek Required Examination—a sort of pedagogical experiment. Participants were required to write short essays justifying a range of bizarre topics, from the sexist nature of Mohawk Indians’ term “pretty little canoe” for vagina to the irony of for-inmates-by-inmates clothing lines. The test was designed, Blackburn explained, to force takers into connecting ideas they never would have otherwise and into making absurd arguments sound legitimate. “I wanted to pervert the GRE. Being an artist, it’s my job to create new relationships,” she said. 
The night concluded with an after-party held in the Industry Lab, which houses start-up design companies, scientists, and artists alike in a space where interdisciplinary collaboration is encouraged. Past the bullpen and conference room in the front, attendees gathered for pizza in a large brick-walled loft in the rear of the space. Here, artists Jordan W. Long and Emily Hurley presented their work in video and mixed media art, respectively.
Long showed video of his pieces—performance art dealing with physical trauma—which he said represent a personal quest for innovation. “For me, I never really enjoyed performance art, ever. It was the last thing I liked when I looked at art…. When I started thinking about doing performance, I told myself, ‘I really want to change this game. I want to really take this a step forward,’” he says.
Hurley’s works take a nod from how the toy industry and internet tend to endlessly reappropriate old cultural works. As an example, she mentioned the latest Smurfs film. Her prints combine the body parts of different classic cartoon characters or otherwise alter their images—Cinderella’s makeup is smeared; the eyes of Droopy the dog are superimposed on the face of a young girl. 
In the loft, individuals with backgrounds in everything from product design to songwriting whispered excitedly about Hurley’s prints. Later, Hurley mentions the event’s spirit of uninhibited connection as her rationale for participating. “I don’t want to just talk to a bunch of artists,” she said. “You should be able to talk to everyone.”

CORRECTION: Feb. 29
An earlier version of this article stated that Richard L. Rundell is a software engineer from California. In fact, he is a senior director for a software company and lives in Massachusetts. In addition, the article quoted Rundell on the topic of innovation as having said, “A relatively small part of business is getting things done.” In fact, Rundell said, “It [innovation] is a small part of business relative to actually getting things done.”
CORRECTION: March 2
An earlier version of this article described Continuum as a startup consulting agency. In fact, the company was founded in 1983.

Did you know that a god-like coyote created methamphetamines? According to author Hari Kunzru’s novel “Gods Without Men,” at least, he did. The Coyote God of mischief and schadenfreude mixes up chemicals, blows his face off—don’t worry, he is resurrected three times by various animal friends—and is left with 100 grams of pure crystal whose use explains the delightfully psychotic nature of Kunzru’s latest work. The novel grapples with different portrayals of gods in the lives of characters as diverse as a mystically “cured” autistic boy, a jealous man with a Sikh background, and a desperate woman with a Jewish heritage. Through devotion to careful diction and seamless fluctuation between a dozen different writing voices, Kunzru’s novel shines as brightly as the setting’s desert sun.
The action follows Jaz and Lisa Matharu, two well-educated professionals who are vacationing in the Mojave Desert with their severely autistic four-year-old son Raj. Kunzru beautifully captures the anguish of a mother who is determined to cure her son: “Soon she’d abandoned her old reading altogether, the literary novels with bleak endings, the books about environmentalism or human rights. Those things felt like luxuries now, baubles for people who had no battles of their own.” Kunzru’s description of this frustration against a condition that both tears apart families and also invites endless public scorn proves incredibly realistic. One poignant portrayal of this derision is the Matharu family’s forced exodus from a series of hotels due to Raj’s loud tantrums. When Raj wanders off into the desert and returns with the capacity to learn, Lisa’s rediscovery of her Jewish roots comes as a highly satisfying moment—her prayers have been answered, and the reader has born witness to the emotional turmoil behind her decision.
Kunzru also focuses on an eclectic list of supporting characters who all have their own ties to spirituality and gods. Early in the story, Kunzru introduces a cult leader named The Guide who allegedly makes contact with aliens by digging a bunker in the middle of the Mojave and painting “Welcome” on the roof. Deluded by guilt from his experience fighting in World War II and the advent of nuclear weapons, The Guide preaches a message of world peace to followers who engage in bizarre, chanting cult rituals. The switch in narrative voice to this character’s calm demeanor serves as excellent juxtaposition to the Matharus, whose prayers for a miracle are so interrupted with real-life stress that they could never hope to achieve the The Guide’s calm fatalist perspective.
The most compelling voice, however, is not the relatively mainstream Matharus or wacky The Guide, but rather that of disillusioned rock musician Nicky. He runs away to the desert with peyote and a gold-plated gun to escape from Los Angeles squalor. Every character in the novel interacts mystically with the desert, but Kunzru’s portrayal of an artist who can hardly string together everyday thoughts yet exhibits unexpected compassion is especially admirable. More than anyone else, Nicky truly understands Raj. Like all the other characters, he also has a pseudo-religious experience in the desert—”The cacti raised their arms up to heaven. He wondered about joining them, praying for forgiveness. He felt sick. Would [his girlfriend] forgive him? What about all the others? He got down on his knees. Sorry, he whispered. I didn’t mean anything by it.”
Thus, Kunzru’s descriptions of religion run an impressive gamut from the commonplace to the unexpected. He describes parents praying for a cure for their child and using religion as a barrier against strangers, a rock musician using substances and women to distract himself from suicide, a guilty soldier atoning through religion, and the impious Coyote—who serves as the only representation of a real god in the novel. Five more perspectives supplement the novel with further ideas about the interactions between religion, spirituality, and this desert.
However, instead of falling into an established pattern of magical realism, the strongest parts of the novel are the moments rooted in human nature; indeed, a more fitting title might have been “Men Without Gods.” For all of the divine encounters in the Mojave Desert, it is the personal travails of each of the characters that make for compelling reading. Jaz and Lisa’s struggle against the media attack following their son’s disappearance is more powerful than Raj’s transformation in the last quarter of the book; likewise, the ability of The Guide to gain such a cult following based on a ridiculous premise is more intriguing than his original alien encounters. The supernatural ultimately retreats before the endless fascinating aspects of human suffering and triumph.
“Gods Without Men” is carefully written, constructed, and packaged; the prose is beautiful, every character is fully developed, and the desert itself will prove memorable even as the sands of time blow grittily across the novel’s pages.

“If an old man and woman conjured a little girl out of the snow and wilderness, what would she be to them? A daughter? A ghost?” writes Eowyn Ivey in her haunting and mesmerizing debut, “The Snow Child.” The year is 1920, and pioneers Jack and Mabel have recently abandoned their lives “back East” to start over in Alaska. This is no fairy tale: Their new home is as desolate and unforgiving as it is beautiful, and the haunted couple sinks into depression and desperation as they struggle to eke out a life in the unyielding wilderness. The appearance of a young girl in the woods evokes a flurry of emotion and questions in the couple, and one thing is certain—the child Faina, whether imagined, created, or entirely natural, will alter their lives forever. Ivey is not only a creative writer but also an emotive one, and “The Snow Child” triumphs through the sheer force of her prose. She is as adept at expressing boundless happiness as crushing sorrow. Setting this interplay of emotions against a majestic and rugged landscape proves a masterful stroke, and “The Snow Child” emerges as a work both profoundly moving and subtly mysterious.
Ivey proves her sensitivity as a writer in describing Mabel’s consuming depression at the novel’s outset. Mabel desperately wants to be a mother, but her only child died as a newborn; she has long since given up hope of ever raising a child of her own. More than that, the disappointment and constant struggles of life in Alaska have beaten her down to a state of complete hopelessness. The powerful opening chapter of Ivey’s novel finds her contemplating suicide. “[Alaska] was beautiful, Mabel knew, but it was a beauty that ripped you open and scoured you clean so that you were left helpless and exposed, if you lived at all,” Ivey writes, as she displays her finesse at creating jarring descriptions with beautiful writing. Later, “Mabel organized her hours into patterns—wash, mend, cook, wash, mend, cook—and tried not to imagine floating beneath the ice like a yellow leaf.” The Alaskan wilderness, in all its harsh beauty, feels close enough to touch; Ivey’s language sets the stage for the deep and pseudo-magical contact with the natural world that will occur when Faina arrives.
Jack and Mabel eventually receive reprieve from their pain in the form of this very mysterious child. Ivey’s story is essentially a re-telling of the Russian folktale “The Snow Maiden”—a story that, in fact, Mabel is all too aware of. One of her favorite childhood books,  it tells the story of a childless couple who build a daughter out of snow. They love and cherish her, but she eventually dies—in various versions from either exposure to warm weather or fire. Jack and Mabel have an eerily parallel experience: After they build a small snow child during a blizzard, they are surprised to find a young girl darting through the woods the next day. Did they create her? Did they imagine her? Has she been there all along? Their neighbors have no memory of the supposed blizzard that occurred the night she was “born;” Faina smells of snow and pine, can’t stand to be around fires, and communicates with woodland creatures; her voice is a gentle sigh that Ivey conveys without quotation marks. Yet as the novel progresses, signs of her unmistakable humanity crop up. Thus a novel that begins as a stunning exercise in magical realism slowly morphs into a tale quite grounded in reality, and it is up to the reader to determine how real—or how imaginary—various elements of the story truly are.
Ivey’s dalliance with the supernatural could have proved fatal to her writing, but by choosing to ground the story in provocative yet straightforward prose and in the subtle nuances of emotion, she avoids the pitfall of becoming too abstruse in topic or language. Faina is nearly a woodland creature herself—more sprite than child—yet as she ages, her attachment to her adoptive parents tethers her to the real world. “She seemed to him both powerful and delicate,” Jack reflects, “like a wild thing that thrives in its place but withers when stolen away.”
The vivid descriptions in Ivey’s writing thus allow great suspension of disbelief—an invaluable asset to a story that blends elements of imagination and reality so frequently. “To believe, perhaps you had to cease looking for explanations and instead hold the little thing in your hands as long as you were able before it slipped like water between your fingers,” Mabel thinks, as she hopes that Faina will return to them with the first frost after her summer disappearance. Yet her hope is also an apt description of the novel itself, for the entire world of “The Snow Child” unfolds like a dream. Besides Faina’s mysterious origin and behavior, the harsh wilderness itself is an element so removed from ordinary life that it functions on a grander scale than an average setting. To fully appreciate the effect of the story requires a level of removal from expectations and preconceptions. In this beautiful, often hopeless, and moving dreamscape, it is the emotions of the characters, not the plot itself, that result in a powerful novel.
Ultimately, the question of who, or what, Faina is becomes an exercise in pointless possibilities. She is both rationally imaginary and undeniably real; Ivey proves quite adept at stretching these bounds of storytelling and seamlessly weaves together a tale of love, family, and the inescapable cruelty of life to create a touching and melancholy story. Mabel’s sister perhaps sums it up best: “I see that life itself is often more fantastic and terrible than the stories we believed as children,” she writes in a letter, “and that perhaps there is no harm in finding magic among the trees.” There is no harm indeed, Ivey proves, in this enchanted and gripping debut.

Hit debut singles, as  promising as they may be, are often misleading. A band’s innovation and artistry can rarely be captured in a single song, especially when that song is designed to appeal to a wide audience. R.E.M.’s “Radio Free Europe,” for instance, is a defining piece of American post-punk, but it only hints at the nervy beauty of the band’s first album, “Murmur,” and the stunning breadth and creativity that make up the rest of R.E.M.’s catalogue.
There are also times, of course, when a band’s first single makes it out to be more interesting than it actually is—if Art Brut’s first single “Formed A Band” suggested a postmodern version of the Strokes, the debut album “Bang Bang Rock & Roll” revealed the band to be much less satisfying. Philly duo Chiddy Bang’s breakthrough single, 2010’s MGMT-sampling “Opposite of Adults,” suggested a hip-pop group with a penchant for electro-tinged indie rock. However, as their debut album “Breakfast” shows, band members DJ Xaphoon Jones and rapper Chidera “Chiddy” Anamege just look for hooks with no regard to any particular style. Indeed, Chiddy Bang seems content to reiterate its hip-pop formula of generic rhymes over cookie-cutter beats. “Breakfast,” although occasionally catchy, is a purely disposable product, and its weak and repetitive songs fail to leave a lasting impression.
The album’s repetitive nature permeates several aspects of its production and is key to the record’s failure. Nearly every song—from opener “Breakfast” to the closing “4th Quarter”—features the same midtempo beat, making the record feel like a generic workout mix. The songs blend together to the point that the second half’s brief and seemingly random string interlude feels more like a respite than an annoyance. Similar tempos aren’t the only problem; more troubling is the fact that several of the songs have nearly identical structures. “Mind Your Manners,” “Happening,” “Out 2 Space,” and “Run It Back” all open with a chorus instead of a verse, making it seem as if Jones couldn’t be bothered to devise more than one hook per song. Indeed, with their ruthless deployment of mindless hooks, the songs on “Breakfast” may be the first hip-hop tracks to be influenced by Jock Jams.
This explicitly hook-focused structure would not be a problem if the songs were always catchy. When the album hits its stride, its bright effervescence overwhelms its flaws. This is bubblegum rap music, and the best tracks pleasantly evoke the guilty pleasures of that genre. “Handclaps & Guitars” is as uncomplicated and energizing as its minimal title suggests. Even better is the single “Mind Your Manners,” which, in sampling “Manners” by the Swedish group Icona Pop, turns a clunky schoolgirl chant into an unstoppable earworm.
Both of these songs, however, occur near the beginning of the album, making it uncomfortably front-loaded. “Handclaps and Guitars” and “Mind Your Manners” may be invigorating on their own, but their formula is not quite enough to sustain an entire album. Nowhere is this fact clearer than during the song “Happening,” which features a chant similar to the one heard in “Mind Your Manners.” However, instead of recalling that song’s charm, “Happening” comes across as nothing more than a shoddy imitation.
What makes Chiddy Bang’s monotonous sound most problematic is its distinct sense of laziness. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with beating a certain style into the ground, so long as one masters that style; the Ramones, for instance, never strayed from a three-chord formula, but the band perfected it with verve and enthusiasm. Chiddy Bang, by contrast, does not quite have the energy or wit to be considered masters of hip-pop, which makes its desperate recapitulations of a tired formula seem more lethargic than inspired.
Indeed, Chiddy Bang’s status as latecomers to the frat rap party—“Opposite of Adults” came out more than a year after Asher Roth’s debut single “I Love College”—adds greed to their laziness. Chiddy Bang’s utter lack of enthusiasm and invention on “Breakfast” implies the duo is capitalizing on a trend rather than expanding a genre. It is difficult to say whether frat rap is bad for hip-hop, but ultra-commercialized copies certainly are, especially when those copies are as uninspired as this album.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is Tuesday morning, and I have just gotten off a shuttle from the Arthur M. Sackler Museum and arrived in Somerville, Mass. I am in front of an empty-looking office building next to a vacant lot. Disoriented, I enter through double doors and I am told by a security guard to go to the second floor. I take the elevator up and I find the floor completely empty. No offices, no signs, no people. After doing several confused loops around the space, I tentatively knock at a locked side door until another guard sees me and lets me inside.
Despite the odd surroundings, the room I have just entered is home to advanced and prestigious work. I have arrived at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, an art conservation center for the Harvard Art Museums that repairs an immense spectrum of artwork, from antiques to contemporary paintings and installation pieces. Originally located in the Fogg Museum on the Harvard campus, the Straus Center has moved to a temporary location in Somerville while the museum undergoes renovation and will remain there for the next few years. As Henry Lie, the director and senior conservator of objects and sculpture at the Center, gives me a tour of the space, I am amazed to see the wide array of scientific equipment that the Straus Center holds. From microscopes to laser cleaners to infrared spectrometers, this expensive technical equipment is disconnected from stereotypical art creation.
But science actually plays a central role in the world of art conservation. The interplay between studio art, science, and art history is the foundation of this often untold and unseen side of the art world. Even though audiences are able to see these works due to the conservation, the process responsible for each well presented painting in a museum is as invisible as the secluded Straus Center itself. Working behind the scenes, conservators engage heavily in the aesthetic and scientific components of both preservation and restoration. They are responsible for an integral part of the life cycle of a work of art and preserving the artistic vision of these works for history.
COVERT AFFAIRS
The Straus Center was the first institution in the United States to use scientific methods to study artists’ materials and techniques, with the collaboration of Edward Forbes, the first director of the Harvard museums, and Rutherford Gettens, a chemist, in 1928, and others. The technical research and preservation work conducted at the Straus Center were disseminated into the teaching of art history at Harvard, influencing generations of art historians and museum professionals.
Modern conservation uses cutting-edge technology to examine works or break down compounds in artistic materials. “UV fluorescence microscopy and polarized light microscopy are used a lot,” says Lie. “Looking in UV often shows the paint layers much better so that you can better get an idea of how the artist worked and what materials are present.”
The use of technology, however, is only one facet of the conservation process. Research, particularly into the artists behind the works, is important in determining what kind of conservation is appropriate. Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, the director of the Center for the Technical Study of Modern Art at Harvard Art Museums, is also the founder of the Artists Documentation Program, which is a partnership between the Menil Collection in Houston, Harvard Art Museums, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. The Artists Documentation Program makes it its job to interview contemporary artists about their work in order to reach a better understanding of how the artists wish for their art to be conserved. “It’s really important to ask these questions to artists while they are alive for the future generation of conservators,” Mancusi-Ungaro says. Through these interviews and film and photograph documentation, the Artists Documentation Project strives to honor the artists’ intent for the future preservation of works of art.
Preserving the aesthetics of a work is not only a matter of figuring out an artist’s technique and materials but also, depending on the age of the work, a matter of history. Mei-An Tsu, an object conservator at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, is currently working on restoring two Etruscan sarcophagi on display at the museum. Because the sarcophagi are too fragile to be moved, the conservation work is done on site and is available for public view. “I conduct a scientific investigation to look into how [the sarcophagi] were originally manufactured, and what they would have originally looked like,” Tsu says. “They would have been very ornately painted, and so a big question that art historians pose to us is, ‘What did these once look like? What did Etruscans use for paint? What types of stones were used?’” This interplay between art history, science, and technical skills in conservation is what makes the work so multifaceted and at the same time so hidden away—much of the procedure and instruments used requires very specific conditions that are most often found in labs. Though the works conservators preserve are displayed, the nature of their practice requires seclusion.
JACK OF ALL TRADES
Working with a plethora of laboratory equipment in an array of disciplines to produce something intended to go unnoticed takes years of practice and training. Who exactly are the people willing to put in such effort? Penley Knipe, the head of the paper conservation lab at the Straus Center, became a conservator because of her interest in the material world. “I was an anthropology and archeology major in college, and so I was always drawn to objects,” she says. Initially working in the Harvard Art Museums drawing department, she developed an interest in conservation. “I’ve always loved looking at things really intensely and trying to see how they were made, and so I just changed my course because I really wanted to spend time with the material objects.”
Anne Driesse, another conservator in the paper conservation department at the Straus Center, came from an academic background perfect for conservation. “At college I majored in art history and [got] a minor in chemistry with a third concentration in studio art,” she says. “I wanted to be able to somehow combine all of those facets, and I started working with a painting conservator and a paper conservator at the Cooper Hewitt Museum [in New York, NY]. I was drawn to watercolor and drawing—I had a natural affinity for paper conservation.” Both Knipe and Driesse, like all other conservators, had to go through years of study and fellowships in order to secure their positions. The conservators not only possess highly specialized skill sets but a combination of technical and aesthetic abilities that is unique to their profession.
The technical skills required for art conservation can overlap with those found in chemistry and microbiology. For example, Archana Vasanthakumar, a post-doctorate fellow in the Laboratory of Applied Microbiology at Harvard, works in conservation science. “One of the big focuses of the lab over the last 10 years or so has been cultural heritage microbiology,” Vasanthakumar says. “By this I mean the microbiology of anything that is historically or culturally significant, from manuscripts to old books to monuments to paintings.” Technical expertise allows art conservators to be highly exacting in their work; this degree of care is highly necessary. In examining these cultural objects from a scientific standpoint as well as an artistic one, it is a requirement for conservators to be extremely detail-oriented in their work. If they are not careful in their analysis of material, they could jeopardize the preservation of important historical findings.
Thus, for a conservator, even the act of cleaning dirt from a statue is fraught with risk. The wrong use of equipment, a chemical cleaner, or a rough hand could all affect the outcome of the finished product. “You have to be able to technically do the cleaning with sensitivity, and that’s where the artistic skills come into play,” Tsu says. “You have to have a really good eye and dexterity.” Although to the common museum visitor the pristine state of the pieces in a collection is a given, in reality there is an entire faction of conservators working behind the scenes to restore the art.
CROSSING THE LINE
Whether the flaws are as obvious as cracks in an ancient statue or as subtle as the fading of ink on old parchment, when an object needs restoration, it is brought back to the lab. Tests are done so that the most information possible is procured about the piece, but this is simple compared to the balancing task at hand; conservators must weigh making needed repairs against upholding the artistic integrity of the work.
They are thus posed a question: What is the fine line between conservation and alteration? “It’s a question we deal with all the time, and one that you are taught things about when you go to formal graduate programs,” Lie says. “All the different areas of art, from Neolithic archeological material through contemporary material, tend to have different ways of approaching that question.”
Some works, like porcelains and paintings, need to look perfect, so those repairs are done in a way that is different from historical archeological materials, where restoration is more heavily needed. Restoration should never be obvious, though. Driesse says, “The approach to conservation is always the same: Less is more.”
The line between conservation and alteration is extremely important when considering the preservation of the artist’s objective in the work of art. To conservators like Mancusi-Ungaro, anything done to a work of art alters it, so one must be very cautious to not change the effect of the artwork. “You don’t do anything that would interfere with what was intended, which is the immaterial effect, but you are also respectful of the material effect. That’s really the central directive of what I do and what [all] conservators do—it’s conserving a work without altering it in a way that counters the artist’s intent.” These conservators’ painstaking research and the millions of dollars invested in scientific and technical equipment are all in the hopes of preserving the artistic vision for current and future generations.
AN UNLIKELY MARRIAGE
In addition to preserving artistic vision, conservation can in fact play a role in inspiring it. David Maisel, a contemporary artist based in California, creates photographs of the x-rays of three-dimensional art objects that are usually found in conservation labs. He was inspired by his residency at the Getty Research Institute. “One if the things I was thinking about was the way that changing technology would allow us to see into realms that we would not otherwise see,” Maisel says. “I was basically spending time in the painting conservation lab at the Getty, and one day they had this incredible x-ray taped up to the window, and it looked like this abstract expressionist painting by Franz Kline or something, but in fact it was this x-ray of this 19th century landscape painting they were working on, and the disjunction between the two things was really captivating.”
Maisel’s work not only transforms a method of preserving art into art itself but also captures the interplay of art and science that is present in conservation. Moreover, advances in the technological landscape have directly affected conservation, which is apparent in the x-rays and other products used in the discipline. “Conservation is a marriage of science and studio hand skills and art history,” Knipe says.
It is the hope of conservators that the field becomes more visible to the public eye. Although many of the objects in conservation are, for practical reasons, kept in laboratories and behind closed doors, the efforts of conservators is overwhelmingly out of view. Even those in the field, such as Vasanthakumar, were not aware of conservation until they entered it. Despite this initial lack of knowledge, she believes that publicity on conservation is gaining more momentum. “Conservation science is becoming more visible in diverse forums such as conferences,” Vasanthakumar says.
Museums like Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts are also making more of an effort to showcase their conservation efforts. “Most people don’t even know that we have a whole science lab upstairs, [though] it is a very important part of the preservation of art and getting [art] on view,” says Tsu. “The public doesn’t really know, and they’re always really fascinated to find out.” Conservation labs are a gold mine for art historians, scientists, and curators as well as members of the general public who are interested in how works survive to make it on display.
As I toured around the Straus Center, I could clearly see the dialogue between art and science that is crucial to conservation. The discipline allows practitioners to hone their technical skills, but the field itself is much more holistic. Conservation places weight not only on the material makeup of artwork but also the art’s history and original intent.
Examining rows of multicolored pigments collected by Forbes, the Straus Center’s first director, in the ’20s, it struck me that these pigments have a visceral aesthetic personality and a more subtle chemical composition that gives clues into how art can better be conserved. However, these vivid pigments are out of view. Though integral to the success of curation, conservation lives and breathes in the confines of laboratories and unmarked floors of museums. Yet, despite this seclusion, conservation’s devotion to preserving history has earned it continuing legacy built on the dialogue between artistic and scientific expertise.

A soft piano melody fades slowly into the sharp snap of a snare drum and a deep and moody bassline. “Now as we prepare for our liftoff, you’ll need only two things to direct your course: your ears and your soul. I bring to you the Robert Glasper Experiment—experimentation for meditation,” Shafiq Husayn croons smoothly on the first track of the Robert Glasper Experiment’s newest album, “Black Radio.” Husayn, known for performing with the hip-hop group Sa-Ra, is one of many artists featured on “Black Radio,” which includes Erykah Badu, Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def), and Lupe Fiasco, to name a few. In bringing together many prominent black artists to contribute to the album, Glasper, an accomplished pianist, gives his band’s form of experimental jazz popular appeal while exploring the different parts of “black radio”: funk, jazz, hip-hop, rhythm and blues, and soul music. The album successfully combines genres to create an eclectic fusion that spans multiple generations of black music.
“Black Radio” deliberately showcases the musical styles of the more famous black artists in its lineup. This makes sense from a commercial standpoint; the audience’s familiarity with the artists is a major contributing factor to the album’s initial buzz. It is not hard to pick out Lupe Fiasco’s distinctly melodic flow in the song “Always Shine” and Erykah Badu’s famously clear vocals in “Afro Blue.” The album does not have rely too heavily on these artists, however, because Glasper is inventive and jolting throughout. His light touch on “Always Shine” adds an element of delicacy to a song whose lyrics are otherwise heavy. “Would be the start of world peace / And the transformation of niggas / Like the transubstantiation of liquor / But that’s just turning them into blood / And we’ll be right back where we was,” Fiasco raps. Fiasco’s lyrics suggest pessimism regarding the trajectory of the black community, but they sound much less ominous couched in the smooth melody of the piece. While Fiasco might garner recognition for his role in the album, the Robert Glasper Experiment deserves praise in its own right for nuancing the sounds of his more familiar counterparts.
“Black Radio” also shows The Robert Glasper Experiment artfully transforming songs with non-African-American origins into sophisticated soul. On the closer, “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” Glasper’s band takes a song known for its unintelligible lyrics and loud, abrasive chorus and turns it into a modern jazz-fusion piece. The abstract piano voicings, bongos, and a vocoder help take the popular Nirvana song completely out of its original context, and the synthesized vocals pay homage to the autotune that is in vogue in hip-hop today. In this way, Glasper’s band showcases its ingenuity and versatility.
Though the Robert Glasper Experiment does an excellent job creating relaxing grooves for the songs on “Black Radio,” at times those grooves are jarringly interrupted. During the last minute of both “Always Shine” and “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” there are a series of loud electronic blips that distract from the otherwise polished songs. Probably an effort to introduce yet another unconventional element to the experimental album, those brief moments do not make sense in the context of the songs.
“Black Radio” on the whole has a smooth, organic feel. Black music is more than just catchy beats and heavy basslines; it is a fusion of ideas, feelings, and styles that come together to make something that people can relate to on a deeper level. Glasper’s fusion of these different genres highlights the compatibility of the different styles of black popular music and creates a soundscape with a soul of its own.

When Jay-Z and Kanye West released “Watch the Throne” last year, rap’s long and sordid love affair with ego reached its zenith. The two hip-hop icons recorded the album from a self-aware position of hip-hop world domination, and almost every track was filled with the kind of bravado that would make even the late Kim Jong-il blush. As the album title indicates, the artists regarded themselves as rulers of the kingdom of hip-hop, and for good reason—their combination of financial success, critical respectability, and cultural ubiquity is unprecedented in the genre. Six months later, there is an improbable, brash pretender to the throne. While Young Money rapper Tyga boldly asserts his ascendancy, Jay-Z and West should not be threatened in the least; his new lackluster album will prevent him from ever truly being coronated.
Tyga, a protégé of Lil Wayne—who is arguably the most prominent alternative to the “Watch the Throne” duo—sets out his agenda from the very outset of his major-label debut, “Careless World: Rise of the Last King.” Three lines into the opening title track, Tyga claims, “I realized I needed to rise and become king / My own destiny.” The notion of kingship is a trite trope of rap, and it pervades this album to the point where it is almost a concept album about King Tyga. Track after track explains Tyga’s status as the “young knight” and “young king,” his efforts to find an appropriate queen, and his success in achieving what he claims everyone dreams of: being “kings and queens.”
While this motif infects the entire album, the nadir is probably “Black Crowns.” The boastful song opens with the immortal synthpop chorus, “All I see is black crowns / King me ’cause this is my time now / So all you other niggas bow down.” Given the absurdity of the statement, along with the amusing verbing of “king,” it would be easy to dismiss Tyga’s claims as consciously absurd, but in the context of the album they are frighteningly sincere: Moments later, Tyga raps, “heavenly father, appoint me to the coronation.” This braggadocio is only rivaled by the title track, which has generated controversy for its unauthorized use of a Martin Luther King speech (the pun seems clearly intended). The speech extract and the song itself end with MLK’s assertion channeling Julia Ward Howe: “My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.” It seems clear that this quote is meant to refer to Tyga himself. Although the quote has been removed from the album following a legal challenge, its original placement clearly shows the rapper’s arrogant intentions.
However, the constant musings on his kingship are, to an extent, preferable to the non-monarchical themes. While most rappers of his ilk are casually misogynistic and tastelessly licentious, Tyga often crosses the line into actively violent and obscene, as evidenced by lines like “Got yo grandma on my dick,” and “Bitches jumping on my dick, hopping like it’s hopscotch.” He made his name four years ago with the endearingly kitsch “Coconut Juice,” which described his inclination for drinking that “3000 proof” beverage, but in his Young Money avatar, Tyga is entirely incapable of humor or irony. At times the lyrics are positively surreal in their banality. “Far Away” opens with a Vanessa Carlton-esque plaint: “Walk a thousand miles just to see her.”
What rescues “Careless World” from utter disaster is the willingness of Young Money, Lil Wayne’s record label, to support Tyga. The album is supremely well-produced and features a range of guest contributors that would be dizzying even for a more established performer: Pharell, Nas, Robin Thicke, J. Cole, Nicki Minaj, T-Pain, Busta Rhymes, Chris Brown, and, on two tracks, Lil Wayne himself all make appearances. Although the album is overly long, with 21 tracks clocking in over one hour and 20 minutes, it sustains its energy through the steady barrage of infectious hooks and beats that are to be expected from Young Money productions. “For the Fame” (with Chris Brown and Wynter Gordon), “Let it Show” (with J. Cole), and “This Is Like” (with Robin Thicke) stand out as moments of genuine auditory pleasure; they are melodic and crucially lighter in lyrical and musical tone than the rest of the album. These tracks privilege the talents of Tyga’s guests and are largely free of royalist rhetoric. The result is enjoyably silly pop-rap.
Amidst all these entertaining celebrity cameos, it is easy to forget quite how incidental Tyga himself can be to the entire enterprise. As a lyricist, rapper, and singer, he is so devoid of personality that “Careless World” would be scarcely different if any other artist from the Young Money stable were given the same tunes, beats, and guest stars. “Black Crowns” ends with an excruciating one-minute message from a woman, purportedly his mother, who just wants to tell him how awesome he is, how honored she is to be his mother, and how only he is fit to wear the black crown. Judging by this thin and unconvincing album, however, Tyga’s reign is likely to be brief and unacknowledged. At least his mother will still love him.

PRO: By Andrew R. Chow
There is no doubt that Gorillaz, André 3000, and James Murphy will all be paid handsomely for their latest Converse-financed collaboration, “DoYaThing.” With little incentive to be creative, the three titans could have easily mailed in a generic track matching the bland kitsch of Zooey Deschanel and Colbie Caillat Cotton Inc. commercials. Thankfully, “DoYaThing” is an energetic anthem that showcases Gorillaz’ trademark funkiness and André 3000’s effortless talent.
The best Gorillaz songs rely on an infectious beat. “DoYaThing” accordingly features blooping synths and a springy bass. Over the top, Damon Albarn spits lyrics that mean little but are delivered convincingly with a go-go-gadget flow.
The song kicks into another gear when André 3000 enters on a drum break: “New word—onomatopoeia. Boom!” He quickly launches into a rapid-fire verse, which, like Albarn’s, is lyrically weightless but undeniably fun. “Rap ain’t nothing but all the talking shit,” he declares, and he proceeds to weave many onomatopoeias, including “splooshy sploosh” and “bloopty bloop,” into his forceful and farcical rhymes.
While James Murphy does add his soulful whine to the chorus, the song’s drive comes from Gorillaz and Andre 3000 finding the perfect overlap between their styles. André’s motivated rhyming is clear evidence that he has not lost a step during the current Outkast hiatus. Albarn and the rest of Gorillaz, meanwhile, have been steadily churning out contagious singles for the last decade and show no signs of stopping. Some music purists might complain about the increasing commercialization of music, but it is hard to argue with results this strong. Hopefully, Neutral Milk Hotel, R.E.M., D’Angelo, and other reclusive greats will get calls from various shoe companies in the near future.

The new single by Gorillaz, “DoYaThing,” is undoubtedly funky. However, it is little else. With the grooving beat of a DJ gone ska and Damon Albarn’s usual nonsensical lyrics, “DoYaThing” makes a great placeholder on a longer Gorillaz playlist but ultimately lacks the catchiness or complexity to be a future party hit.
Back in the day, Gorillaz released a slew of eccentric and boundary-pushing singles which showcased a unique fusion of alt-rock, electronica, and hip hop. “Feel Good Inc.” and “Clint Eastwood” showed the band’s humor and sly ability to mash styles. Unfortunately, “DoYaThing” is simply an emulation of the band’s more successful work. André 3000 and James Murphy bring a touch of novelty to the classic sound of Gorillaz, but the end result is a confusing mess that wanders aimlessly.
The single features very similar chord changes to “Feel Good Inc.” but has much less pop than the original. Whereas “Feel Good Inc.” weaves in and out of various instrumentations and feels, featuring a lush guitar interlude before busting back into a fierce rap verse, “DoYaThing” features the same repetitive beat the whole way through. Indeed, the insistent beat simply becomes a backing track for the theatrics of André 3000, who treats the song as little more than the Converse advertisement it really is. When the lyric “Can we get an Outkast album now?” is repeatedly layered over the end of the song, it’s hard not to agree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before I heard “Simple Song” for the first time last month, I believed The Shins had been dead since 2008. Sure, James Mercer would give an interview with Pitchfork every once in a while and has consistently talked about the band’s “upcoming album” for the past four years. But for me The Shins were firmly situated in the past and their existence in the present was feeble at best.
The Shins were one of my first favorite bands. “Oh, Inverted World” was the soundtrack to my early high school years, and I’ve associated with that album—with its cadences, its lyrics, and Mercer’s idiosyncratic voice—a host of adolescent and idealistic meanings and emotions that dominated me in those days, including, embarrassingly enough, melancholic concerns about death. As that time of my life passed away, so too, it seemed, did The Shins. Their last album was released in my senior year of high school, and the band vanished when I got to college.
Then, as my graduation grew near, “Simple Song” surfaced as if the Shins arose from the grave.
The music video, released last week, features Mercer in the role of a dead father. His children gather to watch a video-will he had recorded before his death, which tells them that he has hidden the deed to the house somewhere and that whoever finds it first will be left everything. Most of the video is a frantic search through the house with flashback sequences of an equally chaotic past littered throughout. A younger hipster-cum-troll dad Mercer can be seen playing the song, backed by a band of his reluctant children.
When the deed is found, it is revealed that Mercer was kidding. He had sold the house already and had arrangements for it to be demolished that very afternoon. Everyone escapes the wrecking ball, though barely. The last scene of the video is of the various family members looking visibly happier than they did before, though they are covered in debris. A couple rediscovers one another in the commotion and shares a passionate kiss—a classic comic archetype—all due to Mercer’s elaborate posthumous plan.
Death is clearly a prevailing theme in the video—there are several shots of Mercer singing while he’s lying down in a coffin—but this fascination is surprisingly optimistic. The video explores the possibility of existing and impacting even after death.
The Shins of course, never really were dead. But even if they were, I was foolish to think that their music could no longer have a significant place in my life and even more foolish to quarantine it to the past. The seamless incorporation of flashbacks into the music video is telling: We keep the dead “alive” through remembering.
“Simple Song” is typical of The Shins in its masterful yet elegant songcraft. Moreover, its incredible polish and density of instrumentation surpasses anything I’ve heard from the Shins before. I don’t think I could ever like the upcoming “Port of Morrow” in the same way I did “Oh, Inverted World,” if for no other reason than that new album comes at a completely different time in my life, when I’m perhaps no longer as impressionable as I was when I first encountered the band. Still, “Simple Song” has given me reason to remember The Shins again, and they’re a band I want to keep alive in my mind.

“Fix the world.” This seems to be the gist of the task assigned to Harvard students in the so-called President’s Challenge, an initiative unveiled last week at Harvard’s Innovation Lab by University President Drew G. Faust. Her challenge asked Harvard affiliates from both the College and the graduate schools to come up with an innovative, social entrepreneurial solution to address problems including clean air and water, education, and global health. Harvard is offering a $100,000 prize to be shared by the three top student groups that produce the best work in answer to these pressing issues. Bold and ambitious to say the least, Harvard’s I-Lab seems to be the place that our administration believes can cure the world’s ills.
Clearly, Harvard is home to an intelligent population of young minds. We are, however, by no means home to the only concentration of bright individuals devoting themselves to addressing humanity’s greatest challenges. Many have in fact devoted their entire lives, not simply extracurricular time at college to these pursuits. The notion that ad hoc coalitions of young adults can succeed in endeavors in which so many others have yet to break through seems at once idealistic and a bit presumptuous.
While Harvard should not be faulted for teaching students to be idealistic, other recent programs and initiatives have similarly strayed too close to serving as nothing more than high profile photo-ops. Such photo-ops are themselves not inherently detrimental. Harvard occupies an elevated place on the world stage, so it is allowed to show off its talent pool from time to time. But these events become problematic when they distract from legitimate functions and goals that Harvard should be striving for. While it would be great if students could come up with solutions for clean water problems, not to mention global hunger while they’re at it, Harvard ought not to let such pursuits distract from its real mission—education. By focusing rather on classroom instruction on these problems instead of collaborative group work, Harvard graduates would be prepared with more than just their brains and a designated space across the river to combat the world’s worst crises.
A fundamental purpose of the President’s Challenge seems in fact to assign purpose to the newly built I-Lab. A $20 million building near the Harvard  Business School in Allston, the I-Lab was constructed after the administration shelved the construction of the new Science Complex development on its extensive Allston property. The motive behind the I-Lab is no doubt a well-intentioned one, to connect ambitious, entrepreneurial students with other like-minded peers, but at present its actual function seems nebulous at best. In its most useful capacity, the I-Lab would provide space for post-graduates to work in start-ups, but instead it has become the nexus of distracting mixers and eye-catching but ambiguous administration initiatives. If the President’s Challenge is to become a main feature of the I-Lab, it remains to be seen what will happen to this space after the top three student groups have received their $100,000.
The I-Lab has been heralded as a way to promote social entrepreneurship that will give back to the Allston community, but a serious question mark remains as to how much the lab and the President’s Challenge can actually benefit the local population.  While the entire world would certainly benefit from clean air, clean water, education, global health, and personal health—the Challenge’s stated target areas—none of this is likely to address the fundamental needs of a local population that has been badly served by Harvard’s ambitious and unfulfilled building projects. If the I-Lab is merely the latest effort to make reparations to a yet-uncompensated community and show the rest of the world that Harvard does care about Allston, then the University can frankly still do much better. Allston’s residents might get more out of the mini golf course Harvard initially installed to mitigate their anger.  Encouraging innovation is one thing, but cleaning up the mess in Allston is quite another.

Much ink has been spilled, rightfully, about the devastating effect of sexual assault on its victims, as well as the malignant persistence of violence against women in our society and our university. Many of these accounts highlight the pernicious, sexist social structures that allow some men to treat women as no more than objects of sexual gratification.
Despite these efforts, many still consider sexual violence a niche, feminist issue. As such, they pay lip service to the depravity of sexual assault without truly appreciating it for what it is: an epidemic of violent crime. In fact, the epidemic of sexual violence is, importantly, an issue of failed law enforcement. Our ability as a society to curb this behavior is so drastically insufficient that one in six American women (and a higher rate of college students) is a survivor of completed or attempted rape.
I do not use the term “epidemic” lightly; there is simply no other word for a pattern of malicious criminal activity that pervades our culture so thoroughly as to touch everyone by a single degree of separation. (If you do not think you know someone who is a survivor, you are probably wrong.) Many people react to the jaw-dropping statistics about sexual assault by presuming that there must be something wrong with the definition of the crime; that many of these cases must be innocuous, mislabeled, or fictional. Yet such reactions evidence the most malignant nature of the epidemic: that it goes so unspoken as to appear fictional to the fortunate majority. The truth is that the cases reported in these statistics consist of unambiguous rapists and rape victims. Furthemore, the outsize public attention on false accusals rests on shaky ground. After all, recent research has found than the percentage of rape accusations that are determined false hovers somewhere in single digits. Yet, despite the millions of rape survivors, shockingly, only about six percent of rapes in America lead to jail time. That means that of the 17 million American women who are survivors of rape or attempted rape, 16 million were assaulted without that recourse against their assailant.
There is an important relationship between the likelihood that an offense will lead to imprisonment and how often people commit that offense. In his recent book, The Better Angels of our Nature, Steven Pinker notes that during the 1960’s, violent crime surged as the likelihood that a crime would lead to an arrest was cut in half by a newly permissive criminal justice system. It is certainly not outlandish to claim, as Pinker does, that laws are only effective when reliably enforced. A sporadically enforced prohibition makes the accused feel singled out rather than guilty and does little to deter the crime. And as far as unenforced prohibitions go, rape is exceptional.
Considering that a mere six percent of rapes lead to jail time, we must admit an uncomfortable truth: that we live in a state of de facto rape legalization. This may sound bizarre, considering that rape is heavily criminalized statutorily. Yet, insofar as one can reasonably expect to be punished for illegal activity, rape in America simply does not count. The rapists among us—those who sit next to us in class, play on our teams, live in our entryways—victimize women with impunity 94 percent of the time.
Unfortunately, this problem cannot be solved by simply putting more police on the street. The greatest obstacle to prosecution has little to do with the availability of law enforcement officials. Sixty percent of rapes and sexual assaults are never reported to the police at all—a strange cultural artifact of the stigma of sexual assault in our society. Furthermore, some studies suggest date rapists suffer the delusion that women want to be raped, although they may not put it in such frank terms. These men, who consciously disregard women’s autonomy and disrespect their bodies, likely do not consider themselves rapists.
Most rapists pass unnoticed in society, accumulating victims and going unpunished. One study has shown that five percent of men attempt and commit over a quarter of sexual assaults, averaging five victims each during their life prior to the survey. Another found that fewer than ten percent of men committed over 90 percent of attempted or completed rapes. If the number of assailants seems high, its because the law is not acting as a deterrent. Since rapists have little reason to anticipate repercussions for their crimes, the current rate of attempted and completed rape reflects that of a society where it is legally permitted.
These features may make the enforcement of laws against rape difficult, but we are not incapable of the task. There are many avenues by which to increase the level of prosecution. The most obvious is utilizing education campaigns to reduce the percentage of unreported incidences of rape.
More importantly, we must root out those who commit sexual assaults and prosecute them. I do not wish to live in a society that half-heartedly seeks to provide safety for its people. The roadblocks to meaningfully outlawing rape are many, but the first step is creating awareness of the problem. Rape is a crime and should be treated like one.

On Feb. 2, legislation reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee by a party-line vote of ten to eight, with all eight Republican committee members voting against it. Given the proven track record of VAWA, such partisan opposition is difficult to understand. The original law was passed by Congress in 1994 and was renewed in 2000 and 2005 with strong bipartisan support. Since its original passage, the legislation has facilitated a more than 50 percent increase in reporting of domestic violence. The reauthorization measure includes better protections for LGBT victims of domestic violence, expanded tribal jurisdiction concerning domestic violence, and an increased quota cap for the granting of special visas to undocumented immigrants who report as victims. Senator Chuck Grassley spoke for the Republican membership of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he explicitly voiced opposition to expanding VAWA’s purview out of a fear that the bill is trying to “protect too many victims.” His argument is unfounded and doesn’t face the realities and data surrounding domestic violence.
VAWA’s reauthorization legislation includes provisions that enable LGBT victims of domestic violence to report incidents without fear of discrimination at help centers. It also provides grants for programs providing services to LGBT victims of domestic violence. Senator Grassley complained that, “Advocates of this provision haven’t produced data that shelters have refused to provide services for these reasons.” Such an allegation ignores a recent report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs which states “LGBTQH survivors of intimate partner violence encounter a lack of access to safety and support when they experience violence.  More survivors in 2010 (44.6 percent) were turned away from shelter than in 2009 (34.8 percent)... Additionally, in 2010, NCAVP saw 54.4 percent of survivors seeking an order of protection were denied one.” It would be perplexing for Senator Grassley and his Republican co-workers to continue resisting the reauthorization of VAWA on the grounds that a LGBT anti-discrimination provision is “only a political statement.”
The reauthorization of VAWA grants special jurisdiction for tribal governments to prosecute domestic violence offenders who may or may not be associated with the tribe. Senator Grassley is concerned that such a provision “needs more thought,” asking, “Why would Congress, should it decide for the first time to make such a change, do so on a bill to reauthorize VAWA?” The answer is actually fairly straightforward. A report released by the Department of Justice revealed that in the U.S., “the rate of violent victimization among American Indian women was more than double that among all women.” In Amnesty International’s 2007 report on sexual violence against Native Americans, a full chapter details the many ways in which the overly complex issues of jurisdiction are exploited by non-tribal perpetrators of violence against women on tribal land. A group of professors from the Departments of Sociology and Criminal Justice at the University of Delaware and University of North Carolina wrote in a research report for the Department of Justice that “less than half of all violent victimizations against American Indian and Alaska Native women are ever reported to police.” Given the evidence, it is understandable why Susan B. Carbon, Director of the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice, applauded the special jurisdiction measure as necessary to “strengthen tribal responses.” Senator Grassley’s support for the jurisdictional status quo does not recognize the level of harm for Native American women that such bureaucracy abets.
Many victims of domestic violence who are undocumented immigrants fear reporting incidents because of the risk for deportation. VAWA has had longstanding protections for any undocumented immigrant who comes forward to report an incident, allowing for the granting of up to 10,000 special visas for victims of violence. The reauthorization raises this cap to 15,000 special visas. Senator Grassley objects that raising the cap would allow VAWA to be "manipulated as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for foreign con artists and criminals." The Senator’s fear-mongering is unwarranted for an already highly selective application process that strongly suggests undocumented immigrants provide “evidence of the abuse, such as reports and affidavits from police, judges and other court officials, medical personnel, school officials, clergy, social workers, and other social service agency personnel” if they wish to receive a special visa.
Senator Grassley’s objections to reauthorizing VAWA are insubstantial. The eight Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee and any of their colleagues who are planning to vote against the legislation on the grounds that it protects “too many victims” ought to reconsider their position before the law reaches the floor for a vote. In the 18 years since VAWA was first passed, it has provided highly successful data-driven solutions to domestic violence—now is not the time to stop its remarkable progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before coming to Harvard, I spent a summer at a biochemical company in Monheim, Germany, working alongside other interns in an insecticide laboratory. Impressed by my colleagues’ knowledge, I assumed they were biochemistry students at university exploring a potential employer. I soon discovered, however, that they were students from advanced technical colleges completing the practical components of their programs. In fact, a majority of the full-time employees in my department doing work of a complex scientific nature had vocational rather than strictly academic qualifications. This is strikingly different from the norm in the U.S., where the minimum requirement for similar jobs is typically a bachelor’s degree.
This first experience at a German workplace gave me the impression that German society strongly values the variety of skills and talents that their education system is designed to produce—and not just in theory. The German system offers different vocational and academic options within a comprehensive structural framework, with many permeable options for students as they progress through secondary and tertiary education. For students preparing for higher education, for instance, there is the option of a purely academic pathway.  At the same time, there exist multiple other vocational or combined tracks, each with different emphases on academic study, vocational theory, and practical training supported by employers. This pervasive structural incorporation of vocational training into the education system allows graduates with different skills and expertise to be respected in society regardless of the perceived “prestige” of their chosen professions.
As such, it is unsurprising that only approximately 20 percent of German students opt to earn university degrees. Compared with the 68 percent of U.S. high school graduates who were enrolled in college in 2010, the differences between the two systems become apparent. In the U.S., there has been growing concern over the lack of structural vocational education, with some expressing the view that there are simply too many young people in college. College degrees, many argue, are so ubiquitous in the U.S. that they are no longer a reliable indicator of either knowledge or skills.
Known worldwide for consistently producing both cutting-edge ideas and world-class products, Germany is in no way lacking in either academic or technical talent. Rather, the diversity of respectable paths that are incorporated into the structure of all levels of the education system allows students to choose the paths that suit them best. This is in stark contrast to the system in the U.S., where it seems that the public response to the ever-increasing demand for an educated workforce has been to create still more academic options, resulting in a situation in which—to use a generalization—many students earn college degrees but acquire neither academic knowledge nor practical skills.
Many employers in the U.S. are starting to address this issue, which to them amounts to a serious crisis in workforce skills. With admirable foresight, they are building comprehensive training programs to encourage long-term, skilled employment. Some industry leaders are even pushing for the reincorporation of vocational options into public education. Beyond these sincere efforts, however, the U.S. needs to recognize the importance of fostering the right social context for the successful implementation of a structural vocational education system.
Germany has a relatively liberal, homogeneous, equal, and individualistic society where there is a pervasive understanding of the inherent value of a population with different strengths. Perhaps because of Germany’s cultural history, the modern perception of “education” still acknowledges the dissociation between “Bildung” and “Ausbildung”—or the ideal of whole-person humanistic development and the training that prepares one for a vocation. There is an understanding in German society, reflected by the humanistic curriculum that introduces literature and philosophy even to secondary students, that one can be an educated person in a classical sense even if one chooses a more technical vocation. Indeed, my experiences working, studying, and living in various parts of Germany have shown me that German society respects vocational training because everyone is expected to strive for this humanistic ideal of education regardless of the nature of the practical path that one chooses.
This is not to say that a system like Germany’s does not create certain systemic problems of inequality and inefficiency or that the U.S. cannot exhibit social support for such a system without a similar cultural tradition. Rather, there is room to learn from several aspects of the German model and to contextualize them for the U.S.. In particular, we need to recognize that the most important first step is to raise the social prestige of non-academic pathways so that students from all backgrounds can view them as genuine options. This will take a renewed cooperation between employers and the education system to make vocational options both attractive and stable and to promote the idea that there are multiple pathways to success. Only then could we shift from a system in which college is indiscriminately seen as the right path to a system in which there is a right path for everyone. This shift has serious potential to ameliorate the crises in the workforce and in higher education, and it might even prove to be a step forward for educational equality.

Although students in Quincy House will be spread out among five buildings next year as Old Quincy undergoes renovation, residents say that they welcome the increased variety and quality of rooming options offered by the temporary housing.
Come April, students in Quincy will participate in the annual housing lottery. But this year, with Old Quincy serving as a test project for the College’s House Renewal program, administrators have made adjustments to the rooming assignment system, including the elimination of “senior standing.”
Next year, students will have the additional option of living in three apartment buildings in the Square, dubbed “swing housing,” in addition to New Quincy and DeWolfe.
In an email sent out to Quincy residents last week, House Masters Deborah J. and Lee Gehrke wrote that each suite in the swing housing has a kitchenette and its own private bathroom. Although most bedrooms will be for two students, there will be “a few single rooms scattered throughout,” the email read.
Lisa L. Hoffman ’13, who has lived in Old Quincy for the past two years, said spaciousness is her top priority for rooming next year.
She said her ideal rooming situation would be to live in a single within a suite with a kitchen. The swing housing, Hoffman said, meets these requirements.
“Also, living above J.P. Licks is pretty tempting,” she said, referring to Fairfax Hall, a swing housing option on Mass. Ave. that is also home to her favorite ice cream shop.
Other students said they would not mind the distance as long as they have large rooms.
Martha R. Farlow '13, who has also lived in Old Quincy for two years, said the interior of the building is in “definite need of renovation.”
“The walls are paper thin, the bathroom is falling apart, and the wooden floors are scratched,” Farlow said.
Though she does not mind the swing spaces' distance from the Quincy dining hall, Farlow said she would lottery for swing housing only if her blocking group of five people could all be housed in one building and each get a single.
Likewise, James J. McCune '14 said he and his blockmates are aiming for a space with the most room.
“If that is the swing housing, so be it,” he said.
Quincy House Committee co-chair Scott J. Yim ’13 said swing housing is ideal for “people who want an apartment style, off-campus kind of experience.”
As a HoCo co-chair, Yim said he would prefer to live close to the main hub of the House near the dining hall, the courtyard, and other social spaces in Quincy. Yim and his roommates will instead lottery for a four-person duplex on the sixth floor of New Quincy.
The three buildings for swing housing will be located in Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton St., Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Ave., and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn St. A total of 180 students will live in these alternate buildings.

A study led by Harvard Medical School professor and gerontologist Douglas P. Kiel has become the focus of attention once more after the Department of Health and Human Services alleged that efforts to correct the study’s ethical violations were insufficient.
The Office of Human Research Protections issued a follow-up letter on Feb. 17 to Kiel and two of his colleagues regarding their corrective action plan for addressing previous infractions in their research methods.
Kiel’s research team—which gave more than 2,000 subjects hip-protective underwear that was padded on only one side—had failed to inform the participants about the risk of “falling more often to the ‘protected hip’ side,” according to a June 23, 2011 letter from the HHS Division of Compliance Oversight.
The HHS-OHRP has said that it is dissatisfied with the corrective action plans proposed by Kiel and his team in response to the first letter notifying the researchers of their violation.
The proposed plan did not clearly define the populations that needed to be notified and the draft letters were missing crucial information that would be helpful to study participants, according to HHS Compliance Oversight Coordinators Lisa Buchanan and Lisa A. Rooney in their Feb. 17 letter.
The study, called the Hip Impact Protection Project (HIP PRO), was launched in 2002 by Kiel, Jay S. Magaziner of University of Maryland School of Medicine, and Stanley J. Birge of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
It was intended to “assess the efficacy of hip pads in preventing hip fractures,” wrote Rachel J. Whitehouse, vice president of communications at Hebrew SeniorLife, in an email statement. Hebrew SeniorLife is home to the Institute of Aging Research where Kiel is based.
“The Feb. 17 letter from the OHRP was a procedural step, primarily focused on asking all three institutions involved in the HIP PRO study to more tightly focus and coordinate their subject notification plans. OHRP will not close this matter until the subject notification process is settled,” Whitehouse wrote.
Whitehouse said that Hebrew SeniorLife is taking the appropriate steps to implement the corrective actions that were outlined in the Feb. 17 letter.
The federal health investigation is not the first time that Kiel been implicated in a legal controversy.
In 2008, Kiel was sued by HipSaver—a hip protector manufacturer—for commercial disparagement. HipSaver representatives argued that Kiel’s paper, which included the results from his study, was not accurate in claiming that all hip protectors are ineffective. The case was dismissed in 2011.

Filmmaker Helen Whitney discussed four very different groups of outsiders—Trappist monks, targets of a Communist witch hunt, young gang members, and mentally ill adults—through the lens of spirituality in a lecture in Memorial Church.
Whitney screened clips from four of the earliest documentaries in her long career as a screenwriter, producer, and director.
She described her films as “a spiritual autobiography” that illuminates both her internal experience and her interest in learning about the lives of marginalized factions of society.
Her lecture on Monday, the first of three consecutive nights of speeches she will deliver in Memorial Church, traced the first part of that autobiography, beginning with the unexpected death of both of her parents when she was 11 years old.
After her parents died, she said, “I became an outsider, looking in on what used to be my normal life through a very dark glass. I had to start asking the big questions earlier than I would have liked.”
Her first attempt at an answer was “Youth Terror: The View from Behind the Gun.” While making this documentary, which dealt with teenage crime in Newark, Brooklyn, and Harlem, Whitney was robbed, beaten up, and treated for wounds in an emergency room.  “Though I hungered to enter worlds radically different than mine, this was scarier and more different than I had planned,” Whitney said.
Her next project brought her to a more serene environment: St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Mass. Her intent in making a documentary on monks’ lives, she said, was to revive the idea of the monastery, which she felt had lost resonance in modern times.
Introducing Whitney’s lecture, religion professor Diana L. Eck said that Whitney’s films “offer extraordinary explanations of some of the most profound and complex questions of our time.”
Eck added, “This is a woman who is deeply educated in the world, in the wells of human experience, and you will see this in her films.”
Mable Chan, a researcher at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, said she attended the lecture on a whim.
“I came in with an open mind to let her guide the narrative and the film” Chan said. “It was beyond anything I’d ever seen in a church setting. It was refreshing. It was powerful.”
Whitney said that she hoped to demonstrate that “a life in film, even though financially precarious, is one of the most humanizing careers a person can have.  You come to respect the mystery of the otherness of other people.”
“It can’t help but enlarge your heart and your brain,” she said.

When Lady Gaga travels, paparazzi and packed concert halls typically follow.
However, when the pop sensation blazes through Harvard Yard on Wednesday, she will bring a research symposium and a youth boot camp in her wake as well.
Lady Gaga will announce the creation of her new charity, the Born This Way Foundation, at an event in Harvard’s Sanders Theatre on Wednesday afternoon. The foundation’s launch will be marked by a series of events around Harvard throughout the day which share the foundation’s focus on bullying in the 21st century.
In the morning, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society will host a symposium on the manifestation of bullying online, according to Graduate School of Education Director of Communications Michael G. Rodman.
Next, the California Endowment, a health organization which is sponsoring the new Born This Way Foundation, will hold a Youth Advocacy Boot Camp at the Ed School. The boot camp, which California Endowment spokesperson Brandon Hersh described as a leadership summit focused on the theme of bravery, is open to any attendees from the Harvard community. Eighteen young people from various regions of California have been invited to the program.
“The key idea is how to create change in [the participants’] community,” Hersh said.
Hersh said that his foundation decided to support Lady Gaga’s effort in order to bring its health-focused message to a wider audience.
“We want to reach a few million kids. Health happens in our school, in our neighborhood, in our grocery stores. Everything we do affects our health. We want to get our message through,” Hersh said. He added that in Lady Gaga, the California Endowment “found not only a great megaphone, but also a genuine supporter living as who she is.”
The Ed School will host a second youth summit that same day on the theme “Prevent Bullying, Create Caring Communities.” Students from Cambridge and Boston will participate in this forum. The youth who will be flown in for the California Endowment’s event will also attend the second summit to share their personal stories of bullying, according to Rodman.
The main event of the day will feature guests from a variety of fields: entertainment magnate Oprah Winfrey, author and speaker Deepak Chopra, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen G. Sebelius, and Harvard Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree.
Rodman declined to state the format of the event or answer the question on the minds of many—whether Lady Gaga will sing.
The Ed School raffled off a few coveted invitations to the event through a contest on its Facebook page. About 2,100 people entered the raffle for just five tickets.
The Undergraduate Council is also raffling off an undisclosed number of tickets to College students.
For those who do not get tickets, the event will be simulcast at the Ed School in Askwith Hall and Larson Hall, at the Berkman Center in Austin Hall, and online.
The Born This Way Foundation will also park a bus outside of the Science Center to distribute information about the organization throughout the day, according to Rodman. Whether or not Lady Gaga sings in Sanders, the bus will blare music.

A conference considering a one-state solution to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict at the Harvard Kennedy School next week has provoked strong reactions from supporters and detractors alike.
Harvard students and alumni have signed an online petition calling on the University to withdraw all financial support and distance itself from the event.
In response, speakers and sponsors of the “One State Conference” sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust and Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 on Monday in defense of the conference.
The conference, which will be held on Mar. 3 and 4, is sponsored by Justice for Palestine, the Palestine Caucus, the Arab Caucus, the Progressive Caucus, and the Association for Justice in the Middle East. Its organizers include affiliates from the Kennedy School, the Law School, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The letter written to Faust and Ellwood called criticism of the conference “completely and entirely baseless” and urged the University to maintain its connection with the conference and the ideas expressed there.
One of the letters’ signatories, Nimer Sultany, a doctoral candidate at the Law School who will be speaking at the event, said he is participating to consider alternatives to the current “impasse” in the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
“There is a need to rethink alternatives...that would achieve peace that is based on justice and equality for all, rather than the domination of the stronger party,” Sultany wrote in an email.
The petition opposing the conference accused the event of propagating a manifestation of “new anti-Semitism.” The petition, which went live last Wednesday, has already garnered more than 2,000 signatures.
In addition to its demand that Harvard withdraw all financial support for the conference, the petition also urged the University to prevent the conference from using University facilities and to remove Harvard logos from the conference’s website.
Although protesters acknowledged the speakers’ right to free speech, petition signers took issue with Harvard’s financial backing of the conference.
“People have a right to speak their minds. That’s not the issue,”  said Gabriel M. Scheinmann ’08, one of the petition’s creators. “They don’t have the right to do it on the dime of others.”
Scheinmann said that the petition has already achieved some of its demands. The Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs have both removed their logos from the conference website since the petition went up, and a disclaimer has been added to the website, stating that the views raised in the conference do not represent those of Harvard University.
Joshua B. Lipson ’14, a Crimson editor on the editorial board and co-president of Harvard Students for Israel, said that he agrees in principle with a lot of the objections that have been raised about the conference, but did not sign the petition.
“In an ideal world, it wouldn’t be happening at Harvard,” Lipson said.
However, he added that “the petition’s aim is missing the fact that Harvard offers institutional support to all kinds of student groups in the name of [free] speech, even those we may find distasteful or ill-informed.”
“It’s a drastic measure to ask to revoke the University’s provision of space,” Lipson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The announcement of the upcoming launch of Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation has brought national attention to Harvard’s anti-bullying campaign in recent weeks, but anti-bullying has long been on the minds of those at the Graduate School of Education.
Michael G. Rodman, the Ed School’s director of communications, said he thought Lady Gaga chose to partner with the Ed School for her upcoming event because of its dedication to anti-bullying efforts.
The Education School was the first school at Harvard to release an iteration of the “It Gets Better” video, publishing its own version last July. The “It Gets Better” campaign uses candid testimonials from adults in the LGBTQ community to assure and encourage LGBTQ youth who may face bullying or harassment.
The “It Gets Better” video is just one of many anti-bullying projects currently underway at the Ed School.
A research team, whose members include Ed School assistant professor Stephanie M. Jones and professors from the University of Michigan, has developed a project to enhance students’ social, emotional, and cognitive skills to prevent bullying.
The initiative, known as SECURe, has launched pilot programs in kindergarten through third grade classrooms in Phoenix.
Trisha L. Ross, who works with Jones on the project, said SECURe lessons aim to give students the ability to regulate their own behavior and to increase positive classroom climate.
The issue of bullying has also found its way into the Ed School’s curriculum. Gretchen A. Brion-Meisels ’99, a fifth year doctoral student at the Ed School, is teaching a course this semester on bullying called “Establishing Safe Spaces for Adolescent Learning: Preventing Bullying and Victimization.” She said she hopes the course will synthesize current research on bullying and explore how to build positive school communities that would prevent bullying.
Those involved in this movement said that Lady Gaga’s foundation would bring positive attention to the subject.
Lee Hirsch, who screened his film “Bully” at the Ed School in February, said he thought Lady Gaga’s influence would be beneficial for the anti-bullying movement.
“It’s just pure awesome,” he said of the launch of the Born This Way Foundation.

In the first meeting led by recently elected mayor Henrietta Davis, the Cambridge City Council said farewell to a longtime official, heard concerns about after-school programming, and even took a moment to talk about Lady Gaga.
D. Margaret Drury, the city clerk of the past 20 years, swore in her interim successor, Donna P. Lopez.
Drury announced her retirement in mid-January and will be replaced by Lopez, the deputy city clerk.
Students and parents from two Cambridge schools attended the meeting to protest changes to the schools’ after-school program.
The two pre-kindergarten through eighth grade schools—the Amigos School, which educates students in both English and Spanish through a dual-language immersion program, and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School—currently share a building and conduct after-school programs jointly.
When the building, which is located across from Peabody Terrace, is remodeled next year, the two schools will move to separate temporary locations, and the Amigos School will take the after-school program with it.
The King School will relocate for the next three years to the Longfellow School, where an after-school program is already in place. Parents of King students said on Monday, however, that the Longfellow offerings lack the quality of the art, science, and music classes their children currently enjoy after school.
“They have very limited enrichment programs for after school,” said Wendy A. Noblett, whose daughter is a third grader at the King School.
Councillor David P. Maher attributed much of the ballyhoo to a lack of communication between the city and the public, but he said that he also understood the source of the parents’ concerns.
“You’re taking one building that services two schools, and you’re splitting them up, so the person they’re used to in those buildings is really only going with half the community,” Maher said. “I understand the angst about that.”
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 submitted a resolution congratulating Lady Gaga on the launch of her Born This Way Foundation, which will be feted at an event in Harvard’s Sanders Theatre on Wednesday.
Reeves—who attended the Cultural Rhythms celebration on Saturday, where John Legend accepted the Harvard Foundation’s annual “Artist of the Year” award—praised Legend and Lady Gaga for both their musical abilities and their philanthropic work.
The Council also recognized the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School men’s basketball team for its victory over Billerica on Monday night in the first round of playoffs. The team will face off against Westford on March 1.

Though construction of the new Charlesview housing complex in Allston-Brighton is slated to be completed ahead of schedule, Harvard’s plans for the current Charlesview site remain nebulous. According to The Community Builders, Inc.—the developers in charge of building the new Charlesview complex—the mild winter has allowed construction to continue ahead of schedule.
While The Community Builders originally planned for construction to finish in Oct. 2013, Jeffrey J. Beam, the Charlesview project director, said he hopes that work on the new site will in fact be finished late in the summer of 2013. The new housing complex, located a few blocks down Western Ave. from the current site, will utilize a variety of building designs, according to Beam. It will consist of 240 mixed-income units, which will be spread across 22 buildings made up of anywhere between 2 and 84 units.
In 2007, Harvard reached a land-swap agreement with Charlesview’s Board of Directors. The University traded a parcel it owned near Brighton Mills shopping center for Charlesview’s current five-acre plot, prime realty for the University since it abuts the Business School.
Beam said that the new Charlesview Apartments will better serve residents and blend more seamlessly into the neighborhood than the current 213-unit concrete complex. Beam said that the new units will be “more family friendly,” since Charlesview will now offer a variety of housing options and bring residents closer to the commercial heart of Western Ave.
“Whereas the old [Charlesview units] are isolated, the new ones are not,” Beam said.
Allston resident and community activist Tim McHale echoed Beam’s sentiments, saying he thought the new Charlesview was a “win-win” for residents and the neighborhood.
“It puts residents in the middle of an existing neighborhood instead of on the outskirts of a neighborhood,” McHale said.
The future of the old Charlesview, which sits on land that Harvard now owns, remains uncertain.
In Sept. 2011, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced that a site assessment, including consideration of new academic buildings, would be one of three prongs of the University’s first phase of its resumed development program in Allston.
Now, Allston residents are optimistic that as the University moves forward in planning for Allston, it will reveal more projections for the site.
“We’re all curious as to the disposition of the site once [Charlesview] moves out of there,” said Harvard-Allston Task Force member and neighborhood resident Paul Berkeley.
Berkeley said that he feels the University should look back to previous versions of its 2007 Institutional Master Plan when deciding on a use for the current site.
Prior to Dec. 2009, when the University halted construction in Allston, the development of an arts and culture complex was one oft-repeated proposal for the current Charlesview site.
Berkeley said he hopes that the University will consider that plan and others discussed by community members and developers.
“I don’t want to keep reinventing the wheel every time the plan shifts a little,” Berkeley said. “We should look at what we thought was best back then—that took a lot of time.”
Task Force member Harry Mattison said that this parcel of land has not been discussed much as of late, but he expects that it will come under the spotlight once the Task Force begins a larger dialogue about the Institutional Master Plan.
“I’m sure Charlesview will come up whenever the planning actually starts. It will be a key topic then,” he said.
He added that he thinks the most important piece of the planning will be to ensure that the site does not remain vacant, a concern that stems from the more than two-year freeze on construction of Harvard’s science center in Allston.
“The priority is that they have the site active and lively—whether that is some sort of interim use for some number of years or whether it means going immediately into construction for some unknown number of years,” he said.

A Harvard spokesperson confirmed Monday that no one was injured by the fire  that broke out a few minutes before 7 p.m. on Sunday on the fourth floor of an apartment complex on Harvard Business School’s campus.
Four apartments sustained lasting damage—one from the fire and three from flooding due to fire hoses, according to a statement released by spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall.
In total, news reports estimated the cost of the damage at more than $150,000.
The occupants of the four apartments will be offered alternate housing by the University until their residences are repaired, Marshall said.
Marshall wrote that the automatic fire alarm system in the building went off in response to heat and smoke and sent a signal to the Harvard Operations Center. The Boston Fire Department responded to calls from the Harvard Operations Center.
The fire’s cause has been reported as  electrical, most likely a power strip failure.
“The fire department was here very quickly,” said Yumee Song, a second-year MBA student at the Business School who lives on the floor where the fire broke out.
Once the fire department told onlookers that it was safe to return to their rooms, Song said, Harvard maintenance staff cleaned the building.
The cleaning efforts and safety checks prevented residents from entering the building until nearly midnight on Sunday night, the statement said.
The Soldiers Field Park apartment complex where the fire occurred contains a child care center and is billed as a good choice for students with young children.
Residents with families who were kept out of their rooms until late on Sunday night were offered overnight lodging on Sunday at the Doubletree Guest Suites near the Business School’s campus, Marshall wrote.

John A. Ausick ’13 never intended to run for a position on the Undergraduate Council, but he could just be Currier House’s next UC representative.
But Ausick said that someone impersonated him, using a fake email address, to declare his candidacy two weeks ago and send a candidacy statement to the UC Election Commission for Currier House’s special election.
Then, when Ausick’s name was accidentally left off the ballot when the online poll went live last Wednesday, the user of the email account pointed out the mistake, which forced a re-vote in Currier. Voting had opened at noon that day and was cut off at 9:30 p.m. Ballots cast during that period were thrown out. The Election Commission relaunched the online poll at midnight.
Only after this second election was underway did the UC hear from Ausick that he never intended to run for the position.
The Election Commission received a statement of candidacy two weeks ago from an account called jack.ausick@gmail.com, which UC Election Commission Chair Nicholas S. S. Pomata ’13 assumed was Ausick’s personal email address.
“I realize now that while most of my emails to the representatives were sent to Jack’s College email, all my one-on-one email exchanges were with jack.ausick@gmail.com,” Pomata said.
Ausick said he remembered receiving a series of emails to his College account about the election, but he assumed they were generic messages sent over the Currier mailing list.
But last Wednesday, Ausick received an email from Pomata, apologizing for failing to include him on the online ballot.
“I realized that I seemed to be a target of a very bizarre prank,” Ausick said. “I’m pretty sure I didn’t do anything to incite this. As far as I can tell, I was just randomly chosen for a prank.”
Discussing the decision to re-start the Currier election, Pomata said, “It seemed, at the time, the best thing to do to make the election fair.”
He added, “But I didn’t know at the time that it was a joke.”
Ausick said that he initially decided not to inform the Election Commission that he had been enlisted by an impostor because he did not want to slow down the election process even more.
“I didn’t want to mess things up again, so I figured it would be better if I just waited it out,” he said. “I haven’t been actively campaigning anyway, and I think there’s very little chance that I am going to win.”
Five other candidates on the ballot plus write-in hopefuls are campaigning for the two open spots.
UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said that the UC hopes to avoid such a situation in the future by accepting candidate declarations only from College email accounts, in accordance with current UC rules.
“Mistakes happen,” Bicknell said. “In the future, I’ll make sure that the Election Commission only accepts declarations from Harvard emails.”
Voting closes Tuesday at noon. Ausick’s name will remain on the ballot, according to Bicknell and Pomata.

Penn’s upset of the Harvard men’s basketball team Saturday altered the race for the 2012 Ivy crown. The final weekend of conference play will no longer be a coronation of the Crimson, as a number of scenarios exist in which Harvard does not end up with the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Here is what could happen depending on the outcome of next weekend’s games.
If Harvard wins its weekend matchups with Columbia on Friday and Cornell on Saturday, it will secure at least a share of the Ivy League Title. When those two teams came to Cambridge, odds makers gave Harvard a roughly 94 percent chance of winning each game. Those percentages will be lower when the Crimson take to the road, but Harvard will still be expected to emerge victorious in both contests. Its fate is no longer solely in its hands though, as the Quakers now will also have a say in who represents the league in the Big Dance.
Penn still has three games between them and a potential one-game playoff. If they beat Brown on Friday and Yale Saturday in the Palestra and then take down Princeton on the road and the Crimson goes undefeated next weekend, the two teams will meet with a spot in the NCAA tournament on the line. The two teams would also meet in a play-in game if they each lost once from here on out.
There is also a chance that Harvard could face the Bulldogs in a playoff game. The two rivals would face each other once more this year if Yale takes down Penn and Princeton, Brown or Princeton also beat the Quakers, and the Crimson loses one more game.
Harvard could also be left out of the postseason fun altogether if they lose twice this weekend, Yale wins out and Penn beats Brown and Princeton.
And then there is a chance of a three-way tie for the title. If any of the following scenarios play out, one team—based on its record against the other tied teams—would face the winner of a battle between the two other teams vying for an NCAA bid. Harvard, Penn, and Princeton could find themselves in this situation if Princeton wins out, Penn loses to Brown as well as Princeton, and Harvard loses twice more.
It’s also possible that Harvard, Penn, and Yale could duke it out for No. 1. If Yale wins out, Penn beats Brown and Princeton and the Crimson fall in either game this weekend. If Harvard were to lose both of its last two games, Princeton were to win out and Penn loses to both Yale and Brown, then the Crimson would find itself in a three-way tie with the Tigers and Bulldogs.
If these scenarios aren’t complicated enough, there is also a chance that Princeton, Penn, Harvard and Yale could all claim a piece of the Ivy League title. If Princeton wins out, Penn loses to Yale and beats Brown, and Harvard loses twice, the four squads would all duel for the tournament berth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before Saturday night, I tried not to think about it. But at this point, there’s no way around it.
Harvard basketball is cursed.
Towards the end of March in 1946, the Crimson suited up and headed to Madison Square Garden for the eighth NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament. In the first round, Harvard fell to Ohio State, 46-38, and the team was done about as soon as it started.
About three months later, in the bustling metropolis of Paris, France, an event far more significant took place. Early in July of 1946, the bikini first hit the shelves, beginning what is now the norm of women’s casual swimwear.
Harvard has not made the Tournament since then. Until recently, the team was rarely even close.
I am left to conclude that, for reasons I have yet to explain, the schism of the women’s bathing suit into two parts has kept the Crimson out of March Madness.
Yes, Harvard has fallen victim to the Curse of the Bikini.
Curses are, of course, nothing new to Bostonians. The Curse of the Bambino was only recently broken. The Curse of Eli Manning lives on.
But the curse which presently afflicts Harvard is of a different breed than what residents of Beantown are used to.
The Curse of the Bikini is much more like the Curse of the Billy Goat that has kept the Chicago Cubs out of the World Series for so many years.
Between 1946 and 2009, Harvard basketball had a grand total of 15 winning seasons. In the years that the team had any measure of success, it rarely even came close to an Ivy League title.
The Crimson has had its opportunities. In 1971, led by Fox NFL Sunday anchor James Brown and a set of talented recruits, the team finished 11-3 in the Ivies. And that was nowhere good enough to fend off Penn.
In the 1997, the team was 10-4 in league play. Nope.
For four seasons—2007 through 2010—Jeremy Lin played for Harvard. For those of you not familiar with Mr. Lin, he has appeared on the cover of Time Magazine and two Sports Illustrated covers in about 14 days, and more or less has singlehandedly brought the Knicks out of the dog house and into contention.
His best year? A 10-4 Ivy record during his senior year. The Crimson fell victim in 2010 to a Cornell squad that made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
And finally, in each the last two seasons, Harvard has more or less been one basket away from Madness.
In a 2011 Ivy League playoff against Princeton, Doug Davis hit a buzzer beater to send the Crimson to the NIT.
Saturday night, that Curse—well, frustration, for those of you who aren’t as superstitious—proved that it continues to reign free over Harvard basketball.
With a win, Harvard would have locked up at least a share of the Ivy League title, and for all intents and purposes, it would have sealed the Tournament berth.
In the final seconds of the game, co-captain Oliver McNally found Kyle Casey inside, who appeared hit the layup. Harvard looked like it had taken a one point lead with about three ticks left.
But the Crimson was called for a charge, and Harvard couldn’t foul the Quakers in the final moments of the game—another questionable call, really. I would say that the only thing that kept the student section from rioting was that it was too stunned to do so.
Barring any upsets in the final week of the season, Harvard may very well have to suit up against Penn for another Ivy League playoff in New Haven.
For Harvard fans, it’s tough not to be pessimistic at this point. And I can’t think of a better time for the Curse of the Bikini to rear its ugly head than at a playoff game at the start of Spring Break.
On the way back to campus after Saturday’s game against Penn, a passer-by asked what had happened in the contest. It took a few melancholic grunts from the students, but he eventually figured it out.
His response: “If I were you, I’d drink heavily.”
At least for the time being, that would probably help.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every father’s worst nightmare is losing a game of pick-up basketball to his child. Ed Gordon, father of Harvard sophomore Elise Gordon, is just happy to be a part of the spectacle.
That being said, a Gordon family game of two-on-two isn’t your typical backyard game of basketball. The three Gordon children, Drew, 22, Elise, 19, and Aaron, 16, put on quite the show behind their home in San Jose, Calif.
The Gordons have an impressive athletic resume. Drew, a senior power forward for University of New Mexico, is projected to be picked late in the first round of the NBA draft after stellar performances this season, including a double-double against No. 15 San Diego State and a 27-point, 20-rebound game against No. 11 UNLV.
Aaron has made headlines as a top-10 recruit nationwide and the No. 1 basketball recruit in California. As the power forward for Archbishop Mitty High School in San Jose, Aaron led the Monarchs to one state championship and has been called the next Blake Griffin. He has already garnered scholarship offers from New Mexico, Arizona, and Kansas.
Elise, a center on the Harvard women’s basketball team, has been fighting injury this season but holds some impressive achievements of her own. She won two California state championships in high school and benched pressed the bar 200 times in last years Bench Press for Breast Cancer charity contest—the most of any Crimson athlete.
“I have almost given up trying to win anymore cause my older brother is 6’10” and my younger brother is 6’8” and still growing,” said Elise, a government major in Pforzheimer House, who stands at 6’1” herself. “We have a little court in the backyard, and my dad is always trying to get in and trying to relive his prime and such. It gets competitive, but it’s always fun. My dad and I are on a team, and we have more of the fundamentals, whereas the boys have a bit more of the wow factor.”
Ed Gordon isn’t any slouch athletically either. After a college career playing basketball and football at San Diego State University, Ed went on to play a short stint in the NFL for the New England Patriots. He stands at an intimidating 6’6” in his own right.
“When I am home for too long my neck starts to hurt from looking up at everyone,” Elise said laughing.
The Gordon’s mother, Shelly Davis, is sidelined from the backyard games due to injury but was a talented hockey player in her youth.
“I am a Daddy’s girl all the way; They call me the princess in the middle, but my mom and I talk about everything together,” Elise said. “Dad still gets some solid baskets in the games, but he has come to grips with not being able to win all the time, while mom is sort of there with the camera and the hype. They are very supportive and just awesome.”
Despite the athletic success of their children, Elise’s parents say they tried to keep the Gordon children grounded.
“Raising them was a lot like any other kids I would have to imagine,” Ed Gordon remembered. “They were a bit more competitive in nature about everything, which was interesting and sometimes challenging, but they have been really easy kids. It was interesting to watch because sometimes I’d have to break it up and say, ‘Put the ball down, the game is over, let’s do something different,’ or else the level of competition would continue to escalate and what would start out as a fun game of horse would turn into a hard post-up or a hard slam-dunk.”
But the Gordon household is not just an incubator for athletic success and competition.
“[Growing up] was fun. It definitely got competitive, but the cool thing was that we are all so supportive of each other,” Elise said. “We would help each other out on our skills. It gets a little tense because we all want to surpass one another, but we are also always at one another’s sporting events supporting one another.”
Elise also says she grew up in an environment that fostered individual growth.
“It’s the old cliché ‘I can hit my brother or sister, but you better not.’ They are each other’s worst critics,” Ed said. “If they see something they don’t bite their tongues, but it is understood that it is all out of love. They expect the most from themselves and the most from one another.”
With Aaron still in California, Drew in New Mexico, and Elise at Harvard, the Gordons have managed to remain close despite the huge distance.
“It’s cool, you know, we always are texting each other ‘good job’ or ‘good luck,’” Elise said. “We are always in contact and keeping up with each other’s stat lines.”
Elise’s decision to come to the Crimson was not only based on her athletic prowess, but also her academic success.
“Well it wasn’t that hard of a decision for her to come to Harvard—I mean it is Harvard.” Ed said. “I think she was looking for something a bit more academic, and when Harvard contacted us that kind of became a no-brainer.”
With the success of her brothers as motivation, Elise is looking to improve her game and contribute both on and off the court for the Crimson.
“Well, off the court and on the court she of all three kids is the most headstrong in terms of once she gets something into her head, an idea of what she wants to do, she can’t sit on it,” Ed laughs. “She can be worked with, but she will get her goals done. She is very personable but very hardworking and a very special person. But I’m a dad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into last weekend, junior forward David Valek had two goals on the year for the Harvard men’s hockey team. When the buzzer sounded at the end of the third period on Saturday night, Valek stepped off the Bright Hockey Center ice with three times that number.
It was a do-or-die weekend for the Crimson (10-8-11, 8-5-9 ECAC). Harvard victories on Friday and Saturday nights would guarantee the team a top-four spot in the conference standings, assuring Harvard home ice and a first-round bye in the ECAC Hockey Championship.
And thanks to Valek, the team was able to do just that.
“As sometimes happens in big games, you need players to step up and make big plays,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “And David Valek stepped up and had a huge weekend. He can really shoot the puck, and it looked like this weekend he found some confidence to find that shooter’s touch. It couldn’t have come at a better time for us.”
The Crimson kicked off the weekend action on Friday night against St. Lawrence (13-17-3, 9-11-1 ECAC). The Saints struck first with a power-play goal just six minutes into the action.
It took less than a minute to even the score at one, when Valek found the back of the net following a missed shot from junior defenseman Danny Biega.
Valek continued to shine for the home team. The junior from Dunster House, who spent most of his childhood in his father’s native Croatia, added another goal in the third period, scoring on an assist from senior forward Daniel Moriarty.
Valek supplemented his strong offensive play with key contributions on the defensive end, finishing with six of the Crimson’s 15 blocked shots.
Although Harvard rode Valek’s strong play to a 4-1 victory, it was still too early for the Crimson to celebrate. Harvard still had to take care of business against Clarkson (15-15-6, 9-9-4 ECAC) on Saturday night in the Crimson’s final home game of the regular season to ensure the coveted first-round bye.
“Obviously after every win, the team is all excited, but to win back-to-back games in the ECAC is difficult,” Valek said. “[Saturday’s game] was pretty much already a playoff game for us. I think we had that mindset, that mentality, that even though we got it done on Friday, Saturday’s game was extremely important as well.”
The Golden Knights stormed out of the gates and took the lead in the first period. Unlike the previous night, Harvard did not have an answer in the opening frame. Instead, Clarkson capitalized on a five-on-three power play in the second period to grab the two-goal edge.
Following a power-play goal of its own, Harvard entered the third period down, 2-1. It was during this final 20 minutes that David Valek recaptured his magic touch from the previous night’s game.
The Zagreb, Croatia native knotted the score at two with a goal 2:07 into the third period, putting freshman forward Tommy O’Reagan’s pass into the back of the net.
Five minutes later, O’Reagan and Valek went back to work. O’Reagan blocked a shot on the defensive end and raced up the rink with the puck. He contributed his second assist of the day when he found Valek, who beat the Golden Knights goalie for the second time on the night to give the Crimson its first lead of the game.
Harvard shut down Clarkson in the third period, preserving the tenuous one-goal lead to defeat the visitors, 3-2.
With the victory, keyed by Valek’s second straight two-goal performance, the Crimson took control of third place in the ECAC, guaranteeing a first-round bye.
“That third period…[was] huge for us,” Valek said after the game. “It’s been a while since Harvard finished in the top four, especially third place. That was one of our goals, to get a first round bye, and that’s what we did. We knew it was our last home game, so we just laid everything out on the line.”
Donato was proud to see Valek’s hard work pay off.
“He has been such an unselfish player for us and done a lot of things to help us win games,” Donato said. “But to see him step up and score four big goals on the weekend is exciting. I’m happy for him because he works so hard.”
Despite his clutch play over the weekend, Valek attributes his personal success to a team effort.  He knows the Crimson will need performances like his in the coming weeks in order to win the ECAC hockey title.
“It was a big weekend for the whole team,” Valek said. “I had some family in town. I don’t know if that was a motivating factor, but it definitely didn’t hurt. At different times, people need to step up for the team, and this weekend it just happened to go my way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yet another Crimson standout has secured the opportunity to play in front of scores of NBA scouts. Following in the footsteps of Jeremy Lin '10, Harvard senior forward Keith Wright was named as one of 64 elite members of the Class of 2012 to be invited to the annual Portsmouth Invitational Tournament in Portsmouth, Va. 
 
The tournament, held Apr. 11-14, takes place less than thirty minutes by car away from Wright’s hometown of Suffolk, Va. 
 
“It’s a great honor, especially because that’s where I’m from," Wright said. "I used to go to the Portsmouth games when I was a sophomore in high school.”
 
 
Wright will compete on one of eight teams in a four-day single-elimination tournament. Other confirmed participants include Virignia’s Mike Scott and Xavier’s Tu Holloway, giving Wright the chance to prove his merit against best-in-class talent, in front of representatives for NBA teams. 
If he needs any extra motivation to perform, Wright should look no further than his own former teammate, current New York Knicks point guard Lin. In the 2010 tournament, Lin averaged 10 points and 6 assists per game. Though he went undrafted, the Golden State Warriors signed Lin to a two-year contract several weeks later, thanks in part to the attention he received from the Portsmouth Invitational.
 
But Wright has yet to confer with Lin about the matter.
 
“I talked to him...before the whole 'Linsanity' thing started," Wright said. "But I just want to leave him alone."
 
This weekend, the NBA sensation and Portsmouth alum has a date in Boston with the Celtics on Sunday, while the Crimson star and Portsmouth invitee has an Ivy League title to lock down with games at Columbia and Cornell this weekend.
 
“I plan on focusing on the now, but [the invite] is a great honor,” Wright said.

"Behold, our butter stinketh! — give us therefore, butter that stinketh not." With this cry, the Great Butter Rebellion of 1766, the first Harvard student protest ever recorded, began. Since then, student protests have continued to rock Harvard's campus over the years. In light of the Occupy Harvard movement, here's a look back at some of the ways in which Harvard students have stood up for what they believe in over the last centruy alone.
1961
When Harvard College President Nathan M. Pusey announced that Harvard diplomas would be changed from their traditional engrossed Latin form to printed English, 2,000 members of the class of 1961 gathered on the steps of Widener Library in a 3-day protest. Eventually, police were called in to disperse the protesters.
1966
During former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's visit to Harvard, the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) requested that he participate in a debate on the Vietnam War. When their request was denied, SDS members ambushed McNamara, hurling accusations at him and forcing him to climb on top of his car for protection. Eventually, the police helped the Secretary of Defense escape through underground tunnels.
1967
A recruiter from the Dow Chemical Company was barricaded for seven hours in the Mallinckrodt Lab as hundreds of students outside protested against the company's role in producing napalm for the Vietnam War effort.
1969
Hundreds of students invaded University Hall and forcefully ejected the deans and other employees. The protest focused on the University's role in the Vietnam War, and demands included abolishing Harvard's ROTC program. After several warnings to the students, College President Nathan M. Pusey called in the Cambridge police who violently removed the student protesters from the Hall, sending more than 40 students to the emergency room.
1970
A group of students supporting Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers Organizing Committee collected 1,700 signatures to persuade Harvard to ban suppliers that sold 'scab' (non-unionized) lettuce. Earlier that year the same group had urged a grape boycott. Harvard officials decided against the petition and maintained their lettuce-purchasing habits.
1986
In 1986, students constructed shantytowns in the Yard, which symbolized the living conditions of black South Africans, to urge the Harvard Corporation to divest from South Africa as a show of Harvard's disapproval of apartheid.
2001
Members of the Progressive Students Labor Movement (PSLM) demanded a living wage for Harvard's employees. For 21 days, they staged a sit-in of Massachusetts Hall, and students, alumni and some employees picketed and slept in tents pitched in the Yard at night. Within a month of the sit-in, almost all dining employees were granted pay above Cambridge minimum wage.

Instead of re-reading Suzanne Collins' popular "The Hunger Games" trilogy in anticipation of the March 23 movie premier, many are picking up "The Hunger Pains: A Parody". Written by the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, "The Hunger Pains" follows protagonist Kantkiss Neverclean as she competes in the second highest-rated reality television show in Peaceland.
The book, which was published on Feb. 7, has already reached number 27 on the New York Times paperback non-fiction list (If you're not sure how the book qualifies as non-fiction, neither is Flyby). The Lampoon has a history of publishing well-ranked spoofs. In 2009, the Lampoon released "Nightlight: A Parody," a send-up of Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" sensation.
Wary buyers who would like a taste before committing to the full 176 pages can read an excerpt or check out the book's trailer, featuring Thomas Lennon.
Not a fan of sci-fi? For readers who prefer reality, "Survivor," the original hunger pains television show, has returned for a 24th season, airing Wednesdays at 7 p.m. on CBS. Grab a snack and watch famished contestants battle it out for fame and fortune.

No, that's not a typo. On Wednesday, Lady Gaga will launch her Born This Way Foundation (BTWF) here at Harvard. The singer will not be the only celebrity on campus—actress/philanthropist/producer/talk show host Oprah Winfrey will be present to help launch the event as well. While Oprah's life may seem like an open book—she is notably candid about her rags-to-riches story—here are a couple of things you may not know about her, including an interesting fact about her name.
1. She is called by a name other than her own. She was originally named "Orpah Gail Winfrey" after a biblical character in the "Book of Ruth". Mispronunciation and consequent misspelling, however, led friends and family to refer to her as Oprah. It's probably a good thing since…
2. She named her production company Harpo–Oprah spelled backwards. Hapro Productions just doesn't have the same ring to it.
3. She's always been in the spotlight. Oprah was voted "Most Popular Girl" by her high school classmates and won the title of Miss Black Tennessee in 1972.
4. She suffers from chiclephobia, or the fear of chewing gum. According to Oprah, her grandmother used to save used chewing gum and proudly display it in a cabinet in their home. The collection so revolted Oprah that she banned gum chewing in her studio.
5. She changed the course of politics. By the estimates of economists Craig Garthwaite and Timothy Moore, Oprah's public endorsement of Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic Primary election gave the president one million additional votes over Hillary Clinton, cementing Obama's share of the Democratic vote.
If you weren't one of the lucky five to win the BTWF ticket lottery, never fear—highlights of the event will be featured on the Oprah Winfrey Network in the coming weeks.

We've published roundups on Jason Segel, John Legend, and Oprah Winfrey, and now there's Lady Gaga as well. Before the Mother Monster herself arrives in Cambridge this Wednesday to launch the "Born This Way Foundation" at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, here are some essential Lady Gaga facts every dedicated fan needs to know.
 
1. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, Lady Gaga's stage name comes from the Queen song "Radio Ga Ga." According to her former producer Rob Fusari, we have autocorrect to thank for Gaga's now famous moniker. "I typed 'Radio Ga Ga' in a text and it did an autocorrect so somehow 'Radio' got changed to 'Lady.' She texted me back, 'That's it.'"
 
2. She attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts but dropped out at age 19. "I loved NYU, but I thought I could teach myself about art better than the school could," she said. (Click here for a performance Lady Gaga gave at the 2005 NYU Talent Show.)
 
3. She is naturally a brunette. After being mistaken for Amy Winehouse one too many times, however, Lady Gaga dyed her hair blonde. "I want to be known for my own look," she said.
 
4. In 2010, she became the first individual with a record 10 million Facebook fans. Today, her fans number more than 48 million, putting her ahead of other popular figures like Justin Bieber, Adele, and Barack Obama.
 
5. She is often seen carrying a purple teacup in public. "I used to have tea at home with my mother every day...She [her teacup] makes me feel at home," Gaga explained.
 
6. To date, she has been nominated for 15 Grammy awards and has won five of them.
 
7. She thinks pants are superfluous and was almost arrested in 2009 in Chicago for wearing hot pants in public. "It's not that I don't like pants," she said, "I just choose not to wear them some days."
 
8. She is currently dating "Vampire Diaries" actor Taylor Kinney.
 
9. It has been rumored that she will make a cameo in Will Smith's upcoming "Men in Black III".
 
10. She has cited Donatella Versace and Peggy Bundy as two of her fashion icons.
