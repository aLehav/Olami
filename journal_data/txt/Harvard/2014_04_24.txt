After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps fitting for a play that deals so much in dreams, director Mikhaila R. Fogel ’16’s production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” offered college-age viewers a fantastical glimpse back to their childhood in the ’90s (and its attendant fashion nightmares). The show, which ran through April 20, gleefully mixed high and pop culture, featuring a stage bedecked in glowsticks and a musical tribute to “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” Though not perfect, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s utterly committed performances and campy take on classic theater made for an enchanting show that more than overcame its flaws.
 At the center of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” is a love quadrangle between the Athenians Hermia (Kara E. Roberts ’17), Lysander (Taylor A. Cressler ’14), Helena (Olivia L. Ball ’14), and Demetrius (Kevin T. Wittenberg ’14). When the four wander into the woods at night, they come into the middle of a feud between the fairies Oberon (Katherine E. Moon ’14) and Titania (Emilie G.C. Thompson ’16). Magical meddling in human affairs serves only to stir up further drama. As if two worlds colliding isn’t enough, Shakespeare saw fit to add a third: the forest also plays host to a troupe of actors incompetently rehearsing “Pyramis and Thisbe.” With so many different elements, balance is of the essence. Fortunately, this was something that this rendition largely accomplished.
The performances of the four central actors helped to draw out the play’s themes while never losing sight of its comedy. Prior to being enchanted by Puck, Cressler portrayed Lysander’s love for Hermia as sweet and demure; under the potion’s spell, he drops the doe-eyed look in favor of crude lunges and testosterone-fueled sparring, deftly limning the difference between love and lust, natural and unnatural. One of the most accomplished scenes of the production saw all four Athenians squabbling with each other onstage as the two men, victims of Oberon’s love potion, vie for Helena’s hand. Good blocking and high-energy performances ratcheted up the tension in the scene: Helena flips off Demetrius, Hermia jumps at Helena’s throat, and the men fight each other with a rising intensity that yet at moments has a balletic elegance. The growing violence of the lovers’ behavior underscored the duality of civilization and wilderness central to the play.
The players and the fairies were not to be outdone; among the latter group, the unquestionable standout was Moon, whose Oberon was both imperious and imperial. The smug self-confidence of her characterization made the artificial convention of the soliloquy seem natural—her Oberon is exactly the kind of person who would relish their own cleverness aloud to themselves. And the ragtag band of players provided some of the production’s most enjoyable moments thanks to all-around great comedic instincts. Portraying the talentless ham Nick Bottom, Ari D. Brenner ’14 put his improv-honed comedic chops to good use, rendering what might have been an insufferable character one of the production’s most funny and compelling. Cartoonish costuming by Juliet M. Snyder ’15 and Gina K. Hackett ’15 played up the troupe’s ridiculousness—Brenner was decked out in an eyesore of a tie, and Lelaina E. Vogel ’15 (playing the group’s overworked manager) sported a hairdo heaped high with scrunchies and topped off by a pair of crisscrossed chopsticks.
The production wrung every bit of comedy out of the script that they could, transforming even throwaway lines into laugh-out-loud funny moments. There’s nothing inherently funny, for example, about the bit part of Mustardseed, one of Titania’s gaggle of fairies; in the hands of Deng-Tung Wang ’16, however, lines without any humor in them turn into side-splitters thanks to his exaggeratedly deep voice and stern, deadpan delivery. The part of Robin Starveling (Gillian C. Stein ’15) was given new comedic dimensions thanks to the play’s genderbending; as the only woman among the players (who would originally all have been men), she acted furious at being denied the leading female role of Thisbe. Stein slung one-liners with bitterness worthy of “Daria,” and her frequent swigs from a hipflask (a smart move by prop designer Alice Abracen ’15) were a perfect set-up to her role in the play-within-a-play, Moonshine.
The one false note in the production, however, was in the characterization of Puck (Emily R. Zoffer ’17), who in this telling was more incubus than imp. The conversation between Puck and one of Titania’s followers (Vogel again) at the beginning of Act II featured an atmosphere of bizarre sexual tension totally unbefitting “that shrewd and knavish sprite.” Elsewhere in the play, Zoffer swaggered around the other characters, leering down at them; the transformation of Puck from a childish mischiefmaker into something more like a creepy voyeur (or voyeuse, as the case may be) was an off-putting one, but not enough to sour a production that was so strong overall. The spirited, energetic performances and clever set design and costuming won out, making for a production with far more staying power than any mere dream.

The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of  “The Drowsy Chaperone,” set to run April 25 to May 4, is a vaudeville extravaganza with a modernist flair. A show-within-a-show, the musical focuses on the ensuing escapades before the wedding of diva Janet van de Graaf (Tess V. Davison ’16)—all accompanied by commentary from the mysterious narrator Man in Chair (Andy J. Boyd ’14).
The musical’s set-up allows the cast and crew to create a fun but intelligent production. “It has a good mix of post-modern ‘knowingness’ and old musical fun,” Boyd says. Rather than shying away from the more escapist elements of slapstick comedy, the production aims to highlight the ridiculous aspects of this particular style of humor with a cynical tinge. Morgan E. Henry ’14, who plays the titular The Drowsy Chaperone, agrees that the format allows the audience to enjoy Golden Age musicals while remaining critical of its more saccharine tendencies. “It’s good for theater cynics and theater lovers,” she says.
Striking a balance between humor and introspection can be a challenge, especially for a script with heavy doses of unabashed absurdity. Director Allen J. MacLeod ’14 plans to maintain the script’s character by not straying too far from the material; though he says the Harvard production will be unique, this is more a result of the people who are involved rather than of any sweeping change to the narrative. “I’m trying to make [the production] very genuine both with the narrator’s perspective on things and the scene themselves, so you could see why [the show is] endearing to the [Man in Chair],” MacLeod says.
The show’s vibrancy is maintained in part through its large dance sequences and tap numbers. According to Davison, “The Drowsy Chaperone” is one of the few Harvard productions to focus so heavily on choreography that embraces the physicality and technique of the dancers, including one piece where Davison does splits and cartwheels.
With an appreciation of the hilarious source material, the cast and crew hope to produce a show that will leave the audience laughing and enjoying it as much as they themselves do. “[Sometimes] something catches me by surprise in rehearsal,  and I just laugh for a minute straight,” MacLeod says. “That’s when you know you have something special.”

When I was in seventh grade, I filled up pages and pages of notebook paper with teen angst—how misunderstood I was, the color of my crush’s eyes (green, for the record), and how I dreamed of being somewhere other than middle school. 
I still have them stacked in the attic back home—wide-ruled notebooks from Staples filled with poetry I scribbled down during math class. One particularly articulate and original line, “Because your eyes are green/like emerald seas/is there anyone as misunderstood/as me?” Art then was a refuge. I had no expectations of wowing readers. Rather, I wrote because I had something to say.
Now, I specialize in opinion writing, which has a very precise formula. Hook, thesis, point, point, call to action. Piece done. Too often, we pigeonhole ourselves into niches that we perceive ourselves as being good at. Especially at Harvard, where most people are tremendously skilled at something, it can be absolutely terrifying to try a craft you know you will be bad at. On a campus with myriad English majors and probably at least one future Nobel Laureate in Literature, one might think, where does my writing have a place at all?
I write very few bad poems nowadays—and I’m ashamed of it.
Over spring break, I rediscovered my boxes of poems, with their forced rhymes and overwrought sentiment. Back then, there didn’t exist a concept of identity or what the world would perceive my strengths and weaknesses to be. I didn’t have a niche in the world, much less a writing niche. I was free to be raw, to let my feelings spill out on paper in all their hyperbolic glory.
When it comes down to it, whether or not “Is there anyone as misunderstood/as me?” counts as good poetry is irrelevant. My seventh-grade self never intended for the poetry to be published by the New Yorker. I wasn’t writing because it was assigned, or because I felt the need to publicize anything. I was writing simply because I recognized the value of my own feelings and felt the need to express them.
As a teenager, every new emotion is a vivid and original experience that deserves to be documented. Happiness really does feel, in the words of my seventh-grade diary, “SO AMAZING!!!!!!!” Loneliness really does feel all-consuming. My words came in clichéd hyperbole because that style reflected how I perceived reality.
Somewhere in the process of growing up, we lose that certainty of the validity of our own feelings in their most naked, tumultuous glory. We’re more socially aware in our speech, restricted in our social media content (embarrassingly open Facebook statuses from middle school, anyone?), and wary in our writing. The confidence to write badly fades as we become more controlled and adult-like in our emotions. In exchange, we forfeit that exuberant ability to feel.
After all, who feels more alive than a teenage girl, writing in her journal by flashlight, penning hundreds of words about the five words her crush said to her that day? Bad writing summons the freedom to feel and to express those crushingly intense feelings. If you want to live life to the fullest, you have to allow yourself to express emotions to the fullest.
I think I might start writing bad poetry again. I might compare love to thunderstorms and whirlwinds, a certain someone’s eyes to the depthless ocean, the happiness I feel to dancing in the rain. I might even force a few rhymes. In writing badly, I’ll allow myself to feel every grain of life itself as intensely as it deserves to be felt.
We all know how to write. Some of us just don’t consider ourselves writers. Most of us feel like we’re not the best at writing, like our prose merits less praise because of grammar or word choice or syntax, or because the images we choose are too trite. But in reality, bad writing just means unfettered feeling and uninhibited living.
So let your writing be bad and mostly uninhibited. Let your life be joyful and mostly unlimited.

The world has been watching Ukraine over the past several months as the Eastern European nation has become a hotbed of international tensions. First came the overthrow of then-President Viktor F. Yanukovych after his approval of a $15 billion bailout from Russia, followed by a series of violent protests that eventually led to the shaky, not-so-complete interim government currently in control of Ukraine. Following these events, international forces began jockeying for influence in Ukraine’s future. The Western world has kept an eye on the country through extended NATO presence and reconnaissance, and the United States has very recently deployed troops to the country. Meanwhile, Russian forces line the Ukrainian border; Crimea has seceded from Ukraine and annexed itself to its behemoth neighbor (as Putin labels it, “New Russia”); and “Pro-Russia Forces” within Ukraine have turned out to be Russian Special Forces in poor disguise. The recent escalations in and around Ukraine are alarming, especially considering the growing international involvement. Yet no matter how many NATO or American troops are deployed, it’s important that the new Ukrainian government be one that represents its people’s ideals devoid of current foreign affairs.
According to Nataliya Bugayova, a 2012 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who now serves as both an advisor and chief of staff to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade in Ukraine, these ideals held by citizens are largely Western, as can be seen from much of Ukraine’s unrest with Russian intervention. In fact, the Harvard Club of Ukraine has been working with alumni organizations of other universities throughout the US and Europe to encourage Western-educated Ukrainians to apply to vacant positions within the new government.
We commend the efforts of the Harvard Club of Ukraine and the government’s role in professionalizing the Ukrainian bureaucracy, as it shows some of the country’s first steps in responding to the needs of its people rather than its politics. We certainly hope that such a trend will continue in the elections taking place in May, with citizens hoping for new faces. We also look forward to a new constitution for Ukraine, without Russian interference. Despite the unrest of the past several months and the loss of Crimea, Ukraine must form a government that is responsive to its people, lest it be overthrown again.
The recent efforts to improve Ukraine’s government reflect an important step toward normalization in the country. We support the Harvard Club of Ukraine and other actors who wish to professionalize government and tailor it to the needs of Ukraine’s citizens. That being said, lasting change will only come with a new constitution drafted for and by the people of Ukraine. With the recent conflicts stemming mainly from competing pressures from Europe and Russia, and with Russian and American troops massing at Ukraine’s borders, peace and security seem unlikely to come through international efforts. If any positive resolution is to be had, it must be at the hands of a self-governing Ukrainian people.

Nowadays it’s difficult to survive an undergraduate education in the humanities without coming across Walter Benjamin’s essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.” The Harvard University Press has released a new book on Benjamin, in case we are in danger of forgetting all those elevated, multisyllabic germanic thoughts we should be thinking when we look at, say, a coffee table art book or a poster of a painting by Klimt, Da Vinci, or Munch.
What is strange is that all this renewed focus upon mechanical reproduction, upon visual art, has not led to a wider-in-scope discussion of the even more radical effects of the electronic distribution and reproduction of images, texts, novels, and poetry. Thanks to products like Kindle, and features like Whispersync, almost any book can be delivered electronically—any work of literature you want, landing in the palm of your hand in seconds with a single mouse-click.
This new speed of distribution will affect literature. Literature will be returned to its disembodied origins in the oral culture superseded by papyrus, parchment, and printing presses. This transition from page to screen will bring changes both positive (such as innovation in form) and negative (disruption of economic modes of sustaining literature). So I would like to examine both sides of the debate—pointing out new ways writers can take advantage of the digital, and dissecting the various ways that publishers can weather these changes.
As I mentioned, when words leave behind the physical (book) and become electronic, they return to the incorporeal state in which literature was born, the world of storytelling, song singing and recitation of verses. The benefits in this case lean heavily toward poetry. Not only are most poems short enough to be read on screen without much eyestrain, but voice recordings of them can be shared alongside the text. Penn Sound and Harvard’s own Woodberry Poetry Room are leaders in the distribution of recorded poetry. Web-based literary journals like The Claudius App take even greater advantage of the digital space to transform the very ways in which readers interact with text, bringing to the fore the principle of random access as a challenge to the often linear accessibility of print on the page.
 Barriers to publication fall away, too. A quick search of Amazon’s kindle store will show a surfeit of self-published e-books on offer for, sometimes, under $2. Any writer is free to publish what he’s written by e-book, on a blog, or by tweeting installments. The Pulitzer Prize winning author Jennifer Egan published her story  “Black Box” as a series of tweets, and thereafter in The New Yorker. It’s clear, then, that these alternative modes of distribution are having a powerful effect, influencing the style and output of even those authors for whom traditional publishing is an option.
However, the consequence of this more egalitarian access to book production and distribution is that traditional publishing industries must now compete for readers, must contend with rivals whose costs are minimal: no ink, no paper, no advertisements, no overhead—just a cut of total sales given to website selling the e-book. An analysis of the differences between the e-book markets in the US and in the UK seems to confirm the common sense insight that greater competition among not only publishers but e-book distributers serves to deflate the average price of an e-book (in the US around $7, in the UK, around £1).
There have been some novel approaches to counteract the market forces that seem to bring the business of producing and selling books to a level of little to no profitability. An Italian reality TV show called “Masterpiece" takes the stance of the spectacle—it turns the process of bringing a book from draft to final product into the stuff of high (melo)drama. By televising a contest of novelists seeking publication, the publishers of the book can be assured of maximal exposure, the best kind of advertising, which is the ad that appears not to be an ad.
In more of a public-sector minded move, the Norwegian government purchases 1000 copies of each high quality new title; this guaranteed sale of books helps keep small publishers in a small country in business. Books also are exempted from the value-added tax, which helps to incentivize purchases. These strategies make sense for a small country seeking to preserve its literary culture (and distribute it all online through its national library).
Obviously such strategies are not ideal for the American market, or for the English language, which is in no danger of being eclipsed on the global stage. However, it’s important to consider how to engage with readers through television as Italy does; it’s important to value small publishers as Norway does. Perhaps the most successful strategy will be to double down on the book as an object. A final case to consider—that of Visual Editions, a publisher in London specializing in highly stylized and graphically beautiful volumes. We cannot, as of yet, electronically reproduce the beauty of books of such craftsmanship. It might be the best place to begin, to invest energy and creativity into the book as an object of artistry.

Early last week, Harvard University issued a cease and desist order to a local student startup, InstaNomz, informing them that they could no longer operate on campus. InstaNomz, founded by Akshar Bonu ’17 and Fanele S. Mashwama ’17, is a food delivery service catering to local restaurants that typically do not offer delivery.
Harvard gave the founders two options if they wanted to continue: Either operate as an outside vendor or be managed through Harvard Student Agencies, a non-profit organization run by Harvard students. If they became an outside vendor, they would could no longer offer delivery directly to a student’s dorm room and increase their operating expenses. Because this was not an option, the entrepreneurs attempted to negotiate with HSA but could not come to an agreement. With both options exhausted, the InstaNomz business has been suspended indefinitely. 
At first glance, the University’s position seems defensible. Having a business delivering food in and out of buildings could create security issues that Harvard does deserve the right to respond to as they see fit. Yet no one knows the actual reason behind the shutdown because the University gave no specific reason for the effectively forced closure.
The HSA performs business operations for students similar in scope to InstaNomz frequently. Some of these HSA services include delivering laundry, water and groceries right up to a student’s dorm room. Upon closer inspection, the dismissal of InstaNomz appears to be a case of the “Kremlin on the Charles” protecting its own state enterprise.
By its own description, HSA is the largest student-run company in the world. The organization serves an important role on campus by providing real jobs to Harvard students instead of a typical work-study program. But at the same time, this group has a monopoly on campus business due to their exclusive ability to operate delivery services within the student dormitories.
So what differentiates the HSA from InstaNomz? Not too much. Both ventures are student-run and serve the purpose of providing jobs and practical business experience for students. Maybe the reason for the special treatment is that HSA is a non-profit. According to the HSA website, the organization was originally created because hosting a for-profit company on campus would threaten Harvard’s real estate tax exemption. This defense does not hold up well however, because the majority of student businesses operating on campus are for-profit and based in either dorms or the startup space on Mt. Auburn Street (which is owned by the University).
If there is little that separates the HSA enough to justify its special treatment, then what could be the reason that allows the HSA to operate where others cannot? The answer may lie in the make up of its corporate board.
The HSA board contains numerous Harvard administrators. Consequently, there is a significant conflict of interest question regarding the board’s fairness in the treatment of InstaNomz. By having the school administrators on the board, HSA can effectively influence university policies to their benefit. The board has two key reasons to prohibit InstaNomz from being on campus. First, the startup has the potential to dominate a space that could be a large revenue stream for the HSA, and, second, if InstaNomz is allowed to continue, it would set a precedent allowing for other Harvard students to create companies to directly compete with the HSA and hurt its business. 
Ultimately, do the Harvard administrators on the board have a greater responsibility to Harvard Student Agencies as dictated by that organization charter or to the University itself and its students as required by their job? It is clear the board is choosing HSA over the market and independent efforts of others in the Harvard community by limiting its options and allowing this monopoly to continue. Harvard may try to divert blame from itself for the shutdown by forcing InstaNomz to negotiate with HSA, but HSA’s most-favored-nation status gives it all the incentive to not make a deal, knowing it can simply push aside the startup and enter the space.
Any person familiar with basic economics understands the dangers and problems of monopolies. With no other competition, market inefficiencies arise, resulting in worse outcomes for consumers. Furthermore, this regulation is not just limiting business operations but also preventing one from existing. In its current state, HSA is an inefficient, monopolistic organization that seems ripe for disruption.
If Harvard permits InstaNomz to operate, it is allowing for students to enjoy their favorite foods without the hassle of leaving their room. More importantly, it will set the standard for other Harvard students to create businesses that could compete with the HSA monopoly. Since competition breeds innovation, it will lead to greater efficiency and convenience along with better prices for Harvard students.
Despite the plethora of successful startups that have emerged from Harvard College, the entrepreneurial environment the university declares it has does not exist. The University cannot be allowed to continue to claim to foster entrepreneurial culture, then turn around and fight it. 
Although Harvard lacks a formal mission statement, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis once stated the goal of the College was, “to create knowledge, to open the minds of students to that knowledge, and to enable students to take best advantage of their educational opportunities.” In this instance, Harvard students and the InstaNomz founders have learned that the University allows for entrepreneurial openness only when it suits the administration, and, to evoke George Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” that some are simply more equal than others.

I.The Philosophy department considered making sections smaller this year.
II.If a philosophy student doesn’t talk in a 20 person class, does he still have a sense of self? No.
In this very special year-in-review edition of FM, we rounded up the 2013-’14 trends, events, and people that mattered (or didn’t). We picked the year’s five biggest winners of the school year. We’re sorry you didn’t make the list of biggest winners (unless you’re reading this, Evelynn Hammonds–what’s up?), but we promise you were #6. At least you weren’t one of our biggest losers (shout out to Shake Shack and the Harvard Ichthus).
If you’re more of a visual learner, we hope you enjoyed the year in photos. There were shots of the basketball team, the football team, the crew team, and also non–sports teams, too. They say a picture tells 1,000 words, so you just read more than 10,000. Now get back to your Social Studies 10 reading.
We also hope you enjoyed our more humorous content. We looked back on trends, compared the class of 2014 to the game 2048, compiled the best house e-mails of the year, and listed the alumni we wish had donated a building to Harvard (wouldn’t you want to live in Assman House?).
On a more serious note, we investigated the first generation student experience at Harvard, profiled Alan Dershowitz, who retired earlier this year, and rounded up the year’s best parties. There’s nothing more serious than a good time. Hope it was a good read!
Cheers to the three day weekend,Libby R. Coleman and Petey E. Menz
 
One day several weeks ago, as he was waiting to hear back from fellowship applications, Jesse G. Sanchez ’14 received a phone call from his hometown in City Heights, San Diego. It was his mother. “Jesse, something came in the mail for you,” she said in Spanish. “But I don’t know what it is—what’s Fulbright?”
Sanchez credits his mother, who was only able to attain a third-grade education before emigrating to the United States, with much of his success in life. But as a first-generation student at Harvard, he has struggled at times to reconcile home and school environments whose very vocabularies differ.
“It creates a sense of isolation wherever they are,” he says of first-generation students, particularly those who are among the only students from their community to have gone to college. When Sanchez returns home for vacation, it can be difficult to connect with or even find time to see old friends, many of whom have been working full-time since high school or have children and families to support. He finds it easier to relate to fellow alumni of Reality Changers, a non-profit that has provided academic support, financial assistance and leadership training to him and other potential first-generation college students.
Just getting to Harvard, of course, presents an even greater challenge to these students, who must navigate applications, fee waivers, and recommendation letters without help or experience from their parents, at high schools with usually overworked and often skeptical counselors. Over the past decade in particular, Harvard has made a concerted effort to ease this process, reaching out to prospective low-income and minority students (for whom there tends to be overlap with first-generation status) through initiatives like the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program.
But for many, the true challenges begin only with entrance through Widener Gate on the first day of freshman year. The past year has seen efforts by students and alumni alike to bridge a possible disconnect between administrative enthusiasm to attract first-generation students, and weaker support and outreach once they arrive on campus. For the students, part of this process has included the development of a “first-gen” identity as something to be embraced.
 
Freshman year can be overwhelming for many Harvard students. “When you first arrive, everyone’s lost,” says Nelida Garcia ’14, a cheerful, effervescent Chicago native and daughter of Mexican immigrants. “That experience of feeling a little bit out of it—it’s pretty universal.” But the transition to college is intensified for students who are the first in their family to enter college at all, much less one of the country’s most selective. For these students, figuring out how to approach a professor in class, or what to say to a professor in office hours, or even how to interact with peers whose experiences and families are vastly different from their own, is far from straightforward.
Garcia recalls talking with a classmate her freshman fall about their mutual struggles with Expos 20. The classmate confided that he had given one of his papers to his mother to look over. She was taken aback: “That’s something I never could think of doing.” The inability to rely on their parents for paper critiques or career support, for example, can be a major facet of the first-generation student experience. But the differences can also be more subtle. Non-first-gen students, according to Garcia, arrive at college equipped with a “toolkit” for interacting with others more confidently.
“They have this better ability to maneuver different areas,” she says, from office hours to faculty dinners, “because it’s more familiar to them.” Yet for many first-generation students, these social cues have to be learned on the ground. While their peers can often serve as a means of support for this process, other Harvard students—particularly in the early college years—can also cause further isolation. Daniel M. Lobo ’14 says that he was astounded, upon arriving at Harvard, by the sheer concentration of wealth on campus. He’d never been exposed to anything like it before.
“It was hard at the beginning just to figure out what to talk to people about,” he says. “Our experiences were—are—so different, and I didn’t really know how to reconcile those differences.” Eventually, he made friends who helped him navigate through the recruiting process, as he gradually realized that the only careers (rather than jobs) he had really learned about—medicine, from his family doctor, or education, from his high school teachers—were far from his only options.
Many students recognize that other resources do exist at Harvard for students overwhelmed with the academic and social requirements of Harvard undergraduate life. Lobo, for instance, turned to his freshman advisor, a counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel responsible for advising many first-gen students, for advice and support during his first year. PAFs, freshman proctors, and the Bureau of Study Counsel all provide counseling or workshops to ease the transition into Harvard, while HFAI publishes a 71-page booklet entitled Shoestring Strategies for Life @ Harvard directed towards students from lower-income backgrounds. But this year was the first that PAF training included a module specifically directed toward the needs of first-gen students. For some students, however, the availability of resources has not been matched by outreach alerting them to the existence of such resources.
“Harvard has a lot of institutional resources in place to support students as they transition to college,” says Sanchez. “But from my experience, there were very few people that could connect with my personal experience in terms of growing up below the US poverty line, growing up in areas where murder and drugs were pretty common.”
“[Existing resources] did provide a lot of support that I definitely benefited from,” he goes on, “but it was sometimes challenging to connect holistically and feel a real sense of empathy, in terms of having someone say, ‘I know what that’s like. I went through it, too.’”
Sometimes, even reaching out can be a challenge. “The problem was, I didn’t know what was appropriate to ask,” says Viet D. Tran ’16, who grew up in a largely immigrant community in Texas. “At home I took care of everything. I didn’t have my own problems—I had other people’s problems.”
He continues, “It’s this challenge of figuring out: What do I classify as a problem?”
In some ways, these challenges for first-generation students at Harvard have not changed significantly over the past several decades. When Kevin B. Jennings ’85 arrived on campus, he felt similarly isolated and alone. In addition, he bore the burden of what he considered to be a moral judgment. “When I was at Harvard there was a really deep sense of shame around being first-generation,” he says. “There was a sense that if your family was poor, it was somehow their fault.”
But what has changed, he thinks, is a growing sense of consciousness concerning first-generation identity. “The very term ‘first-generation’ didn’t even exist five years ago,” he says. Part of this growing self-consciousness has taken place thanks to Jennings’s own efforts. As a former member of the Alumni Association’s board of directors, Jennings was part of a working group which looked at the Office of Career Services. He realized that the confusion and uncertainty he had felt in searching for a career had not gone away for current first-gens. “The average first-generation student doesn’t have parents who work in investment banking or consulting, or any of those fields,” Jennings says. “The feeling of not understanding the universe of Harvard or understanding what I was supposed to do after Harvard—I was seeing those things occur again.”
His experience ultimately led to the creation, two years ago, of the First Generation Alumni Mentorship Program, which pairs incoming freshmen with first-generation alumni for mentorship and advising. Last year, according to Jennings, about 15 percent of the incoming class was first-generation; 130 students, or about 8 percent, applied to be paired with 103 alumni volunteers.
Jennings understands this program as one that fills a gap between Harvard’s outreach initiatives to prospective applicants, and provides support to students once they arrive at Harvard. HFAI and UMRP are both focused on attracting low-income, minority, and first-generation students to Harvard—not on supporting current students on campus. “I don’t think we have done everything we could to make sure people feel supported and included once they get here, and feel like they can succeed,” Jennings says.
Or, as Garcia puts it, “If you admit students that are highly qualified but who might not have a support system in place once they arrive, it puts them at a disadvantage from the start.”
A similar sentiment prompted the establishment of the Harvard College First Generation Student Union, which became an official student organization last fall. Lobo, who was inspired to start the organization after attending a panel with first-generation faculty members several years ago, sees the group as having several aspects to its mission. The first is to provide first-generation students—freshmen in particular—with certain resources, or to direct them to resources that already exist. “There’s an opportunity to reduce the amount of time it takes for first-gen students to transition,” he says. While many of Harvard’s resources can be fruitfully directed toward challenges facing first-gen students, these resources require proctors, academic advisers and PAFs to be aware of them and willing to communicate their importance. Lobo and others see the Student Union as filling in the gaps when such communication, for a variety of reasons, just doesn’t take place.
More generally, the group is also committed to building a sense of first-gen identity. While there is some overlap between first-gen students and ethnic or cultural groups on campus, the lack of any visual cues means that it’s more difficult for first-gen students to recognize and identify each other. For Jennings, who is openly gay, this process has some parallels with the process of “coming out,” of finding pride rather than shame in a kind of identity that is often not immediately evident.
“We want to build a community where people are advertising their identity with pride and connecting with others based on their identity,” says Lobo. “And feeling empowered about it.”
Finally, though, the group plans to advocate for more institutional commitment to supporting first-generation students; according to Lobo, “recognizing that a lot of our peer institutions have a lot more resources and programming.” When Lobo was accepted to Georgetown, for instance, he was also admitted into a program called Community Scholars, which brings first-gen students to campus about a month before the beginning of the semester. It includes skills-building workshops, such as panels on how to talk to professors, and strives to build a community for the students that take part. “Can we mimic this program?” asks Lobo. “It’s something we should at least be discussing.”
Others suggest room for improvement in the establishment of a first-generation student center, similar to the Women’s Center in the basement of Canaday. Currently, Garcia says, “people tend to stick to people who they feel are from similar backgrounds because there aren’t any spaces where they feel comfortable enough.” For Garcia, such a center would serve not to isolate the first-gen students from the broader community, but rather to provide both a space for empowerment and the opportunity to educate the student body about the first-gen experience. “I think it would benefit the entire community,” she says.
For Jennings, possible changes might also include developing more targeted, specific training to educate freshmen proctors on the first-gen experience, as well as ensuring that existing programs like OCS are “first-generation inclusive.”
Before starting to advocate more actively for first-generation issues, Lobo says that he thought no one on higher administrative levels was talking about the challenges facing students like him. “I realized quickly that I was wrong, that these conversations have been taking place,” he says. “There just hasn’t been much action.”
He continues, “That tells me that the administration realizes that there’s an opportunity for improvement with the first-gen experience here. But I think they’ve realized that the transition is not happening as quickly as it could.”
Programs like the First Generation Student Union and Alumni Mentorship Program will perhaps, then, provide a model for more sustained administrative changes. For Jennings, at least, the prospects are bright. “The 2013-2014 school year is going to go down,” he claims, “as the turning point for first-generation students at Harvard.”

“I don’t believe in retirement, I believe in changing careers,” former Harvard Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz tells me over the phone on his way to Logan Airport, where he will board a plane to Paris. He officially retired from the Law School this December, but he intends his retired life to be far from relaxing. “My retirement from Harvard reflects the fact that I’ve been doing this for 50 consecutive years and at age 75, I wanted to try something different,” he says. “My plans are to be even more active than I’ve ever been before.”
Dershowitz begins to tell me his life story, a speech that he’s clearly given countless times and has down perfectly. He speaks quickly and efficiently—this man has places to go. He is the classic self-made man: he grew up in Brooklyn, New York, with two working parents, neither of whom had gone to college. He was a terrible elementary and high school student, he says, with about a 68 percent average. “I made it to Brooklyn College by the skin of my teeth,” he recounts. His family would not have been able to afford tuition, but luckily, attending Brooklyn College was free at the time. Dershowitz improved his grades, earning straight A’s in college and then at Yale Law School. In 1964, at the age of 25, he began teaching at Harvard, soon becoming one of the youngest tenured professors at the Universisty. “And that’s all I’ve been doing,” he says. “I’ve had one job in my life—a professor at Harvard—and I’ve had it for 50 years.”
Clearly, teaching at Harvard is not all he has been doing. According to the biographical statement on his website, he has litigated 38 homicide cases and authored 30 fiction and non-fiction works. He has won over 100 court cases and lectured to over a million people across the globe.
I ask Dershowitz what he remembers about his first year teaching at Harvard Law School. “I remember every single student that I called on in my class,” he responds confidently. “I remember where they all sat.” In that year alone, he taught CNN commentator David Gergen, politician William Bennett, and American diplomat Stuart Eizenstat. He explains that a third of his students were older than he was. “I was scared out of my wits,” he claims, though it’s difficult to believe that this man, who practically beams  confidence, has ever felt nervous.
Regardless, Dershowitz managed to succeed. “At the end of the first year, I got the highest ranking of any teacher in terms of teaching,” he tells me, and then reiterates, “I was 25, and I got the highest teacher ranking. So I was very pleased.” Since that first year, Dershowitz has instructed over 10,000 students, including those in the freshman seminar he’s taught for about a decade. Dershowitz says he is considering returning to Harvard in future years to teach the seminar, entitled “Where Does Your Morality Come From?” once again.
As a professor with extensive time in the courtroom, Dershowitz says he has been able to “bring a lot of practical experience into the classroom.” He explains that this balance between the theoretical and the practical has been one of his biggest contributions to Harvard. “I think I’ve made the classroom more interesting by bringing in my practical experience,” he says, “and I’ve made myself a better lawyer by bringing my academic experience into the courtroom.”
Dershowitz also counts his contributions towards making it “easier for Jewish students to express their Jewish values and their support for Israel,” as one of his biggest accomplishments at the University. When he first came, he says, people called him the “first Jewish Jew at Harvard.” He would often quote Jewish sources in his class, was active in Jewish events on campus, and did not hold class on Jewish holidays. “I didn’t try to hide my identity,” Dershowitz said. When he was up for tenure, a colleague warned him that “I was wearing my Jewishness on my sleeve,” which would hurt his chances. Today, being Jewish at Harvard...is very different from what it was five decades ago, he says, as Harvard is “a much more accepting, tolerant place.”
Though times have changed, Dershowitz is still known at Harvard and beyond for stirring up controversy—he is a man completely unphased when others disagree with him. I ask himwhich of his views have been most criticized at Harvard, to which he responds that his most controversial beliefs are his  support for Israel and his claim that the Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions, BDS, movement against Israel, is “both immoral and also hurts the peace process.” He adds that students have often objected to views he has expressed, and he defends their right to do so.
“But look,” he states proudly, “I’m controversial all over the world.” He recently wrote a piece for The Australian opposing the Australian government’s ban on Holocaust denial. “I believe strongly in free speech,” he explains to me. “I believe that Nazis have a right to speak freely, anti-Israel people have the right to speak freely, the BDS people have the right to speak freely, and Holocaust deniers…. When they express their views, I want to be there to express my views.” As a result of his article, he says, the Jewish community in Australia has claimed that he is supporting Holocaust denial. Dershowitz does not seem to be too bothered by this. The approval of others does not sit high on his priority list.
“I’ve stuck to my principles over my years,” Dershowitz says. “Sometimes it’s hard to understand my principles. Sometimes even my mother doesn’t understand my principles. But I’m too old to change.”
Dershowitz says that his position on the political spectrum has not altered at all. He has always identified as strongly liberal, but he believes that the views of people around him have changed, specifically with regard to Israel, which he says used to be very much a liberal cause. Without any prompting on my end, he delves into his opinions on the matter, explaining that to him, this diminishing support from the left is “appalling.” He continues, “If you’re a liberal and a progressive, you should support the country in the world that has the best record on women’s rights, on environmental rights, on gay rights, and that’s Israel.”
Dershowitz himself is considering becoming an Israeli citizen in response to the BDS campaign. He wants to be able to say, “if you boycott an Israeli, you have to boycott me.” Just today, he tells me, he was invited to contribute an article to a British magazine, and he responded by saying “if you would not have invited an Israeli, then you can’t invite me.” He believes this is “an appropriate way of fighting back against the immorality of singling out Israel for a BDS campaign.”
I ask if there has ever been an instance where the free speech of Harvard students was restricted by the administration, and if he got involved. “I can tell you they tried, but I think I’ve made it impossible for them to do it,” he says. “I have been on the forefront of maintaining free speech and free academic speech at Harvard.”
When Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat died, a group of Palestinian students at Harvard asked Dershowitz if he would help them gain the right to raise the Palestinian flag in Harvard Yard. He agreed to represent the Palestinian students on grounds of his support for free speech, and they were able to raise the flag. However, Dershowitz simultaneously issued statements saying that “I didn’t support what they stood for in raising the flag, and that I thought [Arafat] was a horrible, horrible murderer,” he says. In this case, free speech allowed for both the Palestinian students’ tribute to Arafat, and for his response.
Dershowitz has also taken a stand against what he calls the discriminatory nature of final clubs at Harvard. “I myself have never belonged to and would never belong to a club that picks and chooses based on how cool you are,” he says, “so I myself don’t approve of final clubs.”
Now, after his “retirement” from Harvard, Dershowitz says, “I want to remain active as long as I can.” He boasts that he currently receives calls from political and business leaders all over the world, seeking his advice and consultation. He just finished representing the former president of Ukraine, and is now consulting on a case involving the former prime minister of Pakistan. He’s finishing up his next book, entitled “Abraham: The World’s First (But Certainly not Last) Jewish Lawyer.” It is a history of lawyers with a focus on Jewish lawyers. He is also working on an opera.
Dershowitz is about to board his plane, so we have to wrap up our conversation. I ask what he would tell his students if he could just give one piece of advice. “Truth is not an end result, it’s a process,” he says. “Don’t expect simple answers—we live in an extraordinarily complex world.”
As the construction of Leverett House comes to a close, there’s no better time to reflect on all the new buildings that have recently graced our campus. From Quincy’s Stone Hall to the Smith Campus Center, the 2013-’14 school year has seen the architectural philanthropy of alumni with, let’s be honest, pretty bland names. Here are some alumni we’d prefer to see christening a building sometime in the future.
Anders Blewett ’03: Believe it or not, our football team once had a kicker named “Blewett.” This former attorney and current Montana politician certainly has the funds to donate the money, so let’s hope he doesn’t blow it.
e. e. Cummings, Class of 1916: One of Harvard’s most famous literary alumni, Cummings would surely be delighted to see his name grace a building, if only its title were properly stylized.
Sandy R. Berger HLS ’71: President Clinton’s National Security Advisor seems like someone who’d thank his alma mater by donating a building. Additionally, “Sandy Berger” is probably a more accurate and descriptive name than “Annenberg.”
Gary W. Cobbledick HLS ’92: The Cobbledick Café? The Cobbledick Castle? The possibilities are endless.
John D. Johnson ’47: We chose the one who graduated in 1947, but, surprisingly enough, there have been 17 John Johnson’s affiliated with Harvard since the 1940s.
Horst E. Assman HBS ’77: Call us crazy, but “Assman Auditorium” has a nice ring to it.
Increase Mather, Class of 1656: Yeah, Mather House is already named after him, but they clearly picked the wrong part of his name. Increase House sounds way better, plus the Mather Lather could become the Increase Grease Feast.
Thomas Hard ’60 and Richard Harder HBS ’42: Either of these would work, though let’s hope the latter goes by “Richard” and not by “Dick.”
Christian Cocks ’96: We’re guessing this is what Harvard College Faith in Action used to be called before Radcliffe merged with Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A group of Harvard affiliates involved in the Boston sports scene, including Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, discussed their successes and failures in the sports community and offered ways to overcome adversity Wednesday afternoon during a panel discussion held at the Faculty Club.
Amaker was joined by Jon Dienstag ’05, who works as senior manager of concessions and merchandise operations for the Boston Red Sox, and Jessica Gelman ’97, a former Harvard basketball player who serves as vice president of customer marketing and strategy for the New England Patriots. Dienstag is a former Crimson sports editor.


Sponsored by the Office of Career Services, the Bureau of Study Counsel, and the Department of Athletics, the event was moderated by Harvard Bureau of Study Counsel Director Abigail Lipson.
After each panelist shared personal anecdotes of triumphs and obstacles throughout their careers in the sports world and in their personal lives, the speakers fielded questions from the audience, which included student-athletes and other members of the Harvard community.
All three panelists agreed that despite the difficulty of dealing with failure, negative experiences and rejections can help to make success more meaningful and fulfilling.
“It helps to have training in rejection,” Dienstag said. “It doesn’t bother you as much. It motivates you to prove them wrong and do better somewhere else.” Dienstag noted that he had unsuccessfully tried to walk on to the varsity golf team at Harvard, but that the rejection encouraged him to pursue other facets of athletics.
Gelman shared what she believed were some of the biggest lessons she was able to pick up from her time playing basketball at Harvard and how she applied those lessons to her professional career.
“The first [lesson] is confidence,” Gelman said. “Confidence in my own abilities and the ability to teach myself.... The second is resilience; there’s a lot of failure in sport but you can have a lot of impact and make things change. The third is the importance of the team.”
While the panel mostly focused on bouncing back from failure, speakers also talked about recovering from triumphs and the difficulty of dealing with high expectations.
Amaker spoke about how the men’s basketball team worked to manage high expectations this season, as players dealt with the media hype, which surrounded the squad.
“Our leadership was outstanding,” Amaker said. “They did a tremendous job of keeping our guys focused on not believing all the amazing things that people were saying about them. We stayed true to our identities, standards, and goals and that’s all we focused on.”
While many of the ideas shared by the panelists were immediately applicable to the contingent of varsity athletes in attendance, members of the audience believed that anyone at Harvard could learn from the presentation.
“It’s always tough to deal with failure, so learning to deal with and learn from it is really useful,” Chris Willis ’17 said.

UPDATED: April 24, 2014, at 12:28 p.m.
In an effort to critique Harvard’s race-based affirmative action policies, the legal defense fund Project on Fair Representation launched a site earlier this month seeking for a possible lawsuit students who claim they were not admitted to Harvard because of their race.
The site, entitled “Harvard Not Fair,” alleges that Harvard “continues to use an applicant’s race and ethnicity as an admission criterion” and that its policies are “neither fair nor legal,” a claim that the University has repeatedly said is untrue.
POFR also launched a similar site for students who applied to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a site for applicants to the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
 
Edward Blum, who serves as director of POFR where he helps provide clients with pro-bono law services to challenge race-based affirmative action policies, said that nearly all top colleges would have made “perfect targets” to challenge race as a criteria for admissions decisions, but he chose to focus partly on Harvard because of its large applicant pool.
“We are highly confident that during the course of a case in which admission records are examined, emails are examined, admissions officers are deposed, we will uncover a systematic program of limiting Asians to a specific a percentage year after year after year,” Blum said in an interview.
He added that he believes the majority of the applicants applying to Harvard are well qualified, but still thinks that Harvard may be using illegal, race-based quotas in its admissions process, particularly for students of Asian descent.
“We know that conceivably 80 to 90 percent of those applicants would compete very well at Harvard, and Harvard is going to have to reject qualified students,” Blum said.  But he added that being “rejected because of your race or ethnicity is a very different reason than maybe a lower SAT score or GPA, or number of community service hours, or a number of factors.”
While Blum, who recently helped provide legal representation for Abigail Fisher to challenge admissions policies for the University of Texas before the Supreme Court, did not provide a specific number for the students who had already signed up, he said that “dozens, and dozens, and dozens” have done so. The effort is not without precedent, as many other rejected applicants have tried to challenge the University on similar grounds in the past.
Despite repeated requests for comment, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid did not comment on the “Harvard Not Fair” initiative.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 asserted in March that Harvard does not use quotas in its admission process.
“Harvard College uses no quotas for the admission of Asian Americans or any other group,” Fitzsimmons wrote in an email. “Harvard does not place limits on excellence.  We continue to seek the nation’s and the world’s most promising students from all ethnic, cultural, and religious heritages, and we use our need-based financial aid program to ensure they can afford to attend.”
 According to Blum, once a student provides his or her contact information, POFR will get in touch with the individual to learn more about his or her application. The site says that POFR would cover all legal costs if a case were to be pursued. In addition, any contact between POFR and a student would remain confidential unless the individual gives permission to share his or her information.
Blum said that his team of attorneys includes many who possess statistical knowledge, but nobody with direct experience in college admissions.
Some admissions experts question Blum’s claim of an Asian American “quota” at Harvard.
“There are definitely not quotas,” said Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions and director of international admissions at the University of Virginia. “A quota is an exact number, and no school is ever going to have a quota because they know it is illegal. Now, they may have a goal, and a goal is not a quota. That is where you get into semantics.”
Muth added that while he considers it tangibly harder based on statistics for Asian American students to be admitted to top universities, he doubts that Blum’s choice to specifically focus on Harvard will be effective.
“Why would you want to target Harvard to begin with when you have nearly 40,000 people, virtually all of whom are tremendous students, and to say we can prove that this group has been discriminated against,” Muth said.
In 2011, the New York Times reported that demographic statistics for Harvard’s enrollment over nearly two decades may indicate an Asian “quota” in Harvard’s admissions policies.  According to the Times, 20.6 percent of Harvard’s undergraduate enrollment in 1993 identified themselves as Asian Americans, but has remained around 16.5 percent over most of the last decade. However, the number of college-age Asian Americans nearly doubled in that same time period.

Students and alumni will now be able to order and send their official transcripts electronically through a new online delivery service launched Monday by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office in an effort to maximize delivery efficiency, cut down on processing time, and simplify online applications.
The “e-Transcripts” service will allow students to order their transcript as they have in the past—through the Registrar’s website, which then directs students toward the FAS’s transcript agent, the National Student Clearinghouse. However, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke, students now have the option to send an official, signed transcript straight to the receiver's email instead of waiting for the Registrar’s Office to process and send a paper copy of their transcript.
Some of Harvard’s peer institutions, including Columbia and MIT, already support online delivery of official transcripts.
“Instead of our office processing it, printing it, and then mailing it, which could take days and days for the recipient to get it, they could get it the next day or something sooner than that, even potentially the same day,” Burke said.
Gregory A. Llacer, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, wrote in an email that his office “eagerly welcomes this news.” He noted that several major national scholarship programs, including the Rhodes, Fulbright, and Churchill scholarships require official transcripts, but expect them to be uploaded to their online application portals.
“The ironic problem is that we have seen all sorts of things happen to the manually scanned official transcripts—they get wrinkled and creased, and worse, the "void" watermark, which is revealed by scanning or copying, cannot be removed,” Llacer wrote. “An official, electronic transcript will completely eradicate these problems.”
Students also said e-Transcripts will ease the processes of applying to internships, jobs, and graduate schools.
“I think [e-Transcripts] are definitely a great idea because they help save a lot of paper and they increase the speed of the process,” said Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee. “Unless your recipient has processed your transcript, the entire admissions process will not go forward.” 
Rohan W. Goel ’15, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator, said that whenever he applies for summer jobs at pharmaceutical companies, he always worries whether or not his transcript will arrive on time.
“It’s been a  bit of a hassle in the past,” said Goel, a Crimson multimedia editor. “I think  [e-Transcripts] will help because it will, at least to some extent, make students feel like their transcript will get there in time, because email feels more instantaneous.”
Since his appointment in 2011, Burke said he has focused on prioritizing FAS’s online services. Last year, the Registrar’s Office made unofficial student transcripts available online for the first time, two years after the Undergraduate Council and Graduate Student Council had suggested the idea to Burke.
 Along with the development of e-Transcripts, the Registrar’s Office plans to launch a centralized Student Information System, which will allow students to submit study cards online, in 2015.
“This is definitely a theme,” Burke said. “Making our services more efficient.”

Arizona Senator John McCain outlined his foreign policy views at the JFK Jr. Forum Monday evening, focusing on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and offering an impassioned argument for why the United States should intervene in Syria.
Forum moderator Jill Dougherty, a foreign affairs correspondent for CNN, began the discussion by asking McCain to officially declare, on the record, that he would not be pursuing another presidential run in 2016 after his failed attempts in 2000 and 2008.
“I accept the verdict of the American people,” McCain, a Republican, said, reassuring the crowd that his days in pursuit of the Oval Office are over.
Dougherty—who now serves as a Shorenstein Center fellow studying the relationship between the Russian government and the media—continued the conversation by asking McCain to elaborate on his own opinions regarding the current Russia-Ukraine conflict.
McCain called the ongoing tension between the two countries “ludicrous,” declaring that the United States needs to come up with a course of action as soon as possible.
“If we understand Vladimir Putin and what his ambitions are and who he is, then I think we can adequately develop a response that could be effective,” he said.
McCain acknowledged that it might be necessary for the U.S. to intervene if Russia expands its power further.
“We are now in a situation where we have to contain Russia,” he said.
McCain additionally addressed the rise of China as a superpower, saying that he refused to believe that the Chinese government was “ready or eager to challenge the U.S. militarily.”
“They’re not as smart as we think they are,” he said.
The conversation quickly moved to the subject of whether or not the U.S. should intervene in Syria. In his response, McCain drew on personal anecdotes to offer an emotional appeal urging the U.S. to take action.
“If I sound emotional, I am emotional. I’m guilty,” he said. “When I see people whose lives have been destroyed, when I see the bodies of these children that have been gassed with chemical weapons, when I see all those things and I see us sit back [saying] we’re war weary, well I don’t buy it.”
“I pray that it’s not too late,” he added.
The event quickly switched to the question-and-answer segment, which ran over the alloted time because McCain wanted to continue conversing with audience members. The senator took a humorous and light tone, entertaining attendees with a series of quick retorts that included several jokes against his own Republican Party. 
He left to a standing ovation from all 750 audience members in attendance.

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross described the challenges facing humanitarian aid organizations in Syria during a discussion with Harvard Kennedy School professor Michael G. Ignatieff Wednesday evening at the Kennedy School.
Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns moderated the event, which was hosted by the Middle East Initiative Speaker Series, and asked about how the Red Cross copes with increasingly complex and volatile global conflicts, such as the one in Syria.


Ignatieff and ICRC President Peter Maurer agreed that it is necessary to create a humanitarian space before negotiating a ceasefire. According to the Overseas Development Institute, humanitarian spaces are areas where aid workers are guaranteed safety and access to populations in need.
Creating such spaces, however, has proved overwhelmingly difficult and unsuccessful, Ignatieff and Maurer said.
Maurer noted that “one of the biggest problems has been the politicization of humanitarianism, which we can see throughout Syria today where humanitarian law has been manipulated to achieve political goals.”
He said that moving forward, aid organizations need to make a distinct effort to create a humanitarian space in Syria without the influence of politics.
Maurer added that the people are often unresponsive on the ground due to the widely dispersed population in urban areas. The inability to create an effective dialogue with them has made the work of the Red Cross especially difficult in the area.
Ignatieff responded by saying that, “the challenge on the humanitarian side is that the Red Cross is brought into the area to bandage the wounded, but as a result of the failing of the diplomatic and military sides.”
They concluded the discussion by stating that it is critical to get international actors to put pressure on the conflicting parties in Syria and neighboring countries to create humanitarian space within Syria.
“I think no matter how interesting and intellectual and deep these conversations are, it always leaves you depressed,” Kennedy School student Colin Eide said after the discussion, pointing to what he called “the impudence of those actors who could choose to do something...but choose not to.”
Another attendee, Kristine Buesser, wondered why peace makers have not been more successful.
“How can it be that difficult to create enough pressure to get people around the table to create solutions?” she asked. “We are helping to keep people just barely alive, but that’s it, and that is a serious problem.”

Jon Imber, an artist who taught a figure drawing course at Harvard for over 25 years and whose abstract expressionist works gained critical success, died last Thursday due to complications from ALS. He was 63.
Colleagues remember Imber for his energy as an artist, his attentiveness as a teacher, and his determination to continue to paint despite his diagnosis.
From 1986 to 2012, Imber worked as an instructor at the Office for the Arts at Harvard, leading a weekly course at Currier House for members of the Harvard community.


OFA Director of Programs Cathleen D. McCormick, who hired Imber after taking one of his classes at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, characterized his studio as both rigorous and welcoming. She said that Imber would often incorporate art history into his teaching, along with a good sense of humor.
“[He was] very committed to his students, was inspired by his students,” she said, adding that he was fascinated by the work produced by his students at Harvard. “I always felt that we were lucky to have him here at Harvard, because he could be teaching anywhere, he could be teaching at any art school.”
Heddi Siebel, one of Imber’s former colleagues, began teaching the course at Currier House this semester, and said that his instruction touched on life as well as the arts.
“He taught me more than I would have ever thought about how to live bravely and die gracefully,” Siebel wrote in an email.
University President Drew G. Faust similarly praised Imber’s teaching in a letter to him this January, while he was on leave due to illness.
“You encouraged hundreds of students to challenge themselves in the Currier studio and elsewhere, bringing to your teaching the same dedication and rigor that is evident in your work,” Faust wrote in the letter, which was provided by McCormick. “The arts at Harvard are stronger for your steadfast effort.”
Imber’s impact extends beyond his students to the larger Currier House community, according to Currier House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper. She said that a range of Currier affiliates, from students to dining hall workers, took the course.
“He was in our senior common room, so he and his wife, Jill, and their son Gabe kind of grew up here,” Pepper said. “They became a part of the Currier House community.”
Pepper said that Imber enjoyed having long conversations with students in the House dining hall, and often brought his own art installations to Currier to give back to the community.
Imber’s colleagues said the artist insisted on continuing to teach and create even after his diagnosis.
“I can hear him now, ‘Yup just wanna keep working,’” Pepper said, adding that when his illness prevented him from using his hands, he continued painting by holding a paintbrush between his teeth.
Siebel wrote that the portraits Imber made while ill were “passionate” and “heart-stoppingly intimate.”
“Ironically [the paintings] are lively and full of movement—embodying the very mobility the ALS took away from him,” she wrote. 
A documentary about Imber’s response to ALS will be screened this Saturday at the Somerville Theatre. Imber’s work is currently on display at the Danforth Art Museum in an installation that will end with a memorial service on May 18.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Heddi Siebel's relationship with Imber. In fact, she was a colleague of Imber's at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A study released by the Harvard School of Public Health has confirmed a direct relationship between the amount of coffee a person drinks and a lowered risk for type 2 diabetes.
According to the study, those who increased their daily coffee consumption by more than one cup per day over a four-year period experienced an 11 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Those who decreased their consumption by more than a cup per day, on the other hand, increased their risk by 17 percent.
Researchers also collected the same data on tea consumption, but no correlation was found between the drink and the disease.
“I was really happy to see that the changes themselves were associated with risk,” said School of Public Health postdoctoral fellow Shilpa Bhupathiraju, the study's lead author. “Increasing coffee decreases the risk for type 2 diabetes, while decreasing it raises it.”
The researchers analyzed data on caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption for over 120,000 participants from three separate studies over the course of more than 20 years.  Participants were evaluated every four years with a questionnaire, with those who had type 2 diabetes filling out additional forms. A total of 7,269 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented.
Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes can often be treated with lifestyle adjustments such as diet and exercise. Patients with type 2 diabetes are still capable of producing insulin, though this it is ineffective in controlling blood glucose levels. Occasionally, oral medication may be taken to control blood glucose levels, and insulin injections are sometimes prescribed.
“These findings further demonstrate that, for most people, coffee may have health benefits,” School of Public Health professor Frank B. Hu said in a press release. “But coffee is only one of many factors that influence diabetes risk. More importantly, individuals should watch their weight and be physically active.”
According to the American Diabetes Association, there are over 25 million people living with some form of diabetes in the United States, with type 2 diabetes as the most common form of the disease. Additionally, 79 million people are categorized as pre-diabetic or having a very high chance of contracting the disease sometime during their lives.
The study will appear online Thursday in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.

To become Ivy League champions for the first time since 1990, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team will have to put the past behind it and defeat No. 13 Yale on Saturday in New Haven.
“We are very excited about this game,” co-captain Joe Petrucci said. “Obviously, Harvard-Yale is a huge rivalry, and we will be playing for an Ivy League championship. It’s something the senior class hasn’t done in their careers here, so it’s really exciting.”
The past seasons have witnessed even matchups between the Crimson (8-5, 4-1 Ivy) and the Bulldogs (9-3, 3-2). Yale came away from the 2013 contest with an 11-10 victory that clinched a spot in the Ancient Eight tournament, while Harvard ended the season empty-handed.
The New Haven squad ultimately went on to win the tournament last year and appear in the NCAA Tournament, where Yale advanced to second round play before eventually falling to Syracuse by one goal.
“If we win this game we…earn the right to host the Ivy League tournament,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We earned our spot into the tournament, and now we just need to lock up the championship.”
The Crimson remains undefeated at home, so appearing at Harvard Stadium in the tournament would undoubtedly give the Crimson an advantage.
But before focusing on their standing in the tournament, the players must first find a way to maneuver against a tough Yale team on the road.
“They’re a team that we don’t like, and they don’t like us,” Petrucci said. “It’s always a dogfight.”
This year, the Crimson will have to defeat noteworthy Bulldog attackmen and a formidable talent in faceoffs.
“[Yale’s faceoff man] Dylan Levings is as good as anyone out there,” Wojcik said. “He gets them the ball and allows them to control the pace and tone of a game.”
So far this season, Levings has posted a 59 percent overall faceoff percentage, a 65 percent conference percentage, and 82 ground ball pickups. Indeed, the 2013 Ivy League tournament MVP will be a worthy opponent for veteran Crimson faceoff man, senior Gabriel Mendola.
“Faceoff is one of the most important aspects of the game, but it is also one of the least predictable aspects of the game,” Wojcik said. “All I know is we have a great faceoff guy in Gabe Mendola, and they have a great faceoff guy in Dylan.”
Mendola has performed well this season, scrambling for 55 percent of faceoffs and earning an Ivy League Player of the Week award following his pickup of 20-of-26 faceoffs at the midline against the previously undefeated Cornell.
“Brandon Mangan and Conrad Overbeck are [also] outstanding [Yale] players,” Wojcik said. “We will really have to watch out for them.”
Mangan and Overbeck, with 39 and 43 points for the season, respectively, may pose a threat to the strong Crimson defense led by junior goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky.
“We don’t really game plan for any specific player,” Petrucci said. “We focus on playing our team defense better than they play their team offense.... They have a very talented offense and some skilled players, but we are going to work very hard in our preparation to take care of them.”
Gambitsky enters the weekend with 129 saves, with a crucial 10 stops coming last Saturday against Princeton to clinch the 9-8 victory against the Tigers.
Harvard’s junior longstick midfielder Brian Fischer and Yale’s Overbeck enter the matchup as Ivy League Players of the Week. Fischer anchored the Harvard defense against Princeton, keeping critical Tiger attackers silent in the week 10 matchup.
“We needed the victory against Princeton not just for the Ivy League title but also for our own mindsets,” Petrucci said. “The overtime loss against Penn was tough to shake off, but we were able to forget about it and play our best game against Princeton.”
Historically, the Bulldogs hold the series advantage over the Crimson, leading 60-33.
But this year’s Harvard team is unlike any Crimson squad within the past decade. For the first time in more than ten years, the squad enters the final game of the regular season with a winning record in both overall games and conference matchups.
“This year as opposed to years past, we have really been focusing on the details,” Petrucci said. “In practice and watching film, we are always focusing on the little things that can give us that edge. And in a one or two-goal game, those little things are what can make a difference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s volleyball team, the season comes down to this. The EIVA conference playoffs held at Penn State represent the culmination of the Crimson’s year and an opportunity to end what has thus far been a successful season on a positive note.
Harvard (15-7, 11-3 EIVA) will play its first round matchup on Thursday against longtime rival and conference foe Princeton. The two teams met twice in the regular season, and both matches went the full five sets. The Crimson emerged victorious both times, but this will be the first time the two programs have ever met in the playoffs.
For the seniors who have spent four years in close games with the Tigers, battling one more time against their biggest rival certainly adds something special. The fact that Harvard coach Brian Baise was himself a Princeton undergrad once upon a time makes the occasion even more exciting.
“I’m definitely excited to play Princeton in the first round,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “It’s been a very good four years of playing them. There have been some great battles, and as a senior class, it seems like a good way to end our careers.”
The Tigers’s primary strength lies in their high-flying offense. Behind only Penn State, Princeton has averaged 12.81 kills per set at a very credible efficiency of .306 in conference play this season. Three of Princeton’s hitters were named to All-EIVA teams this week, signifying the quality of the Tiger offense.
Junior Cody Kessel is the focal point of Princeton’s attack. The outside hitter has followed the same career path as Crimson offensive stalwart DJ White, with both coming into the league three years ago and both having made three consecutive All-EIVA first teams. Both Kessel and White rank in the top five hitters in the conference by kills per set.
Princeton senior Pat Schwagler has also had a large impact in the meetings with Harvard this season, while the Tiger defense kept White fairly silent considering his own high standards. Kessel and Schwagler had 30 and 38 kills, respectively, in the matchups this season compared to White’s 19.
Despite the Crimson’s victories in those games, Baise believes that keeping Kessel and Schwagler in check will be very important.
“Our defense is going to be key,” Baise said. “We need to slow down their two best players. For us to win, we have to keep their offense in check and hope that our offense does its job.”
The Harvard defense has certainly been up to the task this season, leading the league in digs with 11.02 per set in conference play. A large part of that load has been shouldered by co-captain libero Chris Gibbons. The senior’s 15 digs in the away game at Princeton was a large factor in the victory.
While every contest is uncertain, Harvard-Princeton matchups have consistently gone down to the wire. In the past four seasons alone, six meetings have gone to five sets. The stakes have never been greater than on Thursday.
“We’re definitely taking one game at a time,” Madden said. “We’re going to lay everything on the line to get past Princeton. It’s going to take some good serving, some good passing, and some aggressive defense to make some plays at the net.”
For the team that survives the first round, a meeting with Penn State likely awaits in the finals, unless George Mason pulls off an upset. The Nittany Lions have had an iron grip on the conference of late as they seek their sixteenth consecutive title. The No. 12 ranked team in the nation, Penn State dropped only one conference game against Princeton and will also have home court advantage.
The Nittany Lions beat Harvard twice in straight sets in the regular season, in games which were closer than the scoreboard suggested. The Crimson would no doubt love the opportunity for a bit of revenge.
“If we get to Penn State on Saturday, we have a pretty good shot,” Madden said. “They beat us twice, and we might have a little bit of a chip on our shoulder. We’re gonna take them down.”
Playoffs inspire the highest level of competition, and this weekend promises to bring out the teams’ best volleyball of the season. Harvard has never won the EIVA, and with such a strong senior class graduating, it may not have a better chance for a while.
“When we’re playing really well, our offense is really tough to stop,” Madden said. “We have weapons in the front and the back row at all times. When we’re passing well and we’re on the net, it’s real tough to stop us. If we get into the rhythm and we start gelling this weekend, it’s going to be a good weekend.”

It’s Thursday! In honor of Throwback Thursday, here are some songs from way back when (you know, when we thought Heelys were the “it” item and we all predicted who would grow up to be a good parent based on their Tamagotchi’s) to help get you to the weekend:
 The graduation song of all graduation songs: We all know that we had those moments where we cried listening to Friends Forever by Vitamin C during elementary or middle school graduation. Don’t deny it.
That Disney Channel theme song we all knew: The "That’s So Raven" theme song is definitely one of those songs we all hummed to as we watched it on TV. I mean, how can anyone not be intrigued by one of Raven’s psychic visions?
That song everyone jokingly quoted: "This Is Why I’m Hot" was honestly the start of every facetious joke about why people thought they were sarcastically “hot.” This was also the anthem of every awkward high school party (but I’m assuming we all erased these pre-teen memories from our minds).
And finally...a Harvard #tbt: The Harvard Baseball team’s cover of Call Me Maybe exploded all over the internet, and it reached that point where singing the song without doing the hand motions would be sacrilegious.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The good news is that there’ll be no rain today! It’ll be a sunny with a high of 58 degrees, but there will probably be some strong winds (PSA: don’t worry, you’re not the only one scared of bumping into the person walking in front of you).

 This week the nation was consumed by fears of teens applying Burt’s Bees lip balm to their eyelids to produce a tingling sensation. This risqué practice is know as "beezing". Flyby sat down with a major figure in the Harvard beez community to explore this trend. For his safety, Alec S. Bowman’s name has been redacted from this interview.
Flyby: What is “beezing?”
[Redacted]: Beezing is the application of high-level methanol [we think he meant menthol] chapstick to your eyelids. It produces a sensation unlike any other legal drug. 
Flyby: When did you beez for the first time?
[Redacted]: The first week of Harvard. My first time I beezed, I beezed with a true beez veteran. My first beez experience was like a lot of people’s first beez experience: first I felt incredulous, then I felt silly, then I felt pain, then I felt ecstasy.
Flyby: How often do you beez?
[Redacted]: I’d say about once a day. It depends on the week. Sometimes I’ll beez multiple times a day. Sometimes only a couple times a week. I got into a heavy wake-and-beez schedule when I discovered the enlivening effects of beez before class in the morning. Then I had to stop to take a tolerance break.
Flyby: Do you ever mix beez with other substances?
[Redacted]: Sometimes I’ll get “crossed” on beez and caffeine.
Flyby: Where do you beez?
[Redacted]: Honestly, one of the best places to beez is the open air because the chilly windst will augment the effects of beez. Longtime beez-ers refer to this as the “beez and freeze.” But the great thing about beez is you can always beez on the go.
Flyby: Is there anything you want to let your community know?
 [Redacted]: Don’t buy pomegranate beez. Never forget, you’re in it for the methanol [again, we really think he means menthol]. When you find that it doesn’t cut it anymore take the next step: try lower lid beezin’. Tip number three: have patience. Beezin’ effects people differently at different times. Celebrate that. Happy beezin’.

 Back in 2001, a web scandal rocked Harvard pre-frosh weekend when a hacker infiltrated the admissions website and left the following message: “Q vergonha, defaced by USDL, Harvard sux...” “Vergonha” is Portuguese for “shame,” but the admissions office really didn’t have much to be embarrassed about because it hadn’t yet decided to call prefrosh weekend “Visitas.”
 Contacts at the admissions office reported that the website was down for at least one day due to the hacker’s ominous message, although we can’t imagine the fallout was actually that huge. This was 2001, back when most Harvard-bound high schoolers only logged on when they wanted to ask SmarterChild why they didn’t have any real friends.
The admissions office claimed to have identified the hacker but declined to reveal his or her identity. We’re pretty sure it was Zuckerberg after he got the idea from the Winklevoss twins. Or maybe they figured it out by searching emails. Just kidding, the administration can’t do that.
