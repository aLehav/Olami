After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once again, how Harvard manages its money is a target of attention, and deservedly so. Just last week, we commented in favor of Harvard’s pledge not to reinvest in HEI Hotels, a company widely alleged to have engaged in labor rights violations. At the same time, several students have begun the Fair Harvard Fund movement, which aims to make responsible investment a priority at Harvard. The main goal of this movement, which counts former undergraduate council president Senan Ebrahim ’12 as one of its founders, is the creation of a social choice fund to manage a portion of Harvard University’s endowment. Ideally, donors to Harvard would have the option of having their gifts managed by this particular fund, which would follow strict social, environmental, and governance criteria.
By incorporating a social choice fund into the management of our university’s endowment, the Harvard Management Company would send a positive signal to donors, the campus community, and the public at large. In order for this to be accomplished, the Fair Harvard Fund must continue its welcome presence on campus and work to see its goals develop concretely. Many institutions such as Brown University already have comparable options for their donors, and the market performances of such socially responsible funds have in fact been generally aligned with those of more traditional investment tools. By establishing a social choice fund, Harvard would likely be able to expand its endowment by attracting new inflows while simultaneously promoting ethically oriented business.
There are several steps that the Fair Harvard Fund could take to see its immediate objectives carried forward. To begin with, the students behind the movement have issued a statement endorsing a future town hall meeting, where the Harvard community could discuss the guidelines for socially responsible investment at our university. Although the intention of promoting “direct democracy” with a town hall meeting is certainly appealing, we should all be wary of using such  an open forum to determine the specific investment criteria of the Fair Harvard Fund. The term “social responsibility” is vague to start with, and the proposals generated from this kind of event might only complicate attempts to come up with a workable and ethical set of principles to act on. Instead, let us suggest an alternative: the social choice fund could follow the strict guidelines already set forth by the Responsible Endowments Coalition. These include a commitment to investing in companies that do not abuse their workers, as well as particular attention to ventures that uphold environmental sustainability. By employing both negative screening—refraining from investing in companies that are judged harmful to society—and positive screening—an active effort to boost businesses that advance environmental or welfare causes—the social choice fund could become an effective vehicle for tangible change in the local and wider community.
One of the current goals of the Fair Harvard Fund is to persuade the HMC to take over the administration of its assets. We urge the HMC to consider this proposal seriously, since there can only be benefits for both sides of the potential partnership, not to mention all who wish to see social choice investing become a reality at Harvard. On the one hand, by handing over its resources to the HMC, the Fair Harvard Fund would benefit from the supervision of established industry professionals. On the other hand, the HMC would have the opportunity to promote worthy causes alongside its continued management of the endowment at large, and presumably attract new donors who prioritize socially responsible investing.
As of today, the Fair Harvard Fund continues to solicit donations from members of the university community. With the constructive potential of its vision, the movement surely has a bright future. With the recent experience of HEI to serve as a reminder, we should all push for a Harvard where fairness is not merely option and an interest, but a priority.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am writing this piece while headed to Philadelphia, sitting on a bus with a backpack full of homework that needs to get done in the next six hours. Everything, though, seems to distract me. I chalk this up to poor decisions, like sitting in the back of the bus. The area basks in the soft fragrance emanating from the restroom and the guy sitting in front of me seems to be watching either “Desperate Housewives” or a porno on his laptop. So, by default, I am not actually writing my essays or working on problem sets. I am too busy covering my eyes and pinching my nose. See no evil, smell no evil.
Instead of working, I am busy listening to a song called “Vamos a la Playa” and fantasizing about my upcoming summer while reading instructions on my computer about how to make a gigantic sand castle. Themed procrastination! They say procrastination is in fact a normal aspect of college work, and usually the most time-consuming part. At least that’s what someone posted on Facebook.
I am a mere novice when it comes to procrastination. The true masters of the trade have orchestrated a house-wide war to distract us all from upcoming deadlines and projects and essays and midterms and finals. Nearly every house on campus has now been drawn into a widening fray involving everything from dining hall staff to cockroaches. The conflict is sure to escalate over the next several days.
It all started when Currierites voted in a poll for Adams’ future mascot, and picked the acorn. Adams then declared war on Currier. This, of course, raises a serious question. Why on earth would Adams House have put an acorn as one of the mascot options? If the entire house is willing to go to war to prevent something from representing them, the survey organizers should have simply left the item off the form. An acorn! Ha! Even a tree is a better mascot. (I have to constantly remind myself that not all houses can have a mascot as awesome as a gorilla.)
Now I suppose there must be some Adams residents who actually voted for the acorn. An interesting piece of journalism would focus on this rare species of Adams dweller, and question their loyalty to the house in its foolhardy war to prevent the acorn from being its mascot. I will not write such an article. In fact, I have yet to meet even one of these acorn-loving people. This may be due to the fact that instead of participating in the war, I hopped on a bus and headed to Philly.
But back on campus, the Great Procrastination War of 2012 must be handled with delicacy on all sides. We must ensure the clash lasts through reading period without immediately fizzling out, like my Saturday nights, or peaking too soon, like other things. The student body demands distractions, and the cardinal rule of war-making is to give the people what they want. Are you not entertained?
I suggest starting a university-wide war, replete with nerf guns and Styrofoam shields. Imagine a cross between assassins and “Gladiator,” except ten times more epic and lasting until the end of the school year. The rules are simple: once shot, one must relinquish his or her weapon, unless attacked by friendly fire. Any reports of widespread cheating will result in the transgressing house losing access to its own dining hall. The house with the last surviving members, or dining hall access, wins. Once the game ends, all the houses will suddenly realize that the winner wins absolutely nothing, and a free-for-all will break out. It’ll be just like a snowball fight, except instead of snow we will be throwing around Adams residents.
War is spreading; even Henry Kissinger ’ 50 is involved in the conflict. The impending confrontation can be controlled, though, to a smaller scale than the Cold War. With the right guidelines in place, this conflict can be both extremely time-consuming and incredibly distracting. Unfortunately, my involvement will have to wait. I’m busy at the moment, procrastinating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, I went to Sunday at the Park with George at the Loeb Theater. It was an excellent show about the brilliant and obsessive artist George Seurat. But I noticed that although the audience was only around 50 percent white, the cast was about 90 percent white. Indeed, of the seven student shows I have attended at Harvard, only one has had more than one minority cast member—the freshman musical.
I had never been a big fan of theater until I got to Harvard and started attending wonderful student productions that made me think more deeply and profoundly about life. But being more invested has also made me more conscious of the racial dynamics. As a South Asian, it bothers me that there aren’t more people who look like me on the stage. Although theatre is universally meaningful, this skewed makeup of the performing corps makes it seem less so.
This situation is rooted in the audition process. The 104-year-old Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club holds auditions through Common Casting, a mechanism whereby potential actors and actresses can audition for many shows at once at the beginning of the year. Each director sees hundreds of students for each part, a system that lends itself to typecasting. If a director is casting for a family show, it can seem awkward to cast white parents and an Asian child or siblings of different races. Appearance is supposed to add to the reality of a theatrical production, not subtract from it, so it can be hard from a creative perspective to cast an Indian male as a 19th-century French painter.
Says director Kriti Lodha ’12, an inactive Crimson editor, who has acted in productions and directed Proof and Rabbit Hole, “I’ll be honest, I think my race, as a part of many different things about me, from my body type, to the way I dress, affects how I’m seen in Common Casting.” Jason J. Wong ’10, who directed The Laramie Project in 2009 and advocated for diversity in theater during his time at Harvard, said of Common Casting, “It might be a little primitive.” Lodha adds, “As a minority you have to be that much better in auditions because you’re not who people typically see in the part.”
A common retort when diversity in theatre is brought up is that minorities simply don’t audition as much. Margaret C. Kerr ’13, current president of the HRDC said, “It comes down to who auditions. It’s entirely their choice.” This is certainly true, but if a student gets turned away from Common Casting, it is often too easy for them to think—whether or not it is actually true—that racial factors came into consideration, and thus the “choice” to audition is more complex than a simple time calculus. Moreover, if you attend shows and never see someone who looks remotely like you, than what kind of message do you get about your potential to succeed? It can seem easier to get involved with the many performing arts opportunities offered by cultural groups on campus, opportunities that result in a separate-but-equal arts scene—one in which the old and historic is largely Caucasian and the new and experimental is largely not.
There are easy steps that could be taken to make this process better. First, the HRDC or Harvard Foundation should keep statistics on how many racial minorities audition for their shows, as this is a basic aspect of being race-conscious. Maybe the theater community has no diversity problem, but we cannot know because no one keeps track. Also, the HRDC should spam email lists about casting, which is a significant way in which other organizations make an effort to increase their diversity. Lastly, although these productions are theoretically colorblind, this is not written on the audition form. Students should be made aware of this and of what constitutes racial profiling in theatre so they understand their rights.
“To suggest that any person or particular group of people needs special consideration is insulting to their abilities and to the integrity of those constructing the casts,” wrote Benjamin K. Glaser ’09 in a 2009 Crimson op-ed on the subject. However, it’s also insulting to underestimate the role of race in America and the way it subconsciously affects the way we identify each other, the opportunities we’ve had, and our campus social networks.
In the end, theater fundamentally reflects social mores and beliefs. Its influence depends on the degree to which it reflects what we know, but it, itself, can  affect as well how we view society. That’s why meaningful diversity in performers, directors, and shows is so important. As Wong says, “Take Death of a Salesman. When you see someone different from the original vision it brings something new to the experience. If you can only see one group of people in these roles, you’re not living the potential of theater.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For students, navigating Harvard's decentralized waters can be a challenge. From reserving rooms to applying for organization grants to determining which administrator may be able to address your student group's concern, there seems to be a convoluted process and opaque leadership structure within each University body. Advocates, activists, and academics who seek solutions to pressing issues often find themselves expressing disjointed islands of voices that fail to reach the relevant bodies and affect change.
Simply put, Harvard is a complex place.
It is time to provide a forum for student voice on Harvard's campus and to bridge the gap between students and administrators. Through a number of initiatives that seek to address administrator accountability and better connect the Undergraduate Council to its constituents, we hope to institutionalize a means of communication and student voice on campus. In that endeavor, we ask for your involvement and support.
As per Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds’ recommendation, the College formed a Task Force on Student Voice this semester. Composed of students, faculty, and administrators, the task force seeks to investigate and address communications issues between these bodies.
As the committee problem-solves, we ask you to share your thoughts about the values that should guide student involvement in College matters via the dinner focus groups this week or the online comment box. Specifically, how can communication be improved among College administrators, faculty, student leaders, and students at large? What are the best ways for administrators to get student input on a variety of issues?
It is important for student leaders to understand the governance structures of Harvard College, FAS, and Harvard University in order to most effectively engage with our campus about student life issues. Rather than taking on an adversarial approach, we want to establish relationships between students and administrators in both formal and informal settings to facilitate effective communication.
Thanks to recently established bi-weekly/monthly Office of Student Life office hours, students can now drop into University Hall with their concerns without scheduling an appointment several weeks in advance.
As the first of our "Meet the Deans" luncheon series, the UC hosted a student-admin lunch this past week in Lowell Small Dining Room with Mike Smith, Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Dean of Freshman, Dean Joshua G. McIntosh, Dean Emelyn A. Dela Pena, and Dean David R. Friedrich of OSL. Twenty students, who signed up via the UC Weekly e-mail circulated to all of the House and Dorm lists and on the UC website, joined the Deans over an informal lunch that discussed everything from rejection at Harvard to the cheapest eats in the Square.
On April 27, Dean Hammonds and Jay L. Ellison, Secretary of the AdBoard, will participate in the second luncheon of our series, and we encourage students to sign up this week. By forging personal relationships between students and administrators in these informal settings, we may be better poised to achieve cooperative solutions to campus concerns.
In conjunction with our efforts to achieve effective communication between students and administrators, we realize that the UC must also address its own accountability to the student body. We have launched a number of initiatives to establish a culture of transparency and accessibility.
The UC recently published its first Annual Report that outlines its funding and advocacy work as well as current initiatives. A Mid-Year report, which will include recent advocacy initiatives like bringing coffee to FlyBy and making Lamont Library 24/7 during Reading Period, will be published in May. We hope these initiatives can better inform students of the UC’s current role and future goals.
The UC President and Vice President, hold bi-weekly office hours (times are found on the website and in the UC Weekly), typically in Lamont Cafe and most recently, in Cabot Cafe, to engage with student concerns and solicit feedback. Similarly, the UC Treasurer and Finance Committee Chair now hold weekly office hours to distribute checks and provide assistance in the grant application process.
Through UC Study Breaks, House and Yard UC reps chat with their constituents over food once a semester, and through our HoCo liaison program, reps stay updated on House Life by connecting with their HoCo members.
Finally, our UC Town Hall Initiative aims to bring students face-to-face with the issues they care about and give a voice to undergraduate concerns. The recent Responsible Investment Town Hall, which included panelists from Harvard Management Corporation and Harvard Business School, provided a necessary forum for discussion of Harvard's investment practices and brought an emerging student concern to the attention of the administration and the greater campus community.
Harvard, if you have complaints, please voice them. If you want to pursue an initiative on campus, let us know how we can help. Write an email to your UC representative with questions if you have them. Particularly impassioned? Speak to us in person. We sincerely believe that students should have a stronger, more unified, productive voice on campus, in communicating with each other and with the administration. This school can feel more like a distant institution than a place where we all live and study; students should be changing that, and we really want to help. Speak up, Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the three-man musical group Das Racist took the stage, overlooking the crowd of Harvard students gathered at YardFest in historic Tercentenary Theater, they offered a greeting that perhaps has not been yelled from the steps of Memorial Church before.
“What’s up, you drunk, overprivileged shits?”
Despite the sunny 70 degree weather, the concert—which featured The Nostalgics, 3LAU, and The Cataracs along with the brash members of Das Racist—was sparsely attended by students on Sunday.
Those who attended, many in bro tanks, soared on tire swings provided by the College Events Board, hit beach balls in the air, and hoisted each other on their shoulders.
“[Yardfest is] a great way to celebrate,” said Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck as she watched students from a distance. “We saw a few people pre-gaming, but that’s inevitable.”
Despite the festive atmosphere, many students complained about the performers at the annual spring concert.
“I think they could have gotten better-known artists,” said Kathleen Scout O’Beirne ’15, comparing YardFest unfavorably to spring concerts at other Ivy League schools such as Penn, where Tiesto and Passion Pit performed Friday.
Next weekend, T-Pain will headline at Yale’s Spring Fling, accompanied by Passion Pit and 3LAU.
Unsatisfied by their initial stereotyping of the Harvard audience, the members of Das Racist—Ashok “Dapwell” Kondabolu, Himanshu “Heems” K. Suri, and Victor “Kool A.D.” Vazquez—attempted to pump up the crowd by yelling, “All you white people make some noise.”
Freshmen who attended YardFest last year, when it fell during Visitas and reached an all-time-high attendance level, said they did not enjoy the concert as much this year.
“Last year people were raging,” O’Beirne said. “I would enjoy more dancing.”
Kimberly B. Johansson ’15 said that The Nostalgics, the student Motown band that opened the concert, was her favorite act. She said that she was not excited for the other bands because she was not familiar with their music.
Burton K. Mayer ’13, The Nostalgics’ drummer, said the band brought a different sound to this year’s “electro-heavy” artist line-up.
“We tried to pack in as much Motown as possible,” Mayer said.
Jackson F. Cashion ’13, another member of the band, added that he enjoyed playing for his peers.
“It was an incredible opportunity to perform for the entire student body at once,” Cashion said.
While listening to The Nostalgics, Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said he came to YardFest to support Cashion, who is also co-chair of Adams House Committee.
Although Palfrey did not stay very long, he said he stopped by to say hello to students.
“This is where our people are,” Palfrey said.
Some students said they were more enthusiastic about after-parties than the concert.
While students were still dancing to the music of The Cataracs, maintenance crews and College Events Board members began cleaning up Tercentenary Theater.
“We have to put the Yard back together for tomorrow,” said Anthony J. Pacillo, the senior manager of Harvard Yard and freshman dormitories.
Along with students headed toward the continuation of their fun evenings and clean-up crews with a mind on finishing the work, some performers seemed to be in a hurry to end the show as well.
But the band played on. “We’re going to keep playing,” a member of Das Racist said during the group’s set. “Contractual obligation.”

Panelists from across the University explored how language can both perpetuate gender inequality and act as a tool for feminist activism on Friday night.
The event, “Gendered Language,” which was sponsored by the International Women’s Rights Collective, featured a guest panel that featured anthropology professor Nicholas H. Harnkess; Lauren R. Eby, a graduate student in linguistics; and Maria Cristina Vlassidis, graduate student at the Divinity School. Panelists pointed out that some aspects of language are heavily gendered—which they argued can complicate feminists’ attempts to use language for social change.
To introduce audience members to this concept, panelists compared the gender politics of English, French, German, and Spanish pronouns.
They also noted that nouns are not inherently gendered in the English language.
Eby said that objects such as bridges, for example, can be referred to in both the masculine and the feminine in English.
“A bridge is masculine because it’s phallic and it’s feminine in that it brings people together,” Eby explained.
Students questioned the extent to which lexical choices affect the way in which men and women are viewed in a society and the possibility of reclaiming language in order to alter its meaning.
Both the undergraduate students and panelists also discussed gendered curse words.
Several students shared personal anecdotes about situations in which someone used language with derogatory connotations and, when confronted about using insensitive language, defended using the word by saying they did not intend to insult.
But Vlassidis said that intent doesn’t erase the history of those words.
“I question the person’s privilege or lack of awareness of that privilege,” she said.
Lynne S. Peskoe ’14, who helped moderate the event, pointed out imbalances in language, saying that words have been shaped by specific cultures in a way that encourages certain identities while dismissing others.
“You can’t use language to be anti-straight,” Peskoe said. “I can’t even think of a pejorative word for straight.”
“The reason that it’s more significant and more relevant and scary when it’s used against groups that are not in power is because they’re not in power,” she added. “The organization of power is inextricably tied to the organization of offense.”

From breastfeeding to undocumented workers, Harvard students tackled a wide range of subjects in five short documentary films showcased at Doc Festival 2012, the inaugural film festival hosted by the Harvard Law Documentary Studio on Saturday.
The films were created in the last year by students at the Law School, the Kennedy School, the Divinity School, and the College, with assistance from HLDOCS.
The festival was “a really well-deserved celebration of student work,” said Rebecca Richman Cohen, a documentary filmmaker and lecturer at the Law School who serves as a faculty adviser for HLDOCS. “Everyone involved in the organization, all the filmmakers, the board members, everyone who worked on a project, gave a whole lot of time and emotional investment,” she continued.
Five films were shown at the festival: “Naranjeros,” about undocumented citrus workers; “Staking Ground,” about a drag queen and a lesbian minister; “The Reservation,” about Native Americans of the Navajo Nation; “Transgression,” about a transgender woman’s harsh treatment in the U.S. immigration system; and “Milk,” about breastfeeding.
HLDOCS President and second year law student Victor D. Ban ’04 said that the festival was an opportunity for students to share their work with the broader community. “The festival itself is really meant as just a celebration of the student work that has come together over the last year,” he said.
But Ban also noted that the festival is not meant to be “the end of the process.” While it is “a great celebration, a recognition of [the filmmakers’] efforts for the year,” some of the filmmakers plan to expand on their work in the future. “[It is] certainly not the end and not necessarily the focus of what we’re doing,” Ban said.
Elizabeth B. Nguyen, a student at the Divinity School who is featured in “Staking Ground,” said that “in some way, being here together and watching it and then talking about it feels like the project continues.”
Ban founded HLDOCS last year after he discovered that he was not alone in his desire to pursue documentary filmmaking outside of the classroom. Though HLDOCS is based at the Law School, it welcomes members from across the University.
“There’s a demand for resources and support,” said Ban. According to Ban, the organization provides members with production equipment, a unique outlet for extracurricular documentary filmmaking, and improved access to potential documentary subjects.
Alexandra I. Gliga, a first year law student, said that HLDOCS has provided her with a place to screen raw footage, a forum for receiving feedback and critique, and “a community of people to talk to.”
Gliga said that she plans to expand her film, “Milk,” over the summer and will travel to Romania and London to shoot additional footage.
Though filmmaking may not appear to be directly related to legal studies, Cohen said that documentary filmmaking can benefit soon-to-be lawyers. By participating in some part of the filmmaking process, law students can develop skills that will help them manage new media campaigns and will give them a way “to tell a story through means other than...typing or print.”
The festival received support from Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz PC, a New York-based entertainment law firm.

A day after blowing out Yale in a double-header by a combined margin of 25-3, the Harvard softball team nearly repeated the feat Sunday, winning 15-1 in five innings before finishing the series sweep with a 9-2 victory in the afternoon in New Haven. The Crimson has now taken 10 straight from the Bulldogs going back to 2009.
HARVARD 9, YALE 2
Two singles and a double in the top of the first frame gave Harvard (24-10, 11-1) an early 2-0 lead and provided a statement that this game would not be too different than the three that preceded it.
Ten Crimson batters reached base in the contest, and co-captain Whitney Shaw led the team with three RBIs while freshman Adrienne Hume tallied her first two RBIs since March.
Yale (7-27, 1-11) looked poised to answer the Crimson’s first-inning rally as the Bulldogs started the game with a single and a sacrifice bunt, but sophomore Laura Riccardione would have none of it. She quickly ended the inning by eliciting a ground ball out before closing out the side with a strikeout.
In the fourth, Harvard tacked on two more runs. Hume brought freshman Alexandra Del Conte home on a double to left field before scoring herself on a double by senior Jane Alexander.
On the weekend, Hume scored five times after crossing tallying just three runs coming into the series.
“One thing our coach was really proud about was the fact that almost every single player got into the game,” co-captain Rachel Brown said. “It shows that our team has a tremendous amount of depth. We aren’t just strong one through nine or one through 10. We are strong one through 21.”
Up 4-0, Harvard continued to pile on in the fifth, this time with small ball. A walk, a single, an error, and a sac fly brought the first runner home, then another runner came across on a groundout, and a single scored the third runner of the inning, giving the Crimson a resounding 7-0 advantage.
An inning later, the lead was 9-0 thanks to a Shaw double that scored two. Yale finally broke up Harvard’s shutout bid by pinning two runs on freshman Gabrielle Ruiz, who came in to relieve Riccardione after the starter gave up two hits and a walk in five innings of action.
The Bulldogs’ first two runs came on a triple by senior Meg Johnson, who went 4-for-10 on the weekend. Yale was unable to muster any more offense, and a scoreless seventh sealed the weekend sweep.
HARVARD 15, YALE 1 (5 inn).
Coming into the weekend, junior Jessica Ferri had given up more hits as a pitcher this year (five) than she had accrued at the plate (four). That changed Saturday, as Ferri notched her second, third, and fourth RBI in the Harvard softball team’s first two games of a four-game series versus Yale. Things got even better for Ferri Sunday.
With the bases loaded in the fourth inning, Ferri came into the game as a pinch hitter.
The junior continued her hot streak with a homer to left field. The grand slam doubled her RBI total for the season and gave the Crimson a 13-0 lead in what ended up being a third straight blowout of the Bulldogs.
“[Ferri] has really been working hard the last couple weeks on her technique, and we’ve seen her come on with some good work in practice, so we were looking to get opportunities for her this weekend,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We knew she was strong enough to get it to the outfield, but the gram slam was great. We had a lot of people in the game this weekend, and everyone was stepping up to help the team win.”
The Harvard offense began Sunday how it ended Saturday, tallying six quick runs in the first frame. The damage could have been worse, but sophomore slugger Kasey Lange hit into a fielder’s choice with the bases loaded to end the inning.
Lange made up for the missed opportunity with a sac fly in the third to give the Crimson its seventh unanswered run of the game. In the following inning, Ferri’s grand slam headlined another six-run outburst.
In the bottom of the fourth frame, the Bulldogs got their first hit off Rachel Brown since the first inning on a double by Tori Balta. Balta then gave Yale its first score of the game when she came home on a wild pitch.
Harvard came right back in the fifth as Lange notched her second and third RBIs of the contest to give the Crimson a 15-1 advantage. Brown surrendered a walk but nothing more in the bottom of the frame to lock up the mercy-rule victory.

Last season, the Harvard softball team scored 19 runs to take down Yale, 8-0 and 11-1, in its doubleheader.
This season, the Crimson managed to top that, scoring a total of 26 runs in 11 innings to sweep the Bulldogs (7-27, 1-11 Ivy) in Saturday’s doubleheader at Dewitt Family Field in New Haven. After grabbing a 14-1 victory in the first game of the day, Harvard (24-10, 11-1 Ivy) kept the momentum going in the following contest and ultimately earned a second win, 11-2.
In Saturday’s wins, the Crimson combined for 26 runs and 30 hits, while the squad’s defense held Yale to only three runs and nine hits.
“Everybody on the team is contributing to the wins,” Alexander said. “The entire team knows that everyone’s working for these wins, and I think that’s why we’re able to have so much energy and do what we do.”
HARVARD 11, YALE 2 (6 inn.)
The Crimson ripped 14 hits while allowing just six to take the second game of the doubleheader, 11-2, in a game shortened by the mercy rule.
After a scoreless first, Harvard was the first team on the board, scoring three runs in the top of the second inning to take an early lead. Freshman second baseman Katherine Lantz and sophomore catcher Allison Scott hit back-to-back singles to lead off the inning. Co-captain first baseman Whitney Shaw then advanced on an error by the Yale infield, loading the bases for junior designated player Jessica Ferri.
Ferri kept the momentum going, singling in Lantz. Scott scored next as senior shortstop Jane Alexander reached on a fielder’s choice, and Shaw provided the final run of the inning, crossing home on sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson’s ground out.
Following another scoreless inning in the third, the Crimson put up four runs in the top of the fourth inning to extend its lead to 7-0.
Junior left fielder Ashley Heritage advanced on an error and scored on a single by Olson. Sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange followed that with a double, knocking in Alexander. Olson then scored on a wild pitch, and junior centerfielder Stephanie Regan singled to bring home Lange.
The Bulldogs responded in the bottom of the inning with two runs to make it 7-2. Neither squad put up runs in the fifth inning.
Harvard scored an additional four runs in the sixth to put Yale in a nine-run hole. Heritage singled and advanced on Alexander’s sacrifice bunt. Olson then singled to right field, and Lange singled in the next at-bat to bring in Olson and Heritage.
The rally continued as Lange scored on freshman second baseman Emily Gusse’s single to left field. The fourth run of the inning came in on a Whitney Shaw double to left center.
The Bulldogs were unable to muster up a run in the bottom of the inning, and the Crimson nabbed the victory, 11-2.
HARVARD 14, YALE 1 (5 inn.)
Four Harvard batters finished with two RBIs and senior hurler Rachel Brown fanned nine to lead the Crimson to a 14-1 victory in just five innings because of the mercy rule.
Harvard nabbed an early advantage in the first inning when Alexander smacked a triple and then crossed home on a Regan double.
Yale quickly answered with a run in the bottom of the inning, tying the score at 1-1.
But that was the last time that the Bulldogs came close to taking the lead, as the Crimson knocked in seven runs in the second inning to make it an 8-1 game.
“When they came back and scored in the first inning, it fired us up,” Brown said. “We didn’t want it to be close at all.”
Heritage roped an RBI single to load the bases for Alexander, who then walked to bring in Shaw. Olson followed that with an RBI single, and Lange singled to plate in two more. Olson then came home on Scott’s sacrifice fly, and Lange scored on an error to put Yale at a seven-run deficit.
In the third inning, Harvard put up one more run when a Regan single plated in Lange, bringing the score to 9-1.
The fourth inning featured a four-run Crimson rally, extending Harvard‘s advantage to 13 runs. Heritage smacked an RBI double and Alexander hit an RBI single to earn the first two runs of the rally. Ferri then homered to drive in the final two runs.
The Crimson plated in one additional run in the top of the fifth inning off of an RBI double by Heritage, who finished the game hitting 3-for-3 with three RBIs.
The Bulldogs failed to score in the bottom of the inning, and Harvard won, 14-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a midweek loss to crosstown rival Northeastern, the Harvard baseball team sought to rebound in a four-game stand against Ivy League cellar dweller Yale.
But the chance to pick up some much-needed wins got off to a bumpy start. The Crimson dropped its first contest against the Bulldogs, 3-2, before coming back strong in the nightcap to earn a split with a 7-6 win.
“We wanted to come in taking four [games over the Bulldogs], and the loss was pretty heartbreaking,” junior third baseman Kyle Larrow said. “But I’m proud of the team in general, especially the way we were able to hold Yale off in the second game.”
HARVARD 7, YALE 6
Down 7-2 in the sixth inning of Saturday’s second game, Yale (8-26-1, 2-10 Ivy) scored four runs on five hits in the frame to put the game back within one. But the Crimson (8-25, 4-8) was able to hold off the rally, due largely in part to pitching from senior reliever Conner Hulse.
Hulse earned the save for the Crimson, striking out four of the 10 batters he faced and holding the Bulldogs hitless in the final 2.2 innings of the nightcap, as Harvard escaped with a 7-6 win.
“I think we knew we didn’t play to our potential in the first game,” Larrow said. “We came into the second game trying to come out hard and match the intensity from the previous game. In a nine-inning game, there’s a lot more time to get runs on the board.”
Freshman hurler Tanner Anderson picked up the victory on the mound—and improved to 2-2 this season—after giving up six hits and as many runs in a solid 5.1 inning performance.
On the offensive side of things, sophomore left fielder Jack Colton led the way, driving in three runners on two hits in his five at-bats.
“We were seeing the ball better and getting timely hits,” Larrow said. “When you score seven runs, it helps you out a lot more than two runs do.”
Harvard got on the board first, as two errors and a Colton bunt allowed freshman centerfielder Mike Martin to reach home in the first inning. Sophomore second baseman Jake McGuiggan then drove in Colton with a single to left field.
But Yale struck back, evening the score in the bottom of the first, as center fielder Charlie Neil—who earned four RBIs in Saturday’s nightcap—drove home two Bulldog runners with a single down the left-field line.
The Crimson picked up five more runs in the next four innings. Colton singled to drive in junior first baseman Rob Wineski after the junior made it to second base on a sacrifice bunt by Martin in the second inning.
Colton picked up a two-RBI double in the forth, sending home Wineski and Larrow.
In the fifth inning, sophomore right fielder Carlton Bailey and Larrow closed out scoring for the Crimson, driving in one runner each to give Harvard a five-run advantage.
YALE 3, HARVARD 2 (8 inn.)
After Harvard went down quickly in the top of the eighth, Yale right fielder Joe Lubanski came up big for the Bulldogs, leading off the Yale half of the inning with a triple.
Junior pitcher Zack Olson intentionally walked the next two batters. But a sacrifice fly out on the subsequent at-bat from Yale second baseman Jacob Hunter proved to be the difference-maker, allowing Lubanski to reach home and secure the Bulldogs’ first conference win of the season, 3-2.
“Yale put together a nice little rally and were able to come away with the win,” McGuiggan said. “We lost, but it wasn’t one of those losses where you can blame it on one play or one player. Yale just put together a couple of good innings.”
Harvard took its lone lead of the game in the seventh when senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds scored on a sacrifice fly from freshman catcher Ethan Ferreira. But the Bulldogs returned fire in the bottom of the frame, with Neil driving in Hunter to tie up the game at two runs apiece and to send the contest into extra innings.
“It’s definitely tough being away and knowing that Yale has that last at-bat,” McGuiggan said. “No matter what Yale always has the final say. It puts you on edge because you don’t want to be the guy that makes a big mistake. That said, I think we approached [the extra inning] loosely and trusted in our abilities.”
Yale started off scoring with senior southpaw Brent Suter on the mound in the first inning, as first baseman Kevin Fortunato drove in Hunter with a single.
The Crimson loaded the bases in the third, fourth, and sixth innings, but was only able to come away with one run, stranding a total 12 runners on base in the first game of the day.
Harvard tied up the game, 1-1, in the fourth inning, with McGuiggan reaching home on an at-bat from senior catcher John Smart.
“That first loss was a tough one to swallow,” McGuiggan said. “But we did our best not to let it ruin the whole day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After mixed results at the Class of 1975 Cup at Princeton, N.J., on April 7, the No. 12 Radcliffe heavyweights returned to their winning ways against Ancient Eight rival Dartmouth and Syracuse this Saturday.
For the day, the Black and White (7-3) completed a sweep against the weekend challengers with wins in all five of its race on the Charles River.
In addition to four victories over the Big Green and the Orange, the Crimson third varsity eight, split into two groups of fours—varsity fours C and D—topped Northeastern.
In its marquee matchup, the 1V race, Radcliffe (5-1) held off the Big Green to recapture the O’Leary Cup after a two-year drought and return it into the hands of the trophy’s namesake—Radcliffe coach Liz O’Leary.
“This weekend, we feel like we really got to show the Ivy league what we are made out of,” senior Liz Soutter said. “We’ve definitely had a couple of bad races in the past couple of weeks. We’ve had a couple of challenging races with challenging conditions, but today we all executed really well across the board.”
In the 1V race, the heavyweights’ first of the day, all three crews launched off well from the starting line, with the Black and White 1V holding a small one-seat lead.
As the race approached the 500-meter mark and the crews settled down to their base rate strokes, Radcliffe had extended its advantage to a half length while the Big Green and the Orange (5-7) remained locked in a fierce battle for second.
In the final 500 meters of the race, Dartmouth had firmly established a lead over Syracuse and looked to threaten the Black and White for the lead.
But as the race wound down to the final 250 meters of the race and all crews began their sprint to the finish line, Radcliffe was able to counter the Big Green’s strong final sprint to finish first with a time of 6:56.8.
Dartmouth came in 1.6 seconds behind the Black and White with a time of 6:58.2, while the Orange finished in 7.01.1.
“I think the race, at least for the 1V, was an ideal race for us,” Soutter said. “Every part of the race went according to plan.”
“With every race, even one like this one, you will still have a bad stroke here and there,” Soutter continued. “But the most important thing about bad strokes is how you recover from them, and I think that we were able to blend well with one another and respond to every call that our coxswain made.”
Radcliffe’s 1.6-second margin of victory over the Big Green and Syracuse was ultimately its smallest of the day.
In its four later races, Black and White crews dominated right off the starting line and cruised to the finish line with resounding victories. In the second varsity race, the Radcliffe 2V started the race with a lead and never looked back, finishing the course with a time of 7.12.3, nearly 16 seconds ahead of second place finishers Dartmouth.
The varsity four A also bested its competition with a 13.4-second win, finishing in 7.57.9, while the varsity four B came in 7.1 seconds ahead of its Dartmouth counterparts in 8.15.5.
In its final race of the day, the Black and White faced off against local rival Northeastern. Though the Radcliffe third varsity eight was split into varsity fours C and D, Northeastern was no match.
The two boats quickly pulled away from the Huskies: The varsity four C came in first at 8:31.5, followed by the varsity four D eight seconds later, and Northeastern finished in third with a time of 8:47.0.
In addition to recapturing the O’Leary Cup, Saturday’s race had some additional significance for several members of the Radcliffe heavyweight program. For seniors, Jill Carlson, an inactive Crimson business editor, Anne Carroll Ingersoll, Meg Kehan, Christina McClintock, also a Crimson sports editor, Liz Soutter, and Kirsten Van Fossen, this past weekend’s race was their last time out on the Charles with the Black and White.
“Today was a really emotional day for us all,” Soutter said.
After taking on Dartmouth, Syracuse, and Northeastern this past weekend, the Black and White will travel to Yale for the Case Cup.
In last year’s race, Radcliffe knocked off the then-defending NCAA varsity champions Bulldogs and captured its first Case Cup victory after an eight-year drought.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 15 Harvard men’s volleyball team will go into the EIVA playoffs in two weeks riding the momentum of a win, but the team’s final weekend of the regular season was far from its best, as the Crimson split its New   Jersey roadtrip to NJIT and Rutgers-Newark.
Coming off of its first American Volleyball Coaches Association ranking in program history, Harvard dropped its first matchup on Friday night, 3-1, against the Highlanders, whose serving and hitting proved stronger than the Crimson’s.
But the squad recovered on Saturday night, taking down the Scarlet Raiders, 3-1, behind a strong defensive performance.
With a week and a half of preparation before the EIVA semifinals, junior setter Rob Lothman believes the team can work in some of the lessons from the weekend in its preparation.
“We can practice picking each other up and making sure everyone is focused for every point,” the junior said. “And I think that will make a big difference moving forward.”
HARVARD 3, RUTGERS-NEWARK 1
Coming off its disappointing loss the night before, Harvard (18-5, 10-4 EIVA) came into Newark on Saturday knowing it was the heavy favorite but remembering the lessons from the night before.
“Coach [Brian Baise] did a good job of reminding us that sometimes [losses] like [Friday] happen, but what we have to do is control what we can control,” co-captain Matt Jones said.
And behind a kill from Jones, who finished with a team-high 18 kills on the day, and two attack errors by Rutgers-Newark (10-14, 2-11 EIVA), the Crimson earned the quick 3-0 lead in the first set.
Jones provided five of his team-high 18 kills during the first game.
Ahead by one at 20-19, the Crimson committed three consecutive attack errors to give Rutgers-Newark a key two-point cushion late in the match.
Outside hitters Nick Madden and DJ White were able to level the score at 22, and the teams traded until 25, when two attack errors from the Scarlet Raiders gave Harvard a 27-25 first set victory.
Rutgers-Newark fought back in the second set, and a four-point run gave the Scarlet Raiders as 9-5 lead early on.
But the Crimson answered back with runs of its own, and soon the visitors found themselves in the driving seat once again. Riding a .500 hitting percentage in the game and more errors from Rutgers-Newark, Harvard eased to a 25-19 win, taking a 2-0 advantage in the match.
Errors plagued the Scarlet Raiders throughout. The team managed a hitting percentage under .090 for three games during the match. The Crimson blocking was also up to the task, as Jones and sophomore middle hitter Michael Owen each registered 10 blocks apiece for the match.
In the third set, Harvard began an early run to take a 10-5 lead. But the Scarlet Raiders fought back and responded with lengthy runs of their own.
Tied at 20, Rutgers-Newark began a 4-0 run, fueled by a service ace and two Crimson attack errors, and the Scarlet Raiders continued to a 25-21 victory to get a foothold back into the match.
The Crimson rebounded in the fourth set, as more errors from Rutgers-Newark and three late blocks from sophomore middle hitter Will Chambers propelled Harvard to the 3-1 victory, 25-18.
NJIT 3, HARVARD 1
After the Crimson’s decisive 3-0 victory against NJIT (11-16, 5-7) two weekends before at home, Harvard expected to take care of business against the Highlanders Friday night on its home court.
But early on, NJIT showed it had forgotten the results of the past. Despite seven kills in the first frame from Jones, the Highlanders made a late charge and took the first set, 25-21.
The second set proved to be tight, as no team ever established a lead of more than three.
Trading points all the way to overtime, Harvard had the advantage at 27-26 over NJIT. But the Highlanders were able to string together a 3-0 run to take the key set and a 2-0 lead.
And though the Crimson got one back, 25-23, the Highlanders outhit Harvard in the fourth set and were able to take the match with a 25-22 victory.
“We just didn’t finish when we needed to,” Jones said. “In a close match like that, it’s just only a few points here and there and usually we take care of those. But on that night we didn’t.”
But for Jones, the match served as a good motivator for more hard work before the EIVA playoffs.
“We have to stay hungry and play sharp all the time, and we didn’t come to play sharp,” Jones said. “It was a good reminder that we really need to work hard in the next 10 days to get ready for the playoffs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second doubleheader in as many days, the Harvard baseball team split its road matchups with Yale, claiming the first, 4-3, before falling in the second, 5-3.
“I thought the whole weekend was just up and down. There was good pitching on all sides, and it was really a great classic Harvard-Yale series in my estimation,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “Well played by both teams. But we were hoping to take three out of four this weekend, so I think we were a little disappointed to lose some close games.”
“We played well both games [on Sunday]. They just outplayed us the second game,” sophomore pitcher Baron Davis added. “We got lucky on the first one too.”
This weekend’s games moved the Crimson to 8-25 overall and 4-8 in the Ivy League. With eight conference games left, Harvard is currently tied for second in the Red Rolfe division.
YALE 5, HARVARD 3
In the fourth and final game of the weekend in New Haven, Conn., Yale (8-26-1, 2-10 Ivy) rode a late-game surge to get past Harvard and split the series. Back-to-back doubles off senior relief pitcher Marcus Way in the bottom of the eighth proved to be the difference, as the Bulldogs scored the last three runs of the game.
“Marcus was pitching with a pulled hamstring,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “He just wasn’t himself, and he didn’t have the velocity to push off.  It was probably a mistake on my part putting him in.”
Way took over for junior starter Joey Novak after Novak pitched seven innings, striking out six and giving up two earned runs. Way only managed one out, after Bulldogs Jacob Hunter and Kevin Fortunato started the inning with successive two-baggers. Fortunato scored on a sacrifice bunt after a throwing error advanced him to third.
“The difference in the game was our ability to bunt the ball,” Walsh said. “Offensively and defensively, our bunting game has a lot to be desired, and that’s disappointing to see. With these new bats, college baseball has changed. You need to be able to bunt the ball and really move runners forward. We need to work on that.”
The game started with a two-run first inning for a Yale offense that managed 11 hits, compared to just three in the first game of the double-header.
On the offensive side for the Crimson, the infield provided most of the pop. Senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds drove in two runners on a triple in the third, while sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan and junior third baseman Kyle Larrow both went 2-for-4 from the plate.
Bulldogs relief pitcher Eric Shultz captured the win, moving his record to 4-1. The loss ended Harvard’s chance at winning its first weekend series of the season.
HARVARD 4, YALE 3 (8 inn.)
A dominant pitching performance from Davis and junior Andrew Ferreira gave Harvard the victory in the first game on Sunday.  After freshman starter Matt Timoney gave up three runs in the opening frame, Davis and then Ferreira pitched shutout ball the rest of the way as the Crimson won in eight innings.
“I didn’t have my stuff.... I was kind of stiff,” Davis said. “My teammates, especially Jake [McGuiggan], picked me up pretty well, making plays behind me.”
Ferreira got the victory, retiring eight of the nine batters he faced and giving up only one hit to go with his three strikeouts. Davis also contributed 4.2 innings in relief. The defense surrendered no errors.
“Ferreira came in and did an outstanding job in relief,” Walsh said. “We had a limited roster for this away trip, but we got some really solid relief pitching.”
Offensively, a three-run top of the sixth inning brought Harvard even before the Crimson pulled ahead in the eighth. Reynolds and Larrow started off the inning with back-to-back singles, and after Way reached first on a fielder’s choice, sophomore first baseman Steve Dill knocked a triple to left to put Harvard on the board. Dill later scored in the inning on a passed ball.
Reynolds rounded out the scoring in the eighth, advancing to second on a wild pitch before scoring on an error by Hunter.
“We got a little fortunate,” Walsh said. “The ball just got underneath the second baseman’s glove, and Reynolds was running hard the whole way.”
Reynolds went 2-for-4 from the plate, moving his batting average to .297. The two runs gave him 15 on the season, good for second on the team.
“Reynolds was swinging a pretty good bat,” Walsh said. “With these close games, you really appreciate all the runs you can get.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only two strokes off the lead entering the final round on Sunday morning, the Harvard men’s golf team had a chance to break Yale’s two-year winning streak at the Princeton Invitational.
The Bulldogs had won in 2011 by six strokes, while in 2010 they defeated the Crimson in a tiebreaker.
But Harvard could not overcome a strong final round by Yale, who shot a 283, the low round of the tournament, and finished in fifth place overall with an 17-over 869 at the par-71 Springdale Golf Club in Princeton, N.J, this past weekend.
“The first day we played pretty well,” sophomore Theo Lederhausen said. “[But Sunday] didn’t go as well as we would have liked. It was a good start to the season, and we’ll go from there and get better.”
Ahead of Harvard were the winning Bulldogs at +6, followed by Georgetown, Columbia, and Princeton.
Dartmouth’s Peter Williamson was the individual leader for the tournament, shooting -5 in the three-day tournament.
The tournament was fairly close all weekend, with the top seven teams within seven strokes after Saturday’s opening two rounds and the top three teams within two strokes at the end of Sunday’s round three.
Senior Tony Grillo was the leading scorer for the Crimson, tying for sixth place overall at even par.
After the first day, Harvard found itself in fourth place with overall 577 strokes, two off the score of 575 for the leading Hoyas and Yale.
Grillo had an impressive showing, finishing his two rounds on the day at -4.
He was the overall leader on the day, and his first-round 67 was the low on the first day of the tournament.
Although just playing individually, sophomore Kevin McCarthy was the second best scorer for the Crimson on day one. He finished tied for 11th at +2 with a hole in one.
Though his total did not count for Harvard’s overall score, McCarthy was still tested and proved his ability all weekend.
“It would have been very nice to have Kevin in the lineup this week,” Grillo said. “But having said that, even as an individual, he had a lot of pressure on him this week having to post a score each round in a competitive environment, so what we can take from that is to know that he can do it and use that for the tournaments to come.”
Following Grillo through two rounds was senior Mark Pollak (+4), Lederhausen (+5), and sophomore Michael Lai (+6) tying them for 18th, 20th, and 28th, respectively.
Rounding out the day for the Crimson was freshman Akash Mirchandani at +9, good for 37th place.
Sunday was not as strong for Harvard, as the Crimson fell to fifth place and 11 strokes off the lead with a score of 292.
“We were right there,” Lederhausen said. “Tony Grillo played really well, and we had some other really good rounds, [but Sunday] we weren’t as sharp.”
Lai had the best round on Sunday for Harvard, shooting an even-par 71 to finish tied for 21st on the weekend.
Mirchandani had his best round of the weekend with a 72 to come back and finish tied for 32nd.
Lederhausen finished 32nd as well, ending his weekend with a 76 in the final round.
Pollak and McCarthy both shot a 74 on Sunday, with McCarthy finishing tied for 14th overall and Pollak tied for 24th. Grillo ended his weekend with a score of 75.
Despite the fifth-place finish, the Crimson believes that more consistent play will bring stronger results, especially given the striking distance the team found itself after two rounds of golf.
“I think that biggest part that we can take out of [the tournament], is that we didn’t play great golf that [second] day, and as a team we definitely could have done better,” Grillo said. “And to see that we were close let us know that we have a lot to improve. But having said that, we were right there with the other teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight first varsity eights brought trophies back to the boathouse this weekend by winning the Compton Cup and the Biglin Bowl, respectively, for defeating local and league rivals on the Charles River.
The heavyweights raced Princeton and MIT in Saturday’s racing, while the lightweights squared off against Dartmouth and MIT.
“We planned on coming out strong,” heavyweight captain Mike DiSanto said. “We had a good week of training and were very focused. We’re very happy with our performance and every boat executed like they wanted to.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. MIT, PRINCETON
For the sixth straight year, the Harvard heavyweight 1V secured the Compton Cup with a win over Princeton and MIT.
Crimson boats finished first in Saturday’s other four races to complete the sweep.
“We had a tough weekend last weekend [against Brown], so we were looking to move up from that,” said junior James O’Connor, bow seat of the first varsity eight.
The Harvard first varsity eight heavyweights came through with a victory over Princeton, giving the Tigers (5-1) their first loss of their season.
The Crimson finished with a time of 5:59.5, 5.7 seconds ahead of the Tigers. The Engineers, who came in third, finished far behind both the Crimson and Tigers crews with a time of 6:56.6.
Even though Harvard ultimately finished more than a boat length ahead of the Tigers, the heavyweights knew that they were not going simply to be handed a win.
“We knew Princeton was going to be fast,” O’Connor said. “[But] we were feeling quietly confident.”
The second varsity boat also had a successful outing, winning by the greatest margin of all five races.
The Crimson crossed the finish line eight seconds ahead of the Tigers, completing the course in 6:09.2.
The third varsity boat recorded a five-second win over Princeton while the freshman eight defeated both the Tigers and MIT in 6:09.8.
Overall, the team seemed satisfied with its performances.
“It felt great coming back to the boathouse all together as a team with the Compton Cup,” said senior Nick Jordan, five seat of the second varsity eight.
LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. DARTMOUTH, MIT
The No. 1 Crimson lightweights also performed well this weekend, taking home the Biglin Bowl trophy thanks to the first varsity eight’s win over both Dartmouth and MIT.
The 1V came in first with a margin of 4.2 seconds over the No. 6 Big Green, finishing with a time of 6:12.4. MIT trailed behind with a time of 6:48.7.
“We knew we were going to have to get off the line fast to stay with [Dartmouth], and we were able to respond,” said junior Erich Schultze, three seat of the first varsity eight. “This race was right on track with what we have been doing. It’s fun to win at home because there’s always a nice surge of encouragement to have friends come out and watch.”
The varsity eight was not the only victorious boat.
Harvard’s freshman eight and second freshman eight teams also placed first in their races with a 12-second and a 7.1-second margin of victory, respectively.
Overall, the Crimson took three out of five races on the morning.
The lightweights are eager to continue their success as they look toward the end of their season.
“We have put a lot of hard work into the winter and fall seasons,” said sophomore Michael Wales, bow seat of the first varsity eight. “We are ready to take our team to the next level and bring some heat to the table.  We will keep pushing the limit as the season goes on.”
Last year, at the National Championships, the lightweights came in second place by two-hundredths of a second.
“Our loss from last year has been a lingering factor in our training,” Schultze said. “[That loss] is going to continue to motivate us.”
Because of the motivation that they have from that race, the lightweights continue to work hard in order to keep their No. 1 status.
“We are the No. 1 ranked team in the country, so we have a big target on our backs,” Wales said. “We were ready for the dog fight and were pretty fired up to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With eight minutes to go, the Harvard women’s water polo team seemed poised to defeat Ivy League rival Brown and punch its ticket to the CWPA Southern Division Championship final. But the Bears scored four goals in the fourth quarter to erase a 5-3 Crimson lead and claim the semifinal, 7-6, on Saturday in Lewisburg, Pa.
“[We are] a little bitter about the finish,” co-captain Devan Kennifer said. “Losing to Brown was not fun. It left quite a bit of taste but gave us some fire for the end of the season.”
Harvard (15-10, 4-1 CWPA) finished the weekend 2-1, defeating Mercyhurst and Bucknell by wide margins to take third place at the Southern Division Championship.
“This league has gone back and forth all over the place,” Kennifer said. “It is really anyone’s game. It is tough getting edged out of that first-place game because we wanted a shot at Princeton, and we knew we could take them. It is fuel for the end of the season. It’s not going to hold us back.”
HARVARD 15, BUCKNELL 7
The Crimson faced Bucknell (14-21, 2-3) in its final match of the weekend on Sunday.
“Bucknell was kind of brutal,” freshman goalie Ariel Dukes said. “The other team was really aggressive, but our girls were very tough and wouldn’t let them hang around. It would have been easier for the girls not to try because [we were upset that] we were in the third-place game, but everyone still tried their hardest.”
The first period was a high scoring affair with both teams capitalizing on offensive opportunities. At the end of the first frame, Harvard led, 4-3.
In the second period, the Crimson turned up the defensive pressure, limiting the Bison to one goal while adding five more scores to gain a five-goal lead heading into halftime.
Harvard coasted in the second half, adding six more goals to take third place.
Kennifer scored four times in the contest while Harvard teammates senior Monica Zdrojewski and sophomore Shayna Price contributed three goals apiece.
BROWN 7, HARVARD 6
After opening Saturday with a win in its first game of the tournament, the Crimson fell, 7-6, to the Bears (19-14, 3-2).
Harvard went goal for goal with Brown in the first and second periods, and the teams went into halftime knotted at two.
In the third, the Crimson outscored Brown, 3-1, to take a 5-3 lead going into the final quarter.
“We felt good going into the Brown game,” Kennifer said. “We were really excited to take it to them. We just weren’t shooting well. Our shot percentage was just so low. They ran a huge drop, and we were shooting from far out and just couldn’t get anything. We made their goalie look really good.”
While Harvard held a 5-3 lead heading into the final frame, Brown scored four goals and allowed only one Harvard goal in the period to take the one-goal victory and advance to the CWPA Southern Division Championship game.
Dukes finished with 11 saves while Zdrojewski finished with three goals in the contest.
HARVARD 12, MERCYHURST 3
The Crimson cruised to a win over the Lakers (9-17, 0-5 CWPA) in its first game of the weekend.
Although both teams started off scoreless for the first three minutes of regulation, by the end of the first, Harvard held a 4-0 lead.
“It went fine against Mercyhurst,” Kennifer said. “There were a few things, like plays and six-on-five formations that we didn’t do in the first game, because we knew people would be scouting us for the last two games. It was a good way to shake out the cobwebs.”
Sophomore Shayna Price tied a season high with four goals to lead the Crimson while six other Harvard players also contributed goals in the Crimson victory.
Harvard shut down Mercyhurst defensively, allowing only one goal during the second and third periods while scoring two goals in the second and four in the third to extend its lead to 10-1 going into the final frame.
The Crimson lead extended to as many as ten during the fourth with goals from junior attacker Aisha Price and sophomore attacker Riley Kessler.
Harvard will get a shot at improving upon its third-place finish when it participates in the CWPA Eastern Division Championship beginning April 27.
“It’s definitely a disappointing weekend, but it’s two weeks from now that matters—that’s the win that I want,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We have two weeks to practice. We’re going to go through the two weeks like it’s preseason…and hope we’re playing our best polo in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into this weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team was 2-0 in Ivy play with a solid shot at the league title.
But the Crimson was unable to continue its winning streak, losing to both Penn and Princeton on the road by a score of 4-3.
The visitors came out strong in both contests, taking two of the three doubles matches to give it a 1-0 team lead heading into singles play. But both the Quakers and Tigers outmatched Harvard in singles play, taking four of six bouts en route to their one-point team victories.
Junior Camille Jania and sophomore Natalie Blosser recorded singles wins against Penn, while junior co-captains Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton did the same against Princeton.
Jania, who is 16-3 on the season, also notched two doubles decisions with her senior partner Samantha Gridley at the No. 3 spot.
“We really came out on fire,” Gridley said. “We were down in a lot of matches and came back. It was really incredible.”
The results of the weekend leave the Crimson tied for fourth with Columbia in the Ivy League standings.
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 3
After dropping its contest to Penn the day before, the Crimson lost another close contest to the Tigers, 4-3, to close out its weekend.
In doubles play, Princeton’s tandem of No. 30 Hilary Bartlett and Lindsay Graff took down No. 48 Norton and Tachibana, 8-3, before the duo of Gridley and Jania defeated their foe by the same score.
The doubles point was won by freshman Kelly Whelan and sophomore Hannah Morrill in a tiebreaker, 9-8 (9).
But trouble came in singles play for Harvard. Princeton tied up the team score quickly when Jania lost to Graff, 6-1, 6-0 at the No. 2 position.
Tachibana put her team back up by one with her 6-2, 6-3 victory at the No. 1 court, but Blosser’s 6-1, 6-2 loss and freshman Sylvia Li’s 6-3, 6-4 defeat at the No. 4 and No. 6 spots, respectively, allowed the Tigers to grab the lead.
With Princeton one match away from claiming the team victory, Norton knotted the team score at three with her 6-4, 0-6, 6-3 win at the No. 2 spot, putting the pressure on Gridley and Monica Chow at the No. 5 court.
In a back-and-forth match, Chow finished with the upper hand, 6-3, 6-7 (13), 6-4,to give her team the victory and the Crimson its second loss of the trip.
PENN 4, HARVARD 3
After jumping out to a 3-0 team lead, the Crimson looked to have the match against the Quakers in the bag.
But four-straight singles wins by Penn gave Harvard its first Ivy Season loss on Saturday.
“Against Penn, they surprised us a little bit,” Gridley said. “I think we were a little bit too comfortable.”
The day began well for the Crimson. Gridley and Jania teamed up at the No. 3 doubles spot to defeat Penn’s Stephanie Do and Emma Whitfield, 8-2.
At the No. 1 position, Tachibana and freshman Kelly Whelan dropped their bout, 8-4, putting all eyes on the No. 2 court.
In the closest doubles match of the afternoon, Norton and Morrill stuck out an 8-6 victory to give the Crimson the doubles point after their opponents came back from a three-game deficit to tie the match at six.
In singles, Jania and Blosser eased passed their foes at the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively.
Jania was the first to finish with a 6-1, 6-0 win over the Quakers’ Alex Ion, while Blosser finished close behind with a 6-0, 6-2 win over Daniela DePaoli.
With four more singles matches remaining, Harvard only needed one individual victory to preserve its undefeated Ivy League record.
The first two Crimson losses came at the No. 1 and No. 5 courts. Sol Eskenazi of Penn took down Tachibana at the first spot, 6-2, 6-4, while Srinidhi Raghavan defeated Gridley at the No. 5 position, 6-4, 6-2.
Courts two and six went into three sets. At No. 6, Morrill won the first, 3-6, before losing the ensuing two, 6-4, 6-3.
With the score knotted at three, the deciding match came down to Norton at the No. 2 position.
Norton lost the first set, 6-2, but came back to tie the match at 1-1 after winning the second, 7-5. She was in the lead in the third set, 6-5, when her opponent brought the battle to a stalemate at six.
In the third-set tiebreak, Norton was unable to hold on, falling, 7-4, resulting in the Crimson’s first conference loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the sixth time this season, the Harvard men’s tennis team swept its weekend matches, thanks in large part to strong performances from its freshman class. On Saturday, Harvard blew by Penn, 6-1, while on Sunday, the team defeated Princeton, 5-2, at the Barren Tennis  Center.
“I think both [matches] went really well,” freshman Alex Steinroeder said. “It was good to bounce back after a tough loss last weekend, and I think that everyone on the team really practiced hard this week and really played well this weekend. We all gave our best and it was a great team effort in both matches.”
HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 2
It didn’t take long for Harvard (19-2, 3-1 Ivy) to gain a major lead against the Tigers (16-2, 2-2), and thanks to a consistent performance across the board, the home team finished its weekend with its second successful match, defeating Princeton, 5-2, on Sunday.
The Crimson swept the doubles portion of the day. After senior Jonathan Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz controlled their matchup, winning, 8-5, junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen dealt with their opponents, 8-2. Co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster finished up doubles play winning, 8-7.
In singles, Harvard won four out of six of its matches, with freshmen claiming each of the wins. Harvard’s rookies finished the weekend a perfect 8-0.
“All of the freshmen really pulled through,” Felton said. “They seemed to be nervous [at first] in the Ivy matches, but they really stuck at it this weekend and got some important wins for us.”
Denis Nguyen set the momentum early for the squad, as he defeated his opponent, 6-2, 6-2.
“[Nguyen] got a really impressive win,” Felton said. “It really helped us, helped it sway [the match], as we had a lot of matches that seemed to be in the balance. His win was phenomenal, he played really well.”
Not to be outdone, rookie Shaun Chaudhuri soon downed his counterpart, 6-2, 6-4, and classmate Henry Steer pulled out the win, 6-4, 7-6. Freshman Alex Steinroeder, the only player of the day for the Crimson to play three sets, took the victory, 6-3, 2-6, 6-1.
HARVARD 6, PENN 1
In its second outdoor home match of the season, the Crimson showed its strength against the Quakers (10-8, 2-3), as it dominated from start to finish, winning the doubles point as well as five of the singles matches en route to its 6-1 victory.
Saturday marked the Crimson’s first contest since losing at Columbia the previous weekend, its first loss since Feb. 4.
“We tried not to get discouraged from the loss,” Felton said. “The nature of the Ivy League is that the teams are very close, so it’s rare for one team to win all of its matches. I think it motivated us because we hadn’t lost for a long time, and the team got to understand what it feels like when we lose. We didn’t want a repeat of that, so we worked really hard this week.”
In doubles play, Harvard swept from top to bottom. On court No. 1, Felton and MacMaster defeated their opponents, 8-1, while the two Nguyens took care of their Penn counterparts, 8-4. Pearlman and Schultz followed the trend and quickly finished up their match, 8-5.
“I think the doubles starting off really strong is a really good momentum builder for us,” Steinroeder said. “It’s a good confidence booster knowing that we are putting three really good doubles teams that are performing so well out there. Going into singles we have a little confidence to go forward.”
The Crimson was just as successful in singles play. After a Schultz loss, Harvard quickly retook momentum and in four out of five of the following matches defeated their opponents in only two sets. After Pearlman, who was once again in the No. 1 spot, won his match 6-3, 6-1, the Crimson freshmen took over for their upperclassmen. Chaudhuri claimed his match, 6-3, 6-2, Steinroeder and Henry Steer downed their opponents, 6-0, 7-6, and 6-2, 7-6 (7), respectively.
Steinroeder viewed this weekend’s matches as lessons to take forward into the rest of Ivy play.
“We just have to keep doing what we did to prepare for this weekend,” Steinroeder said. “We now know that, going forward, if we work hard during the week and really prepare for each team, if we don’t take them for granted, we’ll finish off the season strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though its focus never wavers from the all-important Ivy Championships in late April, the Harvard women’s golf team has made sure to devote plenty of time to facing off against non-conference competition. While anything but first place at an Ancient Eight tournament might be a disappointment for the Crimson, its goals for national events are typically more modest and centered on its development for league play.
The 54-hole Ole Miss BancorpSouth Rebel Intercollegiate, held from April 6-8, proved to be no exception, as the Crimson was content to finish 10th among a 15-team field that included three squads in the top 50 of the Golfweek/Sagarin College Rankings.
“We knew this tournament had a tough field, so we were expecting to be about the middle of the pack,” freshman Tiffany Lim said. “Overall, we were really pleased with how we performed, and we know that our games can compete just as well as these other schools.”
Hosted by Ole Miss at the Ole Miss Golf Course in Oxford, Miss., the three-day tournament was won by No. 18 Baylor with a total score of 871 (+7). Eight strokes behind was No. 41 Tulsa, and the 34th-ranked Ole Miss ended up in third.
Harvard finished 47 strokes over par at 911.
Senior Jaclyn Jansen took the individual title for Baylor, while Lim led the No. 104 Crimson with a 224 (+8), which placed her in a tie for 14th individually. The standout rookie has turned in her squad’s top performance in all but one of Harvard’s six events in 2011-12.
“The first couple days she didn’t hit it quite as well, but then she putted well. [Sunday] she actually hit it quite well and didn’t make as many putts,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It worked that way with everyone. Each day, one thing kind of didn’t work as well.”
Lim’s worst showing—a 76 (+4)—came in the final round Sunday, when Harvard’s five representatives totaled their highest combined score of the tournament.
Though the weather was not a factor, Lim pointed to the par-72, 6,313-yard course’s length, numerous hills, and fast greens as challenges unique to a non-Ivy tournament. Also responsible for the squad’s uneven performance was a build-up of rust accumulated during the colder months.
“This weekend, we saw some really good play and also some mistakes that might be left over from not playing as much over the winter,” captain Christine Cho said.
While the event was Baylor’s fourth team tournament of the spring season—and its second victory—the Crimson resumed outdoor play just last month. It defeated Nova Southeastern, a Division II team, three weeks ago in its only other competitive play of the spring.
“We were proud of the way we played given how much preparation we had,” Lim said.
The Crimson finished the first round on April 6 in sixth place—ahead of teams including No. 55 Maryland and No. 76 Kansas State—before a 301 on Saturday dropped it to eighth.
“Everyone played good stretches. It’s just hard for anyone to put [54 holes] together right now,” Rhoads said.
It might have finished worse than 10th place for the weekend if not for a charge by freshman Brenna Nelsen. Lim’s only classmate on the squad, Nelsen rebounded from a first-round 80 (+8) to shoot a combined 145 (+1) over the next two days.
“Besides the first six holes of the tournament, she played great the whole time,” Rhoads said.
Sophomore Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor, finished in a tie for 41st overall with a three-day total of 230 (+14).
Cho and classmate Jane Lee finished in ties for 73rd and 76th, respectively, to round out the team’s effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, the Harvard track and field team came out strong against Yale in a dual meet at the McCurdy Outdoor Track.
The men’s and women’s teams came away with the sweep, the women claiming a 89-73 victory and the men finishing on top, 114-49.
“My expectations were to have a great team performance, and that’s exactly what happened,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “There are a lot of positives to draw from this.”
“[Saturday] was really a team kind of day; we pulled each other along, and I’m very proud that I am faster now than I was at this time last year,” said freshman Erika  Veidis, who brought home a win in the 800-meter dash (2:09:90).
Along with Veidis, co-captain Meghan Looney and sophomore Olivia Abbate each ran well in their races.
Looney took third in the 1500m, and Abbate finished first in the 100m hurdles with a time of 14:04, earning first by three seconds and setting a new personal record.
“Everyone had a lot of enthusiasm, and it was a good workout in preparation for the Heps championships,” said Looney about the upcoming event, which begins on May 5.
On the men’s side, freshman Jarvis Harris came out flying in each of his events.
Harris finished first in both the 110m hurdles and the triple jump and seventh in the 200m dash.
Senior Darcy Wilson also started strong, earning a personal record in the 1500m run with a time of 3:50:96. Wilson earned two first-place finishes, one in the 1500m and the other in the 800m race.
“I was very pleased with my performance, and as a senior it is one of my last chances to do well,” Wilson said. “I just have to compete to win, and the times will come.”
Junior Nico Weiler also had success in the pole vault, finishing first in front of a small crowd that gathered at that event.
Freshman Benjamin Glauser followed Weiler’s performance by placing first in the hammer and second in the shot put.
“The success of your day will be defined in one second,” Glauser said. “The hardest part for me is overcoming that mental battle. My expectations were higher than I actually threw, but that keeps me hungry and wanting more.”
On the track, Harvard owned the 100m dash, with sophomores Connor McCarthy, Andrew Ezekoye, and Damani Wilson taking first through third, respectively.
McCarthy finished in 10.87 seconds, .03 ahead of Ezekoye.
Harvard also finished in the top three spots in the 3000m, as sophomore James Leakos took first followed by rookies Daniel Milechman and Billy Orman.
Leakos crossed the finish line in 8:24.47, while Milechman and Orman turned in times of 8:29.02 and 8:30.21, respectively.
Yale’s Tim Hillas was the first Bulldog to finish, posting a time of 8:30.52.
Matt Bieszard had greater success on the men’s side for the Bulldogs, claiming first in the 200m and 400m dashes.
But it was not enough, as the Crimson men finished with the 65-point win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final tournament tune-up before the looming Ivy League Championships, the Harvard women’s golf team returned to its winning ways over the past weekend with some help from an unlikely source.
Senior Jane Lee turned in the two best rounds of her collegiate career, shooting a two-day total of 145 (+1) to finish in second place overall and lead the Crimson to a six-stroke victory at the 36-hole Roar-EE Invitational at Spook Rock Golf Course in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
Host Columbia finished in second place with a 606 (+30), and St. John’s took third at 625 (+49). The only other Ivy team, Dartmouth, tied for sixth.
A total of 306 (+18) on Friday earned Harvard the top spot out of 15 competitors heading into Saturday’s final round, but it was anything but satisfied.
“A lot of us got frustrated because we were missing putts,” freshman Tiffany Lim said. “The greens were bumpy. The second day, we realized...we couldn’t control what the ball did after it left our club face.”
The squad then turned in a 294 (+8) to come away with its first multi-team tournament title since winning the Princeton Invitational in late September.
“Everyone worked really hard to keep their focus on the things they could control...and stayed committed to the shot instead of the score,” Lee said. “I think it was a good indication of where we’re headed as a team.”
The Lions were led by overall first-place finisher sophomore Michelle Piyapattra—the reigning league individual champion—who dominated the par-72, 6008-yard course on Saturday with a 69.
Lee’s standout performance, which placed her just one stroke behind Piyapattra, was more surprising. The veteran had not finished first on the team in competition all year and came into the tournament averaging a score of 80 per round.
But after turning in a 75 Friday, Lee came back with a 70 the next day to take home the silver medal.
“It was all my mental game—I think I managed the pressure better, because usually toward the end [of a tournament], I get nervous, and I stop committing to shots or start thinking about score, which is always what our coach is telling us to avoid,” Lee said. “This was the one time I felt my mind was in the right place for all 36 holes.... I thought that this was a near-perfect round, a near-perfect tournament for me.”
Each of Harvard’s representatives finished no worse than a tie for 16th place.
In the best performance of her collegiate career, freshman Brenna Nelsen tied for sixth with a 151 (+7), while her classmate Lim shot 155 (+11) to finish in 14th place overall.
“Brenna’s a consistent player, and she produces a lot of solid scores in the 70s,” said captain Christine Cho of the California native, who went 77-74 over the weekend.
The highly touted rookie Lim, who had led the Crimson in scoring in all but one of its tournaments prior to this weekend, pointed to her mental game for her own below-average showing.
“I didn’t really trust myself when I was out on the course,” Lim said. “After the first day, I shot 80 and I was frustrated.... When I forgot about score and forgot about my techniques and just hit the ball, everything just came together.”
On the second day, Lim shot a 75.
Sophomore Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor, and Cho each posted scores of 157 (+13) to round out the Harvard effort.
The tournament victory came one week after Harvard finished 10th out of 15 teams at Ole Miss’s Rebel Intercollegiate, which represented just its second taste of spring competition.
“We had been struggling a little before, and I feel like some of the team was doubting ourselves a little bit, because we hadn’t been playing out of the winter months,” Lim said. “Columbia’s tournament really helped prove to us that we’re ready for Ivies.”
Last year’s league runner-up will now have two weeks to further prepare for the Ancient Eight’s perennial showdown, held at the Seaview Bay Course in Galloway, N.J.

At 10:35 p.m. Friday night Winthrop HoCo issued an official pledge of support for Adams House, giving Adams its first ally in the Housing War. Adams has been alone in its struggle against Currier House and its allies Cabot, Pforzheimer, and Mather Houses since Tuesday when the Housing War began.
"Our main goal is access to Lowell gate," said Lauren E. Tiedemann '13, co-chair of Winthrop House Committee, which has already declared war on Lowell House. She explained that Adams House has an incentive to help Winthrop fight for swipe access to Lowell Gate, whereas citizens of the Quad Houses and Mather House probably would not care about Winthrop's challenges because of their remote locations.
Strategic conversations about the benefits of allying with other Houses circulated over THROPTALK, the Winthrop open email list, over the past few days. Tiedemann said that some Winthrop students believe Adams House to be overly pretentious, but others agreed with Adams House's defense against the infiltration of its inner House voting process.
Ultimately, Winthrop residents decided to form an alliance with Adams through an online poll. According to Tiedemann, over 100 Winthropians participated in the vote and about 60 percent were in favor of forming an alliance with Adams House. Special precautions were taken to ensure that the Winthrop poll was not tampered with by outside forces.
Adams House was grateful for Winthrop's support in this struggle. "When we went to war those that called us friends were nowhere to be found," said Adams House Committee Special Projects Chair Antone Martinho III '13.  Martinho also expressed his regret that the Winthrop alliance has pitted Adams against Lowell House, a House that Adams had considered to be a tentative friend.
Martinho said, "Our war is primarily with Currier. We're not going to stray from that," but he also said that Adams is willing to support their new ally if necessary. In a statement released at noon on Saturday, Adams House wrote: "In light of Winthrop's pledge of support in our growing conflict, we too pledge our support to Winthrop, that in what conflicts it may have, we shall be supportive."

Flyby went to YardFest, and we eavesdropped on a few conversations. Here is what we heard:
Girl by Widener: 
"I got it! I got some crack!"
Two days before YardFest:
1: "Are you excited about The Cataracs?"
2: "Yeah...I don't even know who The Cataracs are. I'm just excited for day drinking."
On the grass:
1. "Where's [name omitted]?"
2. "I left her for two minutes to get her water. When I got back, she was with HUPD. Apparently she was falling all over herself."
1. "Damn. That girl goes too hard."
Weld bathroom:
"Never been this drunk in my life. I'm too drunk. My pants are not buttoned."
By the stage:
1. "Oh my God, look at them grinding. She's literally butt-massaging his knee."
2. "Awkward height difference..."

Not even a "Warm Weather Advisory" will prevent the most die-hard athletes from running the 2012 Boston Marathon. With temperatures predicted to soar into the mid and upper 80s, event organizers issued a bulletin encouraging inexperienced runners to skip the race, offering them the option of deferring and participating next year. But for spectators yearning for a taste of summer in April, the warm weather provides a great excuse to get outside. Here are a few of the best places to witness all of the action:
Boston College
Runners follow Commonwealth Ave., past Boston College, as they make their way toward downtown. Find a spot along the street, and join in the excitement of a college-aged crowd. From Harvard, take the red line to Park Street and transfer to a Boston College-bound green line train.
Kenmore Square Area
The Boston Red Sox are playing in Fenway at 11 a.m. Crowds for the baseball game mixed with spectators for the marathon will make for heavy traffic and public transit nightmares. However, you can take the Harvard M2 Shuttle (free!) across the Charles River to Beacon St. and then walk a few blocks down Mass Ave. to Commonwealth Avenue.
Copley Square (The Finish Line!)
Join hundreds of thousands of spectators at the most exciting part of the race. If you're seeking excitement, can handle hordes of people, and are willing to walk, this is the place for you. Copley Square station is closed, so you'll have to take the green line to Arlington and do some walking.
For those who prefer the comfort of their dorm room, the marathon will be broadcast free online at UniversalSports.com starting at 9:30 a.m.
