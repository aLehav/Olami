After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actor Ashton Kutcher addressed members of the Class of 2020 at their Class Day dinner Saturday night, telling them they allowed him to maintain hope amid adversities.
After they were sent packing in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, College students from the Classes of 2020 and 2021 never received in-person graduation ceremonies. Harvard is set to host a joint Commencement ceremony celebrating both classes Sunday, where Attorney General Merrick B. Garland ’74 will deliver the keynote address. Actress Adjoa Andoh spoke at the Class of 2021’s Class Day dinner Saturday.
An actor, producer, and entrepreneur, Kutcher starred in the sitcom “That ’70s Show,” which ran from 1998 to 2006. He made his film debut in 1999 and went on to star as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in “Jobs.”
Aside from his acting career, Kutcher co-founded the human rights organization Thorn, which focuses on defending children from online sexual abuse. He has also invested in several start-ups, including Uber and Airbnb, through his venture capital firm.
In his address — part of which he formatted as if it were an Oscar acceptance speech — Kutcher thanked various members of his family for showing him the benefits of optimism, hard work, and unconditional love.
Referring to the graduates and families in the crowd as “fellow nominees,” Kutcher said they inspired him to maintain hope amid recent national news, alluding to both the deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and the recent leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn the landmark case Roe v. Wade.
“You are the people I admire. It’s you that gives me hope,” he said. “When children are taking their last breaths in classrooms, where they’re learning about the re-ignition of a Cold War while the Earth is on fire because of man-made heat, it is you that gives me conviction that equality can exist, that we can close economic wage gap while our representatives hand out checks to buy our allegiance.”
“It is you that emboldens me to believe that she will always have a choice,” Kutcher added to applause.
Members of the student group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine protested Kutcher’s speech, holding up signs, including one that read “Kutcher Funds Apartheid.”
Abraham E. Rebollo-Trujillo ’20, one of the organizers of the protest, pointed to Kutcher’s attendance of the 2018 Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces gala — which raised $60 million for Israeli soldiers.
“I felt that it would be a shame to not even spark a conversation about what’s happening,” Rebollo-Trujillo said.
A Harvard spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the protest. Kutcher could not be reached for comment.
Eric J. Cheng ’20, the First Marshal of the Class of 2020, opened the Class Day dinner by acknowledging recent hardships and reaffirming Harvard’s capacity to inspire hope.
“Regardless of how our perspectives changed, at one point in time each of us stood in this very yard, and felt that no matter who we were, where we came from, here, we could do anything,” he said. “I’m convinced that this aspect of Harvard — it being comprised of the most passionate hearts and minds in the world, those who will help us build a brighter future — remains true.”
“That gives me what I — and I think a lot of us — need. Hope,” Cheng added.
Austin J. Lentsch ’20, the final student speaker of the evening and his class’s Ivy Orator, said the Class of 2020 would not be defined by what they lost during the pandemic, “but what we’re going to do with the pandemic experience that we’ve gained.”
“Each of you have an irreplaceable role to play in this society that we need to build together,” he said.
“Let’s heal. Let’s move on,” Lentsch added. “Let’s use this fresh start and remember why we actually came here in the first place: After two long years of Covid, we finally — finally — get to commence. So let’s begin.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
British actress Adjoa Andoh, known for playing Lady Danbury in the television series “Bridgerton,” called on members of the Harvard College Class of 2021 to leverage their “global reach” and “glory in the miracle of being alive” at an in-person Class Day dinner on Saturday.
The dinner comes one year after the Class of 2021’s virtual Class Day event, which featured professional basketball player Jeremy Lin ’10 as a keynote speaker.
Harvard postponed in-person Commencement activities for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Class Day, an annual tradition celebrating College graduates, typically occurs the day before Commencement exercises. The school will hold Commencement for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 on Sunday.
In addition to her role in “Bridgerton,” Andoh starred in and co-directed the first Shakespeare play on a major British stage featuring all women of color, “Richard II.” She has also appeared in the sci-fi show “Doctor Who” and the medical television series “Casualty.”
During Saturday’s speech, Andoh said she was proud to address “Harvard’s first majority-minority class in its 380 year history.”
This milestone, she noted, came after Harvard published a landmark report detailing Harvard’s economic and pedagogical ties to slavery and pledged $100 million to educational support for marginalized groups, memorialization, communication with direct descendants, and more.
The current times are “groundbreaking times indeed,” she added, “worthy of reflection and perhaps a shift in the lens through which the story of Harvard will be received in the future.”
Andoh also acknowledged other recent moments of social change, including the Black Lives Matter movement, the Me Too movement, as well as the recent tragedy in Uvalde, Texas, where a deadly school shooting killed 19 students and two teachers. She called on the Class of 2021 to consider how they, as students of an “elite American institution,” will use their potential to enact global change.
“Your nation’s reach is global,” she said. “Your power to influence to uplift or throw down is unrivaled on the planet. And whether you are an American citizen or an overseas student, by studying at this elite American institution, Class of 2021, you are now active movers and shakers in the flow of that global reach and influence.”
“What will you do with your American reach and your Harvard glow?” she said.
Andoh reflected on the diversity displayed in “Bridgerton,” which featured numerous actors of color, and charged the Class of 2021 with “celebrating your differences.”
“No one was excluded from the ‘Bridgerton’ invitation at a time of isolation,” she said. “Everyone was welcomed in and more. It challenged our preconceptions about history, about who was there, who did what, who has a claim to be a part of what.”
She concluded by urging the class to find joy in themselves and in others.
“May you live in a world of ‘ubuntu,’ the South African and Nguni Bantu term that says, ‘I am because we are,’ that the suffering of one is the suffering of all — the joy of one is the joy of all,” she said. “May you, class of 2021, have the courage to follow your soul’s delight and wholeheartedly glory in the miracle of being alive.
First Marshal Samyra C. Miller ’21, Harvard Alumni Association President Vanessa W. Liu ’96, and Second Marshal Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 also delivered remarks at Saturday’s event, mirroring last year’s virtual program.
Cyrus N. Faruque ’21 and Yuke Zheng ’21 also spoke about their effort to gift Harvard’s first commemorative non-fungible tokens to the Class of 2021. NFTs are a digital asset that represent ownership over a real-world image or object.
Zheng said that within 24 hours of releasing the NFTs, one had already sold for $500.
“Who knows, maybe 40 years from now, we can all retire on these NFTs,” Zheng said. “This is a timeless asset. It can only go up.”
Mario O. Haskett Jr. ’21 concluded the evening with a rendition of the 2021 Class Ode.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Attorney General Merrick B. Garland ’74 called on the Harvard Classes of 2020 and 2021 to pursue public service and “fulfill the promise” of democracy at their joint Commencement ceremony held on Sunday.
Harvard postponed in-person Commencement exercises for both classes due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but welcomed the recent graduates back to Cambridge for a historically large ceremony with the traditional pomp and circumstance.
Garland, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, serves as the 86th Attorney General of the United States under President Joe Biden. Previously, while serving as chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016, Garland was nominated for the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation process by denying him a hearing.
Garland, a former Crimson editor, congratulated the “patient and indomitable” Classes of 2020 and 2021 on completing their education despite the pandemic, and urged them to commit to public service as he did during his time at the College.
“I hope you will make a promise similar to the one that I made — to devote some part of your life to public service,” Garland said.
Many of Garland’s ancestors immigrated to the United States to escape religious persecution before World War I. Some who stayed behind, he said, were killed during the Holocaust. Garland said his enduring commitment to public service is his way of expressing gratitude for the country where his family took refuge.
“For me, public service is a way to repay the debt my family owes to this country for our very lives,” he said.
Garland acknowledged recent mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas; Laguna Woods, Calif.; and Buffalo, N. Y.; saying they “only underscore” the urgency of his call to public service.
“As we gather today to celebrate this milestone in your lives, we are also holding onto an enormous amount of grief because of yet another mass shooting at another school in our country,” Garland said. “I know I speak for all of us, here, that our hearts are broken.”
Garland also told graduates there is an “urgent need to defend democracy” amid the war in Ukraine and following the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
“In a democracy, people vote, argue, and debate — often loudly — in order to achieve the policy outcome they desire,” he said. “The promise of democracy is that people will not employ violence to affect that outcome.”
“You are the next generation that must devote yourselves to preserving our democracy and helping others protect theirs,” Garland added.
Shortly after the ceremony began on Sunday, more than a dozen Harvard affiliates, in partnership with the Boston Area Assange Defense, demonstrated at the Smith Campus Center. The protestors demanded that the Justice Department drop charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian P. Assange and prevent the journalist’s extradition to the United States.
Assange currently faces 18 charges related to his disclosure of classified information through WikiLeaks. In April, a London court ordered his extradition to the U.S.
Michael A. Miccioli ’22, who helped organize the protest, said Harvard’s commencement would be a “good opportunity” to bring attention to Assange’s prosecution.
“We thought that rather than just glorifying Merrick Garland, the people of Harvard should be outraged that he’s being invited to speak,” Miccioli said. “If Julian Assange is prosecuted and convicted for his work, that would open the door for any investigative journalist to potentially be prosecuted in the future for their standard work.”
The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the protest.
Kicked off campus in March 2020 as Covid arrived, the Classes of 2020 and 2021 had virtual Commencements in their respective graduating years. Former Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron spoke at the virtual 2020 Commencement, and Prairie View A&M University President Ruth J. Simmons addressed the Class of 2021 during their ceremony.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow delivered opening remarks, in which he called the decision to send students home during the pandemic “one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.”
“I’m not sure whether or not to call this day Commencement or, candidly, your first reunion,” Bacow said.
In the opening minutes of the ceremony, a plane pulling a banner with the address harvardmedhurtsworkers.org flew over Harvard Yard. The corresponding website — paid for by Boston’s International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103, which represents some Harvard Medical School contract workers — alleged the school is “undermining” its maintenance workers by pursuing pay cuts.
HMS spokesperson Ekaterina D. Pesheva did not respond to a request for comment Sunday.
“The school is famously well-funded and more than capable of providing family-sustaining wages,” the website promoted on the banner reads. “Instead, it’s deciding to nickel and dime the people who work each day to keep its medical facilities safe and functioning.”
During the ceremony, Harvard conferred five honorary degrees, including a Doctor of Laws to Baron, whom University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 called a “paragon of the press.”
Sociologist Arlie R. Hochschild, former Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall, Brazilian photographer Sebastião R. Salgado, and actress Anna Deavere Smith also received honorary degrees.
In the final moments of his speech, Garland, visibly emotional, said he had faith democracy will be better off when it is time for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 to “pass the baton” to the next generation.
“Although what I’m asking of you is daunting, I know that you are the next generation that will fulfill the promise this country represents,” Garland said.
