“Cool Choices,” the fourth solo album of S, AKA Jenn Ghetto, couldn’t have had a more spot-on title. That is, if cool meant cold in a lifeless, disengaging sort of way. Coming from indie rock band “Carissa’s Wierd,” known for their mumbled lyrics and ghostly chamber rock music, Ghetto incorporates much of the same uninflected, muted tones into her songs. It comes as no surprise that the opening track already feels tedious, a sensation that carries on throughout the rest of the album.
Although there are more instruments used in this album compared to her previous album “I’m Not As Good At It As You,” which consisted of only the strumming of simple guitar chords, the repetitive lyrics in songs like “White Horse” and “Let the Light In” make it easy for this soundtrack to lose focus and fade into the background. It doesn’t help that many of her lyrics are unadorned to the point of sounding like a laundry list of an angst-ridden teenager. This is especially noticeable in “Vampires,” in which Ghetto delivers a line of short fragments: “I’m crazy. You’re fucked up. Mind games. Thrown back. T-shirts. Left out. Airplanes. Phone calls. New friends.”
If the simplicity of the lyrics isn’t the problem, then the lack of them is. In “Muffin,” long periods of instrumentals drag on only to be interrupted by awkward pauses, which disorient the listener and make the album sound unstructured. There is a constant bombardment of jumbled sounds in the majority of the tracks on the album. This uneasy ambiance is compounded by the blunt way in which her lyrics confront the listener. Ghetto’s matter-of-fact delivery of her lyrics is unconvincing and at times off-putting.
The intention of S’s style does have its merits; her minimalistic approach gives her songs a sense of honesty. Her lyrics are a direct result of her saying whatever she feels like saying, without embellishment and without the need to conform to any specific genres, which deserves applause in its own right. The lack of conspicuous emotions in the intonation allows the listeners to interpret the meaning or reasons behind the words as they wish. In that way, her album is pure; it provides a blank canvas for the listener to create his or her own auditory image. However, the problem with this ambiguous execution throughout the songs is that more often than not, it creates the impression of being monotonous and, for lack of a better term, drab. Her determination to communicate the same one emotion leads to an album that largely consists of uninspiring, homogenous beats.
The goal then, for Ghetto, is to achieve a balance between capturing and maintaining the attention of the listeners with more variation, and still conveying the honest emotion. Potential for this can be heard in the song “Remember Love” and the penultimate track, “Pacific,” in which S employs more sophisticated lyrics and hints at emotions in her song. In the chorus of Pacific, she sings, "Know there is someone who loves you. I'll find the hope on the floor of the ocean / I won't have to see you with someone else. Leave you a note with all the things that I never said / Believe there is someone who loves you." However, these significant increases in complexity are few and far between and not enough to distract from the lyrical shortcomings of the remainder of the album.
It all comes down to mindset. If the listener is willing to pause, take a deeper listen, and really pay attention to emotion conveyed through the uniformity of the songs, “Cool Choices” can prove to be a rewarding, emotional experience.

In many ways, SBTRKT’s second studio album holds true to the mission he undertook with his first. A pioneer of the post-dubstep genre, the solo musician Aaron Jerome boldly experiments with unexpected yet restrained beats, sounds, and harmonies as a centerpiece for the album. Unlike most modern artists today, SBTRKT even pushes away the necessity for a verse-chorus-bridge organization; instead, he relies on the layering of new harmonies and rhythms to propel the songs forward. But what really seems to drive his artistic calling is not fame or distinction within a particular style of music, but rather a pure, unassuming love for exploration. Ever since his debut album in 2011, SBTRKT has made a point of preserving his anonymity, performing live shrouded in tribal masks, releasing his music to radio stations namelessly—even the very name SBTRKT shows that Jerome truly takes himself out of the equation. What’s left behind is a naked curiosity with nothing to hide and no reputation to tarnish.
SBTRKT uses this freedom to his advantage in this second installation. In each track, he blazes new trails, refusing to be pinned down by a single style or pattern. This makes for a more experimental than cohesive aura around the album, where each song comes with new ideas and questions. Just as he establishes an unpredictable craze in “Gon Stay” with bursts of harmonic percussion and a catchy bassline, Jerome takes a step back in the stripped-down pop ballad “If It Happens” by relying on only simplistic piano and vocals.
Despite this versatility, it must be said that patience is a reliable virtue for SBTRKT. In the first full track, “Wonder Where We Land,” he finds a similar style to that of his first album through a renewed partnership with the soloist Sampha. The hauntingly beautiful vocals balance with the restrained but often unexpected background bass and white noise to give the song a slow, laid-back development. As the track name suggests, this anticipatory listening experience leaves us wondering where the song itself will land—a refreshing sense of uncertainty within a musical age so drawn to easy, consistently attractive harmonies.
“Look Away” reinforces this strength, starting with minimal, suspenseful instrumentation with only high-pitch percussion and rolled chords, steadily evolving into a layered creation with more complex, engaging riffs and harmonies. As Jerome allows the song to take shape slowly and clunkily, listeners hear and anticipate the potential direction and possibility that the song presents. SBTRKT then manipulates our anticipation by sliding back into uncertainty at the end, and not arriving at the climax we were expecting.
However, once SBTRKT abandons that patience, the album gets a little less consistent. In “Lantern,” a single pattern of notes dominates the whole song, with the occasional interruption of a contrasting harp-like solo to put the listener out of place. While the intention to highlight the extremes is evident within the song, it lacks the direction and appeal of his more unpredictable yet attractive tracks. “Everybody Knows” is the other side of the coin. Although it sticks to the same riff for the entire song, it’s catchy and fun in a way that SBTRKT’s other songs aren’t. For the three minutes and 31 seconds of that repeated riff, we don’t need the suspenseful restraint; we’re not waiting for something to happen. We’re happy with just enjoying what’s being laid on the table. This is much more in the style of generic pop, but he does it cleanly and he does it well. The last track on the album, “Voices in My Head” features A$AP Ferg, blending two seemingly contradictory styles—but Jermone makes it work perfectly. SBTRKT stays true to his unpredictability with strategic surges and insertions of sounds while giving a dark and often restrained background to Ferg’s fast-paced but laid-back rap. What comes out is a grounded, strong track that shows promise through its direction, dark atmosphere, and occasional unpredictability.
SBTRKT’s album is far from perfect and has plenty of moments that just don’t work. But it also doesn’t seem like it was at all his intention to create anything that memorable or groundbreaking. As a guy who subtracts his identity in every way possible from his music, SBTRKT aims more to explore new fields and leave no stone unturned.

Childish Gambino’s new single may be labeled as a rough cut, but “Sober” may actually be one of his smoothest tunes to date, although that may not be an entirely good thing. The actor-turned-rapper seems to have introduced an unfamiliar skill into his already varied repertoire: singing. On his new track, Gambino breathily croons over an effervescent melody and relaxed, feedback-y beat to culminate in a bass drop and a spacey, drifting outro.
While the soulful stylings of Gambino are far from unpleasant, the lyrics are generic and uninspired. On “Sober,” Gambino compares a past relationship to a drug-induced euphoria using only the tritest of terms. He sings, “If you just give me some time, I can open up your mind. If you le-le-let it shine, you can free-ee-ee your mind.” Gone are Gambino’s characteristic rhymes: clever ones, full of unabashedly inappropriate references (e.g. “Human Centipede” and Casey Anthony), delivered sometimes with anger, sometimes as a boast, but always with a touch of impassioned hysteria. Gambino as a singer, not a rapper, may be an idea with some potential, but his performance on “Sober” is not enough to distract from what might have been.
Gambino recently revealed that his upcoming mixtape “STN MTN / KAUAI” would be a double album, with the first single—“Sober”—being taken from the “KAUAI” side. However, although “Sober” is the first single, it may not serve as a good litmus test for the new album as a whole. A double album leaves plenty of room for Gambino to rap or sing or surprise us anew.
“STN MTN / KAUAI” has no release date but is out later this year.

Mike Hadreas is getting his blood all over your new couch, ruining your dress, frightening all your guests. He’s sashaying around your dinner table in a ragged skinsuit, and now your mother is crying, and your father is packing you a suitcase. He’s screaming at the top of his lungs from the bottom of the well, and he isn’t going to shut up until you listen.
Hadreas’s first two albums as Perfume Genius were dispatches from the periphery, grotesque portraits of love poisoned by violence and fear. Tracks like “Mr. Petersen” and “17” recounted spare tales of unspeakable trauma through Hadreas’s frayed warble, surrounded with childlike piano and empty space—desperate attempts to make sense of devastation by spinning it into something affecting.
But now he’s had some time to think, and he’s mad as hell. Where he used to craft fragile beauty out of despair, with “Too Bright,” Perfume Genius fashions enduring beauty out of fiery, unapologetic rage. The album’s 11 tracks compose an astonishing document of queer fury, an avowed refusal to remain silent about the horrors of living in a world that’s always suspicious of your body.
The unflinching honesty that characterized Hadreas’s previous work is still intact, and with the help of Portishead’s Adrian Utley and a newly aggressive sonic palette, he’s managed to weaponize it. Instead of shying away from the most deep-seated fears plaguing the queer community—abuse, abandonment, body dysmorphia, the lingering stigma of HIV/AIDS—Hadreas does the opposite, embodying these fears, wearing them like armor, turning them against their creators. On “Queen,” the album’s debut single and in many ways its thesis statement, Hadreas saunters over a bed of distorted guitar and florid keyboards, gleefully proclaiming that “No family is safe / When I sashay.”
It is this fury, combined with Hadreas’s directness and musical prowess, that gives “Too Bright” its inescapable bite. “Fool” starts out with unflappable cool, with Hadreas delivering lines about dresses and couches like a dutiful cast member of “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy”—but then he stops the song in its tracks and lets loose the most gorgeous falsetto scream this side of Sigur Rós. The soulful finger snaps return as if nothing happened, but now he’s “Bleeding out / On the couch you bought / That I picked out.”
As the album progresses, Hadreas bares his teeth with increasing menace. “My Body” is a two-minute burlesque show in a padded cell, its queasy bass throb giving out to an eruption of electronic viscera as Hadreas masquerades as Jame Gumb impersonating Dita Von Teese: “I wear my body like a rotted peach / You can have it if you handle the stink.”
“Too Bright” reaches its darkest and its most daring point with surreal “Grid.” In case you’ve forgotten that AIDS was known as “gay-related immune deficiency” until 1984, “Grid” weds the ignominious acronym to the city streets the disease continues to ravage—“There is no angel above the grid / Maybe baby, this is it,” sings Hadreas. “I’m a Mother” drags Radiohead’s Vocoder-ravaged “Kid A” to the bottom of a hole—over a hazy death waltz, Hadreas defiles his suffocating voice to the point where the only discernible words are the lines “Down here / I’m a mother.” It’s the most disturbing track on an album that dares you to stop listening.
Yet whenever the darkness seems like it’s just about to overwhelm, Hadreas lets a little light in with several more traditional piano numbers, which recast the monstrosities on the heavier tracks in more human terms. “No Good” wonders if it’s possible to make a “Safe place for the heart to hang / When the body’s no good,” finding temporary solace when Hadreas takes “his hand in mine for a little while.” The title track is a paean to integrity in the face of certain violence, and Hadreas minces no words when evoking the potential consequences of being yourself: “I’ll try, I’ll stay / Hung and drawn / Laid upon the highway.” These tracks may be quieter, but they’re no less forceful for it.
The tension doesn’t fully dissipate until closing track “All Along,” the closest Hadreas has ever gotten to pure pop balladry. Over soft electric guitar, he wonders out loud about the gay man’s place in the universe: “What drives me to my man? / Earthly or divine or otherwise?” He humbly concludes, “It’s no business of mine / You wasted my time.” As the song blossoms into a closing-time slow dance, over soft drums and gleaming steel guitar, Hadreas entreats, “I don’t need your love / I don’t need you to understand / I need you to listen.”
He never promised it would be an easy listen, but it shouldn’t be, when there’s still so much work to be done. “Too Bright” is a relentlessly human declaration of discontent spoken through a crystal-clear queer voice. Mike Hadreas is furious—and you’re allowed to be, too.

Richard Linklater’s summer film “Boyhood” was the first place many of us encountered material from “Sukierae,” the debut album from Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy’s side project with his son Spencer. “Boyhood” features the song “Summer Noon,” a light and airy tribute to growing up and experiencing the world. It makes sense that the film and “Sukierae” would intersect, as they deal with very similar themes. Linklater makes his theme very evident in the title of his film, while Jeff Tweedy keeps his better shrouded. At the heart of each of these works are fathers, sons, and mothers, as well as the relentless passing of time. Christopher Orr, a reviewer for The Atlantic, wrote that while “Boyhood” was good, a more ambitious movie might have been called “Adulthood.” “Sukierae” is that concept realized.
The album begins with something of a false start. “Please Don’t Let Me Be So Misunderstood” opens with barreling guitar and energetic drum beats. It’s noisy and angsty, and Jeff Tweedy sings in a raspy sort of yell. But with the second track, “High as Hello,” Tweedy settles into much more familiar territory for Wilco fans: the wispy, sometimes sleepy sound for which the band is famous.
Still, the album manages to break ground while staying true to Tweedy’s signature aesthetic. “Slow Love” has an extended instrumental intro that showcases the drumming ability of Spencer Tweedy. “I’ll Sing It” features an eerie, discordant bridge that bursts open into a catchy chorus fusing Motown with Nirvana, only to cut it off again with a series of noises that sound like something out of a black-and-white horror movie.
In “Down from Above,” Tweedy sings in a meek voice above a slow, steady, drumbeat, evocative of a ticking clock. It has a deeply personal, mournful quality, lamenting the infirmity of his wife, who is battling with cancer, but also of mortality itself. The drumbeat presses on, and in that same small voice Tweedy sings, “When the last book is written, the last song is sung. When the last beginner has begun / Down from above, comes the day, a light is made, to go away.”
And yet, throughout the album, a second story is being told. With every strike of the drum we are reminded of another presence in the music. While Jeff Tweedy is beginning the descent down the arc of adulthood, Spencer is at its summit. His youth can be felt on songs like “Low Key” and “Summer Noon.” At times it almost feels as though we are looking in on a conversation between Jeff and Spencer, a father relaying memories and confessions to his son. This effect is reached fully in “Pigeons,” where Spencer’s drums are absent and Jeff Tweedy offers advice and observations to his son in a vulnerable whisper.
It’s stripped-down that Tweedy sounds best. It’s in these moments that Jeff Tweedy’s message becomes clear and his decision to make an album with his son, at this point in his career, makes perfect sense. This is an ode to autumn and the coming winter. It’s a portrait of middle age, and a talented son, and a wife who is struggling to hold on.
“Sukierae” has flaws. With a tracklist of 20 songs, it feels tedious and drawn out at times. But despite its failings, the album represents an important step forward in both Jeff and Spencer Tweedy’s careers. Jeff Tweedy is one of the few artists who have been continually successful in remaining true to his fan base while developing as a musician. From the abrupt entrance to the slow, sad end, the album manages to be deeply personal and affecting, while remaining a comfortable listen.

This year, the Grammy Award-winning Parker String Quartet are the Blodgett Artists-in-Residence at Harvard University. Founded in 2002 when its members were students at the New England Conservatory of Music, the quartet consists of violinists Daniel Chong and Ying Xue, violist Jessica Bodner, and cellist Kee-Hyun Kim. The Crimson had a chance to interview Daniel Chong about his career with the quartet. The Parker Quartet will present its first concert as Blodgett Artists-in-Residence on Friday, Sept. 26 at 8 p.m. in the John Knowles Paine Concert Hall.
The Harvard Crimson: This is your first year here at Harvard. How has it been so far?
Daniel Chong: We're here full-time, teaching the Music 189 chamber music course. It's incredibly exciting to hear and get to know students that are involved in music because, obviously, Harvard College is very different than traditional music conservatories in that people have wide-ranging interests and are so talented in so many different ways.
THC: You are performing next Friday night here at Harvard. Could you talk a bit about what you're playing?
DC: In the center of our program is Henri Dutilleux's “Ainsi la nuit.” It's easy to understand what the main influence is—the night. But it wasn't Dutilleux's intention to create a clear canvas of this singular theme. He said that this piece captures the many moods of the night. If you take one aspect of the night, like the aspect of darkness, and think about how darkness can appear in our lives so differently—you know, we've all experienced fear in darkness, but we also experience extreme comfort—for example, we sleep at night, when we are at our most resigned. Or, if you're out in the darkness in the woods at night, you experience the power of not just what's around you, but also of the whole planet, something sublime and universal.
 
THC: Some people say that these modern compositions are less accessible to the public than Haydn, Beethoven, Dvořák, while others say that they can speak more directly to people and get a more visceral reaction. What do you think about when you're programming concerts with modern works?
 
DC: We try to incorporate a lot of different periods in our programs…because we want to…keep music on its path of evolution. It is true that works of the modern era are more abstract, but you have to remember that when Beethoven wrote his late quartet[s] people thought the music was just crazy and wild and unappreciable; now people listen to late Beethoven very easily. The other idea is that it's not only a different time period: it's a completely different aesthetic, like modern art compared to classical or romantic art. I think the difficult thing is that music is dependent on time. After glancing at visual art, you can just walk away with the general idea very quickly, but in music it's very important to sit through it and get the clearest picture.
THC: Like you're viewing an image piece-by-piece.
DC: Exactly. And the brain is an extraordinary thing and Dutilleux really takes advantage of that—Dutilleux was very influenced by Marcel Proust's theory on memory, and he incorporates this by both recalling past motifs but also foreshadowing future ones in short passages between movements, all interplaying within this singular journey.
THC: In the quartet, how did your relationships with one another change over time?
DC: Being in a string quartet is very intense. Not only are we constantly working together, we are forced to evolve together in ways that don't involve music—we are traveling together, eating together, having administrative meetings…I would say our relationship is most similar to being in a family. In a family dynamic, the connections can take many forms, including friendship and frustration, or knowing each other so well it's beyond a friendship.
THC: What do you see in the future of classical music?
DC: We live in a time where because of the internet and technology in general, young people are encouraged to try so many new things, and music is one of those things that is accessible in a way that it really wasn't 50 years ago. So you see a lot of people connected to music in a firsthand way, which is a really good thing. Classical musicians believe that great music will always want to be played and heard. I think people are reinventing classical music and how it's exposed to people. The younger generation is more interested in classical music than most people think they are, and while that may not necessarily materialize into walking into a concert hall, the curiosity is there.
THC: Any advice for the plethora of musicians here at Harvard?
DC: Remember that music is a lifelong pursuit. It's a craft that needs to be honed for the rest of your life. Always enjoy that path of learning and exploration because [music] is such an incredible art form.

Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, a public park famous for its “living collection” of almost 15 thousand plant specimens and one of the University’s most comprehensive “en plein air” scientific research facilities, is also fertile ground for local artistic expression. “Artists in the Arboretum,” on display at the park’s Hunnewell building through Oct. 19, showcases the work of 27 local artists with personal relationships to the park. The strength of this exhibition lies in its ability to be viewed piece by piece, as an array of discrete intricate dialogues between artist and nature, and as a single vibrant, polyphonic homage to the park that inspired them.
Carefully crafted in media as far-ranging as watercolor and handmade paper, each piece explores an artist’s distinct story with the park. Jason Peter Williams’s pieces consist of rapid, gestural pastel drawings of his favorite locations in the Arboretum, such as Bussey Brook. “I drew it in the four seasons,” Williams says of his drawing of the brook. “I never tired of the spot—every time it was an entirely new piece.” Although Williams has made pastels of other parts of Boston, such as Weeks Bridge in Cambridge, he does not consider himself an urban artist due to his relationship with the Arboretum. “When you come [to the Arboretum] you are no longer in the city,” he says. “You cannot hear a single motor. With the Arboretum I can still be considered an artist who just draws nature.”
For Susan Hardy-Brown, curatorial assistant and former worker at the Cultivated Herbarium, her piece tells the story of her professional relationship to the Arboretum. At a cursory glance, her piece looks like an amalgam of recycled paper, pine needles, and string. In truth, however, each component symbolizes a part of her past as a worker at the park. At the piece’s base is a relief map of Hemlock Hill, a favorite of many visitors, known for its spectacular views of the park’s 281 acres of land. The second layer is a delicate overlay of handmade paper, which she intentionally thinned to a transparent membrane at certain areas to expose parts of the map. One of these is exposed areas is printed with tiny numbers, the accession numbers of the trees from which Brown collected samples as a worker in the Herbarium.
Just as meticulous as the pieces themselves is their strategic arrangement around the room. As Arboretum volunteer interpreter Patricia Cohens puts it, “The pieces speak to each other. It’s important for each piece to have a chance, but also for them to interact with each other to make an interesting combination.” Some successful strategies include putting a brightly colored painting of a flower on a little wall panel perpendicular to a black-and-white photograph of an acorn, which enabled the viewer to enjoy each piece in isolation.
In other cases, this disparity has a complementary effect, enabling contrasting pieces to work harmoniously together. For example, Brown’s piece is placed adjacent to a piece by head arborist John DelRosso, a hiking stick on which was inscribed the quote, “In every walk with nature man receives more than he seeks.” The hiking stick can be seen as a silent allusion to the hiking trails visible on the map portion of Brown’s work, a duet which bridges two very different experiences with the Arboretum. Such fluidity between the pieces forms the pith of the exhibition. As Brown puts it, in the end, all pieces—and the artists themselves—share the purpose of “bring[ing] people here and celebrat[ing] such a variety of expression that is all tied to a single wonderful location: the Arnold Arboretum.”

The words loom in the air with the weight of anxiety and the promise of prosperity: consulting, finance, investment banking. Among senior circles, they’re rattled off in quick succession like machine gun bullets. They supersede normal discussions of things like class, friends, or family. To me, though, they’re entirely foreign.
For as long as I can remember, I’ve wanted to be a writer and to work with literature. I’ve remained fairly confident in this decision over the years, pursuing an English major despite a consistent onslaught of questions about career stability and my capacity to provide for myself in the future. It would take a powerful force to rattle my plans at this life stage.
But I have to admit, I’m rattled.
All this talk around campus about recruiting, career fairs, and OCI interviews has me diagnosing myself with a fatal case of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). I usually contract this disease on Saturday nights, when the only consequence is that my face fails to make it into a briefly circulated Instagram photo, but in this case the stakes have presented themselves as a jobless, penniless existence. I realize that this is an exaggeration, but my anxiety is not entirely unfounded. In fact, I’ve ascertained that it boils down to two key factors (I won’t include salary among them, although I wouldn’t mind a hefty addition to my bank account).
First, consulting and finance provide a clearly lit path to success that is actually facilitated by the Harvard administration. As a self-professed obsessive planner and stickler for organization, this sense of structure offers an immense appeal. My current job application process, on the other hand, has consisted of sending out resumes into the nebulous vortex of the Internet based on a few postings I found on a random, outdated website. Not exactly a recipe for job security.
Second, consulting and finance firms actively pursue new hires as opposed to publishing houses or magazines, where you’re lucky if you get a confirmation email. In my brief stint in the working world, I’ve come to realize that the career search is very much like dating, and it doesn’t feel good to be the one who’s more invested in the relationship. Consulting and finance firms make you feel as if selecting a job is a reciprocal endeavor.
What this all suggests is that the path to a career in the humanities is in need of a serious overhaul, one which includes the sorts of luxuries offered by finance and consulting firms. I, for one, long for the opportunity to meet with potential employers in a formal setting on campus instead of stalking haphazardly selected employee profiles on LinkedIn. But I know I must realize that just because an opportunity is accessible or streamlined doesn’t necessarily mean it suits me best.
Try as I might to convince myself that I could enjoy being an investment banker or business analyst, I am and will always be a writer and editor at heart. That may mean graduating without knowing where I will be employed, or if I’ll be employed at all. That may also mean accepting a less-than-desirable entry-level position in order to work my way to the top. But it does mean that I can go to work every day knowing that I love what I do, and that every hour I spend working overtime or grinding away to meet a tough deadline will be done in the service of something about which I am truly passionate.
So as many of my fellow seniors await a series of offers and interviews this fall, I am fully prepared to be their cheerleader, relishing their successes and the wonderful things they will go on to accomplish. Meanwhile, I will continue to send my resume into oblivion and frantically call friends of friends, looking for insider tips on job openings. Perhaps I’ll even start a humanities support group for those who find themselves in a similar position. And then one day, with a bit of luck and a sufficient amount of effort, I will finally join the ranks of the working class, contented by the fact that I am paid to do the very thing that I choose to do for fun.

Never—not when we asked students to abstain from voting in the Undergraduate Council presidential elections nor when we forecasted the council’s continuing irrelevance—did we think we would come to appreciate a body that was seemingly incapable of effecting change or inspiring student support. And yet this year, things are different.
Last week, 103 undergraduates hit the campaign trail in pursuit of a spot on the UC—a spot coveted by 20 percent more than a year ago and the most desired in three years. This spike in numbers also comes with a spike in the UC’s profile on campus. Under the leadership of UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the council has made an increased effort to engage with students through a variety of methods, including holding office hours, sending emails filled with gifs and memes, and dressing up in Napoleonic garb.
We are pleased to see the UC at least somewhat transformed. It may seem counterproductive to joke about the council’s ability to influence operations at the College. But when joking is mixed with substantive change—like the integration of CharlieCards and HUIDS, which Mayopoulos and Goffard have worked to roll out this fall—there is little harm in humor. This is especially true when that humor serves to inspire more students to run for and engage with the council.
We are excited to see what the new UC will accomplish, and we have no reason not to expect a good run ahead. We only worry because the UC's recent surge in total candidates coincides with a four-year low in female candidates. Only one in four candidates was a woman, and women now constitue only about 30 percent of those at the helm.
In the coming year, we look forward to continued efforts to address the bread and butter issues at stake at Harvard, along with longer term groundwork to fix graver problems—among them the underfunding of student groups and the College’s sexual assault policy. We do not relish a return to the days of lofty promises and minimal progress. But perhaps most importantly, when Election Day rolls around again, we would like to see a more balanced ballot and ultimately Council. The UC’s views are best informed and mean the most when all students are equally represented.
We hope that the 44 recently elected council members will continue down the path Mayopoulos and Goffard have begun to tread. Against all odds, the UC has shed its former image of bureaucratic uselessness and taken up a new mantle. It’s not a joke—but it isn’t afraid of one, either.

Now I walk in beauty
Beauty is before me
Beauty is behind me
Above me and below me
Around me and within me
—Traditional Navajo Spiritual
Before I went back to school this year, I cleaned up the desktop of my computer. Pre-purge, my computer desktop was a scary place. Folders and rogue documents were splattered all over the screen, tragically obscuring the elephant wallpaper I had so carefully downloaded from National Geographic’s website. High school assignments still lurked in the corners of my screen, wedged between embarrassingly funny lolcatz screenshots from 2010.
It felt great to come to school with an empty desktop. But, within a week of being back at school, miscellaneous items once again began to invade my pristine screen.
Sometimes, I go through phases where I try to fool myself into believing that my time here at school runs like a well-oiled machine. I add things to my Google calendar and filter my Gmail inbox like all the cool kids. Things are great, right? But my desktop never lies, and I’ve decided that I’m going to have to start learning how to live without seeing all that National Geographic has to offer.
It was a tradition at my high school to gather and sing a Navajo prayer at the school Thanksgiving assembly every fall. “Now I walk in beauty,” we sang. The prayer insists that beauty is before us, behind us, above, below, around, and within us. In other words, it’s everywhere. Beauty hides behind the folder titled “Random” on my desktop. It lurks between the punctuation marks of that one email to which we haven’t responded for an awkwardly long time.
I sometimes have this idea that I need to get my life in order before I can afford myself the enjoyment of living it. I trick myself into believing that it’s okay to be spending this time figuring out who I want to be instead of just being the way I am now. But, amidst this Chaos of Figuring Out exists the beauty of our present experience. As Dean Khurana stressed in his speech to freshmen at this year’s Convocation, college isn’t just our preparation for life after college. College is also life.
I don’t necessarily believe happiness to be a choice: After all, sometimes it just isn’t. However, I do insist that there is an art to our experience worth relishing. So, I resolve to walk in beauty, even when I am blinded by the glare in the Science Center Plaza.
I took a class last year on classical Sanskrit literature in which we discussed the concept of rasa, an aestheticized emotion. I am still no Sanskritist, but my understanding is that rasa is like a universalized form of a specific emotion. My professor compared it to the feeling one gets while watching a tragic movie. First, one may feel sad for the specific characters in the movie. But, some viewers may experience a broader sort of Sadness, a feeling that makes one feel so universally human that it causes a sort of bliss. That viewer may think, “I am a human, and I feel sad. And that makes me feel connected to the world.” This large Sadness becomes an emotion worth relishing.
I want this column to be an exploration of how to relish the right now. We have been given a gift here, but we are often so stressed out about how to make the most of it that we miss the mark. Not everything about this place is rosy and perfect, and we must think critically about our time here and what it means. Dialogue is necessary to address some of the structural, institutional, and cultural barriers that impede our development here at Harvard as individuals and as a community. But, we must also relish the beauty around and within us. We can experience all of this with messy desktops, while we sprint to section, and as we scrape the very last bits of peanut butter out of the jar at Brain Break.
Let’s prove to Deresiewicz that we have souls.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the age of 10, I started performing in school plays and going to drama camps over the summer. While my passion for theater took a nosedive once I hit high school and discovered I lacked any hint of talent, at the time, my parents and teachers fed my young ego by telling me I was an amazing actress.
Yet despite my budding ambitions, I was often put off by that compliment. I wanted to be an actor, not an actress. To me, an actor was a person who acts in plays, while an actress was a female version of that thing. I didn’t want to be a female version; I wanted to be the real thing.
I wasn’t far off. A quick dictionary search for the terms actor and actress yields definitions, respectively, of “one who represents a character in a dramatic production,” and, “a female actor.” Men or women can be called actors, but only women are actresses: Actor is the default, and actress is the female version.
Simone de Beauvoir got it right when she wrote in The Second Sex: “Man is defined as a human being and a woman as a female.” We see women as the other: Instead of being two equal and opposite halves of humanity, men are the default humans, and women are a secondary version of that norm. Even before I could articulate the problem as a young, aspiring actor, I could feel its truth.
Gendered job titles strangely persist: Words like “waitress” and “stewardess” are remnants of an age when we also used the terms “authoress” and “lady judge” to delegate female professionals to a secondary version of all jobs. And while “actress” may need to stick around for the Academy to properly categorize awards, I’m all for switching to gender-neutral terms like “firefighter, and “mail carrier” in lieu of “fireman” and “mailman.” And I think it’s great that Fed chair Janet Yellen asked her staff to call her “chair” instead of “chairwoman.”
It’s not just job titles—the status of males as the default is also particularly apparent in pop culture. Anita Sarkeesian’s video series “Tropes vs. Women in Video Games” discusses the concept of a Ms. Male Character, who is “a female version of an already established or default male character” (think Minnie Mouse or Ms. Pac-man), as well as the closely connected Smurfette Principle, wherein a single female character (like Smurfette of the Smurfs series or Kanga in Winnie the Pooh) exists in a world that is otherwise entirely male.   Both phenomena reinforce the idea that characters are always male unless specifically identified otherwise— typically via the addition of a hair bow or pink outfit. Pac-man doesn’t look particularly male, but he’s male by default.
The Bechdel Test reveals a similar phenomenon in mainstream movies: Far too many films don’t meet the simple requirement that two female characters speak to one another about something other than a man. In films, as in cartoons and video games, men are largely the default characters and women only exist to serve uniquely female roles—which in this case involves talking to or about men.
These pop culture trends are just exaggerated reflections of the way we still think about women in society. It happens when we automatically say “he” when referring to an anonymous, genderless, hypothetical person. It’s present in the male and female symbols we use on bathroom doors: The “men” symbol is a basic human figure, and the “women” symbol has an extra skirt added on to differentiate her as female and different from the norm. (Don’t believe me? Then why do the genderless handicap signs or crosswalk signs also resemble the male bathroom sign?) It happens when companies market pink “girl versions” of products that should have been gender-neutral in the first place.
Sure, there are all sorts of pressing feminist issues that are far less subtle. Yet the fact that women are treated as deviations from the norm means that even independent of any policy issues, the way we think about gender is messed up. It shows that even though women have important legal rights, we still need feminism.
While anti-feminists argue that men and women are different and that’s a good thing, the problem is not with the fact that there’s a distinction, but rather with how that distinction is drawn. I’m fine with being different from men in certain ways, but I am not a female version of an otherwise normal human being.

My experience as a D1 athlete didn’t start with free Nikes. When I arrived on campus for the first time, my new coach led me past the stately brick-and-ivy football building and the track, off the athletic campus, and to the school’s recycling warehouse, where Harvard’s varsity ski team is based. He opened the door to reveal a tiny room cluttered with ski waxing benches, oversized duffels, rainbow clusters of racing skis, and scattered posters of Olympic skiers peeling off the stark white walls. I could tell right away that this wasn’t the latest in ski technology: this was a home.
As I think Drew Faust told us during an Opening Days speech (while I daydreamed about brunch), a liberal arts education is about being immersed in a variety of subjects and activities, exploring new avenues of thought, and finding things that I’m passionate about to build my future around. When I get asked what I plan to do with my English degree, I can come up with some rough answers, like journalism, publishing, or sleeping on a futon in my parents’ basement, but I’ve never been able to explain why I ski besides the weak note of “I love/like it.” Skiing could never be represented on a résumé; it can hardly go into words: the euphoria of cresting a hill with lactic acid burning in my legs, the swift rushes of biting-cold air that whistle past my ears as I tuck down the next hill—it’s a “you had to be there” thing to the extreme. It’s an addiction. It’s incredible.
Why do I ever need to explain why I ski? It seems that the idea of exploration that’s at the heart of a liberal arts education is a two-sided coin. We’re told to seek new passions, but enough of them (and sufficiently highbrow ones) to please the looming shadows of our grad- and med-school admissions counselors, our future employers, or our own parents, who can range from supportive-but-confused to intimidating and overbearing. It took me far too long to realize that the kid in Annenberg who lists off all 12 of her clubs might just feel that these commitments are what make her education worthwhile, or, scarier, what give her personal worth.
I spent the past summer working at home, and, though I love my hometown and family, I repeatedly felt that I was doing something wrong: I should be somewhere else doing a harder job that would help me more in the future. I must not be involved or accomplished enough at school, and skiing, my weightiest and seemingly most random extracurricular, must be the culprit. As I sweated through running workouts and the Harvard weight room’s take-home lifting plan, I did the unthinkable. After 15 years, I questioned why I skied, and I couldn’t seem to find an answer.
Skiing did not get me admitted into college, nor was it the source of my financial aid. It probably won’t help me find a writing job when I graduate. I could pull out the shifty claim that skiing was the lone factor that taught me to be self-disciplined and work hard, but I also have my parents and teachers to thank for that one. Skiing does keep me from getting fat, but a healthy physique and varsity status are far from mutually exclusive—there are easier ways to stay fit than a racing sport.
Last summer, as I asked myself why I skied, I eventually cycled out of frustration and found my answer in the tiny places where I wasn’t looking: in the rustles of coniferous boughs above my head during a trail run, in the stillness of the water during an early-morning rowing workout, in the satisfaction of sitting down to a hot breakfast after a morning lift. I love skiing because I LOVE it. It brings me peace and gives me a chance to be strong and graceful, and that will always be enough of an answer to get me out of bed and into running shorts or Harvard Skiing’s signature full-body red spandex. Leaving campus for snowy Vermont on the weekend with my 12 best friends is consistently refreshing, a great reminder that the worth of my college experience could never be summated in red ink in the margins of a paper. The people I respect most aren’t the ones with the most accolades or financial security; they’re the ones who do something with a determination and passion that radiates out of their work, be it a novel, medical research, or a first-place finish by a split second.
As an English concentrator, I am officially here to say that there is no symbolism whatsoever behind my status as a varsity skier and that I’m not particularly concerned about how it will play into the other parts of my life’s plot. I’m sure it will, though, and I’m excited to see how.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s endowment returned 15.4 percent and grew to $36.4 billion in fiscal year 2014 but, as in recent years, the investment performance of Harvard Management Company lagged behind that of some of the University’s peer institutions.
The investment gains leave Harvard’s endowment just short of its $36.9 billion peak, which was reached in June of 2008, before the endowment lost nearly $11 billion in value during a global financial crisis.
While most of Harvard’s peer institutions have yet to release their returns for FY 2014, three peer schools have outpaced Harvard by upwards of two percentage points. MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, and Dartmouth saw gains of 19.2, 17.5, and 19.2 percent, respectively.
FY 2014 marked the fifth straight year that HMC beat its internally set Policy Portfolio benchmark. HMC exceeded this measure in FY 2014 by .8 percent, which is the lowest margin by which it has done so in the past five years. At the same time, it was a strong year for major markets, including for the Standard and Poors 500, which was up 24.6 percent.
In FY 2013, the endowment returned 11.3 percent. Since the financial crisis, cooperation between HMC and the Harvard Corporation—the 13-member body that essentially serves as Harvard’s board of trustees—has been tightened and a new and more conservative investment mandate for HMC has emerged.
Management Company CEO Jane L. Mendillo, who said this summer that she will step down by the end of December, would not agree to be interviewed on-the-record Tuesday afternoon.
But in the report and a press release that accompanied it, Mendillo characterized the year positively.
“The last five years have been a period of significant recovery and repositioning for the Harvard endowment,” Mendillo wrote. “Our organization and our portfolio are now well positioned to continue to deliver substantial returns and cash flow to the University for decades to come.”
According to the report, HMC experienced relatively strong returns in most asset classes. Public and private equities were the only two asset classes to have fallen short of the internally set benchmarks, by .9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.
The relatively weak performance in public equities stems from HMC’s performance in foreign equity, where it underperformed against its benchmark by 4.1 percent, and emerging markets equity, where it just met its benchmark.
But domestic equity made up for some of the losses in public equities. This year was the 20th in a row in which HMC’s domestic public equity portfolio beat the U.S. equity market. Mendillo called HMC’s 1.1 percent relative return in U.S. equities, compared to the Company’s internal benchmark, a “nice margin, given the challenge of outperforming a roaring market.”
The relatively weak performance of private equity this year continues the recent sluggish trend for an asset class that had previously driven much of the endowment’s growth. Private equity saw annualized returns of over 30 percent between 1997 and 2007, far outpacing the slightly more than 10 percent annualized returns for private equity over the past decade. Private equity is also the only asset class in the past few years that did not meet its internal benchmark, falling short by more than 2 percentage points.
Yet Mendillo said in this year’s report that much of the disappointing growth can be attributed to specific commitments made between 2004-2008 in the pre-crisis era, which currently account for 73 percent of the private equity portfolio and are “substantially underperforming.”
As these positions presumably begin to unwind in the next few years, HMC plans to increase its allocation to this asset class even more, according to the report. Its targeted allocation for private equity for 2015 is now 18 percent, 7 percentage points higher than it was six years ago and the largest of any other single asset class in the portfolio.
Harvard has experienced an outflow this year of some of its top-level financial leaders from across the University. In addition to the impending departure of Mendillo, Chief Financial Officer Dan F. Shore and Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 announced they would be leaving.

UPDATED: Sept. 23, 2014, at 9:15 p.m.
Four dozen college students from across the country will convene at the Institute of Politics this weekend to receive training in bipartisan political collaboration.
During a conference entitled “Bipartisan Advocacy: Finding Common Ground,” the visiting students will discuss projects concerning policy issues on college campuses and in their local communities.
In addition, the conference will feature high-profile speakers and experts on bipartisanism, including former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan R. Glickman, who also served as director of the IOP from 2002-2004.
The conference participants come from schools involved in the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement, a consortium of 25 colleges, founded at Harvard in 2003, dedicated to engaging students in public service.
Glickman explained the need for the conference given the contemporary political culture.
“We probably have the smartest group of students we’ve ever had in the history of our country,” Glickman said. “But overall, they’re the most politically disengaged students we’ve ever had.”
Laura J. Simolaris, director of the National Campaign, said the emphasis on students’ personal, long-term projects sets this year’s conference apart from those in previous years.
“This is the first time we’ve asked [students] to be responsible for something throughout the year, beyond just the conference,” Simolaris said. “We want them to work with one another, we want to create a community of like-minded college students who are working toward a similar goal and help provide them with resources that can get them to do their jobs better.”
Simolaris said she hopes the conference will inspire students to collaborate with others in their communities.
“We really wanted to balance discussion and opportunity for students to share what they’re doing, to hear from people who are working in communities already, but also for them to pick up some real skills that they can use in their efforts, both on campus and after,” Simolaris said.
Niyat Mulugheta ’16, student chair of the National Campaign committee, referred to the attending students as “the next political leaders of our country” and expressed excitement at the prospect of “trying to put together a coordinated national effort toward bipartisanship and coming together and getting things done, unlike the people that are in office right now.”

The Ebola virus could have an exponentially more disastrous effect on West Africa if the international community does not act soon, an interdisciplinary panel of experts warned at an event in the Barker Center Tuesday.
The event, sponsored by the Committee on African Studies, was aimed at raising awareness of the deadly toll of the Ebola outbreak in west African nations like Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, according to Susan E. Cook, executive director of the Committee.
“We felt like this thing is a huge issue, and not a lot of people understand this,” Cook said. “It’s really, really important that, as Harvard, we give it its due attention.”
Given the interdisciplinary nature of the panel, Cook said, the discussion helped shed light on the complex issue of Ebola from multiple perspectives.
“I had chills sitting here realizing that these people don’t otherwise get to talk to one another; they don’t otherwise get to learn from one another,” Cook said of the panelists.
Patrick Vinck, a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the response to the outbreak could be complicated by the fact that many West African residents are wary of outside officials coming in and instructing them on how to respond to the outbreak, even if they have good intentions.
“That relationship between the health sector and the people [of West Africa] is not as well established as it is in dealing with the Church, for example,” Vinck said.
Maggie Koerth-Baker, another panelist and a columnist for The New York Times Magazine, said the media response to the outbreak has been subpar.
“We’re making all of our stories based on our assumptions of what the story already is, instead of finding out what the story is,” Koerth-Baker said.
Kristian G. Andersen, a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Center for Systems Biology, said he travelled to Guinea as soon as he heard Ebola had been confirmed there. Even after the current outbreak subsides, it is essential to improve health infrastructure in West Africa to prevent similar outbreaks in the future, Andersen said.
“Once it ends, we can’t just leave and say, ‘We solved Ebola,' because Ebola is now in the region," Anderson said. "It will happen again, and the next time, we need to be able to stop it at the first case.”

Dozens of freshmen gathered in the basement of Grays Hall on Tuesday night to celebrate the opening of the Serenity Room, a space created to help address stress on campus, with fresh fruit and free massages.
The space, which will be open 24 hours a day, is the first of its kind in the Yard, modeled after similar rooms devoted to relaxation in several of the upperclassman Houses.
The creation of the room, spearheaded by the Freshman Dean’s Office with the assistance of a grant from the Dean of the College, was a response to a recent report on the sources and levels of stress on campus, according to Elm Yard Resident Dean Jasmine M. Waddell.
“We’re really excited because this room responds directly to some of the recommendations that came out of that stress report, and we were able to do it very quickly,” Waddell said, noting that the project was initially conceptualized last spring.
Calling the room a “public health intervention,” Waddell said that the FDO collaborated with the Center for Wellness at University Health Services to ensure that the space is equipped to aid stressed students.
At the opening, students were invited to take off their shoes at the door and enjoy the newly redone space, equipped with pillows, chairs, and directions for self-guided meditation. Director of the Center for Wellness Jeanne Mahon led a brief guided meditation session during the opening event, the first in a planned series of similar sessions at the space.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 introduced students to the space on Tuesday and voiced his hope that students would play an integral role in shaping the programming offered in the Serenity Room.
“We are aware of how quickly freshmen often find themselves overcommitted,” Dingman said, adding that he hopes the room will serve as a space for students to slow down and reflect.
According to Waddell, the room is wheelchair-accessible and will remain open all day as an alternative to other options for relaxation, such as study breaks, which occur at designated times.
Paul G. Stainier ’18, who attended the opening of the Serenity Room, said he was enthusiastic about the opening of the space and noted that students seem particularly busy at this point in the semester.
“Having a space to just relax and where the conversation isn’t centered around how stressed you are is really important,” he said.

Spurred by a desire to control Pacific Ocean territory, some east Asian countries are laying claim to disputed islands far off their coasts, said historian Alexis Dudden at a seminar Tuesday evening.
Dudden, a professor of history at the University of Connecticut, spoke about what she calls “ocean imperialism,” the race to become a maritime power. The seminar, entitled “Japan’s Trouble With Islands: Law, Territory, and History,” drew an audience of about 60 people to the CGIS-Knafel building.
“A new era of ocean imperialism is transforming islands everywhere into objects that contain the seas, rather than the other way around,” she said. According to Dudden, China, Japan, and South Korea are hoping to find resources on the seafloor surrounding their island territories.
The conflict is a fairly recent development. According to Dudden, territorial disputes were rare before 2006, as most ocean floor explorations were conducted jointly. Taiwan, she said, was the only island that incited a sovereignty debate at the time.
New ocean laws, however, now allow countries to lay claim to the ocean floor beneath their territory. The possibility of controlling the seabed beneath the islands in the East China Sea has ignited territorial conflicts. Moreover, democratization in China, Japan, and South Korea has helped spark widespread interest for these issues among everyday citizens, rather than politicians alone, Dudden said.
The islands, she added, have a contested history. The Senkaku Islands, for example, have appeared on both Japanese and Chinese maps, and recently became a focal point of territorial conflict between China and Japan. According to Dudden, Japan, despite its claims on the islands, has a weak historical case for owning them.
Some audience members contested her arguments. Tsutomu Himeno, consul general of Japan in Boston, posed a question, suggesting that the debate over the islands is not about imperialism but about protecting Japanese territory.
“We are making sure our territories, according to international law and history, are recognized,” he said.

Dartmouth Medical School professor James L. Bernat and Harvard Medical School professor Robert D. Truog argued for a change in vital organ donation guidelines on both academic and practical grounds Tuesday afternoon.
At the discussion, “Dead Donor Rule and Future of Organ Transplantation,” Truog advocated that patients need not necessarily be dead before their vital organs are removed for donation. The discussion, which was moderated by Dr. Lisa Lehmann of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, drew around 40 attendees.
According to Bernat, the dead donor rule, which states that vital organ donors must be dead, is the ethical and legal foundation of organ donation. Bernat questioned the observance of the rule in cases of donation after circulatory determination of death. In these cases, patients are declared dead after permanent cessation of circulatory function, which is usually determined by failed CPR attempts. However, auto-resuscitation and recovery may occur up to seven minutes after CPR is abandoned, he said, adding that death should not only depend on physician volition.
Truog argued for the abandonment of the dead donor rule by defining death as the permanent loss of consciousness. With this perspective, brain-dead patients who are still alive as determined by the circulatory-respiratory criterion may qualify as multi-organ donors. He suggested the possibility of organ donation under anesthesia provided that the patient is “permanently unconscious or imminently dying.”
Such an alternative, as controversial as it may seem, presents the advantages of increasing the donor pool and maximizing the quality of organs obtained, Truog said. There is permanent damage inflicted to organs when circulatory function ceases, so the option of operating on donors while they are alive is attractive, he added.
The floor was filled with questions following Truog’s proposition. Both speakers said that the future of death determination for organ donation should be a policy decision made by the public.

Prospective travelers may now think twice before jumping on Kayak or Expedia. Villy, a new kind of travel booking website created by two Business School students, relies on location preferences, rather than price alone, to tailor travel plans.
The site, which was founded by Business School students Rami A. B. Lachter and Itai Turbahn through the Harvard Innovation Lab’s Venture Incubation Program, launched last week and has generated traffic from users across 100 countries.
Villy, which is a play on the French word “ville,” serves ten cities, including Berlin and Bangkok. It guides users through a series of choices, asking them where they want to go and what they are interested in doing during their visit, as well as how much they plan to pay and the number of people in their traveling group.
The platform then generates a list of neighborhoods that best align with those preferences, utilizing information from locals—a feature unique to Villy—along with objective data based on hotel rates and reviews from TripAdvisor and Expedia.
“Everybody likes traveling, but finding where to stay is very frustrating,” Lachter said, adding that traditional booking websites usually do not prioritize hotel location over price. While the Internet has become the major medium for planning trips, prospective travelers can be overwhelmed by the plethora of travel websites claiming to have the best deals, he added.
In a 2012 survey by the I.B.M. Institute for Business Value, 20 percent of travelers reported spending five hours or more booking travel online. Nearly half said that planning their travels required more than two hours.
“The planning process still is really inefficient,” said Patrick A. Kinsel, who mentored the pair at the i-lab last spring. He added that the search for hotels is so driven by price that travelers end up booking accommodation in neighborhoods that may not suit their interests.
Last February, Villy was accepted into the Venture Incubation Program, where teams share their ideas, get feedback from industry specialists and experts, and receive a mentor for long-term guidance beyond the 12-week program.
Villy stands out from other travel websites due to its “community of experts that is incentivized to share experiences and make recommendations,” said Turbahn, a designer and developer who has researched crowdsourcing and incentivization strategies. Each expert is native to one of the ten cities served by the site, recognizing which neighborhoods are best for different activities.
In the immediate future, Lachter and Turbahn are looking to add members to the team and start hiring locals beyond those known through their personal networks. While Americans and young people generated most of the traffic to the site during its first week, the team hopes to cultivate an international audience. They are also planning to expand to two additional cities.
“When I meet any team, I’m always skeptical of whether they can deliver on the product,” Kinsel said. “These guys have built a beautiful travel space.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Astronomy department chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb presented cutting-edge techniques in the search for primitive and intelligent life Tuesday evening. Speaking to a room of about 200 people, Loeb introduced several methods used to answer the unsolved question of whether forms of life exist beyond Earth.
One way to answer that question is to locate extraterrestrial life by searching for artificial light on planets, Loeb said. However, as these planets are all orbiting stars, Loeb said, “you get blinded from the light that comes from a star."
This means that cosmologists must effectively block out the light from the neighboring sun in order to see artificial light, according to Loeb. In response, cosmologists have built starshades—large instruments that resemble tents—with specifically shaped apertures that block out light from stars while allowing light from the planet.
Another method discussed by Loeb is to search for biomarkers with large-scale telescopes, defined as those 24-39 meters in size. Harvard is sponsoring the construction of one such telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope. Telescopes like the GMT have increased ability to detect biological particles on distant planets.
“The best instrument to use would be the James Webb Space Telescope," Loeb said. NASA's JWST is set to launch in October 2018 and is expected to be one of the most advanced telescopes in the current technological arsenal. As it is especially sensitive to infrared rays, Loeb expressed hope that the JWST will finally capture evidence of extraterrestrial life.
Another technique is to seek evidence of industrial pollution in the atmosphere of other planets, which Loeb said is a key characteristic unique to inhabited planets. Some may argue that pollution indicates the existence of an unintelligent life form because it shows that the species does not know how to take care of the planet. However, according to Loeb, industrial pollution may not be a negative characteristic because it may help the planet stay warm. Therefore, industrial pollution may still be indicative of a highly intelligent species.
Despite current technological progress, Loeb said, “there are some blank pages in the photo album of the universe." There is a rush to locate extraterrestrial life because as the universe begins to expand at an increasing speed, it will become more difficult to detect even the faintest traces of other galaxies, he said.

Over a month after Harvard banned the use of all forms of tobacco in the Yard, Harvard staff and students said that the implementation of the ban has been smooth, with its impact localized to a few areas.
According to Maureen McCarthy, manager of Harvard Yard and the freshman dormitories, the University has been enforcing the smoking ban similarly to the way it enforces the ban against biking through the Yard. Staff members, including members of Securitas and Yard Operations, approach smokers and ask them to either desist or leave the Yard.
McCarthy said she has not heard any reports about hostile or uncooperative responses from either students or tourists.
“We’re not really aggressively implementing it, but people slowly learn that it’s a policy, and they get the word out,” she said.
Students interviewed around the Yard this week said that they were aware of the ban and pleased it is in place, though many also noted that they had not found issue with smokers in the Yard before the prohibition was put in place Aug. 15.
“I think it’s probably a good thing, but it’s never been a problem,” Caroline L. Ferguson ’17, a Crimson sports editor, said of the ban. “If I was around people smoking I think it’d probably bother me, but I didn’t notice before that it was [a problem].”
According to McCarthy, although smokers in the Yard were not considered a huge issue before the ban, there were certain locations in the Yard that were popular for smokers. At locations such as Widener Gate, the steps of Lamont Library, and entryway D of Wigglesworth Hall, cigarette butts posed a cleanup problem for landscape maintenance staff members.
According to the University Department of Health Promotion and Education, the ban was put in place “to ensure a safe, healthy environment for people to walk, study, be active, [and] engage with each other.”
Student smokers interviewed for this story said that the ban has made smoking more inconvenient and prompted them to change where they smoke, but it has not promoted any broad lifestyle changes.
“Every time I feel like I need to smoke, I have to go outside of the Yard. So regardless of the time—even if it’s the middle of the night—I will go to one of the open gates and smoke outside,” said one freshman, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want his family to know that he smokes. He added that if the ban did not exist, he would likely smoke inside the Yard, though in a relatively secluded area.
Although Harvard University Health Services also announced last month that it would strengthen and increase promotion of its tobacco cessation resources for student smokers to complement the policy change, the anonymous freshman said the ban has so far not changed how much he smokes.

With its back against the wall, the Harvard men’s soccer team put together a furious rally Tuesday night. The Crimson scored three goals in under sixteen minutes to get its fourth straight win, 3-2, over Northeastern, capped by a sizzling volley from junior midfielder Andrew Chang with 43 seconds left in regulation that caught Huskies goalie Jonathan Thuresson flat-footed.
“I thought that as a team we just kept pushing and never gave up,” Chang said. “We worked hard. We know what we are good at and we just continued to do that.”
Harvard fell behind 2-0 with 20 minutes to play when Northeastern forward Frantzdy Pierrot finished a give-and-go with teammate Christian McKenna by blasting a shot off a Crimson defender and past junior goalkeeper Evan Mendez.
At that point, Harvard had outshot Northeastern 14-12 but had not seriously challenged Thuresson since junior Oliver White missed a point-blank shot in the 30th minute, one-touching a shot just right of an open net.
On this night, however, the Crimson was not to be turned back.
Coach Pieter Lehrer pulled junior co-captain Mark Ashby from the pitch following the goal, putting in Chang. The switch put a significantly more offensive unit on the field, and Harvard swiftly took advantage of its new lineup.
After pressing the ball upfield, junior Michael Klain launched a throw-in towards the box, finding 6’6” junior midfielder Tim Schmoll.
Schmoll struggled to corral the ball, sending it towards the back post, where junior midfielder Matt Sheeleigh headed the ball past an oncoming defender and right to sophomore midfielder Andrew Omiunu-Wheeler. The ball never hit the ground as Omiunu-Wheeler headed it into the back of the net, bringing the Crimson within one.
Lehrer immediately brought back Ashby, drawing a corner kick a minute and a half later. Tinkering further to try and make up the extra goal, the coach brought in senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi for Sheeleigh.
The junior rewarded his coach’s faith moments later when he tracked down a flying ball in the right corner of the box and headed a shot over the head of Thuresson. The ball fell softly into the back of the net as the bench erupted.
Down 2-0 just 13 minutes earlier, Harvard was tied.
“I think we really focused on fighting in the box and willing the ball into the goal every time,” Chang said. “We never stopped pushing as a team, and we were in the right spot at the right time.”
However, thoughts of overtime were nearly cut short as Pierrot tore through the Crimson defense 13 seconds later, dishing to teammate Donovan Fayd. Alone at the top of the box, Fayd sailed the kick long.
Back down the field came the Crimson. After a sliding tackle from sophomore forward Daniel Smith stopped a Northeastern three-on-two, a quick series of Harvard passes found White again in front of the goal. His sharp shot was deflected up into the air by Thuresson, coming right to Chang. Without hesitation, the junior struck the ball on its way down, sending a laser past the stunned goalkeeper and putting the bench on its feet.
“This group fights, they have done this in training and everything that they do,” Lehrer said. “They just fight and fight and fight.”
Afterwards, Chang noted the depth on this Crimson squad, which played 18 players on the night, as a reason behind its offensive resurgence.
After not scoring three goals in a game since November 2011, Harvard has done so in four straight games, bookending the streak with 3-2 wins over city rivals Boston College and Northeastern.
In this span, Harvard has scored 13 goals, nearly seven times the amount that it scored in its first three contests and more than it scored in any five-game period in 2013. The Crimson has outscored its opponents by eight goals during this span, bringing its season plus-minus to plus-four.
“A big part of our team that is part of our culture is that we are a team of leaders,” Chang said. “Everyone has the ability to step up in big moments and lead the team.”

Coming off four consecutive wins, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (6-2) will look to maintain momentum in its final non-conference game as it travels north to take on New Hampshire (6-9) Wednesday at Lundholm Gymnasium.
In its last outing on Sunday afternoon, the Crimson defeated Boston College in five sets to cap off an undefeated run through the New England Challenge at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Led by co-captain Caroline Walters’ 14 kills and four blocks and sophomore outside hitter Grace Weghorst’s 13 kills and ten digs, Harvard tied the program’s longest win streak since it won six games in a row in 2008. The team’s 6-2 record marks its strongest start to a season since 1984.
“We’re really excited [about our win streak],” co-captain Kristen Casey said. “We knew we were really talented going into the season, and one thing we’ve focused on is not losing to teams that we shouldn’t be losing to.”
The Wildcats are also coming off a strong performance, winning two of their three matches at the Holly Young Invitational but dropping their final match of the invitational to New Mexico State. Before that, junior right-side hitter Brenna Buckwalter, with 15 kills, and senior setter Taylor Dunklau, who had 49 assists, carried their team to a five-set victory against Rhode Island Saturday afternoon.
“New Hampshire’s an aggressive serving team and offensive team,” coach Jennifer Weiss said. “So…we’re not going to take anything for granted. We [need] to manage the whole pace of the match.”
The strong 6-2 start for the Crimson has overshadowed one area where Harvard has faltered this season—the beginning of sets. In the 19 sets that the team has gone on to win in its first eight games, the team has trailed at the 15-point mark in 11 of those contests.
“We’re trying to be consistent and be intense right when we start that set,” Weiss said. “We’ve been working on that in practice. The more we focus on one at a time, the better.”
When the two teams met last season at the MAC, New Hampshire won after tight five sets—each of which was determined by three points or less. Accruing 14 kills and 18 digs in the match, junior co-captain Tori Forrest led the Wildcats to a 15-13 victory in the deciding set.
A member of last year’s America East All-Conference first team last year, the outside hitter is coming into this match averaging three kills and 2.2 digs per set for New Hampshire.
Two Harvard players who will look to have an impact on this year’s match are Walters and sophomore setter Corinne Bain.
On Tuesday, Walters was named the Sports Imports/AVCA National Player of the Week—the first time an Ivy League woman athlete had earned the honor. The San Mateo, Calif., native was also named the Ivy League Player of the Week. The fourth-year star has recorded averages of 2.4 kills, 0.9 blocks, and 0.6 digs per set thus far this season, and Weiss said she and other veterans have helped the team start fast.
“It’s hard to compare [to last year],” Weiss said. “But this year particularly, our leaders are doing a nice job keeping everything on track.”
This is the second week in a row that a member of the Crimson has won Ivy League Player of the Week honors. Bain received the honor in the week prior for her performance in the Benson Hospitality Invitational.
The second-year player is no stranger to accolades, having won once before in her first year with the team in addition to being named Rookie of the Year last year in the Ivy League. She is averaging 2.4 kills, 6.8 assists, and 2.1 digs per set this season.
This is the last out-of-conference contest for Harvard before it opens up its conference slate with Dartmouth on Saturday.
“Our goal is to win the league, and I think we have a really strong chance,” Casey said. “We have to play every game like it is the Ivy League championship.”

The Harvard men’s basketball team will play seven of its first eight games in the Boston area, according to the 2014-2015 schedule released by Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker on Tuesday. The Crimson will begin its season with MIT at home on Nov. 14 and will not leave Massachusetts for the rest of the month—closing with a marquee home matchup against UMass on Nov. 29.
In December, Harvard will take to the road to play two foes from Big Six conferences—the University of Virginia and Arizona State. The Sun Devils, the Cavaliers, and the Minutemen are the only 2014 NCAA Tournament teams on Harvard’s schedule.
“We have put together a strong non-conference schedule that will help us prepare for the rigors of Ivy League play,” Amaker said in a statement released by the team.
After playing a Dec. 8 home game against Boston University, Harvard will play only two contests at Lavietes Pavilion until a Feb. 13-14 homestand against Columbia and Cornell. The Crimson take the road for five of its first six Ivy League matchups, including a trip to Princeton and Penn during the first weekend of the spring semester.
Harvard will close the season by playing six of its final eight games at Lavietes, where the team has lost just three games over the last three years. After closing the regular season with road games at Yale and Brown in 2014, the Crimson will face the Bulldogs and the Bears at home on Mar. 6-7 to conclude the 2015 season.

A little more than four years after the NCAA announced new rules “requiring each member institution to have a concussion management plan”, the Boston City Council approved further head trauma-oriented safety ordinances last week for individuals competing in NCAA events within city limits. The law is thought to be the first of its kind.
NCAA Division I schools in the vicinity impacted by the new legislation include Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern, as well as each school’s opponents at home games.
Among other provisions, the law requires each affected college to have an emergency medical action plan in place for all events held in Boston. As a part of this plan, athletes are barred from reentering the same game or match after suffering a concussion or displaying concussion-like symptoms that signal a concussion.
Additionally, the city will require a neurotrauma consultant to be on-site for all NCAA Division I football, ice hockey, and men's lacrosse events effective on July 1 of next year, an action inspired by the National Football League’s use of these same experts at its games.
While the newest set of rules may affect other area schools to a greater degree, they figure to make little-to-no difference for Harvard because of the strict policies the Ivy League already in place before the ordinance.
“The practices the regulation asks for have been part of our normal protocol and are consistent with our focus on student health and welfare,” said Tim Williamson, the Harvard Athletics Department communication director, in an emailed statement.
The Ivy League has been a pioneer in the area of head injury legislation for the past few years, with the widespread call for reforms reaching its nadir just after Penn football captain Owen Thomas took his life in April of 2010.
Even before the NCAA enacted its own first major set of head injury reforms in 2010, the Ivy League had begun its research on how to lower the number of collisions in contact sports in 2009 and implemented a new policy for football of limiting full-contact practices during the season from the NCAA maximum of five down to two a week. Similar contact restrictions were rolled out for soccer and lacrosse teams in 2012, with more emphasis on concussion education and prevention introduced as well.
Currently, Harvard conducts a series of tests—both before the season for a baseline test and when a concussion is suspected. The process triggered by concussion-like symptoms involves visiting a team physician, notifying the resident dean for academic accommodation if a concussion is diagnosed, and a group of tests that must be passed before a player is cleared to return.

Welcome back to Listen Up! Your trusted Flyby advisers—two uniquely unqualified, naïve, decidedly uninteresting juniors—are back on campus with the latest advice and invaluable counsel.
Before we begin, we just wanted to clarify to everyone that some questions quite frankly do not belong in an advice column. Oh, we’re not talking about the raunchy (one anon asked about a fantasy they had with a Tasty Burger), or the inane (“I literally do no homework...is that bad?”). We’re talking about questions that have real answers. Questions about how to fill out your fall wardrobe? Yes, yes, yes. Questions about how long summer lasts? No, no, no. (Apparently, scientists haven’t actually figured out how long summer lasts. Current estimates about the length of summer ranges from five seconds to five hundred days.)
How do I ask a girl to dance with me for my friend?
Try words (though not the grammatically incorrect ones you used in asking this question.)Or a scented note.
If you were stuck in a room with a walrus, a giraffe and a pineapple, what would you do?
Be glad that we’re not stuck in a room with whoever wrote this question.
We love youuuuuuu! When are you coming to dc?????
Dear Barack and Michelle,
It’s great to hear from you again. We both have this little thing called college at the moment, but maybe Thanksgiving at the White House? You bring the dance moves, we’ll bring the candied yams.
Oh, and tell Bo we say hi :)
What should I do if my roommate picks her nose?
So many options to choose from:
So I like this guy... we're friends. We have deep meaningful conversations. We have fun. I hang out with him and his friends. Things are progressing nicely, until he goes on a date with some other person. Halp?
Well you could start by not spelling the word “help” with the letter a. That’s just poor personal form and will repel any possible romantic development.
We can already identify the biggest problem in this situation: “I hang out with him and his friends.” Don’t fool yourself and think of this as an asset. When all of you are hanging out, he sees as just one of many amorphous individuals. You want to stand out? Ditch his friends. Drop them like they’re hot (well presumably they’re not hot, or you would be pursuing them).
You seem to also be implying that you’re in some sort of “friend zone.” Prepare yourself because we’re about to drop some quality information into your box of knowledge. The “friend zone” is not a thing. It’s just an excuse to be lazy. Look at all the classic couples throughout history: Jim and Pam, Chandler and Monica, Ron and Hermione. What do they all have in common? Long-time friends before successful couples.
Just ask him to hang out just the two of you. We’re sure things will work out. And if they don’t? You can always hope for a botched wedding in England to provide that accidental spark to kick start a relationship.
Have a question? A concern? A haiku of love for Dev + Steve? Submit it below!

Happy Wednesday, Harvard! And happy Rosh Hashanah to all those who celebrate it! For those of you who don’t know, Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year, and begins today at sundown. Check out Harvard Hillel for more information on services over the next couple of days.
Although some of you have class cancelled for this holiday, for the rest of us, it’s just another hump day. Here are some tips for getting through today. You can do it, we promise!
1) Listen to pump-up music on the way to class. This is doubly effective: it puts you in a great mood for the rest of the day, and serves as the universal excuse to avoid talking to people as you book it from Northwest Labs to Sever.
2) Treat yo self. Whether it’s a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks (#basic), Bon Me instead of today’s “whole wheat panini,” a greasy slice of Noch’s, or huge Felipe’s burrito, you deserve it.
3) Catch up on your favorite show’s season premiere. You’ve been avoiding Twitter because you don’t want to read any spoilers; you can’t talk to any of your friends from home without them insisting on talking about it—just take a break and watch the episode. You’ll be glad you did.
4) Facebook stalk a friend. And we mean stalk. Go like every embarrassing status they posted in 2008. Bonus points if you can come up with creative comments. Can you say best study break ever?
5) Don’t bring homework to brain break. Actually take a break and talk to that kid in your section who seems to be on your wavelength. The best thing about Harvard is the people, remember? Take some time to actually meet some of them!
With that, we wish you a happy Wednesday and a great rest of the week! If you make it through today, you’re almost there. Good luck!
IN THE ATMOSPHERE

Penn juniors Caroline Calle and Melissa Greenblatt recently launched the FRACKIT, "a jacket you wear to frats because you don’t mind if at the end of the night, it is covered in beer [and] frat sludge." Sounds great, kinda. But we have some questions about this revolutionary product.
Why is “jacket” misspelled?Last time we checked, there is no “i” in either “frat” or “jacket.” Is the FRACKIT part of your fratpocalypse kit? Was their first choice domain name already taken? Did they think no one would notice? Were Caroline and Melissa at a frat party when they named their company? Does Penn teach spelling?
What is “Frat Sludge?”Actually, do we really want to know?
Why does it have a hood?Are you pouring “frat sludge” on each other's heads? Won’t it be weird if everyone in the Penn frats is wearing a hood?
Won’t it get lost?The ideal outerwear for heading into a dark, hot, and crowded fraternity is a black, unmarked jacket that everyone else has? Really? REALLY?
