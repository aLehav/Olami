Early on in “Security,” Stephen Amidon’s most recent novel, security technician Edward Inman describes the changes in his job over the decades. “It used to be that a lock was enough to keep people calm; now paranoia dictates that every house be outfitted with cameras and sensors, wires under the floors, and reinforced panic rooms. No matter if Stoneleigh, Massachusetts is virtually crime-free—people want to know about every movement at every moment.”Inman’s brand of security is as much about control as it is about safety. This sort of conflation serves as a good metaphor for the action in Amidon’s novel. Each inhabitant of Amidon’s sleepy college town is in the process of losing agency over his or her own life, and is desperate to regain it: Kathryn, the town’s musician-turned-music teacher, feels that she is slowly losing touch with her son Conor but doesn’t know how to help him; Walt Steckl, the town’s loitering electrician, can’t help drinking and falls into unruly lewdness when he does; Angela, a student at the local college, clings pathetically to her ever-elusive professor and lover Stuart, while he, in turn, struggles with his writing. As their lives intersect—at times in unexpected ways—the book evokes the particularly tragic chaos of suburban existence in which adults, unwilling and untethered, slowly slide away from the vision of a happy life. It’s a reluctance to surrender these individual visions that fuels the collective fascination with one another’s failures. Suburban desperation is no new project for novelists and with his riskless and stilted prose, Amidon does little to build upon the motif. Tired and clunky language encumbers the novel, and thus, like the characters within, it never achieves its modest promise.The book opens with an alarm at Doyle Cutler’s house and, although nothing concrete has happened, it is clear that that Cutler is a man to look out for. Cutler has all the trappings of a villain—wealth, secrecy, and even a hairless cat. When the central event of the plot—Mary Steckl’s sexual assault—finally occurs midway through the book, it comes as no surprise that it should have happened at Cutler’s mansion.Meanwhile, characters are self-consciously shaking the foundations of their lives. When Inman runs into Conor outside Cutler’s home, it gives him the opportunity to start up an affair with former girlfriend Kathryn. Angela struggles to both sustain a relationship and keep a straight face in her creative nonfiction class, where she must hide her connection to Stuart. Walt Steckl wonders how to keep his recent trip to the courtroom from his dutiful and principled daughter. Each navigates his or her daily life with a hyperawareness of the eyes of others.After Mary’s assault, the plot picks up. The inhabitants of Stoneleigh, eager to snoop into their neighbors’ lives, jump on the case. They are desperate to establish the identity of the culprit. The flurry of action is more self-motivated than selfless—each, it seems has a secret connection to Cutler that must be sustained to preserve his or her outward image. Students and adults grab onto rumor in the hopes of establishing a palatable truth.In one of the better sequences of the novels, Mary’s classroom writing is published against her will in the local newspaper. Recent events mold Mary’s unexceptional words into a pointed argument about parental abuse. Nonfiction—the book, in this moment, suggests—holds no more fact than fiction, especially when in the hands of someone with something to prove. As appearance takes precedence over reality, Mary’s well-being goes unnoticed in the flood of accusations and revealed secrets.But by the time the story has opened up questions of about snooping and control, the characters have already exploited their potential for depth. Amidon’s people are flattened by the weight of his writing. “She might be twenty-one but she wasn’t born yesterday,” reads one attempt at interior monologue. Even when they finally spring into action, characters are stuck in the stiff mold Amidon has constructed with his prose. “Stuart was late for class. But he was never late for class”—Amidon often creates his tense mood with rigid contrasts. At times, the dialogue is as flavorless as cardboard, “It’s like I have been spinning my wheels,” says Inman to Kathryn. Are we really to believe that these people are as one-dimensional as Amidon makes them out to be?As his characters hang on to whatever fact they can, Amidon himself refuses to lose control. His reliance on formula comes across more as reluctance to hazard outside of the safe bounds of cliché than lack of talent. In “Security,” Amidon demonstrates that he has a flair for plot and an eye for intrigue. If only he would just relax and let go.—Staff writer Madeleine M.

Carl Phillips ’81 dramatizes the weeping of Patroclus’ horses at their owner’s death in the poem “Happiness”; “Immortal, / and yet earthbound, hovering around their disbelief, / around their instinct not to believe…” they weep without understanding, until the anguish recedes and they are returned to indifference. It is the analysis of sorrowful themes such as this, tinged with optimism, that characterizes his latest collection “Speak Low.”In his 10th book, a collection of 38 short poems, Phillips presents a thoughtful view on the rituals that propel us through life and the ways in which we are able to break free of them.A Harvard grad, Phillips first published his first collection, “In the Blood,” in 1992. He has since received many accolades for his work, including the Samuel Morris Prize and several fellowships. The basic human condition and its facets—mortality and sexuality among others—comprise the subject matter of much of his work.It is fitting that the title of the opening poem, and of the collection itself, is that of a Billy Holiday song; Phillips’ words have a soothing sound but deeper purpose. A sense of self-awareness and an unabashed exploration of human emotions is present throughout the collection. There is no subject which Phillips avoids as he seeks a release of his many thoughts rooted in retrospective themes. The challenge that ”Speak Low” presents is twofold. In creating poems as brief as he has, Phillips requires an immense amount of interaction from the reader. Patience and awareness is required from the reader, much like a serious conversation requires attention to conversation and an awareness of body language. The second challenge comes in the intense nature of the themes which he is exploring. Phillips is asking for consideration of subject matters both abstract and frightening, but he makes the journey worthwhile.Phillips has a tendency to refer to classical images and figures, which would be maddening if not for the notes section in the back. This handy reference provides a context for these numerous mentions of otherwise inscrutable symbols. For example, Topaz—a minor figure in ancient myth who was slain by Apollo—is the title and subject of a poem.The majority of Phillips’ images tend to draw parallels between human nature and the natural world. Comparisons between natural events and human actions pervade the collection, as in “The Damned,” when Phillips compares the sudden flight of birds from burning brush to “shame when, from the wrong end / of a foundering argument, it at last lets go.” Of a white egret walking in the white foam of the sea, in “Gold on Parchment,” Phillips observes that “invisibility seemed a thing worth / envying”. At other times, the beauty in Phillips images comes from his startling perversion of natural imagery. The most prominent example is in “Distortion,” where he relates the aging of peonies to “rough sex,” and the feeling of sexual possession to the possession of a “gutted deer” after a hunt. These images, startling though they may be, constitute variations on the themes that extend throughout the collection. The sense is that, while Phillips is addressing some of the less attractive aspects of life, ultimately the world through his eyes is beautiful.“Speak Low” follows Phillips’ trend of attention to punctuation. While certain poems, such as “The Moonflowers,” have a frustrating number of commas, throughout “Speak Low” Phillips widely employs the dash and the question mark, both of which make his thoughts easier to follow.Phillips, in his approach to challenging subjects, has created a well-crafted collection to add to his expansive body of work. In “Speak Low,” Phillips approaches human nature as a question. He does not propose to provide an answer but rather provides an exploration of the most probing of all unknowns, as we are asked to “Just this once, / pretend none of it matters: love; death; or ambition.”—Staff writer Kerry A.

“When she got to her feet, the knees of her pants were frayed and bits of gravel clung to the fabric, but she didn’t brush them clean or in any other way distract her focus from the figure kneeling on the opposite bank. The dark shape across the water grew elongated, also standing. They faced one another with the Feather River in between. In two or three more hours? they would kneel again and drink.”Among prose stylists, Denis Johnson has few living equals. His finest moments bristle with beauty and potential; words blossom inward toward the enigmatic center of the story, disclosing possibility rather than meaning. Sentences line the pages like bombs waiting to detonate. Johnson’s economy is the economy of Hemingway, if Hemingway was sleepwalking or under hypnosis. The passage above, from Johnson’s latest novel, “Nobody Move,” glimpses these heights. It’s the only one.In 2007, Johnson received the National Book Award for his six hundred-page Vietnam War epic, “Tree of Smoke.” Last year, he serialized “Nobody Move,” a self-proclaimed “noir novel,” in four parts—each corresponding to about 50 widely spaced pages—in “Playboy” magazine. At passing glance, the novel has all the trappings of a small joke told at the expense of a literary world that rushed to canonize Johnson in the wake of “Tree of Smoke.” A closer look, however, raises the question of whether the author had humor or self-sabotage on his mind.  “Nobody Move” is the gravitational inverse to a novel like “Tree of Smoke”: a breezy, barely-there venture into the heyday of pulp fiction. The concept actually has a good deal of promise behind it—“Jesus’ Son,” Johnson’s 1992 collection of short stories that is arguably his masterpiece, dwells on the short, ugly lives of a noir-esque cast of junkies and thugs in an abortive urban purgatory. But this book isn’t a novelization of “Jesus’ Son.” “Nobody Move” is—anticlimactically—a mild pulp pastiche that doesn’t even seem to rise to its own expectations.The plot is appropriately simple: Jimmy Luntz is a barbershop singer with a gambling addiction and an outstanding debt to a small-time loan shark. The supply of clichés at work throughout the novel’s first pages practically spell out the remainder of the story—a sultry, femme fatale of a love interest; a cross-country chase; a stoic, streetwise henchman looking to collect Luntz’s head; a shootout. That’s what readers get—and that’s all.As homage, “Nobody Move” never rises beyond pale imitation. It’s clear that Johnson knows the tropes by heart. The problem is that everyone else does too. The pleasure of homage, especially with a genre like noir, is in the author’s personal touches. Cormac McCarthy’s “No Country for Old Men” comes immediately to mind—move the action to Texas, ramp up the violence; nothing more complicated than that. But other than the aforementioned passage, and a frankness about various bodily functions, Johnson’s stylistic fingerprints are conspicuously absent from the novel.But “Nobody Move” doesn’t work as a parody either. Johnson never mocks or inflates the stock traits of noir or pulp any more than they would ordinarily mock and inflate themselves. If anything, the one implicit joke is on the author; there is only the awkwardness of a character self-consciously using a cell phone over a pay phone, or complaining about the steep minority of smokers in American society. Readers don’t laugh at Johnson’s noir-by-the-numbers. They laugh at the absurdity of a noir parody being published in 2009. And even laughing is a stretch.Could Johnson possibly be serious? Was the “Playboy” serialization meant to invoke the memory of past contributors such as Bradbury or Nabokov? Was Johnson pressured to publish a stand-alone edition? It’s not for us to infer, and it doesn’t seem likely, but for all its timidity, “Nobody Move” is best read as any other story. Sympathy falls typically, but genuinely, in favor of Luntz, especially when, in the face of almost certain castration, he tells a story about accepting a lottery ticket over a sizable amount of money as payment for childhood chores. Gambol, the debt-collector, for all his aloofness and savagery (he intends to eat the testicles in question), isn’t beyond love either; his relationship with the retired female Army medic is a charming—if lewd—extension of his story. As antiquated a genre as it might be, the sheer number of noir elements employed is enough to pull even the most fickle reader through the slim volume. The novel’s success isn’t one shining moment of stylistic joy—the aforementioned passage may even be out of place in “Nobody Move.” It’s that when the $2.3 million dollars that kicks around between the characters (you already knew there was some sum, even if you hadn’t been told) goes to the bad guys, the protagonists—and the reader—don’t really care. Subverting a genre obsessed with materialism isn’t exactly difficult, and Johnson doesn’t leave much to work with—but he’s no sadist.—Staff writer Ryan J.

Find yourself wanting to just whistle some Dixie? Jonesing for some jazz? Then, get your fix during Arts First weekend at the Harvard Dixieland Ensemble’s “New Orleans to New England: Dixieland and Early Jazz” performance tomorrow in Memorial Church. The 10-member ensemble will present an array of ragtime, traditional jazz, and Dixieland favorites, including “Down By the Riverside,” “Alabama Jubilee,” “Royal Garden Blues,” and “Eyes of Blue.”  This spring, senior bandleaders Max S. Mishkin ’09 and Greg D. Dyer ’09 realized the two-year-long dream of putting together a small band by recruiting their fellow students in The Harvard University Band to join what is now unofficially called The Charles Riverboat Band.  Mishkin credits the ensemble’s adviser Thomas G. Everett, who also directs The Harvard University Band, with “pushing us to listen across the group and improvise instead of just playing what’s on the page... [H]e has helped to make our music a lot more exciting to play and fun to hear.”Julie A. Duncan ’09, a pianist-turned-trombonist, had never had any experience with playing Dixieland, jazz, or any type of improvisational music before joining The Charles Riverboat Band. “I always refused to join jazz ensembles, because I was terrified of improv…but the [band] has allowed me to take baby steps toward improvising,” she says, “and now I will be playing a solo or two in Saturday’s performance.”Similarly, most of the band members had no experience with Dixieland music before joining the band this semester. Reacting to this, Mishkin notes that their joint endeavor is a “good example of how much you can learn—and how much you can enjoy it—when you push yourself outside your comfort zone and try something new.”

Numerous Lebanese are facing a difficult choice in the upcoming parliamentary elections, scheduled to take place on June 7. According to the New York Times, donors from across the globe are pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into Lebanon in order to impact the elections. The Saudi Arabian government is involved, with an aim to buy votes in support of the election of Saad Hariri and his allies. For the average voter that could mean $800 or so in exchange for a vote—not to mention the dignity, free speech, and political rights that could also be taken. Other questionable practices include financing the trips of Lebanese immigrants to their homeland to vote for the current majority coalition. It pains us to see that Saudi Arabia is interfering in the election process of an emerging democratic country.
This represents an assault to Lebanon’s sovereignty that we condemn. Elections have to be free in order for representative government to function. An official from the Saudi Arabian government justified the use of such dubious techniques as a way to oppose Iranian influence—as Iran has funded Hezbollah, a militant Shi’a group in the south of Lebanon. 
Iran, however, is not currently in the process of directly hijacking an election. The Saudi bribes are also a breach of Lebanese electoral laws, which forbid the outright purchasing of votes and place a cap on the spending of candidates in the two months prior to an election.
Apart from the moral and ethical problems that buying off voters raises, such an act can increase instability in this frail country. It could lead the opposing party to doubt the legitimacy of the elections and lead to calls for another round of elections. 
The country has already been through its share of political turmoil—culminating last year in gunfights in the streets of Beirut. Political leaders then headed to Doha and negotiated a power-sharing agreement in order to calm sectarian tensions. 
Corrupted elections could very well lead the country to the brink of civil war.
Ironically, though, these backhanded techniques are also a testament to how far democracy has come in Lebanon. In order to influence the election result, Saudi Arabia has had to directly address the citizens of Lebanon. In earlier decades, just a few big backroom deals behind closed doors might have done the job. 
Today electoral power now more clearly rests with the people of Lebanon. Nevertheless, we urge foreign powers to respect the autonomy of Lebanon and the true electoral desires of Lebanese voters.
Overall we hope to see a free and democratic election in Lebanon that truly represents the choice of its voters. We encourage the Lebanese to refuse the purchase deals and chose their candidate independently—or perhaps, as one Lebanese artist turned candidate put it, “Take the money and vote against them.”

I’ll admit it. I’m not a Twitter user, because Twitter scares me.
Well, technically I am a Twitter user—I signed up about two weeks ago. Some kind soul named “harvarddhall” posts HUDS menu listings for lunch and dinner in concise posts, and I use Twitter’s mobile messaging tool to get those listings sent to my phone via text message. It’s great since I’m usually too lazy to type “huds” into my browser URL.
But that’s where my Twitter usage ends—there’s something about its combination of voyeurism and narcissism that just gets to me.
On the face of it, Twitter seems like a pretty neat idea. Twitter-ers post 140-character long “tweets” on anything they choose, a la Facebook’s status-update feature. They “follow” each other, so that a user’s followers can automatically see their posts on their main page. A commenting feature allows Twitter-ers to interact with tweets.
About half of the tweets I’ve seen are normal status updates: users can post “just got to the office” or “thesising in Widener,” for example. So far, this sounds a lot like Facebook, with its status updates and news feed, and I recall that Facebook encouraged these location-  and action-type posts when status updates were first launched.
Yet, while on Facebook these status updates exist alongside photos, wall posts, and birthday reminders, Twitter doesn’t have much else to distract users. The entire concept of the website is based on these little snippets of information.  It’s a creepy form of forced voyeurism, a means by which a Twitter-er makes sure his or her followers are aware of his or her actions at any given time.
It’s also a platform for narcissism. Users often go beyond the standard post about location to get creative with their 140 characters. I find the other half of tweets to be mainly composed of rants (customer service, Twitter site downtime, self-injury) and random introspection. 
Rants I can understand—breaking a bone sucks, and it’s understandable to want to talk about it. Attempts at introspection, on the other hand, are where the problem kicks in. Public Twitter user jquaglia, for example, writes, “Do you ever have one of those days when you feel like every wishbone you pull breaks the wrong way?” Deep, man, just deep. Such self-indulgence has always existed on angsty teenage blogs like Livejournal, but now it is condensed and made absurd by its brevity. Speaking to no one in particular, about nothing in particular, in a space so short that nothing possibly meaningful can be said reeks of vanity. It boils down to the desire to appear thoughtful to the world and the need to hear one’s own voice into its most naked and ridiculous form.
In moderation, Twitter probably isn’t so bad. It’s the over-users who tweet every action and the attention-seekers posting introspection who stop me from using it (other than for HUDS menu listings). I just don’t want to turn into user Rogelio Umaña, who tweeted this gem last year: “I just found out somebody is stalking me on the Internet! :0 Should I worry? Nah! I embrace it!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, rumors that hot breakfast would no longer be available in the House dining halls created quite an uproar on campus. Though the fate of Veritas waffles may be at stake, I trust that the student body can speak for itself about such matters. I am more concerned with another potential budget cut that would involve layoffs of low-wage workers, particularly because their voices are not always heard. 
Laying off Harvard’s workers is unjust because they should not have to bear the heaviest burden of a crisis that they did not create. Layoffs devastate people’s lives and families, contributing to the economic crisis because people without jobs can no longer afford to pay for basic needs. The onus that we face is finding a way to make these unjust cuts unnecessary ones by seeking out other means of meeting Harvard’s new budgetary demands.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences faces a massive $220 million deficit for next year. In order to address this gap, Dean Michael Smith has announced a restructuring of FAS. With every change, there will inevitably be a constituency that objects, but Harvard should emphasize an ethos of shared sacrifice as we weather this process. The deans, along with the Harvard Corporation, should conduct a transparent process to address the deficit in such a way that harnesses the wealth of intelligence and creativity on campus and assures us that all voices are heard. 
The most symbolic measure of shared sacrifice would be reducing the salaries of highly paid administrators and senior faculty. Though these measures would not be enough to balance the budget on their own, graduated pay cuts could save many jobs. Other universities have committed to this, and Harvard needs to do so as well.
There are many other changes that Harvard could make to reduce personnel costs without laying off workers. For instance, FAS pays its employees during the vacation between Christmas and New Year’s. Cutting that paid vacation could save millions of dollars.
Students must also make sacrifices. Perhaps every House does not need a $500 grant from the College Events Board for a Yardfest pregame. While it would be disappointing if the Office of Residential Life no longer funded decorations for House Committee events, it would be more devastating to see clerical workers lose their jobs. These trade-offs abound at an institution like Harvard. Luckily, we can still have fun without spending upwards of $10,000 on a House formal.  
Of course, there are those who argue that Harvard’s mission lies in its academic pursuits and that we must therefore accept layoffs as inevitable and eat our Veritas waffles in peace. These people forget that the budget cuts are already hurting the educational mission of the school. 
More importantly, these people fail to recognize that teaching morality in a classroom means nothing if you cannot act with the same integrity that you hope to teach. Yes, Harvard must do what it does best—teach, research and foster learning—but we cannot shy away from the responsibility to be an upstanding institution. If Harvard lays off its workers, it will only contribute to the economic crisis of our time. Now, more than ever, is an opportunity for Harvard to stand as an example of moral integrity. 
Luckily, Harvard is better equipped to weather this crisis than almost any other institution. I am confident that through the creativity and intelligence of our community, a great deal of money could be saved without cutting jobs. Harvard’s endowment is massive—no matter how much money we’ve lost in the current crisis. And we continue to enjoy the financial perks of being a nonprofit, which means that we do not pay taxes on the endowment money that we have amassed over the years.
To put it more bluntly, Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world, and it should not be afraid of using this capital to sustain itself during the current recession. Perhaps the deans and the Corporation should release more endowment money to schools like FAS in order to ensure that budget cuts can be made without layoffs. Right now, the FAS budget deficit of $220 million comes directly from an eight percent decrease in endowment money being funneled into FAS. Although it would be unsustainable over the long term, Harvard could dip further into its endowment over the next year or two in hopes that the economy will begin to grow again. 
Unfortunately, important decisions like these are made by the Harvard Corporation in an opaque and secretive manner. This process should instead be exposed to intellectual debate within the Harvard community. We must outline criteria in order to move forward so that people whose lives and families are at risk are not left out of this process. 
Although every budgeting decision is a difficult one, Harvard is better poised than the rest of America to show the depth of its ethical decision-making. To that end, Harvard can and should avoid layoffs.

As one of Asia’s oldest conflicts in one of Asia’s oldest democracies seemingly comes to a dark, bloody conclusion, a number of questions about the war in Sri Lanka and the ideological banners under which it marched come to the forefront: What is the value of a democracy if the price is self-determination? What is the value of territorial control if the price is social cohesion? What is the value of a national political unity if the price is a national political identity? What is the value of power if the price is human life? 
These questions are complex and echo in many places around the globe where non-state actors control territory: with the Zapatistas in Mexico, the FARC in Colombia, and the Maoists in Nepal. Although the groups may be condemned terrorists, there comes a point when one wonders whether adopting absolutist “us vs. them” rhetoric is worth it. 
I certainly do not pretend to know the answers to the moral quandaries. But I do know that, now that the Sri Lankan state has defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, more commonly referred to as the Tamil Tigers, the government’s value rigidity—all of its black-and-white moralizing of the conflict—must cease if there is to be any chance at a permanent peace and a brighter future. More specifically, as the state finishes off the rebels, it must promise to address the political grievances of the minority groups whom the rebels claim to defend. Tamils, in particular, must be granted equal political rights and be given the ability to direct affairs where they constitute a majority.
Now, as military conflict—but certainly not everyday social conflict or even paramilitary conflict—descends into stasis, it is worth meditating upon what the war has been worth. Amidst all the rhetoric of doubts and redoubts, one practical concern should worry President Rajapaksa in particular: What are the chances of a legitimized nation-state if an entire ethnic group feels that it has, for the last 25 years, been a target for elimination or, as the more impassioned critics claim, genocide? 
There is no doubt that the Tigers are a dangerous terrorist group. Even now, on the eve of the last battle, they defend their position with human shields: Tamil women and children. But the Tigers are not the Tamil population, and it does not follow that the legitimate claims of those who see them as freedom fighters should be unduly ignored. It’s been total war thus far, and both the state and the tigers have committed severe human-rights violations (the state itself has refused to allow the United Nations Human Rights Council to conduct an investigation). It is in Sri Lanka’s best interest not to pretend that ethnic violence on both sides did not occur. A sustainable peace cannot include any demonization of the Tamils, whether it is direct or indirect through the continued framing of the Tigers—who are heroes to many Tamil youth—as the source of all evil on the island.
Since the 1980s, at least, the center of Sri Lankan politics has been dominated by Sinhalese Buddhists. Tamil Hindus and Muslims have often gotten the short end of the stick with regard to education, discriminatory language policies, and pogroms and political gerrymandering in their traditional homeland.  
The Tamils are clearly not going to be given autonomy over their homeland. But they must be given equal political rights and at least the majority of the say in what goes on where they live. Dr. Amartya Sen has stated that the Sri Lankan government long ago forsook the “richness of plurality” and pushed Tamils to the peripheries of power. They must rediscover that richness and bring them back into the fold. Tamils must be granted the immediate ability to not only non-violently control affairs where they live, but also to have a voice in the national government, so that they may one day consider themselves just as Sri Lankan as the Sinhalese. 
Sri Lankans, whether Tamil Hindus, Sinhalese Buddhist, or Muslims, should not have to choose between multiculturalism and political rights on the one hand and national security and the safety of their children on the other. Before the official end of the war, a promise must be made to address many of the Tamil grievances—short of independence—that fueled the fire in the first place. There cannot simply be a victor’s peace, for that is no peace.
Once upon a time, the island of Sri Lanka was predicted to become the fifth Asian Tiger. That dream of prosperity can still be realized. But the state must adopt a more mature perspective on the possibilities of peace and prosperity. Nothing good will come through an asymmetric imposition of power based on ethnic lines. As Martin Luther King once said, “In the final analysis, the end is pre-existent in the means.” If sustainable peace is to be an end for Sri Lanka, the government must embody a new set of values as it mops up the conflict and begins to lay the foundations for a new society.

Stemming from budget shortfalls and University-wide measures to rein in spending, the Quad Library will discontinue service at the end of this semester, according to Harvard College Library spokeswoman Beth S. Brainard. 
Though the Quad Library’s book collection will be redistributed, its reading room will remain open.
“We’re exiled as it is,” said Jon T. Staff ’10, a resident of Currier House. “Taking our books away doesn’t seem right, especially at a great university where we’re supposed to be spending most of our time with books.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Director of Communications Robert P. Mitchell cited low student usage and the need for more social spaces for student groups as the reasons for the Quad Library’s closing in a pre-released statement to The Crimson.
In the statement, Mitchell emphasized that the closing serves to “re-purpose” the Quad Library’s space.
“The space freed up by this move —nearly 10,000 square feet—provides Harvard College with the opportunity to provide study and large event social space for undergraduates,” Mitchell wrote.
Despite high-profile College initiatives in recent years to construct these campus-wide social spaces—including the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub and the Student Organization Center at Hilles—there remains a dearth of such venues that aim to accommodate large-scale extracurricular and social events.
The issue of social spaces aside, Brainard noted that “closing the Quad library was part of our budget-reduction scenario.”
Other campus libraries have already felt the effects of fiscal belt-tightening. In some House libraries, tutors have had to cut back on hours and hire fewer students. 
According to Brainard, HCL will have to reduce its operating budget by 15 percent and plan for an additional 16 percent reduction over the course of the next two years.  
Though the recent merger of four science libraries, announced last month, was not motivated by costs, both that consolidation and the Quad Library’s closing mark the College administration’s attempts to maximize library efficiency. 
Closing the Quad Library will allow the College “to shift resources to support library programs that are more heavily used by students,” according to Mitchell’s statement.

The Cambridge Public School Committee ratified the employment contract for the district’s new superintendent yesterday evening, finalizing the appointment of Jeffrey M. Young, the current head of Newton Public Schools.The  three-year contract—which was signed last Wednesday by Young and Mayor E. Denise Simmons on behalf of the school committee—was reviewed by the committee in a private session but passed unanimously during the public portion of the meeting.While Young was voted in as the district’s new superintendent on April 7, his formal selection was contingent upon the establishment of a contract that would satisfy both Young and the school committee.Young is scheduled to begin his term on July 6, 2009, but will begin a five-day transition period before that date, during which he will be taking vacation time from his post at Newton.According to the contract, Young will be paid an annual beginning salary $215,000, an amount which will increase after each subsequent year of service. After one year, his salary will be raised to $221,000, and after two years, it will be raised to $227,000.   These amounts are lower than his present salary in Newton, according to school committee member Luc D. Schuster, who also served as the co-chair of the superintendent search committee. Young is currently paid approximately $248,000 as superintendent of Newton Public Schools.Although Young’s term is set to end in 2012, the agreement allows for the school committee to vote to renew his contract in July 2011.Although Simmons was one of two school committee members who voted against Young, she said that the ratification of the contract “wasn’t a contentious process at all.”“We have one goal in mind: to do best for all children. When that is your driving theme, you lay down your differences,” she said, adding that this does not necessarily mean the committee members have differences on this issue.The committee responsible for the facilitating the superintendent’s transition into the district will meet today and Friday at the mayor’s office.—Staff writer Sofia E.

Harvard Law School will lay off staff members in response to budgetary constraints imposed by University administrators, acting Dean Howell E. Jackson said Monday.The likely layoffs come amidst continued estimates of a 30 percent decline in endowment value by year’s end and a corresponding reduction in the endowment payout—a major source of funding for the University’s different schools that accounts for 40 percent of the Law School’s annual revenue.A recent University request for a 10 percent reduction in the Law School budget has made staff layoffs inevitable as the school works to maintain its commitments to financial aid and its educational priorities, Jackson said in an interview with The Crimson Monday.“These are material changes that will affect our budgets in future years,” Jackson said. “We will need to reduce our staff levels in order to live within our new means.”But at this stage, the magnitude of future layoffs remains unclear, and will depend on the participation rate that the school sees in an early retirement incentive program for staff that will conclude next week, according to Marie H. Bowen, an assistant dean and chief human resources officer at the Law School. To supplement the results of the early retirement program and diminish the need for layoffs, the Law School will try to keep currently unfilled staff positions empty in order to trim operating expenses, Jackson said.But how effective this hiring “chill” will be at closing the gap in the school’s budget remains to be seen.“If we can use the chilled positions that would obviously be easier, but my expectation will be that we will have some layoffs in [the upcoming fiscal year],” he said. Jackson emphasized Monday that any decision to lay off workers would be carefully weighed “to make sure it’s the right choice.”But according to labor activist and first-year law student Marissa A. Vahlsing, the school has already initiated de facto staff cuts, asking subcontractors to cut their expenses, which has resulted in job losses and the summer closure of a cafe in the basement of Harkness Commons, the Law School student center.Student labor activists present at a brief private meeting with Jackson last week said that the acting Dean was unaware of the impending cafe closure and criticized the lack of transparency in the decision making process regarding layoffs.Student activists have recently disputed the notion that the University’s core mission revolves around its educational mission—a central argument behind the administration’s justification for staff layoffs.Laura M. Binger, a third year law student who said Jackson made that claim during the recent meeting with labor activists, expressed her concern over what she views as a distortion of Harvard’s mission.Recent weeks have seen a proliferation of labor protests at the College over staff layoffs, but student activists at the Law School expressed concern over their peers’ apparent lack of engagement with the issue, which they say poses a potential hurdle to mounting layoff protests similar to those at the College.—Staff writer Elias J.

With three confirmed cases of swine flu linked to the Harvard Dental School in the past week, the Ivory Tower has relinquished hopes of immunity and turned to greater vigilance.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith advised professors gathered at yesterday’s Faculty meeting to be on the lookout for possible communications from the administration regarding updates on the spread of H1N1 “swine flu.”
University President Drew G. Faust—who cited illness on Sunday when she missed the town hall meeting for the Undergraduate Council—took the message to heart and refused to make contact with professors receiving honorary A.M. degrees from the University at yesterday’s meeting.
“Under the instructions of the dean of our School of Public Health, I’m not going to shake anybody’s hand,” Faust said, before dispensing the degrees to recently tenured faculty members.
“No hug?” asked government professor Steven R. Levitsky, who walked towards Faust with arms outstretched to receive his degree.
Faust kept her distance and proffered Levitsky’s large white envelope from a safe distance.
“People are going to have to stop kissing the President,” she mused.
GEN ED OF YONDER YEARS
After Smith read the memorial minute in commemoration of former FAS Dean Jeremy R. Knowles, Faust said it would be fitting to also say a few words about General Education, which Knowles had worked on during his last few months as dean.
When the Faculty voted for the new curriculum in the spring of 2007, it marked a dual-sided commitment, Faust said.
“I just wanted to mark this transition today as one of both continuity and change,” she said. “The Faculty made a choice embedded with Harvard’s storied past, but you also called for a curriculum that will be new and forward-looking.”
“I look forward very much to watching this unfold,” Faust added.

CLASS WITH PROFESSOR SELTZER
At yesterday’s meeting, Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer solicited questions and comments from the Faculty regarding the most recent version of the self-study report required for the University’s review for reaccreditation in October.
Except for one professor’s concern that the educational value of museums was underrepresented in the report, the Faculty was silent.
“See, if this were a class, I would poll you to see how many of you actually read the report,” Seltzer said. “I don’t want to go there.”
After another bout of silence, Faust interjected: “I think you should take this as a tribute to all the work that you did.”
The University, which began initial drafting of the approximately 100-page reaccreditation report last summer, released last month its most recent version of the document, which addresses how the institution is working to meet the 11 standards of accreditation, ranging from academics to University finances.

In response to professors’ concerns that restructuring the Faculty of Arts and Sciences could result in downsizing, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith emphasized the administration’s commitment to determining the Faculty’s priorities before undertaking large-scale cuts at yesterday’s Faculty meeting.
Reiterating his goal of broad-based “reshaping” of FAS to make up a $220 million deficit over the next two years—but characteristically shying away from discussing specific initiatives—Smith said the six working groups must reevaluate Faculty “excellence” in light of the budgetary crunch.
“I don’t just want to follow directionless reductions, one after another,” said Smith, who stressed the importance of implementing carefully informed structural changes that do not compromise quality.
“If we don’t have that articulated goal when we hit our deadline, who knows where we’re going to end up?” Smith said. “That’s a guaranteed path to non-excellence.”
On Monday, the administration will debut a web resource for Faculty with consistently updated information about some—not all, Smith emphasized—of the initiatives that will achieve the $77 million of cuts planned for the fiscal year ending next July, Smith said.
The annual Dean’s report with the financial data of FAS for the fiscal year ending July 2008 was supposed to come out this spring, but Smith said he will delay its release until the beginning of the next academic year. The upcoming report will outline FAS finance information for the most current fiscal year as well.
During the question-and-answer period of the Faculty meeting, classics professor Richard F. Thomas questioned Smith’s optimistic casting of the situation and expressed concern that restructuring could result in harmful cutting.
“I’m also just uncomfortable as a thinking human being in accepting terminology that doesn’t seem to suit the situation,” Thomas said of Smith’s charge to “reshape” FAS. “I think we have different definitions of excellence.”
Chinese literature professor Wilt Idema said during the meeting that he was worried that as the working groups further define the “core” priorities of each academic division, the fields that “straddle the border” may get shortchanged.
FACULTY PASSES NEW 
SCIENCE DEPARTMENT
At yesterday’s meeting, the Faculty approved the proposal to establish the new Department of Human Evolutionary Biology to replace the present biological anthropology wing of the anthropology department.
The new department, which will be effective July 1, will administer the concentration in human evolutionary biology and the biological anthropology track of the concentration in anthropology.
Anthropology professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 said the field of biological anthropology has diverged drastically in methodology and focus from the curriculum’s current archaeology and social anthropology tracks, which lie in the social sciences.
Moreover, the formation of the new department will condense four administrative bodies into two—effectively reducing costs in a fiscal climate where the formation of a new department could be seen as extravagant, Lieberman said.
Currently, the anthropology department offers concentrations in human evolutionary biology and anthropology. Within the latter, concentrators can specialize in one of the three wings: archaeology, biological anthropology, and social anthropology.
With the establishment of the human evolutionary biology department, the concentration in anthropology will continue to be administered by the anthropology department and offer tracks in archaeology and in social anthropology.

Researchers at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics have found mathematical evidence that suggests that wandering black holes may be present at the periphery of our galaxy.The study will give scientists clues to the early history of the galaxy and will also increase the understanding of galactic evolution.“It helps with figuring out how our galaxy was assembled,” said Abraham Loeb, a professor of astronomy. “It will tell us whether early galaxies had black holes at their center.”According to Loeb and graduate student Ryan M. O’Leary, the Milky Way Galaxy may have hundreds of black holes present in its outer regions, which were created when early galaxies combined to create the Milky Way. The merge formed a massive black hole in the center and hundreds of smaller wandering black holes on the periphery of the galaxy.“We now know that every galaxy has a black hole at its center and that galaxies merge,” Loeb said. “The Milky Way galaxy was made out of building blocks of dwarf galaxies, which came together.”General relativity calculations give evidence for the existence of the black holes—if visual evidence is found within astronomical observations, the black holes would “test the predictions of general relativity,” O’Leary said.The cluster is expected to be highly compact and the “black hole will give the stars higher speeds.”O’Leary has started the search for these compact clusters using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Database—a program that maps the Northern Hemisphere’s sky.The objects should have already been detected in the database, but since no one has been looking for them, they haven’t been identified and studied, he said.O’Leary is currently sifting through the data and hopes that he will identify potential star clusters harboring a rogue black hole.Though these black holes may be roaming our galaxy, the security of the Earth is not in question, according to Loeb. The chances that a black hole is located close to our solar system are “very small,” he added.But if one were to pass too close to our solar system, it would likely “disturb the movement of the inner planets,” including Earth, according to Loeb.But for now, no one should lose sleep over these rogue black holes lurking among the peripheral stars of our galaxy.

The Undergraduate Council voted in favor of starting a 16-month capital campaign to fund a student community center on Sunday evening. 
The property at 45 Mt. Auburn St., which currently houses the Democracy Center, is being considered for the UC’s social space. The building is valued at four million dollars, according to the Foundation for Civic Leadership (FCL), the organization that owns the Democracy Center.
The FCL has already received bids for the property, according to FCL President Ian T. Simmons ’98-’00. Simmons spoke at the Council meeting on Sunday and said that the foundation wanted to sell the property to the UC because the organizations shared common goals.
“All the [current] bidders would have turned it into an exclusive space,” he said. “The best option is for us to sell the building to a group that would turn it into something exciting.”
While negotiations are ongoing, further legislation may be put forward by the UC to ask the FCL to postpone entering agreements with other institutions to give the UC time to make a decision.
“We’re basically doing something very stupid which is to consider delaying a very, very good offer... to give you a little time,” Simmons said.
The UC capital campaign has already received a $4,000 donation from an anonymous source.
Although the legislation passed on Sunday did mention the possibility of buying the 45 Mt. Auburn St. property, it did not bind the Council to the purchase.
The current language of the bill, which narrowly passed, says that “the capital raised first be applied to the creation of a Student Community Center at 45 Mt. Auburn St. through purchase, leasing, or leasing-to-own, if the terms of the deal with the current owners of 45 Mt. Auburn St. are amenable to the Undergraduate Council.”
While a deal has yet to be made, the FCL has expressed the desire to retain the top two floors of the building for their own use, according to Joshua J. Nuni ’10, a UC representative who consulted an architect.
Renovations to make the 45 Mt. Auburn St. basement usable are estimated to cost between three hundred and four hundred thousand dollars, according to a presentation given to the Council by Nuni. 
“[The basement] would be very unsafe to have people using it right now,” Nuni said. “It’s usable for storage.”
The first floor also requires renovations. Currently, it is not handicap accessible and needs a new sprinkler system.
The UC legislation also resolved that the Council hire four members of the student body as full-time staffers for the campaign to raise funds. So far, at least 58 students have indicated that they would be interested in volunteering for the campaign and eight have expressed interest in applying for full-time jobs, according to Nuni.
Many opponents of the legislation at the UC General Meeting were skeptical that the Council would be able to raise the necessary funds in time, particularly considering the current economic climate.
Any social space purchase made by the UC would likely have to be funded mostly by the capital campaign. It is unlikely that the Council will finish the year with more than a few thousand dollars outside their reserve fund.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said she would not support raising the student fee on the termbill that students pay to the Council to contribute to fundraising for a social space purchase. Currently the fee is $75.
“I think we would not allow them to raise that for the simple reason of buying something like the Democracy Center,” Hammonds said.

About 200 students affiliated with Phillips Brooks House Association gathered in Lowell Dining Hall on Monday evening for the eighth annual Public Service Celebration, a formal dinner held to recognize outstanding senior volunteers for their achievements. While many students were honored for their social service work throughout the night, the specter of PBHA’s financial difficulties cast a slight damper on the evening’s festivities. Compared with previous years, fewer awards were distributed on Monday evening. “Due to some underperformance in the Harvard endowment, there was not as much funding to provide these awards,” said PBHA Executive Director Gene A. Corbin. While three students in years past had received the Stride Rite Post-Graduate Fellowship—a prize that comes with $25,000—only one student received the award.Katherine A. Carroll ’09, who was awarded the fellowship, will continue her work as a coordinator at a youth center in Dorchester after graduation.In addition, Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09 and Valonda J. Harris ’09 received the Stride Rite Senior Recognition Prize, a cash award given to students who have demonstrated consistent contributions to public service in their undergraduate careers. Last year, seven of these awards were distributed.Corbin began the event by recognizing about two dozen outstanding seniors, but asked the audience to only acknowledge these students’ achievements in spirit because fewer monetary awards would be distributed than in previous years.The event also featured speeches from three graduating seniors: Grant M. Damon ’09, Nene V. Igietseme ’09, and Shane P. Donovan ’09. While Damon’s talk focused on thanking PBHA for its effect on his life, Igietseme and Donovan both made statements that were more politically tinged. Igietseme discussed the notion of radicalism, encouraging the audience to embrace a sense of radical compassion for their communities. “I have been proud in my years at PBHA to be in the presence of radicals who have dedicated their lives to a vision of what this world can be,” Igietseme said. PBHA President Richard S. Kelley ’10 said that while he was disappointed by the fiscal realities that limited the number of awards, he was pleased with the turnout and the atmosphere of the event. “We were able to honor a lot of really great seniors through the awards and in other ways,” he said. —Staff writer Evan T.R.

Three of the nine cases of influenza reported at the Harvard Dental School earlier this week were confirmed as H1N1 “swine flu” yesterday after the Massachusetts Department of Public Health received notice from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, where the testing was conducted. Since the announcement of the original cluster of nine cases on Friday, no new suspected cases have been identified among Harvard faculty, staff, and students, allaying fears of an impending epidemic. As a result, the Harvard Medical School resumed full clinical and classroom functioning as of yesterday, according to David S. Rosenthal ’59, director of Harvard University Health Services. Rosenthal said that the notification from the DPH would mean that classes at the Dental School—along with all faculty and student clinical activity at the Harvard Dental Center—will remain suspended until tomorrow, following a plan laid out last Friday. “If things stay stable, hopefully they’ll [both] be open on Thursday,” Rosenthal said, also noting that all of the infected students were making full recoveries. The three Harvard cases join a total of 34 cases in Massachusetts, a figure that officials say has ballooned over the week due to the newly-acquired availability of highly specific testing within the Boston area’s state lab. None of the cases in Massachusetts have led to fatalities, though three patients were forced to seek hospital treatment. Rosenthal addressed concerns— raised at last Friday’s press conference held by members of the Boston Public Health Commission—that patients treated by the infected students as part of their clinical rotations could be at risk of infection themselves. Rosenthal said that all of those patients had been informed of the exposure and were advised to seek prompt treatment if they developed symptoms, though he called the risk of transmission “relatively low” due to the masks and gloves worn by students during the course of rotations.—Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

Teams who have found themselves in the middle of the pack throughout a regular season often await that one opportunity to prove their abilities. They are anxious for that one chance to show they belong among the best in their respective sport.The Harvard co-ed sailing team was given that chance this past weekend at the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Semifinals at the Fan Pier Boston. Facing light and shifty winds that created rather tricky conditions, the Crimson placed seventh in the western portion of the semifinals. Harvard was rewarded for its efforts with one of 18 spots in the ICSA/Gill National Dinghy Championships in San Francisco, Calif. from June 1-3, accomplishing its season-long goal of making nationals.“The first and foremost goal was to qualify,” senior skipper Jon Garrity said. “The wind was not super cooperative out there this weekend, so we are happy to move on.”While the women’s squad was not in competition over the weekend, Harvard also had a contingent of sailors from the co-ed team compete at the BU Trophy in Boston, placing 11th overall as a team.ICSA NATIONAL SEMIFINALSThe Crimson co-ed squad had been eyeing the ICSA National Semifinals all season long, as a chance to qualify for nationals and also to perform well at an event that brought together many of the top collegiate teams in the country.“It was a very competitive weekend of racing,” Garrity said. “Things were made a bit trickier by the fact that we were only able to get in eight races in each division, which is a rather small sample size. This meant that not all of the top teams might qualify, so we needed to perform well.”The regatta, which was co-hosted by Harvard and MIT, consisted of a western and eastern portion, in which the top nine schools from each contest’s 18-team field moved on to nationals. Yale won the western portion of the affair, which the Crimson competed in, while Georgetown took home the team trophy in the eastern category of the race. However, Harvard’s seventh-place team effort was more than enough to enable it to make the trip to nationals, as it totaled 111 points, 46 better than the top-placing non-qualifying school in its division, Connecticut College.The Crimson’s efforts were led over the weekend by the B-division duo of Garrity and sophomore crew Grace Charles. They placed third in their division, starting and ending the weekend with victories and collecting another one along the way to bring their total to three wins over the two days of competition.“It was really a team effort out there this weekend,” Garrity said. “We stepped up for each other when we needed to.”In the A division, sophomore captain and skipper Alan Palmer teamed up with fellow second-year Quincy Bock, who took care of crewing duties. The pair finished ninth in the division, as they finished in the top five in half of their eight races, placing in the top three on two occasions.Harvard can now look forward to making the cross-country trek to the West Coast for nationals at the beginning of the summer.“There is a wide open field at nationals,” Garrity said. “Three teams have consistently been at the top of the standings all year, but for the rest of us, anything can happen.”The northern California waters will also present the Crimson with a different environment than it is used to sailing in.“San Francisco is an extremely windy venue, and we must take into account wind and currents while we are out there,” Garrity said. “We need to get better in big breeze, which means we will continue to lift weights each week in preparation.”BU TROPHYThe BU Trophy on the Charles River over the weekend afforded a contingent from the co-ed team some competition against talented teams as the season approaches its closing weeks. The Crimson placed 11th in a 15-team field, with Salve Regina taking home top honors.In the A division, the Harvard team of sophomore skipper Matt Donelan and freshman crew William White in races one through six, along with the efforts of second-years skipper Colin Santangelo and crew Florence On in races seven through nine, took home a 12th place finish.“The wind was really shifty this weekend in both direction and pressure,” Santangelo said. “There were a few races out there that really threw me for a loop.”Their B division counterparts matched the A division’s 12th place efforts, as junior skipper Alex Bick and junior crew Ali Beyer competed for the Crimson.

You know the story. With the flurry of acceptance letters comes inspirational, vomit-inducing stories in local papers. You know, the ones extolling the admitted students' virtues (brainy, friendly, well-liked, and modest!), detailing the horrible, horrible dilemma of being accepted to multiple schools with various scholarship options (Harvard?! or Princeton?? or Stanford??? or a FULL RIDE TO [insert state school]?!?! OMG MY LIFE IS SO DIFFICULT!! FML!!), and of course, FlyBy's favorite—recounting highly storied anecdotes from their time as a precocious child budding with Ivy League potential ("Alfonso was always the first to finish coloring in his kindergarten class—we always knew he would do great things.")
Toolish quotes after the jump.
Yeah, these stories sell. Especially when local reporters manage to make you look more insufferable than you actually are. Parents intent on breeding Harvard graduates cut these out and pin them above their offspring's beds for nightly inspiration.
But all gentle mockery aside, FlyBy sincerely welcomes the incoming class of budding Einsteins and future POTUSes. Congratulations, Class of 2013.
