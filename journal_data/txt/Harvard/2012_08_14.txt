After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
OKLAHOMA CITY, Oklahoma—Below me are emerald and amber patches. They cross across the flat expanse like a perfectly earth-toned quilt. Finally the sky sinks away and the patchwork earth moves closer and closer as I descend into the “heartland” of America.
Leaving behind Buenos Aires to return to Oklahoma City is like moving between two different planets. From population, to nightlife, to cars on the street, the two cities could not be more different.
However, the most striking difference is the contrast between the respective skylines. While Buenos Aires seems like an expanse of buildings that never end, Oklahoma City’s lack of buildings is evident. Upon descending, the flat blanket of earth and farmland catches my eye, as does the lack of true city life.
While Oklahoma has a strong oil and gas industry, the capital has not been transformed into a booming city, but rather still resembles the beginnings of what I hope is yet to come.
But amidst the small spattering of low buildings and small enterprises, there is one structure that rises above the rest: the Devon Tower. Until the Devon Tower was constructed this year, the lack of skyscrapers was dismissible. However, after the skyscraper took its place in the city, it is impossible not to notice.
“Have you seen the new Devon building?” the man beside me on the airplane questions. I notice the pride in his voice as he points out of the window and into the approaching metro.
As it rises out of the city, it seems to bring the promise that someday Oklahoma City will fill its skyline with more industries and jobs.

PARIS, France—I can count, on one hand, how many days I have left here in Paris, and it’s quite depressing. From the enchanting architecture, to the warm nights on the Seine, to the historical sights on every block, Paris has exceeded my wildest expectations in every department.
The food, however, was just as I had predicted it would be: magnifique! On every block of this city restaurants range from fast food eateries to gourmet delicatessens. In the 10 weeks that I’ve spent here, I’ve nearly gone through every type of food establishment—except for the restaurant in the Eiffel Tower. I made sure to start each day with some sort of pastry or bread from one of the three boulangeries on my block. For lunch, if I didn’t bring food that I prepared, I’d join some of my lab colleagues for some “Parisian-ized” Vietnamese food or pre-prepared frozen meals from Picard (which are surprisingly delectable). On my way home, I’d pick up a baguette to accompany whatever I’d be having for dinner. Now I can’t even fathom eating a meal without bread and cheese to wash it down.
They really weren’t lying when they said that there is practically no bad food in Paris. Even my own cooking has exponentially increased in flavor and taste. Going to the weekend market in St. Denis has allowed me to tap into the freshness of the homegrown produce and the eclectic palette of spices that the French and French immigrants are so fond of. Immigrants have played a huge part in the growth of the food scene in this city. One night I had Lebanese food, and I encountered the most tender and flavorful chicken of my life. Then I went on to dine at the weekend Conseil de Quartier Temple market, where you can find both fresh-out-of-the-ground produce and hot-off-the-skillet beef. In short, I’ve eaten well here. It will be difficult to adjust to dining hall food again, to say the least.

BEIJING, China—The first street I lived on in Beijing was a dusty back-alley called Xinming Hutong.  During my time in the city as an exchange student, I learned that hutong meant alley in Mandarin and that these alleys were traditionally lined with courtyard houses dating back to the Ming Dynasty. However, by the time I had arrived in Beijing in 2009, my Xinming “hutong” was lined with rows of identical apartments.  The word “hutong” on the street signpost had already begun to fade into a memory enveloped in the city’s ubiquitous construction dust.  Thus Xinming Hutong taught me my first lesson about Beijing: change is an inherent, almost palpable element of life here.
Nonetheless, when I returned this summer I was still surprised to see how much had changed in the two years that had elapsed since I called Beijing home. Biking through streets that I had traversed hundreds of times in my past life here, I encountered buildings and faces that seemed at once vaguely familiar and deeply altered.  In some cases my old hangouts had disappeared altogether—a sprawling cinema complex has replaced the hole-in-the-wall Korean waffle shack where I used to huddle with a cup of warm milk tea in the winter. In other cases, my old favorite neighborhoods had simply adopted new faces—an historic hutong where I used to bike past octogenarians huddled around a mahjong table at all hours now draws flocks of Beijing’s hipsters.
Yet overlooking Beijing from the city’s single hill in the central Jingshan Park, a clear axis still cuts through the golden rooftops of the Forbidden City, convincing any onlooker that the city has remained unchanged since the dynastic days. Only further out in the haze beyond the tiled roofs does the meticulous grid once again collapse into the sea of change. There you can almost see the waves of migrant workers arriving to build the next skyscrapers and feel neighborhoods crumbling under the omnipresent pressure of modernization.
With change and continuity coexisting and overlapping in this way, Beijing has always seemed a paradox to me and perhaps even a microcosm of China itself Revolution, stability, globalization, westernization, words that are thrown around in our Chinese language textbooks, are tangible here, burgeoning, clashing, and glaring in their presence and sometimes in their marked absence. I guess it is this perplexing collection of contradictions that draws millions of people here every year and that continues to bring me back.
As I prepare to return home again this weekend, I know I will find myself biking through the streets one last time, memorizing the face the city wears at this moment. But I know this time not to get too attached to that face.  Instead, I will try to remember how alive one feels, biking to beat of the Beijing’s pulse, alongside thousands of others similarly navigating the city of change.

IZMIR, Turkey—We buy a bag of stuffed mussels and sit on the grass by the water to eat them, but I can’t open the shells. My nails are too short, the mussels’ hard black mouths pursed in resistance against me, so a boy I have just met sits next to me prying the maws apart, handing me shell after shucked, rice-laden shell. He does not look at me as he passes them, enthralled by the work of his hands. His English is courteous and hesitant; my Turkish does not exist. He has a puff of black hair and a disinterested, laconic face, a macabre sense of humor and an occasional quiet grin. I feel like a child.
The grass is sticky against my thighs and grimed with cigarette butts. The men on the path throw light-up plastic toys into the air. They are the same slight missiles I have seen hawked in far-flung elsewheres along the Mediterranean this summer, from Venice, where they gleamed dully off the dirty water of the canals, to Istanbul, where they seemed held aloft by the call for prayer. I picture a Silk Road of plastic light-up toys stretching from Rome to the Pacific, miles and miles of dusty traders handing them off one by one. I want to ask my friends in India, in China, all over the world if they have seem the same thing, if we can see them from airplanes, if they have made their way to Chile, to France.
I discover that by making the right twisting motion with my hand I can actually open the mussels myself. I feel as though I should shrug off the serious boy’s ministrations, but don’t really want to. It is good to sit here accepting food from a near-stranger, languageless, watching the plastic gleams fall toward land.

BHAKATPUR, Nepal—We thought we were lost. This lonely, muddy road didn't look like the way to Hanuman Ghat, a cremation site sacred to Buddhists and Hindus in this ancient city. According to our map, the ghat was at the meeting spot of three small rivers, and a local had told us to turn at the bridge between two of them. But we were the only ones following this path, hopping over puddles and mounds of discarded trash left in the dirt, trailed by a man muttering to himself and walking in circles around us.
Then, where one river curved left, we found it. It was something I felt I couldn't fully understand, or something I didn't deserve to see: sculptures and shrines rising up from the banks, the bright flowers and colored powder left as vibrant offerings against grey stone. On the opposite banks of the river, dozens of old men sat in the wet grass, and a cloud of smoke that drifted the other way. We had intruded on this: Under the roof of an open structure, fire rose from a darkened heap, its color a bit too orange, its flames a bit too high.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Xiao-Li Meng, who as chair of the statistics department increased the concentration’s popularity among undergraduates and raised the profile of its graduate students, has been appointed dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Meng will replace classics professor Richard J. Tarrant, who has served as interim dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science’s graduate school since Dean Allan M. Brandt stepped down in February due to poor health.
Meng is the Whipple V. N. Jones Professor of Statistics and has served as the chair of the department since 2004.
“We at the statistics department are all happy for Professor Meng to be the dean of GSAS,” said S. C. Samuel Kou, co-director of graduate studies and professor of statistics. “We are all looking forward to working with him as the dean of GSAS.”
For Meng, the appointment recalled his rise from humble beginnings as a college student in China who came to Harvard to earn a master’s degree in 1987 and a doctorate in 1990.
“Harvard has been a dream school for generations of students around the world. GSAS made my dream come true by providing me with full financial support when I was literally a village boy on the other side of the globe,” he said  to the Harvard Gazette, adding that he wants to make the same education possible for others.
Tarrant, the interim dean, said he is confident that Meng “will be an energetic and effective advocate for the Graduate School and its students.”
“Xiao-Li Meng has a broad and deep knowledge of FAS and GSAS from his service on key committees such as the Faculty Council, the Educational Policy Committee, and the Graduate Policy Committee,” he said in an email to The Crimson.
During Meng’s tenure as chair of the statistics department, the concentration grew from 16 undergraduate concentrators in 2007 to 75 in 2011, the earliest and latest years for which information is provided in the student handbook. He taught the popular Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 16: “Real Life Statistics: Your Chance at Happiness (or Misery),” a course geared toward making statistics appealing.
From 2007 to 2011, the Derek C. Bok Award for Excellence in Graduate Student Teaching of Undergraduates, awarded to five teaching fellows annually, went to a statistics graduate student each year.
“He has provided amazing leadership for the statistics department and has really been a leader in the training of graduate students as future faculty,” said Terry Aladjem, executive director of the Bok Center. “He’s a true educator who works in extraordinarily effective ways with graduate students and faculty and is just a phenomenal choice for this position, and we couldn’t be more delighted.”
