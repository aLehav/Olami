After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tattoos and I have had a long, tu­multuous relationship. It all started back in elementary school when I was utterly obsessed with Jack Spar­row. One day, while watching a rerun of “Inside the Actors Studio,” I heard Johnny Depp recount the tale of his infamous tattoo. If you haven’t heard the story, it goes as such: during his bad-boy years of long, greased hair and wool beanies, paparazzi temper tantrums, and 3:00 am appearances at LA nightclub The Viper Room, the ac­tor dedicated his beautifully sculpted deltoid to his then-girlfriend, Winona Ryder, getting “Winona Forever” en­graved in capital letters. To my pre­teen self, it was a bold and foreign move, romantic and cool. It was also utterly stupid. Like many young Hol­lywood lovers, the two stars eventu­ally split, and Depp had no choice but to rescind his mark of affection. He went and got the “na” removed, revis­ing the words to “Wino Forever.” So began my tattoo dilemma.
For many of us, college is a period of experimentation, self-exploration, and risk-taking. Our bodies are no exception to this. Just yesterday, a friend of mine began winter hiberna­tion early by growing unprecedented facial hair. I have learned more about the anatomy of the ear from listening to my peers choose between daith and tragus piercings than from my high school biology classes. Yet, through­out my time at Harvard, I have found that most individuals fall into one of several categories when it comes to the issue of tattoos: there are those who staunchly claim stretch marks, professional advancement, and cur­sive ink do not mix well and that re­gret is inevitable; there are those who don’t see what the big deal is—a tat is a tat, the more the better; and then, there’s me.
As a painter and artist, I have al­ways found the visual aspect of the tattoo provocative. The notion that through text, image, and color the body can become a canvas is extremely powerful. Even more profound is the idea that one can self-impose an aes­thetic statement, overtly displaying an act of self-transformation through physical skin mutation. The tattoo is a personal badge, a narrative, a history, a particular declaration of individual and perhaps collective identity.
Nonetheless, while it is true that we are constantly expressing our­selves— whether through our govern­ment papers or Facebook status up­dates, our clothing or haircuts—there is something unsettling about carry­ing one single moment of this very expression on one’s body forever. Just as Depp fell out of love with Winona, what if I fall out of love with my tat­too? Does this mean I have somehow betrayed my younger, former self ? Will I have to prepare some explana­tion when people ask what it means?
The ability to play and be adven­turous in my self-expression while simultaneously being conscious about the lasting consequences of these acts is at the heart of my thoughts on both tattoos and creative freedom. Ironi­cally, most artists long for perma­nence, trusting and hoping that their work and message will persist long after their careers and lives end. The weight of this permanence inevitably calls for long contemplation, the toil of creation, and careful modes of dis­play. But if you ask any artist, the im­pulse to create a lasting mark is also instinctive and reckless, inevitably opening up the very act of art-making to the fault and foolishness of some­thing like “Wino Forever.”
Looking back, I’ll admit to having entertained a few embarrassing tattoo ideas: the rose-chained anklet, which I would never have to remove when showering; the “profound” Oscar Wil­de quote, whose brevity and aphoris­tic punch began to feel too easy and disingenuous over time; the tradition­al Chinese seal of my surname, which I abandoned after realizing I should probably learn to read and write Man­darin first.
Last year I finally thought I could break through the unhealthy cycle of infatuation, fallout, make-up, and to­tal abdication when I came across the idea of getting the Egyptian symbol, Ka, tattooed on my upper-back. The Ka was said to be the soul’s vital es­sence, that which distinguished life from death. It was a beautiful concept, and I was ready to commit.
Yes! I was ready to com­mit…that is, until I showed my friend a Google image of the hieroglyph, which is represented by two upraised arms. Her reaction: “It looks like a foot­ball touchdown sign.” The visual similarities were undeniable. Even as someone who had only watched the Super Bowl for the commercials and halftime show, I felt like an idiot for not having noticed.
For the time being, I remain tat­too-free, continuing to search for the perfect mark. Perhaps a time will come when I will finally settle down on one mode of self-expression. I can only hope that that moment will not only contain meaningful history and retro­spective insight, but also set into mo­tion a series of shifting perceptions and new emotional experiences that might include pleasure, fondness, nostalgia, or even regret.

As the booze- and nostalgia-fuelled train that is senior year pulls away from the platform, I find myself looking longingly at the college landscape racing past the windows. The thought of my destination, that nebulous, uninviting thing called the “real world,” fills me with dread. In the “real world,” there is very little time for the concept that has become a religion for me and many of my peers during our four years here: the belief that leisure time, time spent doing absolutely nothing, is sacrosanct.
This idea is so institutionalized that the very thought of class on Friday fills most students with horror. This summer I worked in a particular industry, which I will neglect to name here, in which not only Fridays but (gasp!) even Saturdays and Sundays were fair game for work. It was with a heavy heart and heavier footsteps that I dragged myself—literally, I was on crutches for most of the summer—to the office many a weekend, knowing how ludicrous it was for me to be there at all. In Harvard land, weekend class work is as alien as arriving on the hour for section.
But lo and behold as I entered the office there were other people in this harshly-lit, over air-conditioned wasteland of PCs. There were other people working on the weekend, a concept that violated every fibre of my being. I sat down at my desk and half expected my chair to eject me, as if it, too, scoffed at my presence here on a Saturday. I attempted to turn on my computer. Surely this won’t work, I thought. The power must be off on the weekend. But sure enough, my impersonal windows desktop flickered into view, along with several emails from my various bosses, sent earlier that day. They’re all aliens, I concluded.
Why do Harvard students believe this right to leisure is so, if you will, inalienable? Just what is it about student life that makes us feel so entitled to downtime? It’s not as though we work that hard. Admittedly, I am a senior, and therefore perhaps on the low end of the workload spectrum, but I am by no means taking an easy course load. My total class time for the week comes in at under 10 hours, as does my sister’s. She is a freshman.
In the real world, 10 hours of work a week would barely pay enough to buy you a fancy meal, let alone a fancy Harvard education. Let’s do some quick math. “Math, in the Arts section?” you ask, horrified. Don’t worry, you can handle it. Just some quick multiplication and division, and then you can get back to your leisure time. If you can’t be bothered, and leisure time is beckoning in that irresistible way it has of making you cheat on productivity, then just put down the paper right now. I won’t tell. No one’s making you read this article. In fact, you’re doing The Crimson a favour by reading it.
Okay, if you’re still with me, let’s do that math. My on-campus job pays me $13 an hour.If I were to work 10 hours a week, I would make $130 a week. A Harvard education costs about $50,000 a year. So it would take me 385 weeks, or seven years, of working at that rate to pay for one year of college, excluding the cost of keeping me alive for those seven years. So in other words, if I were compensated $13 for every hour of class I attend, I would earn about 13 percent per year of the annual cost of keeping me here. That’s nothing!
So why do we feel like we are doing people a favor by gracing lectures with our presence? Why do we feel like we deserve brownie points just for showing up to class? Why do I reward myself for turning in an assignment with hours of TV and rounds and rounds of drinks?
Far be it from me to bash free time. I spend most of my day trying to maximize it. I believe it is both necessary and valuable, and ultimately makes you better at whatever it is you are trying to do. But one can have too much of a good thing. One can have an excess of idleness. It’s not something you really need to learn, which is why I am baffled by the existence of Visual and Environmental Studies 80: “Loitering.” The class description reads, “You will hang out in the vicinity of culture… This class is not linked to any particular discipline.” Well, I already take “Loitering.” It has been my fifth class since freshman year. And it’s the one class I always show up to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You find yourself in a room with a computer. There are advertisements on the screen and in one of them, the largest, you see her—a big, busty elf rigged out in leather like “Xena: Warrior Princess.” Solemn as Moses, she proffers a pair of stone tablets with the inscription: “Thrive in Xabulia: Free Trial.”
It is here, you will later decide, that you made a mistake.
But you are, at present, otherwise engaged. Epiphany has thrown up its hands, rolled its eyes in disgust, and passed you by. You are scrolling through the available races—blue people, purple people, lightning people, fungus people—and comparing their race bonuses. The dwarves are always loyal. The bad guys are often dark-skinned. It might even be that that the tall, blonde “high elves” receive a few points’ intelligence bonus, but that is neither here nor there. You have just begun to exist.
Like characters in Stoppard or Beckett, you arrive on scene bewildered and bereft of past. You are badly dressed. You are badly informed. You are not yet a prisoner of the game—its monthly payments, its agonizing downtimes, its expansion-pack schemes—but there are numbers in your name already, portending ill. No matter—you set out.
You begin in a kind of town square where people are standing around, armed to the teeth. Some of them are like you—broadsword-wielding infants of cyberspace, struggling for control of their fresh and tender limbs. There is hustle, there is bustle, the screen brims with the lexical effluvia of vendors hawking “cRyStAl sw00rds,” and “minotaur $hields.” You realize eventually that nobody is speaking to you, that nobody has the slightest interest in you at all, that you have nothing to offer anyone. You are an unknown entity, some archetype or other’s barely-customized clone. The money you have is barely enough. But for what?
You figure you have two choices. The first is to play the game for months, applying yourself to an endless variety of tedious jobs involving superficially different quest-robots that say such thrilling things as, “Friend, I need your assistance.” The second is to purchase “virtual currency,” or whole virtual people from the resident cottage industry of forum-skulking avatar pimps. But that’s not for you. You embrace what is called, with suspect fondness, “the grind.”
You set about killing everything that moves. Bevies of modeled monstrosities collapse, becoming corpse-wallets ready for your pilfering pointer finger. It’s fantastic. You kill everything so fast you have to wait for the world to excrete more. And you take a break. You go to microwave something, or to massage the ligaments of your denaturing eyes. You might even turn off the game. But a tentacle is growing between you and the screen—a physical feeling, the sort of awareness a suckling baby must have of its mother’s teat. You begin to perceive an obstacle between you and the game, and you feel it, like someone has stepped on your tail. And you keep coming back, for months.
Eventually, almost asymptotically, you arrive. Tier by tier through the polygon menagerie, you make your brutal ascent. You become that glowing guy, admired by all, attuned to the gameworld and its rhythmic bowel movements of monsters and loot. It’s nice, for a while. But ultimately you leave, maybe out of boredom, maybe to become a forum-skulking character vendor yourself. Or maybe the empty suits crawl out from under the curtain and stuff the universe back into its briefcase. In other words, maybe the game leaves you. If you’re lucky, you’re only fourteen.
Was it worth it? Should you go back? The temptation arises from time to time. But with discipline you remember that Xabulia has very little to recommend it. You remember how it drains you, how it warps your systems of reward. You remember the cheaters, the enticing advertisements, the repetitive obligatory tasks. You remember the monthly payments to the owners of the world, the Malthusian struggle for skills and baubles and loot. And you say to yourself: forget Xabulia. There’s quite enough of all that on Earth.

My favorite way to break up with people is by letter.
No, that’s not true. Rather, the only way I know how to break up with people is by letter. There’s simply something about that highly charged, traumatically emotional, in-person exchange that I can’t handle: the desperate reading of facial expressions, the vulnerable body language, the nervous shaking, the words—confused and incoherent—forced upwards through a constricted throat, threatening asphyxiation.
There’s a certain catharsis to communicating through letters. Alone in your room, pen in one hand and gin and tonic (mostly gin) in the other, you can craft your thoughts precisely as you want to express them—rational, truthful, perhaps even kind. More importantly, there’s the hope of amnesia: You finish your inebriated ramblings, fold up your letter, seal the envelope, and assure yourself that those words are for someone else now, never again for your critical self-examination, your retrospective embarrassment and sentimental regret. It’s the casting of ashes into a fast-flowing river.
But the utility of letters is not limited to cowardly break-ups. It seems to me an art that is slowly fading, and I lament its demise not because I’m a sentimental and nostalgic Luddite (though I am), but because there are real and pragmatic reasons for holding onto an anachronistic tradition.
In “A Letter to a Young Poet,” Virginia Woolf defends the penny post against the charge of having killed the art of letter-writing, commenting that the cheapness of posting a letter allowed writers to be “intimate, irreticent, indiscreet” and to fill their correspondence with quirky, lighthearted anecdotes, to hop, skip and jump from one random topic to another. There’s no doubt in my mind that this is even more true for emails, Facebook wall posts, Google chats, and Twitter feeds. There’s energy and vibrancy, immediacy and excitement, and nothing replaces the comfort of seeing and speaking to friends and family over Skype—that feeling of being intimately connected to people thousands of miles away. But there is also something completely different in the way we communicate through writing that permits greater honesty and reflection—the qualities I turn to when I can’t adequately break up with someone in person.
To begin with, there’s the moment when you start a letter and you think carefully about what to write. Letters, unlike emails, demand continuity and direction: There’s no way to write half a sentence, finish another paragraph, jot down a thought about something else, then return to finish your sentence. It requires discipline that is so often neglected in schizophrenic email drafts that you can always write first and organize later.
If you’re writing more formally to a friend with whom you’re only sporadically in contact, there’s the need to reflect holistically upon your life as you map out what you want to say: thinking carefully about what you’ve been doing and thinking in the past weeks, months, or years, since you last wrote to them.
Letters are sacrificial gifts of the most selfless kind: they’re written and given away with no hope of return, and much as I’ve been tempted (in my narcissism and eternal fear of forgetting) to make a copy of my letters before I send them, I’ve never succumbed to the temptation. There’s something sacred about giving away your words, an act of abandonment that is at once saddening and liberating, like when a friend of mine once cast the only copy of a poem she wrote into the Charles River tied to a metal fork.
In a world where Facebook and Whatsapp annoyingly tell you when your messages have been viewed by their recipient, letters have a delightful built-in delay mechanism. For those brief days or weeks just after they’ve been posted, they exist in a liminal space between sender and receiver: traveling in boats, planes, and vans, through package depots and sorting offices, until they eventually reach their destination. Letters don’t demand immediate attention; they encourage patience and permit a quiet lull between receiving a letter and deciding whether you’re ready to open it and read it, or whether you want to save it and savor it elsewhere.
And, of course, there’s the beauty of the object in itself. Much as I love the tactility of newspapers, magazines, and, above all, books, letters are in a league of their own. The care and deliberation that has gone into producing every word and sentence exclusively for your viewing; the orthographic scrawl that modulates and hints at the moment of composition, the writing that disintegrates as the writer’s hands get tired, that changes as they pause to think of what to say next and then begin writing again, the crossed out words and Freudian slips, the splash of a coffee-stain, the remnants of their morning croissant—these are the letter’s tiny tokens of triumph over electronic mail.
So some time during this week, month, year, pick up a pen, grab some paper, and write to an old childhood friend, a forgotten relative, a long-distance lover, far away somewhere, anywhere. There will be, I promise, a sense of satisfaction when you finish your letter, sign off, seal it, and send it away. And that’s without even considering the great pleasure it will give to your intended recipient, and the hope of one day, perhaps, receiving a reply.

If you search online for the term “starving writer,” Google returns over 8 million results—about the same as a search for “English bull terrier.”  This may not come as much of a surprise: after all, it’s a dog-eat-dog world.
Clearly, the figure of the starving writer occupies an important place in our culture. This figure represents the intense, painful pursuit of a passion over material concerns. Writing doesn’t pay; his hunger is proof of his authenticity.
Each year, many Harvard students with literary interests come up against this cultural type. It’s the purest form of the “passion versus paycheck” dilemma: Do I do what I love for no money, or do I go after a more lucrative but so-called “soulless” career path?
Despite the prevalence of the “starving writer” image, I believe that students with literary interests do not need to conceive of our choices in these terms. A body of undergraduates with interests in both literature and business are finding innovative ways to move past this binary.
Stephanie L. Newman ’13 is one such student. An English concentrator, she is the publisher of the literary magazine The Harvard Advocate (of which I am also a member) and a former executive board member of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business. She spent the summer as the interim managing editor of online content for a tech start-up. This semester, she is using her leadership of the Advocate as an opportunity to help members of the magazine, some of whom might otherwise be starving writers in training, think in new ways about their career possibilities.
“The lines are blurring,” Newman told me. “The [publishing] industry is becoming very fluid now. I think that there's a lot happening behind the scenes, things that aren't visible to students, because they’re not changes that we see in big name, old-model publishing companies . . . There are exciting opportunities there for students who are literary minded to get their feet wet in something that is content-related.” She cited the growing number of online publications and digital media firms, such as Oyster (which aims to be a “Spotify of books”) and Activate (a new media consulting firm), as prime examples of these changes.
Newman planned an event at the Advocate last month to bring professionals whose careers are proving her claim or, in her words, “to give Advocate members a sense of what is happening now with digital media and how that interacts with developments in the literary world” and to “get people thinking about their postgraduate lives in different ways.”
Not every student organization is finding ways to help people pursue literary careers that avoid the “starving writer” cliché. The Harvard Crimson’s annual Journalism and Media Fair, held last week and co-sponsored by the Office of Career Services, targets students who want to enter these fields, but it’s unclear what the benefits to students or employers are. As one senior member of the news board told me, students in the Crimson joke that no one knows if the employers they bring to campus year after year can actually afford to hire anyone for more than an unpaid internship.
Yet student organizations aren’t the whole story. Escaping the “passion versus paycheck” mentality, when it comes to a literary career, will also require that students let go of some of the pretensions and assumptions that older writers have handed down. When I spoke with students for this article, some expressed doubt that an English concentrator would have the necessary skills to forge new career paths. Still others turned up their noses at the idea of a day job that wasn’t a conventional first writerly job, like copy editing at a magazine or working as an editorial assistant at a publishing house. “T. S. Eliot’s being a starving writer was part of how he became T. S. Eliot,” one student said.
He’s wrong, though. Eliot worked as a bank clerk for years before becoming an editor at Faber & Faber. Wallace Stevens worked as an executive at an insurance company. William Carlos Williams was a doctor. There doesn’t need to be an inherent contradiction between having active but distinct professional and literary lives, just as literary skills and interests can help individuals develop a unique and innovative career path.
Work like what Newman is doing at the Advocate may help the next generation of Harvard writers prove in new ways that these ideas are true. “I also just wanted our members to know that other people are going through similar struggles, people from arts background and humanities backgrounds, and dealing with it in really creative ways,” Newman told me. “They're not just working at [newspapers and publishing houses] or in finance. They’re finding an in-between area.”

Over the past few days, alarming protests have taken place throughout the northeastern Spanish region of Catalonia. These protests, which began as an effort to condemn the austerity measures of Spanish Premier Mariano Rajoy, have swiftly developed into a full-fledged independence movement—perhaps the most legitimate independence movement that Western Europe has seen in decades. The Catalan crisis is more than an isolated case, however. Instead, it points to key economic and cultural weaknesses in the most basic elements of the European political system.
The key problem in Catalonia is economic. A wealthy region, Catalonia produces about a fifth of Spain’s GDP and contains about 16 percent of Spain’s population. Due to Catalonia’s wealth, it contributes more in taxes to Spain’s central government than it receives back.
This inequality in tax policy has recently angered regional citizens because Catalonia has been hit especially hard by the current financial crisis. Though it remains the most productive and wealthy of Spain’s seventeen regions, it also has incurred the most debt, and Catalonian Premier Artur Mas was forced to beg Madrid for a bailout. Catalonia then demanded that Spain give the region more control over its tax dollars, claiming that the most productive region of the country should not give more in taxes than it receives back only to be forced to beg for a bailout.
When the Spanish government refused this demand, Mas declared that independence could be put on the table should Madrid refuse to acquiesce. He further set a date for new elections, in which parties seeking independence (or at least much greater autonomy) are expected to make large gains. Protests originally intended to counter austerity turned into pro-independence rallies, and now, more than fifty percent of Catalans claim to support secession.
The problem in Catalonia, far from isolated, points to a wider problem with both economic and cultural components. Economically, the current recession is tearing Europe apart both among and within its constituent states. On the European level, the crisis threatens the fabric of Europe itself. The European Union has become a bastion of disunity and discord. The Euro is in danger of collapse, nations are grappling for power, and protests have seized the continent. Furthermore, the newly apparent fragility of nation-states like Spain has had adverse effects on international markets, which could further fuel separatist movements while also disrupting the economies of Europe and the world.
The greater problem with Europe’s political system, however, is cultural, and nowhere is this more apparent than in Catalonia. In reality, most of Europe’s “national” cultures are mere political constructions. Some countries have become more homogeneous than others, but some—especially Spain—are basically multiple diverse nations grouped together under a central government. Regional tensions were muted in the era before the European Union because Europe’s governments were so nationalistic—the Franco government, for example, put severe restrictions on public displays of Catalonian language and culture.
With the European Union’s ascent, however, nationalism has seen a marked decrease in Europe, which has allowed regional cultures to thrive. Catalan language and culture have reemerged strong from the Franco years, and with them has come a robust sense of Catalan nationalism. As a Catalan friend told me, her pride and nationalism for Catalonia is constant, while her loyalty to Spain ebbs and flows. Lately, she has found herself more and more sympathetic to the idea of independence—an idea she claims was rarely voiced in public only a few decades ago. She, like many Catalans, resents that her language is viewed as secondary to Castilian Spanish, that Madrid collects taxes on her region, and that her nation’s rich culture often goes unknown on the world stage because there is no internationally-recognized government to support it. Catalonia has its own cultural, linguistic, and historical legacy—a legacy that instills pride and patriotic fervor in its people.
And so, two phenomena—one economic, one cultural—have combined to create the strongest possibility in decades for a new state in Western Europe. Many Catalans, proud of their national culture and resentful of Spanish fiscal policy, feel that they can succeed as a cultural and economic force. As Catalonian Premier Artur Mas recently pointed out, were Catalonia independent, it would be among the top fifty exporting nations in the world.
Catalan independence is a real possibility, which shows that our traditional ways of thinking about Europe—chiefly our idea that its states are stable, culturally homogeneous entities—may well be false. Although the Catalan independence movement is the strongest of its kind currently, it is far from the only secessionist movement active on the continent. Many regions in Europe have similar histories of cultural autonomy or even independence, and many also feel that they contribute much more to their central government than they get back economically. Scotland, Flanders, Padania, Bavaria, and Brittany (among others) are all home to secessionist movements of varying levels of power.
If the current economic recession continues to exacerbate the nationalistic fervor within these regions, the map of Europe as we know it could soon be redrawn. An independent Catalonia may well be the change that sets off such a chain of events.

For a program as associated with the civil rights era of nearly 50 years ago, affirmative action has been shoved uncomfortably back into the public spotlight. In a major case debating the merits of the system, Abigail Fisher, has brought a case to the Supreme Court arguing that she was rejected from the University of Texas at Austin based on her race (she is Caucasian), which, she argues, is unconstitutional.
As we have argued in the past, the principle of affirmative action should stand and continue to be a legal practice in U.S. higher education. Harvard filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in favor of affirmative action, which we unequivocally affirm. But instead of arguing in favor of the legal justifications behind affirmative action, which are better left to the lawyers in front of the Supreme Court, we make the case for the social and economic logic behind the practice.
Affirmative action, which effectively began in 1961 President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which was and is designed to allow university admissions to alleviate the education disadvantage of low-income applicants from minority backgrounds. While great strides have been made nationwide to make college campuses more representative of the demographic diversity of the U.S., massive progress remains to be done: Teach For America recently reported that only eight percent of students below the poverty line will graduate from college. For all the rhetoric behind the inclusiveness of classes at elite schools like Harvard, access to a good education is still largely socio-economically determined. Harvard remains a largely upper middle class institution, and people of color remain disproportionately affected by this problem.
 
Affirmative action remains relevant not only because racial minorities bear the brunt of economic inequality in the U.S., but also because institutionalized racism continues to systematically disadvantage people of color from all economic backgrounds. Students at the University of Texas at Austin—the very university that Fisher is suing for its use of affirmative action in admissions—have recently come under fire for launching bleach-filled balloons at individuals of color. Many believe the attacks to be racially motivated, and this controversy is a particularly salient testament to the persistence of racism in the U.S.
This type of incident is certainly an extreme example of the disadvantages facing low-income and minority young people. Yet 51 years later, affirmative action continues to serve a valuable purpose in seeking to create a more equally educated society, one in which we continue to hope that equal career opportunities might be available to everyone who has grown up in the U.S. While we have come a long way since the civil rights era, there is no question that race still matters.

Cats make wonderful pets, and petite, fluffy, house decorations. But as much as I adore cats, there is something special about owning a pet cow. Sathya (that is my cow's name) spends his afternoons grazing on my grandmother's lawn in a tiny lagoon village in Sri Lanka. He has brown, soulful eyes, and a voracious appetite for ripe bananas. He was also bought from an abattoir—waiting, a mere shadow of a soul beating through his malnourished frame, for what would have been his imminent death.
Sathya is the reason I choose not to eat beef. Sathya is the reason why I skip the roast beef entrée on Mondays, and do not indulge in the “less meat” offered by Harvard University Dining Service's recent initiative "Less Meat Monday" (which offers two vegetarian entrées on Mondays instead of one). Yet the HUDS initiative echoes another campaign, a campaign that we should certainly consider committing to fully —"Meatless Monday.”
The notion of "meatless meals" has been a topic that has stirred or preoccupied the minds of many Harvard students, dating back to 1975. In fact, the past few years have seen a considerable increase in the number of people who turn to “flexitarianism,” a diet that maintains the benefits of vegetarianism by requiring only a reduction, and not an omission, of meat consumption.
Meatless Monday, an initiative of The Monday Campaigns and Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health, was set up in 2003 with the aim of decreasing meat consumption by 15 percent. Their campaign has since had a global ripple effect, sprouting similar initiatives in countries such as France and Korea. Their motivation for the avoidance of meat goes beyond the traditional reasoning of lessening the risk of preventable diseases and conditions. They barely touch on ethical issues. Instead, Meatless Monday turns our attention to the toxic effects of the meat industry on the environment.
In 2006, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization released an unsettling report called “Livestock’s Long Shadow,” exposing the environmental consequences of consuming meat and urging for a safer, less harmful diet. The report states that livestock are responsible for at least 18 percent of the greenhouse gases linked to climate change. However, an article in World Watch Magazine suggests that this number may be underestimated; that the total percentage of GHG emissions appears closer to 51 percent.
Further environmental damage is generated through the meat industry's drainage of resources. Over 8 percent of the world's fresh water supply is being depleted to rear livestock. Between 20-70 percent of land has also been degraded due to overgrazing and erosion. Thus, deforestation and other land exploitations, fossil fuel consumption, the substantial drainage of the world's fresh water supply, and the large release of greenhouse gases have led to the UN’s declaration of the livestock sector as being “one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.”
Yet even as our resources dwindle, Oxfam suggests that the approaching decades will generate a need for up to 70 percent more produce due to a growing population, and thus an effective shift in our diet is required if we want to protect our environment, as well as feed a burgeoning society. One way of tackling this issue is by reducing the amount of meat we consume. But with meat farmers expecting to double their production by 2050, the chances of an efficacious shift occurring appear slim.
However an even greater cause for concern is this: When a recent interoffice newsletter advising employees to consider adopting the Meatless Monday diet circulated within the United States Department of Agriculture, it caused an outcry from meat producers and government officials. It comes as no surprise that in the face of tweets by meat farmers and congressmen alike, the USDA released a statement that they in no way endorse Meatless Monday; that the advice was posted "without proper clearance." Clearly, shunning support for a meat-reduced diet, which would engender personal health and environmental benefits, consolidates their mission statement of “improving nutrition and health by providing food assistance and nutrition education and promotion."
Without official backing, converting to a more meat-free intake is also rendered less persuasive because of the public interest in low-carb diets. Diets such as Atkins that stress reducing carbohydrate intake deter people from removing meat from their diet. However, recent studies show that the optimal diet is not one that is rich in proteins, but one that includes fewer unhealthy carbs, fat, red meat and processed foods. Eating vegetables, fruits, and other plant produce leads to numerous health benefits and even weight loss.
And if you are still feeling a little hesitant about completely throwing away that old, discoloring Big Mac in your refrigerator and becoming vegetarian, you could consider flexitarianism, which has been highlighted as one of 2012's top five consumer health trends. The Meatless Monday initiative is definitely one worth adopting, and the looming threats bred by the intake of meat make me second-guess my decision to slather bacon onto a plate during Sunday brunch. But will it overcome all the factors holding it back and finally convince me to commit? Perhaps it requires the further purchase of a pet chicken and a pet pig.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
African-Americans are less likely to develop major depression than White Americans, but those that do are likely to have more severe symptoms, said Harvard School of Public Health professor David R. Williams in a discussion on American and international health disparities this Thursday.
The statistic was one of many that Williams and other public health experts discussed in “Eliminating Health Disparities: Transdisciplinary Perspectives,” a series of two panel events that analyzed inequalities in health for those in poverty and in minority groups.
“There has been this conundrum for a long time about why people of lower incomes...have different outcomes,” said University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who introduced the event.
The first panel investigated the gap in health between minority or lower income groups and the rest of the population, and why the gap exists. Harvard College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, one of the four speakers in this first discussion, focused her discussion on history’s role in driving racial disparities in the present day.
The second panel’s five speakers explored potential solutions to these disparities in health through action in the public policy arena.
Event co-chair and panelist Alexandra E. Shields, the director of the Harvard/MGH Center on Genomics, Vulnerable Populations, and Health Disparities, said the motivation of organizing the discussions was to raise awareness and understanding of differences in people’s health.
“Disparities remain persistent, dramatic, seemingly intractable,” Shields said. “Harvard has a lot of intellectual capital, disciplinary expertise, and resources that we could bring to bear to the problem. We hoped that this event would catalyze a renewed effort across schools and disciplines to find novel ways to contribute to understanding and addressing disparities.”
Julian M. Thomas, a fourth-year medical student who attended the event, thought the panels offered a new perspective on an old problem in medicine.
“I thought the panel was very informative and beneficial to walk through the different lenses people use to look at health disparities,” Thomas said.
Eve M. Nagler, a research assistant at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, said she found the panel thought-provoking and noted that she especially appreciated that the second panel discussed not only health disparities but also its potential solutions.
“They did an excellent job really laying out the playing field of, ‘Here is what the situation of health disparities are,’” Nagler said. “I was most inspired by the solutions in that they ended on a word of optimism.”

Cell phones are the latest tool epidemiologists have for fighting infectious diseases.
The novel technique—dubbed digital epidemiology—takes center stage in a new study published today in Science which tracks 15 million Kenyans with cell phone data to determine how population movement patterns influence the spread of malaria. The study was done by researchers at eight institutions including the Harvard School of Public Health.
“Every time someone uses their phone to call or text, we have an approximate location of that person and we can build up a picture of how they are travelling over time. Combining that data with a malaria prevalence map we can calculate a kind of movement map for malaria,” said Caroline Buckee, one of the paper’s authors.
Buckee, who is an HSPH assistant professor of epidemiology, explains the value of studying malaria.
“Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease but it kills 1 million people, mostly children, a year. It’s a global threat. It’s important to me that we try to solve this problem.”
She said that the focus of this study—the geographic spread of the disease—is crucial for understanding the transmission of malaria as a whole. According to Buckee, this study shows that traditional approaches to malaria control, which involve focusing on reducing disease in particular areas, are not sufficient.  Instead, it is important to study how malaria travels through areas.
“When people travel to areas with mosquitoes, they can become infected and bring back malaria to others. This undermines control programs. [Our study identifies] the high-risk areas for malaria parasites,” Buckee said.
One of these high-risk areas is Kenya’s Lake Victoria region. The research showed that there is a large eastward migration of malaria from this region to the nation’s capital Nairobi.
According to Buckee, Kenya was chosen as the subject of this study because its level of malaria prevalence is very geographically varied, it has excellent data on the disease’s spread, and nearly all Kenyans have cell phones.
Buckee also has similar projects in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and there is a growing interest in using similar methodologies to track mobility in the developed world.
“There’s a lot of interest in tracking people,” said Buckee. “It has definite applications to questions about healthcare and infrastructure. You can study how people respond to natural disasters. In Haiti they used this method to figure out how people were moving around after earthquake.”

The room fell silent seconds before Science Center mail clerk Johany Pilar spoke at the panel discussion on gender inequality on “rape culture” on Wednesday.
“Maybe you don’t remember me,” she began softly. “But I have been here for a really long time.”
Pilar clutched at her throat, which was hurting, and asked the more than 20 students who had gathered in a tiny Boylston classroom to be patient with her. Though her every word required obvious effort, she wanted to be heard.
“I am here because what happened to me could happen to you tomorrow,” she said. “I don’t want that.
”Late last February, Pilar said, she became the victim of sexual harassment by one of her co-workers in the freshman mailroom. She said her co-worker, “bigger and older” than her, grabbed her face between his thumb and pointer finger and said that he wanted to kiss her.
Pilar said that she felt uncomfortable and immediately told her co-worker not to touch her again. Despite apologizing after the first incident, she said, the man repeated the same behavior again just a few days later.
“He did it again. He grabbed my face,” Pilar said, mimicking the man’s grip on her face with her own hand. “He did it again!”
Pilar said she then contacted a female manager of University Mail Services about the harassment by email. Pilar said that in response, the manager told her to stop hugging people and to try to be nice and work professionally. No action was taken against her co-worker, she said.
In April, Pilar said, the same co-worker grabbed her hand twice. She reported that incident to another mail services supervisor, who said that he would reassign the man so he would no longer come in contact with her, Pilar said.
Overcome by stress due to the harassment, she said, she started seeing a therapist and was admitted to Mount Auburn Hospital after a panic attack in May. She felt that she was being pressured by managers because she had reported the harassment; in September, she said, she received a written message informing her that she could be fired for an unreported absence.
“I’m not going to shut my mouth. I’m not afraid,” she said. “I’m not doing this for me to be in the mailroom working, but for justice.”
Wednesday evening marked the first time that Pilar spoke about her sexual harassment experience in a public forum, and she plans to continue to make her story public. At the panel, hosted by the International Women’s Rights Collective and several other organizations to discuss gender inequality, Pilar asked students for their support. A flyer handed out at the panel said that on Oct. 18, students will gather at the Holyoke Center to support Pilar and “stand up against gender discrimination, sexual harassment, & for their right to fair and equal treatment on the job.”
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers representative Geoffrey Carens, who is helping Pilar make her story known, was also present at the event.
“Johany has really taken it on the chin for what she has done,” he said. “She has been incredibly, incredibly brave.”
Carens said that he helped Pilar file a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination at the beginning of the month. That complaint will be assigned to an investigator in the state office.
Meanwhile, Pilar is involved in the grievance filing process through HUCTW as well. Bill Jaeger, the director of HUCTW, said privacy rules prevented him from discussing Pilar’s case specifically. But he commented, “We have a union management grievance process that we really believe in, that works extremely well to bring about fair outcomes.”
Pilar, who is originally from the Dominican Republic, said she has previously faced domestic violence. Working at Harvard since 1998, she said she has maintained a spotless disciplinary record.
Students at the event said that they saw Pilar’s story as an isolated incident reflecting harassment that happens frequently among college students as well.“
We don’t really talk about sexual assault even though it’s something that affects our lives. Most of the time, we even engage in ‘victim-blaming’,” said Kate Sim ’14, president of the International Women’s Rights Collective. “This is a mindset that has to be changed. How are we expected to be students here if we don’t even feel safe to speak up?”

The total number of ladder faculty in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences dropped from 722 to 712 between 2011 and 2012, a 1.4 percent contraction in the size of the faculty, according to the 2012 FAS Annual Report released last Thursday.
This marks the first decrease in ladder faculty numbers in more than a decade, although FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that administrators consider this a “one-year fluctuation.”
According to the report, the size of the FAS has expanded each year since at least 2003, though growth stalled following the 2008 financial crisis, with FAS growing by one member annually between 2009 and 2011. The report suggests that the drop is a delayed consequence of the FAS retirement package, first offered at the end of 2009. Fifteen senior faculty members retired during the 2011-2012 academic year, more than twice the average of six retirees in the preceding five years.
Administrators said that the sharp increase in the number of faculty retirees, although not wholly expected, is a result of the phased nature of the retirement plan, which allows faculty to gradually reduce their responsibilities over two to four years.
With the effects of phased retirements becoming more pronounced, some graying departments are scrambling for faculty search authorizations from the FAS dean to replenish their ranks. Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Romance Languages and Literature, and Human Evolutionary Biology are just a few of the departments who have lost or will lose senior faculty. Chairs from all of these departments said they are at some stage of the faculty search process.“
Generally, [FAS] Dean [Michael D.] Smith and Peter Marsden, the dean of social sciences, have listened to the case that we’ve made for renewing our faculty, and they have been responsive,” said Government Chair Timothy Colton, whose department anticipates three retirements by the end of this year. Colton has been authorized to undertake three searches—two for junior and one for senior faculty.
“Our big priority is renewal—hiring younger faculty members,” he said.
While departments vie for more search authorizations, Harvard is not always the top choice for recruits, and the report conceded that searches in the Sciences and at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences had an unexpectedly low yield.
Of FAS’ 43 ladder faculty offers last year, 25 have been accepted to date. It is not uncommon for new hires to defer their appointments, and only 14 of those hired last year began work this fall.
And maintaining the highest intellectual caliber is prioritized over filling vacancies. Departments whose searches prove unsuccessful can get second chances, “precisely to avoid this pattern of hiring somebody who’s not of the highest quality,” Colton said. “[Smith] won’t promise, but he says that no request for reauthorization to do it again will be unreasonably denied.”
As in past years, departments have also been affected by faculty departures to other universities. The economics department, for example, lost three senior faculty to Stanford.
The annual report was first presented to the faculty in an email and reviewed at this month’s Faculty Meeting. While the average age of faculty has increased from 55 to 57, the gender balance and ethnic composition remain fairly constant, with men outnumbering women in ladder faculty positions three to one and minorities representing seventeen percent of ladder appointments.

After nearly year of discussion and drawing up blueprints, Harvard took a major step toward restarting Allston construction projects and outlined future development plans—which include the construction of a new basketball stadium—at Thursday’s Harvard-Allston Task Force Meeting.
The details presented came from a draft of the University’s new Institutional Master Plan for Allston, an official blueprint that Harvard will submit to the Boston city government next week. The IMP draft lays out nine major proposals for Harvard’s property in neighborhood across the Charles River. It also outlines the face-lift of Harvard Stadium, the renovation and erection of several Harvard Business School buildings, and the construction of a hotel and conference center near the current Charlesview site. In addition, it designates a parcel of land in North Allston as a “mixed-use” parcel to be used for future University and community development.
Kevin Casey, Harvard vice president for public affairs and communications, stressed an oft repeated point that the new IMP draft is a “recalibration” of the previous IMP, adapted to a shorter, more practical time frame.
“This is an ambitious, doable, 10 year project—a major, transformative agenda for this area for the next 10 years,” Casey said.
This new blueprint comes five years after Harvard filed its first Institutional Master Plan for Allston development in 2007. The plan envisioned, among other things, the creation of a massive, $1 billion science complex and the transformation of Barry’s Corner into a vibrant community center. However, Harvard halted its pursuit of the lofty goals of this 30 to 50 year plan during the financial crisis of 2009. Not until 2011 did the University officially resume its Allston planning process.
The new blueprint will not include plans for the Barry’s Corner Retail and Housing Common or the re-imagined Science Complex. The Science Complex was already approved under the old Institutional Master Plan, and the Barry’s Corner project will need approval in a separate process that has not yet occured.
Jeremy L. Gibson, senior associate director of Harvard Athletics, said that the new basketball stadium, to be built between 2017 and 2022, will provide more seats for a program which has garnered increasing attention over the past few years, peaking in Harvard’s first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 66 years last spring.
Since coming to Harvard in 2007, men’s basketball head coach Tommy Amaker has led the Crimson to a 92-56 record, including back-to-back Ivy League championships. The Harvard basketball program stepped into the national spotlight more than ever before in 2012.
The Crimson won the Battle 4 Atlantis, a pre-season tournament in the Bahamas, last November before winning the first outright conference championship in program history and spending time ranked in the Top 25 en route to its first March Madness berth since 1946. Harvard sold out every home Ivy League game last season in Lavietes Pavillion, which has been the home of Harvard basketball since 1982. With a seating capacity of 2,195, Lavietes is currently the second-smallest basketball arena in the Ivy League, just 95 seats larger than Dartmouth’s Leede Arena.
Harris S. Band, Harvard’s director of physical planning, said that the creation of a new basketball venue, as well as the other projects, would not only serve the University but would also benefit the larger Allston community.
“We think all our projects serve our aspiration for the activation of the area,” Band said. “We want these places to have an intuitive connection to the community.”
Allston community members were skeptical of the placement of the University’s new basketball center, which they feared was too close to the residential section of the neighborhood.
“Sports facilities tend to be in conflict with the community...they just rub each other the wrong way,” said Task Force member and Allston resident Bruce E. Houghton. “Building a sports facility right across the street from a housing unit—I just think it’s a problem for community and community relations, and it’s a problem for Harvard.”
Residents were also concerned about new buildings’ effect on traffic flow in the neighborhood. “It seems that Harvard is looking at this in pieces but not judging the overall effect this will have in five or ten years,” said Task Force Chair Ray V. Mellone. “And that might be a problem we’re dealing with a decade from now.”
Harris acknowledged Mellone’s point, and said that the University would continue conducting analysis to ensure that the new buildings fit as seamlessly as possible into the new community.
After Harvard files its new plans, community members have the opportunity to give feedback on the plan during the next 30 days. Harvard will then resubmit the plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority, and after a 60-day commentary period, the BRA and the Boston Zoning Commission will decide whether or not approve the final IMP.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 12
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Barry's Corner Housing and Retail Commons project was approved under the old Institutional Plan for development in Allston. In fact, it will have to go through a separate approval process that has not yet occured. In addition, the article also incorrectly attributed a quotation about the interaction of sports facilities and the local community to Harvard-Allston Task Force member Paul Berkeley. In fact, Task Force member Bruce E. Houghton was quoted.

Politics might as well be a sport, given the way undergraduates applauded and hollered during the Thursday night vice presidential debate at a viewing hosted by the Institute of Politics.
But even though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Republican Congressman Paul D. Ryan sparred aggressively during the event, students largely predicted that the outcome of the debate would not affect the election greatly.
“Not many people watch vice presidential debates,” said Santiago Pardo ’16, who spent last summer campaigning for Barack Obama in Georgia, where he managed a team of high school student interns. He said that he thought the first of the presidential debates, which attract a larger audience, did not majorly change the likely outcome of the race. “It’s more of being overblown by the media.”
Matthew S. Krane ’15, who worked for Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for Massachusetts’ junior U.S. Senate seat, said that he went into the debate understanding it would have a marginal impact on his political leanings. “If it goes well, [it’s] not really important,” he said, adding that “it could push me away from Ryan” if the congressman performed poorly.
But Jim P. McGlone ’15, who worked for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s campaign over the summer, was more enthusiastic about the debate. “I’m more excited than I’ve been at any part in the campaign,” said McGlone, adding that after last week’s debate, the election “got really interesting.”
Sarah R. Siskind ’14 shared McGlone’s excitement, saying that these debates—even between the two vice president candidates—are vital. “It’s important to look at these people on stage and remember these people are a heartbeat away from the Oval Office,” said Siskind, who is also a Crimson columnist.
As political pundits rehashed the candidates’ performance in the debate, students said they were uncertain who came out favorably after the event. “I think they equally defended their views,” Julia B. Konrad ’13 said. “I really enjoyed this debate....There was much more of a delineation of views.”
Siskind argued that Ryan might have captured moderates with his performance in Thursday’s debate. “Ryan’s a very careful and calm debater,” she said, commenting that Biden was more confrontational in his approach.
Thursday’s debate, the only one between the vice presidential candidates, will be followed by a town hall debate between the presidential candidates next Tuesday.

Two weeks ago, a team of international astronomers, including researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), published a report that could corroborate Einstein’s 100-year-old theory of general relativity, around which the entire modern model of physics has taken shape.
“All in a day’s work,” joked Sheperd S. Doeleman, MIT Haystack Observatory assistant director and CfA research assistant.
Doeleman and several other CfA affiliates utilized a global array of telescopes to measure a black hole’s “point of no return,” or the innermost boundary past which all matter is irretrievably lost to gravity.
This technology could permit scientists to one day capture an image of a black hole, which would represent the first step towards testing Einstein’s theory of relativity.
“What I find so exciting about it is that we are probing a region of universe where Einstein tells us what we should see,” Doeleman said. “We’re thinking about asking the question: was Einstein right? If there is a place where Einstein’s theory could break down, my money is on its being near a black hole.”
Einstein’s theory of relativity proposes the existence of black holes, infinitesimal regions in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that no matter, not even light, can escape.
Black holes form the center of most galaxies, including the Milky Way, according to report co-author and CfA engineer Jonathan Weintroub.
About 10 percent of these black holes emit jets of radioactive particles at very high speeds.
Tracing the origin of the jet enables scientists to locate the boundary of the black hole’s region of gravitational pull, known as its event horizon.
“It marks the point at which not even light can escape the gravitational pull,” Weintroub said. “It’s not really a point of no return. It’s more of a sphere of no return.”
Unlike the black hole at the center of our galaxy, the black hole at the heart of distant galaxy Messier 87 produces these radioactive particles, and was chosen as the focus of this CfA research.
The technology employed in this study, known as the Event Horizon Telescope, simulates the magnifying effects of an earth-sized telescope by scattering an array of powerful telescopes around the globe. The readings from these telescopes are centralized in a super computer located in the MIT Haystack Observatory.
Doeleman developed a means of broadening the bandwidth of the telescope to increase the resolution of M87’s image. With three telescopes stationed in California, Arizona, and Hawaii, Doeleman and his fellow researchers effectively measured the event horizon of M87.
While Doeleman and Weintroub worked largely on the engineering and execution, astronomy professor and Director of CfA’s Institute for Theory and Computation (ITC) Avi Loeb collaborated with former ITC student Avery E. Broderick to analyze the data.
“It’s a very exciting time to be in data analysis game,” said Broderick, who teaches physics and astronomy at the University of Waterloo.
Although the small number of stations in the EHT currently limits imaging capabilities, the researchers hope to expand the array to more continents by 2015 to effectively produce an image of a black hole, Loeb said.
“That image would appear on the cover of textbooks everywhere,” Loeb said. “I’m just happy to live at such a time where we have the technology to make these leaps.”

While some Harvard students spend their Wednesday afternoons puzzling over problem sets or cramming out essay paragraphs, a handful take the M2 shuttle to the Longwood Medical Area every week for a different kind of coursework: performing surgery on pigs.
In OEB 251: “Introduction to Vertebrate Surgery”—a course taught by Director of the Harvard Animal Resources Center Arthur L. Lage—students learn everything from different surgical stitching techniques to how to administer anesthesia. Lage, who is also a professor of surgery, says his goal is to teach surgical techniques used to operate on various classes of vertebrates from mammals to birds.
“It’s like a military operation,” said Sean L. Po ’13, one student taking the course this fall. “If we don’t do this correctly, our patient could die.”
Lage said he focuses on teaching students differences between animals—such as quadrupeds versus bipeds or simple-stomached animals versus ruminants—and how to perform surgery accordingly.
“We cover anesthesia, analgesia, aseptic technique, surgical procedures, fluid therapy, surgical emergencies, antimicrobial practices, and other relevant topics,” he said.
In the course, which has been offered for more than 20 years, students learn both open surgery and minimally invasive surgery using video cameras. They practice these techniques mostly on pigs.
Lage said that the course is important for both animal welfare and research.
“I am teaching this so that students who want to make a career in the life sciences have the opportunity to develop a sound foundation in the proper way to apply surgery in research—whether it be in the laboratory setting or in field studies,” he said.
This year, Lage has invited other veterinarians, physicians, and a surgical technician to help him teach. Students spend up to seven hours in one Wednesday session.
Most students taking the course aspire to be either doctors or veterinarians.  “I still hear from former students telling me how much the course has meant to them, how it has helped them, and how it rounded out their experience in the study of biology,” Lage said.
MacKenzie L. Luick ’13 hopes to be a veterinary surgeon one day. “We learn how to do everything from take care of the animals to prep them for surgery,” she said. “It’s one of the few classes at Harvard that really applies what you learn.”
Students praised the class for its application of theory—a trait that they often find lacking in other courses.
“We can see how everything works together in a living, breathing system. It’s a hands-on experience with really skilled professionals,” Po said.

“The ‘control of Nature’ is a phrase conceived in arrogance...”
These are the wise words of Rachel Carson, whose book “Silent Spring,” about the dangers of spraying DDT and other pesticides, changed the face of environmentalism as we know it. Her eloquent prose and compelling scientific studies convinced the public to forge a path to sustainability, albeit a winding one filled with potholes and roadblocks. By the end of her life Carson had contracted cancer, yet she bravely testified before President Kennedy’s Science Advisory Committee, defending the wildlife that couldn’t defend itself.
On Sept. 27,  a panel of individuals at the forefront of the environmental movement gathered in Sanders Theater for “Science and Advocacy: The Legacy of Silent Spring,” commemorating the 50-year anniversary of the book’s release.
When I first saw the line-up, learning that the discussion would involve everyone from Bill E. McKibben ’82, environmental activist and author of “The End of Nature,” to James McCarthy, former co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, I knew I had to attend.
The moderator was Daniel P. Schrag, Director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, who studies climate change and currently serves on President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Under his guidance, the panelists discussed questions that echoed Carson herself, resonating with a need for change. I couldn’t have agreed more.
I’d been feeling a little angsty lately, slightly unfulfilled by being back on campus this fall. It’s not as if I found direct fault with the University, but I couldn’t help wondering if my time here was better spent doing something more concrete, something in “the real world” as opposed to academia. Sure, I was learning a lot from lecture, yet I still felt like a cog in a wheel rather than a student with a vision. There was clearly something amiss. The answer came to me at the end of the discussion.
The panel took the audience’s questions, written down on index cards and passed to ushers standing in the aisles. I saw one of them shuffling through the thick stack of cards and wondered, doubtfully, if my question would be selected. After Schrag asked the panelists to comment on a few general questions, he paused for a moment and his tone became more serious. For this final question, he didn’t paraphrase or extrapolate on the audience member’s wording—he read, straight from the index card, my simple question in earnest scrawl:
“How do you suggest that we—as college students—avoid the moral decisions made by previous generations—how do we alter the path we’re on?”
A silence followed, after which the first panelist—William C. Clark, ecologist, author, and Kennedy School professor—cleared his throat and said, “I think I just teared up.”
He continued, saying, “Be outraged. A lot more than you are. And master something that will let you turn that outrage into effective action.”
One by one, each panelist took a turn answering my almost child-like question that, although a natural one for me, obviously struck a chord with these experts so used to the highbrow speech of the professional world.
The panel ended with McKibben saying, although he wished he could tell me to have a good time and enjoy the next four years, that the ice shelf is already broken and that college campuses will be a central place for this fight to take place.
I wish that more students had gone to the discussion. Vain as it may sound and self-evident as it was, I wish more of my peers could have heard my question and asked themselves the same. So much of college is figuring out what we want to do with our lives. So much of the learning we do here is learning about ourselves. Yet how much of that is centered around what we should be doing, not just as citizens, but as students—students at arguably the most prestigious and powerful university in the world?
Many of us will graduate with very little clue of what we want to do long-term, and that’s okay. I’m not suggesting that we become household names by the time we receive our diplomas (although this will inevitably be the case for some of our peers). What I am suggesting is that we think about how we want to leave this place—what sort of footprint we leave. Indirectly, I suppose that could mean our carbon footprint, but also the footprint we leave on each other’s consciousness. This is an incredible campus filled with brilliant people, but unless we learn how to think and act with longer time-horizons in mind, how do we expect to shape the future in a sustainable way?
What does it take to start a movement? Just one person. That’s all it took in Rachel Carson’s time, and the same holds true today.

Invasive pests are proving to be an increasingly damaging problem for New England’s natural ecosystems as they continue to evade control efforts, according to a recent talk by Harvard Forest Director David R. Foster and Harvard Forest researcher David A. Orwig.
Pests are natural inhabitants of areas with high concentrations of trees—such as New England—but the rate of pest influxes has increased dramatically since the mid -1800s when trade was popularized, Orwig said. He is a Senior Ecologist at the Harvard Forest and has spent the last 15 years studying invasive pests.
At an earlier talk Harvard Museum of Natural History in September , Foster and Orwig discussed the threats posed by the hemlock wooly adelgid, the emerash ash borer, and Asian longhorn beetle. As commercial continues to increase, plants and material goods get moved around farther and more quickly, Orwig said.  He explained that the biggest issue in the spread of pests lies in the transport mechanisms: wooden crates.
“They come in on woody packing material in larvae and they eat their way out and they escape [...] back into our forests, and they continue to reproduce from there,” Orwig said.
Forest researchers are interested in the way these pests have not only led to the near elimination of several tree species, but also disrupted the natural interactions among many native species of plants, fungi, trees, and birds.
The hemlock woolly adelgid--an aphid-like insect-- is one of area’s most widespread pests. It was first introduced to the United States in Virginia from Japan and has been in Massachusetts since 1989, according to Orwig.
“Despite its small size, it reproduces extremely well and there is no known resistance or effective native predators,” said Orwig. “So really, it’s just continuing to wreak havoc.”
The recent influx of adelgid is larger in scale than any other historical invasion and efforts to curb the species’ growth has proven very difficult, he said.  He added that the best way to prevent pest spread is to detect pests as early as possible. Researchers at the
Harvard Forest focus on ports of entry for the pests, and once found, aim to quarantine them.
The battle against another regional pes—the Asian long-horned beetle--has proven effective in some areas due to early detection efforts.
“They found the Asian long-horned beetle at the Faulkner Hospital [in Boston], but they only had to remove six trees because they found it right away,” said Orwig. “But you look at Worcester and they’ve had to remove 30,000 trees because it took ten years to detect.”
There are chemical means to control these insects as well, but they are only useful in localized places like backyards or smaller parks.
Orwig said bio-control—the introduction of new predators to infested areas—is often ineffective because the predators usually can’t reproduce in the new habitat as well as the pests themselves.
“You go to the country of origin of these pests, and see what’s eating them over there and then we try to introduce them into our forest and see if we can get rid of them that way,” Orwig said.
But non-native predators could also prey on native organism—potentially dangerous consequence that leaves investigation of safe pest control open for further research.

A new breakthrough in cellular biology has revealed a biological “fat switch” that could help in the fight against the worldwide obesity epidemic, according to a study published by scientists at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute last week.
The “switch”—a channel-shaped protein that sits in the outer membrane of human fat cells—can help prevent insulin resistance and obesity when it is blocked.
Senior author Bruce Spiegelman, a professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School, said the implications of this research are far-extending.
“The fact that there is a pathway [...]that is potentially druggable that controls these aspects of biology opens up a pretty clear possibility to develop therapeutics,” he said.
According to co-author Jun Wu, an instructor at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, one-third of the world’s population suffers from obesity, but there are still no effective drugs in the United States capable of helping reduce metabolic rates.
In any animal, a high calorie diet can lead to obesity or insulin resistance–and commonly both. The diseases, especially when coupled, lead to greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease, type II diabetes and stroke.
The fat switch protein these scientists studied is predominately found in “brown fat cells”—a type of fat cell that is especially good at using chemical energy to generate and dissipate heat. This heat dissipation functions to prevent insulin resistance, distinguishing it as a “good” fat cell, according to Wu.
Through five years of experimentation, Spiegelman, Wu and their colleagues found that mice who had blocked fat switch proteins in their brown cells had an increase in their energy expenditure and decrease in insulin resistance compared to mice that did not have this block, even without putting the mice on a low-calorie diet.
Spiegelman said that the fat switch protein is from the same family of proteins as capsaicin, a protein that can be blocked by drugs to prevent the taste of spice—evidence that the fat switch could be manipulated to produce an effect in humans in a similar way.
The “druggable” potential for the fat switch, Spiegelman added, was one of the most exiciting finds of his work.

A big rainbow flag flapped proudly from a tent outside Memorial Hall Thursday morning, contrasting against the gray metal fences and mounds of upturned dirt that surround the Science Center lawn.
Fluttering in the wind, it reminded passersby that Thursday was National Coming Out Day.
Office of BGLTQ Student Life intern Griffin T. Gaffney ’13 said that keeping the flag up had been a constant struggle against the wind. “But we made it work,” he said. “And our flag was flying high for everyone to see.”
Tabling outside Annenberg was just one of a series of events hosted by queer organizations on campus to mark National Coming Out Day, a tradition started in 1988 to mark the anniversary of the first March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights the year before.
“It’s not necessarily a day when people come out,” Gaffney said, noting that people often misconstrue the purpose of the celebration. “It’s meant to show that the College is a safe space and that there are people who are going through and have gone through the process of coming out.”
In preparation for this day, groups ranging from the Men’s baseball team to the Undergraduate Council to the Harvard University Police Department took photos in support of queer students with the iconic rainbow flag.
Director of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey said that this was an obvious testament to the supportive atmosphere that exists on campus for queer students.
“National Coming Out Day is a day of celebration and rich dialogue,” Bailey said, sporting several rainbow-colored pins throughout the day. “It’s a representation of freedom, civility, and visibility.”
This was the first year the newly-created Office of BGLTQ Student Life took part in planning the festivities.
In past years, Queer Students and Allies took charge of organizing the activities for the day, which mainly consisted of tabling in front of the Science Center. “
Last year, we also held a candlelight vigil for students who had lost their lives due to suicide,” QSA co-chair Roland Yang ’14 said. “It was a memorial as well as a tribute to National Coming Out Day.” Yang said, together with the Office of BGLTQ, the QSA arranged for an event where students could tell their coming out stories this year, inspired by an open mic coffeehouse they hosted during Visitas.
“We haven’t had a safe space to share our stories until this year, and a large part of that is because of the BGLTQ office,” Yang said. At the event, students shared personal experiences and stories related to coming out. Most of the stories shared had an element of humor to them.
“I embraced the awkwardness that comes with coming out,” Brianna Suslovic ’16 said, eliciting laughs from those who had gathered to listen to her story. “I even came out to all the girls in my gym class while we were in the locker room.”
Yet for others, coming out had a darker tone. When Francisco D. Hernandez ’13 told his mother that he was gay, he “curled up into a fetal position” on her lap and listened as she cried.
“I asked her why she was crying and she told me that people were going to be cruel to me,” Hernandez said. “But she told me that I would always have her and could live with her until I was 80. She died just a few months later.”
Those who attended the event said that they were moved by the stories that the students shared.
“We went into Ticknor not really having a strong sense of what people were going to say,” said Philip de Sa e Silva ’13, the communications chair of the QSA. “But we were glad that people felt comfortable sharing both positive and negative experiences.”
National Coming Out Day was also marked on campus by rainbow-themed desserts in the dining halls, celebrations by BGLTQ tutors, and themed study breaks. Lowell House co-masters Dorothy Austin and Diana Eck, the first gay couple appointed co-masters of a house, hosted a “Queer Tea” in their residence. Quincy House displayed a canvas where allies could write messages of support for the queer community.
Joseph J. Vitti ’10, a freshman proctor specializing in BGLTQ life, proudly displayed a banner at the BGLTQ office which was signed by freshmen to pledge their support for their peers. Things like that, students said, made the most difference.“
A year ago, I would have wanted students to walk away with the message that they’re not alone,” Gaffney said. “But now, I’d want people to realize that they have to let people surprise them. Especially at a place like this, people will surprise you in a positive way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into college, Angela Frankel ’14 thought she might become a tissue engineer. But by the summer before her junior year—when she found herself learning how an immortal species of flatworms regenerate their bodies—she realized stem cells were her calling.
With a basic laboratory course under her belt as a sophomore, the Quincy resident discovered these flatworms—the subjects of her most intense research project yet—in the summer school lab of the National Centre of Biological Sciences north of Bangalore, India.
“There was a fast learning curve, and I had to learn how to adapt and accept things as they came,” Angela said.
Spending over 40 hours per week in lab in her 10 weeks there, Frankel watched flatworms regrow their bodies completely just days after experiencing injury. Frankel was one of the participants in Harvard’s Summer School program in Bangalore, in which students researched a wide array of neurobiology and stem cell-related topics.
That patience at the laboratory bench—a skill that Frankel’s summer mentor Pranavi Dasari noted—is a valuable quality as a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator.
“I really liked her attitude,” Dasari said. “No fuss, no complaints. Besides the extremely crucial bits, she did a lot of the work single-handedly.”
In the summer’s work—her first major independent research project during college—Frankel focused on the function of several proteins that help flatworms regenerate their bodies.
“If you cut [one of these flatworms] in two, each half will regenerate into a fully functional animal,” Frankel said.
“As a result of this unique ability to regenerate, planarians are immortal.”
Many of the flatworm regeneration proteins that Frankel studied are similar to proteins that are present in humans.
Her hope is to apply an understanding of how these proteins act in flatworms to study mechanisms of human tissue regeneration in the future.
Which means that down the line—either as a stem cell researcher or a physician—she might look more like a tissue engineer than she anticipated.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Oct. 20
An earlier version of this article stated that Angela Frankel ’14 worked 40 hours in a lab over the summer. In fact, she worked 40 hours per week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a winless string of five California road games last weekend, the Harvard men’s water polo team came out empty-handed against a strong Brown squad in its final home game of the season.
The Crimson (12-12, 4-1 CWPA) fell to the Bears (18-2, 5-0 CWPA), 23-9, Thursday night at Blodgett Pool, where the team now holds a 4-2 record this season. For seniors Max Eliot and Antone Martinho, it was a missed chance to come out on top on Senior Night.
The game was one which would decide the No. 1 seed for the Northern Division Championship, a bid which guarantees the team a spot at the CWPA Eastern Championships.
Instead, Harvard was unable to overcome a team that has been, by all measures, incredibly dominant this season.
“Brown’s a very good team, and they’re where we want to be,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “That’s something that we’ve talked about since I got here, that you want to be at the top of your division, win Northerns, get to Easterns.”
The win extended the Bears’ win streak to 10. Brown junior attacker James McNamara appeared in particularly strong form, netting a game-high six goals. Last season, McNamara held the No. 2 spot in the nation with 80 assists and was second on his team with 66 goals. On Thursday against Harvard, McNamara tallied three assists and five steals.
Bears’ sophomore attackers Nick Deaver and Henry Fox followed close behind the junior with four goals apiece. Freshman utility Will Klein led the team in assists with five.
“[The contest against Brown] was a game where we’re working hard and we’re making a lot of turnovers,” Eliot said. “So when the game gets away from you, it’s easy to get down to a level that’s not the level of water polo we want to be playing. I’m very proud of our team for not stooping to that level. We played a classy game.”
Just two minutes into the second half, which saw Harvard junior Jimmy Field take over for freshman Colin Woolway in goal, McNamara capitalized on a tired Crimson defense to drill in a 16th point for Brown just 20 seconds after the previous goal on Field. McNamara rushed across the pool, leaving Harvard defenders in the dust, and fired into the net.
Having scored only six points, Harvard would have to wait for the Bears to extend their lead to 19 before netting another goal with less than three minutes to play in the third quarter.
But things weren’t always as bleak for the Crimson.
Efforts by sophomore utility Max Murphy, freshman attacker Blake Lee and junior William Roller fired off shots against the Bears defense. The first half saw Crimson attackers throw plentiful assists and aggressive pushes at the two-meter line to net six goals.
Brown goalies Walker Shockley and Andrew Brown posted a total seven saves for their team. The Crimson was heavily outshot by the Bears.
“We just want to be quicker in transition,” Field said. “[Brown was] doing a good job on defense of making it hard for us to get the ball out quickly.”
The game saw the Crimson unable to retain possession and effectively advance the ball towards Brown’s 5-meter line.
Minnis attributed the points scored on fast breaks to turnovers.
“When you turn the ball over, you give them a chance to get out on the counter,” he said. “It’s a recipe for disaster, it’s a recipe for 23 goals. If we did a better job of protecting the ball around the perimeter, then dumped the ball of couple of times and started shooting it early on, it might have been a little different.”
Despite how Harvard played against the Bears, both Minnis and Eliot remain positive about the rest of the season.
“Losing to a team like that, it hurts to lose but we got to see the things that it takes to get to where we want to get to and hopefully in the next couple of years that’ll be us, winning another championship,” Minnis said.
“I’m very optimistic for how we’re going to play through the rest of the season here,” Eliot said. “This is kind of what we like to think of as the mid-season lull, and we’re ready to push through it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1997, Bucknell marched into Harvard Stadium and erased an early Crimson lead to hand the Harvard football team its only loss of that season.
“That one will haunt me to my grave,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “Those kids should’ve had a perfect season. They should have been 10-0, finished 9-1.”
This Saturday, on its home turf, an undefeated Harvard team (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) will attempt to prevent history from repeating itself as it takes on the Bison (1-4, 0-2 Patriot League).
With a win in its last non-conference game of the season, the Crimson—coming off of a dominant 45-13 victory over Cornell—will extend the longest winning streak in Division I to 14 games.
Bucknell has not defeated Harvard since the 1997 contest. In the 2011 matchup, Crimson quarterback Colton Chapple threw for a program record-tying five touchdowns and ran for another score against an overwhelmed Bison defense en route to the Crimson’s 42-3 victory.
This year, with the senior at the helm once again, Harvard is heavily favored to defeat Bucknell.
In the rout against Cornell, Chapple threw for 362 yards and four touchdowns, but displayed his skills on the ground as well by rushing for 53 yards and another score.
“[Chapple’s] just gone from…a freshman, [when] we weren’t sure if we should be playing him at safety on defense, to one of the most accurate, poised throwers, big-play quarterbacks that we’ve had here,” Murphy said. “It’s pretty amazing.”
Harvard tailback Treavor Scales showed off the rest of the Crimson’s double-headed running attack on Saturday, rushing for 106 yards and a touchdown of his own against the Big Red.
“One of the challenges that Harvard presents you with is the combination of the tailback and the quarterback,” Bucknell coach Joe Susan said. “That’s our challenge, to be able to stop the tailback but also stop the effectiveness of Chapple as a runner.”
But Chapple and Scales may have a tougher time against the stiff Bison defense, led by defensive end Sam Oyekoya. This year, Bucknell has held four of its five opponents to under 100 yards rushing.
“Nobody’s scored more than 20 points against us,” Susan said. “If you can come away from the Harvard game saying that, I think you’ve done a good job against one of the more explosive offenses in the country.”
While the Crimson’s offense has been dominant, averaging 47 points over the last three weeks, the Bison’s offense has been struggling, failing to put up more than 17 points in any game this season. Bucknell has dropped its last four games, although the last three losses have been within one score.
“They’re a team that’s capable of beating everybody, mostly because they’ve been in every game, right up until the very last series,” Murphy said.
Last week against Holy Cross, a team that Harvard soundly defeated just two weeks ago, the Bison couldn’t find its offensive footing, and the Crusaders took advantage, claiming a 13-6 victory.
On Bucknell’s last drive of the game, backup quarterback Trey Lauletta drove the Bison, trailing by a touchdown, down the field into Holy Cross territory, but a late interception sealed the victory for the Crusaders.
“They’re a team that clearly, on paper, isn’t a great offensive team,” Murphy said. “[But] if you play great defense, no matter who you play, you’re going to be in every game, and they have been.”
Some of Bucknell’s struggles can be attributed to a recent slew of injuries. But Brandon Wesley—the Bison’s starting quarterback who was recently sidelined due to a lower leg injury—and tailback Tyler Smith—coming off of a high ankle sprain—should both be at full strength by Saturday.
The Crimson, which has a top-ranked rushing defense that rivals Bucknell’s, looks to repeat its strong defense against the pass as well. A week ago, Harvard sacked Big Red quarterback Jeff Mathews four times, pressuring the explosive quarterback into an interception and holding him to just one passing touchdown.
While the offense has been running up the score, the defense has made sure that it is predominantly the Crimson getting onto the scoreboard—Harvard has been winning games by an average of almost 30 points.
“We practice hard, that’s one thing that we pride ourselves on,” captain Bobby Schneider said. “The coaches do a great job of getting us ready, and all that we have to do by the time Saturday rolls around is go out there fly around and have fun, and the rest of it’s been taken care of during the week.”
Despite Bucknell’s less-than-stellar record, the Crimson is approaching the last of its three-game home stand with the same focus that they would a conference game.
“[Bucknell is] definitely a tough team,” Schneider said. “We’re not taking them lightly, we’re coming in just like we would any other game.”

The Harvard men’s soccer team is at a cross-road. More than halfway through the season the team has just one victory—a 1-0 win over Michigan State more than a month ago on September 7. It finished last season with a program-low two wins.
The Crimson (1-6-3, 0-1-1 Ivy) has stressed the importance of the Ivy League after going winless in the Ancient Eight  for the first time ever in 2011. A league title seems to be out of reach, but Harvard’s chance at finishing in the top-half of the Ivies will be tested against No. 19 Brown (8-1-2, 1-0-1) in Providence on Saturday.
“We know that Brown is a good team, that they capitalize on a lot of other teams mistakes, and we respect them,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “We’re going to have to be solid and mistake free. But at the same time they’re nothing we haven’t seen already in our non-conference schedule.”
Coach Carl Junot scheduled a difficult non-conference slate, featuring some of the best teams in the country including No. 6 UConn and No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara.
“I think we’ve got the same mentality we’ve had all season: to try and win games,” Friedman said. “These teams in the Ivy League aren’t at the same level as the teams we’ve played in the non-conference schedule and we’re going to try and capitalize on that.”
The Crimson currently sits tied for sixth in the Ancient Eight with a single point—coming from a 0-0 tie against arch-rival Yale—and escaping Providence with at least a point would position Harvard well as only one of its remaining four league opponents has a winning record.
“I don’t know what kind of schedule Brown has had,” sophomore Hiroki Kobayashi said. “But I know that ours has been difficult and it has definitely prepared us well going into this weekend.”
Saturday’s game also starts a five-game road-trip that will last until senior day on November 3. The Crimson has only scored two goals in four road contests so far this season.
Harvard has traditionally dominated the Bears, with an all-time series record of 46-28-12. Last year’s 1-0 loss to Brown marked the first defeat in the series since 2007. But the Bears will be the overwhelming favorites at home, carrying a seven game undefeated streak. A Brown defense that has already shut out six opponents—the fourth best shut-out percentage in the nation—should prove challenging for a Crimson attack that has struggled to score all season.
“Brown’s always been a team that defends first,” Friedman said. “They’re always a hard-nosed team more than anything, so it’s not going to be anything we haven’t seen before. They are very organized and ready to work on the field.”
Kobayashi and freshman Oliver White share the team-lead with two goals apiece. While there are other scoring options up top, such as the team leader in shots, senior Zack Wolfenzon, none of the Harvard forwards have been able to find the finishing magic required to put fear in their opponents.
“We have to be better at our attacking game this weekend and just work well together as a team,” Kobayashi said.
Though they are known for their defense, the Bears have a balanced scoring attack that has seen 10 Brown players put the ball in the back of the net. Senior forward Thomas McNamara leads the team with three goals.
“We know they are really good at attacking soccer and keeping possession, so we have to try to shut them down and not let them play their game,” Kobayashi said.
Freshman goalkeeper Joe Festa, who appears to have beaten out classmate Evan Mendez for the starting job in goal, will have to rely on a back-line that had only allowed two goals in the previous three games before giving up three against No. 16 Cornell last Saturday.
“I think we see [Brown] as pretty comparable to Cornell,” Friedman said. “We need to just settle down and really gain some momentum by maintaining our possession of the ball. In the back we’re going to try to stay tighter than we have been in the past because we don’t want to give up any goals off of mistakes.”
Over the next month the Crimson will face conference-opponents Princeton and Dartmouth as well as local out-of-conference teams BU and Holy Cross. Junot and his team have repeatedly affirmed that a top-four finish in the Ivy League was a realistic goal for this season; on Saturday we will find out.
“We’ve only won one game so far, so the only thing in our mind is just to win,” Kobayashi said.

After losing to first-place Yale in straight sets at home the last time out, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has a chance to gain some momentum in the mid-season stretch as it takes on two Ivy foes coming off back-to-back losses last weekend.
On Friday night the Crimson (5-11, 2-3 Ivy) will travel to Ithaca to take on Cornell (5-11, 1-4 Ivy) before matching up against Columbia (7-7, 2-3 Ivy) Saturday evening.
This weekend’s matchups will be key for the Crimson as it hopes to distance itself from the Lions, which sit tied for fourth with Harvard in the Ivy standings midway through conference play. The Big Red trails both teams by one game, currently tied for sixth with Brown and Dartmouth.
“Right now we are sitting in the middle of the pack,” Harvard coach Jen Weiss said.  “The road trips to Cornell and Columbia are pretty important in the mid-season.”
The Crimson got off to a rough start out of the gates this season, going 2-8 against non-conference opponents before picking up Ivy League action in late September. Since then, Harvard has gone 3-3.
“In the beginning [of conference play], we lost a couple of close ones,” Weiss said.  “I feel like [overall] we are doing a nice job with our opponents.”
But the Crimson hopes to capitalize on its better play of late in its two critical matchups this weekend.
“I think it is going to be a good weekend for us,” said sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters.  “I think as long as we play consistently and play to the best of our ability then we will definitely be successful.”
Harvard has been hard at work this week preparing for its two matchups against teams known for their defensive prowess. According to Weiss, the Crimson has spent the past week addressing its offensive preparation and execution.
“We are focusing on our rotations and what we are doing offensively so we can continue to execute our game plan,” Weiss said.  “Serving them both deep and out of system will be very important.”
Leading the offensive charge for the Crimson will be captain Taylor Docter.  The outside hitter has recorded a team-high 173 kills thus far this season.
Closely behind has been the firepower of freshman outsider hitter Kathleen Wallace, who has boasted an average of 2.68 kills per set.
On the defensive end, the Crimson will look to maintain its strong presence at the net. Harvard ranks third in the Ivy League with a total of 197.5 blocks this season.  Freshman middle blocker Caroline Holt’s 57 blocks paces Harvard.
Up first for the Crimson on Friday night will be the Big Red, which is coming off back-to-back road losses at Penn and Princeton.
Freshman right side and outside hitter Breanna Wong has come up big for Cornell in her first season, leading the Big Red with an average of 2.89 kills per set in addition to 35 blocks.
Junior middle blocker Rachel D’Epagnier has recorded a team-high 66 blocks, averaging 1.08 per set, while junior outside hitter Sierra Young leads the team with an average of 2.69 digs per set.
On Saturday, the Crimson will take on a Columbia team that is riding a three game losing streak, having also lost to the Quakers and Tigers in their most recent road stint.
Senior middle blocker Heather Braunagel leads her team and the Ivy League with 1.32 blocks per set, while junior middle blocker Savannah Fletcher has also added an average of 1.21 blocks per set for the Lions.  Meanwhile, senior outsider hitter Megan Gaughn has totaled a team-leading 100 kills this season.
Harvard’s away games come at a critical point in the mid-season stretch.  With the Crimson so close to both competitors in the Ivy League standings, the results of these matches will have a significant effect on the rankings of the teams as they head into the second half of conference play. Harvard finished sixth in the Ancient Eight last season.
“This is going to be a great weekend,” Weiss said.
“It should be exciting, but we just have to take care of business,” Weiss added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the 2012 season, two sophomores seemed poised to play large roles after making significant contributions during their freshman campaigns. But four games in, both receiver Seitu Smith II and right tackle Will Whitman are out for the year, according to Crimson coach Tim Murphy.
“[Smith] had surgery to repair the ulnar ligament in his right thumb,” Murphy said. “For a skilled athlete, that’s a season-ending injury. The good news is that he will get a medical hardship from the Ivy League and the NCAA out of that, and to have him back for three more years is great.”
As a freshman, Smith was the team’s top kick returner, scoring a touchdown and averaging 29.9 yards on kickoff returns. Smith took on more of a receiving role as well in the early parts of this season. After 12 catches in 2011, Smith brought down 8 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown in Week Two.
“Even without Seitu, which is a significant hit—losing arguably the most explosive athlete on our team—we are very fortunate to have solid depth at the wide receiver position.”
Smith’s absence will now give another freshman a chance to step in and make an impact, just as Smith did a year ago.
“The guy that will take up some of the slack on Seitu’s role of being that third receiver...is Andrew Fischer from California,” Murphy said. “He’s not that big but he’s very physical for his size, has tremendous quickness, and he just looks very comfortable out there as a young freshman.”
With Smith out, freshman Paul Stanton has filled in as kick returner in the past two games. In his first two weeks of play, Stanton has averaged 29.3 yards on kickoff returns.
“It’s definitely going to be tough missing [Smith],” said junior wide receiver Andrew Berg. “But I have all the faith in Stanton and Andrew Fischer to go back there and make plays. So I think we’re making the right steps.”
The other starting wideouts will have to step their game up as well, but Murphy has been impressed by their performance thus far.
“Even going into the season before they proved anything, we were just really happy with our whole receiving corps…I said going in, I know no one has heard of [Berg and junior Ricky Zorn] but they are really good, and they are,” Murphy said.
While Smith’s departure means the loss of an offensive spark, Whitman’s injury means the loss of a stable force up on the offensive line.
“Will is a hard guy to replace,” Murphy said. “Anybody that started 13 straight games not only is someone who has invaluable game experience but is someone who plays at a high level with confidence.”
Whitman started all 10 games during his freshman year at right tackle and was named a preseason first-team All-Ivy player before going down with an injury.
“What we have to do to replace him is use two guys; I don’t think we can do it with just one,” Murphy said. “Junior Sebastian Parker and freshman Cole Toner—I thought those guys did a very good job last week. We still have a long way to go but we are fortunate to have two kids that we think are good players, albeit inexperienced.”

Thirsty but broke? Don't worry, Cabot Café is giving out free drinks. But there's a catch.
Every week, people who 'like' Cabot Café's Facebook page are entered into a draw and 10 winners are chosen on the weekend to get a free drink—and in case you were wondering, that means any drink. "We phased in a bunch of delicious fall drinks last week (pumpkin chai, pumpkin spice latte, spiced apple cider, etc.)," said Jesse J. Kaplan ‘13, founder and general manager of Cabot Café. "[We] want to make sure our winners have the chance to sample anything from our menu."
The deal began on Tuesday and will go on until the end of the semester. The first winners will be chosen this weekend, so you still have a chance to be eligible for the first drawing. Winners are contacted via Facebook and their names are provided to the café's baristas, who will be checking IDs.
Free drinks have been offered in the past through various contests, such as a guess-the-number-of-coffee-beans game held last spring. This is the first deal launched to expand the café’s social media presence, however, and the café managers are planning on having similar deals in the future.

October 11, 1884: Placing the Harvard Statue
Yesterday afternoon the base and finally the figure of the John Harvard statue were placed in position on the Delta. Much interest was shown by the students, who formed groups around the workmen until the bronze figure was finally lowered into place. The base is very simple, being nearly a cube in shape, but tapering slightly, so that the top is smaller than the bottom. On the front is the simple inscription cut into the stone,
John Harvard,
Founder,
1638.
On the back is the name of the donor Mr. Bridge. The bronze figure has been described before. While it was being placed in position and before it was yield an opportunity was given the men to look, and it fully met the expectations of the majority.
October 11, 1950: Inter-house Committee Asks Parietal Extension 
House Committee chairmen yesterday passed a unanimous resolution asking House masters to allow girls in students' rooms until midnight on the evenings of the Dartmouth and Yale games and until 10:30 p.m. on the Friday before the Yale game.
Present unamended rules permit women in the Houses from 1 to 7 p.m., and from 1 to 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
October 11, 1955: Eighty-Five Hour Week
Each evening at 9:45 the alarm sounds in Lamont Library and 1,125 freshmen are left with virtually no place to study. The Yard dorms are crowded; between ten and twelve they are noisy. After Lamont, freshmen can do little more than chat with friends, wait for the milk and donuts vendor, and hope for a better day tomorrow.
Freshmen have alternately hoped, begged, and demanded for some time. In 1952, 500 irate freshmen declared their study facilities inadequate and asked for an extension of Lamont hours. In answer to their request, former library director Keyes D. Metcalf stated that the cost would be prohibitive. As a result, the Union Committee financed an unsuccessful "study hall" in the basement of Memorial Church.
October 11, 1985: Who You Gonna Call?
What's something that costs 75 cents, is usually consumed at night, and can be delivered to your door within 30 minutes through a new service being started up by six freshmen?
Hint: No, it's not a slice of pizza.
Calling themselves Sperm Busters, the Thayer South residents yesterday established a "condom courier service."
With complete confidentiality, needy students can call the group's room number anytime from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. and request a condom, selecting either the regular rate (75 cents and delivered within thirty minutes) or the "God I Need It Now" rate ($1.50 and delivered within three minutes).

This Saturday marks the official start of the 2012-13 campaign for the Harvard men’s basketball team. And for the second straight year, students can be a part of the first official team practice, as Crimson Madness takes over Lavietes Pavilion at 1 pm tomorrow.
If you haven’t marked this date in your calendar yet, you should.
Don’t believe me? Here are five reasons it’s probably time to dust off those ‘Harvard Hoops’ t-shirts and head across the river.
1. Keep a tradition going.
In its second straight year, Crimson Madness may not be anywhere near the age of most things in Harvard Yard. But schools across the country host similar events each year. The tradition, known as Midnight Madness—in which teams play in front of fans at the earliest moment they are allowed by NCAA regulations—was started at Maryland in 1971.
“What we’re trying to do [with Crimson Madness] is to create a tradition,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think last year was incredibly successful, and it led into a very positive season for our ballclub.... I know our kids, our players, are very excited to have an opportunity to play in front of fans and our students.”
Who knows, if you keep this going long enough, in a few years’ time, there won’t be a student at Harvard who remembers a time before the Madness.
2. Scope out new talent.
This year’s freshman class, simply put, is one of the strongest Harvard has ever had. And what better way to get to know these new faces than by watching them take the court against each other.
“[Crimson Madness is] a neat way to be introduced or give a quick glimpse into our team and certainly our incoming freshmen—people are always interested in seeing who the newcomers are,” Amaker said. “This is a nice chance to see these kids right away in an environment that's fun, festive.”
Not to mention that with key roster changes—both expected and unexpected—players you may not have heard of yet (including some rookies) will see time for Harvard this year. Of the Crimson’s consistent starters from last season’s Ivy championship team, just junior co-captain Laurent Rivard remains on the team. It’s time to learn some new jersey numbers.
3. Get to know Siyani Chambers.
 
Speaking of youngsters, rookie point guard Siyani Chambers is someone to keep your eye on.
The departure of second-team All Ivy point guard Brandyn Curry paired with the loss of sophomore Corbin Miller—who took a leave for religious reasons—leave Amaker and the Crimson with a big hole to fill at the point.
“Our young guys are going to have chances, and there will be opportunities sometimes for others because of personnel,” Amaker said. “I think Siyani will be one of those individuals that, because of personnel, we need some of the things he brings to the table probably a lot sooner than we ordinarily would.”
As of right now, all signs point to Chambers taking over as a go-to guy in Harvard’s backcourt.
“I think Siyani’s going to be a key component to our team,” Amaker said. “There’s no question. The production we’re going to need from our backcourt, our perimeter, and especially our point guard position is going to be critical.”
If you plan on being a part of the student section at any of the Crimson’s games, Chambers is definitely a name you’ll want to know.
4. Learn some Italian…or at least see who’s improved over the summer.
It’s been a while since you’ve last seen Rivard, co-captain Christian Webster, and the rest of the bunch (no, bumping into them on the way to lecture doesn’t count). Seems like it’s time to reconnect.
Without co-captains Keith Wright and Oliver McNally, Curry, or first-team All Ivy honoree Kyle Casey, spots have opened up all over the court.
Before school started, the Crimson ventured across the pond for a foreign tour in Italy. The team came out of the trip 4-0 against its Italian opponents, and the games showcased players who will likely take on increased roles this season.
“[In Italy], I thought our sophomores took a really big step for us,” Amaker said. “It’s exciting to witness growth with guys maturing and getting better…. That will hopefully allow our program to continue to grow.”
And it’s not just the sophomore class that appears to have made key improvements.
“Laurent being a junior, Ugo [Okam] being a junior, guys like that that are becoming upperclassmen now,” Amaker said. “I'm very encouraged with the way that our program is evolving.”
5. Tommy Amaker asked you to.
Saturday’s scrimmage marks the first time this year that the Crimson will have fans in the stands at Lavietes Pavilion. And according to Amaker, this is a big deal. The coach cited home-court advantage as instrumental in his team’s recent success on the national stage.
“[Fan support] is critical for us,” Amaker said. “We’ve been very proud and incredibly honored to know that folks, in particular our student body, has helped create this home court advantage that we’ve enjoyed for a while now.”
Before then-senior guard Zach Rosen boosted Penn over the Crimson at Lavietes Pavilion in a one-point thriller on Feb. 25, Harvard boasted 27 straight victories at home. The mark was then the second-longest home winning streak in the country, with perennial powerhouse Kentucky claiming the No. 1 spot.
And according to Amaker, the establishment of a favorable atmosphere for the home team this season could begin this weekend.
“We get confidence and strength from [the fans] as a ballclub and a team that our environment is intimidating,” Amaker said. “It’s exciting and our players feed off of [fan involvement]—the start of that is Saturday. If we can get a great turnout and the energy and excitement can start, we can run with that and hopefully have that build and have our team continue to grow.”
