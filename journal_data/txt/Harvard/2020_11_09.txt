After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris — then-Senator Harris (D-Calif.) — was discussing immigration policy in a 2019 Democratic primary debate when her seamless use of female pronouns next to “President of the United States” sent a jolt through my two X chromosomes. She promised to “ensure that [the] microphone that the president of the United States holds in her hand is used in a way . . . that is about reflecting the values of our country.” It brought back memories of my six-year-old self demanding my grandmother offer me a good explanation for why no “girl” had ever been president.
In an election where there was so much at stake — racial justice, pandemic response, humane immigration policy — fixating on Harris’ gender identity may not be the first thing on anyone’s mind. But for the half of the population that has been relegated to First and Second Lady for the 230 years of this nation’s entire existence, Harris’ election is monumental. And the fact that the first woman to hold this office is Black and South Asian? All the more significant.
Harris does not stand alone as a woman who broke barriers for females in government — Congresswoman Shirley A. Chisholm, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, and Hillary R. Clinton come to mind — but Harris’s accomplishment and its timing is especially significant for me because it is only in the past few years that I’ve begun to experience what sexism is and how it operates.
When I was 16 years old, during Hillary Clinton’s run for president in 2016, I did not feel like I was treated any differently than my male peers, other than maybe the dress code. Maybe sexism was not there, or maybe I did not know to look for it. Because I was not aware of it in my own life, I did not see it in how the media treated Clinton. But now, in college — even Harvard College — I have become disillusioned. Now I see what Clinton, Harris, and all of these women had to overcome to accomplish what they did (not even including the additional challenge of systemic racism faced by Harris and Chisholm).
It’s called a glass ceiling, not a concrete roof. Sexism is often subtle, so much so that you will drive yourself crazy trying to discern if it is really there. New things happen to me in college that did not happen to me in high school: In office hours, other classmates will ask my male problem set partner what he is working on, but will not address me. I find myself gravitating towards female group mates who I feel will take my input more seriously and because it removes the stereotype threat. It is even internalized, as I will occasionally catch myself assuming that a man would be better for a given role than a woman, without knowing enough about either party. Sexism is so interwoven that it affects how women perceive the roles and abilities of other women and of themselves, and most of us may not even notice it.
These anecdotes by no means define my experience, but they are illuminating and fit into a much larger narrative. They provide context for why there are more CEOs named James than female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. For why men still outnumber women in every single state legislature except Nevada. For why no “girl” has ever been elected president or vice president of the United States — until now.
I now understand that sexism can be stealthy: lurking in societal structures, the subconscious thoughts of peers, and even in our own minds. Seeing Kamala Harris introduced as vice president-elect makes this unwelcome discovery over the past few years feel a little less daunting.
However, her election does not mean that our systems are absolved. I was actually irritated when Joe Biden pledged to select a woman as his running mate back in March. Announcing that he was only considering female candidates made it sound as if his future vice president’s only important virtue was her ability to balance a ticket. The fact that it is men who have the power to elevate women to positions that they have always deserved can create a complicated dynamic. Sometimes, the way men help women dismantle the patriarchy can feel, well, patronizing.
Women should not be at the mercy of men who select them as running mates or colleagues merely because they have decided that they now need a woman — but I’ll take this victory. Listening to Kamala Harris speak, I do not think there is any doubt that she will bring far more to the office than representation (though much needed) in the form of estrogen and melanin. She is intelligent and experienced, and will be a force to be reckoned with in the new White House — just take a look at how she conducts a Senate hearing.
There is lots of progress needed to break down the often invisible barriers women face, and lots of work for Biden and Harris to do come January 2021, but right now, let’s celebrate. My six-year-old self — and 20-year-old- self — are giddy. Today, the glass ceiling has a few more cracks in it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One-on-one peer counseling was among many campus staples lost when in-person instruction ceased this March. The days when any undergrad could head to a dorm basement to receive individual counseling from a trained peer are gone, but Harvard’s specialized peer counseling groups are trying to adapt and still offer services. After Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services suspended peer counseling sessions during the spring, multiple peer counseling groups have decided to team up to offer group therapy sessions this semester. A trio of peer counseling groups —Harvard Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, Indigo, and Response — have decided to join forces to offer more generalized virtual group counseling sessions, citing meaningful “overlap” in their counseling focuses.
First and foremost, our peers deserve credit for working to provide mental health support for undergraduates during these unprecedented times. The state of mental health was already fraught at Harvard, with survey data from recent years showing levels of depression and anxiety well above the national average. For many, these issues have been heightened by the crises of 2020 (take your pick). Being away from campus may mean students are cut off from the resources and community that’d normally help them through these challenges — making what these groups are doing all the more important.
Still, we have concerns about collapsing the distinct functions of these counseling groups into each other. It seems plausible that ECHO (a group that specializes in eating and body image concerns), Indigo (a group focused on how your race, class, citizenship status, sexuality, and any other identity affects mental health), and Response (a group centered around any and all relationship issues) have overlap in the issues they address. But normally, they do serve students with distinct concerns for a reason: specialized care. We worry that their ability to cater to those particular students may be insufficient in a more generalized group format.
We’re struck by the potential pitfalls of only offering group counseling. For instance, groups that deal with sensitive personal information like gender identity or sexual orientation will have to contend with fears and the real risk of students being “outed” in this group format. More generally, in any of these group sessions deeply personal experiences will come up. Sharing potentially unrelatable experiences to a group may be intimidating: previously, a student coming to ECHO for a one-on-one session knew that discussing say, disordered eating, wouldn’t throw their counselor for a loop given the counseling service’s focus. Now, there’s no such guarantee — your psyche and struggles are privy to whoever shows up for the general session. Alternatively, in a group session someone might share stories that prove too relatable. Unexpectedly triggering unwanted or traumatizing memories is another risk of the group-only format.
A strength of peer counseling services was their ability to offer anonymity and confidentiality to those seeking mental health care. The death of one-on-one peer counseling leaves a gap in truly anonymous and individualized campus mental health care. Knowing that confidentiality is not guaranteed can serve as a deterrent to seeking care at all, and we worry this gap may leave students without care they’re comfortable seeking. Ultimately, the fact that, this year of all years, Harvard actually has less mental health offerings than usual seems disastrous: students need all the help they can get!
Things being as they are, we encourage students to explore local mental health resources outside of Harvard’s system. We wish campus resources were strong enough that we didn’t have to, but there may be mental health care that works for you available wherever you’ve landed this semester. Since Harvard’s resources are even more limited than usual right now, if you’re able to, consider looking elsewhere. Above all, seek care however you can and wherever you’re most comfortable.
This has been a challenging time for so many. We’re sure 2020’s strain is also felt by our classmates who have taken up the noble task of peer counseling. We appreciate their work and anticipate the return of normal peer counseling after their spring suspension. However, mashing separate specialty groups together and offering only group counseling is a path strewn with pitfalls.

Researchers at Harvard, MIT, and other institutions used a new telescope to confirm the existence of the first Earth-sized planet outside our solar system in a habitable zone, a step toward understanding how life formed on Earth and could form in other solar systems.
The study, published in the Astronomical Journal on Aug. 14, used NASA’s Spitzer telescope to confirm the observations of the exoplanet, known as TOI-700 d, orbiting the star TOI-700. Researchers had also previously observed the exoplanet with NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite space telescope.
An exoplanet is any planet outside of our solar system. The exoplanet researchers identified — TOI-700 d — is considered to be within a habitable zone because its position relative to the TOI-700 star and its temperature suggest it could have liquid water on its surface.
Joseph E. Rodriguez — the study’s lead author who is affiliated with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics — said TESS’s observations of nearby stars allowed them to characterize TOI-700 d as habitable relatively easily.
“The unique and really exciting aspect about TESS is that it's looking at the closest stars to us. So they're much, much brighter, we can really do a lot more characterization by observation,” Rodriguez said. “Of all the previously known systems that were Earth-sized and in the habitable zone or close to it, this was by far the brightest one, and therefore it's the most amenable.”
Emily A. Gilbert, a graduate student at the University of Chicago who led one of three studies about the exoplanet’s solar system, said scientists believe the exoplanet has Earth-like characteristics and could have life.
“The temperature would be pretty similar, given a couple different variables, and it's small enough that we think the planet could be rocky,” Gilbert said.
Still, she conceded that its conditions are “definitely not the exact same conditions as Earth for producing life.”
“But we don't know how life got here on Earth, so we're trying to figure it out as we go along,” Gilbert added.
Another feature of TESS that enabled the discovery is the large span of the sky that it surveyed. Many of its observed exoplanets are closer to Earth than those other telescopes have observed.
“This star is at 31 parsecs, so that’s about 100 light years away,” said Jennifer G. Winters, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who helped observe the TOI-700 star for Gilbert’s study. “We consider that to be a nearby star.”
Despite TOI-700 d’s relative closeness to Earth compared to other exoplanets scientists are currently studying, Rodriguez said traveling to this exoplanet remains impossible with current technology.
“It would take us 100,000 years to travel there given the current technology,” he said. “So the actual visitation and seeing these things in real life are not in the realm of possibility.”
Although scientists confirmed the exoplanet’s approximate size and potential for liquid water, they have yet to confirm any additional features — such as composition or mass — to suggest it could contain life forms.
“Is the planet actually Earth-like? I think that’s the biggest question,” Rodriguez said.
He believes the discovery of TOI-700 d could have major implications about extraterrestrial life and the formation of life on Earth — a topic of perennial public interest.
“I think there’s something very relatable about exoplanets, or planets in general, and the general public, because we all want to know that golden question about life. Is there life elsewhere? How did life form?” Rodriguez said. “We’re just starting to chip away at this major question from a different angle.”

Scientists from the Harvard Forest and the Wuhan Botanical Garden have identified several species of maple trees as potential foundation species in Chinese and North American forests, according to a study published in the journal Ecology in late October.
Foundation species play a disproportionately large role in shaping and maintaining their ecosystems, as well as in increasing local species diversity. These include ecosystems like coral reefs, oyster beds, and redwood forests.
The study used data from 12 large forest plots in China spanning 26 degrees of latitude and ranging from cold temperate to subtropical and tropical climates.
“That's the only place in the world where you have that kind of gradient,” said Aaron M. Ellison, deputy director of the Harvard Forest and co-author of the study.
Using that data, the group successfully confirmed their hypothesis that foundation tree species are more common in mid-latitude temperate forests like those of North America than in more extreme tropical climates.
To find potential foundation tree species, the study’s authors applied two statistical criteria. The first demands that the species be an outlier in a forest’s “size-frequency distribution” — for example, by contributing more mass than expected for how common it is. The second requires that the species disproportionately affect local tree diversity.
The group found that only two maple species — the Acer barbinerve, or bearded maple, and the Acer ukurunduense, or candle-shape maple — satisfied both criteria, marking them as potential foundation species. Many more maples satisfied more relaxed versions of the second criterion.
While this study focused on how certain tree species increase the diversity of other trees around them, Xiujuan Qiao, associate professor at the Wuhan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the article’s lead author, said the logical next step would be to explore “multi-trophic interactions” involving foundation species.
“We want to know the effects of foundational species on other trophic levels, maybe ants or beetles,” Qiao said.
Though these foundation species are not endangered and are actually quite abundant, Qiao cautions against ignoring them.
“Our ecologists and natural resource managers always pay attention to rare, threatened or endangered species, but pay less attention to the foundation species,” Qiao said. “But foundation species are very important to the ecosystems, not to mention their inhabitants, and they protect associated rare species at a lower cost and with less effort.”
Ellison also emphasized the importance of directing conservation efforts towards foundation species before they do become endangered. He likened the management of foundation species to that of foundations for buildings.
“In the same way that we don't do any real management or maintenance of [building] foundations, we don't do any conservation or management of our common species. And then one day, we wake up and we find that there's a big crack in the foundation,” Ellison said. “You don’t wait until it’s disappearing before you pay attention to it.”
He further suggested that emphasizing the rarity of commonness itself might help focus conservation efforts on these common foundation species, noting that most plants and animals are actually not very common.
“There are a lot of species that are rare, there are a lot of species that are sort of in-between at medium-sized populations, but things that are really common and abundant are not themselves common,” Ellison said. “So commonness itself is a rare and unusual trait.”
“If we cast it that way, maybe we could make the argument that ‘Wow, this is something worth thinking about,’” he added.

Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences hopes to identify three to four faculty hires who specialize in ethnic studies by the end of the academic year, FAS Dean Claudine Gay said in an interview Friday.
The high-profile search, which resumed in August after a five-month hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic, includes talks from at least five candidates in November open to Harvard affiliates.
“Our processes do take time because we try to be quite deliberate, but I’m hoping that by the end of the academic year, we’ll have made progress in identifying three to four scholars,” Gay said.
Gay said searches for hires who will join the University as tenured professors tend to take longer than searches for tenure-track and non-tenure-track faculty.
“They just demand patience, but I’m optimistic,” she said. “And I’m excited about the potential of recruiting these scholars to our campus.”
In March, Gay suspended the FAS search due to the coronavirus pandemic. She announced the pause in an email to the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, a student and alumni group demanding Harvard create a formal ethnic studies program.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and other high-ranking Harvard officials subsequently declared a University-wide hiring freeze in April, which is still in place for faculty and staff.
Gay said Friday that FAS resumed the ethnic studies faculty search because it will strengthen expertise in the field at Harvard.
“The only way to ensure that we expand access to this body of knowledge is through strengthening and building and expanding our faculty capacity in this area,” Gay said. “Because this is a FAS priority, that’s why I was excited to resume the search as soon as possible.”
Harvard affiliates have pushed for a comprehensive ethnic studies program for nearly five decades; the cluster hire would not create one, but Gay has said it is a first step towards a formal program. FAS has lost several ethnic studies faculty in recent years, including Latinx studies professor Lorgia García Peña, whose tenure denial last December drew protest from students and other scholars.
In a statement last month, the Ethnic Studies Coalition said García Peña’s tenure denial is “inextricable from the cluster hire” and called on Latinx studies candidates to condition their hire on the University “reversing” that decision. The coalition’s statement acknowledged, however, that the FAS cluster hire was “bureaucratically separate” from Harvard’s tenure review process.
Gay, who has been in contact with the Ethnic Studies Coalition during the cluster hire process, declined to comment Friday on its demands.
Several prospective faculty hires are currently scheduled to speak at Harvard in November, including UC Berkeley Ethnic Studies associate professor Raúl Coronado, University of Minnesota American Studies professor Martin F. Manalansan, Stanford Sociology professor Tomás R. Jiménez, University of Southern California Religion and American Studies and Ethnicity professor Sherman Jackson, and Yale American Studies and Ethnicity, Race, and Migrations associate professor Zareena Grewal.

A panel of public health and law experts discussed how policymakers can encourage organ donations in a Friday webinar sponsored by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School.
The speakers tackled an array of institutional responses to what the center’s executive director, Carmel Shachar, opened the event by calling a “woeful” gap between the demand for organs and the number of individuals willing to supply them. Harvard Business School Advanced Leadership Initiative fellow James W. Lytle moderated the subsequent discussion between Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75, New England Donor Services CEO Alexandra K. Glazier, and the British National Health Service’s Blood and Transplant Division Project Lead Phil Walton.
Sunstein said that out of five alternatives to structuring the organ donation process, prompted choice — in which the government nudges citizens to make a choice on organ donation — is his preferred policy because it maximizes autonomy and saves lives.
“Prompted choice is best because it’s fully respectful of chooser autonomy,” Sunstein said, adding that it also contributes to a “massive increase” in the percentage of people who enroll in the organ donation registry.
Sunstein said a less preferable alternative is a “routine removal” policy, in which anyone with “no use” for their organs would be compelled to make them available to someone in need. While this policy would be the “gold star” standard for maximizing organ donations and thus saving lives, he said that it is a “violation of chooser autonomy” and would face a “public wall of disapproval.”
Sunstein laid out three other alternatives: an opt-in program in which individuals volunteer to donate organs, an opt-out program in which individuals must actively disenroll if they do not want to donate, and a “mandatory choice” program which forces individuals to choose whether or not to donate. All three policies, however, do not fully satisfy chooser autonomy nor maximize the number of organ donations, he said.
For prompted choice to be successful, it “ought to be supplemented by an assortment of nudges, such as media campaigns,” he added. Public health officials in Brazil and Belgium, for example, made a “coordinated effort” to publicize organ donation, which Sunstein said has made their prompted choice programs successful.
Walton said Britain is still in the “early phases” of understanding the success of the opt-out regime in England and Wales, which the NHS implemented in 2015. He said the country has seen an increase in consent rate for donors after brain death, but consent rates for donors after circulatory death did not experience the same increase.
Walton said the Welsh government faced difficulties implementing the novel opt-out legislation.
“We were the first country in the United Kingdom to go live with the legislation and so everyone was taking a really full eye over what it was going to do,” Walton said. “But that paved the way from an England point of view so that we didn’t have that hostile spotlight.”
Glazier said the opt-in system in the United States is rooted in gift law, rather than informed consent principles, and is built around simple prompts for donor registration during driver’s license renewals or through health apps on mobile devices.
This helps normalize organ donations and cater to the American values of individual autonomy, she said.
Glazier also highlighted the importance of cultural awareness in discussing organ donation, which Shachar also emphasized in an interview following the event.
“Culture shapes a lot of our outlook,” Shachar said. “When you approach medical decision-making, the U.S. is a very individualistic culture, but other cultures really place the individual within the context of a social network or a family.”
While the panel depicted various architectures that have been implemented to encourage organ donation, all speakers agreed that the existing policies must be reevaluated to address the growing number of patients in dire need of donations.
“It’s really worth saying out loud and remembering that, uniquely, donation is a community activity,” Glazier said. “And a successful engagement of the community is how donation happens.”

Several political analysts reflected on the 2020 election in a webinar hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics on Thursday.
The event, titled “Election 2020: What Just Happened?”, included former campaign officials Robby Mook, Karen Finney, Scott Jennings, and Maya Rupert. Moderated by IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, the conversation included analysis of the 2020 presidential election as well as comparisons to the 2016 race.
Mook, who served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager in the 2016 presidential election, said that 2020 set itself apart with its high voter turnout. He noted, however, that the polls in 2020 continued to be inconsistent with the election results in a similar manner to 2016.
“[The polls] were off for the media, they were off for the Republicans, they were off for the Democrats,” Mook said. “For me, there was a little bit of déjà vu.”
Rupert, who served as Julián Castro’s 2020 presidential campaign manager, explained that getting final results on election night this year was not only an unrealistic expectation during a pandemic but also unhealthy for democracy.
“In the last couple days, it became clear that we had to really, as a country, wrap our heads around the idea that we are past the point that election night is going to bring this moment of certainty,” Rupert said.
She added that people can “take a snapshot of the vote” at any particular time and try to announce a winner.
“The disaffection that people feel when we unnecessarily tie things to one particular night and one snapshot in time impacts the way people see voting, their role in democracy, and their future participation,” Rupert said.
The panelists emphasized that people should be prepared to allow elections to run their course, even if that means not knowing the results on Election Day.
Jennings, who served as senior adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, wrote in a follow-up email that Americans should “accept the results, no matter what they are.”
“Our democracy runs on two things: an engaged citizenry and a common acceptance of the results once the dust settles,” Jennings wrote. “We certainly got the former if you look at the voter turnout; and now we need the latter once all the votes are counted and the Electoral College does its thing.”
Gearan wrote in an email that the event was held because it was “important” to hold a conversation about the election as the country waited for the results.
“We believe it was important for the JFK Jr. Forum to host this conversation for students to gain a better understanding of this truly historic moment in our civic life and to question these practitioners about the trends and implications of this election,” Gearan wrote.
Menat N. Bahnasy ’22, IOP director of special projects, said holding these discussions right now is important given the gravity of the presidential election.
“They just gave a lot of really good insight to answer questions a lot of people have been having, especially because I think a lot of people found this election to be pretty consequential and likely one of the most important in our lifetimes,” Bahnasy said.

Researchers and clinicians from Harvard Medical School designed new telehealth rehabilitation plans for COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitalization in a recently published study.
The study, published Oct. 7 in the scientific journal of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, was a collaborative effort between physicians at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
Ginger R. Polich, lead co-author of the study and an instructor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Spaulding, said the collaboration began after clinicians in Boston and New York City noticed many patients who recovered from COVID-19 required rehabilitation for pulmonary, cognitive, and mobility issues.
“We both had a series of patients that were critically ill — hospitalized, for the most part, and requiring mechanical ventilation at the hospital,” she said. “We were developing clinical programs that could meet the needs of this population.”
The researchers analyzed results from four categories of discharged patients: those who participated in the telehealth program, those who did home physical therapy, those who did independent breathing, strength, and endurance exercises, and those who did not exercise at all. The study found that strength and endurance in patients who participated in physical therapy virtually improved as much as those who did home-based physical therapy programs.
Alfred C. Gellhorn, principal investigator of the study and a specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine, added that formal physical therapy programs performed “significantly better” than informal and unstructured exercise or no exercise at all.
“The patients who were in the groups that either didn't do any exercise, or just had a sheet of exercises that they were working off of on their own, didn't really improve in terms of their strength and endurance the same way that that the patients who did the virtual [physical therapy] program did,” Gellhorn said.
Gellhorn also said that patients did not suffer from anxiety and depression as much as expected, despite the stressful hospitalization process for COVID-19 patients.
“What my hypothesis was going into the project was that we were gonna see a lot of anxiety, depression, just because being in hospital with COVID is such a scary thing for patients,” Gellhorn said. “In the inpatient setting, most patients did exhibit a lot of mental health problems, the way that they're isolated in the hospital. They don't have family visitors, typically.”
Only about 10 percent of patients in the study experienced ongoing issues with anxiety and depression after hospitalization, Gellhorn added.
Polich said areas of future research might involve a broader subset of COVID-19 patients or compare COVID-19 patients with those recovering from other illnesses. She said that, compared to patients with other severe infections requiring mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, preliminary observations show that COVID-19 patients are doing better than expected.
“There might be a number of reasons behind that,” Polich said. “Maybe some of the people who are getting COVID might have actually fewer medical comorbidities than other people with other disorders who are requiring mechanical ventilation for the same duration of time.”
Joel Stein, chief physiatrist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, said this innovation in telehealth emerged at a fortunate time, as the pandemic limited in-person treatment and rehabilitation.
“With the use of telemedicine, the timing of that was really very opportune,” Stein said. “If this pandemic had come just a few years prior, I don't think we would have been prepared to use these tools, the way we have now.”

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, the World Data Lab, and the Brookings Institute developed a “World Hunger Clock” to project current and future levels of hunger and food insecurity.
Homi J. Kharas, the Co-Founder and Senior Economic Advisor of World Data Lab and a co-creator of the clock, said the researchers used variables including climate, wealth, education, demographics, and urbanization to train the clock.
The team had started the project to increase access to data about a pressing global issue, Kharas said.
“[There are] 2.3 billion people in the world, worrying about whether they're going to be able to get enough to eat,” Kharas said. “If you look at the metric on severe food insecurity, which literally means people going without eating, then you're looking at numbers that are closer to 760 to 800 million people.”
According to the researchers, 2020 and 2021 will see the peak levels of world hunger in recent years due to the consequences of COVID-19.
The number of people experiencing hunger will differ across global regions. South Asia is set to “turn a corner” on food insecurity due in part to increased economic growth, while in sub-Saharan Africa, levels of food insecurity will continue to rise, according to the clock.
The World Hunger Clock uses the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, an internationally-recognized survey about access to food, to measure food insecurity.
Benjamin Müller, a data scientist at the World Data Lab and a co-creator of the clock, said that the Food Insecurity Experience Scale shows “the real picture” of the individual experience with food insecurity.
The scale “accounts also for very cultural differences. So what is a meal? What is eating less in different societies? That is a highly relevant metric on that issue,” Müller added.
Müller said he hopes that world leaders and policymakers will utilise the data gathered and analysed in their project.
“The data has regional estimates for different regions within the country. So, this could be highly relevant as well for national governments” Müller said. “If, for example, the government in Kenya knows that parts in the northeast area in Kenya, have experienced much more food insecurity than around the capital Nairobi, then they can react to this information right. They can maybe target some of their resources to these parts.”
Matthew W. Cooper, a Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Public Health and a co-creator of the clock, said that he hopes their work helps readers understand the scale of global hunger.
All three authors stressed the importance of tackling food insecurity in interviews.
“It’s such a fundamental issue of development…it influences so many things in life,” Müller said.

In the age of Zoom, it is common to have your total screen time values skyrocket. I mean, sure, your phone told you that your usage went down 29 percent, but little does it know that you also had a Zoom study session all evening, and we can’t forget your endless class lectures. Here are a few ways to save your vision.
Get an Anti-Glare Filter
Your laptop is probably feeling sorry for you when you use it for the tenth hour of the day, so try purchasing an anti-glare filter to reduce the amount of light reflecting off your screen. This is especially useful if you usually work by a window or outside. A 2-pack is available on Amazon for around $20.
Keep Your Phone Away from Your Bed
Every Saturday, your first two hours are probably spent in bed, scrolling through your phone mindlessly. You delete the ten thousand emails cluttering your inbox, watch Snapchat stories of students on campus, and like Instagram pictures of a burnt crème brûlée. Why is this a habit? It’s because your phone is right next to you when you wake up. Before you go to sleep, place your phone (and other addictive devices) all the way across the room so that you’re forced to get up when you reach for it later. With this tip, you might actually eat breakfast before noon (since you will also have to get out of bed to shut off an alarm).
Delete Your Most Time-consuming Apps
Whether it’s YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, or all of the above, now is the time for a semi-digital detox. Promise yourself that you won’t give in to the urge to re-download these apps or use them from another device because no, you don’t need to binge-watch your favorite show or cyber-stalk your Zoom crush. If they’re not following you back, then they’re not following you back.
Find a New Technology-free Pastime
Each day blends in with the next, so why not break the monotony with a different hobby? Whether it’s doing cardio workouts between classes, trying out meditation as midterm season destroys your life, or making smoothies to surprise your organs with vitamins, this is a great way to distract yourself from technology for a while. Even if your fruit drink ends up making you gag, at least you saved your eyes for twenty minutes.
Call Someone on the Phone 
Can’t remember when you last simply called a friend rather than texting, FaceTime-ing, or Zoom-ing? We can’t either. But this old-fashioned way of conversing means that neither of you have to worry about how you look, nor are you jeopardizing your vision — it’s a win-win situation. If you want to go wild on historical methods of communication, write a letter to your friends (yes, with a pen and paper). Extra points if you use a messenger pigeon.
It’s a beautiful day to save eyes (“Grey’s Anatomy,” anyone?). Try these suggestions not only because your eye strain has never been worse, but also to change things up in your life. And who knows, after a whole day of classes on Zoom, you may be able to still see the facial features of your family members instead of recognizing them by their blurry outline.
