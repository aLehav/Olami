After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) down two to Columbia (12-16, 4-10) with 35 seconds to go, sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi ripped a rebound out of the air, quickly passing the ball to freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers surveyed the court and took off down towards the Columbia basket.
“[Harvard coach Tommy Amaker] said that, if they missed, he wanted me to come down and try to get something early,” Chambers said. “When Steve came down with the rebound, he gave it to me, and I saw a crease and went for it.”
Shooting past a defender, Chambers followed Amaker’s call to the letter. Absorbing contact, the freshman laid the ball up off the backboard as the referee blew a whistle. Tie game. After the ensuing Chambers free throw, Moundou-Missi picked off a pass and his fast break dunk put the Crimson up three.
Three more free throws, one by Moundou-Missi and a pair by sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith, gave Harvard a six-point advantage it would not give back in a 56-51 victory. As the timeout bell blared, the arena’s PA announcer came on with another piece of Crimson good fortune: Yale had just defeated Princeton, 71-66, for the second time this season, putting Harvard back in first place in the Ivy League standings.
LOCKED AND CHAMBERED
After finishing with only five points last Saturday in a 75-72 loss to Penn, Chambers rebounded with his most efficient game of the season on Friday. The rookie tallied 16 points on five-of-six shooting from the field and six of seven from the line, adding two steals and three assists to round out the night.
Amaker said the freshman’s play on the offensive end helped bail out a struggling Crimson squad—co-captains junior Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster combined to shoot three for 13 from the floor. On the other side of the court, Chambers was tasked with containing senior Lions guard Brian Barbour, who ended the game with 11 points.
“Siyani’s play overall was amazing,” Amaker said. “I thought he was daring and fearless in addition to having to guard one of the better guards in our league. He did a nice job of guarding him and not fouling him. Barbour is good at drawing contact and Siyani’s discipline on defense was really big for us.”
REBOUNDING ISSUES PERSIST
After giving up 13 offensive rebounds and being outrebounded by 13 overall the weekend before against Princeton, Harvard came out and was once again soundly beaten on the boards. Despite starting a much smaller lineup than Princeton, Columbia finished the game with 14  offensive rebounds, 11 of which came in the second half.
To combat this, Amaker went to a two-big lineup early in the first half and used it for a solid portion of the game. According to Amaker, playing both Smith and Moundou-Missi, who combined for 16 of the team’s 26 rebounds, was crucial to the victory.
“I think that one of the things is that we need Steve on the floor,” Amaker said. “[Smith] gives us a different presence in blocking shots but we wanted to go bigger with two traditional post guys. We didn’t always rebound the ball well with that lineup [today], but it gives us our best chance to rebound.”
Amaker said that the team’s focus on shutting down Lions guard Steve Frankowski—who scored 27 points in the two teams’ first meeting but was kept off the board on Friday—opened up rebounding lanes for the Lions.
“We certainly didn’t want to leave him and give him open looks,” Amaker said. “Sometimes when you fixate, you open up the floor for other guys and that’s what they exploited. That space left them with offensive rebounds that they grabbed.”
A FINAL STAND
On his Senior Night, Webster was the sole Crimson player honored before the game. Webster has been the most successful player in Harvard history with 89 wins and now needs only 3 points to get to 1000 for his career. Amaker said that Webster has stepped up this season in his new role as co-captain and the sole senior on the team.
“I love Christian,” Amaker said. “He’s been an amazing addition to this program. I knew he would be and we were thrilled when he decided to come to Harvard. He has had a terrific career and I can’t say enough about he kind of person he is and the crucial and clutch plays that he has made throughout his career. There is no question that he has brought a lot to Harvard and to Harvard basketball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 21 seconds on the clock on Saturday night, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers closed the door on his first Ivy League season, clinching his first conference title and NCAA tournament berth.
After being fouled by Cornell guard Nolan Cressler, Chambers went to the line to shoot two—missing the first and making the second—and ensuring the Harvard men’s basketball team a 65-56 win over the Big Red (13-18, 5-9 Ivy) at Lavietes Pavilion in its final regular season game.
Forty-five minutes later, the Crimson (19-9, 11-3) learned that rival Princeton had fallen to Brown, handing the Crimson its second consecutive outright title.
Emerging amidst uncertainty and doubt after the withdrawals of Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry at the beginning of the season, Chambers burst onto the scene with nine points in 36 minutes in the season opener against MIT. The freshman quickly solidified his spot in the lineup from the get-go, starting all 28 games and averaging 37.8 minutes per game.
But entering Ivy League play—where teams face each other twice and scouting and matchups become more critical—Chambers struggled at times to maintain his efficiency and was held to five points both times out against Penn.
“It was a compliment to him when people game-planned against him,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I told him that against Penn because their game plan was to take them out of the game.”
Chambers started the season as one of the hottest three-point shooters on the team, most notably going five for five from beyond the arc against St. Mary’s on Dec. 31, but in his last eight games, the freshman went four for 17 from deep.
But on Saturday Chambers turned it around. He put up 16 points for the second night in a row in an efficient and diverse offensive showing, going six for nine from the field and three for four from deep.
After missing his first three-point shot just over 30 seconds into the game, Chambers sunk one to open the second half and wouldn’t miss again, knocking down two more in the next eight minutes.
“I’ve never worried about his confidence,” Amaker said. “He’s going to have some tough stretches or games, but he knows how much we believe in him.”
DON’T STOP BELIEVIN’
Coming into the season with so many question marks, few would have predicted that the Crimson would finish the season in such fashion.
Princeton was picked to take the conference by a near unanimous vote in the preseason poll, finishing with 13 first-place votes points to Harvard’s two behind established big-name player Ian Hummer.
But Amaker had a different idea.
The Crimson emerged from non-conference play with a winning record, playing stretches of competitive basketball against top teams like Memphis and Connecticut. Despite a few games that were too close comfort against Ancient Eight opponents, Harvard came out on top after splitting the series with Princeton and remaining undefeated at home.
“We weren’t thought of as being a contender for this,” Amaker said. “I’m really proud of our guys for believing that we’re still Harvard. We talked about how we may not have what we had at the beginning of the year, but we have enough.”
Just one week ago, it looked like the Crimson was out of title contention. After being swept on the road by Princeton and Penn, Harvard no longer controlled its own destiny and instead had to hope that Princeton would drop one of its next three contests to force a playoff.
But this weekend Amaker said the team focused on closing out its own season regardless of what the Tigers did.
“We talked about finishing out the right way at home how we want to be remembered,” Amaker said.
RECORD TIME
As Harvard battled to hold off Cornell, a share at the title was not the only thing co-captains Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster were fighting for.
The junior and senior both closed in on records of their own in the win. With seven points, Webster—the winningest player in Harvard history—three points away from 1,000 career points. Rivard, who went four for eight from beyond the arc, tied the all–time record for three pointers in a single season with 74.
Both guards will have the opportunity to complete the season on a personal high-note provided that Webster scores three more points and Rivard hits at least one more three at the NCAA tournament.
Regardless of their personal achievements, the co-captains prioritized the team’s success above their own.
“We worked hard all week like we worked hard all season and we had to take care of our business,” Rivard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in relatively warm Myrtle Beach, S.C., the Harvard baseball team could never get the bats to heat up.
In its first two games of the weekend, the Crimson (1-6) failed to put any runs on the board, falling first to Ohio State, 11-0, and the next day, 10-0, to Coastal Carolina.
Harvard scratched across its first runs of the weekend on Sunday, but it was not enough to overcome Ball State as the Crimson went on to suffer another defeat, 10-2.
“Our main problem was executing when it really mattered,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “We hit the ball pretty fine, but we just never really put it all together at one time. A lot of people showed a lot of good things.”
BALL STATE 10, HARVARD 2
With the score 5-2 in favor of the Cardinals (6-8) after the sixth inning, the Crimson still found itself in the game. But Ball State took advantage of a series of hits to open the game up in the top of the seventh, scoring five runs with two outs left in the inning.
“It was a pretty close game up until [the seventh inning],” Kregel said. “Right there and then they were able to come together, string everything together, and execute when it mattered. And I think that’s what broke the game open.”
Harvard tied the game at one in its half of the second. After a walk and a single, freshman shortstop Mitch Klug singled up the middle to plate Kregel.
The Crimson scored its second and final run of the weekend in the fifth, when junior infielder Carlton Bailey made his way to third base after a throwing error and was singled home by Kregel a batter later.
“We’re definitely putting the ball in play, which is different than last year when we were striking out a lot more,” sophomore outfielder Mike Martin said. “We’re hitting the ball and they’re just going right to fielders, especially when we’re hitting them hard. We just need a couple breaks.”
For the third game in a row, Harvard pitchers had trouble retiring their opposition. Ball State hit junior pitcher Baron Davis the hardest, as he allowed seven earned runs in fewer than four innings.
COASTAL CAROLINA 10, HARVARD 0
The Crimson fell into an early hole against the Chanticleers (6-8) on Saturday afternoon, giving up four runs in the bottom of the first inning. Despite the cushion, Coastal Carolina continued to build its lead throughout the game, taking advantage of another four run inning to roll to a 10-0 victory.
Although the Harvard offense posted seven hits—and had a man on third base five different times—the team could not come through with runners in scoring position and was shut out for the third time this year.
“We have to be more aggressive on the basepaths,” Martin said. “We need to push the envelope a little bit more and maybe get some more hitting and running, bunting, and getting guys over when we need to.”
The majority of offensive production for the Chanticleers came from the middle of the lineup—the two-through-six hitters accounted for all 10 RBIs.
All three Crimson pitchers to take the mound struggled to contain the Coastal Carolina offense. Junior pitcher Sam Dodge gave up five runs, including three earned, before he was pulled in the fourth inning.
Martin served as the bright spot for the Crimson in the loss. The only Harvard player to total more than one hit, the center fielder contributed three singles and a stolen base.
OHIO STATE 11, HARVARD 0
In its first game of the weekend, the Crimson failed to muster the necessary offense and fell, 11-0, to the hot-hitting Buckeyes (8-4).
Harvard had no answer for Ohio State junior pitcher Jaron Long, who tossed a complete game, three-hit shutout. The Crimson was unable to work the count as Long pounded the strike-zone all day long, finishing at only 87 pitches.
Only two Harvard players managed hits on the day. Freshman designated hitter D.J. Link reached a five-game hitting streak with two singles and senior first baseman Rob Wineski also contributed a base knock.
Coming off a scoreless outing last weekend against Bucknell, senior pitcher Matt Doyle struggled on the mound, allowing six earned runs in four innings. The three Crimson relievers who followed Doyle could not stay out of trouble and each surrendered at least one run.
Ohio State received a big performance from freshman third baseman Jacob Bosiokovic, who went four-for-five with a pair of two-run homers to left field.  Bosiokovic accounted for six RBIs and scored twice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the clock struck 0 on Saturday night in Ithaca, N.Y., the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself in sole possession of second place in the Ivy League.
As a result of a 66-56 victory at Cornell (13-15, 5-9 Ivy) and Penn’s loss to Yale, the Crimson was guaranteed a conference record at least equal to the Quakers and thus assured a bid to the WNIT tournament.
Harvard (19-8, 10-3 Ivy) was led by a strong inside performance from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle who earned her second straight double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Fagbenle displayed solid offensive efficiency, finishing 7-for-10 from the field and grabbing three offensive boards.
“[Fagbenle] was really big down the stretch defensively,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “When Cornell was staging a comeback, I thought [she] turned it on and did a great job.”
That small comeback came in the last five minutes, as the Big Red tried to reduce a 13-point deficit, coming within seven.
It was too little too late, however, as the Crimson refused to lose the lead that it had held since a 6-0 start. Harvard jumped out of the gate quickly and never looked back on their way to a 31-17 halftime lead.
Fagbenle’s performance helped the Crimson exert an inside presence, as the team out-rebounded Cornell by a margin of 44-31 and shot 21-for-39 from within the arc.
“We’ve almost out-rebounded everyone we’ve played all year, so that’s an expectation that we have,” Delaney-Smith said. “When [Cornell] was staging their comeback, they went hard to the offensive boards, but we ended up making an adjustment and ended up with the edge.”
Harvard had 16 turnovers in the game, which was fewer their season average of 17.6 but more than Cornell’s eight.
“I think we still have a lot to do when it comes to teamwork,” Fagbenle said. “We know we can do better…. [We can still] improve our execution.”
Junior guard Christine Clark led all scorers with 22 points, tying her high since November, and added six rebounds as well. Many of her points came from the free throw line, where she went 10-for-11.
“[Clark] did a lot of the dirty work,” Delaney-Smith said. “She didn’t force it. She just let it come to her.”
Four of Clark’s points ended a Cornell run with two minutes remaining, as the guard scored back-to-back layups to push Harvard’s lead back up to 11.
Saturday’s game was Senior Night for the Big Red, which will lose four of the team’s top players to graduation. Seniors Taylor Flynn, Clare Fitzpatrick, Spencer Lane, and Kristina Danielak scored 39 of Cornell’s 56 points in their final game in a red uniform.
Flynn paced Cornell with a team-high 21 points. In the last minute, the senior made back-to-back threes to cut the lead down to eight with 41 seconds left.
However, the Big Red did not take another shot, and the game ended with Harvard still up by ten.
Throughout the game, Flynn shot 8-for-18 from the field, missing eight three-pointers and taking far more shots than any of Harvard’s players. As a team, the Crimson shot 44 percent against Cornell’s 30 percent, a large part of the reason for Saturday night’s victory. Harvard took six fewer shots than Cornell but drilled six more.
Both teams struggled from outside the arc, going a combined 6-for-35. Harvard has especially been struggling recently from the three-point line; all of the nine games in which the Crimson shot above 40 percent came before mid-January, and the team has shot 10.5 percent and 20 percent in its last two games.
“We haven’t shot well in a long time,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think it is just the law of averages now.”
This was Harvard’s sixth victory in a row, marking an end-of-season surge that coincides with the beginning of the postseason. Still left on the Ivy schedule is a final showdown for the Crimson with Columbia, and a battle of the Killer P’s, Penn and Princeton, both on Tuesday night.
“I think Penn is going to have their work cut out for them playing Princeton…and Columbia, though you never take anyone lightly…we just played them and I feel good [about Tuesday’s game],” Delaney-Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to earn a spot in the ECAC quarterfinals for the fourth straight season, the Harvard men’s hockey team (10-19-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) suffered a 4-1 loss to Dartmouth Saturday night at Thompson Arena.
With the win, the Big Green (15-12-5, 9-9-4 ECAC) tied the series at one, forcing a winner-take-all matchup Sunday night in the best-of-three first round series.
Having fallen to the Crimson the night before, Dartmouth had its back against the wall, not wanting to see its season—in which it had once been ranked in the top 10 nationally—end in an upset sweep to a last place Harvard squad.
“They definitely played harder,” junior goalie Raphael Girard said. “I’d say they were physically a little softer on Friday and they definitely put more traffic in front of net yesterday which allowed them to create a little havoc in front of our net and eventually score some screen goals.”
The Crimson was able to stave off the Big Green attack for half of the game, keeping the contest close, tied at one midway through the second period.
But Dartmouth scored three unanswered goals thereafter, with sophomore forward Tyler Sikura netting a power-play goal 12:48 in the second and the Big Green piling on two more goals in the third to clinch the 4-1 victory.
Assistant captain Alex Fallstrom had the lone tally for Harvard, a power-play goal 8:43 in the second from a tough angle near the left side of the Dartmouth net. Girard recorded 31 saves in the loss.
Dartmouth came out roaring in the first, dominating puck possession and outshooting the Crimson 15-5. But just one of those 15 shots hit the back of the Harvard net, with Dustin Walsh scoring halfway through the first with help from Sikura and freshman forward Tim O’Brien.
With its season on the line, and with the Crimson appearing more motivated after coming into Hanover as the underdogs and winning game one, the Big Green brought its best play to Harvard in game two and took control early.
“Going into Saturday night I don’t think we really grasped fully the intensity Dartmouth would bring out in the first period when their backs were against the wall facing elimination,” junior defenseman John Caldwell said. “So I think we got caught a little flat-footed in the first period on Saturday night.”
Fallstrom tied it up at one before Sikura scored what would be the eventual game-winner.
Senior Luke Greiner stole the puck back from the home team as they attempted to clear the Crimson attack. He immediately passed the puck back to captain Danny Biega near the right point with a backhanded pass, and then Biega sent a sharp pass through two Dartmouth defensemen to Fallstrom by the left baseline. The Swede shot the puck over Morris’ shoulder and into the top right corner of the goal.
In the third, the Big Green put the game out of reach. Senior defenseman Mike Keenan scored on a shot through traffic, beating Girard on his stick side and putting Dartmouth up 3-1. Freshman forward Brett Patterson and junior forward Lindblad were attributed with the assists.
Lindblad capped the scoring for the Big Green, taking advantage of a breakaway after senior Brendan Rempel tripped over a broken stick left on the visitors’ blue line.
Despite the four goals, Harvard believed it would be able to limit the Big Green’s attack on Sunday and make the appropriate adjustments.
“I’d say the goals we gave up [Saturday] are easily fixable [Sunday] so I think the team is pretty confident,” Girard said.
The Crimson looked to put this game behind it as it prepared for its third game in three days Sunday evening, where the Crimson’s season ultimately came to an end, as Harvard lost, 4-1.
“If you show with your own intensity it doesn’t really matter what anyone else brings to the table…. We’ll be ready from the drop of the puck until the end of the game,” Caldwell said. “We’re going to get it deep, we’re going to hit them hard, we are going to get pucks to the net, we are going to crash, we’re going to get ugly goals. We are not looking for end-to-end goals, we are looking to pound it in there, hurt them, and get some goals in the dirty areas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an undefeated dual meet season in the books, the No. 18 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) entered this weekend pursuing one last goal for the season: an Ivy League title.
“We went in with the attitude that it would be a challenge,” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “We viewed ourselves as underdogs.”
After three days of competition, the Crimson eventually fell short of its goal, losing the Ivy League Championships by a mere 68 points to Princeton.
With a 1,514 point total, the Tigers just barely edged out Harvard to claim their fifth-straight Ivy League title.
“Across the board, everyone performed to the level they were capable of performing,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We did the best we could. Obviously, we came up short of our goal. But ultimately, the score was out of our control. No one has a reason to hang their head about their performance this weekend.”
It was a close contest all weekend. The Crimson picked up a win in the first event of the meet, taking the 200 meter free relay in record-setting fashion. Griffin Schumacher, Danny Crigler, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite posted an NCAA ‘A’ cut time of 1:18.06, good-enough for a school record and a berth to the NCAA Championships.
That evening, sophomore Michael Mosca picked up his second straight Ivy title in the one-meter dive, setting a pool record with a 387.05 point total. He later went on to the three-meter event and was named Karl B. Michael High Point Diver of the Meet.
After Thursday’s competition, Harvard held a slim 467-423 lead. But Princeton came storming back in the second day of competition, opening Friday with a win in the 200 medley relay.
But the Crimson kept the points race close. Satterthwaite won the 200 free with an NCAA ‘B’ time of 1:35.00. Sophomore Chuck Katis, who has led Harvard with strong performances all year, earned his first Ivy title with a win in the 100 breast in a pool-record time of 53.90. But even with the victories, the Tigers overtook the Crimson and held a 972-949 advantage into the final day of competition.
“We expected to be down a little bit more than we were,” Roop said. “We knew if we were within 40 points of Princeton, then we had a chance of winning the meet. Everyone was pumped up about the preliminary heats that morning because that was ultimately where we were either going to win or lose the meet. We had a lot of people step up and swim really fast, but Princeton, to their credit, swam lights out.”
Satterthwaite helped lead Harvard’s charge, picking up a win in the 100 free with a time of 43.28.
“[He] was lights out every time he got on the blocks,” Wurzbacher said. “That was incredible, and we needed that from him.”
The Crimson swept the podium in the event, with Oliver Lee claiming second and Griffin Schumacher rounding out the top three. But despite the strong efforts, Harvard saw its chances of overtaking the four-time reigning champion slip as the day progressed.
“Our team swam absolutely lights out,” Wurzbacher said. “They did absolutely everything we could’ve asked them and more. Princeton was just better this weekend. That was something we were okay with because we knew we gave it everything we had.”
But in the final event of the meet, even with Princeton’s victory sealed, the Crimson had one of its most impressive swims with a record-breaking win in the 400 free relay. Satterthwaite swam the opening leg in 42.99, the first Harvard swimmer to ever break the 43-second mark in the leadoff position. Schumacher, sophomore Zach Walters, and Lee followed in a similar fashion to finish in an NCAA ‘A’ time of 2:52.32, good for both school and pool records.
“Chris went off in a time that would’ve sent him to NCAA’s automatically,” Wurzbacher said. “And then each guy stepped up in that relay in a way none of them had ever before to make sure we won. Princeton swam out of their minds in that 400 freestyle relay. Everything each of our guys did was necessary to win that race.”
In total, the Crimson picked up eight victories on the weekend while setting six school records and posting 28 NCAA ‘A’ or ‘B’ cut times.
“It really was the best meet we could’ve swam,” Roop said. “We had some really amazing performances. You just can’t help but feel really good about the direction this team is headed in, even though we didn’t end up winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team edged another step closer to the WNIT on Friday night, taking down Columbia at Levien Gym.
The 61-44 win was the fifth straight for the Crimson (19-8, 10-3 Ivy), which hasn’t dropped a game on its New York road trip since 2008 and has won seven consecutive games against the Lions.
“I thought we really took it upon ourselves to come out, not worrying about who we were playing or what was on the line, and just play our basketball,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We did a really good job of doing that.”
Lions senior forward Tyler Simpson put up 19 points but was unable to stop the Harvard squad, which outrebounded Columbia (4-22, 2-10) 46 to 31. The rebound total was the Crimson’s highest since the team brought down 50 rebounds in a win against Yale on Feb. 1. Simpson was the only player from her team to register more than eight points.
“Believe it or not, I was not unhappy with our defense,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “[Simpson is] just a worker, so she got a lot of behind the scenes jobs. I would say for the most part, until the end of the game, I was pretty happy with shutting her down well enough.”
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle nabbed her sixth double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.
“I thought she had a great weekend,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everybody keys in on her, and she wasn’t used to that coming out of the Olympics. The heat gets turned up on the double-teams and triple-teams in conference play…. We’ve had to find creative ways to get her the ball.”
Senior Victoria Lippert paced the team with 15 points. The guard totaled 53 points during a four-game homestand in which Harvard took down ivy foes Brown, Yale, Penn, and Princeton.
“She has played like a senior,” Delaney-Smith said. “She has played like a champion. She wants the ball in her hands when the game is on the line.”
The Crimson also saw offensive action from the bench, as five players combined to contribute 20 points.
“As the Ivy League season has been going along, a lot of people coming off the bench have contributed in many ways,” Curtis said. “I think having people come off the bench who are really able to play their role and contribute defensively and offensively has been key to our success.”
Harvard shooters found their stride early on in the contest. A jumper from Lippert gave the Crimson a 5-3 edge after two and a half minutes of play. From there, Harvard never released its grip on the lead.
The first half saw the Crimson hold the Lions to just 25 percent shooting from the field. Simpson shot 3-for-10 while only two of her teammates, guards Taylor Ward and Miwa Tachibana, made any field goals.
Harvard denied Columbia many second looks, with Fagbenle claiming five of her team’s 17 defensive boards through the frame.
The team finished the period on a high, with a layup from junior guard Christine Clark and a bucket from Fagbenle stretching the Crimson’s lead to 11, 30-19. Clark, who went 12-for-12 at the charity stripe at Columbia last year, was held to just five points through her 36 minutes of play.
Harvard emerged from the locker room with the same momentum with which it ended the half. Fagbenle added four points in the first minute of play and quickly grabbed a board to cement her double-double.
While the Lions improved to shoot 32 percent, it was not enough, as the Crimson extended its lead to as large as 21 with a jump shot from junior guard Jasmine Evans.
Harvard players kept the ball firmly in their own hands. The team committed just 10 turnovers through the whole contest, its second-lowest total all season behind nine at Dartmouth on Jan. 12.  To this point. turnovers had plagued the squad all season.
“Coming off of the Princeton game, [when] we only had 12 turnovers, and we used that as fuel to keep our turnovers down and really take care of the ball,” Curtis said. “We really just made a concentrated effort in practice to limit our turnovers.”
The win allowed the Crimson to keep its grip on second place in the Ancient Eight.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
This year, Pfoho relinquishes its crown as the highest ranked House in the Quad and descends to number 8 in Flyby's Rankings. But fear not, freshmen—those placed into Pfoho will have little to lament. Instead, they will celebrate spacious bedrooms, a magnificent lawn, well-equipped facilities, consistent shuttle service, and a vibrant House community.
House Spirit: Pfoho residents rally around their two-letter cry to arms, "p-f." Some might say that adding a "p" before every word that begins with an "f" is excessive; to those critics, Pfoho says "pforget you." Pfoho students love their House and will defend it pfiercely to anyone who rags on the Quad. In the days leading up to Housing Day, students and House Master Nicholas A. Christakis wear head-to-tail polar bear costumes around campus as a public demonstration of their pf-love. Pfoho is also known across campus for its Housing Day videos that are clever takes on Internet memes. Take one, the Harlem Shake. Take two, Sh*t River People Say. Take three, this controversial Hitler parody from 2010, which remains a perennial favorite on campus. No one can say that Pfoho is not culturally relevant. With its determination to put its signature "p" in front of every pfreaking pfhrase, Pforzheimer proudly takes its place among the most spirited Houses on campus.
 
Housing Quality: Bunk beds are foreign to Pfoho students. Sophomores rarely receive doubles, meaning that most polar bears are guaranteed singles for all three years. Juniors and seniors most often reside either in top floor duplexes in one of the three "bricks"— Holmes, Comstock, and Moors—or in the highly-prized Wolbach suites with hardwood floors and gargantuan common rooms. Pfoho common rooms create a desirable space for socializing, unlike those in the river Houses that are usually small and cluttered with desks. Jordan is another housing option. The Quad of the Quad, it's annexed from the rest of the House but boasts kitchens, accesable facilities, guaranteed singles, and floor-length windows. Jordan is a favorite of athletes and students who cherish its proximity to Northwest Labs and the Law School.
 
Dining Hall: No other House boasts a two-tier dining hall. Pfoho's modern architecture features floor-to-ceiling windows that stream in sunlight at all hours of the day. Needless to say, "natural lighting" is a pfashionable pfhrase around the House. While some decry Pfoho's distance from the Yard, others do not think of it as a bother. The self-proclaimed "Pfoho lunch club" travels back to the Quad every day to eat in between classes. As for food, Pfoho's chef was formerly employed by the Four Seasons, so its dining hall offers a tasty array of meals. Pfoho's dining hall is also centrally located within the House. While students in river Houses must cross courtyards to eat, Pfoho students do not have to step outside. With the exception of Jordan, Pfoho is contiguously connected by breezeways. As former House Master Woody Hastings is rumored to have remarked, any student ought to be able to travel between locations in the House "in his PJs or less."
 
 
Facilities: Anything you want, Pfoho's got it. Pfhoto lab? Check. Pfilm room where you can check out DVDs? Check. Pf-recording studio in the basement? Check. Pfoho has a recently furnished Junior Common Room with dartboards, a pool table, a widescreen TV, and a distinctly modern vibe. Pfoho is also home to the Happy Room, a faux-seaside escape complete with patio chairs, tropical lighting, and trees (painted on the walls). While some cherish the room, others question whether it is overcompensation; as one tongue-in-cheek resident commented, "Pfoho has a Happy Room because it needs it."
 
 
House Masters: Wild card. Pfoho's charming House Masters, Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis '86, will transfer from Pfoho next year not to a river House but all the way to New Haven (gross) and Yale University (for shame). With new masters at the helm of the House next year, the mood and tone of Pforzhemier is yet to be determined.
 
 
Extra: Pfoho residents need not leave their House to find a good time. Pfoho is home to the popular 90s dance, bi-weekly Stein Clubs, and occasional Saturday movie nights featuring a popcorn machine. The House also has Pfoho Fridays, where many a cool cat goes to receive sustenance from local restaurants before heading out on the town. The building manager, Super(intendent) Mario, is superb at meeting all the needs of the House. Pfoho has several practice rooms and pianos on pianos on pianos, with concerts up the wazoo. Its proximity to Porter Square opens up the eyes of freshmen to a whole array of restaurants and shops that they have not yet explored. The shuttles offer frequent and consistent service, and walking distance to the Science Center is comparable to that of river Houses like Mather, Dunster, and Lev. Quadlings take advantage of the Quad Rec and twice weekly Pfyoga in the Pfoho Pfojo. Though the future of House Life is up in the air with the departure of the Cristakises, Nicholas and Erika leave a superb team of tutors in their stead. As Pfoho once said a couple of years ago, "The Quad Can't Even Handle [Them] Right Now."

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
Lowell House is perhaps best known for its beauty. Few Houses rival the visual impact of the bell tower or the picturesque calm of the courtyard. But small, walk-through rooms and the incessant unskilled ringing of the House's infamous bells detract from Lowell's otherwise positive attributes.

House Spirit: Lowellians are a close-knit bunch who take pride in their community. Stein Clubs and Lowell Teas are popular and well-attended. Lowell is not the most aggressively spirited of Harvard Houses—but between its proximity to the Yard, beautiful grounds, and an epic Housing Day video, perhaps it doesn't need to be.
Housing Quality: Lowell housing stock is perhaps the House's greatest drawback. While the architecture may appeal to fans of the classic Harvard aesthetic, rooms tend to be small. Many sophomores get to negotiate the joys of the walk-through double, and even upperclassmen tend to have living quarters tighter than those of friends in neighboring Houses. For many Lowellians, though, the location of the House makes up in spades for the size of the rooms. Why linger in a dorm room, after all, when Noch's, Felipe's, and Tasty Burger are just seconds away? This prime location comes with its own set of cons, however: noise from nearby final clubs—and, of course, the Lowell bells—is all too familiar.
 
Dining Hall: With its pale yellow walls and grand chandeliers, the Lowell dining hall is Harvard neo-Georgian at its sunniest—inviting and elegant in equal parts. The food itself is neither exceptional nor particularly objectionable, and the servery is cramped. Lowell has the advantage of being close enough to the Yard for a quick weekday lunch, but draws smaller crowds than the perennially over-packed Adams.
 
Facilities: Lowell students can study in the "grill," which doesn't actually serve food, play squash in the House courts, get a workout in the dance studio, and even practice their climbing abilities at the Harvard Bouldering Wall. There are also many common spaces, including basement classrooms and the beautifully appointed JCR.
 
House Masters: Professor Diana L. Eck and her wife Dorothy A. Austin, a lecturer on Psychology, are universally adored and often cited as the best thing about the House. Every Thursday, Eck and Austin open up the doors of their charming, ivy-covered residence for Lowell Teas. Students pack the ground floor, baking in the kitchen and talking in clusters in the living room. Teas are a reliable source of delicious treats and friendly conversation.
 
Extra: Lowell, like every Harvard House, has its share of strange and wonderful traditions and secrets. In the winter months, dozens of Lowell residents give five-minute speeches on topics of personal importance to their peers and tutors in the dining hall. The Lowell House Opera sets up shop in the dining hall every spring, to the delight and/or annoyance of residents. The House is also known for its Russian bells, which ring out tunes like "Call Me Maybe" each Sunday, and Arts First weekend brings a "pick-up" performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture in the Lowell House Courtyard.
Our rankings so far:
7. Lowell
8. Pforzheimer
9. Mather
10. Leverett
11. Dunster
