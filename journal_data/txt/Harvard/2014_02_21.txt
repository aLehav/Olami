After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Menacing pillars of smoke tower over Tokyo. Ash, still burning, rains down as the fires grow and people flee. In one of the many episodic scenes that make up “The Wind Rises,” Hayao Miyazaki recreates the 1923 Kantō earthquake. But just after pulling back to survey the overwhelming expanse of destruction, the camera pans up to the sky. Just above the shattered city of countless hurt and terrified families, the tops of smoky clouds shimmer vibrant peach, coral, and mauve against a blue sky. Inscribed in pain and devastation, there’s a beauty—a hope of redemption. “The Wind Rises” is a movie about dreams that focuses on this duality. Each coin has two sides, and Miyazaki is eager to examine both.
 
The narrative of Miyazaki’s film unfolds in an episodic story of the fictionalized life of World War II-era aeronautical engineer Jirō Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). It opens with Jirō as a young boy dreaming of flight. Miyazaki takes the audience through a fantasy sequence in provincial Japan in which the young Jirō takes to the sky in a tiny plane from his own rooftop. The engine puffs and hiccups, and the pistons pump with an organic, bodily verve. It is a marvelous flight, but even in his fantasy, Jirō’s bad eyesight dashes his dreams, and the plane comes tumbling down. After meeting Gianni Caproni (Stanley Tucci)—a recurring character in Jirō’s dreams—Jirō decides that he will instead be an engineer. “Airplanes are beautiful dreams,” Caproni says. “Engineers turn dreams into reality.”
 
The film is rooted firmly in historical context, tracing the historical development of several fighter planes such as the Mitsubishi A5M—a direct predecessor to the infamous “Zero.” Along with Jirō’s biography, Miyazaki portrays the devastating Kantō earthquake, the effects of the Great Depression, a tuberculosis outbreak, and the political ramifications of Japan’s entrance into the war. Despite being steeped in a rich and controversial cultural-historical background, “The Wind Rises” is apolitical. Even though the baggage of designing warplanes is not forgotten, it does not hinder the beauty of the film itself.
 
The film’s narrative centers on the development of an aircraft, but it lives in quiet, personal moments of warmth. What binds the movie together is Jirō’s relationship with Naoko (Emily Blunt), a girl he meets and helps during the earthquake. Jirō will meet her again and become engaged, even after discovering that she is suffering from tuberculosis. Although the story is driven by Jirō’s race to engineer a fighter, the movie is more about what he does when he gets back home—the few moments each day he has with Naoko, or an unexpected visit or reunion. Jirō’s life is on a timer—even Caproni warns him that any creative person only has 10 years of truly great work.
Where “The Wind Rises” really excels is in its arresting visual sequences. Jirō is a humble problem-solver, but he is also a dreamer. His daytime fantasies saturate the narrative, lending the film a surreal quality. The line between dreams and reality is always distinct, but it feels as if it doesn’t matter; the film is the dream anyway. As a masterful manipulator of color and light, Miyazaki brings a certain painterly quality to all of his films. Many, including “The Wind Rises,” develop from manga series that Miyazaki created himself. He paints stunning country landscapes and euphoric, dancing action sequences. And it’s not just that the sequences are beautiful, which, frame-by-frame, they are. Miyazaki's masterful manipulation of motion is deliberate, powerful, and suffused with significance—Caproni touches the ground mid-flight, a plane skims and surges through milky clouds, Jirō runs against a crowd.
 
But the flight sequences absolutely soar. Miyazaki has had a long love affair with flight. Many of his films include extended flight sequences in which his characters take to the air, most similarly in “Porco Rosso,” which follows a World War I ex-fighter pilot. But none come close to the grace and ecstasy of flight in this film. Midway through the film, Jirō launches a simple paper airplane that whips quickly up and playfully pirouettes down. The scene is all elegance, as the paper airplane assumes nothing; it knows it must come down. But real airplanes are different—defiant. There are tangible stakes; flight is precarious. Airplanes challenge nature itself, but with the soaring successes also come devastating failure, which Jirō comes to understand as he stands over the crumpled, broken body of his own design.
 Ultimately, this is what “The Wind Rises” is about. It’s about the joy that is etched in pain. With terror comes beauty. With destruction comes creation. And with failure come dreams. What Miyazaki says with “The Wind Rises” is modest and unpretentious. We will hurt and fail, but we can do good; we can create something beautiful. It’s a reflective and fitting sentiment for Miyazaki’s last film. In this light, “The Wind Rises” is a bittersweet but ultimately joyful ride from a true master of his work. Miyazaki had the fortune of having more than “ten years in the sun,” as Caproni puts it, but still, he will be sorely missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friends, roommates, entryways, lend me your ears. I come to bewail blocking, not to praise it.
Maybe the prospect of lumping together in pods of eight pals, pleased and prepared to spend the rest of their Harvard days together, lured many a pre-frosh into matriculation. Indeed, Harvard’s housing system offers freshmen the freedom to figure out their futures for themselves. But freedom means pressure, and pressure never cooks quite as high as during late February and early March, when blocking groups form and tension foments.
Some say blocking does not matter. They say that it cannot alter or destroy friendships, that it will not determine the course and caliber of your Harvard experience, that it does not define you forever and always. They lie. Just as Caesar cast his shadow over Rome till its fall, your choices in the coming weeks will leave an indelible mark on your life and soul.
Thankfully, there’s a bright side. Though such is not the case with most things that leave an indelible mark on your life and soul, the path you take during blocking period rests entirely within your control. But what exactly is a student to do? Caesar could not chart a safe course through the stormy seas of the ancient Roman forum. How can you expect to navigate the far pricklier politics that take place at Annenberg tables and on dorm room couches? To ensure you don’t end up stabbed 23 times in the neck, chest, and groin (or more realistically, no more than seven times in the back), listen closely to a few simple tips.
First, do not let them come to you. Unless you’re some kind of überschüler, a real stud whose charisma and (perhaps more importantly) connections just radiate Adams House, you shouldn’t wait for the huddled masses to approach you in supplication. By the time you realize you sit on a throne of sand, the kids you were counting on will have secured their own fortunes. Sorry, man, their group’s full. Uh-oh, now even your current roommate has ditched you for that guy C’est Bon never cards. Et tu, Brute?
On the other hand, don’t get too pushy. You might scare them away. Act as if you bestride the narrow world like a colossus—tell your potential blockmates exactly to whom you’ve granted the pleasure of your company for the next three years—and you’ll stretch your legs so wide you'll fall in an unintentional split. There’s a far more comfortable middle ground here, but can you find it? One false step, and you might have to resort to a “who-needs-a-blockmate” post in your Harvard University class Facebook group.
It makes perfect sense to worry ceaselessly about whether you will find any living companions at all. But some may fancy themselves desirable enough to guarantee at least one name will appear alongside their own on the online housing portal. These lucky (or cocky) freshmen have the luxury of scoping out the best of their peers with whom to share a Winthrop walkthrough. It’s as a delicate a call as picking a co-consul, and history instructs you not to go at it alone.
Do you choose your best friend? Not if a falling out would leave you with nowhere to go. How about a nice, quiet girl who would never vomit in your hamper? Too boring. A boy who somehow always makes it onto the Fly party list? Such men are dangerous—he’ll sexile you before you can say “ides of March” (or two dates prior, when the Housing Gods pass their judgment and students receive news far more serious than the warnings of any soothsayer).
Perhaps you should not fear. If you fail to find a group, you know that floating, a necessary end, will come when it will come. So just give up and focus on blackmailing the Office of Student Life to place you in prime real estate. After all, remember: The evil that men do lives by the River; the good is oft interred in the Quad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every January and February, hundreds of students—freshmen, sophomores, and especially juniors—participate in the Office of Career Services’ On-Campus Interview program. Their objective is to secure employment offers from some of the nation’s most elite firms, primarily those specializing in financial services and consulting.
But landing one of these highly coveted On-Campus Interview positions is no simple matter—Harvard students are in competition not only with one another but also with applicants from universities across the country. Naturally, then, students hedge their bets—the more companies they apply to, the better their chances of landing a job.
All of those applications—if the recruiters at Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, and McKinsey like what they see—mean lots of interviews. Competitive candidates might do upwards of 20 first-round interviews. If those are successful, they will be traveling around Boston and jetting off to New York for final round interviews, after which they will finally find out if they have received an offer. All that time spent recruiting means a lot of missed class, especially during the critical period of Shopping Week.
Whether Harvard ought to be funneling its graduates into the fields of finance and management consulting is a matter of ongoing debate, as we believe it ought to be. But as long as there are firms on campus promising prestige, professional success, and impressive starting salaries, there will be Harvard students sweating in the waiting room of the On-Campus Interview facilities.
We find it deeply unfortunate that students should have to miss class to participate in a program sanctioned and administered by the university. The “interviews vs. classes” choice faced by job-seeking students runs counter to Harvard’s goals as an educational institution. We commend OCS for shifting the schedule this year so that the first set of On-Campus Interviews occurred prior to the start of the semester. But we strongly encourage the Office to go further, making it so that all first-round interviews are conducted during J-term.
With this change, students could focus on preparing for interviews and be spared the additional stress of having to shop classes and complete homework. This would likely make applicants more successful—they can spend their lunch hours finishing up “Corporate Finance for Dummies” or practicing cases instead of scrambling to finish that math problem set.
For now, we are agnostic on the question of whether organized recruiting is beneficial on Harvard’s campus. But given that it is going to happen, it may as well happen earlier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Research for the following paper was conducted in December 2013. After its rejection from several scientific journals and my mom’s refrigerator, I have submitted it to The Crimson and its audience for peer review.
Abstract:
I know that I’m pretty attractive. But it’s always nice to get some reassurance, especially from the studs at Business Insider.
The blog—renowned for articles like “The Traffic In New York City Is Totally Bananas Right Now” or their revealing exposè “Why You Should Buy a Home in a Good School District”—recently ranked Harvard men above Harvard women in attractiveness. Its results are partly based on findings from the Web site Date My School, which ranked Harvard guys second in its “Hotness Index” of Boston schools. The girls, by contrast, came in dead last.
Personally, I don’t agree with the rankings. I think the women here are more attractive than the men—probably because they have larger breasts than the men. However, these findings do support what seems like a pretty commonly held undergraduate belief that the guys are hotter than the girls. At least, that’s the opinion I’ve heard from guys. I haven’t heard much from the girls, even though I do talk to girls. Definitely.
So among some guys at least, there is a constant, whispered debate going around about the cause behind this new gender gap. And one explanation reigns over all the others: the H-bomb.
Hypothesis:
The “H-bomb” theory goes as follows: when a man “drops the H-bomb” by revealing at a party that he is a Harvard student, his attractiveness rises significantly. For Harvard women, the opposite happens.
Those who are proponents of the theory, having mastered SLS 20, are well-versed in the evidence behind why the H-bomb works. They say that women like to associate security—financial, intellectual, physical, or otherwise—with their mates, which a Harvard degree often signals. The men, by contrast, want to have a more dominant and sexual role, making the supposed smarts and sexual shyness signaled by a Harvard background a negative in female attractiveness.
In other words, women are gold diggers and men are sex-hounds. And they all can be ranked on objective scales.
The theory is something I really believe in. The evidence is there. And what other explanation could there be for the difference we see in these totally objective attractiveness measures? Still, there are doubters.
Methodology:
I’m pretty sure I’m right, though. But I had to be certain. That’s why I decided to test out the H-bomb over winter break at a California school I was visiting with some friends. I brought a tape-recorder along and recorded a few conversations with girls there. The following is what happened.
Experiment:
Trial 1:
Me: “Hey”
Her: “Hey”
2 minutes of staring straight ahead
Me: “So I go to Harvard.”
Her: “That’s cool.”
Me: “Where do you go to school?”
Her: “Here.”
Me: “That makes sense.”
Her: “Yeah. I guess it does.”
2.5 minutes of staring straight ahead
Her: “Good meeting you.”
Trial 2:
Me: “Hey, my name’s Dash.”
Her: “Oh, my name’s Kristi. This is actually my room. Who are you here with?”
Me: “Sorry. I’m just visiting some friends who go here, and they said they were invited over.”
Her: “That’s fine. No problem. Are you in school somewhere else?”
Me: “Yeah. I go to Harvard.”
Her: “Wow! Harvard! That’s so cool.”
Me: “Yeah. I guess it is.”
Her: “Must mean you are pretty loaded.”
Me: “Well, not really. But I…”
Her: “Do you wanna buy some coke?”
Me: “What?”
Her: “I’ve been trying to sell it for a while. Sounds like you could afford it.”
Me: “Heh. Nah. I’m not interested.”
Her: “I have something more hardcore. But you may not remember much from tonight.”
Me: “No it’s ok, but I would…”
She wasn’t interested.
Trial 3:
I approached a group of girls
Me: “Hey, what’s up? You know, I’m just in from Harvard and I...”
One girl: “Pretty nerdy.”
Me: “…well the school does have multiple reputations.”
Another girl: “I don’t think she meant the school.”
Me: “Oh. Ok.”
First girl: “I meant you.”
Me: “Yeah. Ok.”
Trial 4:
A girl approached me
Her: “Hey. How’s your night going?”
Me: “You know, not great so far.”
Her: “That’s too bad.”
Me: “Yeah. I’m not making a lot of friends, if you know what I mean.”
Her: “Well, sometimes things can turn around pretty quickly. All it takes is someone special…”
Me: “That’s nice. But I just kinda want to be alone right now.”
Her: “Alright. I heard that you were from Harvard. My Mom works at Merrill Lynch and she hires a lot of Harvard guys. They always seemed nice. But if you want to be left alone…”
Me: “Merrill Lynch? No. No, not at all! Please join me.”
Her: “Hmmm. Nah. I think I’m going to go. My friends are leaving anyways.”
Me: “Please stay! Or, at least, give me your number and we could meet up tomorrow…”
Her: “Actually, I really have to run.”
Me: “Does your Mom have a number?”
Trial 5:
Me: “Hey. So can you tell me more about that ‘harder stuff’ you were talking about earlier?”
Recording stops.
Discussion and Analysis:
I can’t remember too much after that. I think I may have hooked up with a couch pillow and fallen asleep.
The H-bomb exploded that night. It may have done so in my face. But it definitely exploded. It’s really a powerful tool. And I think we all can see that…that…at least I go to Harvard.
God, I'm lonely.

To the editor:
I write regarding the article, “New Lecture Policy Calls for New Forms of Student Interaction,” by Michael V. Rothberg in Monday’s Crimson. Two years ago, The Crimson was reporting on the death of the lecture and the push for more active learning. With Harvard classes now being retooled for edX and HarvardX, passive learning seems to have been elevated to new heights. I admire Professor Elisa New’s dedication to interacting with students outside of class and her efforts to bring poetry analysis to the world. But surely the world’s best and brightest students don’t compete mightily to get into Harvard only to become mere backdrops to Harvard’s world stage. The conundrum Professor New faced in simultaneously teaching a general education and HarvardX course is a reminder that we need a college-wide discussion of how to maintain our pedagogical values in the brave new world of online education.
Mary D. Lewis
Professor of History at Harvard
To the editor:
I was distressed by the casual contempt for the principles of the Enlightenment displayed in Sandra Y. L. Korn’s column “The Doctrine of Academic Freedom.” Korn’s ill-considered essay tries to establish that “When an academic community observes research promoting or justifying oppression, it should ensure that this research does not continue,” which appears to defend the firing or attempted firing of professors based on their writings, and argues that universities should stop professors from publishing discriminatory ideas.
Though Korn’s commitment to the welfare of oppressed groups is laudable, her support of university censorship is toxic to liberty and democracy. The modern concept of freedom of speech is based on the notion that unrestricted discussion of ideas, even false and bigoted ideas, will arrive at the truth. There are conceivable arguments against this notion, but Korn makes none of them; she further asks us to take on faith that her particular views of what constitutes “oppression” are worthy criteria for censorship.
The arrogance of this position aside, one wonders whether Korn recognizes the danger that a censor with differing views could pose not only to freedom and truth but also to her own political goals. William F. Buckley shared some of her notions that “academic freedom” was used as a fig leaf for the advocacy of dangerous ideas in his book “God and Man at Yale.” But for Buckley, “dangerous ideas” included atheism and the economic theory of John Maynard Keynes.
A world where freedom of speech is subject to administrative censorship and the heckler's veto is one in which neither I nor Korn would want to live. Threatening the livelihoods of professors who investigate controversial subjects is an affront to liberty.

From left pipe to right pipe, a regulation-sized hockey net is six feet wide. But on Thursday afternoon at Sochi’s Bolshoy Ice Dome, the U.S. Olympic women’s ice hockey team, which is coached by Harvard head coach Katey Stone and includes four current or former Crimson skaters, wished it were a bit wider, as a would-be game-clinching shot clanged off the left post of an empty net during the gold-medal match against Canada.
Possessing a 2-1 lead with a minute remaining, the Americans squandered the advantage and eventually fell to the Canadians in sudden-death overtime, 3-2. Though the silver medals awarded to Team USA may have been some consolation, the loss was tough to swallow for Harvard women’s ice hockey supporters.
“We were all bummed out, but you can’t forget that it’s a silver medal at the Olympics,” said Marissa A. Gedman ’14-’15, captain of the Harvard team. “I think there’s a huge thing to say about perspective, and we’re proud of them no matter what.”
 
Gedman and members of her team gathered in Adams House to watch the game Thursday, while many Department of Athletics staff members and Harvard coaches attended a viewing party in the Murr Center in Allston.
“I think the support that was shown today in Adams shows how excited we were for them,” Gedman said. “I can’t say enough about how proud we are of them, win or loss.”
 
Two of the four Harvard representatives on the squad—defender Michelle L. Picard ’15-’16 and forward Lyndsey B. Fry ’14-’15—also recorded shots on goal during their first Olympic appearance.
“Now that it’s over, I guess it’s safe to say that we can’t wait to have them back,” said Gedman of the Harvard contingent in Sochi, three of whom are taking time off from the University. “It’s been a tough year without all of them, and I can’t wait to have three of our players back and Coach Stone back on the bench…having them back is going to be awesome.”
 
The Americans held control for most of the game, taking a two-goal advantage a few minutes into the third period. But the momentum shifted later in the frame, when Canada’s Brianne Jenner slapped a shot that deflected off defender Kacey Bellamy’s right leg and past U.S. goalie Jessie Vetter to cut the deficit in half with 3:26 left.
 
Canada pulled its goalie, Shannon Szabados, to set up the 6-on-5 advantage in the final 125 seconds. Seconds after American Anne Schleper’s empty-netter attempt ricocheted off the left post, Marie Philip-Poulin, a Canadian from Boston University, flipped a shot past Vetter for the equalizer and sent the contest to overtime.
Eight minutes into the extra period with Canada on a 5-on-3 power play, Philip-Poulin stuffed the puck for the gold-medal winning goal, devastating the U.S. women, who had come a minute from breaking the Canadiens’ streak of four straight Olympic golds. Philip-Poulin also scored both goals during Canada’s 2-0 gold medal win over the U.S. in Vancouver in 2010.
Forward Julie Chu ’07 and defenseman Josephine U. Pucci ’13-’15 each notched an assist over the five games played, with the latter earning a point for assisting Carpenter in Team USA’s ninth goal against Switzerland in the second game of the group stage. Chu, a four-time Olympian, is the Crimson’s all-time leader in assists with 196 over her career in Cambridge.

A Nobel laureate and two Harvard professors commemorated the 50th anniversary of research that validated the “big bang” Thursday with a series of speeches. 
Speaking to a crowded audience about theories concerning the origin and future of the universe, the panelists reflected on the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation that garnered widespread acceptance of the theory.
Two Harvard professors, one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a 1978 Nobel laureate in physics Robert W. Wilson, contributed to the talk as scientists who had conducted vital background radiation research.
Alan H. Guth, an MIT physics professor, spoke first about prominent competing theories for the origin of the universe before the “big bang” had gained widespread acceptance.
“It may be hard to conceive that the ‘big bang’ theory was not [at one time] the only theory that everybody thought was right,” said Gouth, pointing to the now out-of-date “steady state” theory.
Wilson recounted that when he was taught “steady state” theory, he liked the theory on philosophical grounds. He added that recent progress in the field of cosmology and his own research has further interested him in the subject.
“It has been very satisfying to see how this has developed,” Wilson said.
Robert P. Kirshner, the Clowes Professor of Science at Harvard, joked that he typically sees instructors and students alike possessing an egocentric view of the universe
 
Showing a comical diagram of the universe with a stick-figure man at the center, Kirshner said that faculty and students alike think “that they are the center of things.”
Kirshner went on to say that only four percent of the universe consists of atoms, while dark energy and cold dark energy make up the remaining portion of the universe. Even though scientists can figure out proportional numbers about the composition of the universe, he noted, mysteries still remain.
The last of the talks focused on theories on the future of the universe from Avi Loeb, the chair of Harvard’s Astronomy Department.
Loeb said that while the majority of cosmology focuses on the inanimate, he wanted to “bring [humans] into the picture” by taking up the task of conceptualizing the future of the universe.
Addressing the fact that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, Loeb said that eventually the speed of expansion of distant stars and galaxies will approach the speed of light. In such circumstances, those celestial bodies would no longer be visible to the earth. According to Loeb, if extraterrestrial life were to try to contact humans, it would be impossible.
Speakers joked that as the universe changes over millions of years, they hope their work will be cited.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Penn-Princeton road weekend nearly derailed the Harvard men’s basketball team’s entire season.
In March 2013, the Crimson dropped back-to-back close contests against the Killer P’s, leaving the Tigers in the driver’s seat for the Ivy League Title. But two loaded Princeton losses in the final week of play doomed the Tigers to second place in the Ancient Eight, while Harvard escaped with the Ivy crown and an NCAA Tournament bid.
This season, the stakes are still high.
Tied for first place with dark horse Yale, the Crimson (20-4, 7-1 Ivy) will face Penn (6-15, 3-4) and Princeton (14-7, 2-5) on the road this weekend in an attempt to open up a gap at the top of the standings.
Though the Quakers were picked to finish second in the Ivy League preseason coaches poll and initially looked strong with a season-opening win over the Tigers, road losses at Brown and Yale last weekend left Penn a game below .500 in league play. Princeton has fared worse since the start of Ivy League play, quickly dropping to 0-4 before picking up its first win against Cornell.
Though Penn and Princeton currently sit in fifth and sixth place, respectively, in the conference standings, Harvard will look for two decisive wins to regain momentum after two testing weekends.
“There’s a lot of basketball to be played, so who knows where [Penn and Princeton] are going to end up being,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “This could be one of the more interesting conference races looking at all the teams that are still jockeying, so who knows how it’s going to shake out?”
While Harvard currently sits atop the Ivy League, tied with the Bulldogs, its position is anything but comfortable. After topping Brown on Feb. 7, the Crimson dropped its Saturday matchup against Yale amidst a weekend of cold shooting. Looking to redeem itself in the Empire State last weekend, Harvard forced Columbia into double overtime to pull out the victory before handily rolling over Cornell—the worst team in the league. A weekend sweep would go a long way in helping the Crimson to right the ship in a conference where every game can radically alter the standings.
“No matter who the opponent is, we want to go out and play to the best of our abilities so we can get two wins,” sophomore guard Siyani Chambers said.
The Crimson will look to top-scoring wing Wesley Saunders on both ends of the floor. The junior leads Harvard with 14.8 points per game, but his biggest contribution has often come on defense, neutralizing the opponent’s leading scorer.
Saunders will have his work cut out for him against Tigers guard TJ Bray, who leads the conference with 18.3 points per game. Last time out, Bray took the Crimson for 26 points, while sophomore forward Hans Brase added 20.
Though every Harvard player has faced Penn and Princeton at Lavietes this season, a lot can change three weeks later on the road.
“[During] the first matchup they tried to throw a few wrinkles into how they play,” Chambers said. “[There were] a few more post ups on the guards for Princeton, but any team can change what they’re going to do the second time around.”
In Harvard’s last contest with Penn, the Crimson effectively shut down the Quakers’ top shooters, holding sophomore guard  Tony Hicks o a team-high 14 points on Jan. 31. Co-captain guard Laurant Rivard notched 22 points.
Harvard’s 80-50 victory was its biggest of the season, as sophomore big man Darien Nelson-Henry could not get Penn going off the glass, notching only three rebounds. The Crimson held the Quakers to 14 percent shooting from beyond the arc.
“If you look at their personnel, they haven’t put it together as well as they’ve wanted to, but they’re just as capable,” Amaker said. “We’re always watching film and thinking how are we going to guard these guys.”
After multiple losses in non-conference play precluded the Crimson from an at-large bid to the tournament, Harvard will likely have to come out on top of the Ivy League to have a chance at the Big Dance.
The Crimson has not been victorious at Jadwin Gymnasium since the 1988-89 season, but the team has a good chance to break that streak this year. Last year, Harvard entered the season picked to finish second in the league behind the Tigers and fought with Princeton to the bitter end in New Jersey. The visitors pulled within a bucket with a minute to play before losing their eighth game of the season, 58-53.
The following night, a late-game comeback attempt fell short at the Palestra, dooming the Crimson to its only winless weekend of its conference season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My apologies, dear reader: there is simply too much to say about Ivy basketball this week to give you anything more than a pithy introduction. Harvard and Yale are tied at the top of the league, Brown, Princeton, and Columbia, are still in the mix, and the Crimson travel to the Killer P’s this weekend. I’m interested to see what the headline guy or gal comes up with for this—how about “Writer, Though Handsome, Neglects Duty”? That ought to work. Onto the games.
COLUMBIA V. BROWN
This should be a fun one. Columbia forward Alex Rosenberg is coming off of a 53-point weekend, including a career night against Harvard in which he put up 34 in a double-overtime loss. The Ivy League’s second-leading scorer, Brown guard Sean McGonagill, has slowed down a bit, going eight-for-30 in two games last weekend, but at least we know he won’t be shy. I’m hoping for some reckless threes and lots of points.
Pick: Brown
PENN V. HARVARD
I have never been to Penn’s home arena, the Palestra, and if I were to inform a veteran college basketball writer of that fact, I would inevitably get some variation of the following:
[Writer swivels head, checking suroundings; takes massive backward step to clear space; waves all limbs in a counterclockwise spiraling motion] “You haven’t been to the PALESTRA?! You HAVE to go to the Palestra! I mean, my God, it’s the PALESTRA!”
The Palestra—known as “the Cathedral of College Basketball”—occupies a special place in college basketball lore because of the uniqueness of its structure and the fact that it is nearly 90 years old and has played host to important basketball games for just about all of its history. But my expectations have been built so high by all the gushing I’ve heard over the years that they’d have to trot out James Naismith arm-in-arm with Yoda for a pregame fête to live up to the hype.
Pick: Harvard
CORNELL V. YALE
Hey, Cornell got its first Division I win last weekend! The Big Red nearly blew it by coughing up a 15-point lead in the space of five minutes, but it held on for a 70-67 win over Dartmouth. But have no fear: with dates against Yale and Brown this weekend, Cornell should quickly return to its getting-blown-out ways. The Bulldogs will cruise to set up their Sunday showdown with Columbia.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON V. DARTMOUTH
In considering what to say about such an inconsequential game, I am reminded of the efforts of our collegiate papers’ news sections, which occasionally are forced to use very generous definitions of “news” in order to fill up their pages. Take this story from The Daily Princetonian: “Princeton says no injuries due to ice, but students report falling.” Or as it could alternatively have been titled, “It is winter.” The recently elected President of our own paper, Samuel Y. Weinstock, also got his start tackling hard-hitting seasonal stories. In his Pulitzer-winning “Yard Services Recycle Leaves into Mulch,” Weinstock dove into the gripping underworld of regional leaf collection, even interviewing a worker “moments after climbing down a ladder from the roof of Wigglesworth Hall.” Sometimes, during a low moment, I will call to mind the image of an intrepid young Crimson reporter asking a sweaty dude on a roof if he can interview him for a story. (“And, sir, could I trouble you for that middle initial again?”) And then I will smile.
Pick: Princeton
CORNELL V. BROWN
For this battle of bear-affiliated universities, it’s time to bring to light one of the darkest chapters in mascot history: the story of Touchdown, the Cornell bear. Touchdown has one of the more remarkable Wikipedia pages I’ve seen in a while, and if all contained therein is indeed true, then Cornell’s early 20th century athletic directors have a lot to answer for.
Between 1915 and 1939, Cornell had four different live bears as mascots, and for some reason, everyone thought it was pretty much okay to let them loose among crowds of people. The first Touchdown escaped a photo op in Atlantic City, ran into a candy store, and then jumped off a boardwalk into the ocean. After getting rescued by two football players, Touchdown then “walked back to the hotel alone,” because godless, marauding killing machines never require supervision on their trips back to continental breakfast.
That was just the start. Cornell’s football team reportedly left the second Touchdown on the field after a loss to Penn, who took the bear in and brought him on their upcoming trip to the Rose Bowl…where he was never heard from again. That’s right, the Wikipedia page tells us, “The bear’s whereabouts after the trip are unknown.” Again, no one could be troubled to look after what would one day become a 1500-lb destroyer.
The third and fourth Touchdowns met similar fates. Touchdown III was let loose in the Cornell Club in New York City and then disappeared forever (traditional Ithacan sacrificial rite). After a big win against Ohio State, Touchdown IV was allowed to terrorize a Cleveland nightclub before being returned to the wild in the woods of Pennsylvania.
Let’s check in with the head of Cornell’s Athletic Association at the time, Romeyn Berry, for his thoughts on the ursine era. According to Berry, the original Touchdown was “hungry, mean, ill-bred, and dangerous,” and Touchdown III was a “disagreeable beast” with a “fetid odor.” Okay, then. Conclusions to be drawn here: the United States had no laws in the 1910s, and I wish Touchdown would make his long-awaited return to devour an Ithacan or two.
Pick: Brown
PENN V. DARTMOUTH
Speaking of mascots I want to stay far away from, I present to you the Penn Quaker, who goes by the name of…Quaker. Quaker is a cardigan-vested killer whose maniacal, fixed grin is the last thing his victims see before he gobbles them down through his plush jaws. The thought of seeing Quaker in person this weekend is pretty jarring. I might have to turn to the far more comforting unofficial mascot of Dartmouth, Keggy the Keg, for something to soothe my nerves.
Pick: Penn
COLUMBIA V. YALE
Yale may have found the Ivy League’s next big star in sophomore forward Justin Sears, who just captured his second straight Ivy Player of the Week honor. Sears is averaging 15.8 points to go with seven rebounds per game and has been a monster on the offensive glass, currently second in the league in that category. While Sears will be a handful down low, the Lions’ strength is on the perimeter, with Alex Rosenberg and Maodo Lo sustaining their hot shooting from deep as two of the conference’s top three three-point shooters. Columbia has the size to match up with Yale’s big bodies, and I predict the Lions will provide Harvard with a massive assist by dealing the Bulldogs their second Ivy loss.
Pick: Columbia
PRINCETON V. HARVARD
You may have heard at some point this week that Harvard has not won at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium since 1989. A lot of this is due to the fact that there was a massive gulf in quality between the two programs for many of those years—the Tigers would have dominated the Crimson in most of those games if their jerseys were 100 percent burlap. But there is also evidence that pretty strongly suggests that Princeton also benefits from an uncommonly large home court advantage.
Last March, economics concentrator John Ezekowitz ’13 conducted a study in which he compared the shooting percentages of Princeton and its opponents over the last six seasons for games played at Jadwin and those played elsewhere. Whereas the Tigers show no discernible difference between their shooting at home versus on the road, opponents collectively shot five percent worse than their season three-point average when they took the court at Jadwin.
Ezekowitz hypothesized that the strange layout of the building and the shooting backdrops it creates are to blame for the struggles of the visitors, who, unlike Princeton, are not used to aiming at such a target.
Well, congratulations to the Tigers, I guess; playing in the Thunderdome just might knock Harvard to second in the Ivy League.
Pick: Princeton

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—Different gym, same result.
For the second time in four weeks, the Harvard men’s basketball team (21-4, 8-1 Ivy) rolled over Penn (6-16, 3-5), this time by a 20-point margin at the Palestra, 83-63. After a three-point loss to the Quakers in the teams’ final meeting of 2013, the Crimson has outscored its Pennsylvania rivals by 50 points in the squads' two matchups this season. The win kept the Crimson undefeated on the road in league play.
“Certainly, I thought it was a tremendous team effort by our kids, and I thought we really played an efficient brand of basketball,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We talked about trying to bring great effort and efficiency, and when you look at the numbers and the balance, we played an efficient evening of basketball.”
The Crimson capitalized on the two strengths of the team that Amaker has preached all year: its bench and its balance. Six different Crimson players had at least nine points as Harvard moved the ball well, assisting on 17 of 26 field goals. Harvard got 23 points from its bench, which also contributed seven of the team’s 13 steals—its second-highest total of the season.
Sophomore guard Siyani Chambers led Harvard with a season-high 10 assists, running the pick-and-roll effectively all night, while senior forward Kyle Casey and junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi combined for 26 points on 9-of-16 shooting. Junior wing Wesley Saunders added 12 points, going a perfect 6-of-6 from the charity stripe.
“There is a presence and a feel about [Chambers]—he is a born leader,” Amaker said. “You can see how he can orchestrate and quarterback a team. His ability to be an outstanding ball handler relieves pressure, and he sees the floor incredibly well to find people.”
The game followed a similar script to the teams’ first meeting of 2014, an 80-50 Harvard win at Lavietes Pavilion. After trading baskets early in the contest—when sophomore Tony Hicks sunk a jumper for the Quakers, Penn trailed by just two with 9:35 left in the first period—Harvard closed the half on a 24-14 run, taking a 41-29 lead into the break with a layup by co-captain Brandyn Curry at the buzzer.
Like the contest in Cambridge, in which a big Crimson run broke the game open early in the second half, Harvard came out of the locker room and scored 12 of the first 15 second period points in Philadelphia. The lead reached 26 with 8:41 to go and never fell below 19 in the last 14 minutes of play.
“That’s why we say we always want to close the half and start the half,” Curry said. “The first four and the last four [minutes] are the most important. That sequence right there gave us a lot of momentum coming into halftime, and we had a great start to the half.”
The win was Harvard’s fifth straight in conference road play. The team won only five league games on the road all of last year, dropping three of its final five efforts—including back-to-back contests against Princeton and Penn during the season’s penultimate weekend.
“Anytime you can come on the road and have a solid performance, especially here in this arena, we are pleased with our kids,” Amaker said. “We are just focused on being the best we can be this year, and we recognize how every game is critical with the way the conference is going down the stretch.”
On the defensive end, Harvard made a living out of backcourt pressure. Curry and Chambers combined for six steals, as both guards consistently jumped into passing lanes and got out into the open court. The Crimson outscored the Quakers, 8-0, in fast break points, and turned 20 Penn turnovers into 24 points on the other end.
“I thought that was the big key to the game,” Amaker said. “We got to the foul line 35 times and shot a good percentage, but the way we were able to get out on the floor…. Our ability to grab loose balls and find things early, that was the key for the game.”
Curry said that the squad’s defensive success is contagious, with teammates inspired by their peers’ efforts on the floor.
“It starts up top with the guards,” Curry said. “When we see Siyani [or] me pick it off the floor, it gives us a lot of energy. Then [when] we see Wes and Guns [sophomore Agunwa Okolie] get us steals on the wings, it makes everybody want to defend harder. You don’t want to be that guy to mess up.”

The dastardly Frank Underwood returned to our television sets and laptop screens last Friday in the second season of acclaimed political power drama House of Cards. Round two of Underwood’s Machiavellian antics lasts 13 episodes, which also means 13 hours of valuable time.Harvard loves power, and Harvard loves winning, so Harvard should love House of Cards. Unfortunately, Harvard also loves schoolwork, extracurriculars, and being busy. To help students combine all these passions in the future—and to instruct them on how they erred in the past—we’ve come up with some multitasking methods for everyone’s Netflix-viewing pleasure.House of Hallmark CardsAny couple who did not cozy up on a dorm room couch this February 14 and close out a romantic evening with Frank Underwood’s fourth-wall-breaking croons made a grave mistake. If you want to plan a romantic date this weekend, open up a bottle of wine for two as Frank sips his bourbon. Better yet, remind your beloved how much more warmth exists in your relationship than in Frank and Claire’s with a cup of hot cocoa.Brain BreakAs midterms descend on Harvard as ubiquitously as unmanageably as the snow, students throw themselves into studying and paper-writing with aplomb. But all work and no play never did anyone any favors. A break from academia is often in order, and who better to supply it than the House of Cards cast? Try rewarding yourself for every essay page written with a few minutes of Frank’s (likely even more eloquent) tirades against his enemies. Crush an Ec 10 practice test? Watch Frank positively pulverize Senate Republicans faster than you can say “David Johnson.”Chapter 27Forget about just watching House of Cards. You can make time for the show and everything else those silly professors, teaching fellows, and bosses have been keeping you from doing: Tack an extra chapter of House of Cards onto the 26 that already exist by employing Frank’s tactics in your own life. Pesky problem set? Under a different name, con your TF into making you a grader and give yourself a check-plus-plus. Midterm on Monday? Promise your peers rewards (free uses of your Board Plus? Insomnia Cookie cake?) if they stage a coup.

The weather could not be more disgusting. From the snow that is still piled up from the last two weeks to the mist and rain that's permanently descending from the sky, finding ways to battle the slush on the ground has never been so important. But not to worry—we've come up with a list of ways to keep your feet dry while the ground is wet.1. Dig out your waterproof shoes (perhaps the most obvious solution to this issue).2. Have a nice friend with waterproof footwear carry you over the puddles—while his feet might get wet, yours will stay nice and dry.3. Leap over all of the puddles (disclaimer: puddles are everywhere, so watch where you land).4. Fly from place to place. This is pretty self-explanatory—that is, if you can figure out how to fly. Alternatively, you could buy a jetpack.5. Take a warmcut through buildings to avoid the worst of the slush. For instance go through Weld and Thayer to get from one end of the Yard to another.6. Be like Elsa in “Frozen” and make a path of ice (it won’t be slushy anymore, but it might be really slippery).7. Channel your inner Spiderman—swing from building to building.
 
And if all else fails...8. ...Just stay indoors. DON’T LEAVE YOUR BED.
