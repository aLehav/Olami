After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I spent part of my winter break on a six-day mindfulness retreat hosted by the Center for Wellness. It was spent mostly in silence, and with no friends and no phone. I found myself with ample time to reflect on my first semester and the kind of person I wanted to become during my stay in Harvardland. By night one, though, my welcome escape from the stressors of the real world was shattered. I had an eczema flareup.
I was born with moderate to severe eczema, and with the help of my mother and a rotation of lackluster dermatologists, I have managed to survive and keep it from getting to the point of infection — but that’s about it. I avoid the foods my allergist says to avoid, I always have some moisturizer with me, and I’ve never worn a piece of polyester clothing in my life. I buy dye-free detergent, try experimental treatments from time to time, and am still largely at the mercy of my immune system. Are my assignments overwhelming me? Is it a bit too humid out? My skin can tell you an astonishing amount about how the world is treating me at any given moment. At the slightest inconvenience, an itch begins deep within my bones. This itch has been compared to a bout of severe poison ivy, but that’s just not true — poison ivy does not last a lifetime, for one thing. Scratching sporadically throughout the day, and especially while sleeping, is a genuinely unavoidable, reflex-like reality for eczema sufferers.
The itch was not what made the flareup on the retreat particularly painful, nor was it the aching in the backs of my knees that followed. What pained me most was the realization that I didn’t need to spend six days in the Massachusetts wilderness, silent and sans phone, to feel isolated. The most isolating part of my existence was laid out right in front of me, in the form of bed sheets covered in my own blood and dead skin.
My skin forced me to grow up in isolation. I had to watch, alone, as other elementary schoolers took one look at me and stepped back in silent disgust, afraid I was suffering from something contagious. I listened, still alone, as adults condescendingly explained my own affliction to me, offering up rudimentary and unsolicited advice that I’d quite literally been following since infancy. This got better as I got older and grew into myself, gaining probably a little too much confidence to overcompensate for my skin. The people I’d always gone to school with got used to my eczema, and by the time I graduated high school, it had become one of the least interesting things about me (thanks for that one, Harvard).
But now I’m in a new place, without a single person I knew during the first eighteen years of my life. I meet new people every single day and rarely do they manage not to react to the redness and scaliness of my hand before shaking it. I walk through the Yard and pretend not to notice as passersby examine my forearms and neck with curious faces. I make up for it all by dressing and acting ridiculously over-the-top, doing anything to distract people from my worst and most noticeable trait. I’m so accustomed to trying to be anything other than The One With The Skin Thing that I often forget how lonely this experience is, and how emotionally exhausting it is to never quite feel like I can fully be myself even when I’m in the company of close friends and family.
I’m often told that my eczema is a minor problem, and any emotions surrounding it are invalid because, in the wise words of Kourtney Kardashian, “there’s people that are dying.” Life at Harvard has proven to me, though, that my skin is just the tip of the iceberg. As I return to a world with eczema at the forefront, I’ve come to understand that it will be like this for the rest of my life. So, I don’t want you to imagine yourself in my skin or feel bad for me because it is mine. I just want you to listen to me as I tell you what it’s like to live with this, never quite escaping the isolation that comes with it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, as a result of a lawsuit filed by medical marijuana dispensary Revolutionary Clinics, a Massachusetts judge lifted Cambridge’s two-year moratorium on the issuance of certain cannabis permits. This moratorium allowed “economic empowerment candidates” such as women, minorities, and those impacted by the war on drugs to be the sole operators of recreational marijuana shops in Cambridge.
We regret that the moratorium was not carried out to its two-year term. Lauding the Cambridge City Council’s creativity, we welcomed the moratorium as a genuine effort to both improve socioeconomic equality and remedy historical injustices in Cambridge. Sure, it wasn’t perfect. Upon its passing, we voiced concerns about the scope of economic empowerment candidate being too broad, arguing its inclusion of all women extended this grouping beyond those most impacted by the war on drugs. Nevertheless, we are deeply disappointed that the moratorium was terminated after only a few months, barely touching its two-year mandate. This early termination, without the suggestion of any concrete alternative policies to increase accessibility to the Cambridge marijuana industry for minority groups wronged by the war on drugs, seems indicative of a weak commitment to equal access and the remedying of historical injustices.
Cambridge it seems will not find out whether, given two years of implementation, great strides would have been made in righting historical wrongs and assisting those impacted by unequal policing. We simply know that no concrete attempts to accomplish this goal are being undertaken now at the municipal level, and that troubles us.
This has not stopped individuals from stepping forward and flimsily committing themselves to the goal of assisting economic empowerment candidates. Keith W. Cooper, CEO of Revolutionary Clinics, said that, despite the moratorium ending, he is not going to “take this victory and turn our backs on that program, [they’re] going to actually support it.” This sort of rhetoric, given that Cooper’s company actively challenged the moratorium in court, is not at all reassuring. Rather, it reinforced the idea that socioeconomic equality and accessibility should be apportioned by generous, largely white business owners. We don’t buy that such a system — predicated on unequal power dynamics and lacking in any sort of assurances — will really do what it claims it will.
So what should the City Council do? First, it is imperative that the City Council works quickly to develop a solution to the dearth of marijuana dispensaries in Cambridge to ensure that patients prescribed medical marijuana can easily access it in their hometown. Second, the City Council should reconsider previous proposals it has been presented with aimed at providing groups wronged by the war on drugs assistance in entering the marijuana market. Prior to the approval of the Cambridge moratorium, an alternate proposal by Councillor E. Denise Simmons — albeit one originally backed by Revolutionary Clinics — was presented that would have allowed other businesses to open dispensaries if they donated to an independent fund that would provide financial assistance to economic empowerment candidates opening marijuana dispensaries. In a market where lack of capital prevents minority business owners from entering the recreational marijuana industry, innovative proposals like Councillor Simmons’ should be thoroughly considered.
If the City is truly serious about economic empowerment and equal accessibility, we need to see alternative policies and other efforts that reflect that strong commitment carried to their full term.

I am not a minority — that is, in my thoughts, spirit, and mind. In the way my brain processes the world at most times I am part of a majority. Not because I am living in some chilling alternate universe where I think I am white. Or because I deny the clear reality that there are fewer black people in America than other racial group members. Rather because I literally grew up as part of a majority in South Africa.
Despite all the persisting problems with race since apartheid, black people in most spaces in the country feel the social privileges of being part of the majority in South Africa. I never got stares while shopping in stores. I never had the honest thought that my government had it out for black people. I never applied Western beauty standards to myself. I never feared the police. Any black South African regardless of their economic, educational, or other status can walk through the wealthiest neighborhood in Sandton, Johannesburg like it is their own, because it is their own, and they will proudly proclaim it as their own.
What this different experience of blackness leads to is a disconcerting disconnect forming between myself and black Americans. Fundamentally, there is something in the different ways that black Americans and Africans connect with each other that feels incompatible. The causes of that seem intangible. Something just feels ... off.
This is not a position I imagined I would be in. I was born to a black American mother. I carry in me the same brutal scars of a stolen heritage and slavery all the way through to the continuing burdens of the American oppression of black people. I was not raised in the absence of my American family, their influence, or our culture. Hence, I never thought black Americans would be the group with whom I would struggle to connect with the most in America. But now that I am living here, even as I am experiencing America as the rest of black America does, that is the situation in which I find myself.
I have found, though, that this feeling is not a unique experience. Among the black South African people I’ve spoken to studying in the United States, it is a near-universal reality. Black Africans are used to being the majority. As a result, we do not identify with each other as tightly as minority groups here because we’ve never had to for our safety or sanity. We engage differently with government because black people control most institutions and set them up for our benefit, not our demise. We interact differently with authorities because in reality, we have grown up in, they are not out to get us. And this rift is not even touching on the larger tensions between black Americans and Africans.
I find this disconnect bedeviling. We as the global black youth, regardless of origin, inherit a collective responsibility to continue the work that has been done by our people. The vestiges of oppression, be it colonization and apartheid or slavery and Jim Crow, manifest themselves currently in a way that affects every single black person on this planet.
We can not allow ourselves to be comforted by the progressive sounding policies or the growing comforts that come with middle-class-dom. Not until we attend to the wounds that can never be truly healed in the black psyche no matter how much political freedom or economic access we gain.
We need to decolonize the ideas around blackness and black people. By ourselves and for ourselves. We need to rewrite the histories of the world without the black parts being whited out. Never let anyone tell you that civilization started in Greece. Never let anyone say formal education as we know it was started in Europe. Never let anyone preach that the morals and values of the world stem from any Abrahamic religion.
These pieces of history are but small fractions of the larger truths about the stories of human development. The fact that I cannot regard them as common knowledge among black people is devastating. It is racism still taking its toll on all of us as a people.
Black greatness that is still suppressed or shackled away affects us all the same — regardless of what flag was loosely stapled to your melanin by some dead white man. Fighting this deeply entrenched form of racism will take a unified front on a global scale never before required of black people. This racism is much more metaphysical than any law or constitution. But it is, importantly, more universally fundamental to the meaning of being black.
This cannot be a time that we divide ourselves as black people. Not on continental borders, not on national borders, and not on class lines. Not by whether we grew up as a minority or majority. We must all be stronger than succumbing to these easy forms of division if we wish to truly experience contentment in the world we live in and will pass on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a dramatic rebuke of administrators’ longstanding position on whether Harvard should invest in fossil fuels, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly at its monthly meeting Tuesday to demand the Harvard Corporation divest the University’s endowment.
The vote marks the culmination of a four-month-long debate in faculty meetings over the proper role of the University in combating climate change. Ultimately, 179 faculty members supported a motion in favor of divestment, while just 20 voted to oppose it. Faculty supporters who spoke at the meeting argued that Harvard should be at the forefront of an international divestment movement.
English department chair Nicholas J. Watson presented the proposal, which suggested the faculty advise the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to instruct the Harvard Management Company to withdraw and no longer pursue investments in companies that “explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels.” The proposal also asks the Corporation to replace HMC investment advisers who are “unwilling or unable to comply” with the motion.
The final motion that passed included an amendment introduced by English professor James T. Engell ’73, which added that all future endowment investments should be subjected to a “system of decarbonization.” The vote on the final measure was taken by paper ballot instead of verbally — an unusual move for a Faculty vote.
Watson told faculty members before the vote that Harvard has become the “poster child” of the fossil fuel industry, and said the cumulative effect of his motion and Engell’s amendment could be “significant.”
“Divesting is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do for the long term,” Watson said.
Engell said while introducing his amendment that, even though the motion is “advisory only,” he hopes that it will provide University financial managers with “support and encouragement” to divest.
“We hope that Harvard will be a leader and not a laggard in decarbonizing its investments,” Engell said.
After the vote, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that he would bring the motion to the Harvard Corporation for consideration.
“I am confident that the Corporation will give it the thought and consideration it deserves,” Bacow said.
Bacow asked faculty members for their “patience” and added that he will inform the faculty of the Corporation’s response later this semester.
“Just as it took the faculty time and thought to get to this position, the Corporation will also take time to get to its response,” Bacow said.
A group of professors known as Harvard Faculty for Divestment has been calling for divestment for more than five years. In 2014, the group wrote an open letter to former University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation urging fossil fuel divestment. More than 500 faculty have signed onto a letter posted to the group’s website asking the same of Bacow.
Bacow has maintained that the University’s endowment should not be used as a tool to enact social change, as have several of his presidential predecessors. Instead, he has said the University must work with industry players to address climate change, among other arguments.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Economics professor Stephen A. Marglin ’59 likened the University’s refusal to divest from fossil fuels to its prior refusal to divest from companies conducting business with the apartheid government in South Africa.
“The question before us today is whether this faculty supports divestment and decarbonization now, when we can possibly influence others to follow our lead, or we wait, as we did in the case of South Africa, until nobody cares,” Marglin said. “We are voting on divestment and decarbonization, but we are also voting on the honor of this university.”
Only one professor — Government professor Dustin Tingley — spoke against the motion at Tuesday’s meeting. Tingley said that, though he studies climate issues in his research, he believes that the motion would have a “symbolic impact” that is “hard to direct, contain, and control,” rather than a direct impact.
“Today, I will vote no to divestment, but yes to investment in the research, teaching, and learning around climate change,” he said. “Yes to investment by Harvard in this vital space that has clearly struck a nerve among our students, staff, and faculty.”

Musician and actor Ben Platt will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2020 Man of the Year, the organization announced Monday.
Platt — the youngest-ever recipient of the Man of the Year award — is best known for his performance in “Dear Evan Hansen,” which won a Tony award for best musical. The cast also earned a Grammy award for best musical theater album, as well as a Daytime Emmy Award for their performance on The Today Show.
Platt’s previous credits include “Pitch Perfect” and “Pitch Perfect 2.” This year’s Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year Elizabeth Banks made her directorial film debut with “Pitch Perfect 2.”
The Hasty Pudding’s producers wrote in a press release that the organization chose Platt for the award because of his “incredible” impact on Broadway and in Hollywood.
“As our youngest Man of the Year, Ben has had a remarkable career as an actor and musician. We are also avid musical theater fans, so we are very excited for him to watch our production,” co-producer Samantha J. Meade ’21 said.
Platt is currently filming season two of “The Politician,” a Netflix series on which he also serves as an executive producer. He earned a Golden Globe nomination for best lead actor in a comedy for his season one performance.
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals annually presents its Man of the Year Award to performers who have made “lasting and impressive” contributions to the world of entertainment. Since the award was established in 1967, recipients have included Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford, Justin Timberlake, Robert Downey Jr., Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Robin Williams.
The Hasty Pudding will honor Platt at a celebratory roast on Feb. 7 in Farkas Hall, where they will present him with his Pudding Pot. Afterwards, the group will perform “Mean Ghouls,” their second production featuring a co-ed cast in more than 170 years.

This summer, the Director’s Internship program at Harvard’s Institute of Politics will offer funded summer internship opportunities at 145 host organizations, as well as a new program aimed at students interested in pursuing public service in their hometowns.
This year’s slate of internships — which include new offerings such as programs at the World Bank and the advocacy organization Time’s Up — come with at least a $5,000 stipend for participants, who must go through a competitive application process.
In 2019, the IOP offered summer jobs with 125 organizations through the Director’s Internship, up from 100 the year before.
The IOP is also debuting a new “hometown” internship, which funds independent internships in local government or with local non-profits.
“We recognize that public service and really good work is going on around the country, not just in Washington or New York,” IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said.
Samantha J. Frenkel-Popell ’21, chair of internships and career services at the IOP, called the hometown program an “amazing opportunity” for students to find a summer activity that “matters to them.”
Included in the new group of programs are a host of internships related to the 2020 election cycle, including opportunities with the Democratic and Republican National Committee Conventions.
Gearan said his public service experience as an undergraduate helped him understand the importance of facilitating such work for current students.
“When I was an undergraduate here, I received a summer stipend, and that really allowed for me to go to Washington — I was a financial aid student — and allowed me to work for my congressman,” Gearan said. “And it really exposed me to policy and politics and communications and really shaped some of my career direction.”
“So I come to this with a personal appreciation for it,” he added.
In addition to the Director’s Internship Program, the IOP offers other summer opportunities such as the Summer Stipend Program, which funds independent public service internships, and the Summer in Washington Program, which organizes public-service focused events in Washington D.C. for Harvard undergraduates.
Gearan also pointed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s call for Harvard graduates to pursue public service in his inauguration address as motivation for expanding such opportunities for students.
He said he hopes students share the lessons they learn during the Director’s Internship program with peers when they return to campus in the fall.
“Other students who might have not had that summer experience can also be informed and perhaps even inspired by the work when they hear about one of our interns working in the mayor’s office or for a non-profit,” Gearan said.

Harvard Graduate School of Design hosted an event discussing Harvard’s expansion into Allston from an urban-planning perspective Tuesday.
The event, which took place in the Gund Hall, featured presentations by Alex Kreiger, an urban design professor, and Marika E. Reuling, the managing director for Allston initiatives at Harvard.
A panel of stakeholders — including Harvard Allston Land Company CEO Thomas P. Glynn III, urban designer Martin S. Zogran, Boston cultural planning director Courtney D. Sharpe, and real estate firm managing director Rustom A. Cowasjee — also discussed Harvard’s vision for Allston.
The event took place as the University prepares to open its newest additions to the Allston campus in 2020. The ongoing relocation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to North Allston has brought extensive physical development to the neighborhood, which has been met with concerns from students and residents alike.
Harvard has released some of its plans for future development in Allston, including details about the Enterprise Research Campus, for which Cowasjee’s firm — Tishman Speyer — was recently announced as the “preferred developer.”
Design School Dean Sarah M. Whiting provided a brief introduction to the event, and Krieger presented on the history of Harvard and Allston.
He described the planning that went into designing Harvard’s next steps and discussed the University’s efforts to get to know the neighborhood, as well as the potential consequences of climate change on the development.
Reuling then presented the overall timeline for Allston development and discussed the University’s larger goals in expanding the campus.
“We have increased opportunity to think about how our teaching and research ecosystem here in the Greater Boston area can really create innovative change and the ways in which our physical planning and placemaking can create those opportunities as well,” she said.
Glynn said the University is looking to create an active development with strong ties to the neighborhood.
“What we’re trying to accomplish is a place that isn’t a 9 to 5 suburban office park that happens to be based on Western Avenue,” he said. “We really want to capture something that is active seven days a week and active 14, 16 hours a day.”
Others discussed the University’s attempts to make the development welcoming to community members and responsive to issues of affordable housing.
“They’re just trying to make it like a really great space that isn’t just strictly for Harvard use, but for the community in general,” Megan M. Mandosa, an attendee said.
Some attendees said they were excited about what Harvard’s next steps mean for the area.
“It’s a huge opportunity to redefine that part of the city,” Alykahn Mohamed, an urban planner at Sasaki who attended the event, said.

Apthorp House, which has served as Adams House’s faculty dean residence since 1931, anticipates at least a six month delay in the reopening of the building.
Apthorp’s restoration was originally slated to begin in summer 2020, with the building’s reopening slated for August 2021. According to Adams House Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, the opening has now been rescheduled to early 2022 because of the significant changes planned for the 260-year-old building.
Palfrey said Apthorp House’s heating system will undergo some much-needed changes. He also explained that the added renovation time will ensure that issues like “minor cracks in the foundation” of the building can be properly addressed.
“During the 21 years we were in Apthorp, the ceiling fell in four or five times because the steam and the moisture gets into the walls and ceilings and destroys the plaster and then the ceiling falls in,” Palfrey said. “Now we’re renovating it in a way that won’t allow the building to fall apart for at least the next 100 years.”
The refurbishment of Adams House is the latest development in the over $1 billion House Renewal Initiative. The Adams House renewal project is projected to occur in three phases spanning across four years, with completion scheduled for fall 2023.
Merle A. Bicknell, the assistant dean for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s Office of Physical Resources and Planning, wrote in an email that the plans for the Apthorp renewal were “considered in full light” of its age and history. The last time the building was renovated was in 1930.
The renovated building will retain all of the original wooden structures within the building, though some heavy beams will be reinforced with steel to prevent changes in the wood that could “jeopardize the health of the structure” over time, according to Bicknell. She added that these strategies for renewals are meant to comply with Cambridge Historical Commission guidelines.
“The work planned for Apthorp is intended to steward it well into the twenty-first century, while remaining sympathetic to the original design and historic building technologies employed in its construction,” she wrote.
Historical Commission Executive Director Charles M. Sullivan said in an interview that the Commission was heavily involved in the planning of Apthorp’s renewal, given that the building falls within the Harvard Square Conservation District. He agreed with Bicknell’s assessment that the interior will “substantially” retain its original structures. He did acknowledge that, due to the age of the building, unforeseen issues may arise, and said members of the commission will be present to supervise the initial construction work.
“For a renovation project for a structure that old, there's often pretty clear possibility that there could be that kind of replacement necessary,” he said.
Bicknell wrote that the renewal planning takes the unexpected into account when dealing with Apthorp House.
“House Renewal work is always surgical, but at Apthorp it will be even more so, and due to the home’s age and evolution, we expect to learn new things about the house as various layers are revealed during construction,” she wrote.

Harvard and the plaintiff in a 2018 wrongful death lawsuit filed dueling motions over whether a set of University documents and other materials will be subject to discovery on Jan. 27.
The suit alleges that the University and some of its employees were negligent in their care of a Harvard undergraduate, Luke Z. Tang ’18, who died by suicide in September 2015. Wendell W. Tang — Luke’s father — filed the suit on behalf of his son in September 2018.
Harvard’s proposed protective order would designate certain “sensitive” discovery materials in the litigation to safeguard them from being used for “any ulterior or unauthorized purpose.” The materials at issue include student and personnel records, as well as “non-public materials about the approaches Harvard takes to prevent student suicides” and “internal, non-public policies and procedures relating to safety, security, and residential life,” according to Harvard’s motion.
“The proposed protective order contains the most fundamental safeguard in any litigation for all discovery produced—that discovery may be used for only for the purpose of the litigation and not for any ulterior or unauthorized purpose,” Harvard’s lawyers wrote.
In response, Wendell Tang’s lawyers argued that the University is attempting to “preemptively” keep discovery materials confidential and impose an unfair burden of proof on the plaintiff.
Wendell Tang’s motion further alleges that Harvard’s proposed sealing of documents would violate Massachusetts law, which they argue supports the disclosure of information which may be in the public interest.
“Harvard wants to limit public access, including to parents of students whom they are sending away from home for the first time, to information concerning mental health issues confronted by college students, the availability of mental health services and occurrences of student suicide,” his lawyers wrote.
“No defendant should be allowed to shield itself from future liability of future change by hiding its knowledge of risk behind unilateral confidentiality agreements and by blocking disclosure of information acquired during a lawsuit to that lawsuit,” Tang’s motion added. “Sunshine is an effective disinfectant.”
Asked for comment, University spokesperson Rachael Dane referred to Harvard’s reply in the case, which argued that Tang’s estate conflated documents filed in court with discovery materials produced by parties in litigation.
In addition to suing the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — Tang brought suit against residential dean Catherine R. Shapiro, Lowell House Resident Dean Caitlin Casey, Harvard University Health Services mental health counselor Melanie G. Northrop, and HUHS psychiatrist David W. Abramson, for “negligence and carelessness” resulting in Tang’s death.

Harvard’s Office for Undergraduate Education has completed a transition to a new version of its course and instructor evaluation platform, known as the Q Guide.
Harvard began the transition to a new evaluation system by undertaking a “discovery phase” during the 2016-2017 academic year, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane. During this phase, Harvard decided to move to a vendor solution rather than continue with the “home-grown” system it developed for itself in 2004 and 2005.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences selected the vendor Explorance for the new evaluation system. FAS ran a pilot of 17 courses on the new site in the spring of 2019 and transitioned all courses over to the new evaluation platform in the fall of 2019.
The University’s Office of Institutional Research, which administers course evaluations for FAS, provided the business requirements for the new site, while Harvard University Information Technology handled the technical aspects of developing the site.
All questions that are currently available on the Q Guide will also be available on the new site, for the time being.
In the fall of 2019, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh wrote in an email to College affiliates that her office would be reviewing the questions asked on the Q Guide.
“We’re eager to hear what you think about these issues,” she wrote in her message.
The new site will not feature information on course affordability, which was removed from the Q Guide after the fall of 2017.
The Committee on Undergraduate Education introduced two new Q Guide questions on the amount of money students spent on course materials in the spring of 2017. The changes came after students criticized Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw for requiring the purchase of a $132 textbook with a required online access code. The Undergraduate Council subsequently lobbied for transparent information on affordability.
Meanwhile, in October 2019, Harvard Law School student government representatives began working with administrators to change Law School course evaluations to mirror the system employed in FAS’s Q Guide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard presented its infrastructure projects, sustainability initiatives, and neighborhood engagement initiatives to the Cambridge Planning Board at the annual Town Gown report meeting Tuesday.
The Town Gown meeting is an opportunity for the planning board to conduct an "annual joint review of university and community needs and plans,” according to the Cambridge municipal website. Each year, universities in Cambridge, including Harvard, are required to submit a report to the Community Development Department outlining their recent projects and future plans. These institutions typically present their Town Gown reports to the Planning Board in early February.
The term “town gown” describes the relationship and coexistence of the non-academic — “town” — and academic — “gown” — populations in cities with university campuses.
On Tuesday evening, Harvard presented its report along with MIT and Lesley University.
Harvard’s director of planning services, Alexandra J. Offiong, gave an overview at the meeting of the University’s recent infrastructure projects, including the completed renovations of Lowell House, Robinson Hall, Schlesinger Library, and Gutman Library.
She also updated the board on the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston and shared progress reports on future projects like the planned renovation of Randolph Hall, Russell Hall, and Westmorly Court in Adams House.
Offiong emphasized Harvard’s goal of fostering inclusivity in Cambridge and advancing its own research and scholarship through its projects.
“Any changes we make to the campus have to align with our campus planning principles,” she said. “We want to be a good neighbor.”
Harvard Chief Sustainability Officer Heather A. Henriksen continued the presentation by outlining the University’s dedication to a “healthier, resilient, fossil fuel-free future.” She said Harvard has set climate goals to be “fossil fuel neutral” by 2026 and “fossil fuel free” by 2050.
Thomas J. Lucey, who serves as director of government and community relations at Harvard, concluded with an update on the University’s engagements with Cambridge public schools.
Harvard currently offers educational programs for elementary school students as well as summer programs for high school students, including the Harvard Crimson Summer Academy and the Cambridge Harvard Summer Academy, according to Harvard’s presentation.
“The takeaway I’d like you to have is that we're in every Cambridge public school,” Lucey said. “So as the student makes his way from grade to grade to grade to grade eventually through high school, he or she will be touched by a Harvard program multiple times in that process.”
During the question and answer session, planning board member Louis J. Bacci Jr. said the universities could do a better job advertising their school programs to reach a more diverse demographic.
“I talked to a lot of people who know very little of the programs that are available in the city,” he said. “Sometimes the claims are that these are very cliquey and people associated with the universities know about these more than the intended communities.”
Planning board member Corinne Espinoza said Cambridge area universities should work together and build off of each others’ programs to offer services to city residents.
“What if Lesley, Harvard, and MIT all allowed Cambridge residents to board your shuttles for free?” she asked. “What would that mean for our community?”
Espinoza ended the night by reminding Harvard, MIT and Lesley to consider if their institutional values matched Cambridge’s values as a “sanctuary city” that prioritizes equity and justice.
She encouraged each university to consider renaming streets and buildings named after slave owners and requested that each university share how much they have invested in the prison and fossil fuel industries.
“I want to encourage you to let us know either how you are looking at those topics or whether you have plans to look at those topics,” Espinoza said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the next stages of the search for new Winthrop House faculty deans in an email to Winthrop residents Tuesday.
In his email, Khurana said the College would soon begin accepting nominations for faculty dean candidates, a process he called a “critical first step.”
Current interim faculty deans Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan have led the House since August, following the College’s decision to not renew former Winthrop faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson’s contract amid a controversy over Sullivan’s decision to represent Hollywood producer and accused sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein.
Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan wrote in an email to Winthrop residents Tuesday that they were “honored” by Khurana’s request to temporarily take over the role, and said their time in Winthrop has been a “special blessing.”
“Our experience has been every bit as rewarding as we had imagined, and we hope that this year has positively moved the House forward,” they wrote. “Getting to know each of you in settings both formal and informal has been the highlight of the year and we will always be grateful for the warm welcome and many extensions of kindness to both of us and our daughters Madeleine and Kathleen.”
Some Winthrop students hoped Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan would continue their stay in the House. A group of Winthrop residents began circulating a petition urging the administration to install the Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan as permanent faculty deans in the fall. Several students said the Gearans greatly improved the culture and morale within the House.
Former Winthrop House Committee chair Fotini Anastopoulos ’20, who helped create the petition, said it garnered support from over half the house’s student body.
“Ever since their start as faculty deans, Winthrop has seen an increase in community, house spirit, and overall living quality. This petition is directed towards the Harvard administration and aims to show how Mark and Mary have become vital to Winthrop residents and have created an inclusive and welcoming home for us all,” the petition read.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the Gearans were announced as interim deans who would serve only for the year, referring to an announcement made in the fall about the impending search for new deans.
Anastopoulos said that she was disappointed to hear about the start of the search.
“Everything that they did was for the students, and they were so present and engaged and just loving in every way. So I'm very disappointed that the school decided to not keep them for longer,” she said.
Aside from circulating the petition over the Winthrop House email list, students disseminated flyers throughout the rooms, according to Alexander S. “Sandy” Koenig ’21. He said he was impressed by how Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan improved House culture, citing open houses they hosted and artwork in the hallways they installed.
“Why not just take the opportunity to appoint faculty dean the students already really love and want to have stay in the house?” he said. “The College is missing an opportunity for a total slam dunk here.”

Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley “will be moving forward in the near future” with an internal review of his department in response to a recent report of racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism, according to an email he sent to HUPD employees Tuesday night.
The email, which was obtained by The Crimson, comes on the heels of a Crimson investigation that found repeated instances of racism and sexism in the department over the span of nearly three decades. In lawsuits, discrimination complaints, and interviews, 21 current and former HUPD employees alleged the department’s leadership favors certain officers and retaliates against those who come forth with concerns regarding the department’s climate.
These employees accused Riley of being the source of a toxic culture within the department.
In his email, Riley addressed The Crimson’s investigation and wrote that he will set in motion his own assessment of the department.
“While the article relies on and reports on multiple incidents and lawsuits dating back many years, the overarching allegations of racism, sexism, and favoritism are serious,” the chief wrote. “Like every organization, within the HUPD, there are steps we can take to improve.”
“I will be moving forward in the near future with efforts to evaluate our structure, processes and internal climate,” he added. “This includes reviewing and reminding all of us that we have clear and effective processes through which to both raise and address internal conflicts, misconduct or incidents in an appropriate and professional manner.”
Riley invited members of the department to come forth with concerns and suggestions.
“I urge all of you to share your thoughts and ideas for how we can, working together, strengthen and maintain the high standards of professionalism and the delivery of high-quality service the students, faculty, staff and visitors to this University expect and deserve,” he wrote to employees.
At the same time, the chief cited efforts he has implemented to improve the department since arriving at Harvard 24 years ago. These initiatives included strengthening relationships between HUPD officers and University affiliates, recruiting a more diverse police force, and providing diversity training to officers.
“In the last five years, HUPD staff have received approximately 3,400 hours of diversity, inclusion, and belonging related training,” Riley wrote.
Riley also wrote that the department has put in place standard procedures for promotions and discipline.
The chief said in his email that Harvard police officers play a vital role on campus and that University affiliates must trust the department to keep them safe.
“I do want to emphasize the pride I have in this Department,” Riley wrote. “The critical role we have in Harvard University’s mission is not small, and the impact of our work is felt and relied upon by every member of this community.”
“It should go without saying, if any member of our community can’t have confidence in our commitment to their safety and wellbeing, we are failing,” he added.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s 38 seasons commanding the Harvard bench, the 2019-20 campaign could have easily been written off as a ‘transition year’.
The Crimson lost just shy of 58 percent of its scoring from last season, much of what constituted the on-court core and off-court heart of the program. Lead scorer Katie Benzan elected to sit out her senior season to preserve her graduate eligibility, while Harvard also bid farewell to sharpshooter Madeline Raster, slasher Sydney Skinner, rhythm-disrupter Nani Redford, and energy-deliverer Kelsey Bogdan to graduation.
Only three of the eight returners had averaged more than 10 minutes per game last season, one of whom — lead rebounder Jadyn Bush — would be sidelined for much of the 2019-20 campaign due to offseason shoulder surgery. Further complicating matters to start this season for Coach Delaney-Smith was that she did not even have enough healthy bodies for a full 5-on-5 in practice, due to a bevy of smaller injuries.
“We arrived on the first opening day of preseason and there were no forwards,” Delaney-Smith said. “Oh my god, every single one of them was out. Maddie [Stuhlreyer], Rachel [Levy], Jadyn [Bush], Jeannie [Boehm], Maria [Guramare], all of them gone.”
That first practice, in many ways, perfectly represented the tabula rasa from which Delaney-Smith, co-captains Levy and Mackenzie Barta, and the team’s veterans have had to mold this brand-new team featuring five first-years and four new starters. But in an unpredictable season that could have gone down the wrong path, the Crimson has retooled and embraced a new set of principles — playing more selflessly and building composure in high-pressure situations, taking pride on the defensive end, and retaining a focus on delivering points from beyond the arc.
And although this team is nowhere near perfect, there have been several glimpses — including this weekend’s win over Penn in which it avenged last season’s blowout Ivy Tournament loss — that showed that this side may have more to give than simply building for the future.
Sitting 2-2 in Ivy play, the 2019-2020 Crimson side is unquestionably building an intriguing on-court product that is worth keeping an eye on.
DEVELOPING CHEMISTRY
Dispersed throughout conversations with the team this season is the word selfless.
“I was a bit unsure going into this season about who we would be, [but] I have nothing but positive things to say about this team,” stated senior forward Jeannie Boehm following the team’s win over FAU in late December. “As I mentioned, I think our strong suit is...the selfless basketball we're playing. I think every game we have a different high scorer and no one cares. And so I think that's the beauty of this team.”
As alluded to by Boehm, the Crimson has indeed featured seven players who have been the lead scorers in their 17 games this season. There is no question that first-year Lola Mullaney, who Delaney-Smith called at the very start of the season her team’s “superstar” and has topped the Crimson’s scoring sheet in 10 of those games, has been the key focus on opposing scouting reports.
Currently leading the Crimson and sixth in the Ivies in scoring at 15.3 points per game, the Colts Neck, N.J., native has impressed notably from beyond the arc, where she is shooting at a 36 percent clip and has converted an average of 3.3 makes per game.
But with the range of scoring options on this team — including breakout sophomores Maggie McCarthy and Tess Sussman who transitioned from bench contributors to regular starters this season — the expectation is not for Lola to take full responsibility for the team’s offensive production, according to Delaney-Smith.
“When you have someone that can score like Lola, now everyone stops scoring and they look for Lola — well, I don't want that,” Delaney-Smith said. “You know, we had a little bit of that with Katie Benzan. I don't want that.”
To facilitate scoring opportunities, the team has relied on McCarthy to play out of position at the point guard position, something teammates and coaches have lauded her for embracing. Fifth among Ivy players in assists this season at 3.3 per game, McCarthy also leads the Ancient Eight in minutes played.
“She's just a sophomore, she didn't play a ton of minutes last year, so she's become like our floor leader,” Barta said. “Our point guard, doing all of the intangible things, and I know that might not show up on the scoresheet, but we definitely all appreciate it. So I think she's one of the most gritty players.”
With McCarthy making this transition and Sussman also moving from a guard to forward this season, Delaney-Smith noted a particular challenge this year has been balancing the more pedagogical side of coaching with allowing her players to establish chemistry and rhythm to their games.
“But the only way to get them to connect with each other is to play five-on-five,” Delaney-Smith said. “So I have to balance out what skills we work on individually, time being the big issue here, and then how much five-on-five?”
The Harvard coach complemented the five freshmen’s acuity in picking up her schematic system early on in the season, but has acknowledged there is still a learning curve towards building a fully cohesive unit. Still, players such as Barta have noted the equally important role of leadership in creating a more consistent and composed team.
“Everyone's a great basketball player on this team and has confidence, so I think it's just bringing a team together and maintaining that poise is something I found really important,” Barta said.
Facing pressure and defenders who “get up in your grill” continues to be the major focus on this relatively inexperienced side, but the team is confident that it is making progress in slowing the game down.
“I think it's gonna be something we're gonna have to continue to work on,” Levy said. “I think any team not just us specifically, like, that's really hard to play against when someone's up on you and you have to work to get open every single time down the court. But I think that that's fixable… so it's just something we keep on pumping and practice to keep working on.”
DEFENSE-ORIENTED
As the offense continues its acclimation process, the Crimson has established its core identity around limiting its opponents on the defensive end.
“I think we take we need to take a lot of pride in our identity as a defensive team,” said Boehm. “We're really, really good.”
“I think their work ethic is especially deep in the defensive end, game in and game out,” added Delaney-Smith. “Yeah, that's where they're at their best. That's our strength.”
Over the course of this past season, the Crimson has held opponents to an average of 55.2 points per game, about a nine-point improvement from last season. Furthermore, opponent field-goal percentage, which currently sits at 36.2, has also dropped by about four points. On the defensive boards, Harvard tops the Ancient Eight with 29.7 rebounds per game.
These metrics reveal what has been spoken in words, that the gritty nature of this team this season has shown itself in full force on the less glamorous side of the court.
“Defense is all heart, and it's not technique,” Delaney-Smith said. “It's just how hard are you willing to work and I think we work really hard. We still make mistakes, but as long as you work hard, it's okay.”
Of the Crimson’s 11 wins, four have come in games where the offense has scored less than 60 points, including the most recent 58-51 victory over Penn. If difficult droughts of scoring or messy play pervades during spurts of inconsistency, this young and inexperienced team will likely need to depend on that inner defensive drive to eke out victories.
THREE-HEAVY OFFENSE (STILL)
Gone is program triples record-holder Katie Benzan, who was responsible for 34.3 percent of all Crimson three-point attempts last season. As a team, the Crimson averaged 28.1 attempts from deep last season, with 43.5 percent of all field goals coming from behind the arc.
But from the simple eye-test and across various metrics, Harvard’s reliance on the triple has not waned one bit, as shooting numbers are also close to on-par with last year’s roster.
Starting with Lola Mullaney — Benzan’s replacement in many ways as the team’s primary scorer and three-point weapon — the stat sheet shows that she is shooting about 9.06 triples per game, with an accuracy of 36.0 percent. Katie shot at a similar quantity (9.63/G) and success rate (35.6%), although Mullaney is less dependent on the triple in her overall shot selection. 61.5 percent of Lola’s shot attempts this season are from deep, compared to Benzan’s 77.06 percent.
Complementing Mullaney are mainly McCarthy, Sussman, Barta, and Levy, who have collectively converted on 77 triples this season. Barta has been the most accurate from that group outside of Mullaney, knocking down 33 percent of her attempts.
“I think that we have a lot of great shooters on our team which makes us really valuable because you can't just lock in on one person,” Mullaney said. “And when we're hitting our shots especially from three, we tend to get bigger leads right from the start.”
From a spacing perspective, the Crimson’s current clip of 25.9 triple attempts per game has also preserved much of the room for post-dependent Boehm to operate. As has been the case for the past four seasons, Harvard has relied on Boehm’s interior prowess to counterbalance its perimeter shooting — the senior is on pace for her best scoring season with current point averages of 9.8 PPG over 198 shot attempts.
“I've been fortunate to play with great three point shooters throughout my career, but I think this year we have so many of them,” Boehm said. “And so it's nice for me because if they double, somebody is open. It's nice to have that back and forth and not feel frustrated if there's congestion in the post.”
The Crimson currently pace the Ivy League in three-pointers made per game at 8.2, but look to improve upon its 31.6 percent conversion rate (currently sixth in the Ancient Eight). With 45.7 percent of its shots coming from deep (a 2-plus percent uptick from last season), there is no turning back on this offense’s reliance on the triple to get points on the board.
~
This past Saturday, the Crimson faced off against Princeton and fell by a 60-46 score against the one-loss Ivy powerhouses. In the face of an apparent leg injury to co-captain Barta early in the second quarter, the team fought valiantly but could not withstand a third-quarter sprint from the Tigers.
Post-game, Coach Delaney-Smith delivered a notably confident pronouncement about her team, one that very much contextualized the progress the Crimson had made since its very beginnings in September.
“As big as everybody builds Princeton out to be, I think on any given night, if we keep growing and God willing we get Jadyn back, I think [Princeton] is a beatable team. So that's what I'm hoping for.”
With a month-and-change left in the Ivy season, there is evidently a continued emphasis on growth and unity in this young roster. But infused throughout the developmental process, there also appears to be a healthy dose of optimism and confidence that this tight-knit unit can in fact exceed expectations.

Love it: Night Student for the Win – Anna M. Peters
Pulled an all-nighter the night before? Thinking about ditching your 9 a.m. because you simply have no motivation to be up that early? With class in the evening, that is something no longer worth worrying about. More importantly, you don’t have to feel guilty about starting readings the night before they’re due, or choosing to watch The Bachelor instead. This extra cushion of time gives you a guilt-free night of sleep, even when you do procrastinate. In fact, with the extra hours that you will be getting, you may finally be able to avoid every college student’s nightmare: sleep deprivation.
Though evening classes may mean skipping dinner or falling asleep in class, you’d be lying to yourself if you denied the fact that you’re already skipping breakfast or dozing off in your morning classes. Additionally, think about how many fewer tourists there are at night. Say goodbye to waiting in human traffic and witnessing the tragedy that is eager tourists trying to get a picture touching John Harvard’s foot. Evening classes also allow for a more flexible schedule. After all, Harvard students are always on the go, and those daytime hours may be the extra time you need in order to comp a few more clubs, run a few more miles along the Charles, or actually leave the Harvard bubble and go into Boston sometime.
Still unsure about that 6 p.m. class you signed up for? Thinking about dropping or switching to an earlier class that manages to prevent you from ever having lunch again? Think again, because evening classes truly are a blessing in disguise.
Hate it: Early Bird Gets the Worm – Christine Lee
We’ve all been there at some point during our college careers: eyes drooping, pencil dragging across the paper, the professor’s words going in through one ear and out the other. Those hour-and-15-minute lectures seem never-ending when your caffeine intake is running low and sleep deprivation is at an all-time high. So why in the world would you subject yourself to an evening discussion when it’s hard enough to stay awake through your 1:30 p.m. class?
Taking a night class is basically like commiting to a serious, semester-long relationship — they force you to shift around your eating schedule, social life, and pset-cramming sessions altogether. Imagine how much more convenient it would be to finish all of your classes by 2:45 p.m., take your afternoon nap, and still have time to eat dinner before submitting a decently written essay by midni— I mean, 11:59 p.m. (*chef’s kiss*).
Anyone who willingly ranks an evening section as their top choice for a course must have either had no other viable option or is the kind of person to actually read the entire Terms and Conditions page. Do yourself a favor and avoid night classes at all costs — otherwise, you’re just signing up for an expensive post-dinner nap two times a week at the expense of your GPA (*gasp*). Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
