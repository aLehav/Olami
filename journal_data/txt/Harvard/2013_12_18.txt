After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2001, the United States spent $287 billion on defense spending. By 2012, defense spending had skyrocketed to $689 billion. Much of the increase in spending comes from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Having spent almos $2 trillion over the past 10 years on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has more ships, more tanks, and more aircraft than any other country. The U.S. military retains better global logistics, infrastructure, communications, and intelligence than any other military. America owns the only truly global military force and no other country is even attempting to build a global force to rival that of the U.S.
In the past, spending has gone down after times of war—the Pentagon’s budget decreased by 43 percent after the Korean War, by 33 percent after Vietnam, and by 36 percent after the fall of the Soviet Union. But there has been no such drawdown, even as American troops have begun returning from the Middle East. Although sequestration originally mandated cutting the Pentagon’s budget by 10 percent, the new budget deal will reduce the cuts in half, to a more modest five percent. Altogether, defense spending by the United States will still constitute about 40 percent of the world’s total.
But instead of cutting defense spending, the budget deal has shifted the cuts from the Pentagon to military and federal workers’ pensions; this will greatly harm both veterans and civilians in their later years. The new budget deal also comes at the expense of federal research in a number of key areas, such as work being done on fossil fuels. It is clear then that the current levels of defense spending are harming the government’s ability to properly appropriate funds for its other responsibilities.
We are faced today with the issues of a gaping deficit, a burdensome debt, and the lingering effects of a severe recession. According to Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “The single, biggest threat to our national security is our debt”—more than military dangers from any nation or terrorist group. The national debt represents a burden, a liability, and a problem that has the potential to crash the global financial system. To reduce the threat of defaulting on the debt, the U.S. government must reduce its budget deficit. And that entails cutting defense spending.
Reducing the funds given to the Pentagon will also allow the government to be more flexible with its spending. The country has other problems that desperately need increased funding. Public school education in the U.S. has been lagging behind other developed countries for many years and requires widespread reforms and improvements. Transportation infrastructure also requires additional investment; there are numerous areas in need of change, ranging from increased train, tram, and bus networks to airport improvements and bridge maintenance. Cutting defense spending would free up funds to spend in these areas.
Opponents of cuts to the defense budget argue that such cuts will limit the country’s military capabilities. But this belief is misguided. Defense spending can be reduced without threatening the military’s power. Eliminating some of the many bureaucratic problems within the Department of Defense could save billions of dollars, without limiting our ability to defend the nation’s borders.
One issue is that the Department of Defense ovelaps the work of other government departments. The Pentagon spends about $600 million per year on research focused on non-military related diseases also combatted by the National Institutes of Health.
The biggest wastes of duplication, though, can be seen in the Pentagon’s massive back-office, which contains 800,000 civil servants, 536,000 active duty military personnel who are never deployed, and 700,000 contractors. This leads to overhead costs that accounted for 42 percent of the defense budget as of 2008. Cutting the overhead costs for defense to a rather reasonable 25 percent (an average from 25 major industries) would save $80 billion a year.
Other issues, primarily surrounding contractors and weapons manufacturers, exist as well. A report in 2011 suggested that defense firms have swindled $1.1 trillion from the Pentagon over the past decade. Moreover, Congressional interference drives up the cost of manufacturing weapons, leading to $18,000 oil pans and $300 million fighter jets.
All of these factors suggest that defense spending can easily be cut by sizable amounts without ever comprising the military’s ability to defend the nation. Eliminating some of the inefficiencies within the Pentagon can save tens, perhaps hundreds, of billions of dollar each year, helping to reduce the debt and allowing more of the government budget to be spent in other problem areas.
For the sake of the nation, defense spending must be cut.

Last year, the Open Hillel movement formed after Harvard Hillel refused to host an organization that advocates the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement against Israel. Existing Hillel International policies ban organizations that advocate BDS or similar views that Hillel International frames as anti-Israel. Open Hillel seeks to make Hillel inclusive of all political views concerning the state of Israel.
In early December, Swarthmore’s Hillel became the first Open Hillel, officially opening its doors to speakers who oppose Israel. In response, Hillel International President Eric D. Fingerhut released a statement affirming that no organization that welcomes “anti-Zionists” will be permitted to use the Hillel name. This sentiment is consistent with Hillel International’s “Standards of Partnership,” but it denies individual chapters the freedom to define their communities as they see fit.
Hillel International’s Israel Guidelines, adopted in 2010, stipulate that no Hillel chapter may host or partner with any individual or organization that opposes the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, “demonizes, delegitimizes, or applies a double standard to Israel,” or endorses “boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against the State of Israel.” At the same time, Hillel International emphasizes its status as an organization that “welcomes students of all backgrounds.” Many Jewish students—including Jewish students at Harvard—support allowing pro-BDS speakers at Hillel, or may even support BDS. Those students, despite being part of Jewish communities on campuses across the country, have official constraints imposed on their political ideals in most Hillel chapters.
At the least, Hillel International should not castigate chapters such as Swarthmore that choose to be “open.” Swarthmore is in a unique position compared to many Hillels in that it receives no funding from Hillel International—but even those Hillels that are funded by the central organization should be free to define their communities. Hillel International’s reaction to Open Hillel at Swarthmore, however, suggests that the organization will not tolerate adoption of alternative Israel guidelines by its campus chapters.
College campuses ought to be places of deep and thoughtful debate. As an organization that characterizes itself primarily as a pluralistic center of Jewish life, Hillel International should not make participation in Jewish life contingent on holding particular political views about the Middle East. Hillel should allow Swarthmore Hillel to remain open and encourage all of its chapters to decide on their own levels of “openness.”

In early 2007, I fell in love. The object of my affections had a quick wit, an abhorrence of hypocrisy, a fondness for profanity, and an all-consuming desire to make the world stand still. Some—himself included—might have called him crazy, or dumb, or whiny. Others might have called him exactly what he called them: phony. But to me, Holden Caulfield was perfect.
Head over heels with my nose buried in the crisp pages of “Catcher in the Rye,” I joined the masses of misunderstood middle-schoolers in their adulation of the novel’s hero: Guys want to be him, and girls want to be with him. Why? Like most things, it’s all in the timing.
Middle school is hard. Kids are jerks. You’re still trying to grow out your hair from its old tomboy length, but what was once a bowl cut now looks like you’re wearing a small garbage bin on your head, and you can barely see through your bangs to notice the other girls laughing at you. Adults? They don’t get it either. Dad’s busy with work, and Mom spent hours making that meal, so “[name redacted] said my crush on him was like a virus” hardly constitutes a valid reason for crying over your dinner instead of eating it.
Holden turns the cons in our lives into pros. Insecurity becomes transcendence. He tells us that we feel alone because we possess the smarts—and the maturity—to view society in a way that others don’t. Suddenly, feeling alienated means feeling even more grown-up than the grown-ups. We embrace Holden’s cynicism as the mark of true superiority of mind, and we make it our own.
But Holden’s insecurity is just insecurity. He views society in a way that others don’t because he cannot look past himself and into the lives of others. In his alienation, he is not grown-up—he is a child. Holden suffers so much in part because he refuses to accept suffering. Instead of coming to terms with his demons, Holden lashes out against even those who aim to help him. As he tries to freeze time, he only holds himself in arrested development.
We never see Holden grow up—but we do it ourselves. I know I did, even if it took me a while to break things off with my erstwhile literary paramour. I saw phonies all around me in high school, and that didn’t change at Harvard. Certain of my friendlessness and mired in self-pity, I came home for break last year and pulled Catcher off the shelf immediately. I reveled in my old annotations like Holden perusing Phoebe’s notebooks.
Soon enough, though, I got over myself … and Holden. My trials and tribulations did not disappear, of course. Rather, I found people who submitted not only to hearing about them but also to helping me fix them. Plus, these real, live people could sit next to me in Annenberg. I’m home again, now, ready to weather the winter much more happily than I stood out the last. I might crack open “Nine Stories,” but I’ll spend more time talking to companions—platonic and otherwise—who exist off the page.
Sometimes, people really are goddamn rotten, and life seems that way, too. But for every phony, there’s a whole score of princes (and princesses). They’re everywhere: At home, at Harvard, and probably even in Manhattan. Holden cannot grapple with his problems because, instead of connecting, he cuts off. Growing up requires just the opposite—letting others understand us and, in return, trying to understand them.
We may be grateful that we have weathered our younger and more vulnerable years (the target of my next one-sided romance: Nick Carraway) and found ourselves with the world rather than against it. But that doesn’t mean that looking back on our own Pencey Preps and Jane Gallaghers does us any harm. Acknowledging and examining worse times helps us find better ones, especially when we do so not on solitary walks in a freezing Central Park but instead in the company of friends at Burdick’s or Felipe’s.
Sometimes, tell some people everything. It’s not the worst to start missing everybody.

It’s been a great year for the papacy. Pope Francis—the Christ-like Catholic leader recently christened as TIME Magazine’s Person of the Year—awes the world and reinvigorates the hopes of a flagging flock.
Suddenly, Catholicism is not seen with the same vitriol that it has usually prompted. Francis, the first Jesuit to serve as the Holy Father, took as his namesake Saint Francis of Assisi, the ascetic who adopted a life of poverty and penitence in accordance with Jesus’ message. As much as the life of the original Francis might be obscured in hagiographies, the current Francis’ zealous commitment to asceticism is apparent to us all.
Some changes are minor but meaningful—from his decision to keep a simpler apartment rather than move into the Apostolic Palace to the simpler sartorial decisions to forego the red Prada shoes and elaborate miter for plain white cassocks and an iron cross. It’s a kind of austerity that even I could get behind.
Then there are the more hope-inspiring measures: the heightened emphasis on ecumenism and interfaith dialogues—a staple of John Paul II’s papacy that receded to the wayside during Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI’s tenure—is especially encouraging.
From openly blessing and praying with a disfigured man to washing the feet of two women at a Roman youth prison to as yet unconfirmed accounts that he may venture out at night, dressed in the garb of a common priest, to minister to the homeless—making him the first Batman pope as well.
All this bespeaks the humility and sincerity of a man who truly believes what he says, one who practices as he preaches as the proverb goes. That the world has eagerly turned to papal admiration amidst a seemingly inexorable secularization also showcases the bare desire for genuine morality in the institutions that purport to purvey it.
But not all the changes that Pope Francis has brought to the Holy See are warmly accepted. Francis has reversed the emphasis on the social issues like contraception and gay marriage that America most associates with the politically influential Catholic Church in favor of the more Jesuit-oriented practices of caring for the needy and the sick.
That itself should be of little surprise—Francis is the first non-European Pope in 1272 years. Back when he was still Bishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, he garnered a reputation for living simply, frequently dining with the homeless, and relentlessly pursuing interfaith dialogues with other Christian denominations as well as Judaism and Islam. In South America, the Church has retained its social justice spirit more than the conventionally conservative outset we ascribe to it in America and Europe. And the Pope’s progressive regime thus far signals a commitment to that ideal.
He drew criticism and admiration alike when he wrote that atheists might make it to heaven and said in an interview, “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?”
Francis’s recent apostolic exhortation—“Evangelli Gaudium” or “The Joy of the Gospel”—similarly tracked additional reformist attitudes by excoriating what he saw as the excesses of capitalism. He specifically called out disastrous trickle-down theories of economics, noting that “the promise was that when the glass was full, it would overflow, benefiting the poor. But what happens instead, is that when the glass is full, it magically gets bigger and nothing ever comes out for the poor.”
In America, where the bizarre inseparability of capitalism and Christianity in conservative circles remains unabated, and the extent of serious debate covers whether Jesus and Santa Claus were actually white, all this progressivism from the Vatican comes as a shock.
The ensuing logical convulsions are amusing to watch. Rush Limbaugh decried the “pure Marxism” that the Pope was preaching (which the Pope amusingly refused to be offended by), and Fox News has had much cognitive dissonance with the Pope’s description of unfettered capitalism as “a new tyranny.”
As amusing as the dissent may be today, the fundamental drive of the Catholic Church is toward a more relatable and modern religion that cherishes the social justice inherent in the teachings of Jesus Christ as much as the biblical literalism that we’ve come to associate with Christianity in the States. That’s good for both the Catholic Church’s own preservation and probably the world as a whole as well.
Keep on keeping on, Francis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In May 2012, faculty from Harvard University and MIT teamed up to create a massive open online course (MOOC) platform for students and institutions of higher education alike. But unlike its for-profit MOOC peers Coursera and Udacity, edX—the new venture—was guided by more academic, pedagogical goals. By making its source code accessible to the public and licensing the distribution rights to its software, edX now allows participating institutions to adopt its platform for their own use and improve the existing code—for free.
 
Today, edX boasts 1.6 million users from around the world and provides courses from some of the world’s best educational institutions spanning fields from biology and computer science to literature and music.
 
According to its website, edX bases its mission on a three-part philosophy—expanding universal access to education, enhancing teaching and learning both on campus and online, and advancing teaching and learning through research.
 
“This is about experimentation; it’s about research; it’s about rethinking education,” said Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 last May, when the initial partnership between Harvard and MIT was announced.
 
Although conceived by two elite American institutions of higher education, edX has quickly established a global footprint among not only college students, but also working adults and high-schoolers looking to supplement their formal degrees.
 
As edX continues to expand its presence overseas and partners with an increasingly diverse array of non-educational institutions, professors and students agree on the initiative’s international significance but say its precise impact on the landscape of higher education remains uncertain.
 
MOVING QUICKLY
 
What began as a single course on circuits and electronics two years ago has rapidly expanded to a consortium of 30 partner institutions. Although initially, edX’s new partnerships were based solely in the United States, over a dozen foreign institutions have embraced the online learning initiative since February, and both the Chinese and French governments have separately announced the creation of online education portals powered by edX for campuses in their home countries.
 
With 17 international partners, the edX consortium today boasts a presence in countries spanning North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.
 
Perhaps just as striking as the increasingly international profile of edX is its increasing number of partnerships with institutions not associated with higher education that have been announced in the past few months.
 
The International Monetary Fund announced in June that it would be using edX’s open source platform to allow governments and the public to take training courses in economics and finance.
 
LinkedIn, a professional networking site, also announced in November that it would be partnering with edX and other leaders in online education to allow LinkedIn users to add their certifications or other completed coursework to their LinkedIn profiles.
 
Most recently, edX announced a new collaboration with Davidson College and the College Board to create online modules for high school students in Advanced Placement classes.
 
Some professors say that it is too early to tell whether most of these initiatives will have a significant impact on new modes of teaching or on the direction of edX itself.
 
“It’s too early to say,” said Chinese history professor Peter K. Bol, Harvard’s Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, about the impact of edX’s most recent partnerships. “Things have been moving very quickly.”
 
BLENDING MODELS
 
While edX has taken a number of different approaches to expanding its scope online and at a domestic level, perhaps its most significant growth has been through its international presence.
 
As of December, 71 percent of edX students come from outside the United States, and nearly half of all students are from developing countries, according to information sent by an edX associate director of communications. Among non-U.S. countries, India leads the pack with 12 percent of enrollments.
 
Part of the reason for the growing popularity of online education worldwide may be the universal applicability of a learning model that blends both virtual and in-person elements.
 
“Student outcomes are better when students work with teachers in a blended setting on campus,” said Anant Agarwal, president of edX. Because of this phenomenon, “the blended educational model is really mushrooming” in the campus education setting, Agarwal added.
 
Paul Francis, astrophysics professor at Australian National University, first introduced online elements to his classroom two years ago by requiring students to use webcasts to check their work. According to Francis, the percentage of students who completed their work in the 300-person class rose from four percent to 60 percent that year. 
“Online learning has been more effective for us than face-to-face learning,” Francis said. Francis added that younger students may have a different way of learning, which can be difficult for academics his age to appreciate or fully understand. 
This February, ANU officially announced its participation in the edX consortium, and Francis’s astrophysics class will be one of two new courses offered on the platform for the 2014-2015 academic year.
Given the success of his decision to implement webcasts in the classroom, Francis and his colleagues decided to make the move to edX in order to further explore the possibilities of online education applied in the classroom. 
“We felt we should be more involved in this new online space,” said Francis.  “[edX is] a good match.  We’re using edX as an experiment, and they’re using us.  It goes both ways.” 
ANU’s reformatted astrophysics course will have the added benefit of reaching a wider target audience. Besides on-campus students, anyone who is curious in the subject will be able to take the course for free. 
“Students can get a real academic summer learning experience from the beach if they like,” said Francis.
The university will also launch an online summer program experimenting with the new “blended” model of learning. Participating students will take six weeks of online modules before spending one week of intensive in-class study in-person on the ANU campus.
CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS
 
EdX, however, is expanding not just geographically. As it grows its presence domestically and abroad, edX is also redefining what it means to be a student.
 
Although most of the courses offered on the edX platform are taught by college and university faculty, university-age students comprise only 40% of the edX student body, according to an edX media kit. “Continuing learners,” a category that includes adult students beyond traditional university age, make up 55% of the student body, while the remaining 5% consists of high school students. 
 
As a result, some of edX’s most recent collaborations are targeted towards the diverse educational background of its student body. Agarwal said that besides its lofty educational missions, another—perhaps more practical—goal of edX is “to help [students] find jobs and as much as we can.”
 
In its collaboration with LinkedIn, users of the professional networking site will be able to show certification for advanced coursework to potential employers, allowing students no longer enrolled in college or university to leverage their edX coursework in the job market.
 
And even though high school students still only make up a small minority of the platform’s students, edX’s newest partnership with College Board and Davidson College plans to provide innovative and data-driven modes of learning tailored for students preparing to enter college in the United States.
 
In the new collaboration, announced earlier this month, researchers from Davidson College plan to use data from the College Board to design mini-courses on edX to help students master the most difficult concepts on Advanced Placement exams; thus hoping to better prepare high school students for college-level academics.
 
“I think high school is particularly close to my own heart,” Agarwal said. “At the end of the day, if students don’t have the right background [for college courses] they won’t get much out of it.”
 
As edX continues to bring in partner universities and organizations from around the world and diversify the pool of courses offered to the public, Agarwal and other faculty members involved in edX hope that virtual education will become a more transformative source of learning. 
“There is much excitement and much uncertainty in the world of online education,” said history professor William C. Kirby, who co-taught Societies of the World 12: “China” with Bol this past semester. "No one can safely predict where online education will go, but I for one am glad that Harvard has been willing to experiment and to leap a bit into the unknown."

In conjunction with Harvard’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goal, Harvard Athletics facilities have been replacing their dimmer fluorescent lightbulbs with energy-saving LED bulbs to create brighter and more cost-efficient arenas for athletic practice and competition.
The Athletics Lighting Project, which began in the spring of 2012, has installed light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs in the Bright Hockey Center, Gordon Indoor Track, Lavietes Pavilion, and Palmer Dixon—Harvard’s strength and conditioning center. LED bulbs use just one-fifth to one-quarter of the energy harnessed by traditional incandescent light bulbs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
“Our inspiration [for this project] was an opportunity to work with the Office for Sustainability and to help save not only Athletics energy but Harvard’s goal of a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2016,” said Jason Waldron, the Harvard Athletics Operations and Facilities Manager.
According to Waldron, all athletic centers at the University used 750-watt fluorescent bulbs before the installation project—many of which he described as degrading in quality over time.
“The way our old fixtures worked was that they, when we first put them in, they would start out bright, but over time, their lighting output would diminish, and it would turn yellow or orange,” Waldron said. “There was an inconsistency of lights.”
Now, the four centers in which installations have taken place use 380-watt LED bulbs, which can last up to 10 years until they start to diminish, according to Waldron. “Not only are [the LED lights] brighter, and they are much brighter, and there’s a consistency throughout all the buildings,” Waldron said.
Women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith agreed that the lighting was brighter, but she said her team has had “no conscious discussion” about the implementation of the LED lights.
“It’s brighter, and it’s a nicer light, sure,” Delaney-Smith said. “But I would say our players probably didn’t even notice.”
Autumne J. S. Franklin ’16, a hurdler on the track team, said she had not noticed a change. “I think it sounds like a good idea and definitely environmentally-friendly,” Franklin said. “But I didn’t notice so I guess that’s a good thing that we’re not losing anything by having the LED lights.”
According to Waldron, whose contractors work around athletic practices, he and his team hope to expand the Athletics Lighting Project to the Blodgett Pool, the tennis courts, and the Murr Squash courts. “We’re always looking to improve our lighting,” he said.
The Athletics Lighting Project was funded by the Green Revolving Fund, a $12 million revolving loan fund administered by Harvard’s Office for Sustainability. Recipients pay back the loans from the savings they make after switching to more energy-efficient, cost-effective alternatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an a capella concert during Harvard-Yale weekend last month, Harvard alumni took to the stage at Yale.
As per tradition, the Harvard Krokodiloes invited former members in attendance at the concert to perform the group’s alumni song, “Johnny O’ Connor.” About ten former Kroks, ranging from recent graduates to men in their late seventies, joined the current members on stage. Though decades had passed since the last performance of many of these singers, most of them remembered not only the lyrics but also the choreography.
The founding of the Krokodiloes out of the Hasty Pudding Social Club in 1946 marked the beginning of a capella at Harvard. In the last half century, a capella at the College has expanded to include many groups that comprise a growing but tight-knit musical community on campus.
The culture amongst Harvard’s most competitive groups can sometimes seem intense—from the “Hell Week” of auditions to daily half-days of practice prior to concerts to inter-group rivalries. Yet members like the alumni singers at the Krokodiloes concert possess a life-long loyalty to their ensembles. And singers say they love this avenue for participating in the school’s musical scene.
HELL WEEK
With a rising number of a capella groups on campus and group admittance rates sometime lower than the College’s own acceptance rate of about six percent, the first step of joining an a capella group—an audition process called “Hell Week”—can be both stressful and exhilarating for current and prospective members.
The College sports more than ten a capella groups, including recent additions such as KeyChange, a co-ed group that performs music from the black diaspora, and Shani, a Jewish a capella group. Ensembles vary in gender composition, musical choices, and performance style.
During Hell Week, students can audition for one, some, or all of the groups, which host preliminary auditions and multiple callback nights. Auditioners face tough competition, and many pour hours into practicing before auditions, auditioning for current members, and preparing for callbacks. 
Jason S. Friedman ’16, now a member of co-ed contemporary group The Veritones, says that he knew he wanted to sing in a co-ed group going into the audition process because the all-male groups on campus do not sing contemporary music. Though he had prepared songs before coming to college, he says that he spent a few hours a day warming up and practicing solo cuts for each night of callbacks.
Other singers, like Veritones member Skip L. Rosamilia ’17, decided to audition for all of the groups.
Rosamilia says he spent a significant amount of time in practice rooms selecting a song and then practicing to become comfortable with singing the song in front of different groups. “It seemed like [in] every free moment, I had to be really efficient,” he says of audition week. As an incoming freshman adjusting to college life, he adds, managing work during audition week was especially difficult.
Similarly, Michael A. Paladino ’17, a member of the Krokodiloes, says that on any given night he had about six hours of auditions. “Audition week was basically a week where my main event of each day was a capella, and class just seemed to get in the way,” he says.
The stress of Hell Week, however, does not fall only on auditioners. William D. Horton ’15, the musical director of the Veritones, says current members of the group must also prepare for auditions and often deliberate until 3 or 4 a.m. when determining which auditioners to call back. Out of a pool of more than 100 applicants, Horton says, the Veritones could only offer spots to five auditioners.
Hell Week culminates in the Final Night, during which final auditions take place and auditioners complete a preference sheet to indicate which group they will join if they receive multiple invitations. Group members discuss their experiences in a capella and try to convince auditioners to select their group.
“It was almost a tease to show us how great the group is and how much we want to get in,” Rosamilia says.
“I prayed a lot,” Paladino says of Final Night. “Going to sleep that night was definitely not easy.”
PRACTICE, POLISH, PERFORM
The intensity of audition week mirrors the hours of work that group members devote to planning, rehearsing, and performing sets.
A capella groups perform at a variety of functions, including semester jams, weddings, and dinner parties. Some groups also embark on annual national and international tours.
Taylor L. Vandick ’16, a member of Harvard’s oldest all-female group, the Radcliffe Pitches, says that she practices six hours with the entire Radcliffe Pitches group every week and then one hour with the music director fine-tuning her voice part. In the week leading up to a large concert or jam—christened Hell Week just like auditions—Vandick says that the group usually rehearses five-and-a-half hours every day.
Horton, Rosamilia, and Friedman also say that the Veritones practice about six hours a week with more rehearsal time to polish their sets in the weeks leading up to the group’s two main jams.
In addition to rehearsals, groups spend significant time thinking about their set list, conducting auditions to assign solos, and then polishing their performances.
Groups work with each other to coordinate song distributions and ensure that each ensemble sings different songs, a process that Horton says is “currently up for debate in the community.”
Some groups use a database to reserve songs. Others, according to Horton, work through a more relaxed system, in which song selections are based on which ensembles will sing together in concert.
Groups compete not only over members and songs but also for reputation within the a capella community. “Your group always wants to sing better and outdo the others at a jam,” Horton says.
COMMUNITY
Nonetheless, members of the a capella community say that performing music and the friendships formed between and within groups justify the busy schedule of a capella life.  
“My favorite thing about a capella at Harvard is the community it provides,” Horton says.
Paladino agrees, saying that he enjoys the feeling of brotherhood and community provided by the Kroks. “Being a freshman Krok is definitely an interesting experience, as my world was quickly opened from the rather isolated social world of a freshman guy to someone who has 11 brothers around campus to hang out with, ask advice, and all sorts of other things,” he says.
Members say that despite some rivalry, relationships between groups are largely amicable and supportive. Moreover, many students view the growing number of groups as a positive. 
“I think there is some friendly competition, but behind it all, some of my closest friends are in other groups,” Friedman says.
Paladino echoes Friedman’s sentiment. “We all just love music and love to sing,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 18, 2013, at 10:16 p.m.
BOSTON—Eldo Kim, the Harvard sophomore who was charged Tuesday in connection with Monday’s bomb scare on Harvard’s campus, was released from custody after an appearance in U.S. District Court Wednesday.
Kim was arrested Tuesday afternoon after telling authorities that he was responsible for sending emails threatening to bomb four campus buildings in order to avoid taking an exam. Kim could face up to five years of imprisonment, three years of probationary release, and a $250,000 fine if convicted under the federal bomb hoax statute, according to a Tuesday press release from U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz.
Under the terms of his release, Kim will only be able to enter Harvard grounds if authorized in advance by University officials and the court’s pretrial services office. He will also need to be escorted by either his sister or his uncle, whom the court appointed as his guardians.
In a hearing that began at noon and then quickly recessed until 3:30 p.m., Kim appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith G. Dein and was accompanied by public defender Ian Gold and private attorney Allison D. Burroughs. Gold was subsequently appointed as Kim’s counselor. Assistant U.S. Attorney John A. Capin served as the federal prosectutor.
Capin said at the beginning of the hearing that he and the defense attorneys began negotiations early Wednesday morning regarding alternatives to detention.
During the proceedings, Burroughs requested that Kim receive permission to return to Harvard’s campus so that he could pick up his belongings. Dein indicated that she had no objection to the request.
Kim’s terms of release also dictates that he remain in Massachusetts, and that he and his guardians co-sign a $100,000 bail bond, though it will only have to be paid if Kim violates the terms of his release.
Urging Kim to comply with the terms of his release, Dein emphasized the bond’s expense.
“It’s a very serious obligation even though you don’t have to put up anything now,” Dein said.
The gallery at Kim’s hearing appeared to be predominantly occupied by members of the press. Kim’s uncle and sister were also in attendance.

CORRECTION: Jan. 14, 2014
An earlier version of this story and the caption of the photo accompanying it incorrectly identified the employment status of one of the attorneys representing Eldo Kim ’16. In fact, Allison D. Burroughs is an attorney in private practice not a public defender.
