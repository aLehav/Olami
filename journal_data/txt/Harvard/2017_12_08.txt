After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Compared to the grandeur of Widener Library, which is frequented by students at the College, the more modest Kennedy School Library is perhaps reflective of its school’s public service mission. The cavernous library is nonetheless practical and widely used by the student body. Outside, there are red sofas where students can take a respite from classes and catch up on current affairs. The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Financial Times are all on display. Magazines such as the The Economist, The Atlantic, and Harper’s are also lined-up and available for perusal. However, given the narrow range of views and voices these publications represent, this space is literally and figuratively an “echo chamber.”
Source bias is a behavioral bias which weighs information (even if identical in nature) from one source higher than another based on preconceived notions of reputation, influence, and authority. As a crude example, the 2018 stock predictions of the Wall Street Journal are likely to be heeded with greater weight than the Belmont Investment Club’s monthly newsletter.
However, what happens when the “sources” we hold with esteem are so out of touch and divorced from reality that they are plainly inaccurate?
“Hillary Clinton has an 85 percent chance to win” predicted the New York Times on the eve of the U.S. election. Pivit, a polling application which has a partnership with CNN, declared that Trump “had a 1 percent chance to win the GOP nomination.” 2016 was a bad year for prognosticators. In the era of ‘big data’ and hyper-connectivity, how did we get so disconnected?
These trends will only get worse. Traditional media’s advertising and circulation revenues are in structural decline. This means the budgets for in-depth and investigative journalism will only shrink—accuracy, deep analysis, and predictive power will only be curtailed by dwindling finances.
We need to re-think the range of sources we rely on and consume so we can better understand our more complex and polarized society. Reading widely and beyond the traditional sources, even if we confront views which sharply conflict with our own, is imperative if we seek to find common ground and understand both sides of the political divide.
This too must start in the classrooms and libraries at Harvard. Too often the assigned syllabus readings  come from the “me-too,” consensus echo-chamber of the New York Times and FT—sources which no longer have their finger on the country’s political pulse. Like it or not, what were once “fringe voices” are increasingly the mainstream.
To illustrate this issue, I took a random sample of 10 Harvard Kennedy School class syllabi. Then, using Pew Research’s “ideological placement” analysis, which ranks media outlets along a liberal-conservative spectrum, I mapped the HKS assigned readings from newspapers and magazines to these rankings. Easily over 95 percent were “liberal biased” according to Pew’s classifications. Is this what we want? Did we come to Harvard to reinforce our existing beliefs? Or do we truly want to deepen our understanding of all viewpoints?
More than 40 percent of Trump supporters get their news from Fox News, the most watched cable TV network in America, and yet not a single syllabus made reference to this critical source. Good public policy and leadership seek to bridge division. But we can only do that if we know what those divisions are in the first place.
“They don’t have a voice!” is an often-cited catch-all to describe the many disenfranchised Trump and Brexit voters. But this is ivory-tower nonsense. They do have a voice, and they are using it.  We just aren’t listening. Their voices are loud and clear in Breitbart News, Fox News, and the Washington Examiner. While Harvard professors may denigrate these sources as "intellectually" inferior, given their increasingly popular appeal and reach, ignoring them misses the full picture.
If the path towards a robust and functioning public discourse involves an understanding of many diverse voices and viewpoints, then we are doing ourselves a disservice by failing to listen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following my sophomore year, I spent a summer in D.C. working for the Pentagon. Occasionally, my supervisor would let me off early, and I would find myself sitting alone by our capital’s marble monuments, scrolling through Instagram, checking my Snapchat, and reloading my email, waiting for a notification or two to keep me busy. Normally, I’d scroll through my Facebook newsfeed, but the safety orientation at work had pressured me to deactivate my account for the duration of my stay in D.C.
During our first week of work, all interns were made to take part in a presentation on operational security. We were warned that our supervisors could monitor our social media activity, and any online references to our work could land us in serious legal trouble. The presenter pointed to cases of interns being contacted via Facebook by foreign intelligence agencies and unintentionally compromising state secrets. Given my proclivity for communist jokes and the abundance of foreign nationals on my newsfeed, I subsequently decided to deactivate my Facebook to prevent misunderstandings between my employers and myself. Consequently, I was left with two social media platforms—Instagram and Snapchat—to communicate with my friends from home.
One Friday afternoon, having left work early, I decided to visit the Smithsonian Air and Space museum. Being the dork that I am, I took pictures of every plane and plaque, overwhelmed by the historical beauty surrounding me. However, nature’s call grabbed my attention midway through the Word War II aviation exhibit, and I soon found myself shamelessly destroying a Smithsonian toilet. As I sat on my porcelain throne, I swiped through the various photos I had taken, debating which one to share on Instagram. Sadly, no single photo could do justice to my complete photographic collection, leaving me mindlessly scrolling as I tested the strength of Smithsonian plumbing.
After four or five minutes of scrolling, I was struck by an unusual pang of self-hatred. Why did I care to tell the world that I had seen a German Focke-Wulf 190 with my own eyes? I had never felt the need to validate my love for historical artifacts when I was younger, so why did I feel as though I needed to prove to strangers that I had done something fun that Friday afternoon? Thus, in an odd moment of historically-induced frustration, I deleted my Instagram account, flushed the toilet, and proceeded to enjoy the rest of the exhibit.
Later that evening, as I awaited the bus that would take me home, I opened Snapchat, the sole social media platform left to accompany me. As I sat on the bus, I once again felt a pang of personal frustration. I had always complained about lacking time for leisure readings and calling my loved ones, and yet, there I sat again, wasting my evening looking through the lives of familiar strangers. Arriving home, I deleted my Snapchat, threw myself on the couch, and stared at a phone devoid of notifications.
As the days turned to weeks, I occasionally felt an anxiety induced by my cold turkey withdrawal from social media. I watched as others around me scrolled and swiped away, feeling a sort of virtual isolation from the outside world. Nevertheless, I learned to cope with my self-imposed virtual exile, eventually transforming my anxiety into a sense of relief. Instead of playing an endless game of virtual catch up, I grew comfortable with silence and enjoyed more personal time. I read for fun, wrote letters to random friends, practiced Russian, and—for first time in years—took pictures for the sake of having pictures for my future self.
Early August marked the end of my time in D.C. and subsequent return to Facebook. As expected, my newsfeed remained a cesspool of rude comments, worthless opinions, and photographs of individuals I barely spoke to. Although I contemplated doing away with Facebook completely, a few long-term projects forced me to recognize Facebook Messenger’s organizational utility. For the time being, Facebook was here to stay.
We’ve been deceived by Silicon Valley into thinking that its platforms can grant us happiness. The truth is, we’re mortals with an ever-shrinking amount of time left on earth. As such, time remains the most valuable commodity you can give to a person or cause. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat create the illusion that you can simultaneously remain connected with everyone. However, time is an investment; if you cast your net wide and invest your time in a sea of strangers, you’ll soon find yourself surrounded by nothing but virtual likes.
Upon commissioning in May, I intend to delete my Facebook. Perhaps sometime after completing BOLC (Basic Officer Leader Course), I’ll make a new account and craft a useful newsfeed. I don’t want to see long-winded political opinions, mild memes, or pictures of that guy I kinda-sorta knew in middle school. What I care to know is which of my closest comrades are moving, getting married, having kids, or returning from deployment. When I look at my future friends list, I want to be able to say that I’d go camping or grab a beer with any of them at a moment’s notice. I want to be able to boast that, despite my seemingly meager list of Facebook friends, I’d be willing to fight tooth and nail for each and every one of them. I don’t want a tool for social validation or a source of likes; what I really want is a warm virtual reminder that, despite physical distance, my closest friends are always there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The inauguration of Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 came hand-in-hand with the end of their predecessors’ tenures. In that vein, we wish to thank former UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and former UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 for their dedicated service to the undergraduate community over the course of the past year.
In the past, we have been critical of some of their actions. We’ve questioned the statistical methodology behind their polling the College on unrecognized social organizations, and we’ve highlighted the ways in which Sachee could have better handled her dual role as UC President and final club member. We’ve also challenged the effectiveness of Sachee and Khansarinia’s application of the Q Guide to on-campus organizations. In fact, its low participation rate seems to have confirmed our suspicions in that regard, and we once again express our hope that the UC will find a stronger way for students to truly learn about on-campus organizations they’re considering joining.
More generally, Khansarinia’s acknowledgment that it would be “impossible to accomplish” all of their goals speaks to a trend—which is not limited to the outgoing administration—of UC leadership campaigns promising more than they can feasibly complete in a year. Future UC leaders, and the undergraduate student body as a whole, would be better served by breaking this cycle, which would also allow for students to more fairly evaluate their tenures. It is not immediately clear to the student body how best to judge its outgoing leaders when it’s a given that not everything they claim that they aim to do is realistic. We hope that future UC leadership tickets can keep feasibility as a priority when crafting their platforms.
Yet, while we stand by our critiques, no reflection on Sachee and Khansarinia’s term would be complete without recognizing, and expressing gratitude for, their successes. Their collaboration with the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations to fund events during Opening Days to make the College more welcoming brought tangible good to the Class of 2021. Additionally, we hope Khansarinia’s assertion that he and Sachee have “set the stage” for a long-term revamping of House-based social life will come to fruition, and we look forward to seeing its results and the results of other initiatives Sachee and Khansarinia undertook that will affect the campus community over a longer time scale.
We appreciate and respect the stronger aspects of their performance, as well as express our hope that Zhang and Boucher will pick up where Sachee and Khansarinia left off in fulfilling their own campaign promises. With the implementation of their first initiative already underway—a “matchmaking grant” intended to fund social events between on-campus organizations—we’re glad to see that they’re well on their way to doing so.

Citing rising rents, Harvard Square pizzeria The Just Crust will officially close after being shuttered for “renovations” since July.
The Brattle St. pizzeria was known for its variety of signature thin crust pizzas. While the restaurant has had a sign pasted to its front door since July 15 telling patrons it would be closing for renovations, the owners announced this week they have ultimately chosen not to renew their lease.
Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, co-owner of The Just Crust, wrote in an emailed statement that she and her husband have been weighing their options since July and only recently decided to give up their license in advance of the December deadline.
“With the high rent in Harvard Square that would be going up higher, we decided not to renew the lease and closed the location,” Liss-Riordan wrote. “We have enjoyed operating The Just Crust and greatly appreciate all the support the Cambridge community has given us over these past four years.”
Other local businesses have faced similar problems with high rents—assessed property values in Harvard Square have nearly doubled over the last five years.
Liss-Riordan, who is also a graduate of Harvard Law School, decided to open The Just Crust after she represented employees of the restaurant’s predecessor, Upper Crust Pizzeria, in a labor abuse case. When Upper Crust’s leases were auctioned off in late 2012, Liss-Riordan and her husband spearheaded a fundraising effort to purchase its Harvard Square location and open The Just Crust together in 2013.
The Just Crust was partially employee-owned, which Liss-Riordan said at the time was a change she wanted to make after being involved in Upper Crust’s legal battle. Her new restaurant’s name and logo—of an aproned worker—stood in “poetic juxtaposition” to the Upper Crust’s logo of a “dandy man in a top hat riding a bicycle,” according to The Just Crust’s website. The Just Crust also emphasized its “progressive business model” where employees received shares of the profits and ingredients were sourced from regional farmers and producers.
“It’s an exciting new way of supporting the workers we represent,” Liss-Riordan said at the restaurant’s opening. “I’m really hoping that we can make a success of it because I’m hoping this can serve as a model.”
Some Harvard students were sad to see the pizzeria go, citing its tasty thin crust pizza and sit-down atmosphere as a differentiating trait from other pizza shops in the Square.
Brandon N. Wachs ’18 said that he was surprised and disappointed to hear The Just Crust was closing, adding that he used to grab a slice from The Just Crust once every few weeks when walking from the Yard back to the Quad.
“I never thought that they were really threatened to close financially,” Wachs said. “But at the same time, Market’s left, the Liquiteria left, so obviously that street over there, at least that part of the Square, has been tough for business, and rents are probably pretty high.”
Sali E. Yi ’18 said The Just Crust was her favorite Square pizza shop. She added that it was “pretty embarrassing” how often she went—typically once a week. She appreciated that she could sit down and eat, whereas most other nearby pizza places were grab-and-go.
“I feel like each of the pizza places in the Square hits a different spot—Pinocchio’s I feel like everyone goes to after a late night or a really stressful time like reading period or something,” Yi said. “But when I’m looking for a really nice, high quality pizza that I can share with a friend, I definitely would go to Just Crust,” she added.

A group of professors from across the University is leading the search for a successor for James E. Ryan, the Dean of the Graduate School of Education.
Ryan announced earlier this year that he would depart the school after four years in the post to become the president of the University of Virginia. He joins University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Lizabeth A. Cohen, both of whom will also step down at the end of the academic year.
Faust named the Education School search committee members, a “group of faculty from within the Ed School and from related Faculties,” in an email to the school’s affiliates on October 11. The committee, whose members hail from a wide range of Harvard’s twelve schools, will work with Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 as an advisory group for the search.
In the email, Faust said that she would be soliciting advice through a designated email address from the Education School community for multiple aspects of the search.
“I would welcome your thoughts on the School’s major opportunities and challenges in the years ahead. In addition, I would be grateful for observations on the key qualities to seek in the School’s next dean, as well as nominations of individuals—both from within and beyond Harvard—whom we might consider,” Faust said.
She also thanked Ryan for his tenure.
“I am grateful to Jim for his four years of inspired leadership during a period of expansion and transformation in the School’s history, as well as for the efforts he will make during the balance of this year,” she said.
The search committee’s full composition is as follows: Kennedy School professor Christopher Avery; Law School and History professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin; Graduate School of Education School and Kennedy School professor David J. Deming; GSE professor Roberto Gonzales; GSE professor Monica C. Higgins; GSE professor Nancy Hill; GSE School professor Andrew D. Ho; GSE professor Deborah Jewell-Sherman; HKS School and Business School professor Herman B. “Dutch” Leonard; GSE School professor and Academic Dean Nonie K. Lesaux; Medical School, GSE, and School of Public Health professor Charles A. Nelson; GSE senior lecturer Mandy Savitz-Romer; Sociology professor Mario L. Small; and HBS professor Michael Tushman.
Members of the search committee declined to comment.

Sociology professor Michèle Lamont traveled to the Netherlands on Nov. 28 to receive the 2017 Erasmus Prize, one of the world’s top awards recognizing work in the humanities and social sciences.
The Erasmus Prize, named for Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, is awarded annually to an individual who has “made an exceptional contribution to the humanities or the arts, in Europe and beyond.” It consists of a $159,000 cash award.
The prize’s foundation cited Lamont’s “devoted contribution to social science research into the relationship between knowledge, power and diversity.” Lamont’s research at Harvard focuses on stigmatized groups and the cultural conditions of inequality, as well as ways that these groups can gain more respect in societies.
At the award ceremony, Lamont—who also directs the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs—met with members of the Dutch royal family, and said that the king and queen were “incredibly kind.” Queen Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti took a “particular interest in my work,” Lamont said, because of their shared interest in ending global poverty.
Lamont said she was allowed to invite 200 individuals to the award ceremony and 40 to the dinner afterwards, helping to make the event a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
According to Lamont, the ideas raised by her scholarship are gaining increasing importance because of today’s political climate. Recently, Lamont has published articles on the social and cultural implications of Donald Trump’s presidency, including works examining his rhetorical appeals to the white working class and criticisms of football players who knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality.
In her 2000 book “The Dignity of Working Men,” Lamont investigated the mindsets and morals held by members of the working class in the United States and France, arguing that policymakers are increasingly ignoring the concerns of these workers.
This spring, Lamont will teach the undergraduate class Sociology 24: “Introduction to Social Inequality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Graduate Student Council overwhelmingly voted to pass a resolution Wednesday urging the University to stop litigating a federal decision invalidating Harvard’s student unionization election last year.
The resolution asks Harvard to drop an appeal to the National Labor Relations Board that argues that there should not be another election to determine whether or not eligible students may unionize. Seventy-five percent of Graduate Student Council representatives voted in favor of the resolution at the body’s Wednesday night meeting, which required a two-thirds majority to pass.
Harvard’s appeal is the latest development in a year-long legal battle between union organizers and the University.  After the November 2016 unionization election, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers filed an objection to the NLRB, arguing that Harvard’s own voter list was inadequate and could have affected the outcome of the vote. In July, the NLRB’s regional director called for a second election. 
Harvard filed its appeal weeks later.
GSC’s resolution—which is almost identical to legislation passed by the College’s Undergraduate Council in November— argued Harvard is trying to change labor law with its appeal and that a Harvard victory on this case could weaken labor rights nationwide.
“The legal reasoning of Harvard’s appeal would substantially weaken employers’ requirement to provide complete and accurate voter lists in workplaces around the country,” the resolution reads.
Harvard’s attorneys have argued that the University reasonably complied with the voter list requirement and that voters were generally well informed about the election.
“The University’s goal was always to include all eligible voters on the list.  A University team worked diligently to create the most accurate list possible despite challenging conditions,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in a recent email to students.
Although most GSC members voted for the resolution, it still prompted heated debate.
In a packed Dudley House room, history graduate student John Gee—who presented the resolution—said he thought Harvard should give graduate students the opportunity to determine the fate of student unionization by calling for a re-vote.
“Wouldn’t it be better if the rights of Harvard students to unionize were decided by Harvard graduate students,” Gee said. “This resolution does not signal substantive approval or disapproval of having a union. It’s about the election.”
Engineering School representative Kevin Tian said he was concerned, however, that the resolution might misrepresent the diverse opinions of Harvard’s graduate students.
“My question is why should the GSC be taking on this kind of a resolution when it’s pretty damn clear that there is not even a significant majority of students that agree that there should be a union,” said Tian. “This is not a point that there is no contest, but the fact is that the GSC should be representing all students equally.”
It is unclear whether the federal NLRB will take Harvard’s case and, if so, when it will release a ruling.

UPDATED: December 8, 2017 at 4:30 p.m.
Every November, Harvard students don their crimson apparel and flock to the Harvard-Yale football game, packing bleachers shoulder to shoulder.
Harvard-Yale is no two-hour affair; preparations for the Game begin a week in advance with College-sponsored student events leading up to the much-anticipated game. On game day, students rise early and crowd together at tailgates and in the stands, forming a sea of crimson.
The bleachers at other sporting events, however, are often sparsely populated.
While Harvard boasts more varsity teams than any other Division I program in the country, with 42 teams in total, the College falls short in school spirit when it comes to athletics, according to some athletes, coaches, and departmental administrators.
“It’s not necessarily the cool thing to do, to go support a sports team and be in the students’ section,” said Robert W. Feinberg ’19, a member of the varsity men’s basketball team.
Student-athletes and Athletics administrators identify a lack of awareness, physical distance, and the challenge of competing with other extracurricular activities and academics for Harvard students’ time as main barriers to attendance.
The Athletics Department has tried to overcome these obstacles with the introduction of a rewards program and the recent launch of a new student-athlete marketing initiative this fall. For some lucky superfans, regular attendance at Harvard sporting events reaps material rewards, ranging from airline tickets to iPad minis.
According to Associate Director of Athletics for Marketing and Sales Susan Byrne, attendance at sporting events has declined across the board within the NCAA. While Byrne said the department is interested in game attendance and tracks the number of students at ticketed events, she declined to provide statistical data beyond the attendance figures at four specific games this semester.
Byrne said a general absence of a large sports culture on campus could be among a number of factors affecting game attendance.
“There’s a lot of House spirit at Harvard but not necessarily Harvard school spirit,” Byrne said.
Students like Feinberg and S. Cindy Zeufack ’20 also point to less school spirit among Harvard undergraduates as limiting factors.
“I tour guide for the admissions office and one of the people was asking me for school spirit here at Harvard,” Zeufack said. “For me, personally, it’s lacking a little bit in sports.”
Publicizing games to students and providing accurate information about ticketing costs have also been problems, according to Byrne, who said many students are unaware that they can attend ticketed games—football and men’s and women’s basketball, ice hockey, and lacrosse—for free.
Still, emails from the Athletics Department that advertise weekly events include a link to “buy tickets” under each event. Additionally, the upcoming games featured on the Athletics Ticket Office website do not inform students that they can attend for free.
Byrne said the Charles River also serves as a “great divide” between Harvard’s students and its sporting events, most of which take place on the side of the river opposite student housing. While students living in River Houses are around a 10-15 minute walk away from Harvard Stadium and Blodgett Pool, according to Google Maps, those living in Pforzheimer, Currier, and Cabot Houses must walk for nearly half an hour to reach these facilities.
“It’s maybe a two-thirds of a mile walk for most Harvard dorms,” said Feinberg. “And our games are played in the winter so it’s very cold. And that just kind of discourages some people from even wanting to cross the bridge and go all the way down there.”
Sports teams like polo, whose home matches are typically 25 to 30 miles away from campus, find it even more difficult to get students to attend.
“It’s hard for players to get down for practice,” said Crocker Snow Jr., the head coach for the polo team. “It’s equally hard for friends and family that want to see them play.”
Peter Brand, the head coach for men’s and women’s fencing, said students’ unfamiliarity with a sport and its rules can also prevent them from attending events.
“It’s complicated, and that’s why you don’t get a huge amount of interest as far as spectators are concerned,” he said.
Time is another factor that plays into game attendance, often serving as the biggest obstacle for students.
A. Casey Carter ’20 said it is hard for students to keep time open to attend games; he said he himself usually only goes when they “revolve around social events.” Extracurricular commitments also keep students from attending games, according to Ashri Anurudan ’19.
With nearly 500 officially recognized student organizations on campus, Harvard students’ time and attention is in high demand.
“Clearly, the academic road and the number of activities that are not sports—recreational clubs and things—is way higher than when I went to college,” Snow said.
Over the last few years the Athletics Department has developed two major initiatives to increase attendance at sporting events.
In 2014, it launched the CrimZone Rewards app, which allows students to earn points for checking into athletic events. Students can later redeem their points for prizes such as clothing, gift cards, and electronics.
Many colleges offer a similar rewards program, said Byrne, but Harvard “put a different spin on it” by offering students extra incentives at so-called “featured” events. Ticketed sports typically have two featured games per season, while all others have one.
While most athletic events are worth 10-15 points each, students can earn up to 50 points at a featured event if they stay at least halfway, according to the app. These games typically also offer free food or giveaway items like burritos or t-shirts and are heavily promoted by athletes. Since the app’s launch three years ago, there have been nearly 33,000 check-ins to featured events, according to Byrne.
For their featured game against Penn in September, the varsity women’s field hockey team hosted a “Brunch at Berylson” event at the field where they offered free food and bucket hats to students who attended. Similarly, the varsity women’s volleyball team distributed complimentary water bottles to attendees at their featured game in October.
This semester, students could exchange the points they earned for prizes ranging from a Harvard frisbee—redeemable at 250 points—to Ray Ban sunglasses worth 1,200 points. For 100 points each, CrimZone users could also buy raffle tickets to enter to win one of the app’s Grand Prizes: gift cards to Southwest Airlines and REI and an iPad Mini, each valued at hundreds of dollars.
For Julia M. Baumel ’18, a member of the women’s lightweight crew team, the opportunity to compete with a friend for the most points motivated her to attend many sporting events throughout her sophomore fall. Earning more than 1,000 points for attendance, Baumel received $400 in Southwest Airlines credit and a pair of Beats headphones.
Michael B. Alber ’21 was one of the 50 users featured on the CrimZone Rewards app’s leaderboard this semester. Finishing the semester at 19th place with 395 points, Alber said he accrued them attending a variety of sports games and chose to redeem them for raffle tickets.
A member of the men’s cross country and track teams, Alber said he had a “head start” in downloading the app and accumulating points because his teammates told him about it in the beginning of the year. He said he’s used the app to check into 12 games this semester.
“I generally like going to events and cheering on the team and the spirit aspect of it, and the rewards are also an extra incentive,” Alber said.
Other students are less enthusiastic about—or simply not aware of—the chance to earn the app’s prizes. Carter said he has only used the app once, to receive a free t-shirt. Justin Zhu ’21 said he’s been to a football game, but he has never heard of the app.
Bradley C. Fusco ’19, a member of the varsity women’s hockey team, said that she thinks the app has been effective, but that its use is not necessarily widespread among the general student body.
“A lot of people that are using that app are other athletes supporting other athletes,” Fusco said. “And I think that one big thing that could help attendance all-around is if we had non-athletes supporting the teams as well.”
Regardless, coaches and athletes said they believe the app has been successful in driving up student attendance at games.
“I know that our department tries to correlate the rewards program with the matches that are most important, our big matches,” said Traci L. Green, head coach of the varsity women’s tennis team. “So for us that’s been effective. We have a larger amount of folks coming out to support our matches when we do have the CrimZone Rewards program.”
This fall, the Athletics marketing department has undertaken another initiative to increase student attendance through the creation of the Chief Marketing Officers program, in which athletes from each team serve as liaisons between the department and the general student body.
As CMOs for their teams, athletes suggest prizes that CrimZone Rewards users can redeem for points, brainstorm ideas for featured events, and plug events to their classmates in person and online.
“I bring the ideas that my team has about featured games, giveaways, etc. to marketing and I’m in contact with them about what we can do to get more fans, get more activity on social media,” said Fusco, who serves as the CMO for the women’s ice hockey team. “I administer schedules for my teammates to hand out and post across campus to get people knowing when our schedule is.”
While coaches say the program is still in its development phase, Byrne said some CMOs have already made strides in increasing attendance at their events.
 
Byrne said Fusco was the brains behind the team’s “Light the Bright-Landry” game against Princeton this month. In addition to earning bonus CrimZone Rewards points at this featured event, student attendees were able to receive free t-shirts and glow sticks, enjoy complimentary pulled pork and macaroni and cheese, and spin a carnival wheel for additional prizes.
Feinberg, who is the CMO for the men’s basketball team, decided to designate a student section leader at his games. He said the chosen student, a freshman who is friends with members of the team, has already been in touch with the Athletics Department and is in charge of publicizing games, leading chants, and engaging spectators.
“Sometimes it’s not as much the amount of people we have,” Feinberg said. “If you have a loud, supportive group of even just 30 people it can make a difference.”
Athletics administrators, coaches, and athletes are optimistic that the rewards program and the new marketing initiative can foster more support among undergraduates and better spotlight the College’s nearly 1,200 student-athletes.
“They want the notoriety and they deserve it,” said Brand. “We have Olympians here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After doubling in size last year, the Diversity Peer Educators expanded on-campus programming and outreach this semester with increased events and collaborations with other student groups.
The Diversity Peer Educators—a group of trained student facilitators that conduct outreach for the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion—grew in size from ten to 20 staff members in the program’s second year.
Now in its third year, the group hosted a series of on-campus dialogues and started developing trainings for Peer Advising Fellows.
 Ileana Casellas-Katz, an administrative fellow at the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, said she worked with the expanded Diversity Peer Educators to curate events that are more accessible to students. Casellas-Katz said the Diversity Peer Educators previously hosted a multi-week  “set of sustained dialogue” events on a specific topic. This year, she added, the group changed their model to host six different events, each on a different topic.
“We recognized that we wanted to be able to hit on more subjects, more topics within the course of the semester,” Casellas-Katz said.
This semester’s dialogues have focused on free speech, mental health, and identity and intimacy at the College, often in collaboration with other on-campus groups such as Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, Harvard Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators, and the Student Mental Health Liaisons.
Michelle Liang ’19, a Diversity Peer Educator who facilitated an Oct. 30 dialogue titled “Free Speech? Free Society?,” said that the more “intimate” setting of the events made for more meaningful discussion.
“There’s debate rooms, there’s political spaces, but there’s not really a dialogue space where people can come from the ‘I perspective,’ where people can come from telling a personal experience they’ve had,” Liang said.
The Diversity Peer Educators have further expanded their work by collaborating with the Peer Advising Fellows program, which looks to help freshmen students navigate Harvard, according to Brooks Lambert-Sluder, who directs the PAF program.
According to Lambert-Sluder, the Diversity Peer Educators attended monthly Yard meetings for the PAFs last month to discuss issues related to the first-year experience and begin planning optional training sessions for PAFs in the spring. Liang describe the meeting as an “info session” about the Diversity Peer Educators.
“I know that one of the things that came out of the Yard meetings was that it’s often challenging to advise across difference and to be a mentor to people whose experiences and backgrounds and identities may not be the same as yours,” Lambert-Sluder said. “So I hope that we can work with the DPEs and others to work on programming and training that will give PAFs more ability.”
Liang said that, while the Diversity Peer Educators have not finalized their plans for next semester’s PAF trainings, some PAFs have weighed in on suggestions to create an effective training program.
Lambert-Sluder said it is likely the Diversity Peer Educators will hold two training sessions for the PAFs in the spring.

When high school junior Annamira O’Toole was in fourth grade, she said she grew tired of “learning long division for the fourteenth time.”
She said she vividly remembers the time she and her friend approached their teacher and said they didn’t want to do the regular lessons in the class. Instead, O’Toole struck a deal with the teacher to sit in the corner of the classroom and complete more advanced pre-algebra worksheets in place of the routine curriculum.
“She would give us worksheets, like pre-algebra worksheets, and we would just sit in the corner, laughing and doing math,” O’Toole said.
O’Toole now attends Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school in Cambridge. Each year, several CRLS students find they have exhausted the school’s already extensive math curriculum. As a result, this year alone, 13 of these students find themselves walking a few blocks west to attend math classes at Harvard, and, in rare cases, starting as early as in their freshman year.
While younger than the average Harvard math student, these high schoolers say they are able to tackle college math, despite a few challenges, and that taking classes at the College has positively affected their perception of Harvard.
CRLS has an expansive math program spanning from Algebra I to AP Calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP Statistics, so the students that choose to pursue the challenge of taking math classes at Harvard typically have strong math backgrounds that allow them to accelerate through the high school’s programming.
Jeff Gaglione, the Dean of Mathematics Curriculum and Program at CRLS, said that  students allowed to take classes at Harvard have often completed the high school's curriculum. 
“We’re typically looking for students to exhaust our course offerings before taking Harvard classes, and it’s great that we have Harvard right near us,” Gaglione said.
In particular, once the students complete the calculus offered at CRLS, many of them seek out the opportunity to take multivariable calculus at Harvard.
“I was done with calculus by the end of sophomore year, and then it was like, I either don’t do math for two years or I come here,” Paloma J. O’Connor ’21, who graduated from CRLS in 2016, said.
O’Toole said that due to the advanced mathematical coursework that she did throughout middle school, she was able to begin taking Harvard math classes her freshman year; most CRLS students that take math at Harvard begin later.
“I’ve been taking Harvard extension math classes since middle school, but the first Harvard undergraduate class I took was Math 101: 'Sets, Groups and Topology.' That was freshman year of high school,” O’Toole said.
Now a self-proclaimed part-time junior at CRLS and part-time homeschooled student, O’Toole has continued taking Harvard math classes.
“Sophomore year of high school I took 21a and 21b so that’s multi and linear algebra, and then this year, I’m taking Math 122, which is Abstract Algebra, basically,” she said.
While the difficulty of taking Harvard math classes may seem as though it would serve as deterrent to some students, Gaglione said that when students from CRLS take classes at Harvard, those classes are not factored into their GPA.
Nevertheless, Harvard College classes that are taken during the school day still appear on students’ transcripts, and CRLS does award students credit for taking them.
“We will put Harvard classes on students’ transcripts, but we do require that we get some kind of grade notification from Harvard itself,” Gaglione said.
He said that professors at the College will typically write a letter to acknowledge that the CRLS student was in their class and assign them a final grade.
CRLS students that take math classes at Harvard say they are faced with the challenges of adjusting to a college classroom environment long before their peers.
For example, CRLS senior Jeffrey Chen, who is currently enrolled in Math 101, said that students are often responsible for emailing the Harvard professor and asking for permission to take his or her class.
“You have to take the initiative yourself to go ask a professor, and that first time is always like, you don’t know what’s going to happen,” he said.
O’Toole said that it can be difficult for CRLS students to learn to advocate for themselves, but professors are often willing to include them in their class.
“Usually when somebody asks, I say yes. Often it’s been the case that other professors send me information and say that ‘I spoke to so and so, is it okay if he or she takes your class?’ And I say sure,” Hiro L. Tanaka, who teaches Algebra 1: “Theory of Groups and Vector Spaces”, said.
Once a student has been accepted into a class, they face another hurdle: learning alongside students that are several years older than they are.
“It’s really intimidating. Especially because when I go to section and stuff, people don’t always know that I’m a high schooler, so they’ll be asking asking me questions about my dorm and things like that, and I have to tell them that I’m in high school, and it’s like a big thing,” Dina Voevodsky, a senior at CRLS, said.
O’Toole agreed, saying that she sometimes feels uncomfortable asking questions in her class.
However, despite these difficulties, multiple CRLS students said that they have been able to develop collaborative relationships with their classmates, professors, and teaching fellows.
For example, Voevodsky said that this year, she has began attending “Math Night,”  collaborative office hours with teaching fellows where students work on problem sets together.
O’Toole said that while she often works on homework with other students from CRLS, she also does problem sets with Harvard students.
“I like wait outside the door of Leverett Hall to be swiped in by somebody else, and then I sneak in and go to Math Night,” she said.
While Tanaka said that he does not feel the need to provide any special help to high school students in his classes, he did note the differences in their age, and consequently, the number of years they have been doing math.
“You do have to be sensitive about the mathematical maturity that they have. For some reason, I think when we’re 20 and have done math for a long time, some people think a different way from when they are say, 16, so you do have to keep that in mind,” Tanaka said.
While these high schoolers have already gotten to know the ins and outs of the Science Center, all of the current CRLS students interviewed said they don’t want their Harvard education to end in high school. Chen, O’Toole, and Voevodsky are all applying to the College this year.
“It’s kind of better than a college tour. You’re actually in the class. You’re actually experiencing the people there. People are generally welcoming and understanding of your situation and that’s really nice,” Chen said.
Voevodsky said that the sense of community she gained from taking Harvard classes factored into her decision to apply.
“I really like the collaborative environment and the professors. I like all the students, and I’m definitely applying to Harvard, so I mean we’ll see, but I think it’s positively influenced me,” she said.
While Voevodsky and Chen both said that they were considering studying math in college, O’Toole said that while Harvard classes have facilitated her love of math, she is also drawn to other disciplines.
“I’m not sure that I would be able to spend my career just thinking about pure math, even though it is fun, and I enjoy it as a part of my education,” O’Toole said.
For O’Connor, who already attends Harvard, she noted that taking Harvard classes prior to applying helped assuage her fears about the seeming impossibility of achieving success in a Harvard class.
“It definitely gave me the impression that I wasn’t wildly out of my depth, so it wasn’t impossible that I could come to Harvard, and it wouldn’t be like I would have no idea what’s going on in every class,” O’Connor said.

The Kennedy School of Government last week completed $126 million in renovations to its campus, marking the occasion with a ribbon cutting ceremony and speeches from top administrators.
The construction project, underway since late 2015, included several new buildings added to the center of campus.
The finished additions total about 91,000 square feet of classroom, office, and common spaces. Some of the new features of the Kennedy School campus include a revamped dining area and an elevated outdoor courtyard. Foreign dignitaries who visit the school may be safely transported underneath the elevated courtyard, according to preliminary release plans.
The Kennedy School’s recent capital campaign, which has raised at least $580 million, covered the construction costs. The campaign in 2016 surpassed its original goal of $500 million, the bulk of which came from non-alumni donors and outside sources including former Mayor of New York Michael R. Bloomberg.
University President Drew G. Faust delivered remarks at the ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the end of construction last week.
“We’re here to mark a new era for a school that champions reasoned debate and informed governing,” she said. “The Harvard Kennedy School will continue to advance this important mission in this new and glorious space, a space that is going to enable learning, enhanced community, and enhanced vigorous and rigorous debate.”
Former Kennedy School dean David T. Ellwood and current dean Douglas W. Elmendorf were also in attendance. They said the new space will help grow the Kennedy School and  that funds from the Kennedy School capital campaign will help fund other projects.
“We have gone from being a series of buildings to being a campus,” Ellwood said at the event.
“This moment is going to be a transformative one for the Kennedy School,” Elmendorf said. “Soon we will be concluding the most ambitious fundraising campaign in the school’s history, a campaign that was launched and led for a number years by David Ellwood and has raised crucial resources to build a new campus, provide financial aid for students who could not be here otherwise.”
“Our buildings are the structural framework for our lives here, and we are so fortunate that our buildings are beautiful as well as practical,” Elmendorf added.

UPDATED: December 19, 2017 at 9:25 p.m.
Stephen E. Coit ’71 won’t tell you which of the over two dozen portraits he’s painted for Harvard is his favorite.
“I would never answer that because my paintings are like my children,” he said.
Coit, a 69-year-old venture capitalist and entrepreneur, serves as the official Harvard Foundation Portraiture Artist. In 2003, the Foundation’s Portraiture Committee commissioned him to paint portraits of prominent University affiliates of African American, Asian American, Latino American, and Native American descent who have served Harvard in some capacity for at least 25 years.
But Coit also paints portraits for other Harvard groups including the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study. To date, he has daubed 27 pictures of a wide range of individuals spanning University administrators, famous alumni, and prominent government staffers.
Coit has painted figures like University President Drew G. Faust, former Treasurer of the United States Rosa G. Rios ’87, and longtime College admissions officer David L. Evans.
Coit and Foundation officials say his paintings have caused Harvard’s expansive portrait collection—comprising more than 750 oil portraits, according to a 2002 inventory—to more accurately reflect the school’s diversity. But Coit said his portraits may be under threat as Harvard’s 12 residential Houses—where many of his pictures hang—undergo renovations. Further complicating the pictures’ future, the Foundation is navigating a transitional period after former director S. Allen Counter died in July 2017, leaving the organization leaderless.
Coit said he takes the danger posed to his portraits personally—he treats his paintings like people and thinks of them as friends.
“I try to make sure they have good homes and I visit them. I visit them because I live with these paintings in my studio for months,” Coit said. “I remember when [the painting of Sociology Professor] Orlando Patterson left my studio, I missed him.”
Coit said he often researches the subject of a painting for months before setting brush to canvas. An intense focus on a subject’s personal life and character is an important part of the process, Coit said. For example, his portrait of Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, the first Native American to graduate from the College, took nine months of research.
Coit’s painting of Cheeshahteaumuck hangs in Annenberg Hall, the freshman dining hall.
Sandra Naddaff, the chair of the Foundation’s portraiture project, called the amount of time Coit spends researching his subjects “quite wonderful.” 
“That understanding of the people he is painting and what they contributed to the College are...things that he comes to understand on a very deep level and then is able to embed in the portrait itself,” Naddaff said.
Coit said he believes intense engagement with a subject is necessary for his compositions.
“Having the ability to have a conversation with a painting, to me, is part of my artistic mission,” Coit said.
He said he hopes students who encounter his work will take part in this conversation. Coit’s paintings are currently displayed in several locations on campus including various Houses, dining halls, administrative and academic buildings, and libraries.
Coit said he first seriously tried painting—not counting the watercolors he produced in high school—when he decided to take a sabbatical from venture capital in 1992. Soon after, he  “caught a bug” and decided to leave his position to begin painting full time, he said.
He started taking night art classes and traveling to Italy to attend graduate oil painting courses.  Coit said he sought to perfect his technique by drawing at every possible moment.
“When I thought I could see my way financially—not some grand one percent piece of the pie, but enough to be a responsible husband and parent—I approached my venture capital fund and said, ‘I can’t be this,’” Coit said.
He officially stepped away from venture capital in 1996, and said he has never looked back. Today, in addition to takings commissions, he occasionally teaches painting courses at Lowell House. Carol A. “Kitty” Pechet, an artist who participated in one of Coit’s classes, said she admires Coit’s process and the details he includes in his work.
“He seems to be able to put the character of somebody into vision. That’s not so easy,” Pechet said. “He has a dimensional understanding of them. That’s why the paintings aren’t empty or flat.”
When Coit, who is white, was being interviewed for the position of official portraitist for the Foundation, he said Foundation committee members like Reverend Peter J. Gomes quizzed him about his ability to represent people of color faithfully.
“I said that there are no two people that have the same color skin and that achieving the proper color of skin to me is easier than painting the color of pink granite in Maine in the morning fog,” Coit said.
Coit said he believes every person, situation, and lighting setup is different. He added “acute observation” is critical, especially when seeking to represent people from diverse racial backgrounds. Harvard students and officials say diversity at the College is increasing—and claim Coit’s portraits are more critical now than ever.
Lowell House Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck, who said she has worked at Harvard since the 1970s, said she thinks the College has made great progress on increasing diversity. According to The Crimson’s survey of the incoming class of 2021, the class is majority female and boasts a significant increase in the number of students of color from previous years.
“Now we have all of this diversity and it’s an enriching thing for Harvard College,” Eck said. “It’s important for our education, for our intellectual life and for our life with one another. Not to have that displayed in some meaningful way on our walls is a mistake.”
Coit painted Rios, former treasurer of the United States and the first Latina to have a portrait at Harvard, in 2015. Her portrait now hangs in the Junior Common Room at Winthrop House.
In an interview Thursday, Rios said Coit’s portraits are inspirational to undergraduates.
“I’m a big believer in this next generation of leadership having inspirations in order to have aspirations,” Rios said. “These types of opportunities to showcase and highlight examples of people who kind of walked through the fire, if you will, and took those strategic risks are important.”
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, an intern at the Harvard Foundation, said he sees similar value in displaying portraits of diverse figures at Harvard. He said he thinks what a prospective student likely saw on Harvard’s walls 20 years ago differs widely from what students see today.
“I think that those symbols actually make a difference and that can make a real impact on Harvard’s recruitment, on our bringing in the best and brightest talent and not having people be discouraged because they feel Harvard doesn’t value or represent their particular race or identity or gender,” Freeland said.
After the passing of former Foundation director Counter this summer, some say the organization’s portraiture project faces an uncertain future—particularly as Harvard seeks to overhaul and renew each of its 12 undergraduate Houses.
Coit said he is worried House renovations could mean his portraits will be moved to less visible locations, something he considers contrary to the mission of the project as a whole. Lowell House, home to at least two of his portraits, will remain under construction until the fall of 2019—and Adams House, which boasts at least one of his pictures, will begin undergoing renovations in June 2019.
Apart from concerns over portrait relocation, Coit said he thinks the newly remodeled Houses may not provide the appropriate aesthetic backdrop for his paintings.
“Just because it looks modern and sleek and it’s made of glass and you can see through it and it’s got a metal frame and the light is cool, doesn’t mean it’s teaching you anything about who went before you and what your job is here,” Coit said.
Naddaff, the chair of the portraiture project, acknowledged the importance of displaying the portraits in locations where they are visible to undergraduates. But she said other locations may be more valuable than the Houses. In particular, she mentioned hanging portraits in Annenberg, Lamont Library, and University Hall.
“I think, for most us, the Houses are where we think the students are, but certainly students are in many different buildings,” Naddaff said.
The project’s future may also be in doubt due to Counter’s passing, according to Florence C. Ladd, novelist and former director of Radcliffe’s now-dissolved Mary Ingraham Bunting Institute.
“Dr. Alan Counter was instrumental in heading the project. Now that he has passed away, I don’t know where the initiative to continue the work rests,” Ladd said.
Asked whether the group would continue its work despite Counter’s death, Naddaff said she believed it would.
“I have no reason to believe that it will not be sustained as a commitment,” she said.
Regardless of the portraiture project’s fate, Coit said he thinks the portraits he has already painted leave a legacy that will last for decades.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Young people in America are increasingly dissatisfied with President Donald Trump's administration and largely pessimistic about the future of the country, according to the fall 2017 edition of the Institute of Politics biannual youth poll.
The survey was organized by undergraduates from the Harvard Public Opinion Project and included survey results from over two thousand 18 to 29 year olds nationwide. Some of the key findings, which were released Tuesday, include data about young people’s hope for the future, opinions on President Donald Trump, political parties, and race.
Trump’s job approval rating fell down seven percentage points from the spring survey to 25 percent. Additionally, 67 percent of those surveyed said they were fearful of America’s future, while 31 percent said they felt hopeful about America’s future. Only 14 percent surveyed said that they believe America is generally headed in the right direction.
The survey also included questions about football players who kneel during the national anthem before games. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed approve of the decision to kneel during the anthem.
Of the many issues in the poll, opinions on the anthem were some of the most polarized. Eighty percent of Democrats approved, while 17 percent of Republicans approved of kneeling during the anthem.
Those surveyed also expressed mixed views about the performance of America’s political parties. While 65 percent of those surveyed preferred Democratic control of Congress, only 34 percent agreed that the Democratic party cared about people like them, and 21 percent said the same of the Republican party.
The survey also found that 79 percent of young people said they were concerned with the state of race relations today, while 68 percent of black Americans and 46 percent of Hispanics replied that they believed that “their race is under attack ‘a lot’ in America.” Fifteen percent of white respondents said they feel the same way.
John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, said he believes that the dissatisfaction expressed in the survey threatens the current political status quo.
“The fear that is present in this poll could fuel the upending of the Washington establishment as we know it,” Della Volpe said.
Della Volpe noted that in the 2018 midterm elections, millennials have the potential to outnumber the baby boomers and become the largest voting generation, if they make it to the polls.
“Millennials are now the largest generation in the electorate. This poll and the Virginia election show that they are becoming more motivated—and I believe the fear that exists today about our future will soon be turned into the fuel that will reform our government,” Della Volpe said.
“The only question is whether this comes from inside or outside the traditional party structure,” he added.
Della Volpe was optimistic that young people will turn out to vote in higher numbers in the midterm elections.
“There’s evidence here that in the last year—in nearly every way you can measure it—that there’s been a greater motivation [in young people] around voting,” Della Volpe said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will aim to host tailgates for next year’s Harvard-Yale football showdown near Fenway Park to encourage attendance at the Game, according to Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise.
In an interview Thursday, Scalise said that while the potential renovations to Harvard Stadium that were cited as a reason for the move will not move ahead, Fenway is working with the College to explore nearby locations to host the pre-game festivities. He also said the Department is working with Fenway to coordinate transportation between the campus and the stadium downtown—some students had been worried about traveling between campus tailgates and the ballpark.
“They’re going to basically open up anything they can control and work with us to open up other venues that the city controls, and that includes streets, parking lots, and establishments nearby,” Scalise said. “So we’re going to get a full menu of those and make those available to people.”
Scalise said Harvard may still host tailgates on campus as a fallback, adding he believes tailgates closer to the park will encourage more fans to attend the Game.
“We could always bus people over and then back. Fenway has offered to help us with that,” he said. “But we think that it will be a better experience if it’s by Fenway so people actually go to the game. One of the issues that we always have, even at our tailgates here, is getting people out of the tailgates and into the game.”
Harvard first looked into moving the location of the Game two years ago after “exploratory work” revealed some infrastructure problems at the Harvard Stadium, according to Scalise. Over the years, cycles of freezing and expanding water have damaged some concrete and the metal rebar framing in the stadium.
“There’s no safety issue,” Scalise said. “What it is is the potential for damage over an extended period of time.”
At the time, the Department was unsure if the damage would require renovations that could affect the Game, so Scalise said they began looking into the logistics of hosting the Game elsewhere as a backup option. Scalise said Harvard considered both Gillette Stadium—home of the New England Patriots football team—and the historic Fenway Park,  which is home to the Boston Red Sox.
But the Department is not currently planning to go through with the renovations next year, according to Scalise.
“It started out as finding a new space for the Harvard-Yale game if we did major work on the stadium. It doesn’t look like we’re going to do major work on the stadium,” he said. “It still is a good thing to do, plus we had to make the contractual arrangements to actually play the game there.”
If the Department decides to undertake renovations, they will most likely happen incrementally over a number of years.
“What I am hearing is that the price tag to actually do what we all would want to do with the stadium will probably dictate a more annual approach to it rather than a big redo-the-stadium approach,” he said.
Athletics Department spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson said the Department is still working with Fenway to figure out ticket, seating, and other logistics. When asked what moving the Game to Fenway will cost, Scalise repeatedly said Fenway will keep Harvard “whole.”
“They’re going to keep us whole. That’s the arrangement, so Fenway is going to do what they can to keep us whole,” Scalise said. “It wasn’t a financial decision at all, this was an experience decision.”
Fenway previously hosted football games between Notre Dame and Boston College last year and more recently between Dartmouth and Brown this fall.
In addition to being the first Game played away from the Yale Bowl or Harvard Stadium since 1912, next year’s meeting of the Crimson and the Bulldogs will also be the 50th anniversary of the historic 1968 Game in which the teams tied 29-29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will finalize a plan to enforce its penalties on members of single-gender social groups by the start of next semester, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview Thursday.
Khurana’s statement comes three days after the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, formally voted to keep the sanctions unchanged for at least the next five years. That vote put an abrupt end to more than a year of tumultuous campus debate over the policy, which—starting with the current freshman class—bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and several prestigious fellowships.
Khurana said he is aware students—and particularly members of the Class of 2021, who arrived on campus this fall—may be confused about the policy and that he hopes to clear up the uncertainty as soon as possible.
“We ask people’s patience while we make sure that we send clear information and clear guidelines,” he said. “We can’t answer all questions right now. I apologize to the students who have those questions.”
Khurana said Thursday that, in crafting a plan for enforcement, he and other administrators will draw on reports issued by two previous College committees tasked with reviewing the penalties, as well as on a letter sent by University President Drew G. Faust and Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72. Faust and Lee sent the letter to Harvard affiliates Tuesday announcing the results of the Corporation’s vote.
Khurana said he will work with the Office of Student Life, the Office of Undergraduate Education, and “various College offices” over the next few weeks to develop a plan to enact the penalties.
Khurana said he will particularly look to recommendations issued by one of the two committees in March 2017. That report recommended that the College’s Honor Council help enforce the sanctions and that all-female groups receive a five-year grace period to go co-ed. It also suggested the College should consider barring members of single-gender clubs from leadership positions in both the Undergraduate Council and The Crimson as well as all other recognized student groups.
Khurana declined Thursday to say whether he planned to follow any of these recommendations. Instead, he said he plans to review these suggestions for their alignment with the “spirit of the policy.”
“Our goals are to get this information to the students as soon as possible,” Khurana said. “I expect that’s going to take us a few weeks, but we hope that by the time students come back for the spring semester, we will be able to answer many of their key questions.”
Khurana said he is unsure how he will communicate the exact details of administrators’ plan to implement the sanctions to students. But he vigorously denied the possibility of another report.
“No, no, no,” he said.
Across 19 months of debate over the College’s social group penalties, two different College committees produced three reports on the subject totaling more than 90 pages. The sanctions also sparked fierce debate in Cambridge.
At one point shortly after Faust announced the penalties in May 2016, hundreds of women took to Harvard Yard to protest the social group policy, chanting slogans like, “Hear Her, Harvard!”
Reflecting on the intervening months since Faust debuted the sanctions, Khurana—who has become the face of the policy on campus—said he thought he had learned at least one clear lesson.
“People shout their anger,” he said. “You have to be very empathetic, and recognize that often that anger is just passion from a particular point of view.”
“It’s really important to be hard on the problem and easy on each other,” Khurana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Coming off a statement win on Saturday against Princeton, Harvard women’s ice hockey looked to keep the momentum going as it traveled to Hanover, NH to face off against Dartmouth. Building off its strong defensive play from the weekend, the Crimson (7-4-1; 5-2-1 ECAC) shutout the Big Green (3-9-0; 1-7-0) 1-0. With the result, Harvard enters its winter break on a high note.
The last time Dartmouth and Harvard had met, Harvard was in control throughout all three periods with strong performances from several players. The underclassmen proved their worth, combining for eight points on the day and freshman forward Becca Gilmore leading the team with three points. The team was just as good on defense, killing six of the seven plays Dartmouth had. While the Crimson continued to work on growth and development over the next couple of months, so did the Big Green, so that this next meeting would be closer than the one in September.
The teams remained locked in a defensive stalemate for much of the match. For the Crimson, junior defender Kaitlin Tse’s play was crucial, as she accounted for 3 of 14 total blocks by Harvard’s blue line crew. In net, sophomore goalkeeper Beth Larcom continued her strong play, making 28 saves and earning her first shutout of the season. With her performance, Larcom raises her season save percentage to .912, placing her amongst the leaders in Division I play. Additionally, her 2.43 goals against average ranked 34th nationwide coming into play. Following today’s action, she is sure to see her spot rise on that leaderboard.
“Beth has had to play a big role this season so far with our two senior goalies graduating,” junior forward Bradley Fusco said. “She’s had a great attitude about it, and she’s gaining more confidence as the games continue on.”
Neither team was able to generate much success on the power play. Coming into the game, the power play has been a strength for the Crimson. Harvard’s offense ranked 15th in the nation, with an 18.2 percent power play conversion rate. The defense has also been strong, as it has killed 80 percent of opponent’s power plays. However, in today’s action, Harvard failed to score any of its three power play opportunities. Nonetheless, the defense played its part, preventing Dartmouth from convert on any of its five power play opportunities.
“Our attitude about that is to work hard, pressure them, and don’t give them the time or opportunities they want,” Fusco said. “We want to play smart and fast on power play opportunities.”
Following the second period, both team’s held roughly equal shot totals. In the third, however, Harvard’s offense began to show signs of life. The team outshot Dartmouth 13-7 in the frame, peppering the Big Green goalkeeper with a flurry of shots. Finally, with just 6:23 remaining in regulation, the team managed to break through Dartmouth’s defense for the score.
“Val always has a ton of energy on the ice and gets a ton of shots on net,” Larcom said. “She gets behind the back line and creates so many chances for us.”
On the play, senior defender Chelsea Ziadie played the puck off the board in the defensive zone. Sophomore forward Val Turgeon gathered the loose puck before taking off down the ice. Just as she crossed into the right circle, the Denver, Co. native fired her shot up and over the Dartmouth goalkeeper’s glove for the score. The goal adds to Turgeon’s strong play as of late, as she has accumulated 5 goals and an assist over the team’s past four games.
Following the goal, Harvard’s defense continued to stifle the Big Green attack. With Dartmouth unable to score, the game ended with a 1-0 score line. Following today’s result, Harvard closes out its fall semester of competition. The team will resume play on January 5 and 6, as it travels to upstate New York to face off against Rensselaer and Union.
“We have improved a lot from our first game,” Fusco said. “It’s also important that we haven’t lost an Ivy game yet this season. We do have some tough games coming up, so hopefully we’ll be ready for those. Overall, however, we have done well with a young roster and hope to build upon our success thus far.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite an ugly, low-scoring performance Wednesday night, the Harvard men’s basketball narrowly squirmed its way to victory, defeating Fordham 47-45 in The Bronx, N.Y.
The Crimson (4-6) sole lead of the contest came during the final seconds of play, when sophomore forward Seth Towns scored his only three of the contest to give Harvard a two-point lead. Rams senior guard Will Tavares quickly advanced the ball back to the Fordham side, but missed a corner jumper to conclude the game.
“That was not a pretty basketball game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said, “Both teams really struggled to score and shoot the ball. To be able to fight your way to a victory like that on the road is very hard and difficult. We had to make sensational plays late to finish it and win it.”
Although the game was largely unremarkable for both teams, the Rams (3-5) will likely reflect on this game as one that they let slip away. Holding a comfortable 12-point lead in the middle of the first half, Fordham was held to just five made field goals in the second frame by a improved Harvard defense.
“We have been in a few of these games and we haven’t found a way yet to win the close ones,” Fordham coach Jeff Neubauer said. “The only thing I asked for my team tonight, because I really respect Harvard, is I asked our guys to fight and defend for 40 minutes and we certainly did that...we certainly need to find a way to get over the hump.”
Following a 25-point outing coming off the bench against Kentucky, Towns again assumed the role as the team’s sixth man to start the game.
Amaker chose to start freshman Danilo Djuricic in place of Towns while freshman Rio Haskett earned his fourth career start in place of injured sophomore guard Justin Bassey. Sophomore forward Robert Baker was also out with an undisclosed injury.
Sloppy passing characterized the opening four minutes for the Crimson. Scoring just one basket, the Crimson had difficulty positioning itself within the Rams zone defense. Fordham was able to deflect numerous Harvard passes and started the contest with a 7-2 lead.
The Rams extended the lead to ten at 14-4 at the 12:42 mark. Unlike the solid three-point shooting Saturday afternoon against Kentucky, the Crimson could not earn itself a triple until the eleven-minute mark of the first half, starting the game 0-for-9 from three-point range.
Fordham would extend the lead to 12 in the first half despite no Rams player scoring more than seven points before intermission. Over half of Fordham’s 29 first half points came from triples, with five players each tallying a single basket from beyond the arc.
Harvard would bring the game back to a six-point margin with 2:37 remaining in the first half following a layup from sophomore forward Chris Lewis. Without an imposing  frontcourt defender, Fordham struggled throughout the game to contain Lewis, who scored all eight of his first half points through simple layup attempts at the rim.
Defense was a clear priority for the Crimson to start the second half. Fordham would not score a point for nearly four minutes to begin the frame. However, Harvard was unable to capitalize on the Ram’s inability to score, scoring just one basket in the first five minutes of play in the second half.
Trailing 33-27 with 12 minutes left to go in the half, the Crimson side sought some much-needed rejuvenation and Djuricic delivered in resounding fashion with a beautiful putback slam directly off of an Aiken three-point miss.
Harvard would continue to gnaw back from its deficit and by the six-minute mark was down by just two points. Towns, who finished with nine points and 11 rebounds, successfully maneuvered his way around three Rams defenders before finishing a tough layup to even the game at 37 with 6:10 to play.
Because Neubauer had consumed all but one of his timeouts at that point, the Rams were left on their own to regain some momentum. Two straight Harvard giveaways helped push  Fordham’s lead back to  five, but it was largely downhill from there for the Rams.
Down 45-42 with less than 30 seconds remaining, the Crimson patiently avoided taking a three. Aiken found himself trapped by three defenders on the left baseline, and instead of looking for a tough turnaround jumper, wisely located the open Djuricic underneath the basket.
After the freshman  finished the easy layup, Amaker called timeout to iron out his defensive formation. This ploy proved to be masterful, as Fordham was flat-footed on the ensuing inbounds play and gifted the Crimson the ball back after a five-second violation.
Despite missing all four of his prior three-point attempts, Towns was evidently Amaker’s go-to player in that situation and delivered big for the Crimson.
“I thought we had the fortitude to get the stops necessary late and without bailing them out with fouls,” Amaker said. “I was really pleased with the effort and smarts we had to show to win this game.”
