After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chapter of the all-female sorority Kappa Alpha Theta will become the gender-neutral social group “Theta Zeta Xi” and will disaffiliate from its national organization in the fall of 2018, the club announced Monday.
In a statement, club members tied the decision to go co-ed directly to the College’s social group penalties, writing they are acting “in good faith with Harvard’s social organization and nondiscrimination policies.” The College’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
“This decision reflects our commitment to supporting our members as they take full advantage of the academic and leadership opportunities available to them as Harvard students, which we believe is central to our mission,” the statement reads.
Theta members voted unanimously to go co-ed, according to the statement.
Theta Zeta Xi CEO Rena N. Simkowitz ’19, a Crimson sports editor, wrote in an email that she met regularly with officials in the Dean of Students Office over the past few months.
“The unanimous decision to transition our group is the culmination of many thoughtful conversations,” Simkowitz wrote. “It was not an easy decision to make; however, we are excited and optimistic about the future of our organization.”
Theta initially opposed going co-ed. After the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted to adopt the sanctions in Dec. 2017—ending years of debate and uncertainty—Theta released a defiant joint statement with sororities Alpha Phi and Delta Gamma announcing all three would continue to hold all-female recruitment in the spring of 2018.
Theta is the latest in a series of social groups to go co-ed. Most recently, Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma in Jan. 2018 became the gender-neutral group the Fleur-de-Lis. In the fall of 2017, all-male fraternities Kappa Sigma and Alpha Epsilon Phi voted to leave their national organizations and become co-ed organizations the KS and the Aleph, respectively. The Oak Club, the Sablière Society, the Seneca, and the Spee Club all relinquished their single-gender status over the past three years.
How the sanctions should apply to Harvard’s all-female social groups has long been a point of controversy. In March 2018, the College announced it would not pursue a proposed “bridge” program that would have allowed traditionally all-female social groups a longer period of time to go gender-neutral. Instead, Harvard dedicated resources and personnel—including the Harvard College Women’s Center—specifically to help women’s groups transition.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced a new framework for governing recognized social organizations in May. The framework details three tiers of recognition that social groups can apply for: “Interim Recognition,” “Full Recognition,” and “Full Recognition with Distinction.” Each tier comes with a different set of requirements and benefits granted by the College—and each ensures member groups are exempt from the sanctions.
Though in future years the group hopes to achieve “Full Recognition,” for the upcoming school year Theta Zeta Xi will pursue only “Interim Recognition” to ensure its recruitment process “best reflects our commitment to diversity, equity, and non-discrimination,” according to Simkowitz.
Theta Zeta Xi plans to hold its first recruitment in the spring semester, Simkowitz wrote in her email. She added the group will hold discussions with both students and College administrators throughout its transition.
“Our leadership looks forward to working closely with our current members, the Dean of Students Office and other like-minded groups to discuss how to best balance our commitment to uphold our group’s values and mission as a women’s focused organization without having a specific gender identity be a criterion for membership,” Simkowitz wrote.
Elizabeth A. Rinck, director of communications of the international Kappa Alpha Theta, wrote in an email the organization is disappointed by the College’s enforcement of the sanctions, but supports the Harvard chapter’s decision to break ties.
“While we are saddened by circumstances that forced our sisters to make an impossible choice, we support their desire to form an organization independent of Kappa Alpha Theta and recognized by Harvard University, giving current and future members the ability to participate fully in college life,” Rinck wrote.
In a statement provided by a spokesperson, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller wrote he welcomed students' efforts in helping build a "strong foundation of community values" including "inclusion" and "non-discrimination."
“We are grateful for our students’ hard work to transform their organizations into ones that advance these shared community values," he wrote. "We look forward to continuing to partner with them as we move forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Government and African and African American Studies Professor Claudine Gay will serve as the next Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Monday.
Gay, who currently serves as the FAS Dean of Social Science, will take office Aug. 15. Her appointment concludes a four-month search for a new FAS dean after current dean Michael D. Smith said in March that he planned to resign as soon as Bacow found his replacement.
Gay will be the first woman and the first person of color to hold the position since its inception in the early 1940s.
In deciding whether or not to take on the deanship—a decision Gay said she made “relatively recently”—Gay said she pondered what she could contribute to the role.
“I thought a lot about what the charge would be, whether or not I have something to give to it, and how I can grow,” Gay said in an interview Monday morning. “Once I answered those questions for myself, I was pretty excited to take on the responsibility.”
Gay received her B.A. in Economics from Stanford University before traveling across the country to earn her Ph.D. from Harvard’s Government department. She then returned to Stanford, working as an assistant professor and later a tenured associate professor in the school’s political science department—where she also served as the director of undergraduate studies—before coming to Harvard as a Professor of Government in 2006. She was appointed as a professor of African American Studies in 2008 and Smith chose her to serve as the Dean of Social Science in 2015.
The appointment of a new FAS dean marks one of the first major decisions of Bacow’s presidency, which officially began July 1. As FAS dean, Gay will oversee the University’s largest faculty and work closely with Bacow as she heads a school that the new president previously described as “the center of Harvard’s academic enterprise.”
In an announcement Monday, Bacow wrote that Gay is “an eminent political scientist, an admired teacher and mentor, and an experienced leader with a talent for collaboration and a passion for academic excellence.”
“She radiates a concern for others, and for how what we do here can help improve lives far beyond our walls. I am confident she will lead the FAS with the vitality and the values that characterize universities at their best,” he wrote.
Gay inherits a number of challenges including the ongoing project to renovate Harvard’s undergraduate Houses and the opening of a second campus in Allston in 2020. She will also face financial difficulties stemming from the University’s years of poor endowment returns—and she will confront a graduate student body that recently unionized for the first time in Harvard history.
Gay said she plans to spend her first few months as FAS dean having conversations with other parts of FAS. She said her priorities will likely emerge from those conversations.
“Ours is an incredibly diverse community and so without listening and learning, it's impossible for any agenda to take shape,” Gay said. “The one thing I can say for sure about my agenda will be is that whatever I choose to focus on, it's going to be informed by some basic value commitments that I have that have really shaped my work in the division—so commitments to transparency and equity and diversity.”
Gay previously served on FAS’s Committee on Appointments and Promotions, the FAS Committee on General Education, and as a Radcliffe Fellow. Earlier this year, she was a member of the 13-member faculty advisory group consulted during the presidential search that culminated in Bacow’s appointment. She is also the founding chair of Harvard’s Inequality in America Initiative, which seeks to bring together scholars from a variety of disciplines to study issues of inequality.
Gay said she plans to continue pursuing her work in the Initiative and that her new role will grant her a “new vantage point.”
“One of the priorities that I've had over the last year and a half for the division has been doing work to elevate the teaching and research that we do on equality,” Gay said. “For a lot of the work we've been doing on the initiative, the center of gravity has really been in the social sciences, and it'll be great to start looking more broadly at other parts of the FAS.”
Gay, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, will take on a role—like the University presidency— that has traditionally been held exclusively by white men. Following Bacow’s selection, some students said they were disappointed the presidency had not gone to a female candidate or candidate of color.
Bacow, along with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, began the FAS Dean search in March, days after Smith announced he would be stepping down after 11 years in the position. In the months since he formally launched the search, Bacow and Garber met with faculty and students to solicit input.
During the search, two groups wrote letters calling on Bacow to choose a dean who would prioritize the development of a formalized ethnic studies program. The first letter, penned by the Ethnic Studies Coalition, garnered the signatures of nearly 50 Harvard student and alumni organizations.
Gay said she is “optimistic” about this issue and has authorized faculty searches this past year in an effort to recruit more faculty to meet the demand from students.
“I think that there is a lot that we can do to address what remains an unmet need in this particular curricular area,” Gay said.
In the Monday announcement, Smith wrote his successor is an “inspired choice.”
“Claudine is a thoughtful academic leader who listens generously, delights in the intellectual diversity and energy of our community, and is driven by a deep commitment to our mission of teaching and research excellence and to this institution,” he wrote.
Bacow thanked both Smith for his 11 years in the role and the faculty members who advised his search. He wrote that he know Gay will benefit from “your warm welcome.”
“Thanks for helping both a new dean and a new president get acclimated to our new roles, at such a pivotal time for higher education,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The deserted and dilapidated Harvard Square Theater may soon house office space, several stores, and a new, two-screen theater — all concealed behind an LED-embedded facade capable of displaying art or photography.
Gerald Chan, the developer seeking to revive the Harvard Square Theater announced plans last month to tear down the deserted building to make way for storefronts, a new theater, and a four story-tall, LED-embedded edifice.
Billionaire Gerald L. Chan, the co-founder and leader of the investment firm Morningside Group, bought the property in 2015. The theater, located at 10 Church St., closed down in 2012.
In 2017, the Cambridge City Council gave Chan 30 days to draft initial plans for the site or risk losing ownership of the land. This past spring, the Council called on Chan to publicly release a timeline for his development project.
Chan proposed to construct a five-story building consisting of up to 60,000 sq. ft. and including offices, storefronts, and a two-screen theater.
Portuguese firm Promontorio Architects collaborated with Merge Architects in Boston to design the structure, which features a landscaped courtyard to bring in natural light.
"We are thrilled to be collaborating with Promontorio on the design of this important iconic building for Harvard Square,” Elizabeth Whittaker, Founder and Principal of Merge Architects wrote in an email, “Kirche is committed to developing a project that will bring back the vitality of the previous theater while providing a dynamic facade that will work well at the scale of Church Street."
Paulo Martins-Barata, a partner in Promontorio, wrote in an email that the the designs depict a “world-class” building with a “state-of-the-art” theater.
He stressed the building’s “innovative” art facade, a porcelain ceramic face with LED stripes which can light up to create various works of art or photography.
At the same time, Martins-Barata wrote the new building will “blend-in real fast.”
“This won’t definitively be a glass-box office building in the historically delicate context of Harvard Square,” he wrote. “Ideally, you’d think that this building was always there, even though it's entirely new.”
Jim Wooster, manager of local music club Passim, called the currently abandoned building an “eyesore.” He said he thinks most people in the community are “impressed” with the designs for the new complex.
“They’re not just trying to put up an office building and charge as much rent as they can,” Wooster said. “I think the developers are looking for ways they can be connected to the community, which I think is good and admirable.”
For example, Wooster said, opening retail storefronts nearby could be “a terrific way” to encourage people to explore the around and discover places.
At the same time, Wooster is “concerned” about disruptions to business from construction. He said he looks forward to discussing ways to mitigate disruptions with the developers.
“We’ve had good discussions with the developers already, and I know that they’re concerned about that and trying to make plans that would mitigate too much disruption for us,” he said. “I look forward to just keeping those lines of communication open so that if there are things that come up that we’ll be able to discuss them, and that they’ll be able to take our issues and concerns into consideration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the bustling Southern Chinese city of Wuxi, over 7,000 miles away from Cambridge, Mass., senior co-captain Eli Dershwitz became the No.1-ranked men's saber fencer in the world.
Wuxi, nestled alongside the picturesque Lake Tai in Jiangsu Province, was this year’s host of the World Fencing Championships. Numerous world-class fencers who had made the trip to Rio de Janeiro two years ago for the 2016 Olympic Games—including Dershwitz  himself—descended upon the 30,000-seat Wuxi Indoor Stadium for the most important global fencing competition in a non-Olympic year.
As the third-seeded competitor, Dershwitz commenced the tournament easily defeating Dmytro Pundyk (Ukraine), 15-4, before edging Yinghui Yan (China), 15-12, in the round of 32.
Dershwitz accomplished a challenging feat in the quarterfinal round, downing 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medalist Aron Szilagyi of Hungary, 15-11. Following another nerve-filled match in the semifinals against South Korean Kim Junho in which the Sherborn, Mass., native required three straight points to prolong the match and then surpass his opponent, 15-14, Dershwitz guaranteed himself the 2018 Overall World Cup title by making the final two.
In the championship match, the Harvard senior dueled against another five-ring podium holder, 2016 Olympic bronze medalist Junghwan Kim of South Korea. A tight match was decided in the final few points, when the South Korean pulled away to win 15-11 and earn the gold medal.
"To know that your name is going to be written down in the history books is amazing," Dershwitz said in an interview on gocrimson.com. "I lost a really close bout in the final to a great fencer, Kim—an Olympic Champion and World Champion now. And other people got bronze, great athletes, great fencers. It feels amazing to be on that podium with them."
Leaving Wuxi with the silver medal as part of a collection of three international gold medals and a bronze this year, Dershwitz propelled himself up the World Rankings to No. 1. The 22-year old is just the second American ever to ascend to the top of the world men's saber rankings, following in the footsteps of Brooklyn native Keeth Smart who accomplished the feat in 2003.
Following his return to the United States, Dershwitz will lead the Crimson for the second straight year as a co-captain. Junior Duncan Rheingans-Yoo was also selected as a men’s co-captain for the 2018-2019 season.
