After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, an intern from Harvard’s new Office of BGLTQ Student Life went to an Undergraduate Council meeting to take a picture of the group with a rainbow flag, part of a project demonstrating student groups’ support for National Coming Out Day. As she introduced herself with her name and preferred gender pronouns, she heard laughter from some members of the UC.
Unfortunately, the UC is not the only place on campus where someone introducing themselves with a preferred pronoun might be confronted with laughter. Yet for some people—especially trans people and people who do not identify themselves within a gender binary—asking one’s preferred pronouns and making an effort to refer to someone with those pronouns can be vitally important. In order for Harvard to be truly welcoming to trans people, we must respect people’s preferred pronouns. This will require, most off all, awareness and respect from the student body.
Despite generally best intentions, Harvard is still not as trans-friendly a school as we could be. An article on Advocate.com placed colleges like Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania on a list of  “The Top 10 Trans-Friendly Colleges and Universities” in the country, based on the Campus Pride Index. We would love to see Harvard on this list the next time it’s published.
Of course, there are important ways in which Harvard as an institution can make trans people feel more welcome on our campus. One of these is ensuring that every building with public bathrooms has at least some gender non-specific bathrooms. For example, all House Renewal projects should be sure to construct gender nonspecific bathrooms in House common spaces. Adding gender-neutral bathrooms to every Harvard building is an ongoing process that may take years—but it is essential so that people who don’t feel comfortable walking into a bathroom labeled “men” or “women” feel welcome and represented in all Harvard spaces, including classroom buildings, administrative buildings, dorms, and Houses.
Beyond bathrooms, universities like Harvard can respect their trans students by allowing students to register for programs without requiring them to choose one of two genders, and letting them easily change the name that appears on their diploma and other university documents through. Hopefully, the new director and staff of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life can advise the administration on how to make these and other important changes so that trans, genderqueer, and other students feel respected by the administration.
But, perhaps more important to the everyday experiences of trans students, school culture is one of the most important ways to make people feel either comfortable or marginalized. Much of the issue is people learning to respect those who don’t fit within the gender binary—and this will take a culture change for students, faculty, and administrators. While we expect that most students have good intentions, many of us have grown used to assuming the preferred pronouns and genders of those we meet. It will take deliberate thought and action by Harvard students and administrators to add “preferred gender pronoun” to the standard Harvard introduction—but that change will help make our campus a truly welcoming place to students of all gender identities.
Challenging our assumptions about gender can seem difficult, frustrating, and tedious. Yet this is a small price to pay for a campus culture that can truly be welcoming to students who may not feel comfortable identifying as “male” or “female.” Institutional change can only go so far to make Harvard a trans-friendly school. The most important changes must come from us.

I almost titled this column “Why I Refuse to Vote for Obama.” But the progressive case against Obama has been persuasively made again and again and there’s not really much I could add. So, instead, I’ve chosen to focus on the Green Party presidential candidate in this election, in hopes of informing fellow well-intentioned liberals and progressives in the Harvard community about her candidacy. So, who is Dr. Jill Stein ’73 and why are you likely not to know a thing about her?
Jill Stein, an alumna of Harvard College (1973) and Harvard Medical School (1979), is a physician specializing in internal medicine. She was a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in the 2002 and 2010 gubernatorial elections here. Unfortunately, she and her platform have been rendered virtually invisible in this election! This is primarily due to harsh ballot access laws and a corrupt debate system, both of which work to hide third-party candidates from the public eye.
In an interview with Russia Today, Dr. Stein addressed the difficulties third-party candidates face in terms of getting on the ballot in the first place, noting, “Each state has its own set of rules which are very demanding, very detailed and bureaucratic and require lots of signatures in order to get on the ballot.” Notwithstanding these obstacles, after dedicating most of its campaign time and resources to gathering signatures, the Green Party’s commendable efforts have ensured that Dr. Stein and her vice-presidential running mate, anti-poverty activist Cheri Honkala, will appear on 85 percent of the ballots cast on Election Day. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party has been even more successful at achieving ballot access through persistent litigation.
If 85 percent of Americans are able to vote for Stein, shouldn’t they at least be able to hear her speak at the presidential debates? If you watched the mainstream presidential and vice-presidential debates last month, you did not see either of these candidates in the mix.
In 1976, 1980, and 1984, the presidential debates were sponsored by a non-partisan group known as The League of Women Voters. In 1988, however, the group withdrew its sponsorship of the debates on the following day and issued a press release condemning the demands of the major candidates’ campaigns.
What exactly was the LWV condemning? The two major parties proposed creating the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates to sponsor the televised debates in 1988. The CPD remains the sponsor of the debates to this day. And, as activist and writer for opensecrets.org Harrison Wills points out, “the CPD’s history indicates that third-party candidates were looked on with disfavor from the beginning.”
The nonprofit and nonpartisan group Open Debates provides a helpful history of the CPD and explains its major problems. In an interview last month with DemocracyNow!, the founder and executive director of Open Debates, George Farah (HLS 2005) stated, “Over time, the candidates have made even greater efforts to control various components of the debates to eliminate both third-party candidates, unpredictable questions, and any threat to their dominance in our political process.”
How has Dr. Jill Stein been affected by all of this? Jia Hui Lee ’12 notes that “the arrest of Green Party presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Cheri Honkala outside the presidential debate venue….highlights serious questions about the influence of the [CPD] on the outcomes of election day.” Liberal and progressive voters should consider Dr. Stein’s campaign stances, which include bailing out massively indebted students rather than banks by forgiving student loan debt; support of civil liberties, a more progressive stand on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ issues than Obama; the implementation of universal health care; immediate action to address our serious climate problems; free public college education for all; and a Green New Deal to build a sustainable, green economy, by greatly reducing military spending, taxing Wall Street transactions and creating 25 million jobs. Unlike the major party candidates, Jill Stein would be solely beholden to the American people, not to Wall Street and major corporations. Dr. Stein has been endorsed by the well-known intellectual Noam Chomsky, prominent journalist and activist Chris Hedges, and others including black and Latino activists. Unfortunately, as Open Debates poignantly reminds us, “Excluded third-party candidates… can't break the bipartisan conspiracy of silence on issues where the major parties are at odds with most of the American people.”
Although Dr. Stein may have been excluded from the mainstream debates, organizations such as DemocracyNow!, the Independent Voter Network, and the Free and Equal Elections Foundation as well as news networks like Al Jazeera English and Russia Today have courageously expanded the coverage of the mainstream debates. Some have even hosted debates to which all candidates have been invited, including Obama and Romney (who have suspiciously declined to participate every time). In fact, Free and Equal will host its the next and final debate between Jill Stein and Gary Johnson on Monday night at nine. Obama supporters watching these debates may be surprised to realize that Jill Stein has really matched their beliefs best all along.

Every few months or so, fresh evidence corroborating that Fidel Castro is alive surfaces, fueling endless rumors about his health and supposedly imminent death. Only recently, the Cuban leader published a newspaper article ironically called “Fidel is Dying” to prove he’s still alive. He long ago ceased to be a relevant political actor on the international stage, yet he has passed into a higher pantheon—that of the legendary. He’s certainly one of the most important Latin American leaders of the past century, and were the communist regime in Cuba to die along with Castro, his name certainly would not.
The Cuban Revolution has had a lasting influence on Latin America. The Cuban regime in the present day has very little. From the triumph of the revolution to the present day, and especially since the end of the Cold War, the ability of the Cuban regime to influence events in the rest of the region has waned dramatically. Yet, illogically, United States policy towards the island has barely changed. By continuing to impose an economic embargo in an attempt to isolate Cuba, the United States does nothing to further its long-term goals and causes only harm.
The embargo against Cuba has acute humanitarian repercussions that seriously erode the United States’ moral standing in Latin America. The Cuban government has complained before the United Nations that it is unable to complete purchases of equipment for treating cancer in children, since the prostheses it requires are sold largely by U.S. companies. The availability of antibiotics for infants on the islands has likewise been jeopardized. These are not one-sided, propagandistic protests: the United Nations Children’s Fund agrees that the embargo has resulted in limited cancer treatment options in Cuba.
Proponents of the embargo will reply that some civilian suffering as a result of the policy is inevitable collateral damage and point to the human rights abuses of the Cuban government itself. Those abuses exist, and they are unquestionably grave. The Castro regime imprisons political dissidents, curbs free speech, and exerts tight-fisted control on the political system.
But if the United States is going to encourage regime change for humanitarian reasons, perhaps it ought to take a closer look at some of its own allies. Cuba does not sentence women to be lashed by a whip if they drive, as occurred in Saudi Arabia last year. Cuba does not imprison young, mentally deficient girls for alleged blasphemy, as has Pakistan. How about China, one of our biggest trading partners? The political system there continues to be at least as repressive as Cuba’s, yet U.S. companies show little moral qualms about trading with the Asian giant.
Seen in this light, the embargo against Cuba is both illogical and arbitrary. Suppose, however, that Cuba does deserve to be singled out for special punishment—that the Castros are every bit the monstrous caricatures they’re made out to be and that they should be chased out of Havana on a rail at the earliest possible moment. Even so, the U.S. embargo simply does not seem to be working. More than two decades after the Berlin Wall fell, Havana still stands. If the embargo has not managed to spur regime change in that time, there’s little reason to believe it will achieve results anytime soon. The longevity of this ineffective policy is almost as impressive as that of Fidel Castro (and the Central Intelligence Agency has reportedly tried to do away with him in over 600 different ways).
Castro critics will claim that the Cuban regime serves as the lynchpin and ideological rallying point of an anti-American alliance consolidating in the Americas. This axis includes governments such as that of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. The truth is, however, that Cuba played no role in bringing any of these socialist governments to power. They were elected due to dynamics specific to each country and a continent-wide dissatisfaction with traditional political leaders.
Cuba’s relationship with these governments is based on genuine opportunities for cooperation, not joint anti-American sentiment. Venezuela, for instance, sends cheap oil to the island in exchange for a supply of doctors. That’s not an ideologically motivated transaction; if anything, it’s one based on supply and demand. Such partnerships are no justification for sustaining the embargo.
Earlier this year, the United States and Cuba drew swords in an acrimonious dispute over who owned the rights to the Havana Club rum trademark. Instead of fighting over it, why not sit down and share a drink? The two countries might discover that they don’t have very many valid reasons to be enemies anymore. Political change in Cuba will come in due time. But until the U.S. unilaterally renounces its senseless embargo, there’s little chance for reconciliation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Americans love to be able to think of one person as our leader. So it’s not surprising that we blow presidential elections entirely out of proportion. Each side whips itself into a panic that if the other guy wins, our country is doomed.
Most Americans don’t realize it, but the president’s constitutional powers are miniscule compared to Congress’s. He needs help to get almost anything substantial accomplished. Just ask President Obama.
Which is why regardless of the result of this election, Washington will remain broken. We have a political system premised on compromise in a country where compromise has become a mortal political sin.
What caused this shift? There are many contributing factors, but none more important than the rise of institutions dedicated to telling people what they want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. From cable news to blogs to think tanks, these organizations work 24/7 to reaffirm people’s pre-existing beliefs and discredit any contradictory facts. Consequently, many liberals and conservatives today inhabit totally different worlds.
The result is that American politics has become disturbingly Manichean. Each side thinks the other is not only mistaken, but devious. This is completely understandable, if everything you ever hear indicates that the only way anyone could disagree with you is if they were deliberately ignoring the truth.
Polarization is personal for me because I showed up on campus freshman year as a Tea Partier. I was convinced that all the facts confirmed my political beliefs and that anyone who disagreed was ignoring them. I was told as much by my most trusted sources of political information: the Wall Street Journal editorial board, Rush Limbaugh, Thomas Sowell, and Fox News.
It wasn’t until I took Ec 10 and found that supply side economics wasn’t supported by historical evidence—as I had always been told—that I began to think much more critically about my worldview. I chose more unbiased sources of information and changed my opinions when the real facts didn’t justify them.
I’ll be the first to admit that it’s exhausting to form political opinions in a world that isn’t black and white anymore. It’s much easier to remain in a cocoon of self-affirmation. Highly personalized sources of political information make it that much easier. I worry that Americans, both liberals and conservatives, can’t resist the temptation.
America’s erosion of trust has had catastrophic consequences. You don’t make deals with people you don’t trust. You defeat them. Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock expressed this mentality with candor, “I have a mindset that says bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view.”
Congress doesn’t work with attitudes like that. On every major issue, Congress now produces endless stopgap measures. Structural solutions must wait because, as David Brooks notes, both parties are drunk on the “fantasy that [they] are about to win a 1932-style victory that will render [their] opponents powerless.”
The parties have certainly become the divisive factions the founders warned against. But let’s look further, to the source of their power. As long as the American electorate selectively chooses its facts, it will be susceptible to the demagoguery that has defined this campaign on both sides. As long as voters continue electing anti-compromise candidates to an institution dependent on compromise, Congress will continue to be dysfunctional, no matter if 83 percent of voters tell pollsters they actually want politicians to compromise.
America is big and it is diverse. No one party is going to get its way all the time. We need to learn to live together and balance our interests as we used to. I believe the future of America rests, above all else, on whether we do.
With this in mind, who should win the White House?
The last two years have been defined by Republican obstructionism. House Republicans in particular have refused to support anything that isn’t exactly what they want.
If Obama is reelected, I have little doubt that we will see four more years of gridlock. Some offer this as a reason to vote Romney, on the assumptions that Moderate Mitt is the real Mitt and that Republicans will be willing to moderate with him after the election.
Wishful thinking. Today, Republican representatives’ nightmares are haunted by conservative primary challengers, not party leaders. Just ask John Boehner.
Electing Romney would reward Republicans for their intransigence over Obama’s term and establish perverse political incentives that would make it even harder for politicians to start compromising again. I’ll take short-term gridlock in exchange for the prospect of less long-term dysfunction any day.
Democrats have their zealots too, of course. The difference is that they don’t currently control their party.
Obama failed to change Washington. That will take not just a compromising president, but a compromising Congress. The project is larger than this two-man election. Still, Obama’s reelection is crucial. You don’t get less gridlock by voting for the party that is spearheading it.

Lyndsey B. Fry ’14 and Michelle L. Picard ’15 have been playing hockey for most of their lives—and this November, they’ll be playing together for the U.S. National Women’s team at the Four Nations Cup in Finland. Both are players on the Harvard women’s hockey team, and the two sat down with FM to talk about the Mighty Ducks and friendship, on and off the ice. The interview has been edited for concision.
 
Lyndsey:
 
“I started watching Mighty Ducks movies—the Disney movies—and probably when I was four my parents ended up buying me the strap-on-your-shoes rollerblades, so I was just going up and down my street and could not stop and loved every second of it. Finally, my dad brought home a stick and put it in my hand.
 
When I was five I started playing roller hockey at a roller rink by my house. At that time, my dad was commuting to California, so I got to see some real Mighty Ducks games, which was cool. When I was six, they built an ice rink by my house, and I started playing ice hockey and never went back to roller.
 
When I was a junior in high school, I got invited to my first camp for the U.S. team. The way it works is, you don’t ever play with the U.S. team all year round unless it’s centralization for the Olympics. Otherwise, you play on your separate teams, and then you go to these camps and make the team hopefully, and then you go to the tournament that’s coming up. So when I was a junior in high school I made my first camp, and then I got invited to my first U-18 team [for players under eighteen years old].
 
Then, I got to Harvard, and that Christmas I made my first over-18 camp. But I didn’t really perform that well there, and then the next year—things weren’t quite going the way I wanted them to go. So this summer I just really committed myself to making it to this August camp where there was going to be a U-22 [over-18] series. I worked really hard and ended up making that U-22 team. And then after that I got picked for this Four Nations tournament, which is what’s coming up in Finland.
 
The Four Nations tournament—it’s us, Canada, Sweden, and Finland, and we just rotate every year. Four Nations is a big tournament; it tells everyone where they’re at. I’m excited to see where I fit in with the best of the best.
 
I met Shelly my second year of U-18s. But I wouldn’t say I knew her that well at that point. It wasn’t until she got here last year that we started getting really close, and now she’s one of my really good friends. She’s an awesome person to be around off the ice and especially on the ice. She’s an incredibly motivated person and she knows what she wants. When my head wasn’t necessarily right last year and hockey wasn’t going well for me, she was a really good person to look up to in that way.
 
It’s an interesting dynamic, just because I’m her upperclassman here but she’s been on the national team before, so she’s the one with the experience. So I respect her so much and look up to her in that regard, and she looks up to me here. It’s really cool. We have a good relationship and we’re both on the same page with everything this year, and I think it’s going to carry out throughout our season.
 
If you’ve never seen hockey before in your life, I think you’d be surprised at how fun it really is to watch. But even if you do watch hockey and you’ve never seen a women’s game, and just assume that it’s not going to be as fun as a men’s game, you’re wrong. What I want people to know is that the women’s side is just as worthy as the men’s side. It’s the truth. It’s a different game, sure, but it’s a fun game to watch and be a part of.”
 
Michelle:
 
“I’ve been playing since I was five or six. My older brother played hockey, so I grew up in the ring. It’s just natural for me to play.
 
For the US team, how it works is, each time there’s a tournament you have to make the team. So just because I made it for this tournament it doesn’t mean that I’ll ever be on it again in the future [laughs]. It’s all invitation-based.
 
My very first time [playing for the national team] was with the U-18 national team. The Worlds were in Chicago, so we had a championship game. The rink was packed with fans. For our championship game—I remember this moment so clearly—we were coming out for the third period. We were ahead, but I don’t remember the score. The band was chanting “USA!” My heart was pounding. It was one of the most memorable moments.
 
This August I was invited to our training camp, which is forty girls, and you’ll be on teams and you practice and play games and the coaches are watching you and evaluating you. A team was named, and we played up in Calgary against Canada’s U-22 team, and those were basically the tryouts for the tournament coming up in November.
 
In August, there were five of us from Harvard who were [at the training camp]. Two got hurt, so now aren’t playing, but it’s exciting that Lyndsey and I get to go. I wish it was more of us, but things happen. It’s cool because we get to know each other so well at Harvard, and to have that familiar face and friend on the team makes it more comfortable—someone you know who’s always there.
 
I first met Lyndsey when we were seventeen. We played on a U-18 world championship team together in Chicago. I didn’t really get to know her that well in that tournament, but then when I came here obviously we were teammates and that’s when we really became friends. It’s cool that we get to go play this together, too. I’m excited we get to share this experience.
 
I try to get her the puck, and she tries to score. On the ice. it doesn’t matter that she’s from Harvard—we’re all just teammates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers released an open letter late Thursday afternoon complaining that Harvard’s recently released health care plans for non-union workers offer those employees a health care structure similar to one it already rejected for union workers.
HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of the University’s librarians, secretaries, and other non-faculty staff, responded in its letter to the “open enrollment materials” Harvard released just over a week ago, in which Harvard’s Human Resources department informed employees about their benefits plans.
While Thursday’s letter lauded what union leaders see as “only very slightly” increasing health care costs, it described the University’s changes for 2013 health care plans as an “unfortunate step backward” in the contract negotiations between HUCTW and the University, which have dragged on since the old contract’s scheduled expiration date of June 30.
The relationship between union members and the University is currently governed by the outdated contract, and negotiations remain deadlocked. Health care benefits, along with salary increases, have long been a major point of contention in contract talks.
Earlier in contract negotiations, HUCTW proposed a new health care structure, which the union said would shift some of the financial burden associated with health care off of lower-paid employees and onto higher-paid employees.
In an October open letter, Harvard Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann said that the union’s proposal for a new health care structure “did not meet our test for a fair and equitable agreement.”
Yet the union says that Harvard just offered a similarly structured plan to non-union workers.
Harvard Assistant Vice President for Communications Paul Andrew said that the University is indeed committed to pursuing a progressive benefits system. Harvard’s new plan, he argued, differs significantly from that proposed by HUCTW.
“The University did reject a proposal put forward by the union to reduce healthcare premiums for HUCTW members, shifting those costs onto other Harvard employees,” Andrew wrote. “Changes [in non-union open enrollment materials] are in line with our commitment to fairness for employees who are represented by the union and to employees across the University as whole.”
On the contrary, HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that the union’s proposal was cost-neutral for the University and would not have placed any more burden on non-HUCTW workers. The letter accused Harvard of pursuing an “aggressive strategy of shifting costs off of the University and onto employees.”
This letter, like other HUCTW communications throughout the elongated negotiations, stressed the union leaders’ belief that the University has rebounded from the recession enough to treat its employees more generously.
But Andrew said the plan offered to non-union workers reflects what Harvard can afford. “The benefits changes reflected in this year’s open enrollment packets are a direct result of the financial pressures facing the University that were detailed in the annual financial report,” Andrew said. Harvard’s annual Financial Report, which was released Friday morning, disclosed a budget deficit of $4.5 million for fiscal year 2012, a figure which represents just slightly more than .1 percent of the total annual revenues.
HUCTW’s letter also said that health care cost changes had not been described or explained in University communications.
“I’m really worried by what it’s supposed to signal that the University introduced these changes without any rationale,” Jaeger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The challenges facing democratic decision-makers took center stage in a talk with former prime minister of Greece, George A. Papandreou, and former president of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad, on Friday.
The speakers engaged in a discussion about their leadership experiences in times of economic crisis before a crowd of about 100 students and guests as a part of “Conversations with Kirkland,” a student-led lecture series.
“Making difficult decisions while people are protesting outside your office is not simple,” said Papandreou, referring to demonstrations in Greece during his time as prime minister from 2009 to 2011.
Mahuad said that modern democratic governments must confront the conflict between the electoral mandate and the implicit trust underlying that mandate.
“You can’t govern without polling, but the problem is what you do with the poll,” Mahuad said. “Am I just a follower or do I have an obligation to do what I think is the best?”
Papandreou said that he thinks the future of democracy lies in a strong civil society engaged in a parallel debate from which the government can draw new ideas.
“Bring in different views; let them clash,” Papandreou said, speaking of debate as the key to political decision-making.
He also said that leaders have to make decisions based on assumptions. “We began an odyssey, but we had no GPS and the sky was clouded,” Papandreou said. “We didn’t know how to get to Ithaca.”
Mahuad summarized the challenge of governance under dire financial conditions: “Leaders need to make such enormous economic reforms that will kill them politically.”
When asked about the role of media in the decision-making process, Papandreou and Mahuad agreed that information is necessary for political participation.
“The essence of leadership is connecting to the people,” Mahuad said.
Papandeou stessed the challenge of conveying to the public that difficult decisions are not futile.
“Free media is a deep issue underlying democracy,” he said.
The talk gave the audience a chance to hear personal insights into the challenges of democratic leadership in an informal setting.
“It was reassuring to hear how personally connected and invested these leaders were in decision-making,” Maria L. Smith ’16 said.

Colorful cloths, skeletons, and marigolds covered the fireplace at the front of the Leverett dining hall Saturday night as an altar for Dia de los Muertos, a Mexican holiday held November 1 and 2 to remember deceased family and friends.
The celebration is the biggest event of the year for Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA.
“We’re using creativity and our culture to respect, honor, and remember those that came before us,” said RAZA officer Gabriella R. Herrera ’15, who said that her family celebrates Dia de los Muertos every year with prayers and candles. “I love that we all come together for a very good purpose.”
As Herrera laid out Mexican food, students grabbed plates and watched a performance by the dance group La Piñata. Children, who were dressed in bright orange and red t-shirts and skull masks, ran and danced to the beat of a drum.
Mariachi Veritas de Harvard took the stage next, followed by several students who read poems and sang.
Natalia M. Hendrickson ’15, who sang a song in Spanish to a hushed audience, said that her favorite part of the event was seeing people come together to share and celebrate the holiday.
“I think it’s important not to keep your grief inside,” she said.
President of RAZA Edward Escalon Jr. ’14 asked the audience to call out the names of loved ones that had passed, saying that those loved ones were there in the audience that night. After each name was called, the audience said “presente” to mark their presence.
Melissa A. Naidoo ’13 said that she had been to the RAZA celebration each year since she was a freshman.
“It’s always great coming each year and seeing the amount of talent showcased,” she said. “It has sacred roots and celebrates past loved ones—it’s not so much as mourning their passing, but celebrating their whole lives.”
Dressed in traditional attire and balancing candles on their head, the Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán ended the series of performances with a folk dance.
After the performances, students ended the evening by eating traditional sweetened buns called pan de muertos­—bread of the dead—and painting their faces like skeletons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Presidents do not run the country on their own, and more often than not they do it with the help of Harvard professors.
After President Barack Obama was elected in 2008, roughly a dozen Harvard professors left their university posts to work for the new administration in Washington. If re-elected, Obama is expected to keep many of his Harvard advisers in place.
But even if Tuesday’s election results in a win for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the revolving door between Cambridge and the capital will likely remain intact. In keeping with presidential tradition, a Romney administration would likely pull a number of Harvard professors into the White House or other government offices, political experts say.
“If you’re a president, one of the things you probably want to do is bring in people who have more of an academic and outsider perspective,” said C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of Harvard’s Institute of Politics. “You want people from the outside to come in with more fresh ideas and a more data-driven experience.”
Harvard professors are always a key part of that perspective, Grayson said. And because both Romney and Obama are Harvard graduates, their connections to the faculty here are particularly strong.
Romney counts six Harvard professors as current campaign advisers and several others as close friends or former advisers. Many of his top staffers, including chief policy adviser Lanhee Chen ’99, are Harvard graduates.
Another likely draftee from the Harvard faculty may include economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, say political experts. Mankiw currently serves as one of Romney’s top economic advisers and is often mentioned as a likely appointee to either the National Economic Council or the Treasury Department.
Mankiw, who teaches the popular introductory course Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” was one of President George W. Bush’s top economic advisers from 2003 to 2005. Like most professors contacted for this article, Mankiw was not willing to talk about his relationship with the Romney campaign or the potential administration.
“I am very happy being a professor at Harvard, and I do not anticipate changing jobs anytime soon,” Mankiw wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Other possible appointees include economics professor Martin S. Feldstein, Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen, and Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter—all of whom worked in the White House under Ronald Reagan. Christensen is a close friend of Romney’s and, like Porter, he is a fellow Mormon.
While Feldstein told The Crimson that he is not interested in leaving Harvard, Christensen said he would serve either a Romney or Obama administration if he was interested in the position. Porter did not return repeated request for comment.
Experts expect Harvard professors would fill a number of smaller government positions and advisory roles as they have in the Obama administration. Romney campaign advisers also include Kennedy School professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan, Law School professor Mary Ann Glendon, Kennedy School professor Paul E. Peterson, Graduate School of Education professor Martin R. West, and Belfer Center fellow Paula J. Dobriansky, most of whom have worked for other Republican administrations in the past.
The majority of faculty advising Romney declined to comment on their work for the campaign, or the possibility that they would join a future administration. Those who replied said that they are happy with their positions at Harvard.
But Grayson said that the way professors feel about Harvard often does not matter much when a president comes knocking.
“It’s hard to turn down a president who asks you to do something and says your country needs you, especially for these higher profile positions,” he said.
The revolving door between politics and academics serves both presidents looking for fresh perspective in Washington and universities who want faculty with real world experience, Grayson explained. The frequent turnover in Washington largely driven by the cyclical back-and-forth of power between parties also ensures a steady exchange between universities and administrations.
“When a party loses power, those people have to go somewhere,” Grayson said. “So you can go to a think tank or you can go to a university so you continue to write and think about these issues.”
Because Harvard tends to attract more Democrats to the faculty than Republicans, it is unlikely that a potential Romney administration would draft as many professors as Obama has. The professors that Romney would likely select are primarily from the economics department or the Business school, Grayson said.
Obama drew most heavily from the Law School in the days following his election.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Law School Dean Elena Kagan were two of the most high-profile faculty to head to Washington in the administration’s earliest days, as the head of the National Economic Council and Solicitor General respectively. Obama also brought in Law School professors Daniel J. Meltzer ’72, Jody Freeman, and Cass R. Sunstein ’75 among others.
Summers, like many Harvard professors who followed Obama to Washington, returned to campus after two years of service in order to maintain his status as a tenured professor. Meltzer, Freeman, and Sunstein have also returned to Harvard in the last few years. Sunstein’s wife, former Kennedy School professor Samantha Power, still works for the president as a director on the National Security Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This September, Harvard Medical School professor David S. Jones ’92 introduced students to assisted suicide, one of the most publicized ethical dilemmas of modern medicine, in the second lecture for his popular new Gen Ed course Ethical Reasoning 33: “Medical Ethics and History.”
In the course’s syllabus, Jones compared physician assisted suicide to the hot-button topic of abortion, writing that “no issues in medical ethics arouse greater passions.” For Jones’s course, the question of whether doctors can provide life-ending medication to terminally ill patients introduced Harvard undergraduates to basic tools of moral reasoning.
But for Massachusetts voters this year, the question is more than academic.
This Tuesday, voters will weigh in on Massachusetts Ballot Question 2, Prescribing Medication to End Life, a law proposed by initiative petition that is often referred to by its supporters as the “Death with Dignity Act.”
The proposed law would allow Mass. licensed physicians to prescribe medication to terminally ill patients meeting certain conditions that they could self-administer to end their life.
Harvard affiliates have been powerful voices in this year’s debate over physician-assisted suicide—an unsurprising reality, given the effect the initiative could have on those at the Medical School, the School of Public Health, the 17 affiliated hospitals and research institutes, and even professors in the Law School or government department.
Among Harvard professors and students, as with voters across Massachusetts, opinion remains split on both the philosophy and practice of Question 2.
THE 0.2 PERCENT
If passed, Massachusetts would become the fourth state, after Oregon, Washington, and Montana, to legalize some form of physician-assisted suicide in the last two decades.
According to Lachlan Forrow, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school, Question 2’s presence on the ballot is representative of the changing ways that Americans are relating to their health and health care.
“The fundamental important message is that Americans are deeply dissatisfied and worried about the care that they will receive at the end of life,” Forrow said.
The Massachusetts initiative would apply specifically to terminally ill patients who have been demed mentally competent and have less than six months to live.
Although he has not openly taken a position on the Massachusetts initiative, Forrow—who serves as the director of ethics and palliative care programs at the Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deconess Medical Center—has in past weeks written and spoken publicly about the history and real-world implications of assisted-suicide policies. He emphasized that the experiences of Oregon, the first state to legalize the practice in 1994, demonstrate the rarity of assisted-suicide requests.
“In Oregon, out of 1,000 people who die, two request and get a prescription for a lethal dosage of medication,” Forrow said. “That means 99.8 percent of people’s needs of care for end of life have nothing to do with [those who choose that option]. Even if this passes, at best, this would be a 0.2 percent solution for the challenges of caring at the end of life.”
AN ETHICAL DILEMMA
Despite what Harvard Medical School professor Robert Truog called the “vanishingly small” proportion of patients who choose assisted suicide, many of the Massachusetts’ initiatives major supporters and opponents say they are motivated by fundamental moral or philosophical concerns, regardless of the numerical impact of the initiative.
For Marcia Angell, a senior lecturer on social medicine at the Medical School and one of the initiative’s major public proponents, this question of autonomy and choice has a clear answer.
“It seems to me that this most personal and faithful of decisions belongs with the patients and no one else: not the church, not the Mass. Medical Society, not the state, no one but the patient. And it hurts no one if the patient makes this choice,” she said.
Angell said that the experiences of those who have taken advantage of the law in Oregon shows that the availability of this choice is valuable, even if not used by many.
“Good palliative care and assisted suicide—those two things are not mutually exclusive any more than the medical treatment of heart failure and heart transplantation. You use one when the other fails,” Angell said. “Allowing the most desperate of patients to have assisted dying to bring about a slightly faster, more peaceful death, does nothing to the other 99.8 percent of patients.”
But for some of the bill’s opponents at Harvard, the issue holds just as much philosophical weight.
For example, Harvard Right to Life, an undergraduate student group that has focused on issues ranging from abortion to euthanasia, has publicly opposed the initiative.
“Harvard Right to Life stands for the right to life from conception to natural death,” HLR president Matthew R. Menendez ’14 said. “So it is our view that it is never right to voluntarily end a life, and so in that sense we are opposed to [the Death with Dignity initiative].”
A COMPLICATED QUESTION
But for many voters, the debate over the initiative is not a moral question with a simple yes or no answer. Several Harvard affiliates say that the specific wording and implementation of the question is the more important consideration.
Lisa Lehmann, an associate professor of medicine and medical ethics, said that her views on the question are complicated.
“While I’m certainly someone who believes in increasing and furthering and advancing patient autonomy, I think that there are a lot of problems with the current ballot initiative,” said Lehmann.
Primarily, Lehmann stressed the potential problems in having this initiative without any mandate for psychiatric evaluation. Citing data from patients considering assisted suicide in Oregon, Lehmann said, “only 7 percent of patients were referred to psychiatrists for mental health evaluations.” Many patients with terminal illnesses have some form of depression, “but the safeguard of mandatory evaluation by a psychiatrist is not in place in this legislation and I think that raises some concerns” said Lehmann.
A CLOSE VOTE
As Election Day approaches, students and professors on both side of the issue say that divided opinion, both on campus and throughout the Commonwealth, have left the fate of the initiative unclear.
In recent weeks, polling on the question has showed an increasingly narrow margin of support. A Suffolk University/News 7 poll released last week showed 47 percent in support of the bill and 41 percent opposed, a stark contrast to the 37 point spread seen in polls taken in September.
“I think it’s going to be very close,” Angell said. “The polls were overwhelmingly in support of it, but they’re narrowing now as a result of lots of misleading ads that are being shown on television. The opposition to Question 2 has put a lot of money into this and it seems to be having an effect. They seem to be fear mongering.”
At a recent event sponsored by the Harvard Undergraduate Bioethics Society, which does not take a formalized stance on issues, the opinions in the room were as divided as those of voters across the state.
“I just hope that students voting in Massachusetts have the opportunity to engage in dialogue with each other and understand the policies at stake here,” the society’s co-president Gus G. Ruchman ’15 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 29, 1911, Massachusetts did what no state had done before: It banned marijuana.
This prohibition sparked a national trend, culminating in the federal criminalization of the drug. Now, more than a century later, voters in Massachusetts stand poised to lead the state in the opposite direction.
When voters go to the polls on Tuesday, they will decide whether to vote yea or nay to Ballot Question 3 which, if approved, would legalize medicinal use of marijuana for patients with “debilitating conditions.”
With a written certification by a physician, patients would be able to purchase a 60-day supply of cannabis from any of the 35 dispensaries sanctioned by this initiative.
A number of other states across the nation are also considering the question of medical marijuana on their ballots, and 17 states and the District of Columbia already allow some kind of medicinal marijuana usage.
While the debate over medical marijuana has provoked strong feelings among both proponents and detractors, it remains to be seen whether or not Massachusetts voters will reverse the decision they made 100 years ago.
PUSHING POT
Polls by The Boston Globe as well as Suffolk University show a majority of voters support the legalization of medical marijuana—the most recent Boston Globe poll suggesting that 63 percent of likely Massachusetts voters are in favor.
Supporters of the initiative argue that marijuana can be very effective in treating individuals with conditions ranging anywhere from glaucoma to AIDS.
In particular, advocates point to evidence provided by organizations like the National Cancer Institute which reports on its website that “cannabis or cannabinoids may have benefits in treating the symptoms of cancer,” and the California Pacific Medical Center whose recent study on animals has shown cannabis could stop the development of cancer cells in humans.
Harvard Medical School professor emeritus Lester S. Grinspoon, the author of “Marihuana Reconsidered,” said that marijuana is “a remarkably benign drug which is capable of doing...remarkable things medically.”
Before conducting research on marijuana’s effects, Grinspoon was a staunch opponent of its use and was “terribly concerned” that the drug would negatively affect his close friend Carl Sagan, the well-known astronomer, who enjoyed smoking marijuana.
However, he now supports the full legalization of both medical marijuana and marijuana for recreational use.
“I have always believed since I had my epiphany that the only way to deal with this substance is to get rid of the prohibition and treat it like alcohol,” said Grinspoon.
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws supports state-level initiatives like this one because they do not see full national legalization as a feasible, achievable goal for the near future.
“If you look at alcohol prohibition as a model, the federal government did not, on its own, decide to abolish alcohol prohibition,” said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML. “It only did so after a number of states opted out of it.”
Armentano argued that the Drug Enforcement Administration should downgrade its classification of cannabis from a Schedule I drug, which “defines it as having no accepted medical utility and places it in the same category of harm as heroin.”
DUPED BY THE DOPE LAW?
Opponents of the initiative are quick to point out that the federal government’s classification of cannabis, although potentially flawed, means that Massachusetts should not legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.
“Medicinal is the word we have a difficulty with because marijuana is a Schedule I drug under the DEA, Drug Enforcement Agency, and the FDA has not recognized it as it being medicinal,” said Dr. Richard V. Aghababian ’70, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, an organization of more than 24,000 physicians and medical students in Massachusetts.
The Medical Society opposes the ballot measure primarily because the organization does not believe that scientific research has conclusively proven that marijuana use has health benefits.
“If it were Schedule II, it could be subjected to rigorous scientific study to prove its efficacy over currently available drugs on things like nausea, chemotherapy, cancer, and the like,” Aghababian continued.
John S. Scheft ’81, an attorney who represented the Mass. Prevention Alliance before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts on issues related to Question 3, argues that the text of the proposed law is poorly constructed and contains several loopholes. Scheft, who has given legal advice to anti-medical marijuana groups, believes that the law which would be enacted by Question 3 will allow unbridled access to marijuana without the presence of a “debilitating condition.” The law, he pointed out, contains a clause granting medical marijuana use for “other conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient’s physician.”
According to Scheft, a majority of medical marijuana users in California and Colorado, states which have already legalized medical marijuana, are people with a history of addiction and fake diagnoses for conditions like anxiety and chronic pain.
“I really think a lot of voters are getting ‘doped’ because they’ll say that they think marijuana is really important for very sick people and I say I agree, but read the law, that’s not who’s going to get access to it,” he said.
HASHING OUT THE ISSUE
For many Harvard students, the legalization of medical marijuana is a clear cut issue: it should be legalized, they say.
“I support it,” said Donny R. Yung ’16.  “If the doctors think it is a good treatment, it shouldn’t be off the table.”
Kate R. Carlow ’15, a resident of Connecticut, which last month became the 16th state in the nation to legalize medical marijuana, echoed Yung’s statements.
“I do believe that medical marijuana should be legalized,” said Carlow, adding, “I have friends who have benefited [from medical marijuana]”.
Though most students support medical marijuana use, some are more hesitant to get behind a law which, they say, could be exploited and misused.
“Legalizing marijuana for medical purposes creates a gray area between what it should actually be used for [and what it] is technically not legally supposed to be used for,” said David M. Larkin ’16, a registered Massachusetts voter who said he would vote no for Question 3.
Not all, however, held such a firm stance either for or against legalizing medical usage of the drug.
“The criminalization of drugs, especially marijuana, is always very tricky,” said Justin D. Porter ’16.
“It’s a really hard question,” said Julia Wang ’14.  “I would be cautious in terms of considering whether or not to vote for this issue.”
SKY-HIGH CONSEQUENCES?
If the ballot question is approved, how the new law will play out and affect marijuana use in Massachusetts remains unclear.
Beyond the issue of ensuring that only those who need marijuana receive it, critics point out that the Question 3 text has no age restrictions. This loophole could make it easier for minors to obtain marijuana for recreational use, according to Scheft, who called the law’s loopholes “outrageous.”
UCLA professor Mark A. R. Kleiman, formerly a professor at the Kennedy School, said he expects the availability of medical marijuana will create enough market competition to drive prices down, leading to greater access for minors.
However, Jeffrey A. Miron, a senior lecturer in Harvard’s Economics department,  foresees that the overall impact of the proposed law will be quite small.
“Marijuana is close to de facto being legal already. It is decriminalized already in Massachusetts, so people can purchase it without fear of being arrested, simply for being in possession for small amounts of an ounce or less,” said Miron, who in the past has spoken out in favor of fully legalizing marijuana.
The only changes Miron envisioned was a change in the habits of those who already smoke marijuana, and not in the number of people who do use marijuana.
“There are people who don’t consume alcohol, there are people who don’t eat ice cream, there are people who don’t do lots of things that they can readily afford,” said Miron.
Whether or not medical marijuana alters the landscape of drug use may not be clear for many months, but the election this week will determine its fate in Massachusetts.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 5
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article said that citizens in Colorado will cast votes on whether to legalize medical marijuana in the 2012 election. In fact, medical marijuana is already legal in Colorado; the 2012 ballot measure would legalize small amounts of the drug for recreational use.

As Election Day approaches, two-thirds of Americans feel that voting is the best way to rectify the nation’s current “leadership crisis,” according to a survey published by the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and political consulting firm Merriman River Group.
The poll, called the National Leadership Index, showed that 69 percent of Americans believe that the U.S. faces such a leadership crisis. While public confidence in leadership has risen, it remains below average on the scale designed by the Center for Public Leadership.
“Any time you see an increase in confidence in our leaders, it is encouraging,” the survey’s lead author Seth A. Rosenthal said in a press release. “At the same time, a vast majority of Americans believe we have a crisis in leadership and that we will decline as a nation unless we do something about it.”
The survey, which collected data regarding various sectors of American leadership, revealed that the public holds above-average confidence in only military and medical leadership. Confidence in Congress and Wall Street was almost in the “none at all” range, with Congress holding the lowest rating.
“I think the thing that may reflect somewhat on the election is confidence in leadership in business, the only sector that went up among liberals, conservatives, and moderates,” Rosenthal said.
Rosenthal attributed the increase in confidence in business leaders to improved unemployment numbers, nothing that the data for the survey was collected in September, before October’s worsened unemployment rates were announced.
Derek J. Bekebrede ’13, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said that he thought President Barack Obama’s failure to utilize the Democratic Party’s large majority in Congress during the first half of his term may be a reason for low confidence in executive leadership.
“Congress is the bottom of the barrel, and the executive is down there,” Bekebrede said. “You have a lack of comprehensive solution coming from the current administration.”
But Adan Acevedo ’13, president of the Harvard College Democrats, showed confidence in the nation’s political leadership.
“Overall, we have amazing leaders both in Congress and in the Executive Office,” Acevedo said. “Individuals who find it their mission to block the agenda of the president [are] not showing the leadership we need.”
Despite their divergent stances, both Bekebrede and Acevedo agreed that voting could improve whatever leadership crisis the nation may suffer from.
“Voting, yes, is the best way to fix it—really the only way to fix it,” Bekebrede said.

When audience members at “Evening of Ventures” were asked if they hoped to become entrepreneurs, an overwhelming majority of the hands in the room shot up.
Friday’s sold-out event, hosted by Harvard College Venture Partners, consisted of two afternoon panel discussions, one on entrepreneurship and one on venture capitalism. Following the panels, students attended a dinner where they could interact with the panelists, many of whom are recent Harvard graduates.
Omar Hussain, an entrpreneurship panelist who founded software company Anchorsilk, discussed the wealth of opportunities open to students in the Boston area. He said that the multitude of college students is “the biggest resource that Boston offers.”
Panelists also emphasized the importance of advisers in any financial endeavor.
David Beisel, a partner at NextView Ventures who served on the venture capitalist panel, said that the experience such advisers provide is invaluable.
“We hit so many brick walls along the way that could have been avoided if we had been more proactive in finding mentors,” he said.
Many of the entrepreneurs encouraged students to seek out professional experience at small start-up companies.
In an email to The Crimson, Peter A. Boyce II ’13, a co-founder of Harvard College Venture Partners who helped organize the event, outlined ways in which students could gain skills and experience relevant to entrepreneurship and venture capitalism while at Harvard.
He recommended that students pursue opportunities through the Innovation Lab, Computer Science 50, and Engineering Sciences 21: “The Innovators’ Practice”.
Additionally, he advised interested students to seek out groups like Hack Harvard, Harvard College Venture Partners, the Harvard College Social Innovation Collaborative, and the Harvard Computer Society.
Grace G. Gee ’15 said that she felt that the young ages of most of the panelists made the event more helpful than previous conferences she had attended.
“The panelists were really genuine, and what they said was really applicable to where we as students are now,” she said.
Despite a harsh economic climate, Boyce was optimistic about the future of venture capital.
“One thing that hasn’t lost it’s appeal since the financial crisis is the desire to start businesses, solve real problems, and create value,” he wrote.

UPDATED: Nov. 8, 2012, at 1:53 a.m.
After expelling two members, the Undergraduate Council will hold two special elections concurrent with the general presidential race, Election Commission Chair Elston He ’13 announced at Sunday’s meeting.
Michelle E. Matsuba ’14 and Phillip Z. Yao ’13, both Winthrop House residents, were expelled from their seats due to unexcused absences from committee or general meetings, said UC Secretary Christopher A. Smiles ’15.
Matsuba could not be reached for comment, and Yao said that he had independently decided to step down.
“I have been on the UC since my freshman year and have really enjoyed my time,” he said. “As a first semester senior, it can be hectic, and I have had less time to dedicate to the UC. I’m continuing to go to all the Education Committee meetings because that is still something that is really important to me.”
Candidate declarations for the special election are due Friday evening.
After He made his annoucement, Council members pressured him to clarify the EC’s policy banning campaigns from using mail merges. Mail merges, which make mass e-mail blasts look “personalized” by using the recipient’s name, violate a rule which specifies that candidates may not send unsolicited messages online.
Earlier this year UC candidate Samuel F. Wohns ’14 received a campaign suspension.
“How are you going to draw the line ultimately?” asked UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair Nicholas W. Galat ’13. “What is the definition of knowing someone?”
Election Commission Chair He clarified that all e-mails need to be “individually personalized.”
UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said if these questions had arisen sooner, the Council would have been in a better position to act.
The UC did not ultimately decide to propose changes to the rule.
The Council also moved to pass a resolution to support Hurricane Sandy disaster victims by sponsoring a disaster relief fundraiser and soliciting donations for the American Red Cross.
The UC also formalized the referendum process by clarifying the timeline, rules, and format for student-initiated UC petitions. Referendums are student-initiated petitions, which, once they earn enough signatures, are put up for a College-wide vote.
Bicknell also touted the Council’s soon-to-be-launched “We The Crimson” web tool, which will allow students to create petitions, organize them by category, and vote for those that they support.

Despite Republican challenger Tom Tierney’s left-leaning platform, experts predict that incumbent Democrat and 36-year veteran Congressman Ed Markey will secure the Fifth Congressional seat after the election this Tuesday.
“Truth be told, I don’t think many of us think this is a race,” said Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, a former Boston City Councillor and a Massachusetts political scene staple.
Both candidates vying to represent the district, which encompasses Harvard’s campus and much of Central Cambridge, have stressed the urgency of the nation’s economic problems. They have focused on stagnant unemployment levels and ballooning national debt.
In addressing these issues, Markey emphasized the value of investing in education and innovation. He said that Republican-driven legislation would result in cuts for important funding in clean energy, biotechnology, the National Institutes of Health, and other sectors.
“The consequences of that would be disastrous for the Massachusetts economy,” he said, adding that the election is a “fight over the best way to create jobs.”
As one of the longest-serving members of the House, Markey boasts a history of service for Congressional committees related to the energy and the telecommunications industries. He currently serves as the highest ranking Democrat in the House Natural Resources Committee.
If re-elected, the Massachusetts native said that he would work to advocate for increased use of renewable energy as well as legislation to protect the privacy of students who use technology.
Similarly, Tierney has stressed economic issues on the campaign trail.
As a relatively moderate Republican, his platform leans left, revolving around four objectives: preserving the Social Security program, reforming “Obamacare,” altering the tax policy, and lowering unemployment.
Tierney, who said he would push for increased taxes, called Romney’s tax plan “crazy” and argued for a return to Clinton-Gingrich era tax policies.
Given the polarized nature of today’s Congress and the Tea Party’s increased presence, Tierney said, only a Republican and a fresh face can affect broad change in the House.
“After 36 years, [Markey] is just burnt out. He has no more fight left,” said the Republican challenger, saying that his competitor lacked his “fire in the belly.”
Tierney, who works as a self-employed consulting actuary, has run for Congress seven times, though he said that only three of the races—the 1984, 2010, and the current election—were “serious.” The other four contests, he said, were “protest runs” and “campaigns of honor.”
With his atypical blend of Republicanism and left-leaning economic views, Tierney said that he has lacked support of his party establishment.
Given Markey’s history of service and popularity in the area, most experts predict that he will easily win. He has earned endorsements from both The Boston Globe and The Melrose Free Press.
DiCara called the newly-redesigned Fifth Congressional District a “safe, Democratic district.”
He also downplayed the argument that Markey’s many years in the House have left him burnt out, instead pointing to his expertise on global warming and the telecommunications industry.
“He is full of ideas, full of energy,” he said. “[One of Markey’s races] hasn’t been close since the first time he ran.”
Likewise, Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh said that “there’s no way Markey is going to lose.”
“People always underestimate Ed Markey when he comes to his races,” she said. “He works the district pretty hard.”
The area, previously represented by Congressman Michael Capuano as part of the Eighth Congressional District, was redistricted earlier this year into a new Fifth District. Capuano, who is unopposed, will now represent the rest of Cambridge in the newly formed Seventh District.

School Yourself, a start-up founded by Zachary D. Wissner-Gross and John Lee, won a $25,000 inaugural grant from the Hertz Foundation’s Newman Entrepreneurial Fund for a project reimaging the traditional textbook.
The New York and Boston-based team is trying to recreate education from the ground up by reformatting textbooks to take advantage of the interactive features on a computer, tablet, or mobile device, explained Wissner-Gross, who completed his Ph.D. in physics from Harvard in late August.
Wissner-Gross demonstrated their “Hands-On Calculus” book, set to roll out in a couple of weeks.  Containing far less text than the average textbook—he estimated it would only be around 50 pages if printed—it primarily uses interactive activities, such as asking students to find a function that is its own derivative by finger-drawing functions and watching the derivatives change in real-time.
School Yourself is part of a general trend towards more tech-savvy education, a trend that also includes the growing deluge of online courses like Harvard and MIT’s edX, Wissner-Gross said. Other start-ups have a similar model to School Yourself, but there are almost none in the STEM—Science, Technology, Engineering, Math—fields, Wissner-Gross said.
A former Physics 15a: “Introductory Mechanics and Relativity” teaching fellow, Wissner-Gross said the project combined his love of teaching with his fascination with how games engage people.
Attributing the latter to his experiences as an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he said his dormmates would “all play games with each other all the time.” Instead of parties, he said, they would engage in Super Smash Bros or Risk soirees.
Solidifying their vision after getting the opportunity to write for Apple’s iBookstore, the School Yourself team realized a few textbook giants controlled 90 percent of the market, but did not take advantage of any touchscreen features.
“We wanted to put together the best [textbook] possible, and make sure the user is touching the screen at every point and doing everything themselves,” said Wissner-Gross, rather than just providing a ligher verson of the original text.
The resulting start-up, School Yourself, was the runner-up in Harvard’s inaugural President’s Challenge earlier this year, using its $15,000 prize to help launch their first two books: “Trigonometry” and “Hands-On Precalculus”, which are currently the two highest rated math textbooks on the iBookstore, Wissner-Gross said.
The team is beginning to contact schools, a harder field because “they’re more set in their ways [and] on tighter budgets than families,” Wissner-Gross said.
“Scalability has been solved by the internet,” he said, referencing the ability of groups like School Yourself to reach millions around the world.
In the future, the team hopes to track user interaction in order to adapt the books to better fit behaviors.
Additionally, Wissner-Gross said he wants to make the activities even more game-like.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: Nov. 5
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that School Yourself co-founder Zachary D. Wissner-Gross completed his Ph.D. last spring; in fact, he defended his thesis in late August. It also incorrectly said that the two books created by School Yourself were the highest rated books in the iBookstore; they are in fact the highest rated math textbooks but not the highest rated books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Harvard picked the president, half the men who have occupied the Oval Office in the past 128 years never would have made it to the White House.
According to records of Harvard straw polls over The Crimson’s 139-year history, the winner of the poll at Harvard—this year, Barack Obama by a wide margin—has won the real thing only 50 percent of the time.
The Crimson records date back to 1884, when James G. Blaine beat out Grover Cleveland by just 20 votes among Harvard men. Presidential polls at Harvard have been speculatively traced all the way to 1788, the very first presidential election in which George Washington essentially ran unopposed.
Over that time, the political views of the student body have shifted along with—and sometimes against—the tides of history. Harvard picked Republicans—the party of Calvin Coolidge and Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, but also of losing contenders like Charles Evan Hughes—in every contest from 1884 to World War II, save 1912. In that year, as the Republican Party split its vote between incumbent President William Howard Taft and Roosevelt, who decided four years after his term ended that he had not had enough of the presidency, Democrat Woodrow Wilson managed to take the most Crimson votes. The same phenomenon occurred on a national level.
Even the Harvard pedigree of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904 and a president of The Harvard Crimson, was insufficient to take the top of The Crimson’s poll. As the rest of the country voted overwhelmingly for Roosevelt, the student body picked Herbert Hoover—the man hated nationwide for supposedly bringing on the scourge of the Great Depression—then Alfred M. Landon and Wendell Willkie, all by significant margins. Clearly, economic woes dogged the Harvard voter far less than the ordinary election-goer.
At Harvard, the famously incorrect front-page headline “Dewey Defeats Truman” would indeed have been accurate, as twice as many Crimson voters picked Thomas E. Dewey as the real victor Harry S. Truman.
In 1952, the Harvard Young Republican Club charged The Crimson with “an irresponsible display of partisanship,” saying the votes had been manipulated through “insidious statistical maneuvering” when competing tallies emerged for the picks of the Law School and Adams House.
In 1960, a Democrat won the poll by an absolute majority for the first time: Harvard alumnus and youth favorite John F. Kennedy ’40. By 1972, Harvard had grown to be such a Democratic stronghold that Richard M. Nixon, who won 49 states and more than 60 percent of the popular vote in the national election, carried only 8.7 percent of Harvard students’ votes.
Harvard voters picked a third party candidate in a 1980 poll, with 40 percent choosing independent John B. Anderson, who won 6.6 percent of the nationwide popular vote. The Crimson’s editorial board veered still further from the mainstream, endorsing Barry Commoner, who took only .27 percent of the national vote.
Political preferences were not always consistent across the College. In 1996, for example, while Kristen Gore ’99 was living in the House that her father Al Gore ’69 inhabited long before he ran for vice president that year, 73.9 percent of her Dunster housemates chose Bill Clinton. Cabot was the least Democratic House at the time, with 57.7 percent of voters preferring Clinton over Bob Dole.
That poll drew on information from 430 respondents; since then, the polls that picked Democrats Gore, Kerry, and Obama were based on the participation of 351 to 471 students. This year’s landslide victory for Obama is based on the preferences of more than 1,500 students who indicated their choices in The Crimson’s online survey.
But in years of high poll participation or low, of conformity to national opinion or contrarianism, The Crimson has consistently endorsed voting, for one candidate or another. As a 1924 editorialist wrote, “If one wishes to criticize the government during the next four years (and who would give up that priceless privilege?) voting is the prerequisite.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than three-fourths of Harvard students picked Barack Obama for president in a Crimson poll, a landslide result paralleled in real life only by Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s win in the election of 1936.
In The Crimson’s recent survey of Harvard University undergraduate and graduate students, 77 percent of respondents picked Obama, while 17 percent chose Republican opponent Mitt Romney.
Of the 1,517 respondents—representing about 7.2 percent of Harvard’s student body—53.5 percent identified themselves as Democrats, 11.6 percent identified as Republicans, and 33.6 percent said that they are independents.
COLLEGE, NOT THE ELECTORAL KIND
Harvard’s state-by-state map looks quite different than the image that will show up on television on Tuesday night. Students from every state but Idaho and North Dakota participated in the poll, and Obama won in all but five.
Romney took Indiana, Kansas, and Mississippi. And despite the heavy advantage Obama clearly carries among Harvard students, swing states were still swing states. Just like in the recent nationwide polls, New Hampshire and New Mexico proved highly competitive—ties in The Crimson’s poll. The results from Florida and Ohio were also very close, although Obama was favored in each state.
If the election were to be determined by Harvard students, Obama would win the election with 496 votes in the Electoral College.
The results suggest that Harvard students are considerably more liberal than the nation at large. For example, 78.5 percent of respondents from Massachusetts favored Obama—more than 20 percent greater than the current poll numbers coming from the state, which show Obama at about 57 percent.
The Crimson poll’s state-by-state results skewed significantly more liberal in some cases; for example, Obama won Texas with 67 percent of the vote, though Texas is a dark red state which Romney will most certainly win.
WHAT’S YOUR ISSUE?
Fifty percent of respondents selected the economy as the issue that mattered most to them in this election, aligning with current UGov tracking polls, in which 47 percent of nationwide respondents ranked the economy as the number one issue.
The issue of second importance in Harvard students’ eyes was health care, also matching up with national averages. These first two were followed by foreign policy at 9 percent and energy and the environment and abortion, both at 7 percent. The general public indicated less concern with all of those issues—3.7 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.
Government professor Ryan D. Enos, who teaches a course on political psychology, said the economy is almost always the top issue in any poll, but that the numbers in The Crimson’s and UGov’s surveys may not line up completely because the two polls did not offer exactly the same set of choices to respondents.
The poll also questioned students about two initiatives on the Massachusetts ballot this year, which would legalize physician-assisted suicide and medical marijuana dispensation.
In response to Question 2 on the ballot, concerning whether a doctor should be permitted to prescribe medication to end a patient’s life, 75 percent of the students said that they would support the measure. On Question 3 on medical marijuana, 82 percent said that they believed that medical marijuana should be legalized.
POLITICAL SCIENCE
Students at the College, the Law School and the Graduate School of Design submitted the most responses to the online poll, which was open to students last week. Of those schools, the Graduate School of Design was the most liberal leaning, with 88 percent in favor of Obama. At the Law School, 79 percent supported Obama, and at the College, where more than 10 percent of the student body took the survey, 73 percent favored the President.
While the Law School and the College answered similarly in some respects, Law School students showed significantly greater support for Elizabeth Warren, a professor at the Law School, in her Senate race against Republican incumbent Scott Brown. At the Law School, 81.5 percent said that they would vote for the professor; in the College, Warren received 74 percent of the votes.
Among the concentrations in the College, economics and philosophy students were the most conservative; those concentrators were nearly evenly split between supporting Obama and Romney.
Government professor Arthur P. Spirling, who teaches questions on political science research methods, questioned whether that phenomenon sprung from selection or treatment. Does studying economics or philosophy make a student conservative or do more conservative students choose to study economics and philosophy?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Inherently, every season has a story arc. And the Harvard football team’s 2012 campaign is no exception.
The story began on Sept. 15 with Harvard’s 28-13 win over San Diego. It picked up steam as the Crimson took down opponent after opponent to extend its nation-best winning streak to 14 games. And then, the huge, unexpected twist came with the shocking 39-34 loss to Princeton. Now, with two weeks left in the season, we’re barreling towards that climactic finish.
So what was Saturday’s game against Columbia? Where does it fit in that dramatic structure?
Simple: it was sheer comic relief.
In the biggest blowout of the Tim Murphy era, Harvard pulled off an astounding 69-0 walloping of Columbia.
One spread coming into the contest was 30 points. Yet somehow, someway, Harvard more than doubled it.
On Saturday, Columbia couldn’t walk and chew gum at the same time, let alone coordinate any sort of offense or defense. You know those scenes in movies where you’re almost too embarrassed to watch? That was all 60 minutes of play.
Even Harvard coach Tim Murphy thought things got a bit out of hand and in the press conference said he “felt badly” the team scored as many points as it did.
It was, as the Columbia radio announcers said behind me during the game, “like David versus Goliath, except David forgot his slingshot.” Yes, in that classic favorite vs. underdog matchup, the bully versus the fat kid, it ended just as you expected. Only worse.
It made Reagan vs. Mondale look like a down-to-the-wire classic, made Secretariat’s performance at the Belmont look like a photo finish.
The numbers are dizzying. The most points scored by any Crimson team since 1946. Thirty-five points in the second quarter, a program record. The list goes on, and on, and on.
On the other side of the ball, Harvard was just as dominant. Columbia was held to 10 or fewer total yards of offense in two separate quarters, and three of those second-quarter touchdowns came on turnovers. On the day, the Lions netted -19 rushing yards and allowed eight sacks for 53 yards.
But this wasn’t a one-sided Crimson blitzkrieg simply because Harvard has a deep, talented squad. It’s also because Columbia doesn’t.
Even Murphy, usually reserved in comparing teams to one another, acknowledged that, when asked whether this was his team’s best performance of the season.
“It’s hard to evaluate simply because they’re not in the same level of development right now—this particular Columbia team—as we have been,” Murphy said. “It’s a team we should have beat, and obviously we played well and beat them pretty well, but I think you save those types of accolades or judgments for the very best teams in our league. And they will be at some point, but they’re not now.”
Saturday was a big day for Murphy beyond his team’s record-breaking performance on the field. He is now tied with long-time Dartmouth coach Bob Blackman for fourth on the all-time Ivy League wins list. More than that, the victory gave Harvard its seventh win—now, under Murphy, the Crimson has done at least that in each of the team’s last 12 seasons.
But beyond Murphy, beyond the eye-popping 69 points posted on the scoreboard that warmed the hearts of each and every middle schooler in the audience, the win was critical to Harvard’s title chances. After Penn upset Princeton on Saturday, 28-21, the Crimson once again completely controls its own destiny in Ivy League play. Should the team win out, then Harvard will have repeated as the sole Ivy champion. End of story.
And so by definition, our story’s climax is shaping up to be next week at Penn’s Franklin Field, where the two league leaders—who between them, have won at least a share of each of the last five titles—face off in what should prove to be a de facto Ivy League championship. The winner of that game likely secures the crown by itself.
But what about Yale, you ask? If Harvard wins next Saturday, couldn’t the Bulldogs unseat Harvard in The Game?
Mathematically, I guess, it could happen. I mean, stranger things have occurred.
But last week, albeit on the team’s fourth-string quarterback, Yale somehow, inexplicably lost to Columbia. So do the Bulldogs have much of a shot? You do the math.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the first 89 minutes and 30 seconds, Saturday’s game at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium between the Harvard women’s soccer team (9-5-3, 3-3-1 Ivy) and Columbia (6-9-1, 2-4-1) stood knotted at 0-0. But as fans prepared for overtime, freshman Brooke Dickens had other ideas.
Taking a cross from senior Aisha Price outside the penalty box, Dickens tapped the ball and sprinted past the outstretched arms of Lions goalkeeper Grace Redmon, heading the ball off the post and into the right corner of the net with five seconds to go.
Dickens threw up her arms in celebration as the bench erupted with cheers and yells. When the clock finally struck zero, with Crimson goalkeeper Bethany Kanten cradling the ball in her hands, the team charged the field and celebrated.
“The plan wasn’t to go into overtime; it was to score in regulation and win the game,” Dickens said. “I knew that the clock was winding down and Aisha saw me waiting for the ball, and she found me and the ball found the back of the net. It’s definitely a lot more pressure at the end of the game because you know you can’t play slowly and relax, and you just have to keep pressuring the other teams.”
Crimson forward Peyton Johnson compared the final play to a Hail Mary with the team playing the ball into the middle of the penalty box and hoping for the best.
“You have one play left in the game, and your only hope is that it finds the back of the net,” the junior co-captain said. “It was a great pass by Aisha and a perfectly timed run by Brooke. It took a lot of courage to put her head in there for the team, and it was remarkable.”
When the clock began to wind down, Johnson said that Harvard had to strike a balance between aggressive and conservative play. While the team did not want to give up a goal, according to Johnson, it didn’t want to miss opportunities on the other end.
“We were deep in our half [when the final minute started],” Johnson said. “That’s when your first motivation is to get it out of their danger zone. Once we find it on the other half, it becomes all forces go and everyone begins to pressure and get more aggressive.”
The group of six seniors—goalkeeper Alexandra Millet, defenders Taryn Kurcz and Catherine Coppinger, who are both Crimson sports executives, and midfielders Alicia Johnson, Alexandra Conigliaro, and Price—led the Crimson to 39 wins over their four seasons with the team. Harvard had 19 wins over Ivy League foes over that time and claimed two Ancient Eight championships, most recently last season. According to Dickens, it was important that the team was able to send its seniors out with a win on Senior Day.
“It’s the last time that some of our girls will ever play for Harvard,” Dickens said. “We love them so much and it’s definitely an emotional time because we are working as hard as we can for them to make this moment great for them. We wanted to end the season with a bang and make their last game a good memory.”
The Crimson totaled 18 shots—11 coming in the second half. But Columbia matched Harvard throughout the majority of the game denying the Crimson many scoring chances. In one sequence in the 55th minute, Redmon saved three separate shots from Harvard players, finally clearing the ball after a series of deflections.
The teams briefly stopped play in the 62nd minute to allow referees to clear out a group of rowdy Crimson fans from behind the Columbia goal, whose raucous heckling was deemed targeted at an individual player—Redmon—prompting the referees to relocate the fans.
Harvard finished the season fourth in the Ivy league and struggled through an early stretch of the season before finishing 6-2-2 in their last 10 games. Over that span, Harvard gave up over one goal only twice (a 4-1 loss to Princeton and a 2-0 defeat against Dartmouth) and had five shutouts over that same span.
The team outscored its opponents 27-23 over the course of the year, led by sophomore forward Meg Casscells-Hamby’s six goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a closely contested game, the Harvard field hockey team was unable to ride its second-half momentum to victory, losing, 3-2, to Columbia on Senior Day at Jordan Field.
The Lions (9-8, 4-3 Ivy) dominated the first half, scoring two goals to the Crimson’s zero. Although Harvard (3-13, 1-6) controlled the tempo for most of the final period, the team could not muster enough offense to erase the deficit.
Despite the loss, the second-half surge was a positive sign for the Crimson, which has struggled throughout the season and finished tied for last in the Ivy League.
“I was really excited with the way we played the second half,” co-captain midfielder Kim Goh said. “We knew coming in that we could compete with Columbia. In the first half, we hung on, but I don’t think we showed nearly as much of what we can do. We fixed a lot of things [in the second half], we played like we believed in ourselves, and it really showed.”
Both of Columbia’s first-half goals resulted from rebounds off co-captain goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos. Following a corner in the 13th minute of play, Tassopoulos dove to stop a shot but left the cage wide open for Lions’ senior back Katie DeSandis to punch in the deflection.
Columbia forward Gabby Kozlowski—who ranks fourth in the Ivy League in goals—netted her 10th tally of the season toward the end of the half when she pounced on a loose ball in the circle and sent it past a cluster of Harvard defenders.
Tassopoulos posted three saves in her final game in a Harvard uniform. The co-captain is one of only three Crimson goalies to reach 500 saves in the history of the program.
“[Tassopoulos] has been tremendous her whole career here, and it’s unfortunate we have to say goodbye to her after one year of me coaching here,” said Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “She has made tremendous saves over the last couple of games and today as well. She showed up big for the team.”
Harvard struck first in the second half, when a goal from sophomore forward Noel Painter brought the Crimson within one.
Freshman back Elizabeth Jacobson stole the ball close to midfield, dribbled all the way to the net, and passed to Painter who sent a shot into the open cage.
Columbia made it 3-1 in the 61st minute when DeSandis unleashed an attempt from the right side of the circle that snuck past Tassopoulos. The goal was DeSandis’ second on the game.
It looked as if Harvard would go away without a fight until—in the final minute of play—senior forward Katelin Wahl took a pass from Painter on the right side of the circle and scored. Although the goal energized the crowd it ultimately came too late.
“I think we started to believe a little too late,” Herwaarden said. “In the first half, we were sort of holding back and being more careful, and we gave Columbia too much time and too much room to play the game. In the second half, I think we focused more on what we are capable of and not as much what they can do, and I think that worked out very well for us.”
Most of the action in the first half took place on the Crimson side of the field, as Columbia maintained possession and outshot Harvard, 9-4. But in the second half, the Crimson resembled an entirely different team, totaling seven shots to the Lions’ three.
Several times in the final period, Harvard found itself with a numbers advantage on the fastbreak but could not muster the finishing strike.
“It comes down to scoring goals, and right now we need four or five opportunities to score a goal,” Herwaarden said. “They need maybe two or three to score a goal, and that’s kind of been the story of our season. That’s something we need to change.”
For the five Crimson seniors, Saturday’s loss was certainly a bittersweet moment. Although the season was not filled with many wins and ended with a tough loss, seniors Tassopoulos, Goh, Wahl, Emma Keller, and Molly Stansik nevertheless say they had a productive experience as part of the team.
“It’s not just growing as a field hockey player, you grow because you learn how to really invest yourself in something,” Goh said. “That’s what it’s given me, is learning how to be okay with putting everything on the line.”

In dominant back-to-back performances, the Harvard women’s hockey team (4-0-0, 4-0-0 ECAC) extended its season-opening winning streak with road victories against Brown and Yale. In both meetings, the Crimson kept most of the action on its opponents’ side of the red line, outshooting the Bears and the Bulldogs by an aggregate margin of 86-17 without surrendering a goal.
“We went into [the weekend] knowing what we needed to do,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “Our team is just really meshing this year. [There is] a lot of early-season excitement.”
While the defenders and goaltenders did their part to keep the puck out of the net, co-captain Jillian Dempsey’s five points on the weekend propelled the Crimson offense.
“We’re coming out playing hungry,” Dempsey said of her team’s efforts. “This weekend especially, we got a lot of shots towards the net. We were facing some really solid goaltending. Offensively, we were just trying to get in the goalie’s face [and] put pucks on net. It worked out well.”
HARVARD 4, YALE 0
A strong offensive presence helped Harvard past the Bulldogs (1-5-0, 1-3-0) on Saturday.
“We’ve really been working on our systems and playing in such a way that it’s hard for these teams to get past us in the offensive zone,” Fry said. “We know that we are offensively strong, and we’re going to do everything we can in order to keep it in that end.”
On the night, the Crimson recorded 48 shots on net compared to Yale’s 12.
A Bulldog cross-checking infraction led to a power play opportunity in the middle of the first for Harvard. Capitalizing on the advantage, Dempsey scored at 11:17 in the first period off an assist from sophomore defender Sarah Edney and Fry.
Fry found the back of the net just over three minutes later off a 3-on-1 breakaway, giving the Crimson a 2-0 advantage at the end of the first period.
After a scoreless second period, Edney registered her third consecutive assist of the night when she fed the puck to senior defenseman Hilary Hayssen, who scored 8:53 minutes into the third period.
Senior forward Kaitlin Spurling registered an unassisted goal just over three minutes later, as Harvard went on to a convincing 4-0 win.
“Spurling had a beautiful goal against Yale,” co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “But her strength was in showing up all over the ice. She was a huge contributor this weekend.”
Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer minded the net all night for the Crimson. She stopped all 12 shots, anchoring the team’s solid defensive effort. Having only surrendered one goal on the season, Maschmeyer currently boasts a .966 save percentage.
“Defensively, [our goalies] have been solid between the pipes,” Dempsey said. “There’s nothing better than knowing you can rely on phenomenal goaltending.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 0
Harvard got off to a quick start against the Bears on Friday (1-3-0, 1-3-0) and never looked back.
Less than 10 minutes into the first period, forward Kalley Armstrong found the back of the net, registering her first goal of the season.
“We played really well offensively,” Bellamy said. “We didn’t give up many shots, but we also took a lot of shots.”
The Crimson sustained pressure right from the start of the second period, keeping possession of the puck on Brown’s side of the ice for the first five minutes. Harvard’s top line converted less than three minutes into the period, when Dempsey found the back of the net, giving Harvard a 2-0 lead.
On the other end of the ice, Bellamy did not see much action, as the Bears only registered five shots on goal all night. The senior has had the best start of her career with the Crimson so far this season, recording shutouts in her first two matchups.
One of the night’s few threats on Harvard’s own end of the ice came early when Brown freshman Emma Pearson’s shot ricocheted off the right goalpost.
“Our defense is playing really well, not letting a lot of shots through,” Fry said. “That’s a [big] reason [for our success].”
“Defensively, we are just shutting people down,” Demspey added.
Senior defender Kelsey Romatoski tacked on another goal for the Crimson halfway through the second period, when she slid the puck past the Bears’ goaltender Katie Jamieson.
The third period passed uneventfully, as the Harvard defense allowed only one shot on goal.
On the night, the Crimson outshot Brown, 38-5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the newest rowers to Radcliffe crew, the fall season could not have had a better start. After a decisive victory at the Head of the Housatonic on Oct. 6, the Black and White novice heavyweight boat took home another win at the Green Monster regatta on Saturday in Hanover, N.H., to remain perfect this season.
The Radcliffe lightweights took part in the same race, their first of the year, and edged out the other competing lightweight crew.
The Black and White crews highlighted the talents of freshmen this weekend. Of the nine women in the heavyweight boat, eight were freshmen, while the lightweight boat was made up entirely of freshmen.
“It felt really good for how much time we spent in the lineup,” said heavyweight freshman Erin Slatery, rowing in the eight seat. “We really executed our race plan, which was exciting especially for such a new crew, and it felt like everyone gave a great effort.”
The Green Monster, which opens the lightweight novice season and falls midway through the heavyweights’ novice season between the Head of the Housatonic and the Foot of the Charles, featured races between novice boats from schools in the Northeast, including Ivy rival Dartmouth, the host school.
“I think it’s really important to note the level of competition that shows up at that race,” said assistant heavyweight coach Wendy Wilbur. “It’s always really great competition from Dartmouth, Boston College, and UMass specifically.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe heavyweights rowed the three-mile race in 16:36 to take first place out of 15 crews by a commanding 14-second margin. The Big Green entry came in second at 16:50, while Boston College boats took third and fourth, clocking in at 17:08 and 17:27, respectively.
With the win, the Black and White heavyweights remained unbeaten on the year.
“I think [being undefeated] just shows the strength of our team,” Wilbur said. “Our varsity team is doing a really great job being the leaders, and I think the freshman and novice groups are doing just a great job latching onto the atmosphere of the boat house and the goals of the team and being backups to those strong leaders on the varsity end.”
“We have one more novice race, so our goal for the season as novice is to stay undefeated,” added freshman Lauren Tracey, rowing in the seven seat. “This was a good stepping stone.”
Under what Slatery described as “perfect racing conditions,” the Big Green’s boat began the head race 15 seconds ahead of Radcliffe’s boat due to a staggered start, but throughout the course, the Black and White entry gained on Dartmouth’s crew.
“During the race, we moved up on the other boats, so we had a feeling that we won, but it was really different to hear that we won,” Tracey said. “We caught up to [Dartmouth] by the end of the race, and we almost passed them, so it was a fun race.”
The boat that traveled to race on the Connecticut River was a mix of both recruits and walk-ons, leading to an interesting combination of rowers in the Radcliffe heavyweight crew.
“We’re all really excited not only about the recruited freshmen we have this year but also the pool of walk-ons,” Slatery said. “We have some upperclassmen walk-ons, so we’re doing really great things—we also have some really strong athletic freshmen who are trying out the sport.”
Boston College took first overall in the team competition, with a combined time of 34:35, to win the trophy filled with Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The novice lightweight crew, rowing alongside the heavyweights, took ninth overall with a time of 18:32. The Black and White beat out the one other lightweight boat in the race—MIT’s crew, which posted a time of 19:00 to finish in 10th.
“I think they did a really good job,” said assistant lightweight coach Lauren Fisher. “They handled their first race really well, and they were really aggressive down the race the whole way, and they beat the other lightweight team that they were up against. That was the result that we were looking for.”
Despite rowing with the heavyweights, the lightweights still managed to post a solid showing, beating out five of the heavyweight teams.
“When you’re comparing heavyweights and lightweights to each other, it’s difficult because the difference is probably on average about 30-ish pounds per crew member,” Wilbur said. “It’s difficult for them to compete with the heavier bodies, but I think they did a really good job in a race against heavyweights.”
The Harvard novice lightweight men were also in action and fared well in the Green Monster, taking second overall in the team competition with a combined time of 30:54, second only to the heavyweight teams from Trinity, which posted a combined time of 30:27. The Crimson novice heavyweights placed seventh out of the field of eight with a combined time of 33:10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Harvard men’s basketball team received unprecedented television coverage as current and former (see: Jeremy Lin) players proved that they could ball.
Whether the Crimson takes a step backwards or builds on last season’s success remains to be seen. What is certain, though, is that fans will see even more of Harvard basketball on the tube.
Right now, the Crimson is slated to play at least fourteen games on television, the most in program history.  Most of the games will appear on NBC Sports Network and ESPN.
These days, it is difficult to come across a ticket for one of the 2,050 seats in Lavietes Pavilion.  Harvard’s matchup against rival Princeton is already sold out, and it will not be the last. Fortunately, fans will have the opportunity to watch sold-out games on television.
The expanded coverage gives Coach Tommy Amaker another resource in the recruiting game.  Prized recruits will be able to play in front of local and national audiences, a rarity in the Ivy League.
NBC Sports Network—formerly known as Versus—will cover six games as part of its network deal with the Ancient Eight. The first game will be televised on November 20, when the Harvard squad travels to St. Joseph’s.
ESPN, the biggest and most powerful network in sports television, will broadcast four games. The network will cover the Crimson’s second game, a home contest against UMass on November 9, as part of its college basketball Tip-Off Marathon. Harvard’s contests against Boston College, Saint Mary’s (California), and Princeton will also be televised by ESPN.
Excluding Jeremy Lin’s epic performance at Madison Square Garden, the Crimson has a history of disappointing performances on ESPN.  Harvard lost three out of the four games that ESPN televised last season.
Although the Crimson dominated its Ancient Eight opponents throughout the season, the team suffered its only conference losses of the season while playing on ESPN.  On February 11, Princeton defeated Harvard on ESPNU and ESPN3.com. The curse of ESPN3 reared its head two weeks later when Penn stunned the Ivy-League favorites, 55-54.
The Crimson split its out-of-conference games on the network, losing to UCONN on December 2 but defeating Boston College on December 29. Harvard held a surprising two-point lead at halftime against the defending champion Huskies before Connecticut’s Jeremy Lamb—a future NBA teammate of Lin—went off in the second half.  The Crimson would go on to lose the program’s first game on ESPN2, 67-53.
How will Harvard perform while the nation is watching?  Just turn on the TV and find out.

The Harvard football team's 69-0 victory over the Columbia Lions wasn't pretty. Harvard pulled many of its best players after the half and, in the fourth quarter, played fourth-string running back Damani K. Wilson '14. He ran for 121 yards and two touchdowns. However, among the carnage lie plenty of humorous subplots.
 
1. Every football game, Harvard cheerleaders do pushups equal to the number of points the Crimson has after every score. On Saturday, they did 339 pushups—Flyby suspects they got a better workout than the Columbia offense and put forth more effort than the Columbia defense.
 
2. It was only at the beginning of this year that Columbia equated Harvard to the "bad guy" of the Ivy League, comparing the Crimson to Lord Voldemort and the Joker. But, Flyby wonders, shouldn't a nemesis at least be competitive?
 
3. The maligned Lions, a favorite punching bag of Crimson executive Alexander Koenig, have been the subject of continued jibes by The Crimson's sporting staff (notably here and here). Columbia's newspaper responded to Koenig's attacks viciously, but Koenig has the last laugh here.
 
4. To say that Columbia sucked is juvenile, but swallowing the sour taste of losing by 69 could not have been easy.
 
5. One last thing to keep in mind: Columbia beat Yale last weekend. Flyby is looking forward to The Game.

Jill E. Stein '73 turns off her radio and climbs down from her headquarters. The treehouse behind her, she knocks on the back door of a Toyota Prius.
 
-Cheri, have we won yet?
-Well, Jill, um, I've, um, been checking. [She quickly opens her computer.] It's close—the Republicans and Democrats are neck and neck.
-And the Green Party? How is the Green Party doing?
-Well, Jill, we don't have any electoral votes. Not that we expected any. This is probably not our year.
-Not even one?
-No. We almost got three percent of the vote in Rhode Island, though. If only more of the environmentally-conscious pacifists who like taxes got out to vote today. That would have done the trick.
-Next time, Cheri. Next time.
-Yes, we will run again. As Nader has shown, the race never ends.
-I can see it now. Jill Stein 2016: The President of the Future. My tagline: ‘It's okay, I’m a doctor.’
-You used that one this time around.
-Whatever. It's really good. Let's get out of here.
[Cheri begins to start the car.]
-Stop! Drive? We can’t use gas. We will stand true to our party. [She motions to a horse-drawn carriage behind them.]
-Naturally. But where are we going?
-Well, it's like when we fought to get into the debates—
-But didn't we get arrested?
-We're going to take the White House by storm. We're going to do what’s right for America.

In response to The Crimson Editorial Board's endorsement of President Barack Obama, Flyby decided to look into trends among college paper presidential endorsements.
 
The Crimson endorsed Obama last Monday. On Tuesday, the Yale Daily News also threw their support behind the president. (Note: Both The Crimson and the YDN start their editorials with "Four years ago..." Flyby is calling copy-cat.) Other Ivy League paper endorsements of Obama have come from The Columbia Spectator, The Brown Daily Herald, and The Daily Princetonian.
 
Obama support has also poured in from other local schools like Tufts and Brandeis, California schools like UC Berkley and UCLA, and a barrage of other papers from our peers around the country, including those in swing states, like the University of Iowa's Daily Iowan, and even red states, like West Virginia University's Daily Athenaeum.
 
In an attempt to write a balanced blog post, Flyby ransacked the internet to find college papers that had endorsed Romney. Despite investigating thirty-plus colleges and Wikipedia's page on this issue, we were unsuccessful in finding even a single one.
 
The Ohio State University Lantern did explicitly say that they will not endorse either candidate. The Georgetown Voice endorsed Jill Stein.

Once again, Yalies have fallen short of Harvard standards. According to an article in The Yale Daily News, the Yale Licensing Office has rejected Yale's Freshman Class Council's shirt design for The Game based on "Harvard's criteria."
The front of the shirt depicts an altered Harvard logo with the word "Cheaters," referencing the cheating scandal that rocked Harvard at the beginning of the school year. The back reads "Putting the 'Veritas' in: Lux et Veritas."
According to Yale's Freshman Class Council President William Sadock '16, quoted in the YDN article, the design was chosen because it is a "recognizable scandal at Harvard that informed Yalies would understand." Although the back of the shirt may not have to change, the council will have to consider the other design options for the front.
Some Harvardians are less than impressed with Yale's feeble attempts to poke fun at Harvard.
"It's just not that creative," said John L. Chipoco-Campoverde '16.
Ironically, Yale students tried to mock our cheating scandal by plagiarizing our logo. Looks as though Yale hasn't learned from our mistakes.

Chinese history professor Michael Puett does it again. Just last month, Puett gave his Ethical Reasoning 18: "Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory" class a break from lectures, assignments, and section during the week his students had a paper due.
In an email to his class, Puett apologized for ending his lecture five minutes after the hour on Monday, Nov. 5. "Only after I finished the lecture did I realize that the clock in Sanders was five minutes slow," he wrote. "...I'm so sorry!  I will be sure to check the accuracy of the clock before each lecture from now on!"
Puett is making sure his students can take full advantage of Harvard time. Five minutes may seem trivial, but the man is an ethics professor after all.
