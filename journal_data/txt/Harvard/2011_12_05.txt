After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Trust me, there are only three ways a man can go. He can let the status quo defeat him...” a German teenager drawls, “He can rock the boat ... and be expelled. Or he can bide his time, and let the System work for him—like me.” This line from Duncan Sheik's and Steven Stater’s “Spring Awakening” not only applies to the trajectories of the characters in Frank Wedekind's original 1892 play, but also aptly describes the philosophy of the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of the musical. The show, directed by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12 and Ryan P. Halprin ’12 and running from November 30 to December 5, falters due to a lack of chemistry between the main pairing, and it unsuccessfully attempts to “rock the boat” by staging the play at OBERON. But the musical is redeemed by relying on the mainstays of traditional theater: the quality of the individual acting, the implementation of the score, and the choreography.
“Spring Awakening” chronicles the blossoming of a group of 19th-century German youths by focusing on budding intellectual force Melchior Gabor (Jonathan K. Stevens ’14) and his experimentation with the flowering yet sexually naïve Wendla Bergmann (Anna J. Mitran ’13). Stevens embodies the handsome, seemingly secure Melchior with skill; he slips into diary diatribes about the bourgeoisie and adult society with passion and angst. Similarly, Mitran plays Wendla with appropriate wide-eyed curiosity and sadness, particularly during “Mama who Bore me,” an appeal for education about her sexuality. However, all of the tension built up by the angst-ridden Stevens and Mitran about their respective woes goes nowhere during their duets. At the end of the first act, when Stevens and Mitran have sex to the incredibly hopeful “I Believe,” both seem to be in a sort of autopilot that diminishes the sense of awakening that is meant to characterize the scene.
Part of the difficulty in creating chemistry might be explained by the show's intricate staging plans, which prove burdensome to implement. OBERON prides itself on being a venue that lends itself to innovative performances, but the space cannot create a more immersive experience when lighting and sound falter. The actors' microphones fail to turn on when they begin to sing at least two dozen times during the performance, and their initial lighting is similarly lacking. These missteps create a confused, swiveling audience who can’t hear voices from characters they see and can’t see characters whose voices they hear. Alongside these blunders, actors repeatedly and gratuitously climb up and down the OBERON's various staircases—a habit that becomes especially frustrating when characters trip on blocks or run out of breath by the time they reach their destinations. There is a sense that the actors are constantly asking themselves where they have to be at the moment.
However, despite these flaws, “Spring Awakening” has a slew of excellent scenes—notably Moritz Stiefel’s (Noah J. Madoff ’12) bitter post-school-expulsion number “I Don’t Do Sadness” coupled with the reply and duet of Moritz’s could-have-been love interest and bohemian artist Ilse (Amelia H. Ross ’14) in “Blue Wind.” Likewise, Ernst (Patrick J. Wicker '13) and Hanschen (Peter H. Manges '15) demonstrate excellent chemistry in their scene together, in which a chaste kiss somehow manages to say more than the minutes of fondling earlier in the play.
Moreover, the musical and vocal prowess of the company is commendable. When unmarred by microphone malfunctions, the songs are executed with passion and cohesion. The group numbers, especially “The Bitch of Living,” and “Totally Fucked,” draw inspiration from the original staging of the musical, but also showcase Halprin’s own choreography. When the cast is not hindered by odd staging they make effective use of the space, as students bound on and off the stage with infectious enthusiasm.
The set and costume design of the show is also very well thought out. All of the characters are in matching 19th-century suits and old-fashioned dresses, which highlight how the characters are expected to conform to the outdated and conservative views of their parents.
Despite technical failures and an unfortunate lack of chemistry between its leads, “Awakening” impresses with its energetic execution of the music and provocative choreography. “Spring Awakening” doesn’t really “rock the boat,” but the quality of the individual actors' performances still provides for a fulfilling musical experience.

Those members of Occupy Harvard who tried to disrupt the Goldman Sachs information session should be commended. Rather than singling Goldman out, Occupy Harvard has simply targeted the bank as one of many offenders from a financial sector that severely damaged the United   States economy. This was not an effort to sway students to work for J.P. Morgan. Indeed, this action represents the best strategy for Occupy Harvard, that is, to disrupt the corporate recruiting process as a whole. This is a campaign where they might have a real impact. Frankly, it is a far better strategy than simply occupying the yard with tents, which draws valuable attention to the movement but cannot be an end in itself. There is nothing “unsavory” about encouraging Harvard graduates to avoid Wall Street. Occupy Harvard is a student branch of the broader Occupy movement, and thus should be concerned about the jobs students take upon graduation. Furthermore, the presence of large investment banks and consulting firms at the Office of Career Services has created a strong anti-intellectual current that threatens Harvard’s academic mission. Faculty and students should applaud those Occupiers who, whether knowingly or not, are defending the university project, even as they skip class to join in a protest movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every ten years—when state legislatures redraw their congressional districts—there are bound to be political casualties. In Massachusetts, where the only thing more Democratic than the federal delegation is the state house, there have been no controversial partisan battles of the kind found this year in Maine or Texas over this redrawing. There are already noticeable if not momentous changes with this year’s map—namely, that it creates the first-ever majority-minority district in Massachusetts’s history (the same one in which Harvard happens to be located). Yet, for all the liberal sentiment that went into this year’s redistricting plan, it claimed as its first victim a hero to America’s progressives: Barney Frank ’61-’62. Frank announced his retirement last week, citing the drastic change in his district’s makeup and the likelihood of a harder-than-expected reelection battle.
We lament the loss of Frank as a legislator and a top-flight public figure. His distinguished career in Congress was a brilliant example of what an ambitious and passionate Harvard graduate can accomplish, and his career should serve as an inspiration for all politically minded young people.
Having spent 30 years in Congress, Frank accumulated an impressive list of legislative accomplishments, the most recent addition being the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed new regulations on the financial sector. Locally, Frank was known for his unwavering commitment to his constituents, not least the fishermen of the port city of New Bedford. His advocacy for this downtrodden industry occasionally put him at odds with his fellow liberals over environmental concerns, but it was the loyalty he displayed to them that led many Massachusetts fishermen to refer to his retirement as “disastrous.” Frank became renowned for the personal touch he brought to politics, often stepping in to help constituents whose concerns had been lost in the cracks of bureaucracy. His active advocacy for his district gave meaning to the slogan that carried him through many a campaign: “Barney Frank, who else?” Many residents of Frank’s district will have a hard time imagining who might be able to fill the gigantic shoes he’s leaving behind.
Nationally, Frank was known for his incisive wit and steadfast allegiance to liberal causes. Although he is one of the nation’s most prominent Democrats, Frank has always been allied more closely to progressive principle than to party, breaking with fellow Democrats to support Republican Edward W. Brooke III for Senate in 1978. His unique character and remarkable sense of humor carried through to the present. Who can forget his infamous retort to Tea Party protestors at a 2009 town-hall meeting: “On what planet do you spend most of your time?”
Frank also notably holds the important distinction of being the first openly gay representative in the House. As many readers know and have witnessed, this particular characteristic has brought him undue disrespect from his colleagues over the years: In 1995, the second-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, Richard K. Armey, used an anti-gay slur in reference to Frank. His openness with his sexual orientation—albeit after years of staying in the closet—remains a breath of fresh air in an age when so many politicians hide their true sexual identities while spending years spouting homophobic vitriol.
Frank spent his career advocating for his constituents, championing liberal causes, and imbuing national discourse with a healthy dose of wry humor. His constituents will not be the only people to feel a void in his absence—the nation is losing a political figure worthy of true praise. Students here and everywhere should see Frank as an example of what you can accomplish when you are determined, principled, and true to yourself. He will be missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I began at Harvard this fall, I wasn’t like a lot of the other freshmen. I wasn’t my high school valedictorian. I hadn’t invented anything, let alone Facebook, although I spend way too much time on it. I never aspired to be president but thought it would be cool to have a future president as my roommate. I hadn’t spent the last 19 years dreaming about going to Harvard. In fact, all I really hoped for was to get through middle school. Although I have become a decent diver, I didn’t win—or even place—in my first U.S. diving competition; in fact, I had the dubious distinction of coming in dead last. Unlike my classmates and teammates who may have spent much of their youth trying to stand out, I spent most of mine trying to fit in. An inventory of accomplishments is not what garnered me a coveted spot at Harvard or the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials in diving. Quite the opposite, a lengthy list of failures paved my way.
Just two weeks into kindergarten, my parents received “the call.”  My mother hung up the phone, looked at my father in bewilderment and asked, “Is it even possible to flunk out of kindergarten?” My teacher had told her that I needed to be reigned in, or else I was headed for major problems. The plan the following year was to enroll me in a private elementary school with a smaller class size, but I was rejected. My parents described me as “spirited,” but when my first grade Sunday School teacher told them I could no longer come to class without an adult accompanying me, they began to wonder. We moved to a new town when I was in second grade and my teacher raised concerns about passing me to third grade. By third grade I had so much difficulty keeping up that the principal told my parents it would be best to have me evaluated and repeat the third grade.
After extensive testing I was diagnosed with dyslexia, ADHD, and an expressive language disorder. For me it just confirmed that I was “insufficient” and was consistent with my report card much of the time. I was sent to a psychiatrist but refused to talk to him, so we played chess instead. Stalemate was a safe place for me, and the best thing about it was I couldn’t fail, even though I knew it was because I didn’t try. I was given no choice but to face my fear of reading and worked with specialists after school until I was a sophomore in high school. When I was younger, I hated looking out the window at the other kids on the playground because it frustrated me that I wasn’t like them. Now I see that I was actually given a gift and a chance to make a difference for other children who can’t seem to blend into society like everyone else.
Of all the interventions that tried to help me, in the end it was a sport that saved me. The summer I turned eight, my parents decided I should bounce off a diving board since I spent most of my childhood bouncing off walls. I was immediately hooked, and ultimately the sport taught me the rewards of resiliency, resolve, and focus. The challenge of diving is mental toughness and confidence. It does not matter if you are the best in practice if you cannot perform in front of an audience in complete silence. Diving is not a place where you can hide from your fears. That is the gift of the sport; it forces you to face your demons while the world watches. Eventually I taught myself through innumerable hours and countless failures that you will succeed only if you stare failure in the face and are not afraid. After a few years I had dominated my local competition and my 10-year trek toward the Olympic Trials began. Ultimately, the confidence I gained from diving translated into academic success when, as a boy who couldn’t read until third grade, I got near perfect standardized scores as I applied to college.
I never really understood the motivational mug that says, “What would you attempt to do if you thought you could not fail?” I live by my own standard: “What will you do when you know you can fail?” I have come to appreciate that the greatest gains come from going for the goals you convince yourself are impossible. Theodore Roosevelt said it perfectly; “…the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; who fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.”
Michael J Mosca ’15 lives in Hurlbut Hall. He is a potential member of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Diving Team and broke the Harvard Men's Swimming and Diving record at his first Ivy League competition this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You can’t blame the Mayans for being a year off in predicting the end of days; how could they have anticipated the invention of the Hummer?
By all accounts, 2011 has shown some serious apocalyptic murmurs. Earthquakes and Irene jarring New England, tornadoes battering 21 states, two major rivers flooding, droughts parching the Southwest, and huge blizzards engulfing the Midwest and Northeast. And that’s just America—let’s not forget the Japanese tsunami that instigated the Fukushima crisis, the earthquakes that devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, and the famine that afflicted three quarters of Somalians. It’s hard to deny that the Earth is going haywire in a big way. This year has been by far the most expensive with respect to natural disaster damage in history.
The scientific credibility of global warming is solid and has been argued to death, so I will not attempt to refute the corporate-sponsored muckraking campaign aimed at discrediting it. But keep in mind that skeptics of climate change argue that the Earth undergoes natural temperature changes and that humans have nothing to do with any current shifts. If this is indeed a natural epochal shift, the good news is that the Earth will survive. The bad news is that we won’t. Let’s hope that this claim isn’t true, since it would mean that the planet is going to murder our species slowly and there’s nothing we can do about it.
Maybe it’s time we take the hint that a dark storm is brewing. If greenhouse gases are destabilizing natural climate patterns, then it is paramount that we reduce their emission. Joseph E. Aldy and Robert N. Stavins of the Harvard Kennedy School have published a new paper in “The Journal of Environment and Development” reiterating the critical point that the key to reducing carbon emissions needs to be market-based.
Even conservative economists such as Harvard’s own Martin Friedman and N. Gregory Mankiw support a straight-up carbon tax. The logic behind this type of tax, known as a Piguovian tax, is simple: raising the cost of a certain activity so that it accurately reflects its social cost will reduce its frequency to a more socially optimal level. Currently, the private cost of driving a Sports Utility Vehicle does not match the cost of its environmental damage.
Cap-and-trade, regarded as a more politically viable alternative, is a watered down and conciliatory solution that panders to corporations: Revenue raised by the disincentive goes to other corporations rather than to the government itself. But even that plan has become taboo among conservatives: likely nominee Mitt Romney has come under fire in the past few weeks for having policy advisors who so much as consider cap-and-trade.
Conservative opponents to a carbon tax argue that it would be distortionary and would retard economic growth. The tax would in fact be distortionary—that’s the point. But its distortionary effects would be positive, and, since the purpose of the tax is not to raise revenue but to correct a market perversion, the money acquired from it could be used to decrease painful taxation in other areas of the economy.
Critics also argue that, should we impose a carbon tax, we would shoot ourselves in the foot by pushing business to China and other emissions-happy competitors. In reality, China is more progressive than we are with respect to environmental taxation: China’s latest five-year-plan notes the need for a “green tax”, and the tax may see implementation within the next two years. The fact that China—China!—is outpacing us in environmental responsibility while realistic solutions are dead on arrival in our legislature is a national embarrassment.
Yes, there needs to be a global solution to carbon emissions, which means a global tax. Australia, Denmark, and Finland have already implemented carbon taxes, and the European Union, New Zealand, and California have created cap-and-trade systems. But America alone has the power to bring about true, comprehensive change. If we demonstrate that we are serious about reducing emissions via taxation, then others will follow. Climate change legislation, long considered the third pillar in Obama’s domestic reform troika along with health care and finance reform, has been brushed aside due to political realities. Carbon taxes can’t wait, and even Adam Smith would agree that correcting for negative externalities is not a violation of the free market.
Given the price we’ve been paying for ignoring the climate problem—at least $25 billion in this country this year alone—we don’t have time for the political stars to align. Unless we want 2012 to resemble a Hollywood blockbuster in havoc and budget, let’s get this tax passed.

Scientists from Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center successfully rebuilt diseased brain circuitry in mice by transplanting new neurons. The research, which was published in the November 25 issue of “Science,” indicates that the right type of neuron could successfully integrate and partially restore functionality to areas of the brain that naturally do not regenerate neurons themselves.
Carefully selected embryonic neurons were transplanted into mutant mice that lacked responsive leptin receptors in the hypothalamus, a condition generally leading to symptoms of extreme obesity.
“We asked whether simply adding some neurons carrying these leptin receptors specifically to the hypothalamus can restore feedback signaling to reduce body weight and restore normal glucose levels,” said Matthew Anderson, one of three senior authors of the paper and Harvard Medical School professor of pathology at Beth Israel Deaconess.
“The answer was yes, partially for obesity and more completely for glucose levels.”
The restoration of functionality in areas of such complex circuitry supports the idea that integration of specific neurons from stem cells could offer new therapeutic approaches for complicated conditions ranging from Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) and spinal cord injury to Parkinson’s disease.
Together with Anderson, the research was spearheaded by Jeffrey Flier, dean of Harvard Medical School, and Jeffrey Macklis, Harvard University professor of stem cell and regenerative biology and Harvard Medical School professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Artur Czupryn, a postdoctoral fellow in the Macklis laboratory, led the transplantation of new neurons into mice brain circuitry using ultrasound-guided technology. In this way, the researchers created a “chimeric” hypothalamus with both implanted and natural neurons in each treated mouse.
Maggie Chen, a postdoctoral fellow in the Flier laboratory, studied neurotransmitter signaling in these mice and analyzed their metabolic function.
Postdoctoral fellow Yu-Dong Zhou in the Anderson laboratory studied the electrophysiological function of four different neuron types generated from these transplanted neurons.
The results showed that the new neurons functionally integrated and communicated with the brain in both directions, essentially rewiring the hypothalamus to be receptive to leptin, as evidence by an approximately 30 percent drop in weight of the treated mice.
“With [the Flier lab’s] expertise in energy balance and leptin regulation, [the Anderson lab’s] expertise in electrophysiology, and the developmental regenerative expertise of my own lab, we could ask and answer questions that none of us alone could fully address,” Macklis said.
“If we can get the neurons and their development correct, they can rebuild circuitry in the post-developmental brain.”

A treatment regimen using a combination of two established drugs may alleviate radiation sickness, with potential application in nuclear emergencies, according to a study led by Harvard-affiliated researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Children’s Hospital of Boston.
The study, funded primarily by a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, found that the therapy was effective in mice even when administered up to a day after radiation exposure, giving it an enormous advantage over existing therapies. The drug combination thus has potential for use in response to emergencies like the recent Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.
The study was led by Harvard Medical School professors Eva C. Guinan and Ofer Levy. Mice exposed to radiation were administered a combination of the antibiotic fluoroquinolone and a synthetic version of the immune system protein BPI. While such radiation exposure would normally prove fatal for mice within thirty days, 80% of those treated with both agents were still alive a month later. Furthermore, the treatment was shown to be effective even if administered 24 hours after exposure.
“I remember that day, where we all wanted to crowd around the microscope together,” said Levy. “As a scientist, there’s a reflex to think ‘could this be too good to be true?’ But we’ve repeated these results with hundreds of mice and it’s highly statistically significant.”
The research, which represents five years of work, is the latest in the pair’s long-time collaboration. Levy came to Boston after training at the New York University research laboratory where BPI was discovered by Jerrold P. Weiss, one of the study’s co-authors, and Peter Elsbach. Soon after, Levy was introduced to Guinan and the pair began investigating the abnormal deficiency of BPI in transplant patients after being exposed to radiation.
“That made us believe that replacing BPI could decrease toxicity,” explains Guinan.
After publishing a study together, the pair were contacted by DARPA and asked to consider investigating radiation mitigation by applying their research on irradiated transplant patients.
“They proposed to give us a grant with the specific scope of looking at treatment effective at 24 hours after radiation exposure,” recalls Levy. “That’s a tall order.”
Although much remains to be done, the federal government could decide to stockpile the combination of agents for use in emergency situations. The drugs’ effectiveness 24 hours post-exposure is important from a practical standpoint, given the time it could take to deliver treatment in a mass casualty situation.
“It’s important to have things like this available worldwide where this might be necessary. Let’s cross our fingers and hope it won’t be necessary,” said Guinan.
Despite the study’s success, further research would be required to develop an effective treatment regime for radiation sickness.
“We have to remember to not get too impressed with a first study,” said Guinan. “We’re incredibly excited, but we also recognize this is a first step. There’s a lot of work left to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David J. Malan ’99, whose introductory computer course CS50 has seen enrollment more than triple since he took over four years ago, epitomizes Harvard’s recent emphasis on good teaching.
But that hasn’t guaranteed him a permanent job.
Even as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences embarks on a renewed effort to prioritize undergraduate education, it continues to operate under a system that looks beyond performance in the classroom to reward its faculty with academia’s ultimate form of job security: tenure.
Professors must demonstrate a combination of research and teaching to enter the tenure track, so for many instructors who, like Malan, spend most of their time teaching, tenure is not an option.
But these instructors also play an integral role in undergraduate education: according to an internal 2009 report on non-ladder faculty—those not on tenure track—recently obtained by The Crimson, this segment teaches nearly one-third of enrollments.
The document states that 61 percent of enrollments across FAS were taught by ladder faculty in 2008. Non-ladder faculty—which the report defines as lecturers, preceptors, and professors of the practice—taught 29 percent of enrollments, while the remaining 10 percent were taught by visiting faculty, professors emeriti, and professors from other Harvard schools.
While several non-tenure track professors, including Malan, declined to comment for this article, some ask how the University can retain its best teachers without giving them tenure.
AN ARMY OF NON-LADDER FACULTY
Non-ladder faculty members represent some of the biggest names on campus: Malan is a senior lecturer on a renewable five-year contract; Jeffrey A. Miron, who leads the second largest course in the Economics Department, is also a senior lecturer; and Robert A. Lue, who helped found and still teaches LS1a, is a professor of practice on a similar contract.
In the spring of 2009, economics professor James H. Stock and members of the Advisory Committee on Non-Ladder Appointments submitted the report on non-ladder faculty to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith that recognized the vital role that cadre of teachers plays on campus.
“Through the use of non-ladder faculty, the FAS is able to deploy its resources and instructors to their best comparative advantage,” the report states.
As the report notes, ladder faculty probably teach even less than the estimated 61 percent of enrollments. For example, tutorial classes often list a ladder faculty member as the course head, but delegate teaching responsibilities to non-ladder appointments.
And large courses often rely on an army of non-ladder faculty or graduate students to teach most of the course material. The introductory course Economics 10, led by economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, has 31 section leaders who teach the majority of classes.
Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell said non-ladder faculty offer a pragmatic solution to dealing with the reality of limited resources, in terms of finances and qualified manpower.
“FAS will always want the core of the teaching done by ladder faculty, but it makes sense to have some flexibility around the edges to augment that teaching,” Campbell said.
Harvard also has a financial incentive to rely on non-ladder faculty, whose salaries are significantly less than those of ladder faculty. According to Alison D. Jones, lecturer on sociology, a non-ladder faculty member in the Sociology Department earns approximately three-quarters the salary of a junior faculty member.
A ZERO-SUM GAME
For all they contribute to undergraduate education, non-ladder faculty never earn the job security of the tenure track.
Until recently, lecturers and preceptors operated under annual contracts but with restrictions on their stay at Harvard: lecturers can stay for up to three years, preceptors can stay for up to five years, and Expos preceptors can teach for eight years.
FAS has since implemented some changes in response to recommendations in the report. The School now allows lecturers and preceptors to be hired on multi-year contracts “where there is a clear curricular need for doing so,” FAS Spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement.
But with tenure still off the table, departments must sometimes retain their prized non-ladder faculty members by offering them administrative duties. Non-ladder positions with administrative duties are significantly more stable but also more competitive. These instructors, including professors of the practice, senior lecturers, and senior preceptors, are appointed for five-year terms that are indefinitely renewable.
“Getting a position like this is almost as hard as getting tenure,” says Paul G. Bamberg ’63, a senior lecturer on mathematics.
With many of the most coveted non-ladder posts out of reach for the majority of the non-ladder faculty, some young teachers find themselves choosing between maintaining high teaching standards and conducting research in order to qualify for the tenure track.
According to Katarina A. Burin, a visiting lecturer in Visual and Environmental Studies, the requirements for tenure have created a zero-sum game between an instructor’s research and his or her teaching.
“Honestly,” says Jones, the lecturer in sociology, “I worry that the amount of time I put into my teaching is gradually diminishing my chance of getting a tenure track position, because I’m spending less time getting publications out.”
But Jones, who is in the midst of her second of three years as a lecturer, said she cannot see herself devoting any less time to her classes.
“It’s so hard for me, because I value teaching, and I think the classes I am teaching, which are more hands-on, are really better,” she said. “I’m trying to figure out all these things in my life, and determine, given the constraints of the system, what are my best options.”
Under the current system, the position of non-senior lecturer can act as a stepping stone to more permanent positions. Lecturers, especially in the social sciences, are often young post-docs who hold the position until they receive a tenure-track offer, from Harvard or another university.
“[People] explained politely that doing this sort of thing perpetually was not in keeping with the Harvard system,” Bamberg explains of his first position teaching physics as a lecturer.
And while Jones is content with the teaching responsibilities that her non-ladder position entails, ultimately she, like many of her non-ladder colleagues, is searching for a more stable job.
According to Jones, eliminating the stringent term limits for lecturers and extending annual contracts to two or three years would help to take some of the pressure off lecturers.
But the tenure system is not poised to change substantially.
WORLD CLASS STATUS
According to many professors, a research-based tenure system is the only possible way to maintain Harvard’s status as a world-class university.
“The heart of the University, the majority of courses, are going to be taught by regular faculty who are there for research, and nobody within the Harvard community wants to change that,” Campbell says.
Some say that professors engaging directly in cutting edge research are best positioned to teach future leaders in their fields.
“You need knowledge that’s not in the textbooks yet,” explains Gregory Tucci, senior lecturer in Chemistry and Chemical Biology and co-director of undergraduate studies in the Chemistry Department.
Katherine J. Hinde, who joined the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology this fall as an assistant professor on track for tenure, says she has referred to her own research while writing the syllabus for her spring course.
“I’m actually really excited about it because I am able to teach classes that are directly relevant to the kinds of questions I’m asking in my research,” she says.
Bamberg admits that his classes sometimes lack these connections even though he has spent many years conducting research in the past. He says it can now be difficult to supervise undergraduate theses, which have to connect to current mathematical research.
“It’s very important for fundamental research to be done and a lot of this is only going to be done at universities because the corporate pay off hasn’t turned up yet,” explains Bamberg.
THE COSTS OF TENURE FOR UNDERGRADUATES
Ladder faculty members may be teachers who are the most active in the development of and expansion of their respective fields of study, but they are often not the ones with the greatest impact on undergraduate academic experience.
“People going into non-ladder positions have more teaching experience, and sometimes that is by choice, which means that they are more committed to undergraduate teaching,” Jones says.
“We need to think about what it means to deliver the best education possible to our undergraduates,” says sociology professor Christopher Winship. “Depending on the course and its objectives, it is far from obvious that ladder faculty are always the best or the most appropriate teachers. Our students deserve the very best instructors, no matter what their status is as faculty.”
Non-ladder faculty on average receive higher Q scores—student-based feedback—than tenured faculty at Harvard. According to the 2009 report, non-ladder faculty received an average score of 4.40, comparable with other junior faculty, but substantially higher than the 4.09 average for full professors.
“Tenure is something that carries significant risks to the institution that grants it,” Campbell says. “Suppose you grant someone tenure and their teaching performance falls off. Then the University has no recourse—no ability to get better teaching.”
And for all the stability that tenure offers, some professors are nonetheless grateful for the opportunity to teach undergraduates free from the pressures of a tenure-track position.
“Not getting tenure at Harvard was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Bamberg says. He added that instead of conducting research, he spends his free time designing novel courses to enhance the undergraduate curriculum.
“I presumably free up other people to do world-class research,” he said.

Harvard China Care raised $25,000 on Friday to support the operation of a special care unit room in an orphanage in Beijing at an annual benefit dinner.
Harvard’s branch of China Care, which was founded eight years ago, runs a number of educational programs including play groups and mentoring for recently adopted children from China in the Boston area.
The club—which has hosted fundraisers for the last six years—was able to rake in an all-time high in donations this year.
“The number of donations was above what we had hoped for,” Harvard China Care’s President Maxwell L. Meyer ’12 said. “We’re so proud of the turnout that we had and the impact that this money will exert over the next year at our orphanage in China. This certainly means we will be able to provide the same level of support, or even a greater level of support than we have in the past.”
The special care unit which will receive the donations provides pre- and post-operational care to orphans, primarily those in need of cleft lip surgery. This past year, the unit aided around sixty children, according to Meyer.
The benefit included a silent auction, a fashion show featuring professional models and children from China Care’s programs, a performance by Harvard’s Asian American Dance Troupe, and two speakers.
“I thought that having [AADT] perform was really great because I don’t know if other people are that exposed to the culture. I don’t know what different types of people were there but I figured that was a nice way to bring in the cultural aspect of [the event],” Neda Shahriari ’12 said.
Items for the silent auction were donated by student groups and local businesses in Harvard Square and Boston. The clothing and professional models were provided by Freshob, a Boston-based clothing company.
“These donations were a huge help to us,” China Care’s vice-president, Nan R. Du ’12 said.
The event’s main sponsor was the Jenzabar Foundation, the philanthropic branch of a software company, which has donated over $100,000 to Harvard Child Care over several years.
“They’ve been one of our most constant and best supporters,” Du said. “They’ve really been a huge help to make sure that we honor our commitment to fundraising for the orphanages.”
About 90 people attended China Care’s benefit, which took place this year at the Sheraton Commander Hotel in Cambridge. It has been held in Boston in previous years.
Meyer said the hoped that the change in location would result in higher attendance.
“We brought it back to campus because we wanted a greater level of student involvement and wanted a greater number of students to be familiar with the work that we do,“ Meyer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brightly-colored rugs, some with scenes of birds and trees, rolled over the usually stark concrete floors of Northwest Labs this past weekend. A live family band played Ecuadorian music on mandolins and hand flutes, which echoed through the ordinarily quiet basement space.
Little kids ran through the packed crowds of people, and artisans from around the world showcased their work.
It was part of the 29th annual Cultural Survival Bazaar at Harvard—a series of markets that unites vendors and artisans of indigenous work from countries in Africa, South and North America, and Asia.
One of the artisans was Algonquin Abenaki tribesman, Lenny J. Novak, whose tribal name is Lone Wolf.
“[It] feels like walking through a museum when everyone’s artwork is out,” he said.
Novak was selling his novel dream catchers—dark brown, with thin threads made of imitation sinew woven thickly together.
“It was a mistake,” Novak said on his design. “I tried it doing my own way and came up with something new.”
This weekend’s bazaar at Northwest Labs is just one of a series, hosted by Cultural Survival.
The organization, which promotes the rights and artwork of indigenous cultures, was founded by the late Anthropology Professor David Maybury-Lewis after he worked in the field with the Xavante tribe in Brazil.
According to Cultural Survival Program Manager David M. Favreau, this experience informed him on challenges facing indigenous tribes.
“[Maybury-Lewis] realized the challenges the Xavante faced were the same challenges facing indigenous cultures all over our planet,” Favreau said.
Favreau said these challenges spanned a host of problems, from loss of land, decline of culture, and degeneration of language. The Bazaar supports the members of the tribes and often presents modernized iterations of traditional art.
“An artisan might take something from their tradition, but they make something more contemporary,” said Favreau, who described the bazaars as “a chance to give gifts that give twice.”
“They’re not just giving a one-of-a-kind, handmade item to family or friends: they’re also supporting artisans and projects in [the indigenous] communities,” he said.
One such project is Project Have Hope, which seeks to empower women and their children in the Acholi Quarter of Uganda, and is supported by the sale of papier-mâché bead necklaces at the Bazaar.
“The money spent at the Bazaars goes a long way towards contributing to improving programs and the livelihood of artisans who are preserving their cultures by making traditional art that has been passed down for thousands of years, in many cases,” Favreu said.
In addition to offering a platform for the artwork, the Bazaar also features programming that teaches about indigenous cultures, such as Native American storytelling and craft-making.
“It’s a great chance for people and their families to come and enjoy a festive atmosphere and a worldly marketplace,” Favreau said. “They don’t have to buy anything, and they can still have a good time.”
The Bazaars continue throughout December in locations in Cambridge and Boston. The markets will move to CGIS next weekend, and to the Prudential Center the weekend of Dec. 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University vice president Edward C. Forst ’82 will retire from his position as co-head of investment management at Goldman Sachs, according to internal memos obtained by news organizations last week.
According to the New York Times, insiders speculate that Forst’s departure was a culmination of building tension within the investment management division, including Forst’s alleged failure to attend an important meeting with a client.
During Forst’s one-year stint at Harvard, he worked with University departments and the Harvard Management Company to manage budgets and investments during the worst of the 2008 financial crisis.
Forst became the University’s first executive vice president, responsible for streamlining the management of administration, human resources, and finance.
He helped to restructure Harvard’s investments to reduce risk in the endowment, and sought to scale back expenditures across the University.
“Ed has made important contributions to Harvard’s work, from stem cell research to university finances to financial aid. I have benefitted from his counsel both at Harvard and as an engaged alumnus,” University president Drew G. Faust wrote in an email.
Three weeks after Forst arrived at Harvard, then Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson asked him to help craft the $700 billion dollar bailout for struggling financial institutions. Forst agreed to advise Paulson while continuing to serve as vice president at Harvard.
But in 2009, Forst left the University to become global co-head of Goldman Sach’s investment management division.
Forst has not publicly discussed future job plans. He did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
According to memos signed by Goldman CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75, Eric S. Lane—an internal hire—will replace Forst, who plans to retire at the end of the year.
Even after leaving the University, Forst maintained a presence at Harvard, participating in both the Committee on Student Excellence and Opportunity, a body that seeks to improve financial aid, and the Committee on University Resources, a group of top-level donors.
Forst’s successor at Harvard, the current executive vice president, is Katherine N. Lapp.

Harvard Law School professors John G. Palfrey ’94 and Jonathan L. Zittrain ’95 challenged policy-makers last week to use more independently-collected data in formulating internet regulations and policy.
Palfrey and Zittrain published a paper in Science magazine titled “Better Data for a Better Internet,” which examines how internet policy can be better informed by improved data and research methods.
While huge quantities of data about personal internet usage has been collected by corporations, independently-collected information rarely makes it into the hands of policy-makers, according to Palfrey and Zittrain, who are faculty co-directors of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
“Policy-making is based, too often, on anecdotes collected at random (or worse, self-servingly) or on research produced or funded in ways that call into doubt its scholarly integrity,” they wrote in their paper.
According to Palfrey, he and Zittrain fear that the Internet is being increasingly regulated by both state and private actors.
In their paper, they cited President Hosni Mubarak’s decision to shut off internet and mobile phone service in Egypt following a series of uprisings as an example of how government regulation of the internet can have “profound societal impact.”
Palfrey said he believes that current internet policy is too often uninformed, while Zittrain said that people often look to simply confirm their ideological assumptions.
“There’s no getting ideology out of policy-making, but it would help to have a sense of what’s really going on out there—and what a proposed policy or action will likely do, both directly and in its side effects. Data helps,” Zittrain wrote in an email.
Palfrey said that he believes the public at large should be concerned with internet regulation.
“Nearly every aspect of life today in a wired society involves the Internet and digital media one way or another,” Palfrey wrote in an email. “The way in which the space is regulated matters to all of us.”
Thomas C. Rubin, chief counsel for Intellectual Property Strategy at Microsoft, agreed with Palfrey and Zittrain that it is in the broad interests of society to ensure that the most relevant data does not go unmined.
“The Internet is among the most significant and democratic innovations in all of history,” said Rubin. “As far as policymaking is concerned, data is an unalloyed good.”
Palfrey said that he and Zittrain would like to see a very different approach to data collection about online censorship, human behavior in digitally-mediated environments, and the network itself to better model how regulations will affect speed and price.
“With better data, we believe that we can have a better Internet,” Palfrey wrote. “We think the environment can be better for civic activism, for learning, and for innovation.”

Harvard has launched an investigation into an incident that occurred during the lab session  of an introductory science class on Tuesday, according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal. At least five students were sent to the hospital for treatment of eye injuries.
“Harvard closed the lab as soon as the incident was reported,” Neal wrote in an email to The Crimson, adding that the review has been “designed to determine what occurred and to prevent any recurrence.”
As of Sunday night, the teaching staff of Life and Physical Sciences A who were repeatedly emailed for comment remained mum on the incident.
Course head Gregory Tucci, Head Teaching Fellow Joshua I. Rosenbloom, and University Spokesperson Nanci Martin declined to provide information about the incident, instead deferring to Neal.
On Tuesday afternoon, about 60 LPSA students headed to Science Center 117 to complete the last lab of the semester, which involved observing DNA samples placed on a transilluminator that emitted ultraviolet light.
Although a protective shield is supposed to cover the device whenever students make observations, some students did not use the shield correctly while viewing their samples. Some were also not wearing safety goggles, resulting in temporary injury to their eyes that caused irritation and blurry vision a number of hours later, according to students in the course.
Printed instructions for the lab made no mention of the need to use safety goggles or to view the gel through a clear protective screen.
It is unclear whether verbal instructions regarding safety procedures were issued to the students.
According to Neal, “the exposure caused some superficial dermal and ocular irritation and/or inflammation in some students. Some students also experienced discomfort from mild corneal abrasions.” He added that students are expected to suffer no permanent damage.
Just days after the incident, course staff in at least one life sciences class may be striving to institute stricter laboratory safety policies.
On Wednesday, Ahmet S. Vakkasoglu, who is a teaching fellow in Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology,” sent an email to the students in his section, who would be using transilluminators similar to those used in LPSA in their own lab on Thursday.
“Very recent events in other classes regarding the misuse [of] UV [boxes] made us to be more cautious in the lab,” Vakkasoglu wrote.
He added that “no students will be allowed to place the gels onto (or work with) the UV lightboxes—only TFs can do so” and that “any students who do not wear proper lab attire and safety goggles will not be allowed in the labs.”
Alexander G. J. Bonorris ’15, who was one of the students in the 12 p.m. LPSA lab on Tuesday, trekked to UHS by himself with only limited vision in his left eye at 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning.
Bonorris was quickly put in a taxi after an initial check-up and sent to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, where several students had already been sent earlier that night.
Bonorris was met there by Oak Yard Resident Dean of Freshmen Jonas V. Clark.
Neal said that the University has reached out to all students affected by the ultraviolet light exposure. Tucci, the course head, also sent all LPSA students an email on Wednesday afternoon encouraging them to report any eye irritation or pain to UHS.
Bonorris said he does not hold his teaching fellow or Tucci responsible for his injury.
“I consider it my fault,” he said. “I should have had my goggles on.”
But Bonorris’ mother, Judith Rabinowitz, said she remains concerned.
When Bonorris called her several days after the incident to briefly tell her what had happened, Rabinowitz said her initial reaction was “shock and concern and lack of understanding.”
“I had very partial information from him about what had happened,” she said.
On Sunday, Rabinowitz said she called her son and asked why “nobody from Harvard call[ed] the parents about a potentially dangerous injury.”
“I think we were in the dark basically about what happened,” she said.
Rabinowitz, who works for the U.S. Department of Justice in the Bay Area, said she has not considered taking legal action against the University.
“I don’t have enough information about the incident or the consequences to my son’s health to even know how to think about it,” she said.

Vice President for Policy A. Clayton Spencer has been selected as Bates College’s eighth president, Bates announced Sunday. Spencer, who served under four Harvard presidents, has been an influential advisor to University President Drew G. Faust and has played a role in shaping some the most significant Harvard initiatives of the past decade.
“Bates has made a brilliant choice,” said University President Drew G. Faust in an email to Harvard faculty and senior administrators. “Clayton ... has been an astute and always forthright advisor to Harvard’s presidents, deans, and governing boards for the last fifteen years.”
Spencer’s policy contributions include helping to shepherd the Harvard-Radcliffe merger, spearheading the creation of a summer program for local high school students, and contributing to the broad expansion of need-based tuition support under the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, according to Faust.
“I have been blessed to work closely with her on every aspect of admission and financial aid during her time at Harvard,” said Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 in a statement. “Her contributions have transformed Harvard in countless ways and future generations of Harvard students will benefit from her tenure.”
Spencer’s work with educational policy issues extends back to her time as a staffer for Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. During her tenure with Kennedy, she worked as chief education counsel for the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
Spencer—whose father served as president of Mary Baldwin and Davidson Colleges—attended Phillips Exeter Academy before matriculating at Williams College. She sits on the Board of Trustees at both of her alma maters.
Asked how her departure would affect the administration at Harvard, Spencer said that her departure “coincides with a moment in Drew’s presidency when she has assembled a marvelous team.”
“My leaving will free up opportunities for lots of senior people in the ranks,” she said. “You can be irreplaceable without being indispensable.”
Spencer will assume the presidency at Bates on July 1, 2012. Her unanimous election by the Board of Trustees at Bates comes after an international presidential search.
“She is a true national leader in higher education, and she understands Bates in a very personal way, endorsing its innovative approach to the academic curriculum and its unpretentious ambition for excellence in all aspects of the liberal arts experience in the 21st century,” said Michael W. Bonney, chair of the board of trustees at Bates, in a statement.
Asked about her experience working at Harvard under four University presidents, Spencer replied concisely.
“I loved every minute of it,” she said.

Harvard Business School leaders held a breaking-ground ceremony on Friday to honor Indian tycoon Ratan N. Tata and officially begin the construction of Tata Hall, a new building that will house classrooms and living accommodations for students in the executive education program.
The building will be funded, in part, by a $50 million gift from philanthropic subsidiaries of the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, and the Tata Education and Development Trust.
“A moment like this is very special for Harvard Business School,” HBS Dean Nitin Nohria said. “The experience that students have living here is as vital a part of their HBS education as their experience in the classroom.”
According to Nohria, more than one half of the program’s students hail from across the world. The program strives to teach current executives management skills to improve their leadership.
“The executive education program represents a special opportunity for us to welcome remarkable leaders to the school,” Nohria added.
Tata is head of one of India’s largest conglomerate companies—which counts Tetley Tea and Jaguar in its portfolio—and is himself a graduate of HBS’s executive education program.
“I am so proud to give back to an institute that has done so much for me and so many other people,” Tata said.
Former HBS Dean Jay O. Light highlighted that Tata’s experience as a graduate of the executive education allowed him a closer perspective of the program.
“Mr. Tata is someone who really understood what the residential experience is all about,” said Light, under whose administration the project was initiated.
In recognizing other attributes of Tata’s that were integral in the school’s decision to work with him on the project, Light cited Tata’s position on the Dean’s Board of Advisors and the leadership that he has displayed as chairman of the Tata Group.
“Mr. Tata is an amazing leader with vision and focus, and through his generosity Tata Hall will make an incredible contribution to the Business School,” Light said.
The new space will consist of seven floors, two of which will have walls made of glass to provide views of the Charles River. The building will also include two executive education classrooms and enough beds for an additional 179 students.
Tata Hall is scheduled to open in late 2013 and is expected to cost $100 million to construct.

Late in the fourth quarter, Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 found Stevie Johnson twice—once in the middle of the field for a gain of 22, and a second time on a quick in route in the end zone—to bring Buffalo within six.
But that’s as close as the Bills would get. After orchestrating the touchdown drive on the penultimate possession, Fitzpatrick was unable to bring the Bills all the way back. The 23-17 home loss at the hands of the Tennessee Titans Sunday afternoon extends the Bills’ current losing streak to five games.
Despite the defeat, Fitzpatrick completed 29 of 46 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown in the effort. He found 10 different receivers on the day.
The former Crimson gunslinger's touchdown completion moves him to 20 on the season, making him the first Bills’ quarterback to reach that mark in back-to-back seasons since Jim Kelly did so in 1994-95.
The Bills now move to 5-7 on the season, as the team’s rapid start has given way to a string of defeats. Buffalo will travel to San Diego next week to play against a reeling Chargers team, which has lost four in a row going into action on Monday night against Jacksonville.
Elsewhere, center Matt Birk ’98 and Co. propelled Ray Rice to over 200 rushing yards, as the Ravens rolled over Cleveland, 24-10, to improve to 9-3.
Montreal center Louis Leblanc was also in action this week, making his NHL debut on Nov. 30 against the Anaheim Ducks. The former Harvard hockey star—who left the Crimson after his freshman year—earned his first NHL point on Saturday with an assist in a 2-1 victory against the Los Angeles Kings. Leblanc has played 47 shifts on Montreal’s current road trip and boasts a plus-minus of +1.
The Canadiens will come home Tuesday to face the Columbus Blue Jackets.

Playing 27 matches in one day seems like a pretty tall order.
But that’s exactly what the players of the Harvard women’s squash team (7-0, 1-0 Ivy) did this past Saturday, as they swept the Amherst (1-1, 1-0 NESCAC), Wellesley (4-6), and Boston College (1-3) squads.
“It was a really good weekend,” sophomore Natasha Anzik said. “Everyone came together and had great matches.”
No. 1 HARVARD 9, No. 31 BOSTON COLLEGE 0
Claiming victory in a 9-0 sweep, the Crimson ended its Saturday play at MIT’s Zesiger Center with apparent ease. Despite the change in Harvard’s lineup, which included rookies Haley Mendez and Julianne Chu in the top two slots, the Eagles failed to find success on the courts—the Crimson captured each match in straight sets in its first-ever matchup against Boston College.
New faces appeared further down the ladder as well, with freshmen Megan Murray and Yuleissy Ramirez playing in the No. 4 and No. 7 spots.
“They’re a talented group,” said sophomore Georgie Brinkley of the team’s newest players. “Squash is an individual sport, so I think it was a new experience for the freshmen to play in college and compete as part of a team. … We’re all excited to see them show their skill in the rest of the season.”
Brinkley herself also displayed her skills this past weekend. At No. 6, the Locust Valley, N.Y. native played her second match of the season in the top nine; her first occurred only hours earlier against the Blue’s Jennifer Hsu at No. 8.
HARVARD 9, No. 28 WELLESLEY 0
In its middle match of the day, Harvard felled Wellesley in dominant fashion despite a gap of 29 years since its last match against the Blue.
Further changes in the order from top to bottom also did little to slow the Crimson’s momentum.
“The matches all went smoothly for everyone,” Chu said.
Chu herself played in the third slot against freshman Elizabeth Tyson. Winning 11-6, 11-8, 11-6, she continued to make the transition to college play look effortless despite her words to the contrary.
“It’s been a huge transition from junior squash to college squash for me,” she said. “Now we play as a team. [But] I love team-oriented sports, so it has been an especially great challenge.”
In the top spot versus sophomore Emma Haley, veteran and co-captain Nirasha Guruge also played to a 3-0 victory.
Excepting sophomore Julie Monrad’s match at No. 9, each of the other matches were won in straight frames. After losing her third game, Monrad came back and dominated the fourth, giving up only four points en route to defeating sophomore Stephanie Lee, 11-3, 11-5, 9-11, 11-4.
HARVARD 9, No. 15 AMHERST 0
Playing at home against its highest-ranked opponent of the day for the first time since 2003, Harvard did not drop a single game to the Lord Jeff crew. The Crimson is now 10-0 against Amherst.
“We got a lot of matches in against teams we don’t normally have the opportunity to play,” Brinkley said. “Overall, it was a great weekend for us.”
Junior Laura Gemmell made her only appearance of the weekend in the top spot versus rookie Arielle Lehman. The All-American easily dropped her opponent, notching a final score of 11-1, 11-4, 11-3.
But the most impressive performance of the day might just go to Murray. In her first career start, the Bronxville, N.Y. native took the first two frames, 11-1, 11-2, before blanking senior Lord Jeff Megan Clower 11-0 in the final frame.
“They’ve been doing such a good job,” said Anzik of Harvard’s rookies. “They’ve also been very supportive teammates, and it has been really obvious in the past couple of weeks. They’ve been very hardworking and they’ve been fitting in with the team well,” she added.
Anzik, too, did well on the weekend—against Amherst’s Rachel Lupien at No. 8, she won by an impressive margin, winning two of the three games with a score of 11-1.
At No. 3 and No. 4, juniors Natasha Kingshott and Sarah Mumanachit made quick work of their opponents, extending their undefeated seasons. Gemmell, Guruge, Mendez, Chu, and junior Eliza Calihan also have spotless records thus far.
The next challenge for the squad will be maintaining momentum and focus over the long winter break.
Following the New Year, the Crimson will face several top-10 teams, starting with No. 5 Penn.
But the team remains confident.
“You can see the intensity and focus increase in every player at practice as we get closer to the [tougher matches],” Brinkley said.

The Harvard men’s squash team (9-0, 1-0 Ivy) blew away the competition this weekend, defeating a slew of teams from the Northeast both at Barnaby Courts and away at MIT to preserve its undefeated record thus far.
The No. 5 Crimson began the weekend’s play on Friday, earning a 9-0 victory over New York University at Barnaby Courts.
The team then defeated Amherst (1-1), 9-0, Saturday morning before traveling to MIT and proceeding to defeat both MIT (3-5) and Boston College, 9-0, as well.
On Sunday, Harvard finished its successful weekend with two more 9-0 victories, beating Northeastern at MIT in the morning and then defeating Boston University back at home.
Although the Crimson did not play any high-ranked opponents, the squad got in a lot of court time in one weekend, allowing for many players throughout the roster to gain some experience.
“Last year, we didn’t play as many games,” sophomore Brandon McLaughlin said. “So, anytime we can get out on the court, it’s good to play.”
HARVARD 9, BU 0
In its last game of this long weekend of squash, Harvard breezed to a 9-0 win against the No. 48 Terriers.
This match marked the first time in program history the Crimson has faced off against BU and also the first time this season in the Terriers, a club team, have played a top-10 opponent.
HARVARD 9, NORTHEASTERN 0
On Sunday morning, Harvard finished its last game at MIT for the weekend with another 9-0 sweep in its first ever match against the No. 31 Huskies.
The Engineers provided the venue for various local teams, who haven’t really matched up in the past to play each other in a round-robin format.
“In the past ... we’ve had a pretty short season in terms of matches,” sophomore Thomas Mullaney said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t play these teams—they’re literally right in our own backyard. It’s a great way to get a few more matches in.”
HARVARD 9, BC 0
In the first ever matchup between the Crimson and the No. 36 Eagles, Harvard earned yet another 9-0 sweep at the neutral site.
The Crimson used some of its players outside the usual top nine to earn another lopsided victory against the BC club team.
“I think we had some pretty strong results over the weekend,” Mullaney said. “We had a couple of our JV guys step up and crunch out some huge wins.”
HARVARD 9, MIT 0
In the second game on Saturday, the Crimson defeated the No. 34 and host Engineers, 9-0, as well.
Harvard improved to 52-2 in the all-time series with this dominant performance. The team hasn’t lost to crosstown rival MIT since 1955.
HARVARD 9, AMHERST 0
In the first game of a triple-header on Saturday, the Crimson swept No. 21 Amherst at home, losing only one game all match and improving to 48-0 against the Lord Jeffs dating back to 1941.
The top-eight Harvard players won each match, 3-0, and each of the top-four players, led by McLaughlin at No. 1 spot, held his opponent to 10 points or less throughout each match.
At the No. 1 spot, junior Shaw McKean overcame a first-game loss and rebounded to win, 3-1, against Peter Mack of Amherst.
HARVARD 9, NYU 0
The Crimson used a mixed lineup of varsity and JV players in its opening match of the weekend against the Bobcats, an emerging club team according to the Collegiate Squash Association.
But Harvard still did not lose a single game. The No. 5 through No. 9 spots, each making his respective season debut, only gave up a combined 12 points throughout the match.
The top four of sophomore Nigel Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, junior Zeke Scherl, freshman Julian Kirby, and junior Alexander Ma also played well, each en route to his fourth win of the season.
This was only Harvard’s second time playing NYU and first outing against the Bobcats since defeating them, 4-1, in 1973.
The undefeated Crimson will be off until Jan. 14, but this weekend gave the Crimson valuable experience for future weekends like this.
“I think it was a good chance for us to get a good feel for what it’s going to be like come January when we have pretty rapid fire series of matches,” Mullaney said. “It’s a challenge trying to play so many matches in such a short time.”

The Harvard men’s hockey team rallied from a goal down on four separate occasions against the University of Massachusetts Amherst to escape with a 4-4 tie on Friday night.
After surrendering a goal just over a minute into the first period, the Crimson (3-3-3, 2-3-2 ECAC) battled from behind for most of the 60 minutes at the Mullens Center in Amherst, Mass. Harvard’s first three game-tying goals were each followed, within about a minute, by UMass Amherst (4-7-4, 2-6-3 Hockey East) scores to reclaim the lead.
Junior forward Marshall Everson had a career night for the Crimson, netting two goals to help keep Harvard on pace. Freshman defenseman Patrick McNally and senior defenseman Danny Biega tallied three and two assists, respectively.
Senior forward Alex Killorn added a goal of his own, and freshman forward Tommy O’Regan scored his second goal of the season to tie the game at four with eight minutes to play in regulation, pushing the game into extra time.
The Crimson failed to convert on an early power play in the overtime period, and the Minutemen defense held strong for the remainder despite a few scoring opportunities for Harvard.
The Crimson outshot its opponent, 44-35, on the night.
“There were a few things we would have liked to do better,” said sophomore defenseman Dan Ford, whose last-second shot in overtime sailed just over the frame of the net. “But overall, we were pretty happy with the effort.”
Like in many of its previous contests, the Crimson put itself in a hole early on. Just 90 seconds after the opening faceoff, Minutemen sophomore forward Conor Sheary put home a pass from teammate T. J. Snyer.
Harvard didn’t respond until the second period. Freshman forward Mike Seward drew a hooking penalty on UMass Amherst’s Patrick Kiley, and seconds later junior forward Alex Fallstrom drew a high sticking call on Joel Hanley to give the Crimson a five-on-three advantage.
The Minutemen killed the first penalty before Everson put in a rebound off of a Biega shot to even the score at one apiece 7:30 into the period.
But the tie proved fragile. Just over a minute later, Minutemen sophomore defenseman Colin Shea beat Harvard freshman goaltender Steve Michalek off of an assist from Kiley.
Five minutes after the score, the Minutemen earned their third penalty. Harvard cashed in on the man advantage, as Killorn fired a shot by goaltender Kevin Boyle, tallying his team-high sixth goal of the season.
This time the tie would last for only 30 seconds, as senior forward Danny Hobbs scored to put UMass ahead, 3-2, with five minutes left on the clock in the middle frame.
Kiley went to the penalty box for a second time four minutes into the third period, but the Crimson was unable to take advantage. Minutes later, after taking a pass from McNally, Fallstrom carried the puck deep into the UMass zone and fired a centering pass that was directed into the net by Everson.
But Harvard couldn’t hang on to the tie for long. Just a minute later, UMass’ Steven Guzzo forced the puck past Michalek after being rejected on his first two attempts to put the home team on top, 4-3.
The final equalizer came with eight minutes to play, as a shot from sophomore defenseman Danny Fick was deflected in by O’Regan.
For the first time, Harvard held its ground, not surrendering another score the rest of the way. UMass killed a power play resulting from a third Kiley penalty, and regulation ended with the score knotted at four.
Sheary crashed into Michalek early in the overtime period to give Harvard a five-on-four advantage, but the Crimson couldn’t capitalize. Everson was rejected at the right post by Boyle, denying his bid for a hat trick.
Fallstrom was later turned away on a wrap-around shot, and the Harvard odd-man rush in the waning seconds of the game came up empty as Ford’s shot went high. With either team unable to break the stalemate, the game ended in a deadlock.
The tie continues a pattern of comebacks for the Crimson. In its six wins and ties, Harvard has trailed five times, including in a 7-6 win over the University of New Hampshire in which they fell behind, 4-0, after the first period.
“I think it speaks to the team’s mental toughness,” Ford said. “When things haven’t gone right for us this year, we’ve consistently been able to get back to playing the way we want.”
Harvard was also adjusting to playing its first game of the year on Olympic-sized ice.
“That was a little different. It was a little bit of an adjustment in the first period,” Ford said. “But we settled down.”
McNally’s three assists were a career-high, giving the freshman seven on the year. That total is topped only by Biega, whose two assists give him 10 on the season, tied for fourth best in the ECAC.

After opening its season with a strong showing in the Garret Open hosted by Penn State in November, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams returned Saturday to State College, Pa., for the Penn State Invitational.
The Crimson turned an impressive performance against top-tier fencing programs Vassar, Penn State, UNC, NYU, Sacred Heart and Temple.
Three male fencers finished in the top 10 in their respective divisions in the Garret Open. This weekend, the men once again got off to a solid start.
In its opening match, the Crimson defeated Vassar by a convincing margin of 21-6. Harvard followed up its victory against the Owls with a 19-8 win over the Tar Heels, a 21-6 win over the Violets, and a 17-10 win over the Pioneers.
The epee squad on the men’s side played a crucial role in the matches against the Tar Heels and the Owls.
Leading the Crimson men were epee fencers sophomore Mike Raynis, who went 11-1 for the day and senior James Hawrot, who posted a 12-3.
In the saber, freshman Alexander Ryjik dominated the field with a 13-2 record, including a win over former NCAA champion Olec Ochocki of Penn State.
In the foil, walk-on junior Thomas Snell captured a pair of wins against a strong Nittany Lions squad.
But in spite of the dominant victories in the tournament, the Harvard men were unable to run the table, as the Crimson dropped its match against hosts Penn State, 15-12, to finish the tournament with a 5-1 record.
“We all did fairly well in this tournament,” freshman epee fencer Peregrine Badger said. “In the match against Penn State, there were a few calls that could have gone either way, so the score could have easily been 14-13 or 15-12 in our favor. So I don’t think that the actual results against Penn State is indicative of our performance in this tournament, with respect to PSU. In the end we beat all the other schools that we faced, which is always good.”
“Overall it was a very good performance for us,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “Though both sides lost to Penn State, it was a close match on both sides. Penn State is a perennial powerhouse—they were second at the NCAAs last year—and I think we would have done better against Penn State this time, except for the fact that our freshman fencer on the men’s side Brian Kaneshige—a high performer for the team—was away at tryouts to make the national team. Even then, I think we had a great outing against Penn State and the rest of the field on both the men’s and women’s sides.”
The women also had a productive outing. After capturing gold medals at last month’s Garret Open, defending national champion sophomore foil fencer Alexandra Kiefer and senior saber fencer Caroline Vloka returned to the mat hoping that some of that momentum would carry over to the Penn State Invitational.
Kiefer and Vloka did not disappoint, as they posted individual records of 15-1 and 16-0, respectively, to lead the women’s side to a overall team record of 5-1 for the day.
Though the women dropped their opening match against host Penn State, 16-11, they reversed the score next against Temple to win, 16-11.
The Harvard women closed out the tournament in commanding style with four straight victories, topping UNC, 19-8, NYU, 21-6, Sacred Heart, 22-5, and Vassar, 25-2.
With both the men’s and women’s teams posting strong performances, the day’s outcome proved quite promising for the Crimson as it sets its sights on Ivy League play after winter break.
For Brand, the holiday could not come at a better time for the team.
“In general, we have been dealing with quite a few injuries this year, so the break is coming for us just as the right time. We need our guys to heal and recover in time for the upcoming Ivy season.”

Taking on some of the best talent in the nation, two Harvard wrestlers earned their spots in the top eight of their respective weight classes this weekend at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational. With action wrapping up on Saturday, junior and No. 18 Steven Keith secured the Crimson’s highest finish of third place at 133 pounds, and freshman James Fox picked up seventh place at 197 lbs. Harvard finished the event 15th overall out of 34 teams.
After coming off two successful weekends with a second-place finish at the Keystone Classic and a third-place finish at the Binghamton Open, Keith once again proved to be at the top of the pack with a victory in the third-place matchup over No. 11 Zac Stevens of Michigan.
Keith, the No. 8 seed in the tournament, fought his way through the wrestlebacks to earn third place, marking the first time that Keith gained a spot on the podium at the event.
In his opening two bouts, Keith edged out a victory over Hoftsra’s Jamie Franco before dominating No. 9 Jordan Thome of Army, 9-0. Keith lost in the quarterfinals to No. 1 Logan Steiber of Ohio State, who earned a fall at 4:40 to move onto the semifinals.
Despite the setback, Keith rebounded to win three more matches for a spot in the third-place contest.
Even though he had a lower seed than opponent No. 5 Zac Stevens, Keith took control of the match, taking down Stevens, 6-0.
“My strategy was just to wrestle my match,” Keith said. “I had wrestled well up to that point, and I knew that I was feeling good and moving really well, so I was just going to keep wrestling the way I was.”
Fox, unseeded in the tournament, was the Crimson’s only other top-eight finisher, picking up seventh place after a medical default from Michigan’s Max Huntley. In his opening round, Fox defeated Paul Rands from Navy, 7-1, but then fell to the No. 2 seed, Matt Powless from Indiana, 13-4.
In the wrestlebacks, Fox opened his quest for a chance on the podium by narrowly defeating Ohio State’s Andrew Campolattano, 9-8, but then lost to No. 8 Brandon Palik from Drexel, 7-4. The default from Huntley gave Fox a seventh-place finish for his first time competing at the event.
“He’s really been getting better every time he goes out there,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “This weekend was great. He wrestled so well … He’s starting to believe—I can see it in how he’s wrestling.”
No. 2 Peppelman was a favorite to go far in the tournament, but his run was stopped in the quarterfinals by No. 7 seed T.J. Hepburn from Nebraska-Kearney, an eventual finalist. Peppelman started out strong with a bye and two easy wins over his opponents, but was forced to forfeit in the quarterfinals due to medical reasons.
With a chance to wrestle for a spot in the top eight, Peppelman was again forced to forfeit his match against Josh Demas, the eventual sixth-place finisher at 157 lbs, due to injury.
Two other Crimson wrestlers who came away from the event with wins were junior Paul Liguori and sophomore Cameron Croy.
Despite his surprise second-place finish at the Binghamton Open, Liguori lost in the first round of the Las Vegas event to No. 6 seed Craig Eifert in the 149-pound division.
Despite the setback, Liguori picked up two more victories over Stanford’s Timmy Boone and California Baptist’s Dylan Catalline, before eventually losing to University of Nebraska’s Brandon Wilbourn, 5-3.
Croy had a similar result at 184 lbs., dropping his first bout to North Carolina’s Thomas Ferguson, 10-2. Croy picked up two more victories in the wrestlebacks but eventually fell to Brown’s Ophir Bernstein, 10-9.
Senior Bryan Panzano and freshman Joe Barbato also competed in the event at 174 lbs. and 125 lbs., respectively, but both went 0-2.
Panzano was pinned by No. 4 seed Justin Zeerip of Michigan 23 seconds into the match and then lost 16-0 to Air Force’s Clayton Gable. Barbato lost to Arizona State’s David Prado in the first round, 6-2, and then lost to Utah Valley University’s Colby Christensen, 7-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team sought to divide and conquer this weekend. The squad split up to compete in three invitationals: the Georgia Invitational, the MIT Winter Invitational, and the Texas Invitational, hosted by the University of Texas at Austin. Propelled by several of its youngest members, the Crimson emerged from the trio of meets fairly satisfied.
“[This weekend], we set some team records and had some very strong relays,” co-captain Kristi Korsberg said. “I’m really excited about it.”
GEORGIA INVITATIONAL
Up against three of the top five ranked teams in the nation, Harvard took to the water in Gabrielsen Natatorium at the University of Georgia. Though it was the No. 1 Bulldogs and No. 2 University of California, Berkeley who battled for the invitational’s team trophy, a number of Crimson swimmers turned in solid showings.
“We come [to the Georgia Invitational] every year,” Korsberg said. “We always have very high expectations. This year, I feel like we outdid even our highest expectations.”
Freshman Stephanie Ferrell surely exceeded expectations at the Georgia Invite. The Verona, N.J., native broke the team record in the 100-meter breaststroke with a blistering time of 1:02.64.
“Our freshmen have been strong from day one.” Korsberg said. “They’ve really filled in a lot of gaps from the girls who graduated last year. In a lot of ways, we’re following their lead ... riding the wave of their energy and enthusiasm.”
Another first-year, Courtney Otto, reached the finals of the 400-yard individual medley for Harvard. In a heat containing four Georgia swimmers and two from Berkeley, Otto finished in eighth place, with a time of 4:15.14.
Freshman Faith Martin also competed in the 400-yard individual medley. The rookie raced to a time of 4:20.02, which was good for 15th place. Senior Hilary Roberts and junior Laura Evans rounded out the event for the Crimson, finishing in 19th and 20th place, respectively.
In the 200-yard medley relay, two of Harvard’s teams turned in one of the weekend’s closest finishes. The “B” team of Ferrell, junior Caroline Weaver, sophomore Danielle Schulkin, and freshman Sarah Sumner edged out the Crimson’s “A” team by a margin of 0.01 seconds. Harvard’s photo-finishing squads earned 13th and 14th place.
The Crimson also proved its mettle in the 800-yard freestyle relay. The team of Martin, Sumner, freshman Kelsey Hojan-Clark, and senior Catherine Zagroba cracked the top 10 with a finishing time of 7:20.07.
TEXAS INVITATIONAL
A group of five Harvard divers made the trip to Austin, Texas, this weekend to compete at the Texas Invitational. Though this group avoided the likes of Georgia and UC Berkeley, facing No. 3 Texas was little consolation. The Crimson’s more experienced competitors were still able to make a splash in the Lone Star State and walk away with some top-10 finishes.
In the women’s one-meter dive, junior Brittany Powell turned in a ninth-place finish, with a score of 229.65. Senior Leslie Rea was just behind Powell, scoring 229.45, which earned her 10th place.
The duo was joined by freshman Cassandra Corneau, whose trip to Austin was her first time traveling with her new teammates.
“I loved it,” Corneau said. “It was great to be out there with most of the members of the team. We spent a lot of time together and definitely got closer.”
Competing against some of the best divers in the country, the rookie turned in respectable performances over the weekend. Corneau finished in 17th place in both the one-meter and three-meter dive events.
“Seeing how good [the Texas divers were] was a little intimidating,” Corneau said. “But I just had to keep calm and try not to get psyched out.”
MIT WINTER INVITATIONAL
While their teammates were competing down South, some members of the Harvard squad held down the fort in Cambridge, competing in the MIT Winter Invitational.
A pair of Crimson divers made a statement at MIT’s Zesiger Center. Sophomore Alex Stanton and senior Jessica Stanchfield took first and third places, respectively, in the women’s one-meter and three-meter dives.
In both events, NYU’s Kelly Dietz thwarted Harvard’s chance of a one-two finish. MIT came away with the team title at its home invitational behind strong relay performances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many students celebrated or bemoaned the beginning of reading period this weekend, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) was on the road taking on unfamiliar foes.
The Crimson took nine swimmers to the AT&T Winter National Championships in Atlanta, Ga., where the squad faced tough competition from the nation’s elite club swimmers. Harvard turned in some inspired individual performances on the big stage, marking an impressive weekend.
Meanwhile, the divers headed to Austin for the Texas Invitational, eventually putting three divers in the one-meter finals and two in the three-meter finals.
AT&T WINTER NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
With Olympians competing in the events, the Crimson knew it was in for a challenge when it traveled to Georgia for the AT&T Winter National Championships.
The Harvard swimmers were racing unattached to a college or club this weekend, which allowed them to race against world-record holders and Olympians and gain valuable experience in long-course meets, according to sophomore Spenser Goodman.
“We came in there in a different point of our season than a lot of other teams there, and we got a lot of incredible swims from our guys,” freshman Michael Gaudiani said.
And after achieving early Ivy success with wins against Dartmouth and Cornell, the Crimson was looking at the weekend as a chance to gauge its training to date.
“It’s great for our team to see some competition outside the Ivy League, with bigger teams and programs, and see how we stack up against them,” Gaudiani said.
Despite the tougher competition, many Harvard swimmers managed to make a splash, as a handful of underclassmen displayed their talent.
Freshman Chuck Katis placed 50th overall with his performance in the 200-meter individual medley.  Despite racing slower than his previous time at the UNC Invite, the Falls Church, Va. native outraced the rest of his teammates. The rookie also led the way for his teammates in the 200-meter breaststroke, capping off an impressive weekend.
Freshman Kyle McIntee posted a time of 4:01.36 in the preliminaries of the 400-meter freestyle to enter the C finals, where he placed 10th.  His time was just above that of Goodman, who placed 42nd overall.
Junior Greg Roop set the tempo for the Crimson in the 1,500-meter freestyle, where he notched a time of 16:20.40. Following just behind him were freshmen Reed Snyder and Gaudiani, with times of 16:28.23 and 16:47.79, respectively.
And despite the added stress that looming finals bring, Gaudiani believes his team reaped the benefits of cross-country travel this weekend.
“We were swimming against the top-10 teams in the countries … and just being at the national level and seeing all the Olympians is a really great motivator,” he said.
TEXAS INVITATIONAL
With teams from all over the country competing, including No. 2 Texas, the Harvard divers battled to put three competitors in the one-meter finals and two divers in the three-meter finals.
“It was definitely a good experience getting outside the Ivy League,” junior Michael Stanton said. “The caliber of diving out there was very high, and it was a competitive atmosphere.”
Stanton took fourth in the prelinaries of the one-meter dive with a score of 298.20.  Sophomore Joe Zarrella and freshman George Doran followed him, placing seventh and eighth, respectively.
But in the finals, Doran overtook his two teammates, putting up a score of 290.35 to place fifth overall.  Zarrella and Stanton tied for seventh with 273.65.
In the three-meter preliminaries, Zarrella, who reached the finals with Stanton, led the Crimson with a score of 313.50. In the finals, Zarrella improved on his preliminary score, notching a 330.40, good for fifth place.
Now halfway through its competitive season, Harvard is hoping to continue posting strong performances as it heads into winter training in January.
“Right now we are just trying to stay consistent and continue training … and make sure we are on top of our game in the pool,” Stanton said.
In addition to acknowledging the strength of the diving team this season, Stanton also pointed out the rookies’ impact on the swimming side.
“Our freshman class has been killing it,” Stanton said. “With this class, we are all pretty confident we are going to have a good season.”

The good news just keeps on coming for Harvard senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz.
In a ceremony held Monday at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, Ortiz and Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews earned the Asa S. Bushnell Cup, the equivalent of the Most Valuable Player award in the Ivy League.
This year marks the first time that the Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year shared the award.
The Ivy League named four finalists—two from both the offensive and defensive sides—for the cup. Ortiz beat out Penn senior linebacker Erik Rask, while Mathews topped Dartmouth senior tailback Nick Schwieger.
For Ortiz, the accolade marks the end of a remarkable multi-year transformation. Once seen as an underachieving player, Ortiz grew to become the most dominant defensive player in the Ancient Eight.  Considered perhaps the strongest man in Ivy League football, the Avon Park, Fla. native drew double teams on nearly every snap. Yet, he managed to lead the league with 10 sacks.
He also earned a reputation for stepping up on the biggest of stages. Against Penn, with an outright Ivy title on the line, Ortiz had his most impressive game of 2011, forcing and recovering a fumble while tallying two sacks and 10 tackles.
In the coming months, Ortiz is expected to receive NFL attention.
On the offensive side, in a season The New York Times preemptively dubbed the “Year of the Quarterback in the Ivy League,” Mathews emerged as the best of them all, leading all Ivy passers with 3412 passing yards (Yale’s Patrick Witt was second with 2368) and 25 touchdowns through the air. His 67.9 percent completion percentage paced the conference as well.
The sophomore took his play to a whole new level in the season’s final two games. Against Columbia, Mathews’ 521 passing yards set a school record, as the sophomore led the Big Red to a 62-41 victory. The following week, against a favored Penn team, Mathews broke his own record, throwing for 548 yards en route to a 48-38 win.

The Harvard men's basketball team continues to make history.
In Monday's ESPN/USA Today coaches poll, the Crimson was ranked No. 24—the first ranking in a major poll in program history. Harvard amassed 95 points, one shy of a three-way tie with Illinois and Gonzaga for 22nd place. The Crimson is one of five schools on the list with an unblemished 8-0 record and one of 11 teams still undefeated.
The Associated Press' Top 25 also ranked Harvard in the top 25, placing it at the bottom of the list with 191 points, two points off No. 24 Illinois.
One week ago, the Crimson landed in what was essentially the No. 27 position, 17 points shy of No. 25. But wins this week against Vermont and Seattle—coupled with losses by California, St. Louis, Vanderbilt, and UNLV—propelled undefeated Harvard into the top 25.
This is the first time an Ivy League school is featured on a major poll since Cornell placed 22nd on the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll in 2010. The last Ancient Eight team to be ranked in the AP poll was the 1997-1998 No. 8 Princeton Tigers squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number 24 holds a very special place in basketball lore.
It’s the number worn by Kobe Bryant and Moses Malone, the number of seconds on an NBA shot clock, the date in November 1960 in which Walt Chamberlain recorded 55 rebounds, and the number of points Michigan State’s Magic Johnson scored in the classic 1979 NCAA championship game against Larry Bird’s Indiana State.
For the Harvard men’s basketball team, the number now has a new historic meaning.
It’s now the Crimson’s national ranking in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll.
For the first time in the program’s 101-year history, Harvard (8-0) was ranked in a national poll on Monday, earning the distinction after just missing out a week ago.  The Crimson was also ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll.
“This is a significant achievement,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m proud of the hard work [the team] put in, and I’m very pleased and flattered that we’ve been thought of in that capacity at this point of the season.”
The distinction marks another in a long line of firsts that the squad has achieved under Amaker. Last year, the Crimson won a share of its first Ivy League title, and this season played in its first regular season tournament, the Battle 4 Atlantis, which it won over Thanksgiving break.
The Crimson’s championship in the Bahamas—which included wins over Utah, then-No. 20/22 Florida State, and Central Florida—garnered the squad a wave of media attention that nearly pushed it into the national rankings a week ago.
Harvard ended up just barely missing out on the Top 25, finishing essentially 27th in both polls—14 points behind then-No. 25 Texas A&M in the AP poll and 17 points behind then-No. 25 St. Louis in the coaches poll.
But losses this week by AP No. 18 UNLV, No. 19 Gonzaga, No. 20 Vanderbilt, No. 23 St. Louis, and No. 24 California opened a door for the Crimson to break into the rankings, and Harvard took care of business by defeating Vermont on the road Thursday and Seattle at home yesterday to stay undefeated.
“There’s been a lot of good basketball played around the country,”  Amaker said. “It’s neat to be thought of as one of those teams. … But  it’s early. There’s a long way to go.”
Harvard just missed out on being ranked 22nd in the coaches poll, finishing a single point—equivalent to one more ballot listing the Crimson as No. 25—behind the Bulldogs and the Fighting Illini. But with 95 points, Harvard is 16 ahead of the No. 25 Aggies.
The Crimson received 191 points in the AP poll, two behind No. 24 Illinois and three ahead of the next closest team, the Rebels.
Harvard is the first Ivy League squad to be ranked since the 2010 postseason, when Cornell’s Sweet 16 team finished No. 17 in the coaches poll. The last Ancient Eight team to be ranked in the AP poll was No. 8 Princeton in 1998.
With the distinction, the Crimson left just seven other Division I teams—Brown, Citadel, Colgate, Furman, Lafayette, Lehigh, and William & Mary—as the only squads never ranked in the Top 25.
"The greatness on this campus is enormous," Amaker said. "We’re hopeful that maybe we can put a product out on the floor as a basketball program, on and off the court, that could be associated with some of the other great elements and entities on the campus. We just asked the question, 'Why not?'”
“It’s pretty exciting,” co-captain Oliver McNally added. “That’s really the whole thing—do something that’s never been done at Harvard before.”
But the Crimson’s time in the Top 25 could be brief. On Thursday night, Harvard faces its first test as a ranked team when it travels to Storrs, Conn., to face the defending national champion, No. 9 Connecticut.
The Huskies, led by sophomore guards Jeremy Lamb and Shabazz Napier, are the best team the Crimson will face during the regular season.
UConn blew the Crimson out, 81-52, last year, and another bad loss—or a defeat at BU Saturday—would likely knock Harvard out of the Top 25 as quickly as it got in.
“I was pleased to see our guys so happy to win a championship at the early part of the season, and now to have some of these other things occurring,” Amaker said. “Having said that, the grand prize is now we’ve got to go down and play at Storrs—so I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not.”

The atmosphere at the Harvard College Women's Center's "Teach me how to…" dance workshop was positively infectious as lively music, enthusiasm, and energy filled the Adams House dining hall on Wednesday night.
Each semester, the interns at the Harvard College Women's Center host one "just for fun" event, and the idea for this one came about from a desire to help students feel more comfortable on the dance floor and to be part of the on-going discussion about social space on campus.
"We thought it would be a really good space to address gender dynamics at parties while having fun," Bex Kwan '14 said.
The event included several workshops led by leaders affiliated with the Women"s Center and the Harvard Expressions Dance Modern Dance Companies.
Maya E. Rotmensch '14, a dancer in both dance companies, led one workshop entitled "Feet and Rhythm."
Rotmensch said that as a native of Israel, she wasn't sure how to dance at American parties and, as a result, wants to help others who might be experiencing similar anxiety on the dance floor.
Another workshop provided advice on "partner dancing."
"If she turns away from you, that's usually a 'no' sign," one of the workshop leaders announced. "Grab a chair."
Although chairs may seem like awkward teaching tools, students didn't shy away from practicing their moves with their immobile partners.
Shakira played in the background as participants worked their hips and workshop leaders provided advice.
All in all, participants and leaders agreed that enthusiasm and energy ruled the night.
"I think everyone can dance, it's just about building the confidence to do it," Dike O. Nwokike '15 said afterwards.
The ultimate takeaway lesson?
Shakira was right; hips don't lie. You just need to have the confidence to shake them.
