With the release of his new single, “The Astronaut,” Jin becomes the second member of the K-pop super group BTS to officially promote as a solo artist. The track was co-written with Coldplay following their single “My Universe,” which brought the bands together for the first time last year. On “The Astronaut,” Jin borrows Coldplay’s idyllic and bittersweet signature soundscape to deliver a heartwarming love letter and temporary farewell to his fans around the world.
The release comes less than two weeks after the announcement that Jin, followed by the other members of BTS, will enlist in the South Korean Military to fulfill a mandatory service obligation. BTS had previously announced plans to enter “Chapter 2” of the band’s career, which will center solo promotions alongside continued group releases. “The Astronaut” continues this new era after J-Hope became the first member to promote solo with his July album “Jack in the Box.”
“The Astronaut” is, at its core, a message of love to Jin's fans. It is tinged with just enough nostalgia and melancholy to make it feel like a preliminary farewell ahead of the idol's upcoming enlistment. The song is forged out of Coldplay’s sound and in some ways feels like a Coldplay song in which Jin is stepping in as the band’s frontman. Luckily, Jin’s distinct vocals complement the band's sound well. The song slowly builds to a rousing final chorus as the singer belts, “When I'm with you/ There is no one else/ I get heaven to myself.” While not technically credited as a collaboration or feature, careful listeners will hear that Chris Martin provides backing vocals sprinkled throughout.
The song was first teased during BTS’s “Yet to Come in Busan” concert and was later revealed to have been written by Coldplay along with a special announcement that Jin would appear to perform the song live during Coldplay’s live streamed concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 29.
If the true friendship formed between Coldplay and the members of BTS wasn’t already clear, Martin’s heartwarming introduction of Jin before the performance showed the mutual love and respect between the bands.
“Two years ago, someone suggested to us that we should work with a Korean boy band. At first, I was full of judgment,” Martin said while introducing Jin. “It’s turned out to be one of the most fulfilling relationships that we have as a band and it’s taught us so much.”
Martin went on to reveal that it was Jin who had initially reached out asking for his help creating a song to say goodbye to his fans before enlisting. Martin responded with a version of “The Astronaut” which he “gifted” to the singer. The initial version was entirely in English, with Jin initially rewriting only the first verse in Korean. While talking with fans during a livestream, Jin later revealed that he had rewritten the second verse in Korean with Martin's encouragement the night before recording the track.
As the final instrumental fades out at the song's end, one can’t help but feel a lack of musical resolution. It’s as if Jin has purposely left listeners waiting for more — perhaps, as an unspoken promise to return with new music and performances for ARMYs in the future.

“Jin, jiyan, azadi!”
From a young age, Kurdish women like myself are introduced to this powerful phrase, which translates to “women, life, freedom.” Our families teach us that this phrase is an integral part of the liberation struggle against the powers that occupy us, coined by Kurdish resistance fighters of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. They teach us that we, too, are a part of the movement for our homeland; for women, life, and freedom.
In the past month, we’ve heard people repeat “zan, zendegi, azadi,” the Farsi translation of this phrase. I see people emphasizing solidarity with “Iranian women,” to fight for “freedom for Iran,” and to honor “Mahsa” Amini. While I will always join Iranians in standing against this regime, I can’t help but feel anger and resentment towards the erasure of Kurdish voices in this movement.
After the death of Jina Amini, I immediately thought of my own mother, who experienced the same injustices Kurdish women still face in Iran today. After surviving the 1988 Halabja massacre in the Iraqi state, she fled to Iran, where she lived for three years. Unlike Jina, however, she survived the oppression and violence that the Iranian regime inflicted, and continues to inflict, on Kurds.
Jina Amini, who was just 22 years old, was from the city of Saqqez in the Kurdistan province, the same city where the protests after her death first erupted. The city where Kurds continued to chant “women, life, freedom” as they have been for decades. Kurds have constantly echoed this phrase, but people finally joined us only after the Kurds of Saqqez screamed it in pain in the wake of Jina’s death.
To see this revolutionary phrase co-opted into Farsi without the acknowledgment of Jina’s Kurdish identity and its implications for her death is devastating. This phrase, the phrase I grew up with, the phrase that helped me reconnect with my Kurdish heritage, was taken away from me – from us. Many people had never heard of “women, life, freedom” until they saw it in Farsi, in headlines as part of the movement “for Iranian women.”
Under the Iranian regime, Kurdish names are banned. “Mahsa” was known to her family, friends, and community as Jina. Jina, the same name her mother repeated before her grave. Like many Kurdish women across our homelands, Jina often wore jili Kurdi (traditional Kurdish clothes). Like me, she heard Sorani Kurdish in her house. She, too, was familiar with the vibrant colors of the Kurdistan flag, a daughter of the sun.
Jina’s Kurdish identity was not irrelevant to her death. It is more than likely that the morality police knew that Jina was Kurdish when her brother allegedly pleaded with the police, telling them that they were not from Tehran, that they were just visitors. Iranian identification cards include postal codes, which indicate the province the detained person is from. Jina was from the Kurdistan Province of Iran.
Kurds make up only 10 percent of the Iranian population, yet in 2019 constituted nearly half of the political prisoner population in Iran. The Iranian regime has focused its attacks on predominantly Kurdish areas as well as other ethnic minority regions such as Balochistan. Iranian forces have gone so far as to attack military bases in the Kurdistan region of Northern Iraq for their uprisings against the Iranian regime. Yet, we only hear about the bravery and resilience of “Iranian” people.
Now, more than ever, is the time to stand in solidarity with Kurdish women fighting for independence not only in Iran, but all four occupied parts of Kurdistan. The people of Iran will never see a world free of this violent regime until the people of Kurdistan are able to freely walk our lands. This world would have allowed a young 22-year-old girl to walk the streets of her beloved Kurdistan while people greet her as Jina.
Our liberation is shared. Not only should we stand with Iranian protesters, but we should stand with Kurds, who are at the forefront of this movement. Jina Amini was a Kurdish woman; call her such. Call her by her real name, not the one imposed on her by the regime. Realize the history behind the phrase “women, life, freedom,” and start chanting it in the language of the women who coined it. The language that I grew up hearing in my house, just as Jina did in hers.
As a Kurdish woman on this campus, I have felt the erasure and exclusion of Kurdish voices from this movement, both intentional and unintentional. Likewise, I have seen the power of uplifting Kurdish voices, whether at the protest in front of Widener or the die-in at the John Harvard statue. However, there is so much work to be done: changing our rhetoric, asking President Bacow to express solidarity with both Iranian and Kurdish women, to chant “jin, jiyan, azadi,” and no longer using Jina Amini’s regime name in conversations and demonstrations on campus.
When you continue to march in the streets in solidarity with protesters in Kurdistan and Iran, when you post on social media, when you have conversations about what is happening, include the brave Kurds who made this movement possible. Include the women who continue to defend their homeland despite countless attempts at censorship and ethnic cleansing. Stand with Kurdish women.
One day, Kurds like Jina, in a safe and free Kurdistan, will continue to chant the phrase that we all should remember. Jin, jiyan, azadi.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Wellesley News Editorial Board declared their support for the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, Wellesley College President and Harvard alumna Paula A. Johnson ’80 rejected that editorial’s apparent support for the Mapping Project — a website that documents the locations of hundreds of Massachusetts organizations it wants to “dismantle” for allegedly supporting Israel. The incident triggered memories of when The Crimson Editorial Board’s prior decision to endorse the BDS movement sparked widespread outrage.
Six months later, reflecting on our own experience, this Board has come to the conclusion that President Johnson’s criticism of the Wellesley News’s BDS editorial fell short of prioritizing student safety, worrying that her statement somehow undermined the freedom of the press.
To be fair, some individuals on this Board became victims of a vicious doxxing campaign and received death threats from trolls online after our BDS editorial was published, so their concern about a free press is understandable. While doxxing and intimidation are inexcusable, President Johnson should not be held responsible for the actions of Internet trolls, and it is unfair to demand that she suppress her speech in anticipation of online extremists beyond her control.
The Board is wrong that administrators should curtail their own speech for the sake of editorial independence: Freedom of the press does not mean freedom from criticism. University presidents should be allowed to express their disagreement with student newspapers’ editorial stances, as long as they don’t actively censor what student newspapers write. President Johnson’s email, which, based on the publicized portions of the statement, does not threaten action against the paper or its writers, is mere criticism, not censorship. Robust dialogue — both in the press and in speech — is what allows our society to weigh different ideas and consider the nuances of complicated problems, so we should welcome President Johnson’s statement instead of denouncing it.
If our Board is willing to question a university president for merely disagreeing with students in an unthreatening manner, I am deeply concerned about the lack of debate on campus.
Our Board clarifies that they are not arguing for university presidents to always keep quiet on anything published by their students’ newspapers. Yet they then insist that when administrators do make such comments, they must include a statement reaffirming freedom of the press. This argument misses the point: By seriously engaging with our perspectives and presenting counter arguments, civil disagreements inherently imply a respect for freedom of the press. Are we so thin-skinned as to require a redundant clarification about press freedom before university administrators share their views?
Our Board writes that they support the Wellesley News’ right to make mistakes. While mistakes are inevitable, we should welcome their correction, rather than split hairs over how calls for those corrections are phrased. When we or the Wellesley News opine on a complicated conflict thousands of miles away — with important complexities and ramifications that we are duty-bound to reflect in our writing — we must allow ourselves to be held accountable and accept the blowback from those with whom we disagree.
Either we stand by our BDS editorial and welcome the criticism we receive. Or we retract it and admit that we made an error.
Which brings me to my second objection to today’s staff editorial: It is time to admit we were wrong about BDS.
Where in our April editorial did we mention the fact that Israelis live under constant fear of rocket fire from terrorist organizations that live on its borders? Where did we mention the numerous peace deals extended to the Palestinians that were rejected by their leadership? Where did we explain that Israeli-Arab citizens enjoy full legal rights in Israel and even sit in the Knesset and on the nation’s highest court? And where did we support the Jewish right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland in a country home to millions of Jews?
More importantly, beyond these material omissions, our BDS editorial was disgraceful for the double standard it applied to the Jewish state: Israel is the only country this Board has singled out to boycott in decades. At a time when countless nations around the world engage in heinous human rights abuses, this double standard is shameful.
I know my peers on the Editorial Board well enough to think it highly unlikely any of them personally harbor hatred of the Jewish people. However, that did not stop them from playing into the antisemitic tendency to isolate Israel from every other country in the world as worthy of a boycott.
This reprehensible double standard caused public figures to denounce our editorial from last April. It was likely this same double standard, now in the Wellesley News editorial, that prompted President Johnson’s response. Just as we exercised our first amendment right when we published our views on Israel, university administrators are perfectly justified when expressing their disapproval of our views.
Rather than hiding behind an imagined assault on freedom of the press, student Editorial Boards should welcome the critiques of well-intentioned individuals who express their disagreement with their positions. Perhaps if we are so concerned about press freedom and believe boycotts are a justified form of protesting human rights abuses, we should use our platform to call for boycotts against North Korea, Eritrea, Iran, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, and China — the world’s six worst countries for press freedom according to Reporters Without Borders.
While I wish we had never published our BDS editorial last semester, I will forever defend my peers’ right to publish their views. I just wish they would extend the same courtesy to their critics.

Threats to journalistic independence, doxxing, and controversial interferences from university presidents: A familiar storm is brewing at Wellesley College.
Earlier this term, the Wellesley News Editorial Board released an editorial calling for “the liberation of Palestine” and endorsing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. In doing so, our peers at Wellesley made praising reference to the “Mapping Project,” a controversial initiative spearheaded by Boston-area activists that digitally maps organizations with alleged ties to the occupation of Palestine and a variety of social ills.
The reaction was swift. Within days, Wellesley College President and Harvard alumna Paula A. Johnson ’80 had released an email on the matter bearing the subject line “Condemning Antisemitism.” After curtly noting Wellesley’s appreciation of the free press and her general policy against commenting on student editorials, Johnson stated that she did “feel the need to make it clear” that the college rejected the Mapping Project for promoting antisemitism.
Five days later, amid an eerily familiar wave of backlash featuring online harassment and social media doxxing of editorial members, the Wellesley News issued a clarification on its editorial. In this statement, the Editorial Board reaffirmed its opposition to antisemitism and antisemitic uses of the Mapping Project in particular, while explaining that the board had never intended to endorse the project in the first place.
Right-wing outlets gleefully celebrated Johnson’s “administrative smackdown,” publicizing the names and images of the involved editors even after the organization removed the editorial masthead from their website to reduce exposure. Some 60 sympathetic students and faculty, incensed by what they saw as a tacit encouragement of the harassment, staged a protest march toward Johnson’s house.
We don’t stand for or support the Mapping Project — neither, for that matter, does the unaffiliated Palestinian BDS National Committee. As student journalists, however, we firmly support the editors of the Wellesley News Editorial Board.
***
Let us address the elephant in the room: The Mapping Project is, at best, a clumsy, deeply inappropriate tool. At its worst, it has hugely dangerous potential, quite literally providing a map for those with ill or even violent intent to the front door of Jewish organizations across Massachusetts. The project strikes us as intellectually lazy and egregiously over-simplistic on Palestine and beyond, discarding opinion pieces critical of Russia as “US imperialist propaganda” while castigating entire Jewish social organizations regardless of their willingness to criticize the Israeli government.
That isn’t just bad reasoning — it’s awful advocacy, too.
We regard the Mapping Project, regardless of its intent, as antisemitic in effect and counterproductive to the efforts of Palestinian advocates, despite the theoretical utility of inspecting the links between American institutions and a variety of oppressive governments (Israel is hardly the only country with a dubious human rights track record and domestic supporters). The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is fraught; scars are easy to inflame. Historical antisemitism has implications for how we should discuss issues that get easily conflated with Judaism as a whole. That does not mean that we should avoid such debates, nor that we should spare any warranted criticism — as an Editorial Board, we have hardly done so ourselves. But engaging with this discussion does demand a high level of care, lest it amplify dangerous tropes, proving detrimental to the Palestinian cause.
The Mapping Project failed to clear such a bar — for that, we unambiguously denounce it.
Still, we are skeptical that the backlash at Wellesley is exclusively tied to the Mapping Project itself, and not to the students’ broader pro-Palestinian views on the delicate geopolitical conflicts of the region.
Our reasoning here is twofold. First, the editorial’s clumsy support for the Mapping Project was a short aside in a much longer piece focused on the wider BDS movement and its manifestations on Wellesley’s campus. Second, and more pressingly: We doubt that the barrage of hatred directed at Wellesley's editors is solely linked to the Mapping Project because we faced similar backlash ourselves — well before the project even existed.
***
In the weeks following the publication of our own sharply controversial pro-Palestine editorial, our board received hundreds of outraged, often vile, reactions. Some taunted our members with antisemitic slurs, comparing them to Schutzstaffel guards; others undermined Jewish editors’ identities, like the deputy mayor of Jerusalem who called one of our then-editors the “Jewish equivalent of the Uncle Tom” in a since-deleted tweet. Our entire board was abused via Instagram, where personal profiles were publicized to instigate harassment upon individuals; our leadership’s faces and full names still show up under widely-followed Twitter accounts with smearing descriptions. The very professors who hold substantial sway over our futures signed scorching open letters against us, and a certain former University president and U.S. secretary of the treasury did too, accusing us of “moral bankruptcy” and seeking to erode our editorial autonomy by calling on his hundreds of thousands of followers to boycott funding of our publication, which is financially independent from the uber-wealthy University we cover.
The hostile campaign wasn’t exactly enjoyable. Unlike Wellesley, we never removed our masthead from our site — but we were forced to erase the names of Editorial editors who simply did not want to continue their affiliation at such high risk of harassment. Indeed, that risk led our University’s administration, unprompted, to feel compelled to tighten our newspaper’s security through the University police department in the immediate aftermath of the editorial’s publication — a sickening, jarring development.
That adds a layer of twisted irony to the ongoing debacle. For the same reason that the Mapping Project is wrong, so is the backlash Wellesley News has faced: Both are vile, vitriolic intimidation laced with threats. We categorically reject any form of threats as a valid form of debate; we refuse to be strong-armed into silence. No one should harbor any doubt that journalism’s mission, student journalism’s mission, and The Crimson’s mission, is to relentlessly chase the truth and to guarantee the right to an opinion for all — even when the opinion is controversial; perhaps especially then.
***
To be clear, criticism is an essential exercise of free speech; the right to differ on questions of deep, fundamental importance belongs to the holders of dissentious views and their critics alike. But harassment is not commonplace criticism. To treat it as such entirely disregards foundational assumptions of safety and mutual respect without which we can have neither open discourse nor democracy. Speech can never be truly free if speakers face real fear of violent retribution. The press cannot be free if it writes before the barrel of a gun.
Freedom of the press, editorial independence, and the protection of dissenters are bedrock democratic principles that cannot be compromised — no matter how virulently the powerful or the public may disagree. In a democracy, the role of journalism is to examine everything — even things regarded as incontrovertible truths. Such a duty, and the protections that attach to it, must include opinion journalism, too.
Much as we strenuously disagree with the Mapping Project, we do not believe that our peer editors’ careless reference to it warranted the ensuing fallout. That Wellesley News acknowledged and clarified the mistake surely attests that it was operating in good faith. As such, and as fellow student journalists, they deserve grace.
When it comes to controversies involving the perspectives of student journalism, university administrators have an essential role to play. In our view, for a university president, the safety of students is an absolute, non-negotiable line in the sand. When considering whether to publicly condemn student journalists under real and material threat, that principle must triumph over other concerns.
We acknowledge that the calculus may not always be so clear-cut. Particularly when there is risk of harm to more than one party — for example, student populations on campus made to feel unsafe by the reference to a dangerous tool — balancing competing interests is difficult. But administrators’ official condemnation of a stance taken in a student editorial must come only, if ever, as a last resort. Whenever administrators do reach the decision to speak out, they must explicitly and unequivocally affirm the independence of the student press and their right to free speech while also considering the precarious well-being of student journalists.
To this extent, we reaffirm our appreciation for Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow’s careful actions this past Spring. Back then, Bacow officially commented on our own controversy only when prompted by direct, face-to-face questioning during a meeting despite presumably immense pressure; omitted mention of the Board from the title of the public statement about said comment; and emphasized his support for our editorial independence first and foremost.
We do not expect presidents to remain silent on issues of great import — quite the opposite, really. President Bacow said specifically that Harvard would never boycott a state, but that view came only at the end of a comment broadly centering support for freedom of the press. In this respect, he is a model for how university administrators should approach controversies involving the harassment of student journalists, and we thank him for it. President Johnson, who opted for an official school-wide email with a reductive reading of the editorial’s message, unnecessarily amplified the scrutiny and harassment on Wellesley student journalists — and thus falls short of what we expect from our university leadership.
Our democracy cannot survive without free speech and the free press. The events of last spring and this past month show us, vividly, that we cannot have either without the unequivocal protection of speakers. The pursuit of the truth through journalism is the sole, brilliant north star of this Board. And, come what may, we stand unwavering, uncowed, and unbroken in support of it — in Cambridge, in Wellesley, in Palestine, and everywhere.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study opened a new exhibit Monday on the history of abortion in the United States spanning the decades up the Supreme Court's reversal of its landmark Roe v. Wade decision.
Plans for the exhibit, entitled “The Age of Roe: The Past, Present, and Future of Abortion in America,” were altered this year in the wake of the Supreme Court’s controversial overturning of Roe v. Wade — which protected the constitutional right to abortion — through its June decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
Over the past two years, the Radcliffe Institute’s Schlesinger Library had worked to prepare an exhibit which would honor the fiftieth anniversary of Roe v. Wade in 2023. Prior to the court’s ruling in Dobbs, the library had planned to feature its “extensive collections that document the long and contentious struggle over women’s reproductive rights in the nation.”
Mary R. Ziegler ’04, the exhibit’s curator and a historian of reproductive health at the University of California Davis School of Law, wrote in an emailed statement that despite the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe, the exhibit’s intended purpose remains the same.
“We had planned the exhibit to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Roe and consider what Roe, broadly conceived, meant in ongoing struggles over reproduction in America,” Zielger wrote. “Now, obviously, Roe is no more, at least as a matter of black letter law.”
“We decided to pivot by looking back on the era that Roe had defined — and considering whether or even when it had ended,” she added. “But the purpose of the exhibit — to bring light instead of heat — and to invite viewers to encounter people whose lives had been intimately touched by abortion — did not change.”
Ziegler also wrote that the overturning of Roe reinforced the importance of creating the exhibit.
“If anything, in a world where abortion can once again be a crime, it seemed even more important to listen to the voices on the subject of abortion that we don’t always give our attention,” she wrote.
The Schlesinger Library’s exhibit features a variety of items related to women’s reproductive rights for the past century, including political buttons, postcards, letters, artwork, and images of prominent figures.
The exhibit will be on display at the Schlesinger Library until March 4, 2023. The Radcliffe Institute also plans to hold a conference on the exhibition and the state of abortion in America in January 2023.

Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics found that dark energy makes up two-thirds of the universe, according to a study published in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal last month.
The study, which also found that one-third of the universe is composed of mostly dark matter, confirms existing theories about the configuration of the universe, said Dillon Brout, an Einstein Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics and lead author of the research papers.
“It puts on even stronger footing our understanding of the acceleration of the universe — just how much it is accelerating — and what kinds of theories that can explain that acceleration, the best theory being dark energy,” Brout said. “We’ve essentially doubled our ability to constrain dark energy and the acceleration of the universe compared to the next best analysis of this kind.”
The analysis looks at more than 1,500 stellar explosions called supernovae. It also reveals that the cosmos have likely expanded at an accelerating rate for billions of years.
“Our analysis is kind of like a dream team of the different people and collaborations that have been conducting these supernova surveys,” Brout added.
The researchers decided to examine supernovae that were the closest to Earth. Setting constraints on the distance and volume of space in which they would search for supernovae, they drew from data collected in the past 30 years.
“We also include datasets that go all the way out into more than three-quarters of the way back to the Big Bang,” Brout said. “Indiscriminate, systematic searches which are really good for understanding dark energy.”
The project grew out of an original analysis of 1,000 supernovae that Dan M. Scolnic, an assistant professor of physics at Duke University, published in 2018. The newer version expands the dataset and refines techniques for analyzing supernovae data.
“We’ve recalibrated all of the surveys that we’ve analyzed and that was a really large effort,” Brout explained.“It was basically redoing a lot of the work that these surveys had already done because there have been improvements in various aspects on how you can calibrate telescopes over the last 30 years.”
Brout is now considering exploring how the Hubble constant — the current rate of the expansion of the universe — interacts with his measurements of the cosmos.
“Why doesn’t our measurement agree with the measurement made in the early universe? That is one huge outstanding question,” he said. “We’re hoping that this analysis really sparks the community into helping find a solution, whether that’s astrophysics, whether that’s systematic errors in one of the analyses.”
“And then of course, there’s the possibility that our whole model of the universe is wrong — and that’s the most exciting one,” Brout added.

WOBURN, Mass. — Attorneys for Harvard and the estate of Luke Z. Tang ’18, who died by suicide on campus in 2015, presented arguments for and against motions for the court to rule without a trial in a wrongful death lawsuit at a Tuesday hearing.
The lawsuit alleges that Harvard and some of its employees were negligent in their duty of care for undergraduate Luke Tang. The student’s father Wendell W. Tang filed the suit in 2018 in the Middlesex County Superior Court, which denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the following year.
In Tuesday’s hearing, Harvard argued the case should not go to a jury, while the Tang family’s attorney held that the University neglected its duty to provide care to Luke Tang after an April 2015 suicide attempt.
Both sides agreed that Harvard owed Luke Tang a duty of care, but Harvard disputed the claim that its employees neglected that duty.
The case charges the President and Fellows of Harvard College, Senior Resident Dean Catherine R. Shapiro, former Lowell Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03, and Counseling and Mental Health Services employee Melanie G. Northrop with negligence in Tang’s death.
Martin F. Murphy — who argued on behalf of Harvard, Shapiro, and Casey — referenced Nguyen v. MIT, a 2018 case in which the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that MIT was not liable for the death by suicide of a student.
The court outlined specific circumstances that must exist for a university to be held liable in a wrongful death lawsuit, including that the student informed university officials of suicidal ideation.
“When the court looks at what the SJC said the duty was in Nguyen, on the facts here — on the undisputed facts — there’s no basis for any liability on the part of Harvard, no basis of liability on the part of Dean Catherine Shapiro, Luke Tang’s freshman dean, or Dean Casey, Luke Tang’s dean his second year,” Murphy said.
Following Tang’s suicide attempt in April 2015, Harvard required him to enter into a contract in order to stay enrolled. The contract’s provisions required Tang to meet with a treatment team and comply with their recommendations.
The contract further required Tang to bring mental health concerns — including if he felt “distressed” or inclined to harm himself — directly to Harvard University Health Services or the local hospital rather than to his friends or clergy.
At Tuesday’s hearing, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Brent A. Tingle asked Murphy whether he thought the contract might have increased Tang’s likelihood of suicide.
“Putting aside satisfying the limited duty as articulated in Nguyen, couldn’t a new duty arise by virtue of entering into that type of contract, and in the plaintiff’s words, doing it in such a way that it increases the risk of harm to the student?” Tingle said.
Murphy said the contract was more accurately a “set of rules” for Tang, and Harvard was “acting in a way that was compassionate and reasonable” in their response to his mental health crisis.
“They went above and beyond what Nguyen required, and above and beyond what the contract required,” Murphy said. “They didn’t voluntarily undertake to exercise — to perform any services.”
During the hearing, David W. Heinlein, who represents the Tang family, argued against Harvard’s motion for summary judgment. He pointed to prior Superior Court judges’ rulings that Harvard’s interpretation of Nguyen was “erroneous” and cited the opinion of licensed clinical psychologist Thomas E. Joiner.
“Once a student is identified as being at risk, that suicide is preventable,” Heinlein said. “And under the facts of this case, Dr. Joiner, whose expert opinion you have, he says that if Harvard had adequate prevention protocols, then it is more likely than not that Luke Tang’s suicide would have been prevented.”
“That, in and of itself, warrants denial of this motion,” he added.
William J. Dailey III represented Northrop, who served as Tang’s case manager after his suicide attempt. As case manager, she was responsible for coordinating Tang’s mental health treatment and resources.
Dailey argued that because Tang did not reach out to Northrop when he returned to campus in August 2015, she did not have a duty to care for him.
“From [Northrop’s] perspective, she could literally never hear from him again the next three years of college and satisfy her duty?” Tingle asked Dailey.
“Yes, Your Honor,” Dailey said. “If Luke doesn’t reengage and no one raises a concern to her, absolutely.”
Following Dailey’s defense, Heinlein argued that Northrop did not “ensure continuity of care” or monitor Tang’s compliance with the provisions of the contract.
“When Melanie Northrop makes the argument, that ‘Well, I didn’t do anything because I didn't have any signs,’ I would respectfully submit that that’s not evidence of the lack of the duty,” Heinlein said. “That’s evidence of her breach.”
Tingle concluded the hearing after an hour and a half of arguments. He said he would take the case under advisement, a move which allows him to delay the announcement of his decision to consider the evidence.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College saw four burglaries — striking two units in Quincy House, a third in Adams House, and a fourth at 20 DeWolfe St. — over the Halloween weekend.
Students reported stolen laptops, tablets, and other belongings after a series of burglaries late Friday night and early Saturday morning, the Harvard University Police Department announced in a campus advisory Saturday evening.
In all four cases, the students’ dorms were accessed through unlocked or propped open doors, according to the HUPD advisory, which included a reminder for students to keep doors and windows locked at all times when not in their room.
Three of the burglaries took place while students were away from their dorms, the advisory noted, while in the fourth incident, a student reported seeing an unidentified male open their bedroom door.
This is the third cluster of burglaries to strike Harvard’s student residences this year. Five burglaries struck Harvard Yard in February and March, leading to the arrest of an individual suspected in three of the incidents. In July, three more break-ins took place in the Yard, also leading to an arrest.
Sami E. Turner ’25, who lives in a suite in DeWolfe, said she and her suitemates left their suite around 10 p.m. Friday night to attend a Halloween party and returned around 2 a.m., not noticing anything amiss.
But when she and her suitemate woke up early Saturday morning to complete a problem set, they found that their laptops and tablets had been stolen, along with several other belongings. Turner, a Crimson design editor, said the items were worth more than $10,000.
“We don’t feel safe in our dorm anymore,” Turner said. “It’s just really unsettling that someone was able to get in — I don’t even sleep with the lights fully off right now.”
Turner’s roommate Amira Singh ’25 said the suite would usually prop the door open in case one of them lost the key.
Singh added that she was able to track the thief’s location to Boston University using her laptop’s location services. But she said when she reported this information to Boston Police, she was told that nothing could be done.
Quincy House resident Alexandra N. Wilson ’23-’24 and her four suitemates also woke up Saturday morning to discover that three laptops, a tablet, and more than $300 in cash had been stolen from their dorm.
Wilson, a Crimson sports editor, noted that prior to the incident, she and her roommates had been using a piece of tape to keep the door open and said she was told by HUPD not to expect her items back.
Singh said that the University has not sufficiently improved security in response to burglaries targeting students, adding that the thefts of personal devices imposed a significant financial burden. She added that HUPD had not been helpful so far.
“They haven’t really done anything to help us. We just had to sort of deal with it on our own,” Singh said. “Even though we have the location, they’d just be like, ‘Oh, you can call the area police.’”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the story, citing a longstanding department policy to refrain from comment on active investigations.
Turner said she thinks 20 DeWolfe St. needs stronger security measures to prevent unauthorized entry, noting that elevator and stairwell access does not require a keycard.
The University declined a request for comment.
While recommending caution, HUPD noted in its advisory that burglaries of student residences are relatively uncommon. The department’s annual security report cited 16 burglaries on Harvard’s Cambridge campus in 2021.
According to the HUPD advisory, all four incidents remain under investigation. The department has yet not determined whether the burglaries are connected.

About 21 percent of respondents to a survey of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences said they have personally experienced harassment or discrimination at the school, according to data released last month.
The figure, which marks a 6 percentage-point drop from 2018, is highest among non-ladder faculty and respondents from historically marginalized racial and gender identities.
About 43 percent of non-ladder faculty respondents reported that they have experienced discrimination. Thirty-four percent of Black or African American respondents and 34 percent of transgender and nonbinary respondents reported having experienced discrimination.
The survey also found disparities based on racial and gender identity, disability status, and role at SEAS across a range of issues, including implicit bias, inclusion and belonging, and stress.
The data was released as part of SEAS’ 2022 campus climate survey. The survey — distributed to all 2,471 SEAS faculty, students, staff, postdoctoral fellows, and researchers — garnered 604 complete responses. It is the second climate survey SEAS has conducted and the first since 2018.
The survey, which measured eight “themes” by grouping survey questions together, saw at least some improvement from 2018 levels across six categories: experiencing harassment, witnessing harassment, accessibility, experience with bias, engagement with DIB experiences, and confidence to use diversity, inclusion, and belonging tools.
Two themes — feelings of inclusion and belonging and work and family balance — stayed flat, on average, from 2018.
The survey results tell a “complicated story” but show “clear signs of improvement,” said Paula Nicole Booke, SEAS’s new assistant dean for diversity, inclusion, and belonging.
“We are definitely interested in substantial improvement,” Brooke said. “We are not going to be happy with our results. We’re always going to work to move forward and to create more consistent experiences for all members of the SEAS community.”
The most common forms of harassment and discrimination included derogatory, embarassing, or humiliating gestures and remarks; unfair comments in a SEAS work environment; and bullying by another SEAS affiliate, according to the report. Nearly 63 percent of respondents who faced harassment indicated that it predominantly came from faculty, staff or administrators.
Among respondents who experienced harassment and discrimination, 47 percent said they considered leaving SEAS, 58 percent considered leaving Harvard altogether, and 56 percent considered discouraging others from joining SEAS.
The vast majority of respondents who experienced harassment or discrimination did not report their experiences, according to the survey. Among those who did, 47 percent indicated they were “not satisfied” with the school’s response.
Women, people who identify as an underrepresented minority, people with a disability, and LGBTQ+ individuals reported “more experiences indicative of implicit bias,” according to a comparison of mean responses.
Overall, only 25 percent of respondents reported that they “felt positively supported to encounter diverse people, ideas, and experiences through SEAS.”
Only 36 percent reported that they felt “inclusion and belonging” at the school — consistent with 2018 levels. White, male, and heterosexual respondents indicated reporting the highest rates of belonging at the school.
This report marks the first time SEAS has released inclusion and belonging data since its historic move to the new Science and Engineering Complex across the Charles River in Allston, where approximately 50 percent of faculty and staff are now based. Sentiments about belonging and work-life balance varied based on where respondents spent the majority of their time.
Individuals who spent their time between the Allston and Cambridge campuses reported higher levels of work stress than the overall figure. Forty-three percent of respondents who spend most of their time in Allston “reported strongly agreeing with sentiments of inclusion and belonging” at SEAS, compared to 31 percent of those who work mostly in Cambridge.
Despite the pandemic, attitudes toward work-life balance remained consistent between 2018 and 2022. About 30 percent of respondents strongly agreed that they have work-life balance.
Stress regarding work-life balance, however, varied by identity. Women, self-identified underrepresented minorities, people with a disability, and LGBQA+ individuals reported facing more stress than their peers. Undergraduates and Ph.D. students had the highest levels of work stress compared to SEAS overall.
The lowest reported work-life satisfaction was in the responses to the availability of childcare at Harvard.
SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III wrote in a letter included in the report that releasing the survey results is a “first step.” The school plans to compile further qualitative data through additional “focus groups and informational gatherings,” he wrote.
Booke, the DIB associate dean, said the conversation series will allow affiliates to “share out their perspectives,” refine SEAS’s strategic plan for DIB, and “really direct the change that the community as a whole seeks to create.”
“I really want to create a sense where everyone feels like they can be in dialogue with every other member of the SEAS community,” she said. “That’s one of the chief goals that I have in my role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ended fiscal year 2022 with an $84.9 million surplus, according to a presentation by administrators during a faculty meeting Tuesday.
This year’s surplus marks an increase from the $51.3 million surplus the FAS reported at the end of fiscal year 2021. The dean’s unrestricted reserved funds increased to $159 million, meeting the University’s recommended threshold of 10 percent of the school’s annual operating expenses for the first time in FAS history.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay said the results suggest the FAS is “an institution that has been resilient through the headwinds of the pandemic.”
As recommended in the FAS Study Group’s fall 2021 report, the school has also hired its first strategic director for endowment and gifts,  FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Scott A. Jordan announced Tuesday. Gay convened the group in November 2020 to examine the school’s “​​financial sustainability, organizational flexibility, institutional resilience.”
In June, FAS leadership — in concert with Economics faculty members — updated its economic budgeting model based on numbers from fiscal year 2021, Jordan said. The new model adjusted the budget for inflation to assess the school’s long-term financial condition.
According to this new model, Jordan said the FAS is projected to be “in a deficit position of $600 million.”
He added that the FAS is “fiscally healthy” right now, but that the school will still need to monitor factors within its control, such as fundraising, compensation, and management of local funds.
“With the University in a relatively healthy financial position and with the FAS in a good position, market volatility and an uncertain economy will require us to be financially prudent as we go forward,” Jordan said. “But we’re in a good place, and we expect to be resilient and to have resources for the strategic work ahead.”
During the meeting Tuesday, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser also shared results of the annual faculty trends report, which included data on faculty searches, tenure reviews, and diversity.
According to the report, the FAS conducted 71 ladder faculty searches in the 2021-2022 academic year and made 59 offers — 29 to women and 30 to people of color. The FAS granted tenure to nine of the 10 ladder faculty it reviewed.
Zipser shared during the meeting that the size of ladder faculty has largely remained the same since 2009, while the non-ladder faculty has grown by 44 percent since 2003.
“The FAS’s plan is to strategically grow the ladder faculty while keeping the non-ladder faculty relatively flat,” the report reads.
There are proportionately more women among tenure-track and non-ladder faculty than among tenured faculty, per the report. Only 29 percent of tenured faculty are women, compared to 47 percent and 48 percent of tenure-track and non-ladder faculty, respectively.
Though this year’s annual report contains only binary gender statistics, Zipser said the University has begun to collect data on nonbinary gender statistics this year.
Tenure-track faculty are also significantly more racially and ethnically diverse compared to non-ladder or tenured faculty.
Though 19 percent of U.S. Ph.D. recipients in 2021 identified as historically underrepresented, only 7.2 percent of FAS tenure-track position applicants identified as part of this group. The report defines historically underrepresented as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, American Indian/Alaskan Native, or two or more races.

Members of the Harvard Graduate Council voted in favor of a resolution declaring support for the people of Iran on behalf of the University’s graduate students at their Monday night meeting.
The statement passed alongside another resolution calling for the creation of more university-wide student groups. A resolution in support of affirmative action was tabled. Board members and representatives also approved the 2022-2023 fiscal year budget for the body and continued planning a Harvard-Yale tailgate for graduate students.
Janan Iranbomy, HGC chair of student advocacy and engagement, presented the resolution on Iran.
“I find it symbolic that we are gathered at the Harvard Divinity School for today's meeting. One of the core values of the divinity school is respect and dignity for others,” she said. “And with that spirit – for respecting the dignity of others — I hope you can all vote in favor of this resolution for freedom and justice in Iran.”
Pointing to a vigil and teach-in at Harvard Law School, Iranbomy said that the goal of the resolution is to “align the actions” taken by graduate students across the University in support of Iranian people with a unified written statement.
Other students questioned the purpose of the resolution and what the support it promises might look like in action.
“Beyond your communication, where does this go, and what further action do you require from us?” asked Harvard School of Public Health student Idongesit Sampson.
Christopher H. Cleveland ’14 – chair of the student advisory committee to Harvard’s presidential search committee – joined the beginning of the meeting. He presented several questions from the survey distributed by the student advisory committee.
The Council approved a larger-than-normal budget for fiscal year 2022-2023, with projected expenditures totalling $97,500. Of their revenue, $16,446 stems from a carryover of the 2021-2022 budget.
Carlos A. Gonzalez Sierra, president of the Council, referenced a lack of social events in the previous year due to Covid-19 health precautions as a reason to spend more on events this year.
“We have some carryover funds, and I think it's important to allocate those especially on events that bring the graduate student community together because largely, the reason we have a carryover is because there weren't many events last year,” he said.
The budget includes $8,400 for executive board honorariums, a set of stipends for the body’s leadership. The Council previously approved the stipends, which are a standard practice across the graduate student councils of several other Ivy League schools.
Board members provided updates on initiatives such as a graduate student intramural sports league and a cross-school mentorship program. The Council also discussed plans for the graduate student Harvard-Yale tailgate, ultimately deciding to limit ticket sales to current students, excluding significant others and graduate school alumni.
The first round of 100 tickets sold out fewer than 10 minutes after their release at noon on Tuesday. One hundred more are set to be released on Friday.

In spring 2022, Mick Cusimano stepped onto the stage at the Boston International Film Festival to three standing ovations. He had been hospitalized for brain cancer just weeks before, but he had recovered enough to present a screening of his film at the festival.
Cusimano, 71, died of cancer on July 23. He dubbed himself “the professor of surrealism” and had a deep passion for history, arts, poetry, and film, his friends recalled.
Daniel Cusimano, Mick’s brother, said he started creating cartoons which depicted their cub scout adventures at the age of seven. By elementary school, Mick Cusimano developed a passion for Egyptian, Greek and Classical Roman history. He especially enjoyed learning about Cleopatra, who later became a subject of many of his films and animations.
While on a work trip to Boston in the 1980s, Cusimano saw a hiring post for security guards at the Harvard Art Museums. Cusimano, a Buffalo, New York, native, took the job and “never looked back,” his brother said.
“It was paradise to him,” Daniel Cusimano said. “I could not visit him without going to the Harvard Art Museum.”
“He was always, always proud of that connection,” he added.
At Harvard, Cusimano continued to pursue his interest in the arts, delving into film and animation by taking 16 classes at the Extension School. In addition, he began illustrating cartoons for The Crimson in 2013, many of which addressed political themes. Cusimano also worked as a live caricature artist at parties, college events, and bar mitzvahs in the Boston area.
Ansis Purins, a friend and co-worker of Cusimano’s for 18 years, said Cusimano “wasn’t like a boss” and was “more like a friend,” recalling how he would sometimes start sketching in his notepad once all mail was delivered.
“Mick was a very unusual, individualistic person, he had his own style,” Purins said. “If he had been a bit younger, he would have been a punk rocker or a hippie or a Beatnik.”
Poet Richard Cambridge became close friends with Cusimano after meeting him at a poetry coffeehouse in Allston in 1990. The two would travel around Cambridge and perform stand-up poetry together, he said.
“Mick had a very unique way of looking at the world,” Cambridge said. “It was like a kaleidoscopic eye. He would see things differently.”
As technology progressed, Cusimano began animating his cartoons and later incorporating live performance and graphics into his movies.
Cusimano is survived by his eight siblings. His friends and family are hosting a Nov. 11 memorial for in Somerville.
After Cusimano was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2018, he often said to Cambridge that the disease “only got to the real part” of his brain, not the “surreal part.”
Despite battling brain cancer for more than three years, Cambridge said Cusimano continued to pursue his passion for film.
“In those three years, he made really good use of his time,” Cambridge said. “He got right through surgery and got right back to work. Whenever his radiation therapy, he just kept going. It was real inspiration in a very modest way.”

WASHINGTON — Salimah Khoja, a law student at the City University of New York School of Law, first arrived outside the Supreme Court Saturday evening in hopes of securing a spot at Monday’s hearing.
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday for a pair of lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. The group alleges that the schools’ admissions programs are unconstitutional for their consideration of race.
On Saturday, Khoja learned only the first 50 people in line would be admitted to view oral arguments at Monday’s hearing. The queue had not yet begun forming, so Khoja and her friends checked back periodically.
They were ultimately the first in line.
“We wanted to make sure that we would be guaranteed a spot, and so we started forming the line,” she said.
As lawyers representing Harvard, UNC, and SFFA prepared to deliver their oral arguments before the court, swarms of eager students descended on Washington this weekend for the chance to watch history unfold.
Three undergrads from George Washington University — who arrived outside the court Sunday evening — said they were relieved the line was not longer. By the time they arrived, roughly 15 people were stationed outside.
“For really, really big cases, people line up Saturday 5 p.m. for a Monday case,” said Reeya Patel, one of the students. “So we came to check it out yesterday, and there was nobody, absolutely nobody here.”
Jack A. Shapiro, a student from the University of Maryland, messaged two of his friends from high school and recruited three friends from UMD to spend the weekend in D.C.
“[Shapiro] sent me a text message about a month ago — three weeks ago — [that] said, ‘Hey, you want to camp out at the Supreme Court?’ Sounded like a blast,” said Matthew B. Eichen, one of Shapiro’s friends, who attends the University of Pennsylvania.
Shapiro and his five friends had arrived outside the court at 10:30 a.m on Sunday.
“We wanted to get there really early, because we thought there'd be a giant line,” said Jonathan R. Xu, one of the students. “I mean, there's a lot of people here but the line’s kind of developing.”
Line sitters traveled from across the country and around the world.
“Americans have such a different relationship to the law,” said Clémence Pautrat, an exchange student from the French university Sciences Po. “You sue for everything.”
Many campers came prepared to spend hours in line, with some donning sleeping bags and others lawn chairs. The Supreme Court did not permit people to bring tents.
Others were less prepared.
“Not everybody planned so well. We didn't bring any sleeping bags,” Gavin O’Malley, a student from American University. “Some people forgot chairs.”
Shapiro remarked on the physical state the campout left many attendees in.
“It's kind of sad because I feel like the Supreme Court is this super dignified, formal institution. But any civilian who gets in is going to be sweaty, tired, hungry,” Shapiro said. “So we're gonna do our best to freshen up but it's all right.”
Some attendees considered the sacrifices worth it. By 7 a.m. Monday, the line stretched around the block as dozens of pro-affirmative action protesters began rallying on the steps to the court.
Many of the sidewalk-dwellers passed the time chatting with one another.
“The single greatest feature of lining up to watch a Supreme Court case is talking to strangers,” Shapiro said. “I mean, literally, we got law students. This guy teaches at Johns Hopkins. I saw a guy walking by who has a Ph.D., who works for NASA, lives around the corner. This guy is an alum of UNC.”
“You meet all sorts of people. And that's the beauty of coming out here,” he said.

While some Harvard students said they were disillusioned with the College’s party scene, several students fashioned their own ways to find joy over Halloweekend.
This year’s countdown to the last week of October conjured high spirits in the freshman class. In advance of the second in-person Halloween weekend since the Covid-19 pandemic sent students home in March 2020, freshmen painted pumpkins in a study break in Annenberg Hall — whose balcony sported a giant inflatable eyeball — and participated in competitive pumpkin decorating.
Some international students said they were surprised by the intensity of Halloween festivities in the United States. Taylor R. Browning ’26, who hails from the United Kingdom, said Harvard’s celebrations were far more extravagant than what he had observed back home.
“It definitely felt like you couldn’t escape it for the past couple of days,” he said.
Hugo L. M. Hinze ’26 said the holiday was particularly exciting for freshmen because they were in a new place, surrounded by new friends.
“I felt like it was very high energy,” he said.
Other students appreciated Halloweekend because of the brief respite it provided amid a chaotic semester.
“The bits I enjoyed most were honestly, at the end, going back to the common room and talking to people or going to get food,” Browning said. “Those were the highlights for me.”
Cesarina E. Marte ’26 said she enjoyed spending time with friends, especially after “the very stressful midterm season.”
But for a handful of freshmen, the party-filled weekend they had planned did not live up to their expectations.
Simone I. Peña ’26, who attended Currier House’s annual Heaven and Hell party as well as a Cabot House party before leaving early, called both functions “hot, smelly, and sweaty.”
Chrissy M. Cadigan ’26 escaped the confines of the Yard to party with friends at Columbia University.
“They all have clubs that they know they can get into and will go to every weekend,” Cadigan said of Columbia students. “It’s so fun. I’m so jealous.”
“I’m most looking forward to being an upperclassman for Halloweekend because I just feel like there’s so much more to go to for that,” she added. “Just because you’re all settled and you have more security with who your friends are, where you’re going, all that stuff.”
Jeremy S. Laue ’26 echoed Cadigan’s anticipation of becoming a party-savvy upperclassman.
“I am looking forward to the privacy as we move a little bit farther out and the security of already knowing that I've established these friends,” Laue said.
On Halloween night, a Jordan Peele horror movie marathon drew students hoping to fit in one final spook before midnight. The event, hosted by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, screened all three films from the director — “Get Out” (2017), “Us” (2019), and “Nope” (2022) — and served attendees candy from different cultures.
Jett M. Strayhorn ’25, an intern at the Foundation, said the event was organized to “gather people around and appreciate an artist of color.”
Even though some freshmen found the festivities lacking compared to their expectations, many students said they still enjoyed their first Halloween on campus.
“People are so hyped up about it. And they’re really excited about Halloween, which made it exciting,” Marte said. “That was the nice thing — just being able to be excited all together, chatting about something and not judging each other and just celebrating together.”

This Halloweekend, Harvard students showed up (we’re all try-hards after all). In case you were too drunk busy to pay attention to the costumes around you, Flyby crowdsourced the best Halloween costumes spotted this weekend, because we have eyes everywhere and gotta give credit where credit is due. Keep reading to see if you made the top costumes of 2022. And don’t cry if you didn’t.
Nicole Kidman in the AMC Ad
Somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like the Advo party.
Life Gives You Lemons
Shoutout to the girl with the “Life” nametag who held a basket of lemons for the entire night — you rock.
Sophia Grace and Rosie
Relevant and up-to-date with the pregnancy belly!
Tom Brady and the Divorce Papers
Trading in his marriage for football… only to un-divorce forty days later?
Ginger-Bread Man
While low in effort, the elite creativity of a ginger man holding a loaf of HUDS bread puts this one on our list.
The House from UP
Repurposing an Amazon box + tasteful decor = cardboard house with balloons, also known as an excellent costume seen at the Crimween party.
Fire and Ice Dance from Blades of Glory
Whoever you two are, points for making us all want to rewatch this iconic film.
Gluttony
Many groups of seven deadly sins were to be spotted this spooky weekend. However perhaps the best was a (failed) attempt at wearing a Trader Joe’s bag. Flyby knows all too well that having a Trader Joe’s in walking distance is a sin as far as our wallets are concerned.
Inflatable Shark Costumes
Just to give you a sense of how iconic these were, here are some Overheards at Flyby:
“One of them took their head off and looked back and my roommate gasped and said, ‘And they’re good-looking too!’”
“Nothing tops the sharks.”
Sections
Here at Flyby, we believe you are never too old to do anything — this includes trick-or-treating. In fact, we believe it’s even more fun to go trick-or-treating as a full-fledged adult, because no one can stop you from eating too much candy and falling into a candy coma. #adulting. Thus, in the name of journalism, we donned our costumes, grabbed our tote bags (since we couldn’t find trick-or-treat baskets) and headed into the wonderful neighborhoods of Cambridge in pursuit of tricks and treats.
To set the scene…
6:18 p.m. - Tina leaves from Mather in her pirate costume to find Alex at Paine Hall
6:38 p.m. - Tina arrives at Paine Hall; meets with Alex; starts trek to the Quad where Alex lives #quadlife <3
6:40 p.m. - Tina thinks they are lost, but Alex reassures her that this is her usual daily commute back to the Quad
6:48 p.m. - Tina and Alex arrive at the Quad; Alex starts to put on her cowboy costume
6:57 p.m. - Tina and Alex head out and the trick-or-treating festivities begin
At first, we were kind of nervous about ringing people’s doorbells. This was Alex’s first time trick-or-treating in the U.S., and Tina’s first time going door-to-door trick-or-treating, so there was somewhat of an ~activation barrier~ to overcome. The first house on our list was Dean Khurana’s — but all lights were off, and we chickened out. #missedconnections…or so we thought.
We kept asking ourselves, What’s the worst that could happen? We were just two college kids, walking around in search of candy in the name of journalism. If people judge us, oh well, candy is candy. Tina lives in Mather, so she realized she didn’t care if people living near the Quad judged her anyways. With that mindset, we started ringing doorbells.
7:03 p.m. - We ring the doorbell to our first house. Well, more like we grab a piece of candy from a bowl on the front porch and bolt away before anyone sees. But, a win is a win. First candy secured. Tina got a Kit-Kat, Alex got a Snickers.
At this point, our activation barrier has been overcome and our adrenaline has kicked in. Nothing can stop us now. We zig-zag through the streets, hitting as many houses in a block as we can. We follow any children we see (not creepily), since they seem like a good indication of which houses to target. Alex yells at a rude driver who doesn’t stop at a crosswalk. As she should.
7:06 p.m. - Someone asks Alex how old she is. She says 21 and gets embarrassed. Luckily, we find and merge with another group of Harvard students who are also out trick-or-treating. Great minds think alike. Their costumes are space bunny, snow bunny, and sailor. Shoutout to them.
7:08 p.m. - Kind woman living in a well-decorated house gives us candy, is delighted to find out we are college kids from the area and welcomes us back for Christmas caroling. She lures us with the promise of hot cocoa and cookies. A new idea is born — Flyby Tries: Christmas Caroling???
7:19 p.m. - We continue in pursuit of more sweets. One house just has a bowl of Hershey kisses and a pile of chocolate-covered pretzels on the stoup. Tina says, “Is this safe?” Alex cautiously advises, “We probably shouldn’t eat those…” But, it’s too late since Tina has already eaten one. It was very yummy.
7:21 p.m. - We get slightly scared by a man sitting on his porch steps playing a reading of Dracula. But he shows us some beautiful pumpkins his kids carved, and lets us take 3 pieces of candy each, so we get over our fear pretty quickly.
7:32 p.m. - You may be wondering, why did we choose to trick-or-treat around the Quad? Well, while there are many possible answers, but only one that is truly correct: Elizabeth Warren. Lives. Near. the. Quad. While we did have to wait in a line to walk up to her porch, Senator Warren not only gave us candy but agreed to take a photo with us all!
7:46 p.m. - The night did not end here. We decide to bring the night full-circle, and return to Dean Khurana’s house. Chocolate: secured. More importantly, Instagram feature: secured.
7:55 p.m. - We call the night a success, marking the end of our trick-or-treating adventure. Tina struggles to find the shuttle stop at the Quad. Sigh.
Highlights of the night:
Halloween stamps. No explanation needed.
One woman ran out of candy and gave out trinkets such as seashells and crystals. Not as tasty, but sooo pretty.
FULL SIZE CANDY BARS!! A man fully pulled out a platter of giant Hershey’s chocolate bars (think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory golden ticket chocolate bars) and insisted we all take one.
Elizabeth Warren. No explanation needed
Dean Khurana. No explanation needed.
Closing Thoughts:
TC: Absolutely doing this again next year. It was so fun getting to relive this part of childhood, trick-or-treating should just be normalized for everyone, no matter the age. I freed up my entire evening for this, and it did not disappoint. Heck, I even walked all the way from Mather to the Quad for this. Absolutely no regrets, I have soooo much candy to last me through the rest of this semester. Maybe Cambridge isn’t so bad after all…
AAK: Crazy amounts of free candy? Meeting cool people? Walking around spookily and beautifully decorated Cambridge mansions? Turns out I am a fan of all of these things. Trick-or-treating exceeded expectations – definitely doing this again next year and will not be embarrassed to admit how old I am again. Kudos to Tina for trekking to the Quad – ah, the things we do for Flyby.
