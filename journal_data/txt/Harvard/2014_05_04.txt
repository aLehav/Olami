After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 5, 2014, at 2:09 a.m.
Students at the Kennedy School of Government gathered in the school’s courtyard on Friday for a “moment of solidarity” in support of a movement lobbying the school’s administration to create a mandatory orientation program to help incoming students and faculty better recognize and address race and gender in the classroom.
The movement, called HKS Speaks Out, began in October after students expressed having “really negative classroom experiences,” according to Reetu D. Mody, a first year Master in Public Policy student and an organizer of the movement. She said the group has amassed about 300 student signatures, or about a fourth of the school’s student population, on a petition that calls for mandatory privilege and power training.
At Friday’s event, about 80 students participated in an exercise to visualize the differences in privilege created by race and gender. The students began in a single line, but as students were asked to step forward or backward based on questions about the social repercussions of their socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and sexual identities, the line became disjointed.
Mody said that she felt the event brought the students together to share their varying backgrounds and, in doing so, demonstrated the need for greater training on the issue.
 
In response to the movement, the school’s diversity committee met with the group’s organizers to hear their concerns, Kennedy School spokesman Doug Gavel wrote in an email, adding that these discussions “have been extremely productive and constructive.”
Additionally, Melodie Jackson, senior associate dean for degree programs and student affairs, “has committed to integrating diversity training into student orientation and the school is currently exploring a variety of different training options,” Gavel wrote.
Mody organized “speak out” sessions last fall after being disappointed by classes that “didn’t really address race at all” when considering systemic policy issues. The sessions allowed Mody's fellow classmates to discuss their frustrations freely; the first session drew about 80 of her peers, she said.
At the sessions, many students expressed that the power dynamics in the classroom hurt their experience and limited their education, according to Mody.
“To have these discussions where we are not being challenged is very detrimental to our ability to be thoughtful policy makers,” Mody said. “Coming here and not getting an education to support that has been really difficult.”
Out of these community conversations, the group decided that students and faculty needed to have a better understanding of “race, gender, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, ability, religion, international status, and power differentials,” prior to entering classroom discussions, according to the movement’s open letter to the Kennedy School community.
“You can either go to a diversity talk, or you can go play soccer–that was our orientation.” Mody said, of last year’s orientation.
For Michelle A. Millar, a first year student at the Kennedy School, the status quo limits the amount of unique voices in the classroom.
“We just can’t learn when we are only hearing from one side,” Millar said. “It’s hard to get that perspective if our professors aren’t trained to…make [classrooms] a safe place.”

UPDATED: April 5, 2014, at 12:03 a.m.
The Harvard Alumni Association has named Philip W. Lovejoy as its next executive director, the University announced Thursday. Lovejoy, who has served as the HAA’s deputy executive director since October 2007, will replace John “Jack” P. Reardon ’60, who announced in December that he would step down on July 1.
As executive director, Lovejoy will oversee a staff of more than 40 employees who together coordinate a range of alumni engagement activities, including reunion events during Commencement and the work of Harvard Clubs and other alumni groups worldwide.
Lovejoy, who called his promotion “wicked exciting” in an interview on Friday afternoon, came to Harvard in 1998 as the director of external affairs for the Harvard Museum of Natural History, and made the jump to the HAA in 2004. At the HAA, he  has overseen the organization’s travel program and the launch of a branch of HarvardX, called AlumniX, which delivers restricted course content to alumni to promote their engagement.
A graduate of Trinity College in Connecticut, Lovejoy, whose father graduated from the College in 1951, called Harvard a constant presence in his upbringing and “just my ethos.” Lovejoy said that his lack of a Harvard degree has never been a problem in his work at the HAA and that he did not expect it to become an issue in his new role.
“I don’t see it as a problem,” Lovejoy said. “I think my job here is to work with our volunteers, who are the true leaders.” He added that he feels that not having a degree from any one school allows him to articulate a holistic vision of the HAA, which, though sometimes dominated by graduates of Harvard’s most prominent schools, is a University-wide alumni association.
With Harvard’s first University-wide capital campaign since the turn of the century in full swing, Lovejoy said that he is excited to take the reigns of the HAA at a time when alumni engagement is high.
“Its a huge opportunity. We’ve been working for a few years to position the HAA to play a role in the campaign,” he said.
Reardon, who has been at Harvard since 1965 and served as the HAA’s executive director since 1990, will remain involved with University fundraising and Ivy League athletic affairs, hailed Lovejoy’s promotion.
“This is a wonderful appointment,” Reardon said in HAA’s press release. “Philip has done a spectacular job as deputy executive director. He has initiated a number of new programs during his tenure, and he has built excellent relationships with our staff and with our alumni. He brings great personal strengths to this role.”
University President Drew G. Faust echoed Reardon’s optimism.
“Philip will unquestionably build on Jack’s extraordinary stewardship that enables the HAA to convene thousands of alumni to engage and connect,” she said in the release.

Two Faculty of Arts and Sciences postdoctoral fellows presented their research at the first Global American Studies Symposium in the Barker Center on Friday afternoon.
Allan E. S. Lumba opened the symposium with a talk on his upcoming book, "Monetary Authorities: Economic Policy and Policing in the American Colonial Philippines." He focused on the shifting relations between race, money, and empire in American-occupied Philippines in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Shifting ahead to the twenty-first century, Elizabeth Mesok focused on female U.S. marines and the critical role they played in the U.S. counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. In her talk, titled “Warring Subjects: Gender, Liberalism, and U.S. Global Counterinsurgency,” Mesok used three case studies to argue that these female service women inhabited “multiple gendered identities not explainable solely through the binary of masculine and feminine.”
These presentations culminated the first year of the postdoctoral fellowship in Global American Studies offered by the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History. 
Launched last year by History professor Walter Johnson and other Warren Center affiliates, the fellowship was designed to fill the void of globally-oriented work within Harvard’s existing American Studies graduate program.
“Harvard wanted to try to imagine a set of questions around ethnic studies and imperialism and empire that weren’t being addressed by American Studies,” Johnson said. “We wanted to create a space where this kind of work would flourish.”
For Johnson and the Warren Center, the 300 applications they received for the two spots in the upcoming 2014-2015 school year indicate the appeal of Global American Studies as an academic field of study.
Before their presentations, each of the fellows met with leading scholars from other universities in seminars to workshop their manuscripts. The Warren Center set up these seminars to give the fellows extremely detailed feedback to help propel their projects forward. For Johnson, these seminars are an essential part of the give-and-take he sees in the program.
“We take young talented scholars not only to expose their ideas to Harvard, but also to give them access to Harvard’s resources to push their careers along,” Johnson said.
Lumba and Mesok spent the year not only furthering their research and developing their projects, but also each teaching an undergraduate course related to their work.
Lindsey A. Claus ’16, a student in Lumba’s course on global capitalism, attended the lecture to hear more extensively about the ideas Lumba presented in the fall. For Claus, the global perspective of Lumba’s research provides an unconventional yet interesting lens to understand political and economic possibilities.
“In this country we are so constrained within the narrow discourse of specific political parties,” Claus said. “Lumba’s work is really interesting because it gets outside of this binary and considers other possibilities for political transformation.”

As flowers begin to peak out on campus, many of Harvard’s most recognizable sculptures have also emerged from their winter covers—just in time for a tour of the Yard’s public art works, hosted by Harvard Art Museums on Friday.
“I am interested in the life of objects,” said Francesca G. Bewer, the research curator who shared details about the artists, materials, and history behind the sculptures. “I am interested in how things are made, and I think other people are too.”
The sculpture tour started with one of Bewer’s personal favorite sculptures on campus, “Large Four Piece Reclining Figure” by Henry Moore, which can be found outside of Lamont Library. Erected in the early 1970s, the abstract bronze statue is the twin of another sculpture in San Francisco.
Bewer also pointed out the “Onion,” a wrought-iron sculpture outside of Pusey Library, and highlighted the inscribed marble pillar resting on the back of a Chinese dragon outside of Boylston Hall. The sculpture is a Chinese stele donated to Harvard in 1936 to celebrate the University’s 300th anniversary. The inscription, which Bewer read aloud, commends the role of Harvard in the world and extolls the benefits of higher education.
After briefly pointing out the “three lies” of the John Harvard statue—namely, the man pictured is not John Harvard, John Harvard did not found the University, and Harvard was not founded in 1638—Bewer concluded the tour with the mural in the Science Center.
The Harvard Art Museums offered the sculpture tour as part of their Harvard Treasures Tour series, which also features tours of various Harvard library collections, photography exhibitions and museums throughout the academic year.
“We walk by these sculptures all the time, so it is nice to finally learn more about each one,” said Jeannie A. Ingram, associate director of fellows and membership at the Harvard Art Museums, who attended the tour.
Cambridge residents and retired Harvard affiliates were among those who participated in Friday’s sculpture tour.
“It’s a great opportunity to learn something new about my Harvard neighbor,” said Lindsay L. Griemann, a resident of Cambridge.
Upcoming events for the Harvard Art Museums include a day trip to visit parks and landscapes on May 16 and the annual Afternoon with the Director on June 7 where attendees can learn more about the current renovations to the art museums.

With more than 225 events over four days this weekend, the Arts First Festival celebrated the talents of Harvard students and faculty in the performance and visual arts.
According to the Arts First website, about half of Harvard’s undergraduate population took part in the festival, which lasted from Thursday to Sunday. Most students who participated performed in various events that were free and open to the public.
“[Arts First] is a great way to express to the broader Cambridge community just how many different kinds of arts groups there are here,” General Manager of the Krokodiloes Ben J. Marek ’14 said. “It’s really great to have the arts so visible for a weekend.”
One highlight of the weekend’s festivities came on Thursday when the Harvard Arts Medal, presented annually to a Harvard or Radcliffe alum who has shown excellence in the arts, was awarded to author, poet, and environmental activist Margaret Atwood. Past recipients of this honor include Matt Damon (’88-’92), Tommy Lee Jones ’69, and Yo Yo Ma ’76. 
Also on the docket for Thursday were a number of theatrical performances. Audiences in the Radcliffe Yard were treated to a student-written production from the Sunken Garden Children’s Theater which has been putting on shows geared towards the children of the Cambridge community for more than 15 years.


Later that evening, the annual freshman musical opened in the Agassiz Theatre. This year’s installment, titled “Hero,” was written by Jacob D. Rienstra ‘17, Mayer M. Chalom ’17, and Rachel J. Stromberg ’17.
“It was a very rewarding process,” said James M. Graham ’17, who directed Hero. “It’s been a long run deciding what the show’s going to be like… and this was the culmination of all that effort over two semesters, and it’s really paid off.”
On Saturday afternoon, more than 100 free events took place around Harvard Yard at the yearly Performance Fair and Dance Fest in which crowds of spectators gathered around stages and in venues scattered across campus.
A number of music groups, including the Harvard Krokodiloes, performed in front of the John Harvard statue, entertaining students, faculty, and the public alike.
“There was a really nice crowd out enjoying the nice weather and the good performances,” Marek said. “It was a good mix of people from outside the Harvard community and also students and faculty as well.”
Sunday brought a number of less conventional presentations which displayed creative ways in which arts can be merged with other fields. One such event was Symmetry Breaking, an exhibition of Mariel N. Pettee’s ’14 joint Physics and Math thesis which fused performing, visual, and digital arts to explore the nature of scientific inquiry and the creative process.
Overall, students seemed to enjoy the collaborative nature of Arts First. 
“What I like best about the arts community here is that everything is so cooperative,” Graham said. “You don’t just get actors staying actors and musicians staying musicians… Everyone gets along well, goes to see each other’s things, and supports each other.”

In an effort to make the budget of the Undergraduate Council and the individual House Committees more transparent, UC representatives revised their bylaws Sunday in their last general meeting of the semester to strengthen reporting guidelines. Council members also passed legislation to formally support reintroducing American Sign Language into the college’s curriculum and announced that they had discovered $20,000 worth of undeposited checks or funds allocated to them from previous years.
In the first update to its bylaws, the UC mandated that its annual budget, passed at the beginning of the academic year, be sent to members at least 72 hours in advance and contain additional information about the percentage change of expenditures from year to year.
Quincy House representative Brett M. Biebelberg '16 said this measure will allow the UC to be more careful in changing its budget. 
“It’s important that we all have a chance to review the money we are going to be spending,” he said at the meeting.
The second measure requires that House Committees follow similar disclosure methods and reveal their funding sources. Those that neglect to submit budgets by Oct. 1 of each year or relay intentionally inaccurate information will be ineligible for UC funding for at least one year.
While some Council members initially raised concerns about the proposed sanction, UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy '16 said that without a strict deadline and penalty, “there is no point of having that punitive clause to begin with."
Even so, Kanuparthy said that the new measure is not designed to “single out” any HoCo, but is intended to ensure transparency on all fronts.
“It’s really all about making sure that everything is transparent, making sure that we know where our money is going…. We want to know how our money is being used and administrators want to know that as well,” Kanuparthy said after the meeting.
After passing both measures, the UC shifted focus to legislation presented by Committee of Deaf Awareness representatives Erica X Eisen '16, a Crimson Arts Chair, and Julia B. Hyman '15.
Although over 90 percent of students voted in favor of offering ASL courses at the college for credit, because the voter turnout was less than 50 percent, the Council did not officially adopt the stance. On Sunday, however, representatives unanimously agreed to assist the petitioners and connect them with relevant administrators.
Kanuparthy also announced at the meeting that he had discovered $20,000 in uncashed checks or reimbursements spanning seven years.
Kanuparthy said that in analyzing the Council’s budget and bank statements, he learned that previous UC administrations had failed to pick up money as part of a Harvard Student Agencies contract.
Still, Kanuparthy said that passing judgement on former Council members  without knowing the circumstances surrounding their time on the Council would be “extremely premature.”
“This money isn’t about what they failed to do, but it’s about the diligence that we pay down today,” he said after the meeting.
The additional funds will be directed to the formation of a UC endowment, which the Council had announced in late March.
The UC also passed its final grants pack for the year, and allocated up to $1,500 from the Student Initiatives Committee’s budget for an upcoming Quad lawn party.

Discussing organic pesticides, community housing projects, and human rights, representatives from NGOs working in South America and a Harvard professor spoke about the importance of sustainable agricultural practices within small native communities in South America at the Harvard Graduate School of Education Saturday afternoon.
Michael Lorenzo, a student at the Harvard Extension School and the organizer of the event, said that during his time with the Harvard study abroad program in Peru, he noticed that “in Latin America, the biggest buzz word seems to be sustainable, sustainable, sustainable.”  After returning to Harvard, Lorenzo said he organized Saturday’s event in hopes of  “putting into action ideas to make an effective change.”
Charlotte Dougherty, a board member of the NGO Sustainable Harvest International, spoke about her organization’s efforts to alleviate poverty and end deforestation in South America by educating the population about sustainable farming.
Dougherty shared her experiences working with families and farmers in Honduras where she taught them sustainable agriculture techniques. She said when she returned to the village several years later, she was “astounded by their progress, which has made me so passionate about this topic and this organization.”
A representative from FunHabit, an NGO that builds housing projects in rural Ecuador, also spoke about the work of NGOs in promoting the cultivation of indigenous crops grown with organic pesticides.
Finally, Theodore MacDonald, a lecturer in human rights, sustainability, and agriculture development, discussed the importance of sustainable and culturally respectful agriculture.
“Capacity to make progress really exists,” said Macdonald, adding that there needs to be more communication between governments, NGOs, and farmers. Citing recent protests in Peru, MacDonald said that in the future South American farmers need to organize for their interests while still cooperating with the government.
Audience member Jessica Z. Bermudez, a student at the Harvard Extension School, said she enjoyed the event, saying that for her it is “interesting to see the different things organizations are going in different countries to help families, and to see how farmers change their minds about things like pesticides.”

A final spurt of defensive effort made all the difference in the Harvard men’s lacrosse game Friday night. The Crimson (10-5, 5-1 Ivy) battled Yale (9-5, 3-3) for the second time this week, but this time a bid in the Ivy League tournament final was up for grabs. This time around, No. 1-seed Harvard topped the No. 4-seed Bulldogs, 10-9, at Harvard Stadium.
In the fourth period, Harvard forced five turnovers, scooped up eight ground balls, and kept the Yale team to just one goal in the final 15 minutes of play.
“They got some points here and there, but I thought that we came out of that huddle at the end of the third coming into the fourth [and] really locked it down defensively,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Jake [Gambitsky] stepped up, made some big saves, and really inspired our defense to step up and make big plays to really turn the game in our favor.”
Despite the Bulldogs grabbing the lead early in the first and third quarters, the junior goaltender made crucial saves late in the third and throughout the fourth. The goalie also tallied one interception,which put an end to Yale’s three-goal streak.
“Something I’ve continued to try to improve on as a goalie is trying to stay poised,” Gambitsky said. “It’s that next one mentality: you let a goal in, you have to be ready for the next one.”
Gambitsky totaled 10 saves on the night, seven of which came in the second half of play. The game marks his tenth game of the spring with at least ten saves to his name.
“The defense just gave me shots that I could stop towards the end,” Gambitsky said. “What this defensive group is really good at is staying poised and making plays when we need to, and I think a lot of that stems from the chemistry.”
The Crimson defense kept star Bulldog players at bay for most of the night. Yale’s Brandon Mangan had two points with a goal and an assist, while leading scorer Conrad Oberbeck scored three goals in the first half but was silenced for the rest of the match.
“[Oberbeck and Mangan] are great players,” Wojcik said. “We really believe in and really trust our close defense. Tonight, [sophomore] Bobby Duvnjak was primarily responsible for Overbeck and [classmate] Stephen Jahelka for Mangan. We don’t expect to ever shut them down completely. We just want to try to limit what they can do.”
The win marks the Crimson’s fourth game in a row in which one goal separated the victor from the loser.
“We have been trying to extend our season,” co-captain Pete Schwartz said. “And these are the games that are really important. These are must-win games for us.”
The Crimson defeated Yale last week in an 11-10 victory, and clinched a berth to the Ivy League tournament with a victory over Princeton a week prior.
“We have been in some pressure situations in the past couple of weeks,” Gambitsky said.
But Harvard’s offense, like the defense, knew when and how to execute to add to the team’s win count. The Crimson displayed its versatility in the attacking end of the field, with five Harvard players finding the back of the net.
Schwartz shot for three goals and tallied one assist, while sophomores Ian Ardrey Devin Dwyer had another standout game, with Ardrey tying Schwartz with three goals, and Dwyer passing for five assists.
“Devin had an excellent game,” Wojcik said. “He is our quarterback behind our goal, and I think he is as good of a distributor as anyone in the country. He has excellent vision to see the field, see the open lanes, and be able to deliver the pass.”
Dwyer now totals 35 assists, a handful of which have been to Schwartz, who after the night’s game leads the team with 24 goals.
“[Playing with Dwyer] has been awesome for me,” Schwartz said. “I am a guy that likes to shoot the ball, and he is a player that can put it on my stick from 15 or 20 yards [away].”
The Crimson, which remains undefeated at home, will face off against Penn on Sunday for the tournament win. Penn remains the only Ivy competitor to top Harvard this season.
“We love playing at home in front of our home crowd…and it’s been working out for us,” Dwyer said. “Sunday will be another great opportunity for us in front of friends and family, and we are really excited for it.”

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (10-5, 5-1 Ivy) secured a berth in the Ivy League Championship game with a win over rival Yale (9-5, 3-3) in the tournament’s semifinal game Friday night in Harvard Stadium.
This marked the second one-goal win over the Bulldogs in as many weeks for the Crimson. The team’s last four games have all been decided by only one point, three of which resulted in victories for Harvard.
The Crimson defense has now allowed 10 goals or fewer in its last six games, as Harvard and Yale entered the fourth quarter tied 8-8. From there, the Crimson defense effectively shut the Bulldogs down.
With 3:14 remaining in the game, the Yale offense was scrambling, desperately trying to score and keep its season alive. Harvard junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky waited for the right moment, and then, seemingly out of nowhere, sprinted out of the goal to intercept a pass.
After clearing the ball past the mesmerized Bulldog attackmen, the Crimson looked to control possession for the remainder of the game. It seemed like Harvard might walk out with a two-goal victory, until a fan threw a football onto the field.
It was an impressive throw, making it all the way from the crowd into the center of play. It was also a disgraceful and reprehensible act of disrespect by a spectator that nearly cost the Crimson the game.
Harvard was assessed a non-releasable one minute unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, meaning that the team was essentially to play down a man for the remainder of the game, simply for being the home team. Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ‘96 was then given a second penalty for arguing the penalty, putting the Crimson down two men for the rest of the game. 51 seconds is more than enough time to score two goals with a 6-4 manpower advantage.
A series of missed shots and Gambitsky saves ensued, before Yale could finally narrow the lead to one. However, many precious seconds had passed at this point, and the team was down to just 0:08 on the clock, just enough time to score off a quick faceoff win.
Enter senior midfielder and faceoff specialist, Gabriel Mendola. Mendola was called twice earlier in the game for withholding the ball at the bottom of two of the rugby-style scrums that ensued on many of the restarts, but as the senior lined up with both of his wing midfielders in the penalty box, such a delay was exactly what Harvard needed.
Mendola managed to box-out Yale’s Dylan Levings just long enough to prevent the Bulldogs from getting a real shot off, preserving the win for the Crimson and keeping his team’s NCAA tournament hopes alive.
Harvard will face Penn in the championship game Sunday at noon. The last time the two teams met, the Quakers won in Philadelphia inudden death overtime, 8-7.
The winner of Sunday’s championship game will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the Ivy League representative. Win, and you’re in.
 
However, if the Crimson loses on Sunday, things become more complicated.
There are eight at-large bids to the NCAA tournament, given out according to a combination of criteria that includes the RPI computer polls, as well as consideration towards bad losses and victories over top-ranked teams.
 
It is very likely that the Ivy League, one of the top conferences in the country for lacrosse, would have two teams in the field.
Right before the Harvard-Yale game, Penn defeated traditional powerhouse Cornell 11-10. This dropped the Big Red to 11-4 on the season. Cornell will likely be ranked in the top 10 teams according to the computer polls, which would make it a bubble team with a strong candidacy. The Big Red shared the regular season Ivy Leauge title with the Crimson.
Harvard, on the other hand, would likely be ranked between 10 and 15 in the computer polls, mostly due to unfortunate losses to UMASS and Albany early in the season when the team was playing without First-Team All-Ivy League sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer, as well as to Duke and UNC later in the season.
When the two teams met in early April, however, the Crimson dominated Cornell 14-9 with an 8-3 surge in the second half. It is difficult to tell whether the NCAA selection committee would put the Big Red in over the Crimson, considering the result of that game and Harvard’s advancement to the final of the conference tournament, but many people still believe that Cornell is in, regardless of the loss.
The only sure way for the Crimson to make the NCAA tournament is to win on Sunday.

Just seconds out of the gate, the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team accelerated past Northeastern to take an early lead. After finding open water within the first 500 meters, the No. 4 Crimson never looked back en route to its 35th straight victory.
Harvard finished six seconds ahead of the No. 10 Huskies, winning its 17th consecutive Smith Cup in open-water fashion.
“Just mentally, it’s good to know that anyone that we’ve raced we’ve been able to beat,” senior Andrew Reed said. “It gives us confidence that no matter what the competition is, we will be able to put out a really strong effort and be in contention for first and second place.”
After last year’s head-to-head race when both teams smashed the previous Smith Cup record of 5:37.3 set by Harvard in 2000, the Crimson knew not to take the Huskies lightly. In addition, the absence of junior Charlie Risbey, who usually rows in the seventh seat of Harvard’s first varsity boat, forced the team to adjust its lineup and left a question mark about how the race would pan out.
Senior Gregory Edwards stepped up from his spot in the second varsity boat to fill the hole.
“[Edwards] shows the depth of the squad and how strong we are top to bottom,” captain Andrew Holmes said. “Basically anyone can fill that seat, and we can be just as fast.”
This depth has been critical for the Crimson in the first half of its season, as several of the rowers in the 1V8 have been plagued by a variety of injuries and illnesses.
Although other Harvard rowers have filled those absences in the first varsity boat, the Crimson’s lower boats have suffered from the need for substitutions and the reshuffling of rowers. Inconsistent lineups in training and races have made it especially difficult for these boats to gel.
This was evident on Saturday as Northeastern defeated Harvard by nearly twenty seconds in both the third and fourth varsity races.
The second varsity race, however, came down to the final stroke.
After trailing Harvard’s freshman eight for nearly the entire race, the Huskies’ second varsity boat came on strong in the final 500 meters to edge out the Crimson. Harvard’s 1F crossed the finish line at 6:15.7, just 0.4 seconds behind the Huskies and two seconds ahead of the Crimson's 2V8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 3.5 seconds remaining in regulation and down one goal to Penn, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team seemed to be nearing the end of its season. Co-captain Chelsey Newman turned that thought on its head, scoring a goal in the closing seconds of the game and forcing the first game of the Ivy League Tournament into overtime.
But the Crimson (9-7, 4-3 Ivy) could not come up with the victory on Saturday afternoon, ultimately falling to the No. 15 Quakers (12-4, 6-1), 10-9, in double overtime. The team’s first overtime game of the season also proved to be its last.
"It was a really exciting game," Newman said. "It showed a lot about the heart that our team has, and it was so much fun even though the outcome wasn't what we wanted."
The first overtime saw a goal from co-captain Kyleigh Keating put the Crimson up, 9-8. But that would be the last scoring drive from Harvard, as Penn tied the game with 1:22 to go in the first overtime and came through with the winning goal at 2:05 in the second extra frame.
For the day, the Crimson led Penn in most offensive categories, including shots on goal, ground balls, and draw controls. Sophomore attacker Audrey Todd led the team with three goals, recording her sixth hat trick of the season. Todd also added four ground balls and won five draw controls in the loss.
Freshman attacker Marisa Romeo made her presence felt on the field once again after going several games without scoring multiple goals. Romeo had two goals and three assists for Harvard, ending the year with a team-leading point total of 58. She also wrapped up the year with the most goals on the squad, scoring 48 over the course of 16 games.
Harvard came out ready to compete after having dropped its previous Ivy League matchup to Dartmouth on April 25. The offense stayed on pace with the nationally ranked Quakers. Through the nearly 67 minutes of play, there were five ties and five lead changes.
In the opening period of the match, the score was tied at two—and again at three—before the Crimson took a 5-3 advantage, thanks to a goal from sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia that came off a feed from Romeo.
After halftime, Penn came out with two quick goals from Tory Bensen and Nina Corcoran to knot the score at five. The Quaker offense continued to roll, scoring two more goals to take the lead, 7-5, with 17 minutes remaining in regulation.
Late in the second half, the Crimson managed to string together a run of goals from Romeo, freshman attacker Megan Hennessey, and Newman, the last on a pass from Hennessey that closed out the fourth period and forced the game into overtime.
"There were 10 seconds left, and Megan tried to drive to the net but didn't have a lane,” Newman said. “I saw the opening with my defender and ran through the center. I thought ‘why not,’ because we had nothing left to lose. It was really exciting."
Sophomore Kelly Weis was in goal for Harvard for the entire contest. Weis made five saves on the 15 shots taken against her. On the other side of the field, Penn goalkeeper Lucy Ferguson handled seven of the 16 shots that Harvard took through regulation and the two overtime periods.
With the loss and the season now at an end, the Crimson can reflect on its improvement from the 2013 season, when the team finished with a 3-11 record.
"I think it was a lot of hard work and team work and knowing that we wanted to improve a lot this year," Newman said. "We had a clear message for everyone and that was important to keep in mind everyday.”

This week, “Kirkland apples” has become the phrase on every Harvardian produce consumer’s lips. Rumor has it that the apples in Kirkland dining hall are superior to those HUDS stocks everywhere else.
Upon Flyby investigation, the Kirkland apples sit attractively arranged in woven baskets in the Kirkland kitchen area. However, is it the actual apples or the magic of Kirkland d-hall that is causing this phenomenon?  The sampling of apples in Kirkland, according to an anonymous source, looked remarkably alike in quality and type, to the collection that source recalled spotting in Annenberg on many a morning.
 “I wouldn’t know anything about the apples,” Kevin Hong ‘15 said. “I don’t eat them as I am allergic to apples.” Hong seemed admirably stoic for a man whose future is void of apple pie, apple sauce, and Apples to Apples.
“They’re okay,” Jasmine M. Omeke ‘14 offered. She wasn’t eating an apple and apple at the time of questioning.
At last Flyby spoke with a real expert, the “Apple Queen of Kirkland”: Lily H. Ostrer ‘14. Ostrer’s love of apples is so great, in fact, that she gave them up for Lent. It is rumored that she eats more Kirkland apples than the rest of Kirkland aggregated. Lily graciously shared her expertise with Flyby.
Flyby: So you gave apples up for Lent?
LHO: Yeah.
Flyby: So you must love apples then.
LHO: Yeah, I really love apples. For most people, apples aren’t a vice, but for  me,  they are. I eat like 10 apples a day.
Flyby: How do you feel about the quality of Kirkland’s apples?
LHO: I think in general Kirkland has pretty great apples. This year in particular,  we’ve had some very good apples. Sometimes, they’re not quite as fresh as  they  appear, so when you bite into them, they might be a bit mealy. In general,  though, we have really great apples. This year we started having Gala apples,  which we haven’t had in previous years, and I particularly enjoy the Galas.  There’s usually a good variety of a few different types of apples [here in  Kirkland].
Flyby: If you could choose any variety of apple, that isn’t already in Kirkland, to add  to the apple options, which would you choose?
LHO: I really like the Gala. I think we could have some more Macintosh, and also  some Golden Delicious. [pauses thoughtfully] I’m really glad that we don’t have Red  Delicious apples in Kirkland House, as I know some houses do, because they really  aren’t as high a quality apple as the others.
Aaron J. Henricks ‘16 vehemently disagreed with Ostrer about about the alleged superiority of Kirkland’s apples. “I feel that’s totally false,” Henricks said. “I ate one of the best apples I’ve eaten in my lifetime in Quincy the other day, and it was so sweet, so juicy...that people in Dunster actually heard me eating it.” It seems that opinions vary greatly regarding the validity of this recent fruit fanaticism. And, by the way, have you heard about the oranges at Cabot?
