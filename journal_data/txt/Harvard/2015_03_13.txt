After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two columns ago, I admonished the Supreme Court for delaying unnecessarily in its gay marriage jurisprudence, and pointed to the confusion in Alabama as evidence for why quick action would have been better. The situation in Alabama has actually worsened since then, with the state Supreme Court now claiming that it need not follow the rulings of lower federal courts. This impasse will undoubtedly be resolved quickly, as soon as the Supreme Court rules on gay marriage in the summer. In the meantime, however, the Alabama Court’s actions serve as a disturbing reminder that the robust federal government we take for granted today has never been a guaranteed feature of the American political landscape.
In a recent article in Vox, Matthew Yglesias argued provocatively that “American democracy is doomed” because the ever-growing tension between the executive and legislative branches is too extreme for any system to handle ad infinitum. Yglesias claims that problems arise when both the President and Congress can plausibly argue that they are the true repositories of the people’s will.
This particular prediction about the demise of American constitutionalism may or may not prove prescient. What is true, however, is that power has long been vested in two distinct and competing bodies in the American federal system: The federal government and the states.
In theory, the relative power of each is pretty clear. According to Article VI of the Constitution,  “the Laws of the United States…shall be the supreme law of the land.” In practice things have not been so simple. Federal supremacy competed with the idea that the Constitution created a national government of limited, enumerated, powers.  In the 1830s, during the nullification crisis, South Carolina drove the country to the brink of war by arguing that it could declare federal law unconstitutional, and it was able to secure lower tariffs in the process.
Less than thirty years later, the nation was not so lucky, and fought its deadliest conflict because the slave states wanted to be left alone. Ironically, before the Civil War, the federal government had not exactly been a fount of truth and justice. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Fugitive Slave Act, and most infamously the Dred Scott decision all saw federal power used on behalf of slavery. The war began to change this dynamic. Congressional actions like the Enlistment Act, freeing the slaves who fought with the Union and their family members, morphed into the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, all of which set the precedent for the federal government to act as a decisive guarantor of national concerns and equal rights against sectional interests.
That evolution did not happen overnight. From the late 19th century until the 1930s, the Supreme Court continually thwarted the federal government from enacting laws against discrimination and laws regulating the economy because these efforts supposedly exceeded federal power. In time, however, the Court acquiesced to the exercise of federal power over these areas, and the right to supersede state authority. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, "The Notorious R.B.G.," wrote in her opinion in National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius, the “line-drawing exercises” the Court attempted earlier in its history—trying, for example, to distinguish between “direct” and “indirect” effects on interstate commerce—were “untenable.”
Unfortunately, these sensible lessons still elude us in some spheres. School desegregation provides a good example of what happens when the federal government finds its power bizarrely curtailed. In the 1974 case Milliken v. Bradley, the Supreme Court essentially ruled that a desegregation order could apply only to individual school districts. While not specifically an issue of states’ rights, this ruling shows that an unnecessary and unwarranted deference to local and state concerns, even when obstructing what Justice Thurgood Marshall termed “fundamental” rights, persists. With a stroke of the pen, the Supreme Court took the power out of their Brown v. Board of Education decision by severely curtailing federal enforcement.
Why do the Court’s more recent “line-drawing exercises” tend to fail just like its earlier ones? Because the issues concern national matters, for both practical and moral reasons. Regulating agricultural production, for example, in a globalized, industrial, heavily interconnected economy, cannot be accomplished piecemeal, state-by-state. Ditto for health insurance.
Furthermore, if the moral foundation of the United States is the idea that all people are “created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,” it makes no sense to let regimes of discrimination continue to thrive anywhere within its borders.
This moral imperative is what makes the situation in Alabama particularly disturbing. When the extent of the federal government’s writ encounters artificial and nonsensical limits, it generally spells trouble for minorities, for working people, for sensible economic regulation and, above all, for national laws and constitutional principles which reflect the best of our shared values. The Alabama Supreme Court is currently engaged in a challenge to all of these benefits of robust national government. It should not be allowed to succeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, one of my politically active friends revealed to me that he was growing discouraged from engaging in substantive political discourse on campus, citing the criticism and contempt he often faced upon voicing his opinion. He, like myself, and many other conservatives on campus, had begun to feel as though his ideology was no longer valid, a remnant of a time gone by. He felt, for lack of a better term, silenced.
Harvard loves to tout its statistics on diversity, and for good reason: From race to class to gender to orientation, the oldest university in the nation is also among the most inclusive. But when it comes to political heterogeneity, the numbers speak for themselves. A Crimson survey put the percentage of conservatives in the class of 2018 at 15.7 percent, and the class of 2017 is not far behind at 15 percent. While these numbers most likely stem from a self-selection rather than an admissions bias, editorial attempts at satire like Warning: Do Not Enroll certainly don’t attempt to alleviate this culture of exclusivity.
I didn’t heed their advice, however, and enrolled at Harvard as an uninformed, apathetic conservative, who throughout high school was far more concerned with getting into a school like this than I was with developing a political ideology. My parents had always been right-leaning, due in part to their operation of a small family business, so I suppose I inherited many of my political tenets from them. As a result, I rarely if ever thought critically about the positions I held. But that quickly changed here in Cambridge.
Arriving a week early for the Freshman Urban Program in the autumn of 2013, I nervously bid farewell to my taxi and was bombarded by a group of purple-clad upperclassmen flaunting signs daring passers-by to “Honk If You Hate Reagan!” I spent the week burying even my very moderate convictions deep below the surface, hoping ideology would trend towards the center as more students arrived on campus.
Oftentimes friends from home will question how I withstand the pressure, incessantly encountering liberal undertones and sometimes, even a complete disregard for my core beliefs. I’ll admit, upon arrival it was very hard. Hard to hear my professors use the term “Republican” in a derogatory manner. Hard to face ridicule when enthusiastically describing an encounter with Senator John S. McCain last spring. Hard to be asked to defend some obscure representative’s comments that I found equally outrageous. So eventually I just stopped talking about it.
But the more time I spend on campus, the more content I am to find myself in the ideological minority. My experience at Harvard has prevented me from constructing the echo chamber so many people in both parties fall into, only reading and discussing sources that reinforce their own beliefs. There simply aren’t enough conservatives here for that to prove a sustainable social model. Rather, continuously fending off attacks on my beliefs has strengthened those I hold true, and forced me to discard inaccurate doctrine. Some of the most meaningful discussions I have had were initiated by one of my liberal roommates questioning one of my principles. Occasionally we would arrive at an impasse, but the vast majority of the time the frequency with which we agreed was a pleasant surprise.
I realize full well that my relative discomfort is trivial compared to the struggles many others face on campus, and that a few communities are becoming increasingly open to challenging conversations. But for Harvard to truly embrace its mission of “respecting ideas and their free expression,” students and faculty alike must acknowledge that the culture on campus is not currently reflective of the ideals claiming to be espoused. Liberals who dismissively reject conservatism at first glance are themselves embracing the very dogma of close-mindedness they tend to associate with the GOP. Harvard allows Democrats the opportunity of four years to imagine they comprise 85 percent of the nation, but a harsh reality awaits following graduation. If we as a nation ever hope to break through the gridlock that is holding Washington hostage, institutions of higher learning must cultivate a new generation of leaders who are willing to reach across the aisle and restore our democracy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several weeks ago, the University of California, Los Angeles student council first rejected, and then subsequently confirmed, the nomination of sophomore Rachel Beyda for a position on the student government’s judicial board. The original refusal centered on questions about her Jewish faith, with some student council members charging that it might bias her judgement. Only after a faculty member intervened to request the council set aside issues of religion did Ms. Beyda receive approval to join the board. We find it hard to draw any conclusion except that the student council voted against Ms. Beyda solely because of opposition to her religious beliefs. We condemn this and any other forms of religious discrimination wholeheartedly.
During the meeting, some council members expressed concern about Ms. Beyda’s Jewish faith and involvement with Jewish organizations on campus. In their view, such activities represented a potential conflict of interest with any potential Israel-related issues. Even if one previous case had involved a trip to Israel, as was noted during the meeting, automatically assuming that Ms. Beyda’s religious affiliation impaired her ability to think clearly and fairly smacks of anti-Semitism.
Having perspectives, opinions, and thoughtful ideas is not dangerous—in fact, it should be considered beneficial. We all have worldviews that shape us: Our life experiences, racial background, sexual orientation, family upbringing, cultural values, and political views all influence how one might vote on the UCLA judicial board.
In fact, many who participate in student government are also involved in other extracurriculars, yet were not placed under the same harsh scrutiny as Ms. Beyda. Involvement in groups that are defined by political affiliation, sexual orientation, or even racial identity are rarely, if ever, considered sources of potential conflicts of interest for members of student government. To single out ethnic and religious views as problematic is not only dangerous but also racially and religiously discriminatory.
Moreover, even if there had been a legitimate concern that her involvement in Jewish campus organizations would pose a conflict of interest in certain judicial board cases, this should not have prevented her from being approved for a role on that board. There would be precedent for such situations: Proper procedure would be for her to remedy this actual conflict of interest by recusing herself, not for the council to reject her wholesale as a candidate. The board would thus still able to enjoy the benefits of her judgment in the vast majority of cases—as the student body at UCLA will now fortunately be able to do. Again, though, Ms. Beyda's place in religious groups should not require such procedures.
Had the vote not been reversed, this incident would not only have deprived UCLA of a juror that all agree was highly qualified but also have set a dangerous precedent. This incident is yet another reminder that the irrelevancy of a candidate's racial or ethnic background, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, family background, and socioeconomic status must be reaffirmed. These differences should not be a tool for separation or discrimination—we are enriched and educated through exposure to diverse worldviews. We must cherish that belief and never waver in our resolve to eliminate discrimination on any basis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t like secrets. Nor do I have many of them. My bed is located in the common room. I have had sex within the pages of The Crimson. I don’t see the point in closing bathroom doors, unless I am in the bathtub painting my nails, and that’s because a glossy topcoat is an art that requires total concentration. My roommates literally had to teach me when to knock on their doors.
There are good reasons to keep secrets. If being out about your gender identity means losing your parents’ support, not talking can be an important choice. If you’re judging a peer’s poetry submission in a small community, it's best not to know who the author is. And if you’re running a competitive comp, or semester-long audition for an organization, keeping your assessment of compers’ abilities from other candidates is an act of kindness.
But sometimes here at Harvard we suffer from Secret Room Syndrome.
Harvard people like accomplishing shit. There’s always a secret room to discover, a new level to reach, something unfathomably wonderful around the next bend. This impulse is awesome when it comes to cancer research or performance art. And for people who are marginalized, building our own secret spaces is empowering. But often at Harvard, secret rooms are spaces where privilege concentrates.
If you’re in a social club, or if you’ve ever tried to talk to someone about their social club, you may have run up against the door to a secret room: “We keep that within the club.”
The same happens with comps. Maybe there are parts of an organization’s building that non-members can’t go to. Maybe some initiation rituals are kept hush-hush. Maybe requirements are mysterious, or we’re not told how we’re being judged.
Secrets are sexy. Secrets play directly into our desire to belong. Shared secrets bond communities, and wanting to be in on a community’s secret makes us work harder to join. But secrets often reinforce patterns of exclusivity. They can prevent us from being accountable to communities beyond our spheres.
A lot of people at Harvard don’t come from privilege, and a lot of people do cool things to overturn systems of privilege. But Harvard is a place that makes elites. And it’s a place with a lot of internal stratification.
Secret-keeping reinforces this stratification. It creates ingroups and outgroups. For a lot of us, entering the ingroup seems to require a password we don’t know. This password might be a class norm or a kind of behavior that is gendered and raced. When we use secrecy to cultivate mystique—when we refuse to talk about our clubs, or stay conspicuously mum about what we do—we not only reinforce the difference between ingroup and outgroup. We also create hierarchies of belonging. These hierarchies play on inequalities in the larger world.
Secrecy also prevents us from being accountable. When no one’s looking, I eat the chocolate-covered macadamia nuts straight from the Whole Foods bin. And I bet that dude wouldn’t have street harassed me last night had his friends not also catcalled. People do things in groups, and in private, that they wouldn’t otherwise do.
Consider the racist bullshit that just went down at the University of Oklahoma. If the SAE dudes were standing in front of the whole university, rather than just in their fraternity, how many of them would have said what they said? We’re all responsible for our choices. But closed communities of privilege don’t help.
Or what about the recent kerfluffle over the Spee’s objectifying party invitations? A club representative issued a public apology directly to The Crimson—a great example of taking accountability. But if clubs were more open to scrutiny to begin with—if members’ attitudes toward gender inclusion were transparent, if alumni board membership were public, and if club officers were more willing to talk to the press—perhaps the incident wouldn’t have taken place. Openness keeps us responsible to each other, to our communities, and to ourselves.
Secret rooms can give us lots of things: Job networks; spaces to get our groove on; feelings of prestige. Especially for those of us not born into secret rooms—maybe not even born in houses—learning the password can change our world.
But we shouldn’t hide success behind a password at all.
At the end of the day, it’s a simple question about what kind of community we want to be. Are we going to trust that what we have to offer—our clubs, our magazines, our teams, ourselves—is good enough, cool enough, interesting enough to draw people in without an added level of mind-fuck?
Are we going to deal with our problems in the open like the deep thinkers, empathic listeners, slightly sloppy kissers, and resolute p-set buddies we are?
Or are we going to cross our legs like dudes taking up too much space on the subway, cackle softly like cartoon capitalists, and plot amongst ourselves?
I used to have Secret Room Syndrome. I jumped through the hoops, I guessed at the passwords, I flirted with the sentinels, I followed Tadzio around the bends. And when I got there, I found—well, not much. The furniture was decrepit. The music was so-so. There was no ice cream. But mostly, I found the people who were there with me.
I’m not gonna lie: The booze was excellent. But frankly, I’m more interested in exploring the brilliant rooms of my friends.

The dining halls in Currier House and Dunster House’s temporary space in the former Inn at Harvard will remain open through spring break as part of a new pilot program funded by the Office of the Dean of the College.
After other dining halls close following dinner service on Friday, Currier and Dunster will remain open through spring break for lunch and dinner, but not breakfast.
The initiative follows several lobbying attempts by the Undergraduate Council, including legislation passed in spring 2013 requesting that the College provide on-campus dining over spring break.
Because students were not required to register in order to stay on campus for spring break, there is no exact number of how many undergraduates will remain, according to Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper '94. Administrators will use meal swipe data throughout the week to help determine how many students are on campus, he added.
Cooper also wrote that Currier and Dunster dining halls will provide lunch and dinner service, as well as weekend brunch, at “regular meal times.”—Staff writer Kamara A. Swaby can be reached at kamara.swaby@thecrimson.com. Follow her on Twitter @SwabyK.

Harvard College is one step closer to implementing its first-ever honor code after publishing Thursday the names of 26 undergraduates who will serve in official roles created as part of the College’s revised procedures for adjudicating alleged violations of academic integrity.
Twelve undergraduates will sit on the Honor Council, which will hear cases of alleged academic integrity violations, and 14 will serve as “academic integrity fellows” and will provide advising to students accused of breaching the honor code. The 26 students were named to their positions for the 2015-2016 academic year.
Of the 12 undergraduates on the Honor Council, seven are currently sophomores, three are freshmen, and two are juniors. Two students—Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16 and  Nathaniel Bernstein ’17—are also members of the Academic Integrity Committee, which drafted the honor code.
In the coming months, the Honor Council will meet weekly to receive training from faculty and study mock cases as members prepare to adjudicate cases next semester, Interim Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger said in late January.
Meg G. Panetta ’17, a member of the Honor Council, said that she had received a syllabus detailing the training and that students on the Council convened in an introductory meeting on Monday.
The Council will also comprise 12 faculty, staff, and graduate student members whom Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will select. Khurana wrote in an email that he is “excited about the progress that the Honor Council is making” and is still finalizing appointments of those 12 non-undergraduate members.
Flehinger wrote in an emailed statement that he was grateful for the student membership of the Council and believes that the Honor Council “will shape the academic culture here at Harvard for years to come.”
Undergraduates on the Council likewise praised the honor code and the function they say it will play in promoting a culture of academic integrity.
“I think we can do something to contribute to academic integrity here and I'm looking forward to doing that,” Panetta said.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is expected to vote on the affirmation of integrity statement—a key component of the honor code—in April. In a meeting earlier this month, Faculty heard the current proposal of the statement, which would require that students affirm their awareness of the honor code before each semester, during final exams, and on final papers and projects.

Upperclassmen descended upon the Yard Thursday morning to display their House spirit and deliver House assignments to freshmen.
Paying the brisk windy weather—which some still considered an improvement from snowy weather last year—no heed, upperclassmen stood chanting in the Yard, sporting face paint and colorful House swag like Dunster House antlers and Adams House boxers, before rushing off to freshman dorms with House assignments in hand.
Behind suite doors, freshmen waited anxiously to receive their Housing letters.
Outside Annenberg after receiving their assignment, Julie A. Baldassano ’18 and her blockmates recounted their moments of suspense.
“We had Cabot knock on our door at least three times, to fake us out,” Baldassano said, remembering the waves of upperclassmen who came and went. “My heart was breaking.”
In the end, upperclassmen from Mather House rushed into their suite, to both “silent” and “super happy” reactions from her blockmates, Baldassano said.
But Baldassano and her friends, donning coordinated Harvard sweaters and Mather headbands, said they had a fun time on Housing Day, even though several had midterms later Thursday.
The carnival atmosphere continued throughout the day. During lunchtime, House representatives welcomed their new members inside Annenberg by distributing House shirts and other House merchandise.
Outside Annenberg, members of Lowell House Committee invited freshmen to make s’mores on their portable fire pits. Nearby, Leverett House organized a rabbit petting zoo, in honor of their House mascot. A Currier House resident stood by the entrance waving his arms and wearing an inflatable tree costume, representing Currier’s mascot.
Joanna M. Guth ’16 and Nick J. Stager ’16, members of Kirkland HoCo who helped distribute House assignments to freshmen, said they enjoyed the opportunity to welcome new students and show off their House pride. Stager had donned a boar costume—the Kirkland House mascot—for the occasion, while Guth carried a sign inscribed with the words “Twerkland Kirkland.”
Guth said that some Kirkland students had been at the John Harvard statue since 5 o’clock that morning, in order to “claim” the statue by draping the Kirkland flag over it.
“If you look at all the photos today, the Kirkland flag is on John Harvard. We take pride in getting there first,” Guth said.
Kirkland was one of the many houses that continued Housing Day festivities throughout the evening. Houses invited freshmen to dinner and other social activities in the House.
“It’s fun just to see the big crowds of people running around,” Stager said. “Housing Day is really one day of the year where [House spirit] really comes out. A lot of people get involved that don’t normally get involved in House life.”

The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers has begun electing representatives and holding strategy meetings for contract negotiations scheduled to begin with University administrators in late March.
While the union is still in the process of developing the specifics of negotiations, HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said the the union is likely to bring in public health or policy experts from the University to serve as advisors during the negotiations.
“Neutral, academic subject matter expertise or advice, especially in the healthcare area, could be really important,” Jaeger said. “I think some of our health care negotiations in recent years haven’t gone particularly well. Maybe we need to find a third way or fourth way.”
Jaeger said HUCTW and the University observe an informal agreement not to bring in outside legal counsel during negotiations.
In addition to facilitating the election of representatives for negotiations, HUCTW leaders also held the first of more than 60 planned strategy meetings last Tuesday to discuss goals for the upcoming negotiations.
“In these meetings, we have been discussing the fact that we are facing challenges and how we might approach those from a different direction to make things go better for everybody,” said Carrie E. Barbash, a union organizer  for HUCTW.
Barbash said the meetings are particularly targeted at union members who have not experienced a labor negotiation before. Roughly 1,500 members of the nearly 5,000-member union are new to the negotiation process, according to Jaeger.
Another goal of the meetings, Jaeger said, is to explain the background of negotiation conflicts in the recent past.
“I think it is broadly understood that we had a troubled set of talks in 2012-2013,” Jaeger said. “When you look at the history of this relationship, in the long arc of it, the Union and the University have done a lot of innovative and progressive things together in terms of Harvard and the workplace.”
In a newsletter to Harvard leadership sent Friday morning, University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp emphasized the University’s desire for productivity in the upcoming negotiations.
“We begin this conversation committed to ensuring good wages and benefits that protect our employees, respect their service, provide opportunities for growth and advancement, and acknowledge the financial realities they and the university face today and into the future,” Lapp wrote in the newsletter.

A clogged manhole in Waltham released approximately 900 gallons per hour of raw sewage Tuesday, some of which flowed into the Hobbs Brook Reservoir, a source of drinking water for the Cambridge community. City and state officials, however, emphasized that the leak does not pose a threat to public health.
Due to the size of the reservoir and the fact that the water goes through several stages of treatment, officials said, the leakage is of little concern.
“It is in the nature of any outdoor body of surface water that there are plenty of bacteria,” said Sam Lipson of the Cambridge Public Health Department. “There are plenty of animals that use those ponds, and there are humans as well.”
“This does not constitute even an event of minor concern for us,” he added.
Cambridge city officials were notified Tuesday morning by the city of Waltham that a blockage located about 400 feet from the reservoir caused backed up sewage to overflow and run into the reservoir. Despite initial difficulties locating the source of the leak due to the heavy snowfall recently experienced in the region, city workers removed the blockage by Tuesday afternoon, Cambridge City Manager Richard C. Rossi said.
According to the Cambridge Water Department, the maximum capacity of freshwater held in the Hobbs Brook Reservoir is 2.5 billion gallons. Both  Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Edmund J. Coletta and Rossi emphasized that due to the size of the reservoir, citizens should not be concerned about the safety of the drinking water.
“We felt that the dilution factor was such that [the sewage] would not present any harm to the general public,” Rossi said.
Both officials added that in addition to the size of the Hobbs Brook Reservoir, the sewage would be further diluted and removed from the system by passing through other reservoirs and undergoing a treatment process.
Rossi emphasized that this mixing of different water sources as well as the treatment process mitigated any cause for health concerns.
The city evaluates the city’s water quality on a weekly basis, according to Lipson.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office will open in its new space on the fourth floor of the Smith Campus Center on Tuesday, March 17.
“We’re going to continue to offer all the same services...but what’s great is that well be closer to where students are during the day,” FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said.
According to Burke, being closer to the Houses and dorms as well as to other FAS and graduate school offices will enable students to take care of different errands “all in one building.”
The space itself will be “very different” from the current 20 Garden Street location, Burke said. “It’s one consistent theme as soon as you walk off the elevators,” he said.
The current office will be closed Friday and Monday in preparation for the move.

While seniors in many departments have turned in their theses in the past week, students pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in the Engineering Sciences are still hard at work on their hands-on, project-based theses, which are not due until the week after spring break.
With oral presentations scheduled for March 26 and 27 and written reports due on April 2, the upcoming week-long holiday will be crunch time for seniors to finish their projects.
For the over 40 seniors enrolled in the Engineering Sciences senior thesis class, ES100hf: Engineering Design Projects, a thesis means spending hours literally getting their hands dirty in labs and workshops designing, building, and testing physical products to solve real-world problems.
According to Woodward Yang, one of the instructors of ES100hf, some concentrators found themselves unprepared for the level of commitment required by the project.
He said around five to 10 percent of the class dropped their projects and switched to the Bachelor of Arts degree, which does not require a thesis.
“It’s one thing to be able to do a problem set; this is not like that. Some of them realize that it takes a huge amount of discipline…. You’ve got to pace yourself,” he said.
Since the hands-on nature of the projects makes it difficult to work when seniors are off campus, many will spend their spring break here working on their theses.
Johnathan M. Budd ’15, who is building a vehicle that tracks objects underwater, said he will spend four days working on his project over the holiday.
“It’s nice to have time to work on it, but it is really sad that everyone else is already done and enjoying their senior spring and you still have to spend a lot of time working on your thesis,” he said.
Even though the looming deadlines make it difficult to relax over the holiday, students say the extra time is necessary.
“Obviously there is an element of jealousy, but really I need the time,” said Robert A. Flitsch ’15, who is building a mobile 3D printing robot that uses water to print ice.
Ansel B. Duff ’15 said he will not be spending much time working on his project during the break because he will be off-campus. However, he said he is not representative of the rest of the engineering class.
“A lot of people will be here on campus working quite diligently over the break,” said Duff, who built a go-kart powered by compressed air.
Tyler R. Kugler ’15 said he will not work on his thesis at all over the next week. He plans to finish things up after break during the last four days before the deadline.
He added, however, that he has spent all his free time this semester on his project. “I think it’s the case for a lot of engineering students as it gets down to the wire,” he said.
According to Kugler, the biggest challenge for seniors is striking a balance between enjoying the last year of college and pacing their thesis work.
“There’s never a great time for your thesis to be due,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anticipating Boston hotels’ concerns about potential liability risks associated with hosting the College’s annual freshman formal, organizers have opted to hold the event on campus, outside on the Science Center Plaza, in late April this year.
The move will mark the first time that Harvard has hosted freshman formal on campus since at least 2007, according to Katherine W. Steele, the College’s director for freshman programming who oversees the event alongside the First-Year Social Committee. In the past, the College has hosted the event at hotels throughout Boston.
Steele said organizers began considering holding the event on campus after anticipating that it might be difficult to find a space large enough to accommodate 1,200 students. In addition, Steele said hotels in the area have expressed reservations in response to alcohol-related incidents not restricted to Harvard-sponsored events.
Last year’s freshman formal, which took place at the Seaport Boston Hotel, ended one hour early after hotel staff raised concerns about intoxicated students in attendance.
This year, Steele said, she and other organizers “didn’t even try” to arrange the event at a hotel, partly because they anticipated that it would be difficult to negotiate an arrangement especially with the few venues that were large enough to host the dance. While Steele said she does not fault the hotels for having concerns about liability risks, she said hosting the event off campus created a unique feel.
“It makes the whole experience of a formal different, so it’s too bad that it’s hard to make that happen now because of all these factors,” Steele said.
Still, Steele said hosting the formal on the Science Center Plaza will save costs. Renting the tent for the formal will cost $2,500, which is “far, far less” than the total cost of renting a hotel venue, Steele said. The College will also not need to pay for transportation back to Cambridge at the close of the dance.
Organizers pushed the date from mid-February to April 29 because the tent in the plaza will not open until around that time and they anticipate that the weather will be more favorable later in the spring.
While undergraduates will still purchase tickets for the dance, the First-Year Social Committee hopes to offer reduced ticket prices this year, according to Wyatt M. Robertson ’18, a co-chair of the formal. Those prices will depend on the budget for the dance, which the committee has not yet finalized, Robertson added.
Steele and Robertson said organizers also have more power to arrange catering, decorations, and other planning specific to this year’s James Bond theme because the event is on campus.
“It does put more of a burden on us, but we like it, and so we have to do a lot more of the planning this year, but overall, we’re saving the students a lot more money,” Robertson said.
Gretty Garcia ’18, also a c0-chair of the formal, said she hopes the dance will attract more freshmen because of the Science Center Plaza’s proximity to Harvard Yard.

Paul Andrew, the current acting vice president of Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, the University’s public relations and lobbying apparatus, will take over leadership of HPAC on a permanent basis according to an announcement from President Drew G. Faust on Thursday.
Andrew replaces Christine Heenan, who announced her departure from HPAC in October and took a job at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
“I’m really honored by the opportunity [to serve] a really remarkable institution and to work with faculty, students, staff to fulfill the mission of the University,” Andrew said.  “Harvard does incredible things and our faculty is doing amazing things, and we want to make sure the world understands that.”
Andrew, who has been with HPAC since 2012, will assume the top position there during the middle of a multi-year fundraising campaign that Faust launched in September 2013. Harvard has raised at least $5 billion in gifts and pledges that will go toward its $6.5 billion goal. Andrew will now also oversee Harvard’s government and community relations strategy.
“Paul has done an outstanding job since coming to Harvard, and I’m very pleased to have him lead our public affairs and communications efforts,” Faust said in a press release. “He thinks creatively and strategically, he knows Harvard, he cares deeply about higher education, and he has a thoughtful, collaborative style that colleagues value and admire.”
Charged with overseeing the University’s communications in public, government, and community affairs in his new role, Andrew said he hopes to continue Heenan’s work, crediting his predecessor with doing “a remarkable job at HPAC” and building “a very strong organization.”

Alan M. Dershowitz, Harvard Law School professor emeritus, has made another filing in a Florida federal district court case as the prominent attorney seeks legal standing to disprove allegations of sexual misconduct in court.
Late last year, Dershowitz was accused of having had sexual relations with then-underage “Jane Doe No. 3,” in a civil court case challenging a plea deal for Jeffrey E. Epstein, a billionaire and Harvard donor who went to state prison for soliciting prostitution. Dershowitz served on the legal team that negotiated Epstein’s plea deal, helping him to avoid federal prosecution. In the filing, “Jane Doe No. 3” claimed that Epstein had forced her to have sex with Dershowitz in a variety of locations, including Epstein’s homes in Florida, the U.S Virgins Islands, and on Epstein’s private plane.
The allegations have sparked a back-and-forth legal battle, and Dershowitz has since responded to the claims both publicly and legally.
Dershowitz's most recent legal response to the claims focuses on the chronology of “Jane Doe No. 3’s” accusations. In particular, the filing argues that had Dershowitz’s name come up as a suspect during the initial negotiations for the plea deal, “Professor Dershowitz would have been immediately recused from negotiations, and he would have been investigated.”

Over two hundred attendees filled the Geological Lecture Hall at the Harvard Museum of Natural History Thursday evening to hear Professor Stanley H. Ambrose of  the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign illustrate the path of human evolution following a catastrophic volcanic eruption.
Ambrose was invited to speak by Christian A. Tryon, a Harvard professor of Anthropology. Tryon said Ambrose’s research is not only inspiring but also “hits all the buttons for the Harvard museums by bringing together anthropology, ecology, [and] environment.”
Prior to discussing its impact on humanity, Ambrose emphasized the magnitude of the eruption in question. When Mount Toba erupted approximately 74,000 years ago in what is now northern Sumatra, its ashes traveled to a distance equivalent to the width of the United States and covered more than 21 million square kilometers in a foot of ash, Ambrose said. The reflection of sunlight by the ashes triggered a six-year long volcanic winter that decimated life on Earth, including ancestral humans who lived in Africa.
Ambrose’s lecture focused on the competition for survival between humans and Neanderthals following the eruption of Mount Toba. He described Neanderthals as a violent and cannibalistic species that engaged in strenuous activities during the day.
After Toba, humans adapted to form cooperative social networks whereas Neanderthals failed to change, Ambrose said.
“With two people, or three people cooperating, they can feed the whole camp,” Ambrose said. “There’s no negative in reciprocity.”
Abandoning the “your gain is my loss” attitude unlike Neanderthals allowed humans to exchange information and explore unknown territories, eventually leading them to expand out of Africa to give rise to modern humans, he said.
Ambrose hypothesized that Neanderthals may have had a genetic predisposition for aggressive and uncooperative behavior that human ancestors lacked.
According to Jane Pickering, executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, Ambrose’s lecture was one of many offered to the public by the various museums at Harvard.

Kimberly Theidon, a former Harvard associate anthropology professor, filed a lawsuit against the University Thursday in federal court, reiterating allegations that Harvard denied her tenure in May 2013 for advocating for victims of sexual assault.
The complaint—which names Harvard and the Harvard Corporation as defendants—reiterates several allegations that Theidon previously made in a complaint she filed roughly a year ago with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging that Harvard’s decision to deny her tenure violated the federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. She later withdrew that complaint and indicated her plans to sue the University.
Prior to filing the initial charge, Theidon had appealed Harvard’s decision to deny her tenure.
Theidon’s Thursday complaint alleges that Harvard “retaliat[ed] against her by denying her tenure immediately after and because...she supported” a student campaign to reexamine the school’s response to complaints of sexual assault.
Additionally, Theidon alleges in the complaint that she was denied tenure because she opposed what she viewed as a “sexually hostile environment” for women who complained about sexual assault and harassment at Harvard. Finally, the 34-page complaint alleges that the University denied Theidon tenure because of her gender.
The complaint says this “retaliation” violated Title IX and anti-employment discrimination law Title VII.
In the complaint, Theidon specifies a number of concerns regarding how her gender allegedly affected her ultimate tenure decision. She claims that she was held to a higher standard than male peers and received “less pay and work space than those accorded to males who had less experience or productivity.” Theidon also alleges that Judith D. Singer, senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity, was aware of “one or more of Theidon’s gender based concerns.”
In particular the complain hlighted Theidon's response to a March 2013 Crimson article about sexual assault at Harvard, according to the complaint. In her comments on the story, Theidon offered a defense of the anonymous sexual assault victims quoted in the story.
Neither Theidon nor Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga could be reached for comment late Thursday night.
Harvard employed Theidon until June 2014, when her contract expired and her formal relationship with the University ended. When still at Harvard, she held the title of  John L. Loeb associate professor of the social sciences, an endowed position. Theidon’s complaint says that, prior to being denied tenure, she had received indication that she was in a good position to receive promotion.
Theidon joined Harvard’s faculty in 2004 and became an associate professor in 2008.

UPDATED: March 13, 2015, at 2:02 a.m.
A week after visiting Selma, Ala., in honor of the 50th Anniversary of the Voting Rights March, University President Drew G. Faust is set to appear in China on Sunday to “shar[e] her vision for the future” of Harvard with alumni in Beijing.
"President Faust looks forward to joining nearly 450 alumni, friends and faculty in Beijing this weekend to celebrate Harvard's many connections to China at the latest event in the Your Harvard series," Jeff Neal, Faust's spokesperson, wrote in a statement early Friday. "Early next week, she also will give an address to students and faculty at Tshinghua University."
Faust's visit to Beijing is the next installment in a series of talks held in cities around the world called “Your Harvard.” Last May, Faust traveled to New York to update about 600 University supporters on the progress of Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, which has a public goal of $6.5 billion and so far has reached at least $5 billion in gifts and pledges.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team (21-7, 11-3 Ivy) needing some magic to happen in Hanover, N.H. on Saturday night, Lady Luck shined again.
In many of the most critical victories during the Crimson’s run of five consecutive Ancient Eight championships, Harvard was not a participant. Three years ago, a loss by Penn in the season’s final game averted a playoff only one year after Princeton’s Douglas Davis tore out Harvard’s heart with a game-winner in the 2011 tiebreaker. In 2013, Harvard went into the final weekend down a game in the loss column to the Tigers before stunning black-and-orange collapses in New Haven and Providence gave the Crimson the title.
Saturday night, when Dartmouth overcame a five-point deficit with 35 seconds to go, Harvard once again grasped victory from the jaws of defeat. The Crimson’s reward for clinching its fifth consecutive conference championship is a rubber match with the Bulldogs (22-9, 11-3) Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia.
“In these games, you just need to focus on the task at hand,” senior wing Wesley Saunders said. “Everybody is excited, everyone is...hyping everything up, and it’s on [us] to focus on locking in and being ready for whatever Yale throws at us.”
The teams split their earlier meetings, with Harvard notching a 52-50 win in New Haven in February before Yale returned the favor last Saturday. Junior Elis forward Justin Sears, the Ivy League Player of the Year, had just 10 points, but came up with two big threes to halt Crimson rallies in the second matchup. After Harvard got to within a point early in the second half, it was Yale’s other first-team All-Ivy player—senior guard Javier Duren—who put the game away with 11 points in the game’s final 88 seconds.
“We expect a battle every possession on the boards,” said junior point guard Siyani Chambers. “Nobody is going to let up, nobody is going to give in. We are going down there expecting a fight from them and that’s what we are going to bring to the table.”
To regain the advantage Saturday, the Crimson will need tostrenghen up on the boards like it did during the first outing. In New Haven, Harvard outrebounded the Elis by 10, getting 17 combined rebounds from its starting frontcourt of sophomore Zena Edosomwan and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi.
In the rematch, Yale flustered the Crimson by throwing four bodies on the defensive glass, slowing down the pace, and using Duren (nine rebounds) to clean the glass. After a fast-paced first matchup, the Elis methodically probed the Harvard defense in the second. Swinging the ball around, Yale found the open shooter time after time—sinking almost 44 percent of its shots from deep.
For Harvard, the change in the game was in results, not process. In Cambridge, the Crimson routinely generated shots they wanted, but watched ball after ball hit off the rim. The Crimson’s best sharpshooter, sophomore guard Corbin Miller, launched nine shots and not one found the bottom of the net. In each instance but one—a forced on-the-run jumper Yale easily swatted away— Harvard coach Tommy Amaker noted afterwards he would take those opportunities every day of the week.
“I don’t think we are going to change anything,” Chambers said. “We played very well for certain stretches, not particularly great in other stretches, but if we do what we do and stick to our identity, we will have a chance out there.”
The playoff may come down to the team’s stars. Saunders, who was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection, had just three points in the second half of last week’s game—beaten on both ends of the floor by Duren, his Elis counterpart. Inside, Harvard had the edge, as Moundou-Missi (21 points, 10 rebounds) dominated a timid Sears, who had more fouls than made field goals.
If, however, the playoff comes down to an errant bounce, Amaker would not be surprised if Harvard needs to call Lady Luck’s number once again.
“You need to be good and you need to be lucky,” Amaker said. “I think it’s obvious when you get to these kind of moments, you need both of those elements to win games like this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s trophy season in college hockey land. The Minnesota bros are blow-drying their mullets, the Notre Dame gents are hitting the ice baths, and Seb Lloyd and the boys are signing three-year deals with Dunster House. It truly is a magical time.
Last weekend, the ECAC bid adieu to Princeton, Brown, Cornell, and Clarkson as Harvard, Dartmouth, Rensselaer, and Union moved on to face the conference’s top four seeds.
For the sixth-seeded Crimson (17-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC), a sweep of the Bears marked an important change of pace. After the hottest start in the country propelled Harvard to No. 1 in the PairWise rankings in early January, the Crimson entered last week’s series without consecutive wins in 2015.  The squad led by coach Ted Donato ’91 now carries a three-game winning streak into Ingalls Rink with a chance to clinch a spot in the semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y.
Although the wins came against the two teams at the bottom of the conference standings, Harvard displayed an electricity on the forecheck that has been fleeting this calendar year. While the Crimson’s top-line constants—juniors Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo—turned in one of their best weekends of the season, perhaps the biggest spark came in the form of the team’s biggest unknown: fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell.
Coming back from an injury that left him in the stands for the better part of two seasons, Blackwell has been better than ever in his first three games on the Crimson’s second line.
His numbers—three goals and three drawn penalties last weekend—tell only part of the story; the five-foot-ten San Jose Sharks draft pick is simply the most fun player to watch on the Harvard roster. He brings a Vesey-level skill set yet chases pucks with an extra desperation, stick-handles with an extra flair, and finishes plays with an extra pop.
Between injury and eligibility concerns, nobody can say for sure how many shifts Blackwell has left in a Crimson sweater. Per Ivy League rules, the Class of 2015 recruit would have just one semester of eligibility left after this season unless he obtains a rare medical redshirt. For now, however, Harvard fans can appreciate No. 63 as he flies up the right wing with reckless abandon.
On to the picks:
COLGATE VS. DARTMOUTH
I’d like to take this opportunity to give a well-earned tip of the hat to @Dartmouth_MIH.
If you are not following the official Twitter account of the Dartmouth men’s ice hockey program, then you are missing out on some dank memes. The account delivers the unfiltered observations of Big Green sports information director Pat Salvas in the form of clips, gifs, and sass. Last weekend’s offerings included a scene from Old School (“We gotta keep our composure”), a gif of Guns N’ Roses lead guitarist Slash (Princeton called for slashing), and multiple tweets featuring the phrase “Sooooo.”
Dartmouth will need all the moral support that Salvas can muster in its road date with Colgate this weekend. The Raiders entered the year as the coaches’ and media’s choice to win the conference but struggled to adjust after injuries to key players. Nevertheless, championship expectations have returned to Hamilton in recent weeks with the resurgence of goaltender Charlie Finn, the return of forward Tylor “I’m Not Tyson” Spink, and a 4-0-1 stretch to close out the regular season.
My college hockey spirit animal Josh Seguin, who covers the ECAC for College Hockey News, told me that he thinks the winner of this series wins the tournament. I don’t know about that, but for now, I’m picking the preseason favorite in two close games.
Pick: Colgate in two
ST. LAWRENCE VS. RENSSELAER
According to a quote on its Wikipedia page, Appleton Arena is the most difficult arena in the ECAC to play in after Cornell’s Lynah Rink. I can’t personally attest to that, but I can say that the home of the St. Lawrence Saints (really, guys?) is by far the most difficult venue in which to write about a game.
Journalists must deftly scale a 12-foot ladder to reach the press box—which really is not much more than a rickety wooden box. Once aloft, the scribes must peer around huge ceiling beams in order to see both sides of the rink, taking care not to fall over the hand railing.
Despite its hazards, Appleton has a certain charm. The seats are wooden pew-like structures, and well-groomed co-eds in matching knit sweaters serve as ushers. The vendors hawk the Canadian fast food delicacy poutine, which I rudely discovered before Harvard’s 5-1 loss in North Country is not homophonous with the French slur for lady of the night.
Getting back to the hockey, all eyes will be on St. Lawrence goaltender Kyle Hayton as he makes his first career postseason start. The wiry six-foot, 160 lbs. rookie posted a gaudy .936 save percentage this year to lead the Saints to a surprise second-place conference finish. But Hayton dipped below the 90 percent save mark in consecutive games for the first time this season in losses at Union and Rensselaer in the final weekend of the regular season.
The crystal ball says Hayton and company get back on track in Appleton.
Pick: St. Lawrence in two
QUINNIPIAC VS. UNION
In perhaps the most compelling matchup of the weekend, the regular season conference champion Bobcats will host the defending national champions at Hamden’s famed TD Bank Sports Center, home of luxury boxes and cantankerous broadcasters.
The legend of fourth-year coach Rick Bennett grew last weekend as his 10th-seeded Dutchmen finished Cornell in Ithaca Mortal Kombat-style with a 7-0 thumping in the elimination game. Bennett is now a perfect 14-0 in ECAC tournament play and is squarely in the hunt for an unprecedented fourth straight conference championship in the Hockey East era.
Although his team this season has been less consistent than Sean Malone’s hair color, the Dutchmen have the winning pedigree to make it happen. Union’s top two lines, highlighted by senior Daniel Ciampini and sophomore Mike Vecchione, are among the fastest and highest-skilled combinations in the nation, and the Dutchmen received key contributions from depth players this weekend.
The Bobcats will have to exploit Union’s off-and-on defense in order to get to Lake Placid. Under the leadership of 21st-year coach Rand Pecknold and captain Matthew Peca, Quinnipiac captured exclusive rights to its second Cleary Cup in three seasons with a 5-2 triumph at Harvard on the penultimate night of the regular season. Yet the Bobcats’ overall body of work indicates a team that is highly beatable. Their two wins against Union this season came in tight, 4-3 affairs.
Expect Pecknold to take the “0” from Bennett, but not much more. I’m going with the trendy upset.
Pick: Union in three
YALE VS. HARVARD
Yale coach Keith Allain is the Bill Belichick of the ECAC. He sports a natural scowl, he’s terse with reporters, and you know that he’s smarter than you.
It’s no surprise, then, that Allain remarked during the height of Deflate-Gate that he’d “deflate a puck if [he] could.”
“You can’t argue with [Belichick’s] success,” the former goaltender added.
You can’t argue with Allain’s success against the Crimson, either. Since ending the Bulldogs’ season with an 8-2 rout in Game 3 of the 2012 ECAC Quarterfinals, Harvard has gone 0-9-1 against Allain’s troops. Donato has only coached his squad to one win at Ingalls against Yale—a 5-3 victory in Jan. 2005 in his rookie season—and has yet to beat Allain in the venue.
This season, only Vesey has beaten sophomore goaltender Alex Lyon over three H-Y contests. After an evenly-played Bulldog win at the Bright-Landry, the Crimson’s forecheck looked stilted in a 4-1 handling at Madison Square Garden and a 3-0 shutout at Ingalls.
As Vesey suggested in Saturday’s post-game presser, the visitors can win this weekend if they can find a way to “out-offense” their opponent. Outside the head-to-head matchups, Harvard has consistently displayed more offensive firepower than its New Haven counterpart, yet has struggled at times to field much of an attack beyond its first line.
Blackwell’s line adds a new wrinkle that the Bulldogs haven’t seen yet. At some point, the dam must break. I see the Crimson breaking through at least once this weekend, but I’m not going to bet against Allain at the Whale.
Pick: Yale in three

PHOTO OF THE DAY
After a student in Leverett placed the head of a bunny, the Leverett House mascot, on the John Harvard statue, another student climbed to toss it in the air during Housing Day on Thursday. Upperclassmen stormed Harvard Yard on Thursday morning to deliver letters to freshmen notifying them of their house placement.
