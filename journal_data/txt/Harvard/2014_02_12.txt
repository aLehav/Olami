After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“The Vagina Monologues,” sponsored biennially by Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response (OSAPR), sets out to unabashedly discuss the taboo issues facing women in a more connected, communal way than years past. “It’s a chance to have a lot of conversations that aren’t really being had,” director Alyssa R. Leader ’15 says. The show seeks to break the fourth wall and instead creates an interactive space. 
 
Producer Zoe A. Bergstrom ’15 agrees. “We didn’t want it to be overly theatrical,” she says. “We want the audience to feel comfortable talking about the issues in the show.” 
 
“It’s going to be a much more intimate production of “The Vagina Monologues” than it was two years ago at Harvard,” actress Brenna K. McDuffie ’15 says.  In an attempt to facilitate this intimacy, the production team chose to move the show from the Agassiz Theater to the much smaller Loeb Ex. However, when it came to shaping this theatrical space, they took it a step further. Couches and cushions, among other things, are made available to the audience in order to recreate an intimate conversation rather than the one-sided experience of viewing a play. 
 
Before audiences enter into this conversation, cast and crew ask audiences to leave their expectations at the door.
 
“Everyone has some idea of what it’s going to be,” Bergstrom says. “If they’ll just sit down and experience it without trying to make it into whatever their preexisting notions are, I think they’ll get a really diverse depiction of all the social issues and all the human experiences that are in the show.”
 
While the issues that the play covers range from orgasms to sexual abuse, cast member Gita Bhattacharya ’16 stresses that the show addresses much more than sexual issues. “The message of sexual empowerment is a metaphor for other forms of empowerment, like being who you are,” Bhattacharya says. 
 
With this message of empowerment in mind, Leaders notes that the group hopes to appeal to a wide audience. “That’s the beauty of it being a series of monologues. There’s something for everybody.”

Up a steep concrete ramp, tucked away in the heart of Boston University, sits the Boston Playwrights’ Theatre, home to new productions from up-and-coming writers. BPT focuses primarily on staging  professional productions of thesis projects from Boston University’s Masters of Fine Arts Program. The theater closes its season next month with Peter M. Floyd’s moving and unconventional new play, “Absence,” running from Feb. 6 to March 2.
 
 “Absence,” directed by Megan S. Gleeson, tells the story of Helen (usually played by Joanna Merlin but triumphantly portrayed by Kippy Goldfarb on Feb. 8) a woman slowly losing her mind to dementia as her husband and daughter try to help her accept the consequences of her disease. Though many stories of this heartbreaking illness focus primarily on the relationships and emotional struggles of patients’ close friends and family, the script of “Absence” distinguishes itself by choosing to focus primarily on Helen’s interior losses. In doing so, the production forces the audience to contemplate the fine line between memory and identity in a way that lingers in the viewer’s mind afterwards.
 
The show is set up to keep the audience confused alongside Helen, and the cast successfully  ensures some perplexity remains for the bulk of the show through their nuanced acting. The set and writing are extremely fluid, making both the temporal and physical transitions fade together. The minimalist set is built mostly of boxes and plexiglass walls that transition from house to hospital to house again. At the beginning of the play, boxes line the front of the small stage and overflow into the audience. Throughout the play, different characters carry the boxes offstage to represent Helen’s slowly deteriorating memory. The plexiglass walls slide open to act as different sets and allow quick transitions and exits. The ever-moving set expands the physical limitations of the small stage. The material fluidity of the set perfectly captures Helen’s memory lapses and unreliable mind.
 
The narration works so that the audience to lose track of time with Helen. At one moment in the play, Helen’s husband, David (played sternly and complexly by Dale Place), tries to convince Helen that they have had the exact conversation a week before. But the repeated conversations are blended together in the narrative, making the audience momentarily wonder whether Helen’s family is cruelly playing tricks on her. This moment is made all the more heartbreaking by Helen’s remaining ability to adeptly name family stories from decades before; she tries to deny the symptoms of her growing illness, but, if anything, Helen’s growing difficulties are emphasized.
 
However, the most affecting portrayal of subtle change comes in the gradual decline of Helen’s ability to understand language. Throughout the play, Helen’s daughter, Barb (Anne Gottlieb), slowly begins interspersing her speech with apparent gibberish. Despite the conscious decision on the part of Floyd to replace lines with nonsensical language, Gottlieb delivers these lines consistently with consistently unfaltering emotion. The fever pitch of Gottlieb’s superb delivery makes the audience feel, just as Helen must, as if they can almost understand her, but eventually it is simply too difficult. 
The most questionable decision in “Absence” comes on stage in the form of Dr. Bright (Bill Mootos), a quirky personification of dementia as well as death. Dr. Bright, a character that only Helen ever sees, delivers some of the play’s most profound lines; the decision to create such a character brings a level of complexity to the semi-traditional tale. However, the execution of many of his scenes can tend toward the awkward. Bright sporadically appears with a bubble gun, aviator glasses, and bananas. Though the character may have been present to inspire laughter, it seemed slightly like a lost opportunity.  Although Dr. Bright’s interruption of the narrative appears purposefully and effectively, the disturbance of tone disrupts the emotional momentum of the play. Without the props and the camp, the character of Dr. Bright could have been a strikingly eerie personage, a modern-day Harvey jovially promising to make Helen a child once again.
 The play grapples with the idea that our memories create both our joys and sorrows. Largely avoiding from melodrama, “Absence” goes beyond the heartbreaking losses of family names, old memories, and speech to the gut-wrenching realization that memory includes the taste of a cinnamon stick, the feeling of a man’s fresh shaven face under her hand, and the sensation of tea warming her from the inside out.  Her memories become more than Helen’s identity; they become her mortality. With a thought-provoking and slippery narrative, Floyd challenges the audience to question what happens if every small memory that defines us slowly gets boxed up and taken off stage.

The humanities seem to have a half-life approximately that of Caesium-137. On some campuses, arts majors are more difficult to find than gluons. The humanities today have less stature than the fossils of Homo floresiensis.
 
The number of humanities degrees awarded has decreased by half since 1967, sparking an increasingly urgent debate about the role of the humanities in a 21st century education.
 
Last fall The Crimson joined a crescendo of pundits and scholars in critiquing the humanities for their impracticality and irrelevance in an increasingly digitized world. But before we repurpose Hemingway and Steinbeck into kindling over which to roast our former English teachers, perhaps we should consider why we seek education in the first place.
 
The cliché is that the purpose of a liberal arts education is to teach us to live more “fulfilling” lives. Like many well-worn platitudes, there is some truth behind the pretty rhetoric. That’s because the humanities allow us to recognize the power of our consciousness to interpret the world around us.
 
Generally when we learn something, we learn it within a very narrowly defined context, such as the history of 7th century Ireland or the transcription of DNA. That information, though useful in context, is meaningless in our everyday lives because we live neither in medieval Europe nor in the nucleus of a cell. For knowledge to have relevance to our everyday lives, we have to make it relevant. That requires the conscious drawing of connections among radically different genres of experience, knowledge, and existence.
 
The traditional approach to learning focuses on specialization, dividing education into various fields, which are further broken down into smaller, individual courses. This model is very efficient at producing graduates with discrete skills, but it also encourages the compartmentalization of knowledge. This helps us prevent the misapplication of ideas from one genre to another: It keeps Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle from making us disbelieve the GPS in our moving car. But it may also make it harder to step back and recognize the broader themes interwoven throughout our studies. Sometimes it’s not what you know, but what you are uncertain of that ends up mattering most. Perhaps that’s the greater lesson from Heisenberg.
 
Or maybe it isn’t. The point isn’t that there is any single “correct” life lesson to divine from the study of quantum mechanics, or economics, or any field. The point is that if you fail to consider the larger significance of the everyday problems you struggle with, then in a certain sense you are missing out on life. You may be a great athlete or musician, but the patience, hard work, and determination you apply in your area of expertise will not carry over to other endeavors unless you work consciously to make it so that they do. Learning from experience requires the de-compartmentalization of knowledge from one area of life and applying it to others.
 
Science and the social sciences give us important tools with which to think about the world. You won’t be able to think as coherently about issues and events if you don’t understand the concepts of present value and marginal cost, or if you can’t distinguish correlation from causation. But the humanities also offer important tools, useful for other kinds of critical analysis of the world.
 
Science draws conclusions in a context that is concrete and clearly defined; the humanities force you to draw connections in a context that is opaque, with concepts that are ill-defined and unrelated. Emerson and Fitzgerald force you to think outside the box, encouraging the kind of open-mindedness that pays dividends when it’s your own life you're reflecting on and not Gatsby’s.
 
The philosopher Thomas Nagel pointed out that, even with a perfectly complete objective description of what a bat is, it is still coherent to ask the question, “What is it like to be a bat?” That’s because that final bit of information detailing what it is like to be something—the phenomenon we commonly refer to as consciousness—is in principle unquantifiable and irreducible.
 
So it is of bats and men. No outsider will ever be able to tell you what it is like to live your life. That’s why the sciences will never replace the study of what it means to be human—the human experience is not reducible to the neurons and electrodes that make it possible. The phenomenology of experience is a peculiar perspective reserved for the pages of literature, musings of esoteric philosophers, and the actual lives we live.
 
Only you can answer what it is like to be a human. Now comes the messy work of living.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Universities across the nation have been witnessing a decrease in the ratio of faculty (including professors, lecturers, and researchers) to administrators (deans, provosts, IT personnel, and the like), reflecting a tendency towards organizational complexity and expanded goals. Harvard, among a few small private universities, has actually been following quite the opposite trend, with our faculty to administrator ratio rising by almost 20 percent to 1.9 in the period from 2000 to 2012.
Harvard has historically had a low faculty to administrator ratio, well below its peer average to start the last decade at 1.57 to one. Our recent gains are only just now bringing us close to the mean. But this is progress. And the University’s evident commitment to the expansion of faculty positions is encouraging. Limiting administrative growth in favor of faculty investment enhances the student experience and improves Harvard’s research output. It also limits administrative costs often met through hikes in tuition—although, naturally, some spending on administrative expansion is necessary for an efficiently functioning world-class university.
 Increased spending nationwide on new administrators has lead to “administrative bloat,” a condition marked by a skyrocketing number of deans charged with increasingly narrow and specialized responsibilities. Even here at Harvard, the Medical School has seen its number of both academic and administrative deans rise from one to nine since the 1960s, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences reached over 3,000 administrators and staff. Many have criticized this ubiquitous expansion as unnecessary, and in fact, one study at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities exposed the redundancy in the duties of its school’s eight vice presidents, culminating in the university’s decision to eliminate a position.
 Administrative expansion, which includes personnel involved in the admissions process and other non-faculty positions, has been linked to higher tuition costs. Limiting staff growth in the way that Harvard has in the past decade helps to keep an already staggering tuition sum down. As we continue to grow and admit record class sizes, a growing share of faculty preserves opportunities for students.
 Nevertheless, we do recognize the importance of administrators in our University setting. It would be shortsighted to bifurcate all employees into good faculty and bad staff. Administrative expansion manifests itself in everything from our vital IT department, a sector nonexistent decades ago, to HarvardX, with its goal of making education available to all. 
 Acknowledging the school’s need for a developed administrative infrastructure, we appreciate that Harvard seems to be directing its primary focus toward strengthening the quality of its core education. This emphasis should bolster both Harvard’s pedagogy and its contributions to academia and the world.

Cross Anderson Bridge and you will see a different side of Harvard. Enter the athletic complex and you will find a space for education unlike any classroom this side of the Charles.
Nearly one in six students make this daily trek to find community, to develop personally, and to contribute to the College as a whole. We like to call these students “student-athletes.”
But what is the “student-athlete?” 
According to the Buffalo Law Review, the NCAA conjured up this “ubiquitous watchword” in response to court cases that threatened to dub college athletes employees. Since the 1950s, the “student-athlete” epithet has evolved to carry several connotations—preeminent among these is the jock stereotype, leading to heated debates on admissions, recruiting, and the role of athletics in higher education.
Over this past month, new debate about athletes as employees emerged, further obfuscating the meaning of the “student-athlete.”
Revisiting the problematic history of the student-athlete, football players at Northwestern University have petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to unionize. Should the students succeed, thousands of American college athletes who bring in billions annually would be recognized as employees under the law. 
The students are not pushing for a so-called “pay-for-play” plan, but instead say that they want programs and academic institutions that are going to be looking out for them. College athletes are often subject to the whims of their athletic programs, with only basic regulation from the NCAA. They must often jeopardize their academic success in order to accommodate their sports. They live with the reality that their athletic program could withdraw their scholarship at the crack of a limb. 
Harvard, however, plays by different rules. Harvard—as a member of the Ivy League—has demonstrated a commitment to the well-being and the education of its athletes. Supported by strictly need-based aid, Harvard athletes need not fear the arbitrary withdrawal of financial support, even if they were to quit their sport altogether. 
Furthermore, Harvard fervently promotes support structures such as the Bureau of Study Counsel and AAPEX, Harvard’s sports psychology and counseling office. Crimson athletes are privileged and supported thoroughly and consistently by Harvard, but the recent push to unionize college athletics has resounding implications for this campus too. 
At its core, the culture surrounding the “student-athlete” is flawed. Something must change; that much is clear.
The University of North Carolina demonstrated the consequences of this defective culture multiple times this year: Athletes reportedly passed a class they did not attend, a  school learning specialist alleged that many basketball and football players read at the level of middle school children, and the same specialist called the cheating she witnessed “overwhelming.” 
Lest we think Harvard has escaped these problems, let us not forget the athletic ties in Harvard’s recent academic integrity scandal, which has prompted the drafting of a new honor code. Further issues have been realized as colleges move to recruit middle school students.
Something must change, but perhaps unionization is not the answer. An employee status would provide several necessary protections for athletes, but it would also come at a certain cost. 
Treating college athletes as employees would alter the way colleges interact with them, only exacerbating the cultural divide between student and “student-athlete.” More importantly, treating athletes as employees tears at the foundation of their educations. Why not simply hire athletes and scrap their classes altogether? Because college athletics should be about far more than fundraising. 
Athletics are about self-development, teamwork, and education. If universities and their alumni boosters see it a different way, that is problematic, but the answer to this problem is not for college athletes to play along as employees. If Northwestern athletes are found to be employees in the law, then athletic culture itself must be scrutinized. 
NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy argues, “This union-backed attempt to turn student athletes into employees undermines the purpose of college: an education,” and I must reluctantly agree. For as much as I would like to defend student-athletes’ interests, I cannot help but see this as a step away from “student-athlete” and toward “athlete,” rather than toward “student.” Universities ought to understand their obligation to student-athletes, just as Harvard has.
Harvard’s athletic department states its mission as “Education through Athletics,” to which there can be attributed no greater justification for sport. It is the reason I practice every day and the conviction behind my force: not employment, but education. 
For without education, what is the student-athlete?

 Becoming a “Lamonster” is a hazardous undertaking. My first (and only) attempt at pulling an all-nighter at the library slowly devolved into a pattern of dozing off, falling face-first into the study carrel, and jerking awake. Even worse, I learned at 4 a.m., was that I’d mistakenly swept my phone off the desk while asleep, and the crack on the screen looked like Harry Potter’s scar. 
 Worried that I would never know when the Quad shuttle would arrive, I emailed my mother. “Mom, I need a phone to study,” I insisted.
 “Why didn’t you listen to us and study engineering? You could have built yourself one!”
 I’m not sure that’s how it works, but thanks anyway, Mom.
 I searched my pockets and found $1.25, an amount already earmarked as an offering to the laundry gods. Unfortunately, the representative at T-Mobile told me they did not accept Board Plus, and they weren’t completely sure what that was. 
 Out of options, I searched online for “free phones”, only to run into an article about “Obama Phones.” Having woken up at 9 a.m. the previous year to vote for the guy, I figured he owed me something in return. 
 “Obama Phone,” more formally known as Lifeline, is a program that, naturally, began subsidizing cell phones under the Bush administration. Most American families who have phone service pay through a 16 percent levy on companies’ interstate and user revenues, to a non-profit that helps expand access for communications services to underserved communities. This organization, called the Universal Service Administrative Company, uses its $8 billion budget to put computers in schools and libraries, enable phone companies to offer service in rural areas (which is ordinarily cost-prohibitive, due to low population density), and provide small subsidies on phone service to working-class Americans.
 This last service, Lifeline, accounts for about a quarter of the budget, with roughly $2 billion in annual reimbursements. Phone companies, such as Assurance Wireless (a subsidiary of Sprint) and SafeLink (operated by Tracfone), receive $9.25 each month to offer a household phone service. Most packages offer about 250 minutes and 250 text messages monthly.
 In order to guide me through the Lifeline application process to get my Obama Phone, I enlisted Hank—whose name has been changed to protect his privacy—a recent subscriber to the program. Hank is a 65-year-old man who sought out phone service to look for jobs; he can’t make rent after having been laid off from his previous job as a janitor for an area restaurant last year, and is on the precipice of homelessness.
 Hank showed me his flimsy phone from Assurance Wireless as proof that he was up to the task. I suggested that we use it to call 1994 and ask if they wanted their ancient cell phone back. But Hank told me that he had been unable to use the phone thus far, because of an astonishingly cryptic activation process. In two weeks, I, too, had received a phone from Assurance Wireless, and I had no idea how to use it. Though well-intentioned, a number of reforms might help me to find a shuttle—and a vulnerable family to communicate—in 2014. 
 As it stands, the reimbursement structure of Lifeline should be changed. Companies receive reimbursements whether or not the phones are actually being used. This policy actually incentivizes providers to make their phones difficult to activate or use, thereby increasing profits, since subscribers are generating revenue without using network resources. Offering reimbursements based on usage, with caps per household, would encourage phone companies to play fair. 
 Moreover, text messages cost nothing for phone companies to send, since they involve miniscule levels of data and are sent over otherwise unusable airwaves. Reimbursements should be weighted to reflect this. Finally, companies should stop aggressively up-selling subscribers or charging steep overage fees to already vulnerable families.Better outreach will allow benefits to reach the families who need them most. Currently, the FCC estimates that only 25 to 50 percent of eligible households are accessing Lifeline services. For Hank, Lifeline means that he can follow up on job inquiries. For a single mother, a Lifeline phone can help her ensure that her child arrives home safely. The added utility in the lives of beneficiaries greatly exceeds the cost, and greater outreach will allow more Americans to share in this. 
 Finally, households should be allowed to apply their benefit toward subsidized broadband access. Many among the 50 to 75 percent of Lifeline-eligible households who don’t tap into the service are paying for completely unsubsidized phone service. Not all have home Internet connections, however, and the importance of web access today is hard to overstate. In many cities, broadband access at the lowest speed tier can be purchased for $20 or less per month. For no extra cost, Lifeline can also subsidize half of that, making the resources of the web available to all. 
 So that’s why I haven’t called, Mom—it’s Obama’s fault. Maybe once they fix this program, I’ll give you a ring.

Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital have found a potential method to slow the onset of Huntington’s disease, according to a study slated to be published in next month’s issue of the journal “Neurology.”
 
A neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects nearly 30,000 Americans, Huntington’s Disease causes cognitive decline, loss of muscle coordination, and psychiatric problems.
 
Lead author H. Diana Rosas, researcher at the Mass. General Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, and colleagues conducted clinical trials that suggested the positive effects of the nutritional supplement creatine. High dosage treatments of creatine were proven to be safe and well tolerated and had the effect of slowing the advancement of the presymptomatic stage of the disease.
 
The study utilized a novel trial design in which individuals did not need to know if they were genetically predisposed to the disease. While most modern techniques require participants to know if they have the genetic mutation that causes the disease, the MGH study enrolled individuals classified as “at-risk”—people with one parent affected by Huntington’s Disease.
 
Rosas believes that this aspect of the study was particularly important because it gave participants peace of mind while also increasing enrollment in the study.
 
“There are still a lot of issues related to genetic discrimination and testing, not the least of which is knowing that you will one day get sick,” Rosas said. “You can imagine what it must be like, living knowing that one day you will develop symptoms of a lethal disease and thinking that every time that you drop a glass or forget where you put your keys, that symptoms have started. We have to find more creative ways to perform clinical trials.”
 
The study followed over fifty participants, the majority of whom had a significant chance of having inherited the disease from one parent.  Half the population took creatine daily while the other half took a placebo.  At the end of six months, magnetic resonance imaging showed that those who carried the disease mutation and consumed high doses of creatine had a slower rate of atrophy in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia than those who took the placebo. 
 
These findings imply that creatine, a compound commonly used as a nutritional supplement for gaining muscle mass, may have some effect in slowing down the progression of early onset Huntington’s.  At present, the full therapeutic uses of creatine are not clear. 
 
“Our data supports the use of creatine early in disease; it is not yet clear how much of an impact creatine will have in symptomatic Huntington's, which is the focus of an on-going, international study,” Rosas said.
 
While creatine’s effect seemed apparent in brain imaging, participants who had taken the supplement did not perform better on cognitive tests than the control group.  The authors noted that creatine might have to be used for much longer periods of time to potentially observe notable results. 
 
Even with the limitations of the study, Rosas is hopeful for the future.
 
“Our ultimate goal is to find the cure; something I hope will happen in my lifetime,” Rosas said.

Nearly two months after the bomb scare that sent law enforcement officials flocking to campus, the College plans to hold make-up tests this week for students whose exams were disrupted by the incident in the fall. According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke, 168 students—including those whose exams were not affected by the bomb threat—will be taking make-up exams this semester, nearly three times as many those in the spring of 2013.
At 8:40 a.m. on Dec. 16, the Harvard University Police Department received an email from an anonymous source stating that live explosives were placed in three academic buildings and one residential building. By 9:02 am, HUPD officers had begun evacuating the targeted buildings, including Sever Hall, Emerson Hall, and the Science Center, forcing administrators to cancel the examinations being held in those locations.
Students whose 9 a.m. tests were cancelled were contacted directly by their course heads regarding the missed exam.
In an email to The Crimson, Burke noted that the make-up exams being held this week will cover 69 different courses, five of which were related to the disturbance on Dec. 16.
“The vast majority of students [whose exams were cancelled due to the bomb threat] took a rescheduled exam either that day or later in the week,” Burke wrote in the same email.
Due to the schedule confusion caused by the bomb scare and by subsequent evacuations that afternoon, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote in an email to the FAS that students who had their examinations scheduled for 2 p.m. that afternoon could also receive special consideration if they felt that the incident affected their ability to study for or take their exams.
 
According to Ellison, professors could choose to give their students three options—make-up their tests in February, opt out of taking their exam and instead be graded based on previous coursework, or request to be graded pass/fail for the course.
Some professors who taught courses whose exams were cancelled chose to schedule additional make-up examinations. Meredith Hegg, who taught Math 18: “Multivariable Calculus for Social Sciences,” said that she scheduled two additional exams—one on the evening of Dec. 16, and one for the following day.
“Everyone was cooperative, but everyone was also frustrated,” Hegg said of her students, who were evacuated just as their final was beginning.
According to Hegg, three students in her class of 14 undergraduates took their exam later that night, five took it the following day, and one is scheduled to take it this week. The rest opted out of taking the final exam.
Richard H. Fallon, professor of Government 1510: “American Constitutional Law” allowed students to take a make-up exam on Dec. 17, opt out of the exam entirely, or take the exam on Feb. 10. 28 students in his course of 233 undergraduates chose to take the make-up exam on Monday.
“I wanted to make sure that no student was made significantly worse off as a result of the bomb scare,” Fallon said. “ I wanted as many reasonable options as possible.”
Shelly Ngo ’17 said although she appreciated the University administration’s flexible final exam policy, she considered her exam’s rescheduling “a big hassle.” Ngo was unable to take a make-up final exam for Life Sciences 1a:  “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology” due to travel reasons.
“It’s been so frustrating because there was so much time in between when the final was supposed to be and when I am actually taking [it],” said Ngo, who will take her final exam on Wednesday. “I just have to keep refreshing.”

Cabot House Co-Master Rakesh Khurana will be spending more time in University Hall next fall after he takes the helm of Harvard College, but he and Co-Master Stephanie R. Khurana said that they will run the Quad House much the same as they have for the last three years.
“It’s my day job that changes more than my master’s job,” said Khurana, a Harvard Business School professor and incoming dean of the College.
“Basically, instead of being across the river, teaching and doing a lot of research, he will be on this side of the river during his day, doing those things,” added Stephanie Khurana, who with her husband has led Cabot since arriving in 2010.
The Khuranas sat down with The Crimson last Wednesday for the first time since the Business School professor was named the College’s next permanent leader on Jan. 22. Sitting on a couch in Cabot Café, the House masters touched on their roles in Cabot and connecting with students, while also reflecting broadly on Khurana’s new role in the Yard.
Stephanie Khurana, wearing a Cabot sweatshirt, said that her family of five enjoys living in the House. She and her husband will stay on as masters even after he assumes the deanship on July 1. “We don’t quite feel like we’re done,” she said. “We got things started. We want to see it through.”
Reflecting on the role he will play in the year ahead, Rakesh Khurana said that he plans to listen to the perspectives of students, faculty, and administrators as dean.
“The ultimate goal of the administrative part of the College is to serve two constituencies: to serve the students and to serve the faculty,” the incoming dean said. “And ultimately the success of Harvard College depends on the success of our community working together, and that to me is the students, faculty, and the staff enabling them.”
 
Still, Khurana recognized the challenges that will come with the new role, although he indicated that he thought it was premature to go into specifics regarding College policy and plans for next year. “I’m going to have to understand how it all comes together, so yes—it will be hard, super hard,” he said. “The good thing is that there are a lot of smart people here.”
Since becoming a House master, Khurana has served on multiple College policy committees. He serves on the Academic Integrity Committee and was one of several members who wrote a recent draft of what would be the College’s first honor code. He also sits on the University’s electronic communication policy task force and co-chaired the College’s alcohol policy committee from 2011-2012.
To interact with undergraduates outside of his own House, Khurana said that he has already eaten with some students at Greenhouse Café, sat down for lunch in a River House, and attended Lowell Tea. In the next six months, Khurana said he plans to reach out to faculty and students to “hear about their thoughts about the College” and “out of that develop an informed perspective.”
The incoming dean indicated that he was a “fan” of Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister and his regular email correspondence with the student body, but added that he would look for his own way to connect with undergraduates. “I think every person has to find...their style,” Khurana said. He and Pfister appeared together at Kirkland House’s centennial celebration last Friday.
Though many have praised the appointment, Khurana said, “it’s not something I had in my career plan....You just don’t know where things take you.”
Khurana was named Pfister’s successor by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith shortly before the spring semester began. Pfister has served as dean in the interim since last July, after Evelynn M. Hammonds stepped down. Khurana will be Harvard’s first dean of the College of Indian descent and the first in recent memory to serve as a House master concurrently.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most of those who work and study in William James Hall, the news that a 2006 College graduate jumped to his death from the building’s balcony last Thursday came in the form of passed notes, informal emails, and for some, not at all.
Though the death occurred at 9:30 a.m., faculty members and students in the building were unaware of the incident for at least part of the day, maintaining normal routines. The University has continued to withhold the name of the deceased alumnus.
It was not until Thursday evening that Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister sent an email to undergraduates with news of the incident and counseling information. But much earlier in the day, Harvard University Health Services proactively reached out to individuals named in the police report with information regarding mental health support and services, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
For others, though, the news came much later. The chairs of the Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology departments—which are all located within William James Hall—were not formally notified of the death until Monday afternoon by an email from FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
"We were just informed informally by people in the building that the building was roped off and that someone had fallen or jumped from the balcony," said Gary Urton, chair of the Anthropology Department. "That's the only word I heard from anyone until I heard from Mike Smith [Monday] afternoon."
Neal said that several inquiring faculty members in the building were made aware of the incident's investigation on Saturday. Other faculty members were never directly notified by University administrators.
For many, knowledge of the incident that had occurred outside made it hard to work. Sociology Department Chair Mary C. Waters, Sociology Department chair, said Thursday that members of her department had difficulty going about their daily routines.
Sociology lecturer Seth D. Hannah, who teaches a seminar that meets on Thursdays at 11:00 a.m., did not hear about the death until Friday. On Thursday morning, while he noted several out-of-the-ordinary individuals resembling government agents in the building's lobby and a crew of workers repairing broken glass on the 15th floor, Hannah recalls not seeing anything that would intimate the incident took place on the premises.
"I didn't notice anything. I hadn't heard anything via email or on my social networks throughout the afternoon," he said. "I learned what had happened from a professor colleague of mine [on Friday]."
Hannah said that on Thursday morning none of the students in his seminar mentioned anything about the incident.
"I think that under the circumstances what [the administration has] done is reasonable," he said "None of my students were particularly affected—they haven't mentioned it to me since. Nobody in the seminar that I was in on Friday seemed to have really been affected or was speaking about it, despite [the fact] that we were presumably in the vicinity of where it had happened."
The Harvard Chaplains Office will hold a “Vigil of Prayer and Remembrance” in response to Thursday’s incident on Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Memorial Church.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Three months after President Barack Obama announced his decision to nominate Harvard Medical School instructor of medicine, Vivek H. Murthy ’98, for the position of U.S. Surgeon General, Murthy began the process of Senate confirmation last Tuesday.
 
If confirmed, Murthy will be the youngest individual to hold the position since its inception in 1870.
 
According to Jeffrey Levi, an executive director of the non-profit Trust for America's Health who knows Murthy personally, the professor’s initial confirmation hearing to lawmakers “seemed to go very well.”
 
Levi expects there to be a vote in Senate committee by the end of the month and a final Senate floor vote in the near future. He said that he feels optimistic about the upcoming votes.
 
“Under the new rules, [Murthy’s confirmation] only requires 51 [Senate] votes instead of the 60 that would have been needed to break a filibuster” Levi said. “I’m pretty confident that will ultimately happen.”
 
Levi is also looking forward to seeing changes in public health after Murthy takes hold of the reigns at the Surgeon General's office.
 
“I think it’s a very exciting nomination,” Levi said. “I think Dr. Murthy represents in a sense the vision for the future of public health, which is one that bridges what happens in the clinical setting with what happens in the community.”
 
Murthy’s qualifications for the position of “America’s Doctor” stem from his current work as a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate in Boston. Murthy also serves as president and co-founder of Doctors for America, a national organization of physicians that advocates for the Affordable Care Act and other health care reform policies advanced by the Obama administration.
 
According to at least one of Murthy’s colleagues at the Medical School, Murthy has been a standout since he first arrived in Cambridge.
 
Harvard Medical School professor Gerald B. Pier remembers first meeting Murthy during the summer after the Murthy’s junior year of high school, when he attended the Harvard Summer School Program and took Pier’s course on immunology.
 
“He stood out incredibly well because as a high school student, he got the highest grade in the class [and] had the highest score on the exam,” Pier said. “That was pretty impressive.”

UPDATED: Feb. 12, 2014, at 9:13 p.m.
Harvard has put a large portion of its controversial forest holdings in Romania up for sale, according to documents filed in the country at the end of January. The documents advertising the sale were posted in Romanian provinces two days after Dragos Lipan Secu, a former contractor for a University subsidiary, was arrested on charges of bribery and money laundering.
Scolopax, a Romanian company owned by Phemus Corporation, a subsidiary of the Harvard Management Company, posted the fliers at the end of January in 21 Romanian provinces. The Crimson obtained one of the fliers Wednesday morning from the Rise Project, a Romanian investigative group. The fliers were first posted on Rise’s website yesterday and carry the seal of the Romanian government. They are dated January 23, 2014.
Secu allegedly committed the crimes while purchasing timberland on behalf of the University between 2007 and 2009. University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in a statement in late Januray that Secu’s relationship with Harvard ended in 2012. Romanian authorities say Secu conspired with sellers to artificially inflate the price the timberland in exchange for a series of bribes, including 4.45 million lei, or $1.3 million, a 2007 trip to the Canary Islands, and a Chrysler Sebring car.
None of the documents obtained by The Crimson indicated that the sale was related to Secu’s legal trouble.
“This transaction is part of a process that started in November of 2013, prior to the recent reports in the media,” Galvin wrote in a statement on Wednesday night. “The transaction does not affect our commitment in Romania, but because of the ongoing transaction process, we are not in a position to comment any further on this matter.”
Scolopax is attempting to sell over 32,000 hectares, according to the documents. It is unclear what percentage of Scolopax total holdings this figure represents, but in 2010 Sven Rutgersson, a Scolopax official, said that the company owned “around 35,000 hectares of forest and 2,000 hectares of farming land.” According to data from Romania’s Environment Ministry sent to Ziarul Financiar, a Romanian financial newspaper, those holdings made Scolopax the second-largest owner of forestland in the country, behind the government.
Under Romanian law, companies wishing to sell forestland in the country must make the plots available for purchase by the government before putting them on the open market, according to Paul Radu, a reporter with the Rise Project.
Scolopax’s assets totaled more than $126 million in 2011, according to University tax filings. It began purchasing timberland in Romania in 2005, a few  years after the University first began investing in timberland in 1997.
 
In the last year for which records have been released, Phemus Corporation has assets totaling more than $4.2 billion.

The managing director for private equity at Harvard Management Company, Lane MacDonald ’88-’89, will leave his position at the end of the month to become president of Crosby Advisors—a small group of investors that handles the wealth of Fidelity Investments chief Edward C. Johnson III ’54 and his family.
MacDonald has overseen a substantial portion of Harvard’s $33 billion endowment. The Johnson family is worth $26 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
MacDonald only began his tenure as Harvard’s Managing Director of Private Equity in December of 2013. Previously, he had served as the managing director for public markets starting in 2012, four years after joining HMC as senior vice president for private equity in 2008.
“While we are sorry to see Lane go, we recognize this unique opportunity for him to take a leadership role at an important investment office,” Andrew G. Wiltshire, HMC’s alternative assets manager, who oversaw MacDonald’s work, wrote in an internal email obtained by The Crimson. “[W]e wish him well as he joins other HMC alums who have been recruited into top investment positions,” Wiltshire continued.
MacDonald’s departure from HMC does not signify a break from Harvard, however. He currently serves as the chairman of the Harvard Varsity Club, an alumni association for former athletes. MacDonald captained the Harvard men’s hockey team, representing the U.S. in the 1988 Winter Olympics. He is a former director of the Harvard Alumni Association.
Wiltshire wrote that the search for a replacement for MacDonald is “well advanced,” though provided no further details to employees.
HMC’s previous private equity director, Peter F. Dolan ’83, left April 2013 after nearly 20 years of service with no explanation from the Company or University. His departure came at a time when HMC’s performance in private equities for fiscal year 2013 fell behind other types of investments. Jane L. Mendillo, HMC’s president and CEO, wrote that private equity performance was “fair” in HMC’s 2013 annual report. While the endowment’s investment in public market equity saw a 16.3 percent return, the private equity division only slightly outperformed its benchmark at 11 percent return on investment for the fiscal year.
HMC has lost a number of top employees to the private sector over the years, including Jonathan S. Jacobson, Phillip Gross, Robert Atchinson, and Jack R. Meyer in the last decade or so. Jacobson left in 1998 to establish his hedge fund Highfields Capital Management, Gross and Atchinson for Adage Capital Management in 2001, and Meyer, who served as HMC’s chief investment officer until 2005 and went on to found Boston-based Hedge Fund Convexity Capital Management, taking 30 HMC employees with him.
In her 2013 Annual Report, Mendillo wrote that, “HMC is fully staffed on the investment front with highly experienced, high quality talent across the board.” She pointed to the additions of Jake Xia as chief risk officer and Jameela Pedicini as vice president of sustainable investing as examples of new leaders added to the Company.

Philanthropist, musician, actor, and author LL Cool J has been named the Harvard Foundation’s 2014 Artist of the Year.
He will be honored on Feb. 22 at the 29th annual Cultural Rhythms festival, a day-long celebration of campus diversity, which will also feature food and performances from a variety of student organizations.
The first rap artist to accumulate 10 consecutive platinum-plus selling albums, LL Cool J is a two-time Grammy award winner and two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominee. Also two-time NAACP Image Award-winner, he has hosted the Grammys for the past three years and currently stars in “NCIS: Los Angeles.”
According to Neurology professor S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation, LL Cool J is a talented musician as well as a philanthropist and a strong supporter of youth literacy and music and arts enrichment programs in schools.
 
Counter called LL Cool J a “very fine person” and said that he was particularly impressed by the rapper’s involvement in Jumpstart, a program that promotes early education for children in low-income communities with the goal of closing the academic achievement gap.
“We find it very appealing that he has dedicated himself to that,” Counter said.
LL Cool J is also founder of the charity Jump & Ball tournament, an annual five-week program hosted in Queens, N.Y., his hometown. The program serves to encourage athleticism and team-building among young people. In addition, as a member of the Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, LL Cool J helps to raise awareness of the work of the organization.
Cultural Rhythms begins with an intimate lunch reception at Kirkland House, meant for the Artist of the Year to interact with students and “inspire them,” Counter said. Students then perform in skits and roast the chosen artist of the year.
Counter said that LL Cool J was a nominee for Artist of the Year for previous Cultural Rhythms festivals. The rapper was ultimately selected based on the input of student interns at the Harvard Foundation, as well as student organizations associated with the Foundation, he said.
When making decisions for Artist of the Year, the Foundation strives to select individuals who have “made significant contributions to humanitarian causes or efforts to help people improve the quality of their lives,” Counter said.
Recent honorees include singers Shakira, Wyclef Jean, and Nicole Scherzinger.

UPDATED: Feb. 13, 2014, at 2:28 a.m.
The number of women registered for this year’s sorority rush, which took place last week, increased to a record-breaking 272 women.
After hitting a peak of 268 women in 2011, rush numbers took a slight dip during the last two years, remaining constant at 250 women.
 
This year marks the first in which the Harvard chapter of Alpha Phi participated in the rush process, joining the other established sororities Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. Alpha Phi’s Harvard chapter was founded last year, but did not participate in formal recruitment along with the other sororities, as it did not have existing members at the time of rush last year.
 
According to Harvard Panhellenic Council President Jeanie Nguyen ’14, the number of women offered a sorority bid on Saturday remained steady at about 150, meaning that a little more than half of the women who rushed ultimately were accepted into one of the four sororities. 
 
Nguyen, who is also a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, said she was expecting more of an increase in women rushing this year due to the addition Alpha Phi.
 
Total membership remained constant for each of the existing sororities at about 150 total members for Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. According to Nguyen, that number will decrease slightly in the spring when outgoing seniors graduate.
 
“I am really excited about the smaller member classes,” Nguyen said. “It will be much easier to get to know all of the new girls.”
 
In addition to a change in number of total sororities, the Panhellenic Council revamped the recruitment process this year by increasing the number of back-to-back events, according to Nguyen, who said she was “really happy with the way recruitment turned out.”
 
Sorority rush at Harvard has grown in size by 81 percent since 2008, when only 150 people took part in recruitment.

More than 200 members of the Harvard community gathered on Wednesday night in Memorial Church to remember the lives of Angela R. Mathew ’15 and Stephen Rose ’06.
Rose, who graduated with a degree in sociology and was living in the Boston area, jumped to his death on Feb. 6 from the top of William James Hall.
Mathew, a neurobiology concentrator from Albuquerque, N.M., was killed Monday morning in a car crash as she was returning to campus with members of the Harvard Mock Trial Association from a competition in Virginia.
On Wednesday night, community members continued to stream into Memorial Church well after the service had begun, eventually filling most of the seating area. Speaking at the service were University President Drew G. Faust, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, Co-Master of Leverett House Howard M. Georgi ’68, and Kaleigh N. Henry ’15.
After Faust and Pfister opened the program by emphasizing the power and importance of community, Henry, who shared a suite with Mathew in Leverett House, delivered a tribute to her friend.
“She would want us to smile,” Henry said of Mathew. “She would want us to hug one another, spend time together, and remember all the fond memories. She would not want to see us hurt.”
When Henry began to recount her fondest memories of Mathew, some individuals in the crowd—which had sat somberly and silently up until this point—began to laugh along to her tribute. Others stayed silent, while some sniffled softly.
“I often walked past her room late at night while she was working on some pre-med assignment,” Henry recalled, laughing herself. “Angela would always take that time to look up, smile, and exchange a sassy comment, before going back to work for hours.”
After Henry finished, Georgi delivered a short address. He focused on Mathew’s dedication to the community and to mentorship. As president of the Harvard Science Club for Girls, Mathew worked with young girls interested in pursuing a serious science education.
“As the girls she inspired grow up, Angela’s spirit will live on in a new generation of women in the sciences,” Georgi said.
After a five-minute period reserved for silent reflection and prayer, Walton closed the service, focusing on both tragedies and encouraging those in attendance to be diligent in their care for others.
“None of us can control when the bell will toll for us or for loved ones,” Walton said. “We do not know what tomorrow has in store, but we can seize every moment that we do have to let the special people in our lives know that we love [them.]”
After the service, a long line formed as members of the community waited to write their remembrances, prayers, and reflections on memorial boards set-up in a room off the seating area. The boards will remain in place until the end of February.

After 64 minutes of play, it still wasn’t over.
In the final minute of overtime on Tuesday at the Conte Forum, the No. 6/6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team (19-3-3, 14-2-2 ECAC) found itself tied, 2-2, with Boston University (19-10-1, 12-5-0 Hockey East) in what had been a hard-fought, back-and-forth contest all evening.
With 23 seconds left on the clock, Crimson junior Samantha Reber won a face off in the Harvard zone. Seconds later, the Harvard backline had fed the puck down the ice.
“It was going to be an icing,” Reber said after the game. “[Sophomore foward] Miye D’Oench flew down the ice and beat [BU’s] player, [and] made a beautiful pass to [co-captain] Marissa Gedman, who made a unbelievable slide to me backdoor.”
Reber sprinted for the net, just in time to receive the feed from Gedman and slap the puck through the posts.
The junior’s dramatic sudden-death goal with just 10.9 seconds left on the play clock clinched the Crimson’s come-from-behind victory in Tuesday night’s Beanpot consolation contest against the Terriers.
“That was an exciting finish for sure,” said interim Harvard head coach Maura Crowell. “[It was] a good battle back-and-forth. BU is a good team. I think we showed a lot of resiliency in the end.”
The game had been a close one from the beginning, with neither team claiming much of an advantage on the scoreboard or on the ice.
Despite being outshot, 41-32, the Crimson was propelled by the play of sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who registered 39 stops, her second-highest total this season.
A week ago, a slow start felled the Crimson in a 4-3 loss to Northeastern in the tournament’s semifinal game. But on Tuesday, the Crimson came out firing from the start with strong performances on both ends of the ice.
“We were a totally different team this time around in the first period,” Crowell said. “[We] came out and were ready to go, and we had a great first period.”
Despite early offensive pressure from the Terriers throughout the first frame, Harvard struck first with a goal from sophomore right wing Jessica Harvey at 14:51. A shot by junior defender Sarah Edney deflected off Terrier senior goaltender Kerrin Sperry, and Harvey got her stick on the puck in front of the net to record the first goal of her collegiate career.
“It was a great shot by Sarah Edney, and I was just crashing the net hard,” Harvey said. “[I’ve] been working on that in practice a lot, just grinding it out in front of the net.”
BU responded just three minutes into the second frame. Sophomore forward Sarah Lefort launched a shot past Maschmeyer that ricocheted off the top crossbar and dropped straight down on the ice. The goal was initially waved off, but a hooking penalty on Terrier junior defender Caroline Campbell provided officials an opportunity to review the play and reverse the call.
With nine minutes left in the period, BU promised to put another one between the pipes after Maschmeyer lost her stick and a delayed checking penalty on Crimson junior forward Hillary Crowe allowed the Terriers to put an extra attacker on the ice. But Harvard broke up the BU attack and the ensuing power play to keep things even.
The Terriers continued to mount the offensive pressure, outshooting Harvard, 12-8, in the second frame, but the Crimson had its own share of close looks. Sophomore center Mary Parker broke through BU’s defensive line and had a one-on-one breakaway with Sperry, but the puck—and Parker—slid just past the net.
In the final minutes of the second period, Harvard came up with its biggest stop of the night after Elizabeth Parker and D’Oench were whistled for minor penalties 37 seconds apart. Harvard killed the five-on-three advantage to keep the score tied at one apiece heading into the third period.
BU did find success on the power play in the final frame of regulation. Senior center Louise Warren capitalized on a man advantage at 8:44 with D’Oench in the box for charging.
Down for the first time all evening, the Crimson drew even quickly. D’Oench netted her team-leading 14th goal of the season at 12:21, putting back a rebound from Reber. Eight minutes of fast-paced play later, the teams were headed into overtime.
As BU had done all night, the team outshot the Crimson in the extra frame, but Harvard found the back of the net when it counted, recording a win in the Beanpot consolation matchup for the second straight year.
It was a dramatic victory, one the Crimson will savor as it heads into its final weekend of home regular season conference play.
“I think that shows a lot about our team,” Reber said. “I think we’re really excited to come out with that win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a water polo player, beating an opponent’s goalie in the pool offers a unique sense of accomplishment.
Yoshi Andersen, an attacker on the Harvard women’s water polo team (4-1), has felt that sense of accomplishment many times already this season. The sophomore has kicked off the year on a scoring tear for the Crimson and leads her squad with 20 goals through the team’s first five games of the season.
During Harvard’s three-game series at Princeton this weekend, Andersen again found success in the pool. In the team’s opening match win against the Virginia Military Institute on Saturday, Andersen led all scorers with five goals and added two assists to help the Crimson cruise to win, 16-6.
“The thing about Yoshi is how hard she works,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Whether it’s in-season or out-of-season, she always wants to get better and see that translate into her play. She’s a tremendous offensive threat. She shoots the ball extremely well.”
In Harvard’s second game on Saturday—a 13-12 overtime win against Iona—Andersen was a large presence in the pool, scoring three times and contributing two assists to boost the Crimson past the Gaels for the second time in two weeks.
“She’s done a great job for us every game,” Minnis said. “She’s a big time player. I think she’s played at every level from her national team to college now. She’s a very talented player and we’re lucky to have her on our team.”
Although Andersen did not score in Harvard’s 11-8 loss to Wagner on Sunday morning, she had a hand in five of her teammates’ goals to lead the Crimson in assists.
The success is not new for Andersen. Before arriving in Cambridge, she won a gold medal and earned MVP honors for Team USA at the 2012 UANA Junior Pan American Championship. Andersen attributes her most recent offensive outburst to the long hours she puts in both in and out of the pool toward improving her game.
“I think one thing that I try to do is work hard all the time,” Andersen said. “At practice I always try to get a little bit better.”
Last year, Andersen had a successful debut season for the Crimson, tallying 61 goals, 42 assists and 54 steals. She captured team Rookie of the Year honors and a CWPA Southern Division second-team selection.
“She works so hard, so I expect her to continue to grow as a player,” Minnis said. “Right now I think she’s just scratching the surface of what she can do. She’s such a talented player. I think the sky’s the limit for her, and it’s been fun to watch her mature as a player.”
With a year of collegiate experience under her belt, Andersen hopes to take on more of a leadership role for a squad that includes seven freshmen. For Andersen, being a leader involves exposing her teammates to a physical style of play during scrimmages and drills.
“I try to lead by example,” Andersen said. “It may seem like I’m being mean to my teammates in the water by being very aggressive, but I just want to get them to see that type of play, and I think that being aggressive against each other helps us prepare for the really physical games like the one we just had against Wagner and Princeton and all the other really physical teams that are out there.”
While Andersen has raced out to significant individual numbers through the season’s first five games, she recognizes that the months ahead will represent a learning curve as the Crimson incorporates its new players into its system. During practices, she looks forward to the team’s spring break series on the West Coast, where the young team will be tested in the crucible of elite competition.
“When we go to California and face even better opponents like UCLA and UCSB, those are the meetings that I think about when we work out every day to make sure my teammates and [I] are prepared for those kinds of physical games,” Andersen said. “We all push each other incredibly hard in practice; I think that’s why we’re going to get a lot better as a team this year goes on.”
