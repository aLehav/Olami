After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a recent meal at a Harvard dining hall, I was asked about my drab plate of rice and vegetables. “So why’d you become vegetarian?” It is a question that I’m asked frequently, but this time I paused and thought a little harder.
I decided to become a pescatarian during my gap year two years ago. I stopped eating meat and began limiting my consumption of eggs and dairy for humanistic, principled reasons. Like other high-minded liberals, I believed I was single-handedly saving the environment and taking a stand on factory farming.
It wasn’t easy in the beginning. Turning down Grandma Malki’s brisket and forgoing Thanksgiving turkey was a real challenge. But I had a strong moral conviction that my choices were saving animals from unnecessary cruelty and reducing greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. My carnivorous desires were strong, but my ideals were stronger.
So, when asked recently why “vegetarianism,” I was about to launch into my whole spiel about the environment and the evils of factory farming. But, it wouldn’t be genuine. To be honest, I no longer lose sleep over these things. Sure, on an intellectual level I still think it is important to reduce greenhouse gases. But I used to be passionate about my principles. Ideas mattered and were worthy of high levels of personal sacrifice.
Idealism no longer shapes my everyday decisions as it once did. Inertia has maintained my vegetarianism for the time being, but it is merely a tribute to an ever-fading more idealistic self.
I often think about the demise of my idealism at Harvard. Unfortunately, it’s not just a “me problem.” I’ve heard similar sentiments from other students. Though many students continue to be active in service and advocacy projects on campus, I’ve heard from many of them that their passion to “fix the world” has dulled throughout their college years.
These feelings lead to the prevalent “selling out” phenomenon in which some idealistic students shelve their aspirations in public service or social justice in order to pursue more lucrative careers. Less than 10% of the Class of 2019 came to Harvard dreaming of a career in finance or consulting, yet 35% entered these sectors post-graduation. I once thought I wanted to become a high school history teacher — an ambition I’ve since abandoned.
It’s strange that ideals are cast aside at an institution of higher learning where they should reign. Perhaps it is merely a natural effect of young dreamers maturing and becoming jaded by the real world, but I think that something else is at work; I think the daily schedule of a college student leads to selfishness.
In college, the workload is heavy and class time is fairly light. As a result, the majority of students’ days are spent studying, working on problem sets, and writing papers. Classes, extracurriculars, and social life sporadically break up otherwise continuous stretches of work. The value of a period of time in college is measured in the amount of work that can be performed within it.
Not only does schoolwork occupy the majority of time in college, it also occupies the majority of space in students’ heads. When asking a friend on campus how he or she is doing, the response is often about the stress induced by an upcoming midterm or paper deadline. I’m afraid that obsession with the endless amounts of schoolwork has hijacked our minds. By forcing us to devote so much mental energy to our personal challenges, work dulls the world beyond ourselves. An unfortunate side effect of academic rigor can be moral decay.
Of course, classwork is extremely important to our development as students. It refines our critical thinking skills and work ethic. But, students must be cognizant that overwork can become an unhealthy obsession. It can lead to caring only about ourselves and isolates us from the outside world.
I worry about my own idealism. During my gap year, when academic pressure did not exist, I spent a lot of time pontificating about the world and my place in it. I thought often about societal issues. It was a time when I could easily make a rash decision to give up eating my favorite foods due to an impassioned dedication to principles.
Is it possible for me to revitalize those feelings here at Harvard? I hope so. This semester, my goal will be to think beyond myself more. I hope not to get stuck on the academic hamster wheel. When I’m walking around campus and my mind begins to wander, I wish to think about the larger issues I used to care so deeply about, instead of all the looming deadlines that have constantly occupied me during past semesters.
I will likely fall short. My past experience with midterm and final seasons has shown me how intoxicating the grind of classwork can become. But, after a long winter break of introspection, I know that I can care a little harder and do a little better. My New Year’s resolution is to rekindle my relationship with my neglected idealistic side and, once again, answer the “why vegetarian?” question with passion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It sits like a monument in front of my elementary school and directly across the street from my high school. It was once brilliant, daring, and magical, but then became just conspicuous, simple, and even juvenile. This tangle of iron bars which somehow coalesces together into circumferential shape is where I had once swung with glee from bar to bar as an expression of my little self, where everyone was my friend and no one my judge. Prior to college, I’d seen the dome pretty much every school day of my life. But it was only upon my first trip back home from college that the sight of the dome plainly panged me.
I often get scared by realizations and reminders that I am “growing up.” Sure, college is exciting and aspirational, but at what price? Harvard debutante or not, I find myself still yearning to cling on to my childhood innocence, even as it stealthily slips through my fingertips. Perhaps I am just a bit more nostalgic than most. I do tend to tear up on the first and last day of just about anything and typically get a most robust lump in the back of my throat whenever saying goodbye for however briefly. But when the reminiscing ends, I think that I am not so peculiar. And I think that you, too, may miss something about your prior little self.
The essential question for all of us then becomes whether or not we can recapture any of that which we cherished so much from our childhood, but somehow relinquished. As I see toddlers play, I wonder if we can ever again lose ourselves in pure fun without the worry of competing responsibilities even if just for the moment. As I relish their hysterical laughter, shudder at their unbridled anguish, and marvel at the most impressive rapidity with which these emotions so easily interdigitate, I wonder how good it may feel if we can ever again be so bold as to unleash our genuine emotion for all to see. And most importantly, as I hear the fantastical dreams of little boys who want to be in the major leagues and little girls who plan to be movie stars (and vice versa), I wonder if we, too, can still dream so big.
I would like to suggest that by doing what we love, by making sure to constantly seek out pleasure and truth, we may indeed be able to realize and maintain seemingly child-like states of freedom and enjoyment. The approach to achieve such bliss will surely not be the same for everyone, but for all, the prerequisites are trifold. First, we must never stop engaging in at least some activity purely for the derivation of pleasure; the activity must be one that is not graded, judged, or evaluated by anyone, including yourself. Second, the activity must provide genuine satisfaction. Third, it must be something that can be worked into your regular schedule. For some, it may be an afternoon run. For others, it may be found in music, art, dance, or writing.
My brief visit home, one which was filled with tokens and reminders of my childhood world, came to an end just last week. As I departed for my Amtrak train back to Cambridge, I passed by my old elementary school with all its cherished memories once more, recognizing what joy it brought to me in times gone by, but also well aware that I have outgrown that time and place.
And so I continued further along on my journey, recognizing that I need not relinquish my childhood innocence, naivete, or glee while traveling forward. Everything about this recent journey — the independence of traveling alone, the continued growth offered by yet another college semester, and the opportunities for self-discovery and exploration that I knew I was riding towards — reminds me of my entry into the less familiar world of adulthood. Yet I know that I need not fear this new world, which promises to become its own unique, more expansive version of my sweeping childhood dome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During our tenures on Harvard’s campus, we were each popularly elected by the student community to represent and advocate for students’ interests as Undergraduate Council Presidents. Frequently this work was practical: initiatives like creating new secondary fields, changing the academic calendar, or opening the Smith Student Center. Alongside these goals, we also sought to improve Harvard as a community of social justice and a positive force for a better world.
Never in our tenure has a more urgent cause for a better Harvard and world been advocated than Harvard Forward, a motivated campaign to achieve climate justice through divestment in fossil fuel companies and to amplify student voices in Harvard’s governance. We will achieve these objectives with the election of recent alumni to the Board of Overseers and mandated incorporation of the student voice in Harvard governance, and, in so doing, establish Harvard as a moral leader in the fight against climate change.
Members of the Harvard community have led the way in science and policy advocacy for responding to the climate crisis. Even the Harvard Corporation agrees that some practices are "so deeply repugnant and ethically unjustifiable" that the University should avoid them. The Corporation also lays out a framework for assessing environmental factors as they may affect the University's investments. The question of what Harvard can do to combat climate change is therefore a question not of kind, but rather of degree.
So why must Harvard divest?
Divestment stakes the moral claim that the pursuit of returns — even for an educational mission — does not obviate our responsibility for our investments’ impact. Divestment is a strategy reflecting the reality that public policy and market reforms, including fossil fuel companies reaching 1.5 degree compliance, will be achieved by a fierce moral outcry backed by institutional power and money. Harvard’s uniquely powerful global reputation must be put to good use; it surpasses the monetary value of the endowment.
Divestment has demonstrated the ability to change the course of history. In the 1980s, Harvard student and alumni leaders called for divestment from apartheid South Africa. Other American universities had divested from apartheid as early as 1977, but Harvard’s administration resisted action. By 1986, the national movement to divest from South Africa reached critical mass, with the University of California divesting over $3 billion. In 1989, a campaign like Harvard Forward elected Nobel Peace Prize recipient Archbishop Desmond Tutu to the Harvard Board of Overseers on a divestment platform.
Despite our leadership’s resistance, by the fall of apartheid in 1994, Harvard had significantly divested from South Africa. President Derek C. Bok wrote in hindsight in 2015 that the pro-divestment protesters had been “obviously accurate in the case of the issue of investments in South Africa” (while also rightly affirming his moral leadership of Harvard’s other important public divestment, that from tobacco companies, in 1990). Nelson Mandela agreed, saying that the University of California’s divestment was a catalyst that ultimately helped end whites-only minority rule in South Africa. Once again, The University of California has already led the way by divesting its $13.4 billion endowment and $70 billion pension fund from fossil fuel companies. Notably, two of the University of California’s asset managers claim they divested for “the [same] reason we sell other assets: They posed a long-term risk to generating strong returns for UC’s diversified portfolios.”
This time around, we simply cannot afford to wait a decade for our leadership to take action.
Harvard Forward’s proposals to incorporate student voices into the Board of Overseers will enable Harvard to act on climate change, among other student concerns. The current state of affairs limits the extent to which the Board of Overseers can be informed directly by those at the core of Harvard’s educational mission — our students. We seek to formalize an established process for dialogue between the Overseers and students through three annual town halls with at least five Overseers present, in which interested students can be heard, and for semesterly formal presentations by elected student leaders.
The Harvard Forward plan for inclusion of current students and recent graduates in governance are consistent with institutional best practices. These changes would bring the Overseers in line with peer institutions such as Princeton, MIT, Brown, and Cornell, which reserve seats for recent alumni or even current students. On rare but extremely pressing issues like divestment, students’ moral voice has historically led the way and could be heeded earlier when heard directly by the Overseers. Most practical issues considered by the Overseers will not rise to this level of moral urgency, but nevertheless would only be better informed by the addition of student and young-alumni perspectives on improving Harvard.
To our fellow alumni reading this op-ed, we have until February 1st to submit petitions for the Harvard Forward write-in candidates. We need your petitions and your votes in this election. Given the impact we will have on climate change and Harvard governance and the number of voters, this could very well be the most effectively altruistic vote you ever cast. It is in the student interest for this generation and all future generations, on campus and the planet, that we call on Harvard to move forward.
Senan Ebrahim '12 was the Harvard UC President in 2011. Ryan A. Petersen '08 was the Harvard UC President in 2007. Catherine L. Zhang '19 was the Harvard UC President in 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber has been placed on an “indefinite” paid administrative leave after being charged in federal court with failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Lieber was charged with “making materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements” to U.S. government agencies, according to an affidavit filed Monday. The charges come as both the United States government and Harvard embark upon a campaign to curb “academic espionage,” a process by which researchers funnel academic information to foreign governments.
Lieber reportedly lied to the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health about ties he allegedly had to China’s Thousand Talents Plan, per the affidavit. The TTP was established in 2008 by the Chinese government to attract scientists from across the world. The federal government, however, has designated the program a danger to national security.
Lieber also allegedly led Harvard to inaccurately tell the NIH that he had no affiliation with the TTP.
Lieber and his lawyer, Peter Lovitt, did not respond to requests for comment on the case.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University is conducting its own review of the allegations against Lieber. Lieber is not allowed on Harvard’s campus and will not continue his teaching and research duties, according to Swain.
“The charges brought by the U.S. government against Professor Lieber are extremely serious,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard is cooperating with federal authorities, including the National Institutes of Health.”
Swain declined to specify the scope of the University’s review.
The affidavit alleges that Lieber signed contracts beginning in 2011 to participate in Chinese government research programs at Wuhan University of Technology. In return, he received millions in cash and contributions to a Chinese bank account set up in his name.
In one instance, Lieber established a joint Harvard-WUT lab on nanotechnology — for which he served as Executive Director — despite lacking the authority to contract on behalf of Harvard. When University administrators confronted Lieber about the lab and his affiliations in China, Lieber told them that WUT was using the Harvard name without his knowledge, according to the affidavit.
Under questioning from DoD officials in 2018, Lieber stated he was unaware of being in the Thousand Talents Program, despite having signed a contract to join it in 2012. Soon after, he emailed a colleague that he would withhold information from Harvard and government investigators.
Lieber appeared at his Tuesday hearing in a Boston courtroom in shackles and will remain in federal custody until another hearing Thursday, the Boston Globe reported.
Lieber, who studies nanotechnology, has had an illustrious academic career at Harvard. He serves as a University Professor, among Harvard’s highest academic honors, and has won numerous prizes for research.
At a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting in November, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs announced that, following National Institutes of Health inquiries into academic espionage nationwide, the University and FAS formed two new oversight bodies. One reviews sensitive research projects, and the other examines FAS policies to ensure the school complies with guidelines set forth by federal funding agencies, including the administration of federal research grants.
Two other individuals — Chinese nationals Yanqing Ye and Zaosong Zheng — were also charged Tuesday in connection with allegedly aiding the Chinese government in separate cases, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in the same press release charging Lieber. Zheng is a researcher affiliated with Harvard Medical School.
Ye reportedly identified herself falsely as a student on her visa application to study at Boston University and lied about her ongoing military service at the National University of Defense Technology in China, according to the Department of Justice press release. Zheng allegedly lied to Customs and Border Patrol agents in an attempt to smuggle 21 vials of biological research from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to China.
In the wake of the charges, U.S. Representative Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) announced he will introduce a bill “to tighten and better enforce” the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires researchers and other agents conducting work on behalf of a foreign government to register their relationship.
Moulton’s bill would add civil penalties in addition to criminal penalties for failure to comply with the act and also remove the act’s “academic exemption” for countries like China — currently, people who solely work in an academic nature are exempt from registration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rent for University-owned apartments will increase by an average of one percent — with increases ranging from zero to two percent on a unit-by-unit basis — for the 2020-2021 academic year, Harvard University Housing announced Friday.
To determine revised “market rents,” HUH hired a private consultant to analyze three years of data for more than 13,500 apartments — both Harvard-leased and private properties — in Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville. HUH evaluates rent for its each of its 3,000 units individually, and tenants will be notified of updated rates in March.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that HUH can provide housing for up to 50 percent of Harvard graduate students, and the portfolio often reaches “very near full occupancy.”
“Harvard engages in efforts to provide students with access to diverse and well managed properties in convenient locations, as well as programming designed to foster community and strengthen the bonds with University colleagues,” Newton wrote.
Many graduate students still find Harvard housing unaffordable. Shannon G. Bryant, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics, wrote in an email that she and her partner decided against renting a University-owned apartment because of the prohibitive cost.
“We simply could not justify the price tag of a Harvard-owned property,” Bryant wrote. “It seems that it is not in the University’s interest to provide its graduate students with affordable housing options, nor to adjust our stipends and wages in order to render their housing affordable.”
Ian L. Kirby, a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics, wrote in an email that he believes the University’s pricing scheme does not properly consider graduate students’ financial situation.
“It's kind of unfortunate that HUH tries to keep their rent prices in line with market prices, because it's not really competing for the same pool of tenants,” Kirby wrote.
In 1983, a faculty committee determined that market rate pricing — the current price-setting policy — was the most equitable method of allocating Harvard-owned rental units, according to Newton.
Georgia Soares, a Ph.D. candidate in Literature and Comparative Literature, said she spends more than half of her graduate stipend on rent.
“If you increase the stipend by a little bit but then increase housing costs by even more, it doesn't help us,” Soares said. “I think that a wiser solution would be to provide affordable housing to students.”
Newton wrote that the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has increased the standard Ph.D. stipend by at least three percent in nine of the past ten years.

The Harvard Law School chapter of the National Lawyers Guild published an open letter to District Attorney Michael D. Graveley of Kenosha, Wis., in December, calling on the prosecutor to drop all charges against 19-year-old Chrystul Kizer.
Kizer faces arson and first-degree homicide charges after confessing to the murder of Randy Volar, a 34-year-old man who had allegedly sexually abused Kizer since she was 16 years old. Police arrested Volar in Feb. 2018 but released him without bail the same day.
Shortly after, Kizer allegedly shot Volar twice, lit his body on fire, and fled the scene in his BMW.
The Law School student's letter called Graveley’s decision to prosecute Kizer a “cause for concern” and a “breach” of professional responsibilities.
“She deserves empathy and support for the horrible abuse she suffered at the hands of a grown man, not criminalization,” the letter reads. “‘Sound discretion’ and ‘justice’ in this case would clearly look like dropping the charges so she can move on with her life and recovery.”
In a Monday interview, Graveley disputed the research National Lawyers Guilds students had conducted on the case. He said the students did not contact him for information prior to disseminating the letter.
“From my perspective, if you accuse an attorney of being unethical, that's kind of the professional equivalent of accusing someone of a crime,” he said. “I would suggest that before you use an esteemed university’s name and before you cast judgment on the ethics of an attorney, that the least you can do is be sure you've diligently investigated all sides.”
The authors of the open letter declined to comment.
The letter also criticized Graveley’s interpretation of Wisconsin’s “safe harbor” law, which protects victims of human trafficking from criminal charges related to their abuse. Kizer’s defense argued this protection should apply to the arson and homicide charges in this case.
“Your insistence on prosecuting the case against the plan [sic] language meaning of the safe harbor law is bizarre and negligent,” the letter reads. “It seems to come from a place of racist fear of Chrystul, a young Black woman, and should have no place in the administration of the prosecutorial power.”
Graveley said the law has never been used to defend violent crimes, and that it only offers protection for crimes directly related to sexual abuse, such as prostitution.
“The trial court judge disagreed with the defense on that issue,” he said. “This is not an interpretation of the safe harbor law that has happened before in Wisconsin.”
Beyond Kizer’s case, the letter demands that the Kenosha County District Attorney’s Office improve its procedures for handling cases of sexual abuse.
“You have a duty to improve and seek reform for the prosecutor’s office, not to go to extreme lengths to prosecute cases that do not belong in the courthouse to begin with,” it reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small, vocal group of Harvard College freshmen has spearheaded a many-pronged effort to reduce consumption of single-use plastics on campus.
The decade-old Green Think Initiative — housed under the Office for Sustainability — is an environmental advocacy organization geared toward freshmen. Over the past year, its members have appealed to Harvard University Dining Services, Harvard Student Agencies, and the Undergraduate Council to collaborate on reducing major outputs of single-use plastic at Harvard.
Taisa Kulyk ’22, who currently serves as the group’s sophomore advisor, said that while the group boasts a small membership, it has had an outsized impact on campus.
“We started off looking at all the different ways that we could see ourselves, in a semester, making as much impact as possible. And we reached out to a few big players on campus,” she said.
Kulyk approached the UC last spring to propose legislation that would prohibit student organizations from using UC funding to buy single-use disposable plastic and styrofoam foodware for meetings, parties, and other events. The UC voted in favor of the bill, which went into effect this semester, in November.
UC Treasurer Noah Harris ’22, who chaired the Council’s finance committee at the time, sponsored the bill after Green Think Initiative members reached out to him.
“They wanted to ensure that all of these events that we're funding and these parties are acting in the best interest of the environment,” Harris said. “And we came to the realization that of all these parties and events we're having, we're dispersing a lot of funding for red solo cups and plastic plates and non-renewable products.”
Green Think Initiative members have also asked HUDS to reduce its plastic output. Kulyk said that though Harvard’s dining halls currently use biodegradable plastics and have taken other steps to transition to more sustainable materials, she thinks HUDS can still reduce plastic usage at its FlyBy location beneath Annenberg.
“One gap that I really saw was FlyBy,” she said. “I went as an upperclassman for the first time, and I was shocked at how much plastic — everything is wrapped in plastic, and everything goes into a plastic bag as you walk in.”
Kulyk added that the group suggested that FlyBy use stainless-steel bento boxes, which students could scan out and later return.
“We’re really hoping that they will continue looking for the most sustainable option — not taking a stepping stone like bioplastic, but really trying to push forward and have Harvard serve as an example and then try to take that risk to make really ethical and sustainable decisions,” she said.
The group has also reached out to HSA to suggest they phase out their plastic water bottle distribution service.
Aside from reducing outputs of single-use plastic, Green Think Initiative members have tried to improve sustainability at Harvard more broadly.
Last year, Green Think members urged Harvard to install rain gardens on campus after noticing that flooding from rainfall was putting a strain on drainage systems, according to Kulyk. Mather House and Leverett House have since installed the gardens, which consist of plants that temporarily absorb rainwater runoff.
Phoebe M. Fallon ’23 said she joined the initiative because she appreciated the simplicity of its mission and its accessibility to people looking to help make Harvard’s campus more sustainable.
“I thought that it was a way to try and concretely make a difference and affect change,” she said.

A Middlesex Superior Court judge lifted Cambridge’s two-year moratorium on certain cannabis sales permits in a ruling Friday.
The moratorium — passed by the Cambridge City Council in September 2019 as part of the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance — gave “economic empowerment candidates” a two-year window to be the sole operators of recreational marijuana shops in the city.
The measure was intended to help businesses run by people who have been disproportionately harmed by past marijuana laws — primarily individuals from “Black, African American, Hispanic or Latino descent” — according to the Cannabis Control Commission.
The Commission is the state-level entity tasked with overseeing the use and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana.
Massachusetts voters approved the sale and regulation of medical marijuana in 2012. “Adult-use” or “recreational” marijuana was legalized in 2016. Cambridge approved full marijuana legalization by an “overwhelming majority of 71.6%” in 2016.
In October, medical marijuana dispensary Revolutionary Clinics filed a lawsuit against the City of Cambridge in order to block the moratorium, arguing that “Cambridge exceeded its express limited authority to regulate cannabis business” when the City Council passed the ordinance in September.
In an interview Tuesday, Revolutionary Clinics CEO Keith W. Cooper ’83 said the moratorium interfered with existing laws implemented by the Commission.
According to Cooper, stores that entered the business early to serve medical patients — at “pretty high risk” — benefited from the ability to convert their stores into recreational marijuana shops.
Cooper said the previous rule was a “reward for both the investment in the medical business and the risk that was taken.”
“It was also an opportunity to expand the business more quickly because we would have been vetted already with the medical program,” he added.
Cooper said he believes the moratorium restricted his business’s ability to benefit from a recreational marijuana license.
Although city councilors had discussed the ordinance for months prior to its passing, Revolutionary Clinics did not know about the moratorium until “pretty late in the process,” Cooper said.
On Friday, Jan. 24 — two months after the lawsuit was filed — Middlesex Superior Court Associate Justice Kathleen M. McCarthy granted the plaintiff a preliminary injunction. In doing so, the court prevented Cambridge from imposing the two-year moratorium on Revolutionary Clinics and other marijuana dispensaries.
McCarthy’s decision prompted backlash from some business groups in Cambridge. Real Action for Cannabis Equity, an association created to support business owners from underrepresented backgrounds, called the preliminary ruling “a shortsighted infringement on the civic duty and right of local municipalities to prioritize equity” in a written statement released Saturday.
“The preliminary ruling ignores the systemic racism, incarceration, and criminalization of black and brown people that plagued the marijuana prohibition period,” the statement reads.
The court’s Public Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cooper said that Revolutionary Clinics will work with “economic empowerment” applicants in order to make the marijuana business more accessible in the future.
“The first thing I did when I found out on Friday was start to reach back out to the city to let them know that we weren't just going to forget about this victory and forget about those things we told them we cared about — which is growing up equitable industry,” Cooper said.
“We are going to get back at the table to help economic empowerment candidates in Cambridge alongside of us,” he added. “We're not just going to take this victory and turn our backs on that program, we're going to actually support it.”

Papyrus, a stationery store on John F. Kennedy Street in Harvard Square, will permanently shutter its doors.
International stationery chain Schurman Fine Papers — which also owns American Greetings and Carlton Card — declared bankruptcy last Thursday and plans to close all 254 of its Papyrus stores, according to the New York Times. Papyrus’ demise follows a number of  more local recent closures in Harvard Square, including Black Ink and Out of Town News.
In a Facebook post, Papyrus thanked customers for their patronage and assured fans that the brand will “live on.”
“We regret that we are closing all our stores,” the post reads. “We hope that through our artistic, thoughtful greeting cards and our personal expression products that we were able to inspire you to celebrate and honor the special people in your lives.”
Papyrus — which currently has more than 1,000 employees in the United States — struggled with a general decline in brick-and-mortar retail sales and financial concerns stemming from fledgling stores acquired in 2009, the New York Times reported.
Papyrus did not respond to a request for comment.
Papyrus was founded as the flagship brand of the Schurman Retail Group in 1973. In addition to stationery, the chain sold various gift products, including picture frames, writing utensils, gift wrap, greeting cards, decorative notebooks, and alternative types of paper. The company grew to over 500 stores, opening its Harvard Square shop in 2004.
Wesley D. Cash ’20 wrote in an emailed statement that he was disappointed to hear about the closure of the Harvard Square shop.
"It is tearable news that Papyrus folded. I just always assumed that the store would stay stationary,” Cash wrote.
Harvard Square Business Association president Denise A. Jillson wrote in an emailed statement that Cambridge consumers can look to other Harvard Square stores to satisfy their stationery needs.
“People looking to purchase cards, stationery, calendars and unique gifts can purchase them here in the Square at Bob Slate Stationer,” Jillson wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2019-20 season has been a roller coaster for Harvard women’s ice hockey. It is true that the season has primarily featured highs, such as a 5-0-0 undefeated start and another five-game win streak that spanned the winter break. That said, in between the two spotless runs, the Crimson experienced winless 0-4-0 and 0-3-1 stretches. Last weekend, the squad snapped the streak of going on streaks, splitting a weekend series between a win and a loss for the first time this season. The result now in the books and the ship steadied, the season stands at a pivotal moment.
With the split, while the Crimson only gained two of four points against its opponents, the 1-1 road stretch can be a building block for Harvard. Against St. Lawrence, the team fell behind 1-0 in the first yet managed to come from behind with two goals in the second. Knotting the game, first-year forward Cecilie Ehrhard earned an assist and her first career point for Harvard by firing a shot on net, which junior forward Brooke Jovanovich collected for a rebound goal. Breaking the tie, sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere battled through a one-on-one for what would become the eventual game-winner. The tally put Della Rovere at 22 points for the season, second on the team only to sophomore forward Dominique Petrie, who has recorded 27 points thus far in the 2019-20 campaign. With the score locked at 2-1 and the game still up for grabs, the Crimson had to stave off 15 shots and a penalty kill in the third period alone to keep itself in a lead, aided by a 38-save performance from sophomore goalie Lindsay Reed.
Nonetheless, Harvard survived Canton, N.Y. Despite entering the game on a four-game winless streak and facing heavy final-stanza pressure, the team did hold on for a critical win. The next day, against the No. 7/7 Golden Knights of Clarkson, the scoreline ultimately read 4-0, but Clarkson did score three goals in quick succession in the final period to convert the 1-0 nail-biter into a comfortable 4-0 result. Beginnings and ends of periods set the tone for everything that comes in the middle, and by jumping out to a second goal just 35 seconds into the third, the Golden Knights facilitated its two next goals that would eventually ice the contest. While the final showed Clarkson dominating the game, Golden Knights scoring only really defined a period. So, while Harvard is not seeking moral victories when it laces up the skates, in tandem, the weekend results present a path forward.
Despite recent ups and downs, at 11-8-1 and 10-4-1 in the ECAC, the team remains among the best in Division I women’s ice hockey. In fact, in the major polls, the Crimson remains a top-ten team. In the ECAC, the team currently ranks tied for second in league points with 21. However, despite the points lead over all but the Cornell Big Red, who have 26, a trio of teams actually have better winning percentages. Princeton shares second place with 21 points as well, but in one less game. Meanwhile, both Clarkson and Yale sit at 20 points in the standings, and each of the two teams has played one less game than the Crimson, just like the Tigers. So, while Cornell has a decent cushion over its nearest competitors, spots two through five in the conference are largely up for grabs (with a sixth-place Colgate team within striking distance as well). To illustrate the parity among the teams jockeying for top spots, consider Harvard’s performance against them. Against the Bulldogs, the Crimson skated to two wins. With the Tigers, Harvard claimed three of four points but could not finish off Princeton at Bright-Landry. After three unanswered Crimson goals, the Tigers found the back of the net to force overtime in the last minute of the game. And, as mentioned, while a different game than the scoreline may indicate, the Crimson fell to Clarkson on the road. With the Golden Knights, however, Harvard will have a chance for revenge in late February as the upstate New Yorkers make the trip to Boston for a rematch.
With key positioning in flux, there is a lot to play for before the league table settles and sets an ECAC playoff bracket. So, in a series of winning and losing streaks, after splitting a weekend series on the road and ending one of its down stretches, Harvard finds itself at somewhat of an inflection point. While the Crimson only has one game on the books this weekend—against Dartmouth on Jan. 31—this weekend represents an opportunity to shift and stabilize momentum as Harvard prepares for a critical four-week stretch that will determine its postseason fate. The Big Green has only mustered a 5-13-3 record so far, and in the season-opener, Harvard managed to put seven goals past the Dartmouth defense. While the game is winnable—and critical—for Harvard, opponents up and down the ECAC standings have proven that they can hang tight in any game. For instance, against Quinnipiac, a middling team in the ECAC standings that also skated to a tie in one of its matchups against the Big Green, the Crimson barely won a road game in overtime and also dropped a 2-1 decision to the Bobcats. While it is cliche, it is also true—for the most part—that anyone can beat anyone in the league.
What’s more, immediately after the lone game against Dartmouth this weekend, Harvard will head directly into the Beanpot next weekend, facing off against its Boston foes and looking to claim a championship before the season even ends. In the tournament, the Crimson will start in the deep end of the pool, facing off against nationally third-ranked Northeastern. In the consolation or championship, Harvard will see another top-caliber opponent, with another top-ten team in Boston University and a formerly top-ten team in Boston College making up the rest of the field. Although the annual Boston fixture will not count towards conference play, Harvard will have the opportunity to prove it can defeat the nation’s best teams—not to mention the chance to avenge a heartbreaking overtime loss to the Boston Terriers in last year’s Beanpot championship and to claim the Crimson’s first crown in the February showcase since 2015.
Whether against Dartmouth, in the Beanpot, or beyond, the offense will have to reemerge in the near future for Harvard if it wants to play the kind of game that it did immediately before and after the winter break, which saw a road win over archrival Yale and two seven-goal barrages, including on the road against a then No. 9/9 team in Boston College. On the season, Harvard has averaged 3.05 goals per game, but in the last six games, the Crimson has only registered eight, for 1.33 goals per game on average. Even in the win against the Saints of St. Lawrence, Harvard only scored twice. In the preceding five-game win streak, the squad put up 24 goals (4.8 per game). And the goal-scoring extends beyond just generating chances but also necessitates finishing them. In the last game, for example, Harvard and Clarkson completed the game effectively even in shots on goal, yet the Golden Knights walked away with the four-goal advantage.
Only eight teams—and only four automatic qualifiers—ultimately make the NCAA Tournament. Thus, setting up the highest seed possible in the ECAC tournament and building a non-conference resume that could earn an at-large selection set the stakes for the remainder of the season. Conference points are at a premium, and signature non-conference performances provide the icing on the cake to a tournament resume. Both pursuits will be on the table for the Crimson in the next week.
Friday’s game faces-off at 6:00 p.m. at Bright-Landry Hockey Center against Dartmouth, and then Harvard will travel to the Beanpot host venue, Walter Brown Arena of Boston University, on Feb. 4 for a neutral-site showdown against the aforementioned Northeastern Huskies in the tournament semi-finals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball senior guard and co-captain Mackenzie Barta dismissed the idea that her team, which rests heavily on the shoulders of young players, has jitters about the start of Ivy League play.
“We're just super excited because we know we're going into Ivy League quite possibly as underdogs,” Barta said. “That's really exciting for us.”
To kick off Ancient Eight competition, the Crimson fell to Dartmouth in Hanover on Jan. 11. Harvard returned home to Cambridge on Jan. 25 and redeemed itself in a double digit victory against the Big Green. Though the Crimson (10-5, 1-1 Ivy) and Dartmouth (7-8, 1-1 Ivy) each came away with one win and one loss, Harvard surpassed the Big Green in aggregate scoring by 14 points by overcoming its last-second loss with a resounding win.
HARVARD 64, DARTMOUTH 49
Freshman guard Lola Mullaney made a statement in her Ivy League competition debut. Mullaney headlined the Crimson’s victory over Dartmouth, leading both teams in scoring with 18 points. She shot fifty percent from three point range, knocking down four shots from behind the arc. Though the season is just getting started — much like the rookie’s career itself — Mullaney is averaging 17 points through the first pair of Ancient Eight games.
Back in September, Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith told The Crimson that she saw big things in Mullaney’s future at Harvard.
“She may be the best shooter to ever play here if she continues the way she’s going right now,” Delaney-Smith said. “She can be as good as she wants to be.”
Mullaney’s teammates have expressed similar sentiments.
“I love Lola because she's so confident and that confidence never wavers,” Barta praised her teammate. “I’m very proud of her.”
Helping to bury the Big Green, Barta followed Mullaney’s lead, scoring three triples herself. Sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy played a balanced game, tallying 13 points, four steals, and four assists. Senior forward Jeannie Boehm finished just short of a double double, scoring 10 points and grabbing eight rebounds.
HARVARD 62, DARTMOUTH 63
Friday night’s matchup was either team’s game to win. Though Dartmouth took an early lead, Harvard only trailed the Big Green by four points at half time. Through a back and forth battle in the second frame, the Crimson’s first Ivy League game of the season came down to the wire.
Harvard led Dartmouth 62-58 with just under three minutes of game time remaining until Big Green guard Katie Douglas knocked down an uncontested three pointer — her fifth triple of the game — to put her team in a position to take the lead.
Dartmouth went on to do just that.
In the next two minutes, the Crimson and the Big Green exchanged a series of unsuccessful attempts from the field. Harvard still led by one point with under 20 seconds to play.
That is until, on the defensive end, Dartmouth’s Douglas furtively double teamed Barta, ball in her hand at half court, and knocked the ball out of her grip. Big Green senior guard No. 2 Annie McKenna recovered the ball and finished a fast break layup to send the Crimson back to Cambridge with its first Ivy League loss of the season.
Despite the unpropitious conclusion to the game, Harvard stayed true to its playing of unselfish basketball. Three Crimson players contributed double digit figures.
Mullaney led Harvard’s scoring effort with 16 points. Though she only scored six of her points from the three point line — the spot on the court from which she has proved most dominant — Mullaney evinced grit attacking the paint and drawing contact with her opponents. At the charity stripe, she knocked down four of five shots.
Barta scored 14 points and her co-captain, junior forward Rachel Levy, scored 12 points coming off of the bench. As the tallest woman on the floor, senior forward Jeannie Boehm took advantage of her height to grab a career-best 18 rebounds in her last first Ivy League season game.
At Lavietes Pavilion this weekend, The Crimson will host perennial Ivy League powerhouses Penn and Princeton.
Last season, Harvard and Penn proved competitive in Ivy League play. In the teams’ first matchup at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard prevailed over Penn in double overtime. Two weeks later, the Crimson suffered a five point loss in overtime on the road to Penn. At the Ivy League Tournament Semifinals, Penn foiled Harvard’s bid for a spot in the NCAA tournament, routing the Crimson 91-62. 
Delaney-Smith said her team no longer ruminates on last season’s disappointing coda. She said her players treat every game seriously.
“I think every Ivy League game is really important,” she said. “In any given night anyone could beat anyone.”
Harvard will host Penn at 7 p.m. on Friday night followed by Princeton on Saturday at 5 p.m.
