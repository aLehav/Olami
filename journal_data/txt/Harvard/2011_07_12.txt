After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final installment of the Harry Potter movies will be screened in Harvard Square a day early, giving more than 1,600 Harvard employees and students the chance to see the much-awaited movie before its release in the United States.
“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” scheduled to be released to the American public at midnight Friday morning, will be screened seven times in Harvard Square on Thursday evening as a result of an arrangement between AMC Theatres, Warner Bros., and a division of Harvard Human Resources called Outings and Innings.
Devorah S. Sperling, manager of Outings and Innings, has been organizing the Harry Potter pre-screenings since the release of the first movie “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” in 2001. This week’s screening will be the biggest one yet: Harvard booked four of the five auditoriums in the AMC Loews Harvard Square 5 theater on Church Street for a total of seven screenings in 2-D and 3-D.
The tickets went on sale on June 3 for $12 for the 2-D screenings and $15 for the 3-D screenings, but they didn’t last long. By June 9, all 1,658 tickets were sold out, Sperling said.
A franchise that has cast a spell on the lives of this generation of college students since elementary school, Harry Potter has expanded from just a book series to a widely popular phenomenon, encompassing films, merchandise, and even a theme park. Bookstores regularly held midnight parties for the releases of each new installement, and Harry Potter movies consistently grossed eight or nine figures in their opening weekends.
Among those who got pre-release tickets were students enrolled in summer programs at Harvard. Three summer research programs—BLISS, PRIMO, and PRISE—purchased 189 tickets. Harvard Summer School bought 160 tickets, and the Crimson Summer Academy got 110.
Christian L. Garland ’10-’11, director of student activies for Harvard Summer School, said he had underestimated how many students would actually be interested in purchasing the tickets. The program sold 80 tickets for the 2-D showing at $16 and another 80 tickets for the 3-D version at $21.
The tickets, which went on sale at the Summer School’s activities office on June 29 at 9 a.m., were gone by around 11 a.m., Garland said.
Crimson Summer Academy, a program for high-achieving students from low-income families, will be taking their students as one big group free of charge, said Maxine Rodburg, the director of the Academy.
The tickets were also made available to the fellows and student staff of BLISS, PRIMO, and PRISE free of charge, according to Gregory A. Llacer, director of the Office for Undergraduate Research Initiatives.
“It’s a big community hit,” Sperling said.
“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” has a staggered release worldwide. By this Thursday when the early screening takes place in Harvard Square, the film will have been released in more than 30 countries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unarmed man allegedly stole more than $3,000 from a bank in Harvard Square on Monday, according to Cambridge police.
A police officer in Harvard Square Monday afternoon was dispatched to a bank after an alarm was triggered there, according to the report he filed. When he arrived, the teller told him that someone approached her “very calmly” and handed her a note demanding money without dye packs.
Police redacted the name and exact address of the bank, but a photograph provided by police indicates that the robbed bank was Eastern Bank in the One Brattle Square complex.
The suspect was a white male wearing a white baseball cap and white and blue shirt, according to police. The report states that $3,179 was stolen.
A customer, being helped by another employee of the bank, had no idea the bank was being robbed until after the suspect left, according to the report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated July 13, 11:55 a.m. | A complaint filed with the federal Office of Research Integrity alleged that a group of psychiatrists, including an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School, signed their names to an academic paper written by a communications firm hired by a major pharmaceutical company.
 
Gary S. Sachs, a researcher affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital, is one of five doctors identified in the formal accusation filed July 8 by University of Pennsylvania professor Jay D. Amsterdam.
 
The psychiatrists allowed the medical communications company Scientific Therapeutics Information, hired by SmithKline Beecham, to draft a paper using their names, according to the complaint. The paper, according to Amsterdam, suggested that the antidepressant Paxil can help treat some cases of bipolar disorder. 
 
SmithKline Beecham, which has since merged into the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, manufactured Paxil.
 
The practice known as ghostwriting is widely condemned by scientific journals. The World Association of Medical Editors calls ghostwriting “dishonest and unacceptable.”
 
The complaint includes messages sent between those affiliated with the study, as well as their supervisors. The attached messages include professors saying that Scientific Therapeutics Information and SmithKline Beecham selected the first author of the paper and failed to provide the paper to all investigators before submission.
 
But the messages also seem to portray a feud between Amsterdam and University of Pennsylvania Associate Professor Laszlo Gyulai, one of the accused researchers. In one message, Amsterdam accuses him of stealing his research.
 
“As per your investigation there is little doubt that these data were misappropriated from me and used and published without my knowledge and without regard to the significant contribution that I made to this study,” Amsterdam wrote in an email to Gyulai’s supervisor.
 
The paper was published in June 2001, and the research was funded by grants from GlaxoSmithKline and the National Institute of Mental Health.
In an interview Wednesday morning, Sachs, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that while the relationship between Amsterdam and Gyulai was antagonistic, the accusations of research misconduct should be investigated.
"There might be unhappiness between two faculty members, and they might escalate this. But the question is whether there is any basis to this assertion, and this is a very serious assertion," he said. "So apart from whatever motivations there may be, they did raise assertions, and those assertions deserve to be investigated."
Sachs said that he was involved in designing the study and that he saw the paper before it was submitted to the journal.
While he said he did not interact with anyone from Scientific Therapeutics International, he did come in contact with employees of the pharamceutical company.
"The idea that bipolar depression was important to study has been an essential part of my career. Encouraging studies in this field is obviously, as an academic, something I’d want to do," he said. "I was very pleased that they were willing to put their drug to the test. I give them credit of actually having the trial for the drug. Interacting with them in the course of the design and execution of the study, that’d all be standard stuff to do."
 
In a statement, GlaxoSmithKline said that employees were involved in the draft’s development and that the company financially supported the study. It said that the primary authors of a paper have final approval of the draft and that when its employees provide “substantive assistance” to a paper, it is disclosed.
 
“This article was written more than 10 years ago and we do not have details about the development of the manuscript,” a spokesperson said in the statement. “GSK is committed to complete transparency regarding clinical and case studies.”
 
A spokesperson for the hospital said that it is looking into the complaint.
 
“Massachusetts General Hospital takes allegations of research misconduct very seriously and will handle the matter in compliance with our policy to determine if there's any validity to the complaint,” spokesperson Kristen Stanton said in an email.
Sachs said that since the filing of the complaint, he has discussed the matter with a hospital representative.
