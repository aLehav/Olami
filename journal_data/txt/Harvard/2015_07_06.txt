After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ROME, Italy—I was tired. I was hungry. After a grueling, six hour, midnight train from Venice to Rome and nearly eight miles of walking from one tourist attraction to the next, my six other companions and I, on a weekend trip from our study abroad program, were ready for a glass of wine and a full night of rest by 8 PM.
However, over the past few weeks in Italy, I have developed a new sense of guilt that is foreign; it does not arise from offending or insulting others, but rather, from disadvantaging myself. Since I have not had the opportunity to travel abroad often, I am in constant fear that I am not making the most of this opportunity and feel I should jump at any chance to meet new people or explore foreign lands.
Therefore, despite my sheer exhaustion and natural homebody demeanor, I brought myself to join the other girls who were headed to meet up with some fellow Harvard students at a nearby campo, an Italian square, advertised as lively and appealing to people our age.
We never actually made it there—on our way, the loud sound of American music drew us into a local pub filled with college-aged students eating, drinking, and being merry. Nobody was really dancing; with the lights on and people standing at tables, it did not seem like the most fitting setting for that.
That is, until I noticed a circle of drunken, carefree, high-spirited men and women with dance moves similar to what you might bring out at The Owl on a Friday night. Only one difference: they were old enough to be our parents.
These people were oblivious to the mocking, gawking, and judging people surrounding them. I was in awe with about a hundred questions running through my mind. How old were they? Were their children here? Was the balding man spotted grinding on three different women married? After ten minutes of silently judging and staring, my friends and I could conjure up only one answer to our curiosity: join them.
They opened up their circle warmly and before we knew it, we were pulling out our best moves to Fetty Wap’s “Trap Queen” with highly intoxicated people that could have passed for our parents (my bucket list is looking good). It was refreshing to meet people who were comfortable enough with themselves to enjoy themselves in a setting in which they did not quite fit in with appearance, age, and behavior.
Although I have been taught to never ask a woman her age, I was clearly not the only one willing to break social norms, so I went right ahead.
In response to my question, I learned that all of the women were in their late thirties or early forties and obviously about twice the age of every other person in the pub (including the bartenders). That did not shake them; they knew they had every right to be there and were just enjoying life after long hours at work.
Quickly, others joined in on the dancing and after a long night, my friends and I were ready to head back to the hotel. Our new, middle-aged friends, however, were probably the first ones there and the last ones to leave.
After meeting them, I felt inspired to go with the flow, always be up for an adventure, and loosen up on my homebody ways. Before leaving, I complimented one of the ladies I had met, saying that I hope to be as much fun as she when I reach the age of forty. Laughing, she grabbed my hand and with a strong Italian accent, stated, “Oh, darling, it’s easy. Just do as the Romans do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You never forget your first love, and Beijing is no different. Although it’s been over a decade since I last visited the city, its charms were recently renewed for me when I met up with a few friends to go sight-seeing in the capital of China.
AN IMPERIAL PLAYGROUND
Once the playground of emperors, now a majestic tourist attraction, the Forbidden City remains a legend in the hearts and souls of the Chinese people—and for curious souls like me, who are unable to resist the allure of seeing it firsthand.
At the entrance to the Forbidden City, I was greeted by a giant oil painting of Mao Zedong—familiar to me from all the pictures I had seen. My friend told me that they commissioned a new painting every year, due to the damage caused by the weather. (No wonder Mao was looking so fresh for his age.)
The procession of colored umbrellas pulsed as tourists streamed through the open gates and into the palace. There we witnessed the beauty of red walls, grey cobblestone, and intricate gold detailing, replicated over and over on a massive scale. Aware of the historical significance of what we were seeing, we were inundated with an underlying sense of wonder.
Except for the light drizzle (or perhaps because of it), the air was clear that day, seemingly untouched by the pollution that had long ravished the city.
Taking full advantage of this, we made a rather scenic hike through a mountain of greenery up to a little imperial outpost with a fantastic view. We stood within the shaded veranda and gazed out into the world, the summer breeze cool on our faces.
Below us the Forbidden City stretched on for miles, as far as the eye could see.
 
SWANKY EAST ASIAN EATERIES AND THE WONDERS OF PEKING ROAST DUCK
For lunch my friends invited me to eat Peking roast duck, a specialty in Beijing. We hopped into a cab and headed to the Kapok Restaurant (which was located inside of the swanky Kapok Hotel). 
The restaurant had a high ceiling, atmospheric mood lighting, and walls that glittered with gold. The waiter led us through this ritzy establishment to a little alcove with glass floors backlit with LED lights, and huge bay windows that allowed us a premium glimpse into the city.
Soon the table was set with a nice spread: crispy roast duck, marinated meats, sautéed mixed vegetables, thick stew, crepes, white rice, and a choice assortment of sauces. Yum.
Before digging in, I watched as my friend demonstrated the proper way to eat. With a few expert flicks of her chopsticks, she dipped thin strands of celery in sweet and sour sauce, layered it with crispy slices of roast duck, and wrapped it all in a crepe—which she then handed to me.
I spent a few moments admiring her handiwork before devouring the thing.
Many glorious crepes later, we ventured out into the cool, semi-acidic Beijing drizzle, sated, ready to shop.
THE ORIENTAL PLAZA AND NOVEL NEW TREATS

At the generous exchange rate of 6.2 Chinese RMB per dollar, one can practically hear the pockets of American tourists jangling with money. Where better to spend it than Beijing’s Oriental Plaza, the largest commercial shopping district in China?
Since I was the American tourist in question, that’s exactly where we headed.
Store after store sold cute Asian trinkets, snacks, and souvenirs that were clearly catered to foreigners, with prices duly inflated. Meanwhile, high-end brands lined the main streets for the urban elite, with luxury goods several times more expensive than they were in the states.
Turning into what looked like a back alley, we discovered the tourist treasure trove that is Wangfujing. It was a bustling street marketplace, a must-see for travelers, with vendors hawking all manners of goods—from familiar to exotic to everything in between.
What caught my eye first, though, were the scorpions.
Live scorpions wriggled on sticks next to their deep-fried brothers and sisters, followed by endless rows of skewered snakes, crickets, beetles, worms, tarantulas, centipedes and other small creatures that would maybe look tasty, if I were a bird. 
My friends informed me that these crunchy delicacies weren’t the usual fare of natives, either, but were quite popular among camera-toting, novelty-seeking tourists in search of exotic new experiences…and profile pictures.
After staring at multiple clusters of fried bugs in morbid fascination, I finally purchased a more conservative skewer of candied fruits. I’m so glad that I’ve got my Southern sensibilities to keep me grounded in times of crisis.
PUTTING THE "NEON" IN "NIGHTLIFE"
Next (and final) stop: HouHai, a riverfront nightlife district filled with funk, crammed with bars, and populated by expats, tourists, and cocktail-sipping urbanites looking to unwind after a long day.
Probably inspired by the creatively skewered confections that we’d seen earlier today, my friend (who’s quite the foodie) recommended a local kebab place that was nearby. It didn’t take us long to polish off a tray of phenomenal spiced meat kebobs, for about the same price as your average fast food dinner in the states.
Afterwards we took a walk along the narrow cobblestone paths, ready to have some fun.
Neon lights spilled into the evening streets, accentuated by the boom, boom of the live artists performing from the open-air bars; dry ice unfurled onto the sidewalks, where promoters hustled to lure you into their respective establishments (each purportedly better than the last); the river glowed with life, Technicolor from the brightness of the boulevard, and when you closed your eyes against the world you felt the pulse of the city beat in your fingertips, and you remembered how good it felt to be young.
We wandered into a random bar and smiled at each other like little kids in a candy shop. I realized that I couldn’t have asked for a better day, or better people to spend it with, in a city that I was falling in love with all over again.
Drinks were on me tonight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—Every morning for six years, I waited for the first bell to ring in the Commons, an expansive room filled with lunch tables. Thirty minutes to an hour was spent studying every detail adorning the room, every piece of art, every banner. My favorite was a poster that wrote “Welcome” in different languages; it was a sign of my school’s multicultural environment. It made us unique, apparently, so I was proud.
One year after I graduated from my high school, I returned to the Commons during a visit. The thirty minutes ticked by slowly. The image I had known for six years—of unity and the mingling of different cultures, ethnicities, and communities—looked uncanny, unfamiliar almost.
Another year later, I do not even enter the Commons. Instead, I hurry through the hallways, frantically searching for friendly, recognizable faces. I have a partner-in-crime in my quest to greet underclassmen friends and past teachers, but even she notes the isolating changes in our once beloved second home. Two years away is enough to destroy six years of familiarity.
We run into an older graduate. As one of the first Latinos to graduate from my high school with an International Baccalaureate diploma, he talks about the education gap, particularly within our high school where ESL and IB students share the hallways. He’s trying to bring change, he says. His words leave an imprint. My friend and I muse over them, our conversation moving from education to race to queer rights to feminism.
It’s strange. For two years, I forgot about the activist blogs I once worshiped. Immersing myself in my more scientific studies, I stopped spending hours considering the issues in our society. Here, in my high school, was where my social passions all began, and here was where it returned.
The new thoughts have a different taste, however. The world was black-and-white for me on those mornings when I sat in the Commons. Everything was either right or wrong, diverse or homogeneous, good or bad. Proud of my school’s multicultural character, I never considered the complexity of the situation, of the fact that the diversity was one of ethnicity and educational rigor. I was blind.
Absence makes the eyes grow sharper. As I stroll through the building, I see the environment before more clearly. I’m still proud, but the pride has manifested in a recognition of its flaws and a desire for change. Two years away is enough to build new perspectives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By definition, a housewife is a woman whose main occupation is running her family’s household and not working outside the home. She is, for the most part, financially dependent on her husband, the breadwinner of the family.
But the women described in Wednesday Martin’s memoir “Primates of Park Avenue” don’t seem at first to fit the bill. Dressed in designer clothing and armed with Ivy League degrees, the Upper East Side housewives featured in Martin’s book are described as “wealthy, competent, and beautiful women.” And yet, they too are financially dependent on their husbands.
Perhaps the best example of this is the “wife bonus.” According to Martin, the “wife bonus” is a large sum of money that the husband gives to his wife at the end of the year as a reward for good performance at managing the household, taking care of the children, and other wifely duties. Just as an investment banker is reviewed for his performance at work, a housewife is reviewed for her performance at home, and compensated accordingly.
The controversy over the “wife bonus” mainly has to do with whether or not it is empowering to women. Some say very. According to them, women ought to get paid for all the work they do around the house. Housework and child-rearing are just as labor-intensive and respectable as a 9-to-5 job, and housewives should be compensated for their hard work. One woman—herself a beneficiary of the wife bonus—adamantly defends the practice, calling it empowering and feminist because she is getting paid to be a housewife, a lifestyle that she finds satisfying and rewarding.
It’s a compelling argument. For far too long, “women’s work” has been largely undervalued by our society. Domestic work—from managing a home to raising children—is not seen as a worthwhile pursuit. As a matter of fact, when women choose to abandon their careers and dedicate time and energy to their homes, it is often seen as quitting.
This mindset contributes to the stigma that many housewives face. And for many women, the “wife bonus” means that their hard work at home is appreciated and, for the first time, given a real monetary value. In this way, the “wife bonus” is an acknowledgement of the hard work that housewives do every day.
But this argument is far from perfect. It completely overlooks the fact that this transaction is taking place in a marriage. This is not a corporate office where the boss is giving year-end bonuses to his employees. Marriage should be a relationship between equals. Why, then, do people still think it’s okay, even admirable, for husbands to dole out “bonuses” to their wives, as though they are fathers giving their teenage daughters some extra spending money?
It’s because marriage, at its core, is not supposed to be a union between equals. Going back to its patriarchal roots, marriage was intended as a transaction, as a woman is handed from her father to her husband. That’s the reason why brides are walked down the aisle by their father, why women take the surnames of their husbands, and why women wear engagement rings while their fiancés do not. Under the patriarchy, women are little more than commodities. Therefore, in traditional marriages, men are inherently dominant and women are inherently subservient.
This power dynamic is reflected in the division of labor. While men are expected to go out and earn money for the household, women are expected to stay at home, scrub the toilets, and do the laundry. Even women who work full-time spend a week and a half worth’s more time on household chores than men. And from an early age, girls are asked to do more work around the house than boys, with one study finding that girls do an average of two more hours of chores a week than boys.
Therein lies the problem. The problem isn’t that society doesn’t value “women’s work” enough. The problem is that household tasks like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing is deemed “women’s work” in the first place.
This arbitrary, gender-based division of labor carries the assumption that women are intended for the domestic sphere. Women are the ones who are supposed to cook for the family, clean the house, and raise a child or two. Naturally, this takes up a lot of time and energy. Therefore, even if a woman were to work and have a career, she would be confronted with the problem of having to “balance” her work and her life at home. Given that she would be forced to juggle demanding domestic duties with a full-time job, is it any wonder that most women simply choose to become housewives?
Wednesday Martin’s wealthy Upper East Side housewives have been criticized as shallow, lazy, and unambitious. But I think that’s too harsh. The fact that these women have chosen to take their Ivy League degrees and become housewives speaks less about their personalities, and more about the dismal fact that we are living in a society where women are forced to choose between work or home.
In this lose-lose situation, it’s impossible for women to win. Choose work, and you’re a selfish and overly ambitious career woman. Choose the home, and you’re a shallow and unambitious housewife. In this situation, there are no winners—only losers.
