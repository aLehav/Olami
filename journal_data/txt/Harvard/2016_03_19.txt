After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 18, 2016, at 7:09 p.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — Sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman of the Harvard men's hockey team will not play again in this year's ECAC tournament. The 6’7” blue-liner suffered an upper body injury on Saturday in Game 2 of the No. 9/9 Crimson’s quarterfinals series with Rensselaer that left his availability for the weekend in doubt all week.
When Harvard's lineup for the Crimson's semifinals bout with No. 17/- St. Lawrence was released on Friday, Sherman was noticeably absent. Assistant Director of Athletic Communications Brock Malone also confirmed that the sophomore will not play in Saturday's championship game should Harvard advance to play No. 1/1 Quinnipiac.
Sherman did not travel with the team to Lake Placid on Wednesday, but he will be in the stands at Herb Brooks Arena with the rest of the Crimson's reserves, per Malone. Sherman stated Tuesday that he could not comment on injuries.
The Boston Bruins draft selection has played in all 31 games this season and has recorded four goals, a team-high among defensemen. The sophomore has also logged six assists and boasts a plus-nine rating.
Taking Sherman’s place on Harvard’s second defensive unit alongside Brayden Jaw will be freshman Adam Baughman. Sophomore Thomas Aiken will skate with rookie Viktor Dombrovskiy on the third pairing.
On Tuesday while Sherman’s availability remained in question, Jaw said that his defensive partner had been changing every day in practice.
“We have very capable people of stepping up and playing in Wiley’s position,” Jaw said Tuesday. “I’m confident in whoever I’m paired with, and I think we’ll do great.”
Baughman, who made his debut against Princeton on Jan. 29 and has played every game since, will assume that role.
Meanwhile, Aiken has played in just four games this season, and he stands at minus-2. Two of those games, however, were played on an Olympic-sized sheet at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis.
With Friday night’s game being played on “the” Olympic sheet at Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y., Aiken’s experience in the Mariucci Classic may explain why he was given the edge over freshman Jake Olson and junior Victor Newell.
“Our team as a whole has a lot of depth,” said junior forward Tyler Moy, who told The Crimson on Tuesday that he could not comment on the injury but did address the possibility of Sherman being sidelined.
“I don’t think our game plan changes, whatever lineup combination there is," he said. "We have a lot of confidence in the players we have, so whatever happens, I think we’ll be prepared.”
“We have no excuses whatsoever.”
Moy will return to the lineup tonight to center the fourth line after missing three straight games with a lower body injury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 18, 2016, at 6:52 p.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — One year after hoisting the Whitelaw Cup for the first time in nine years, the Harvard men’s hockey team is back in Lake Placid to defend its title.
But the whole defending part? That’s “old news,” says coach Ted Donato ’91.
Fresh off its 2014-2015 title, the No. 9/9 Crimson finished 12-6-4 in ECAC play this year, good for third in the conference. After earning a first-round bye, Harvard then swept Rensselaer in the quarterfinals at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, earning it a trip back to Herb Brooks Arena.
At the world-famous rink, Harvard will square off against No. 17/- St. Lawrence in the second of two semifinal matchups Friday night at approximately 7:36 p.m.
Check back to TheCrimson.com for live updates.
TALE OF THE TAPE
The Crimson and the Saints squared off twice in 2016, with Harvard taking both games. St. Lawrence tamed the Crimson in its own building for two periods on Jan. 15, but a third-period hat trick for Jimmy Vesey—the first of the Hobey hopeful’s career—allowed Harvard to escape with a 3-2 victory.
Then in both sides’ regular season finale, the Crimson spoiled the Saints’ senior night, scoring twice in the final four minutes to close out a 4-1 win over the hosts. The result landed Harvard the third seed in the conference tournament and St. Lawrence the fourth.
Each matchup featured a drastically different style of play. Classify the first as a defensive battle—the two sides combined for less than than 30 shots through two periods before Vesey gave Harvard life in the final 20 minutes.
One month later, however, offense was aplenty as the two sides blew away their shot total at the Bright, combining for 35 in the first period alone. But the two netminders were up to the task. Harvard goaltender Merrick Madsen had one of the best games of his young career, stopping 38 of the 39 shots he saw, while St. Lawrence’s Kyle Hayton made 35 saves of his own.
OLYMPIC ICE
On the Olympic-sized sheet of ice at Herb Brooks Arena, the frantic end-to-end action that highlighted the regular season finale likely won’t be repeated Friday night.
“It [makes for] a little bit more of a controlled and less chaotic game because you have a little more time to make a play,” said senior defenseman Desmond Bergin about the bigger ice. “It’s more about puck possession as opposed to just shooting.”
Nonetheless, there’s no reason to believe that Harvard, who averages 33 shots per game, will see its shot total diminish in Lake Placid. On the Olympic sized-ice at Mariucci Arena earlier this season, the Crimson logged 74 shots in two games.
“I think playing on the big ice surface really plays to our advantage,” senior defenseman Brayden Jaw said. “One of the strengths of our team is that we’re extremely fast and extremely skilled, so I think playing on an Olympic Sheet is definitely going to help us for sure.”
WHERE’S WILEY?
Sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman will not be in the lineup after the 6’7” blue-liner suffered an upper body injury on Saturday in Game 2 of the Crimson’s quarterfinals series with Rensselaer.
The Boston Bruins draft selection has played in all 31 games this season and has recorded four goals, a team-high among defensemen. The sophomore has also logged six assists and boasts a plus-nine rating.
Taking Sherman’s place on Harvard’s second defensive unit alongside Brayden Jaw will be freshman Adam Baughman. Sophomore Thomas Aiken, who has played in just four games this season, will skate with rookie Viktor Dombrovskiy on the third pairing.
“Our team as a whole has a lot of depth,” said junior forward Tyler Moy, who told The Crimson on Tuesday that he could not comment on the injury but did address the possibility of Sherman being sidelined.
“I don’t think our game plan changes, whatever lineup combination there is," he said. "We have a lot of confidence in the players we have, so whatever happens, I think we’ll be prepared.”
“We have no excuses whatsoever,” he added.
Moy, meanwhile, will return to the lineup to center the fourth line after missing three straight games with a lower body injury.

THE SCOOP ON THE SAINTS
St. Lawrence’s top playmakers line up in the defensive end. Backed by Hayton, who sits just three percentage points behind Yale’s Alex Lyon for the top save percentage in the conference, the Saints also feature three defenseman with 15 points or more. By comparison, the Crimson have none.
Junior Gavin Bayreuther, who was named a first-team all-ECAC honoree this week, leads the defensive pack for St. Lawrence. His 11 goals and 28 points are not only team-highs; they lead all ECAC defensemen. Junior associate captain Eric Sweetman, a second-team all-ECAC honoree, has 15 points, and his defensive partner—sophomore Nolan Gluchowski—has 16 of his own, including six goals.
On offense, while the Saints may lack a “go-to” scoring weapon, they boast one of the most balanced attacks in the ECAC—one that has seen five different forwards score either nine or 10 goals this year. St. Lawrence’s top line features junior Drew Smolcynski on the right wing and captain Brian Ward, a Haverhill, Mass., native, at center. Freshman Jacob Pritchard, who cracked the ECAC Media Association’s All-Rookie team, plays the left wing and has at least a point in each of his last 12 games.
WHAT’S AT STAKE
The winner of the bout will face No. 1/1 Quinnipiac, who defeated Dartmouth by a 3-1 margin in the first semifinals matchup, on Saturday in the ECAC championship game with an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament on the line.
While the Saints will likely need to sweep the weekend to go dancing, Harvard could still hear its name called on Selection Sunday if it fails to raise the Whitelaw Cup yet again. However, according to an analysis performed by college hockey expert Jim Dahl, the Crimson’s odds of receiving an at-large bid would grow substantially if it can advance to Saturday.
If Harvard beats St. Lawrence but falls in the championship game, the probability of the Crimson reaching the NCAA tournament is 98 percent, per Dahl. If Harvard falls on Friday, however, that probability would slip to 73 percent.
Nonetheless, the Crimson can increase those odds to 100 percent with two wins this weekend, and that—unsurprisingly—is what Harvard  is after.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its fourth Women’s National Invitational Tournament (WNIT) appearance in five years, the Harvard women’s basketball team (14-14, 9-5 Ivy) struggled to make up an early deficit en route to a 76-50 loss to Hofstra (23-8, 13-5 Colonial).
Playing against a Pride squad the Crimson last faced four years ago at the same event, Harvard couldn’t replicate the outcome of the latter, a nailbiter 73-71 win to advance to the second round of the tournament.
Instead, the Crimson faltered early on after a first quarter that saw Harvard outrebounded by six and outscored by 16.
“They were just hitting their shots and everyone separated. We played horrible, we didn’t not play well in the first half at all,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We did not play well in the first quarter. In the first half there was a period where we had no offense rebounds and they had more offensive rebounds than we had rebounds. It just wasn’t our night.”
The Crimson shot 20 percent through the first frame, making only two threes to end the period down 22-6.
In the second quarter, Harvard made an effort kept up with the Pride on the boards, but struggled to score baskets. Hofstra continued their offensive onslaught, shooting 53 percent through the second frame to take a 41-19 lead into the half.
“They pushed the ball in transition and that put us on our heels,” senior Shilpa Tummala said. “They hit all their shots. We didn’t really have a counter to that. We were getting the looks we wanted, it was just unfortunate our shots didn’t fall.”
In the second half, the Crimson kept up with the Pride, but struggled to close the deficit.
After being outrebounded 11 to 20 through the first half, Harvard doubled the Pride’s six rebounds in the third quarter. Despite the presence on the boards, the Crimson still struggled to hit shots, shooting 8-of-20 from the field and 3-of-9 from the arc.
“We came back stronger in the second half, but we couldn’t hit any of our shots,” Delaney-Smith said. “We played tougher defense and tried to control the boards a little bit, but there wasn’t anything really good about our game.”
The offensive burdens carried into the last frame as well. Despite forcing five turnovers in the last quarter, Harvard couldn’t get shots to drop through the last ten minutes. Hofstra started the period with seven uncontested points to take a 27 point lead and the Crimson struggled to recover, shooting 21 percent through the period.
Despite the late defensive surge, Harvard couldn’t make up for its poor shooting as it gave Hofstra the win and ended the Crimson’s season.
Despite the loss, the last game of Harvard’s season had its share of bright spots. Co-captain AnnMarie Healy scored ten points and added four rebounds—through the season she didn’t fail to score in double digits in a game.
Co-captain Kit Metoyer also sank three three-pointers, moving her to seventh all time in threes made for the Crimson with 127.
Despite the loss, Harvard’s seniors had nothing but fond memories of a program they carried offensively throughout the year.
“This program is a special one and I’ll always cherish the time I played for Kathy and my teammates,” Tummala said. “Unfortunately it does have to come to an end at some point. We didn’t want to see it happen this way, but I’ll have friendships and coached I can count on for the rest of my life.”
Healy echoed Tummala’s thoughts.
“Being a part of this team is so much more than basketball,” Healy said. “At the end of the day it was really hard, but that struggle and that climb is so worth is it just because you’re able to be a stronger person because of it and you’ll make some great friendships for the rest of your life and some really great memories that will stick with you forever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — Prior to Friday night’s ECAC semifinal bout between No. 9/9 Harvard and No. 17/- St. Lawrence, Crimson senior Kyle Criscuolo was honored as the conference’s Student Athlete of the Year. Therefore, it should surprise no one that the Harvard co-captain has a knack for using his head.
With the Crimson’s NCAA tournament hopes potentially hanging in the balance, senior Jimmy Vesey capitalized on his fellow co-captain’s biggest strength 2:18 into overtime. Darting up the right wing and skating around defenseman Eric Sweetman to position himself atop the slot, Vesey banked a powerful wrister off the chin of Criscuolo and into the back of the net to propel Harvard into Saturday night’s ECAC championship game.
“Exactly how we drew it up,” Vesey said.
The goal, Criscuolo’s eighth game-winner of the season, stood after multiple reviews, giving the Crimson (19-9-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) both a 2-1 victory and an opportunity to compete for its second straight ECAC title—this time against the once-top-ranked team in the nation, No. 2/2 Quinnipiac. Meanwhile, the season for the Saints (19-14-4, 11-8-3) in all likelihood has come to an end.
“I thought we deserved better tonight; we’re a very good team,” St. Lawrence coach Greg Carvel said. “Of course, Jimmy’s going to make you pay if you don’t pay real careful attention to him. He scored their first goal and basically scored their second goal. As much as we tried to prepare for him, we still let him get to areas where he’s very dangerous.”
Vesey’s actual goal—a tap-in set up by senior Colin Blackwell a few feet in front of Saints goaltender Kyle Hayton—came less than a minute into the second period, representing all of Harvard's offense in regulation. But with sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen saving every St. Lawrence shot that came his way, the co-captain’s 24th tally of the season was all the offense the Crimson would need to squeeze by.
That is, until Clay Anderson lent the Saints a helping hand. After a Gavin Bayreuther blast bounced up in the air in front of Madsen with 5:24 to go in regulation, Anderson tried to bat it out of danger with his hand. Instead, the junior defenseman wound up flinging the puck into the back of the net, right over the head of his goaltender.
Bayreuther received credit for Anderson's gaffe, which goes in the books as the sophomore's team-leading 12th goal of the year. The improbable equalizer came on the heels of a 14-1 St. Lawrence run in the shots on goal department—a stretch that saw rookie sensation Jacob Pritchard come inches from leveling the score on two separate occasions, just moments apart.
With 8:28 to go, Pritchard corralled a rebound along the end line and threw a difficult shot on net from the red paint. Madsen caught the puck under his arm, but after making the save, the sophomore leaned back toward his net, prompting the referees to review the play. But the call on the ice—no goal—would stand.
Immediately following the review, Pritchard was at it again, ripping a shot from the high slot that hit Madsen, then clipped a piece of the post. The rookie would finally get on the score sheet by way of an assist on the Bayreuther goal a few minutes later, extending his streak of consecutive games with at least a point to 13.
With Pritchard and company pressing hard in the final period of play, the Harvard defense spent much of the final frame on its heels, leaving Madsen to make 17 saves in 20 minutes. But the Saints' high-flying offense came to a skidding halt with 4:05 remaining when freshman Michael Laidley was whistled for boarding—the first penalty of the game.
After the game, Carvel described the call as “disturbing.”
“They almost decided the game, and that’s not their job,” he continued.
Only “almost.” Despite the Crimson's top power play unit being on the ice for the entire two minutes thanks to a Harvard timeout taken halfway through, St. Lawrence completed the crucial kill. But the shorthanded stretch led the Saints’ once-rolling offense to lose its steam, as St. Lawrence registered just two more shots for the rest of the game.
In the overtime period that followed, Vesey, Anderson, and junior center Alexander Kerfoot produced three shots on the doorstep one second after another that nearly wrapped up the game in the second minute of the extra frame. But ultimately it would be the Vesey-Criscuolo connection at 2:18 that sealed the deal.
While Madsen, who finished with 35 saves and wore the Crimson’s player of the game hat during the postgame press conference, was the main reason behind Harvard’s near-shutout, the Crimson’s defensive performance was made all the more impressive by the personnel, or more accurately the lack thereof, skating in front of him.
All eyes were on the Harvard blue line heading into the contest, as Wiley Sherman’s absence left the Crimson with little depth in the back. Aiming to fill a 6’7” void, freshman Adam Baughman moved up a pairing to play alongside senior Brayden Jaw; and sophomore Thomas Aiken, who entered the weekend with just seven career appearances under his belt, stepped in to play on the third pair.
Nonetheless, Harvard’s makeshift defensive unit held its own, forcing the Saints to settle for primarily outside shots and surrendering just a single goal to St. Lawrence for the second time in a row—this time on an Olympic-sized sheet.
“We certainly have some guys that are inexperienced back there,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “This was a great challenge against a team that comes real hard on the forecheck.”
The Crimson now shifts its attention to Quinnipiac, who defeated Dartmouth by a 3-1 margin in the first semifinal matchup of the night at Herb Brooks Arena. After beating St. Lawrence, Harvard is now effectively a lock to make the NCAA tournament, but the Crimson can secure its spot in the 16-team field with a win on Saturday.
