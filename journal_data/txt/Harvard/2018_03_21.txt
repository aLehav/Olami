Shobha Rao’s debut novel “Girls Burn Brighter” begins with a heart-wrenching tragedy, but is not the cause of the numerous horrors that follow. While hard to stomach, the abuses depicted in the novel make for a powerful and unforgettable narrative. In the small South Indian village of Indravalli, a mother falls ill with cancer and passes away. Her daughter, Poornima is now left to the whims of her cruel father who, after the year mourning period, seeks to marry Poornima off.
During this year-long reprieve, Poornima’s father hires Savitha, an impoverished weaver who functions as her family’s main breadwinner. The deep and moving friendship that Poornima and Savitha develop serves as a brief period of light in these women’s intensely dark tales. Once separated, these women face unspeakable cruelties at the hands of not only individual men, but also a society which sees them as little more than objects for public use. Rao powerfully describes a woman’s exploitation and abuse as “a deal, a deal for her body: first for its blooming and then for its wilting; first for her bleeding and then for her virginity and then for her bearing (counting only the sons) and then for her widowing.”
Rao’s novel is as moving as it is infuriating. Through a series of heinous and tragically common abuses, Poornima and Savitha are literally and metaphorically mutilated by society. Though external forces rob the girls of their virginity, their skin, their limbs, and so much more, Rao powerfully writes of how this abuse leads to the loss of something even more essential. Noticing the cold, dead gaze of a girl forced into prostitution, Poornima mournfully notes that “the girl had lost her sense of light.” Though readers may find the sheer scope of tragedy in “Girls Burn Brighter” overwhelming, the crimes which Rao describes are all too common.
Poornima and Savitha’s remarkable inner fires, fueled by their friendship and resistant to the crimes of men, uplifts and inspires. However, the crimes the girls endure at the hands of malicious men inspire not hope, but rage. Each page of Rao’s novel brings forth a new assault, whether it be violent or verbal, sexual or political, implicit or explicit against the very existence of these women. This is not a casual read, one of light fun or carefree entertainment. It is a horrifying, angering, and disgusting book. The novel inspires fury. But it is a fury that needs to be felt.
However, like Rao’s characters, so many women have fought through the systems and the individuals who oppress them. On March 8, hundreds of millions around the world celebrated International Women's Day. Rao’s book reminds that the day is not about upside down McDonald’s arches or gendered bottles of Johnnie Walker, but about survivors, pioneers, and allies, about marches, rallies, and demonstrations. “Girls Burn Brighter” is a reminder of the horrors women still endure today, and the unique strength these women have.

Ramona Ausubel’s newest book, “Awayland,” is no comforting bedtime story. Consisting of 11 short stories, Ausubel takes readers on a journey across ages and strange worlds. Her voice evokes homesickness and heartache, often turning the most ordinary moments into delicate, vulnerable ones. “Awayland” is not just about lands away from home, but rather the loss of home—be it country, family, love, or childhood.
Separated in four sections, the 11 stories are loosely tied together by geographical themes. Though the titles themselves are clever takes on landmarks and ideas evoked across the book (“Bay of Hungers,” “The Cape of Persistent Hope,” “The Lonesome Flats,” and “The Dream Isles”), they do not particularly fit into the titled categories. Instead, many of the best stories in the book successfully journey through the lands listed as titles.
Ausubel’s take on immigration rings particularly loud and clear. In “Fresh Water From the Sea,” a Lebanese mother who moves back home from the States realizes that even though Lebanon was exactly what she had missed all those years, after being home for so long, it, too, has become unfulfilling. Ausubel draws a clever parallel between the mother and her idea of home­—when she feels Lebanon fading away, she, too, literally fades away. The story is told through the point of view of one of her daughters, whom Ausubel just calls “the girl.” “It used to be that I was my love for this place,” the girl’s mother says. When so much of a person’s life is dedicated to missing the place that she called “home,” the idea of home holds unrealistic expectations and becomes an unattainable perfection. In this story, the anguish and the disconnect between seas and siblings resonate when the girl whispers “I can hardly hear you either, in all this quiet” to her sister.
A few stories later, separated by pieces in different worlds with non-overlapping characters, Ausubel tells the tale of the girl’s sister in “Mother Land,” whom the readers discover is named Lucy. Painted as an absent character in “Fresh Water From the Sea,” Lucy is revealed to be a vulnerable and somewhat confused young adult, much more uncertain and drastically more thoughtful than her sister gives her credit for. “My parents were immigrants and my dad spent his life trying to be American,” Ausubel writes of Lucy. “I felt guilty that he would have a foreign grandchild.” This proves central to the cultural identity conflicts of the children of immigrants, a change to a future-looking perspective as opposed to the earlier retrospective view of returning to the home.
Ausubel’s incorporation of motherhood is also important. There are dismissive mothers, overly caring mothers, detached mothers, hopeful mothers, and mourning mothers. “Template for a Proclamation to Save the Species” uses a dystopian micro-society in Minnesota to illuminate all the disappointments in the world that would keep a woman from ever wanting to be a mother, yet also recognizes that those disappointments welcome changes that drive women to become mothers. In “Club Zeus,” a high-schooler named David in white Orange County—where “variation is a nonexistent principle”—goes abroad on a summer trip that reveals just how much even the most independent and responsible teenagers need a mother.
The shorter pieces are delightful, though they offer little to no plot. This makes them the hardest to decipher, but also the ones that should be pondered the most. The opening story, “You Can Find Love Now,” takes a refreshing twist on the modern online dating profile by inserting an ancient character into the plot in a humorous and ironic way. Much irony and thought goes into decoding why the “house at the junction of the River of Stealing and the Falls of Eternal Despair” is in the three-page story, “Heaven.”  Easily overlooked because of their length, these enigmatic but thought-provoking pieces are hidden gems within the book.
Ausubel ends her collection on a rather desolate note with the last story, “Do Not Save the Ferocious, Save the Tender.” At the brink of existence, three desperate men project their loves and lusts onto a washed-ashore mermaid. The struggle is intense, and Ausubel’s words for the struggle is heart-wrenching, the characters themselves at once sickening and pitiful. Like the last story, “Awayland” is not always a smooth read. But beyond the emotional bumps that Ausubel creates, the stories are also heartwarming and depict the intricacies of human character.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a recent monthly faculty meeting, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences discussed a proposal to eliminate “shopping week” and establish a pre-registration system in its place. Many professors expressed concern that “shopping week”—the present course-registration system where students have one week to “shop” and explore courses before making enrollment choices—creates an uncertainty over the size of the class until the very end of the first week of semester. This uncertainty, several professors have said, negatively affects not only professors but also their teaching fellows and their departmental staff. While we understand their point of view, we strongly believe that shopping week is an indispensable opportunity for students to explore their interests.
Unaware of how large their classes will be, professors understandably find it difficult to completely plan their courses. They cannot decide on the number of teaching fellows, who face uncertainty over their schedules. For administrators too, shopping week is troublesome. Stephanie Kenen, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education and Administrative Director of the Program in General Education, has described it as a “bureaucratic headache.”
We recognize these problems shopping week poses to course staff and administrators. However, given how positively shopping week contributes to the student experience at Harvard, we maintain that eliminating it is a bad idea. We strongly support the current form of shopping week and are opposed to any plan or proposal to eliminate it in favor of a pre-registration system.
Shopping week enhances the effectiveness of the liberal arts system of education to which the College is committed. Thanks to a week of exploration of courses, students have the opportunity to consider classes and concentrations they would not have otherwise thought about pursuing. Furthermore, students can have a real experience with a class and its teaching staff before actually enrolling, giving them a chance to think whether a particular class will be a good fit for them. Perusing the syllabus and student evaluations of a course will surely give students information about it, but cannot supplant the experience of sitting in a classroom.
Shopping week also provides Harvard a tangible benefit in student experience over its peer institutions, many of which share the orthodox pre-registration system. In a pre-registration system, students are expected to roughly finalize their courses before the semester even starts. In contrast, with a shopping week like Harvard’s, students can start the semester with virtually no idea about what courses they will end up taking. This allows students to truly experience the richness of Harvard’s academic offerings.
That being said, we also believe that the administration should find ways to address faculty concerns surrounding shopping week without its elimination. We are especially worried about the challenges faced by teaching fellows. We implore the University to act to making their teaching experiences as stress-free and organized as possible.
Finally, we urge our fellow students to take shopping week seriously, which will not only help professors give their courses a robust start, but also prevent students from falling behind in their courses. We are lucky to have such a unique, flexible system. It is up to us to make the most of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One day, we could be walking through the Yard when we first hear the shots. We could be sitting in section or studying in the Science Center on a crisp, sunny morning when someone decides to walk into our university with a lethal weapon and commit mass murder. Though even the idea alone is troubling, and I truly hope this will never come to fruition, our generation cannot dismiss the epidemic of gun violence that has torn across this country. While we need to be active proponents of common-sense gun laws to make progress on this long-overdue problem, we also need to be intolerant of vastly unfounded rhetoric on this issue because of the danger it poses to our society.
It’s not just that we have a gun problem. We have a political problem: The government’s inability to protect us from the gun problem. Despite hundreds of mass shootings every year, our politicians remain unwilling to reasonably address this issue and enact common-sense gun reform. We have seen shootings become routine: The news headlines, the thoughts and prayers, the vigils, and the advocacy for gun reform that ultimately goes in vain. Each time, they follow a predictable pattern. But this routine must end.
In defense of their failure to act, some politicians use arguments so absurd that they become dangerous. Chief among these is the idea that gun restrictions won’t help because criminals don’t follow the law. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, where 17 people were killed in an attack just a few weeks ago, has said that someone who just wants a gun to carry out a crime is not going to follow the law. By this logic, we should make no effort to pass laws about anything. This is the equivalent of saying that we shouldn’t have a speed limit because people who want to speed will do so anyway. And although speeding and committing mass murder are two different things, laws work. In fact, after a national speed limit was enacted in 1973, nationwide traffic deaths went down by nearly 17 percent across the country. It’s hard to imagine how banning assault weapons or reducing the number of guns per person would not result in fewer gun deaths and mass shootings.
Our politicians need to agree that gun safety laws should be enacted. This issue goes beyond partisan divides. Almost all countries that have implemented gun reform laws of any kind have seen a substantial reduction in gun deaths, and it is simple common sense to adopt this lesson from other countries. Our arguments should not be about whether we should enact gun safety laws at all, but rather which laws to enact.
We also must acknowledge that the argument articulated by Rubio—perhaps the least compelling, most unfounded argument against gun legislation—becomes dangerous if we give it any credit. If our leaders continue entertaining these ignorant ideas by accepting the permanence of gun violence, they risk normalizing it more than it already has been. Gun violence is too dangerous and consequential an issue to remain this negligent, and an extreme aversion toward establishing gun safety laws perfectly embodies such negligence. We cannot allow an acceptance of unfounded rhetoric to lead us to take for granted that our nation will experience regular mass shootings.
America’s gun violence epidemic will only be solved by a mass movement of protest, lobbying, and public advocacy because our federal elected officials have shown themselves incapable of legislating common sense alone. The outpouring of advocacy from young people in Parkland, Fla., as well as the marches and petitions sweeping the country, are hopeful signs. But more advocacy is greatly needed. We must discredit the absurd, dangerous arguments flowing through our politics until politicians realize that ignorance can no longer work on this issue. As students of one of the most prominent universities in the world, we must be both outspoken against but also intolerant of the dangerous idea that gun laws won’t work. They will.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard, MIT, and Lesley University employ nearly 22,000 people at sites located in Cambridge. Out of the city’s top 25 employers, eight are biotechnology companies, two are research and development firms, and five are software and internet technology companies. These companies’ workers combine to make another 19,300 individuals, meaning that even without counting graduate students, more than 40,000 people work in Cambridge at its universities and the high-paying employers in its “knowledge economy” that stem from their presence.
If each of these people lived alone, they would occupy nearly 78 percent of the total housing units in Cambridge. Even if each household had an average of two employees in those fields, it would still take more than a third of the city’s housing stock to house each person who works at a university or technology company in Cambridge.
The Fifteen Minutes Magazine housing issue published two weeks ago describes the challenges facing University employees and graduate students, and explains the state of the housing crisis in Cambridge and the terms of debate around it. The pieces shed light on a housing market where demand far outpaces supply, stemming largely from the universities.
The responsibility for meeting this housing demand, however, should fall at least as much on the city itself as on the universities. Cambridge has incredibly stable finances and the lowest residential property tax rate of any city or town in greater Boston. This is largely possible because the city receives 65 percent of its tax revenue from businesses, the highest rate allowed by Massachusetts law. The city also benefits from many community benefits programs provided by universities. In accepting these benefits, the city also accepts an obligation to meet the housing demand of the workers at these institutions, and it has not been meeting it.
While Cambridge has permitted some new units, the Boston Foundation estimated that the city has actually lost a net 95 units of housing since 2011. To its credit, the city has permitted many new units in the past few years, and is the tenth densest municipality in the United States. But this density, coupled with the dearth of housing, is also an environmental hazard, as Cambridge’s jobs-to-housing ratio of 2.6 is far above the window that the EPA describes as “beneficial for reducing vehicle miles traveled,” and does not even include the roughly 30,000 students who attend school in Cambridge but do not live on campus.
If Cambridge fails to achieve housing growth that matches its job growth, these workers and students do not simply disappear. Many pool incomes with roommates, pricing out families in Cambridge, or else move to other communities where their incomes surpass those of other current and potential residents. Either way, the result of this housing shortage relative to opportunities in employment and education is the displacement of low- and moderate-income residents as rents rise.
Cambridge is considering several steps aimed at preventing the displacement of Cantabrigians. Councillor Dennis J. Carlone argued for a council order to draft legislation that would give tenants the first chance to buy their apartments during condominium conversions, and several Cambridge City Council candidates, including two other current councillors, signed on to a petition last fall that would require MIT to provide 1,800 units of graduate student housing. While these proposals, and similar requirements such as inclusionary zoning that set aside specific new rent-restricted units of housing, are a vital part of improving affordability in Cambridge, they can only be successful in tandem with robust increases in housing supply.
There is a simple policy change that the city can make to contribute to this housing supply: moving toward less restrictive zoning. Several candidates for City Council from many sides of the housing debate proposed creating a citywide affordable housing overlay, allowing buildings with affordable housing to build at higher densities than surrounding neighborhoods, and the Housing Committee held a public hearing on the topic in 2015. The city has also made progress by allowing basement housing units. But the magnitude of the housing crisis requires comprehensive zoning reform.
The city’s zoning map reveals the patchwork of densities allowed throughout the city. Further, the neighborhoods with the most restrictive zoning are disproportionately high-income, have had very few multifamily buildings permitted this decade, and have disproportionately high rents and home prices. If the city is serious about creating enough housing to reduce the housing crisis, it should rezone to eliminate policies that restrict development. This would also allow the city to undertake other progressive changes like further increasing the inclusionary zoning requirement with less concern about unintentionally limiting new housing production.
Cambridge is a great place to live for many reasons; we have many jobs, good schools, strong public services, and great public amenities. It is neither possible nor desirable to stop people from realizing this and wishing to live here. We have unique opportunities to extract community benefits from universities, companies, and developers, and the city has done this admirably. But with these opportunities come the responsibility to accommodate the housing demand that is created, and this means allowing much more housing development. When we fail to do so, we shift the burden not just onto Cantabrigians who pay higher rents in the city, but onto communities from Medford and Malden to Meriden, Conn., which must grapple with all of our overflow housing demand without the benefits that come from running a city where everyone wants to be. This isn’t fair.

It is about to be light outside. I hug my arms to my chest and shine the light of my phone upon the wooden balcony, white and bone-like in the 4 a.m. darkness.
There is a small table with a basket of bruised bananas on it; a dresser with a scratched plastic mirror; wooden steps that curve down into the darkness, into the wet underbelly of the house, where earlier that afternoon, I had lolled in a hammock while my host mom crouched beside me, peeling and slicing carrots, occasionally looking up to smile at me, occasionally flicking carrot skin off the edge of her knife.
That afternoon had passed by in a sweltering, dreamlike haze. Chickens pecked around my drooping arms as I picked at a rusty nail on one of the wooden stilts that held up my hammock. It could have been days that I lay there, even years, with only the dull and distant noise of the village’s main road to sustain me. When my host mom got up to leave, I opened my eyes and stopped her with an outstretched arm.
“Do you have—fan?” I could feel the sweat pooling at my back. It was so hot that I could feel the life going out of me, evaporating through my pores. I was dissipating with every second that passed. She shook her head.
“No,” she said, and I watched her skirts drag against the wooden floorboards above as she shuffled into the house. I would get a lot more ‘no’s in the next few hours. ‘No’ to Wi-Fi. ‘No’ to running water. ‘No’ to power outlets. ‘No’ to everything that could have been familiar to me in a Cambodian village that was one boat lift, two bus trips, and a twelve-hour plane ride away from home.
In the dark, I get to my feet, slip on my sandals, and put my earphones in. “Out of the Woods”--again. Taylor Swift’s 1989 was the only music I had downloaded on my phone before the backpacking trip. For the past month—the trains in and out of Bangkok, the Thai islands, Myanmar’s temples, and now, this village—I had only Taylor Swift for every occasion. There was no mood music, no Spotify “Confidence Booster” or “Chill Vibes.” There was only Taylor Swift at all times of the day, for nostalgic nights at the hostel and biking to temples, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
I walk out to the single main street. The red dust that rises up in angry clouds during the day, that clings to everything—bicycle wheels, pant legs, the navy skirts of the schoolgirls that pass by on the backs of motorcycles—is listless on the ground. Most of the rickety shops are closed. There is a circle of sun-browned old men gathered in plastic chairs around a TV in a dim restaurant, but none of them stir when I pass by them.
No one is watching me in this darkness, on this red dust road that hides the sounds of my footsteps, on these stolen slivers of moments in the early morning. I could walk on for as long as I wanted. I could fall asleep on the side of the road. I could get lost in the jungle, so lost that no one would find me, and months later there would be some notice for a foreigner’s body found in the brush but it would just be a paper notice, stuck on a wooden wall in the village’s main hall, for a foreigner’s body found in the brush of the middle of nowhere. In a way, I feel more myself than I have ever felt before.
A farmer crosses my path. He is heading off the side of the main road, towards the open fields where the cows graze. I don’t think; I just follow him.
He stands at the edge of the fence, his back to me, watching two white cows picking at the grass, and he is like a man at a museum. When I stand next to him, he smiles. I take out one earphone, then the other.
As we watch the sun creep up from behind the trees, I can only feel the present, extending from this moment to the next to the next, and it is not terrible anymore but something beautiful. And as I walk back to my host family’s home, back to the porch where I had sat for the entire night, turning my flashlight on and off because that, for some reason, had made me feel less alone, I see a fresh pile of cow dung on the edge of the road and the village beginning to wake up.

At the Museum of Fine Arts “Monuments to Us” exhibit, the usual Friday night foot traffic is interrupted by an array of tables in a U-shaped formation. A hodgepodge of people occupy these seats—some young couples on date night, some old friends on an outing, and some participants with only curiosity as their company. Among them flits Aram Han Sifuentes, handing out colorful string and lending instruction as she sees fit. With her scissors-emblazoned shirt and rainbow eyeliner, she runs this workshop with ease.
To the normal museum-goer, this scene could raise questions ranging from, “Is this an Arts and Crafts table for adults?” to “Is this a group of local citizens and non-citizens learning how to embroider the 100 questions and answers of the United States Naturalization Test?” The latter may seem outlandish at first, but some of the workshop participants otherwise wouldn’t have learned how many members are in Congress (spoiler alert: the answer is 535).
Sifuentes is an Asian-American artist who works with a variety of media to create socially conscious art, often with an interactive component. Fittingly, few things are more interactive than spending a Friday night sitting threading a needle among a circle of strangers. Sifuentes first got the idea for this project when she herself was studying for the citizenship test. She has been sewing since she was six years old, so embroidering samplers seemed like the natural way to study. “I needed to study for the citizenship test, so I started stitching them and then thinking that it would be cool if other people did it with me,” Sifuentes says with a laugh.  Different people contribute to each sampler, and when one is completed, she sells the finished project for $725—the price to apply for naturalization—so that she can donate the money to someone who needs it.
Sifuentes has been incorporating sewing into her artwork for years. Her recent exhibit, titled “Travelling Protest Banner Lending Library,” came to life after the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As a non-citizen and a new mother at the time, she didn’t feel safe attending protests, but still wanted to have an impact. So, she decided to embroider protest banners and make a lending library for them, accepting banner donations so those who feel unsafe attending a protest can still participate. “Make a banner, donate it, and someone else can take it out,” Sifuentes says.
 After Sifuentes’s family immigrated to the U.S. from Korea when she was five years old, her mother became a seamstress and often brought her work home. Sifuentes hopes that, by participating in the workshop, people can see the significance that sewing holds as a practical skill and an entertaining pastime, as well as a symbol of immigrant labor. “I always see sewing as linked to my identity and my experience of being an immigrant,” Sifuentes says.
The workshop is open to anyone who wants to learn more about naturalization, regardless of citizenship status. As people sit around, some struggling while others sew question after question with ease, Sifuentes begins to quiz the group on different questions one might find on the naturalization test. Most people answer quickly and correctly to “Who vetoes bills?”
But that confidence is shaken when Sifuentes works through the list, getting down to the more obscure questions that require specific amendment numbers and ratification years. At these moments, even the most vocal students fall silent, leaving the K-pop music playing in the background to echo throughout the museum hall. It is during these instances that Sifuentes hopes workshop participants think deeply about the types of challenges hopeful citizens encounter on the naturalization test, in order to ask questions like “Is this fair? Is this a good assessment of who is worthy of becoming a citizen?”
Not every person will complete an entire sampler, or even an entire question. Yet Sifuentes encourages participants to write their names and ages in the corner of every square they contribute to, creating a genealogy of seamstresses that continues with the sampler. Many of her projects like the “Protest Banner Lending Library” are ongoing, yet Sifuentes still has ideas for the future. She plans to revamp and expand the “Official-Unofficial Voting Station: Voting for All Who Legally Can't” for the 2020 elections. Also, she aims to continue her “serious, but also very silly and political” artwork with "Put it on Blast, Call it Out and Label it," a sticker book with entries like “This is sexist,” or “This is cultural appropriation.” Her goal is to juxtapose calling out problematic behavior with “kitsch and tacky” images of unicorns and “things that make us laugh,” she says.
In a quiet moment, Sifuentes kneels down to talk to us and tries to teach us how to stitch properly. While it takes us over an hour to shoddily embroider about 10 words, she seems to do 10 per minute, effortlessly sewing words at a speed we could only dream of. Looking around at the paintings and sculptures that adorn the walls of the gallery, she says, “I think it's exciting to be sewing in this space because a lot of people look at these artworks on the walls, and that's what they think art is. But to have an activity like this and to also see it in this kind of space—hopefully people understand that art can also look this way.”

The morning of Saturday, March 10 has perfect Boil Down weather. It’s a clear, crisp 42-degree day, one of a few days of sunshine sandwiched between two nor’easters. I wake up readier than ever to see soft, slowly boiling viscous substances and to enrich myself with sweet, sweet knowledge about the region in which I now live.
The 15th Annual Maple Syrup Community Boil Down is a five-minute walk from Union Square and a 30-minute walk from campus. Groundwork Somerville, a local nonprofit, runs the Boil Down at the Somerville Community Growing Center, a quarter acre of green space “where community grows” that’s converted into a mini maple syrup expo on Saturday morning from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. I am serenaded with soft harmonica music and the sweet smell of boiling sugar as I walk up the Vidal Avenue hill to the Center.
The Center is neither super full nor super loud, and it’s welcoming—my hungry path to maple syrup enlightenment and New England assimilation, one informational table or activity station at a time, seems like the perfect decision. I’m here at the right time, too: February and March are prime maple syrup season, according to Jordan Penny, a volunteer with Groundwork Somerville. “Nothing else grows,” she adds.
I look around. The other Boil Down attendees are either 10 years younger or 10 years older than I am. I’d predicted this: It’s Saturday morning. But I am not fazed. I explore the Growing Center, trying to decide which station to visit first—I’m here to learn, after all.
Walking in further, I see arts and crafts—paper cutting, origami, mosaics–all featuring a vague maple tree motif. There’s also a maple syrup boiler in the back, a huge metal object that consists of a basin at the top and a space underneath for firewood. Penny narrates: “We’re pouring four-gallon buckets [of sap] in at a time, and it’s kind of melting down—it’s a slow evaporation process—and what’s left after a whole day of boiling is the sugars,” she says. “It takes 40 gallons of sap just to make one gallon of syrup.”
She offers me some sap, which has the consistency and taste of warm water with a only hint of sweetness—this sap still has a whole day of boiling before it’ll become maple syrup.
This year, Groundwork Somerville collected 150 gallons of sap from trees at Tufts University for teaching demonstrations, amounting to less than 4 gallons of syrup. I worry about the health of the trees losing so much liquid, but later learn drilling holes in these trees to drain out sap doesn’t hurt them. Josia V. DeChiara, Youth Education Coordinator at Groundwork Somerville, tells me, “You can just take a little bit every year for years and years, and the trees will still stay healthy. It’s amazing.”
Newfound maple syrup knowledge in hand, I now decide to venture to the hands-on portion of my visit. I visit a station where volunteers use a slice of a sugar maple trunk and a drill to show us how to drain out the sap. The demonstration slice is peppered with pre-existing drill holes, even on the top of the slice. I ask why: It turns out that the elementary school students enjoy operating the hand drill so much that they don’t want to stop drilling once they start. Eager kids line up behind me, waiting their turn.
I do not know how to drill a hole in a sugar maple trunk, but I still am not fazed. This, after all, is what I came to school in Boston to learn about: Flannel shirts! Maple leaves! Bad driving! This is real New England! The whole event is quintessential Massachusetts—even the the boiler in the Growing Center was made from scratch by Somerville high school students.
According to DeChiara, the children here—elementary school and high school students alike—know so much about maple syrup because many of them are graduates of Groundwork Somerville’s Maple Syrup Project. The nonprofit teaches a “maple syrup class” to students in Somerville public schools. “We recruit volunteers to go into all the second-grade classrooms to teach a series of four maple syrup lessons, which culminate in a field trip where all of the students are invited to come to the Somerville Growing Center,” DeChiara says. “We had 200 students yesterday and the other 200 or so will be here next week.”
Volunteer teachers, working with district requirements, lead four different lessons in different departments: math, science, history, English. “I was really impressed with their memory of the different parts of the tree,” Penny says.
Many Boil Down attendees have children in the Somerville public school system and found out about this event from school mailing lists. Attendee Richard Pattinson is here because of the Somerville High School newsletter. “I think it’s wonderful, these community events,” he says, his toddler son bouncing up and down next to him. Here, maple syrup education starts early. “I have a three-year old who’s obsessed with maple syrup,” attendee Emily G. Hickey says.
But maple syrup education is not only for elementary school students (and me). Groundwork Somerville hosts a Sap on Tap maple brunch that features maple beer. The growing season was so healthy this year that, according to the event description, Groundwork Somerville “had so much sap this year [they] decided to not just make maple syrup but beer too!”
By the time I leave the event, I feel like I’m still sticky with maple syrup. It’s not a bad feeling, to know that I drank half-boiled maple sap out of a Costco-sized sample cup while being serenaded by harmonicas. As a recent Boston transplant, I reflect, I couldn’t ask for anything better. Maybe someday, in my next three years of living in Cambridge, I’ll become a maple syrup connoisseur just like all of those Somerville Public Schools second graders. Maybe, as a senior, I’ll be spending the winters writing my thesis and sipping Tetra Maple brew. It started with this Boil Down. Will I ever be able to go back?
I keep tasting maple syrup as the 86 bus takes me back to campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 21, 2018 at 2:45 p.m.
When University President Drew G. Faust was appointed to her role more than a decade ago, the transition began immediately.
Faust, then the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, began acting as the University’s top decision-maker almost as soon as she became the president-elect. At the time, former University President Derek C. Bok was serving as interim president; he agreed to temporarily fill the post after Lawrence H. Summers resigned. Amid this presidential limbo, Faust sat in on deliberations during the spring of 2007 about the revised General Education program as a member of the Faculty and took the lead on searches for new administrators.
For President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, who was named Harvard’s 29th president in February, the transition will be slightly different. With Faust very much still at the helm of the University, fewer pressing agenda items necessitate Bacow’s direct decision-making. In an interview in February, Bacow said he plans to spend the months before he officially assumes office this summer in “sponge mode,” learning as much as possible about leading the nation’s oldest university.
Moreover, while Faust worked just across the street from Massachusetts Hall prior to her appointment, Bacow lives out of state—meaning he has more physical ground to cover during the transition.
“President-elect Bacow is living in a different state at the moment and coming in for bits and pieces of time and trying to use those bits of time efficiently,” Faust said. “So he’s less present than I was.”
Nonetheless, as a current member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—Bacow is already familiar with many aspects of the job.
“His knowledge of Harvard is going to enable him to start at a hundred miles an hour—not have to figure out what needs to be done over an extended period of time—so I think there will be enormous momentum from the very first day,” Faust said in an interview earlier this month.
Faust, who said she was “thrilled” about Bacow’s appointment, is now preparing to leave as Bacow learns the ropes. During one of his trips to Harvard this month, Bacow visited Massachusetts Hall to meet with administrators working under Faust. Faust, who did not attend the meeting, said Bacow expressed his excitement about working with the Mass. Hall staff.
In addition to learning more about the University’s inner workings, Bacow said he will step down from all his memberships on corporate boards to make more time to adjust to his new role. This marks a break from recent precedent; though Faust also stepped down from corporate board positions at the start of her presidency, she later joined the board of Staples, Inc. in 2012 and still serves in that role.
The presidential transition will likely bring administrative turnover once Faust leaves office. Bacow will quickly begin appointing administrators to help advance his own initiatives and fill recently vacated positions; in one example, he will need to find a new vice president for alumni affairs and development.
Faust has said, however, that she will continue the two dean searches currently underway for the Graduate School of Education and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. She said she will consult Bacow before selecting a final candidate.
When Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith stepped down on Monday, though, Faust passed the baton to Bacow—he will head the search for Smith’s replacement. Faust led the May 2007 search for Smith just six weeks before she assumed office.
In an email Monday, Faust encouraged Harvard affiliates to share thoughts on the future of FAS and the deanship specifically with the president-elect.
“He has asked me to underscore that he sees the search not only as a way to identify a new dean, but also as a timely opportunity to learn more from many of you about the hopes and views of faculty, students, staff, and alumni throughout the FAS,” Faust wrote.
Faust said she expects Bacow to reach out directly to Harvard affiliates soon.
Beyond administrative appointments, Faust has worked to connect Bacow with prominent alumni. At an event earlier this month, Faust said she introduced Bacow to members of the University’s capital campaign executive committee.
“Part of what I said in my remarks to the group as I thanked them was that the best gift they could give me was to support the new president with a commitment and enthusiasm with which they have supported me during my time,” Faust said.
Faust, who meets regularly with members of Congress about issues spanning from immigration reform to the new tax on university endowment returns, said she has asked lawmakers to keep up a working relationship with her office and to continue ongoing discussions about political issues of interest to the University with her successor.
Bacow will officially assume office July 1, and his inauguration will take place Oct. 5.

UPDATED: March 21, 2018 at 8:30 p.m.
Harvard College was recognized as a HEARTSafe Campus at an annual conference dedicated to emergency medical services last month.
February's designation came after CrimsonEMS—a student-run emergency medical services organization—worked for two years to expand and improve cardiac safety measures on campus. The National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation determined that Harvard has successfully reached the necessary 5 percent threshold of CPR-trained individuals on campus required to receive the designation. CrimsonEMS also worked to provide more accessible Automated External Defibrillators and public trainings.
According to their website, NCEMSF intends to “recognize quality campus based EMS organizations and their communities and hold them out as examples to other campuses as a means to improve overall cardiac arrest care.”
CrimsonEMS began working towards the HEARTSafe designation in the spring of 2016 after learning about it at a NCEMSF conference. Former Development Chief Sophia M. Emmons-Bell ’18 spearheaded the initiative.
By the fall of  2016, CrimsonEMS began hosting classes for clubs and organizations like HealthPals and the Freshman Outdoor Program.
Chief of CrimsonEMS Cynthia Y. Luo ’19 said the group has worked hard to expand their programming.
“We’ve been doing outreach initiatives including getting into ‘brain breaks’ for freshmen," Luo said. "We’ve tabled in the Science Center. We tried going into different Houses. We were just trying as many different ways to get that information out."
To be considered a HEARTSafe campus, EMS organizations have to inform and educate the public about best practices when it comes to being a first responder.
As it worked toward the designation, CrimsonEMS regularly conducted 10-minute hands-only compression sessions for the general public. While these sessions were not as extensive as the four-hour American Heart Association CPR Classes CrimsonEMS also offered, the shorter time span increased community engagement.
They led several of these 10-minute sessions during February’s Heart Health Awareness Month.
“We had families come by, parents really encouraging their kids. Seventy people came by and were excited to learn and demonstrate they talked to us,” Sienna R. Nielsen ’19, who does community outreach for the organization, said.
Over the span of two-and-a-half years, Crimson EMS was able to train 5 percent of the student body.
“It was kind of like little bits and little bits and this designation is kind of just a recognition of that accumulating over time,” Emmons-Bell said.
CrimsonEMS members said the group will continue to train more people, since they must renew their HEARTSafe designation every two years.
“We’re definitely not ramping down,” Emmons-Bell said. “On the logistical side, we need to maintain 5 percent of people but it’s cool that we can expand from this point onward.”

College students from around the world gathered in Vatican City last week to brainstorm technological solutions to contemporary social issues during a 36-hour “hackathon” organized by Harvard College and Business School students.
VHacks, which took place from March 8 to 11, was a joint-effort between Vatican officials, the Catholic think tank Optic, and students from the College, HBS, and MIT.
Cameron W. Akker ’18, the Chief Technology Officer of VHacks, said the hackathon sought to connect technologically talented students from around the world with the resources of the Catholic Church.
After arriving at the Vatican, the program sorted students into teams and assigned them to devise solutions addressing one of the conference’s three themes: social inclusion, interfaith dialogue, and migrants and refugees.
“There’s 1 billion Catholics in the world, so anything that the Church allows or accepts or endorses in some way has quite a broad impact,” Akker said. “Bringing together the technology of these smart young students with the age-old tradition of the Church, the mission was to see what the students can learn from the old institution of the Catholic Church and conversely, what the church can learn from this new wave of technology coming from these students.”
Between lectures, workshops, and ceremonies, the teams had a total of three days to work on their projects, which were then judged by a panel comprised of corporate sponsors and Vatican officials.  Duo Collegare, a platform that connects volunteers and organizations, won first prize in the Interfaith Dialogue category. Co.unity, a crowdfunded job board for the homeless, took the gold in Social Inclusion, while Credit/Ability, an application designed to allow refugees to build financial credibility, came out on top in the Migrants and Refugees category.
The winners for each theme received $2,000 and Microsoft MR Goggles for each team member.
Lynn Xie, a Business School student and the Chief Marketing Officer of VHacks, said hackathon organizers worked hard to include a diverse array of participants. Xie noted that students hailed from 28 different countries, including India, Brazil, and the United States.
Forty-five percent of participants were women, a feat which Xie said is hard to achieve in the “male-dominated field” of technology. Sixty-five percent of students also received corporate sponsorship to cover travel costs.
“We had around 60 universities represented,” Xie said. “We didn’t want this to be an event that was exclusive based on cost so we made sure that people of all socioeconomic backgrounds could attend. And all the major religions were also represented.”
Eric Eidelberg, a master’s student in computer science at the University of Calgary, worked with four other students from his school to create Duo Collegare. He said his team was inspired by a belief that “there’s too much dialogue and not enough doing” among different religious groups.
“The plan is to onboard multi-space religious, agnostic and cultural centers and promote people from different religions and cultures working together for a cause they care about,” Eidelberg said. “By going to a synagogue, a church, or mosque to get them all to work together-for the homeless, for animals in need, for helping recover from a natural crisis- we try to make religion a non-factor.”
Over the next couple of weeks, teams will submit presentations to the hackathon’s corporate partners such as Google and Salesforce, which—after revisions—will determine which projects to accept into the firms’ “incubation and acceleration programs,” Xie said.
“The prize money is meant to help these winning teams be able to leverage the funding to help bring these projects into life,” Xie said. “It’s not just about identifying the winners, it’s about how do you support them going forward."

The Undergraduate Council voted Monday to allocate $3,000 for bicycles and other means of transportation for certain low-income students on campus.
The legislation subsidizes the purchase of bicycles, scooters, and skateboards by undergraduate  students living in the Quad, the Dudley Co-Op, and off-campus housing.
To qualify for the $50-per-person subsidy, students must be eligible for the Student Events Fund, an initiative founded by the UC that provides event tickets to undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  Currently, about 25 to 30 percent of undergraduates are SEF-eligible, according to Eliot House Representative Arnav Agrawal ’20, a Crimson news comper.
Pforzheimer House Representative Rainbow Yeung ’19, an inactive Crimson blog editor who co-sponsored the transportation legislation, said multiple constituents had approached her about their inability to purchase bicycles. According to Yeung, the availability of a bicycle is more than just a convenience for many students.
“We believe that this can definitely positively impact a lot of students’ mental health,” she said.
Multiple Council members said they sympathized with the intent of the legislation but didn’t like the structure of the proposed system.
Dunster House Representative Victor Agbafe ’19 said he would rather the Council purchase the bikes upfront and then rent them to students on an annual basis, rather than subsidizing students’ purchases at local stores.
“That way we sort of take away the upfront costs and we make sure it stays within the community,” Agbafe said.
Currier House Representative Amanda N. Flores ’20 objected to Agbafe’s proposal, arguing that maintaining a collection of bikes would create a stigma around using one.
“I think that it makes it clear that, oh, here are the UC bikes for the students on financial aid,” Flores said.
Ultimately, the legislation passed the Council unanimously.
The UC also unanimously passed legislation Monday to allocate $6,000 from its $18,000 Emergency Fund to the Finance Committee’s student grant budget.
The Finance Committee, which gives out $300,000 in annual funding to recognized student groups, has grappled with a budget shortfall throughout this semester.  The committee was preparing to impose a 43 percent across-the-board cut in grants this week before Monday’s vote.
Finance Committee Chair Henry S. Atkins ’20 said the Committee’s financial woes run deep, and that committee members are “constantly” considering new ideas to shore up the budget.
“This in no way resolves the underlying structural issues that we are facing on FiComm,” Atkins said.  “More student organizations are applying for funds.”
Agbafe, who ultimately voted in favor of the legislation, urged the Council to consider the implications of drawing down the Emergency Fund.
“Does this qualify as an immediate emergency and would it impede us from possibly being able to take action on some sort of future emergency?” Agbafe asked.
Rules Committee Chair Wilfried J.K. Zibell ’21 pushed back, arguing the stakes were high enough to warrant the measure.
“Our main function on this Council is to help student groups,” Zibell said. “When our ability to do that is impeded, I think that qualifies as an emergency.”
Also at the meeting, the Council voted unanimously to fund Mental Health Matters Week, a UC initiative that will feature two petting zoos, massages, and other activities for students. The vote comes two weeks after the Council failed to pass a similar measure due to concerns that the program as designed was trivializing the issue of mental health.
The revised legislation calls for peer counseling group members to attend most events to “promote better access” to mental health resources, according to the legislation.

When Law School Professor Cass R. Sunstein found out on March 14 that he was this year’s recipient of the Holberg Prize, he said he was both surprised and gratified.
“It felt like squash had been made an Olympic sport, and I had been informed that I made the team,” Sunstein said. “Meaning, very surprising and slightly surreal—and a great honor.”
The Holberg Prize is a Norwegian award given annually to a researcher who has made great contributions to the arts and humanities, the social sciences, law, or theology. Sunstein is a researcher in behavioral science and political theory, and his work explores the intersection of the two fields.
The prize—established in 2003—comes with a financial award of 6 million Norwegian kroner, or around $765,000. Sunstein will accept the prize and the money in a ceremony at Norway’s University of Bergen on June 6.
Sunstein has published 48 books and hundreds of scholarly articles, including the New York Times bestseller “Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness.” The Holberg decision committee praised Sunstein’s range and depth, and called his research “wide-ranging, original, prolific, and highly influential.”
Sunstein said he believes he won for “work trying to deepen the foundations of democratic theory”—a major goal of his academic career.
In addition to Harvard, Sunstein has worked at the University of Chicago and was a member of President Barack Obama's review group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies in 2013.
Sunstein said there were many people that have aided him in his academic work.
“When anyone gets a prize, the number of teachers and students and collaborators and friends who are co-recipients is pretty high,” he said.
Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe, who taught Sunstein, wrote in an email that Sunstein “is a national treasure.”
“His breadth and depth of insight across disciplines is unparalleled, as is his productivity. That he credits me as his mentor is humbling but enormously gratifying,” he wrote.
Sunstein said he is currently working on a book addressing the #MeToo movement and how social norms affect people’s willingness to speak up.

Students flocked to Zambrero, a new burrito chain on Mt. Auburn St., to claim one of the 1,000 free burritos the store offered on its opening day Tuesday.
The fast-casual chain takes over a space formerly leased by the Boston-based burrito company Boloco, which left the storefront this summer after failing to attract enough customers. Boloco had occupied the storefront for almost two decades.
Zambrero has more than 170 locations in Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. The Harvard Square branch and a branch in Warwick, R.I.—which also opened Tuesday—are the store’s first two U.S. locations.
Zambrero boasts a model of “Plate 4 Plate” meals, in which the company donates one meal to a person in need for every meal bought at its stores.
“We wholeheartedly believe we can end world hunger in our lifetime, and expanding into larger markets, like the United States, increases our chances of making this a reality,” wrote Zambrero founder Sam Prince in a press release for the opening.
Zambrero General Manager Bianca Azzopardi attended the restaurant’s opening and talked with customers in a line down Mt. Auburn St.
Students said they were satisfied by the free burritos and the shop’s convenient location.
“This is the closest place to get food if you live in Adams, Quincy, and Lev,” Harriet Tieh ’19, a former Crimson Business editor, said.
Azzopardi said she thinks students will like Zambrero’s healthy take on Mexican fast-food as well as its humanitarian mission to help address world hunger, which  she referred to as the “two pillars of our brand.” She said she hopes the restaurant’s mission will help it attract customers who have a “health consciousness, and also that social consciousness.”
Students attending the restaurant’s opening, though, pointed to other factors that may or may not contribute to Zambrero’s success.
Eva S. DiIanni-Miller ’19 and Tieh said they liked the store’s social mission and atmosphere, but they said students also care about location, hours, and price.
DiIanni-Miller said the restaurant’s location and hours might help it attract customers, especially because it’s open until midnight, but she thinks Zambrero might have trouble competing with the many other options for Mexican food in the Square, including El Jefe’s, Felipe’s, and Chipotle.
“There are so many options in the Square so I don’t know if I’d choose it,” DiIanni-Miller said. “I think this is healthier and more expensive and Jefe’s is cheaper and tastier,” she added.

Faculty and researchers gathered to remember the life and work of renowned English theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking at a commemorative event hosted by Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative Tuesday.
Hawking, who died last Wednesday at the age of 76, is best known for his theoretical prediction that black holes are not completely “black” but in fact emit radiation, in addition to other breakthroughs towards unifying quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theory of general relativity. At the age of 21, Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—a rare motor neurone disease—and given a two-year life expectancy. While the disease gradually paralyzed him, Hawking defied doctors’ expectations, continuing his scientific career for decades.
Malcolm J. Perry, a math and theoretical physics professor at the University of Cambridge and Hawking’s former graduate student, was the event’s featured speaker. Perry shared his experiences working alongside Hawking and Harvard Physics professor Andrew E. Strominger to formulate a theory describing what happens to information when it enters a black hole.
In his remarks, Perry detailed Hawking’s professional career, beginning with his undergraduate studies at the University of Oxford. Perry recounted the legend of an ambitious, young Hawking giving an ultimatum to his embattled advisors: award him a first-class degree, in which case he would go to Cambridge for his graduate studies; give him a second-class degree, and he would remain at Oxford—ostensibly to the vexation of his teachers.
“They gave him a first [class degree], thereby making the worst mistake they’ve ever made,” Perry said, to laughter from the audience.
Before a backdrop of photos taken throughout Hawking’s life, which included Hawking with his Oxford boating club and with astronauts in a zero-gravity plane, Perry shared a litany of amusing anecdotes from Hawking’s career.
“While he was a great ambassador for science, he also wanted to do other things and live a full life,” Perry said. “The idea that he had motor neurone disease was not going to deter him from doing other things.”
Strominger emphasized Hawking’s commitment to his work during their collaborations.
“His most salient feature to me is just his passion for physics,” Strominger said. “I also have a passion for this subject, and when you have a shared passion like that with somebody, it creates a sort of bond.”
“To have a partner on that voyage to understand things—of course there were other people that I’ve also shared this with—but it was a special pleasure with Stephen,” he added.
Astronomy Department Chair and Black Hole Initiative Director Abraham “Avi” Loeb, who also spoke at Tuesday's event, remarked on Hawking’s scientific and personal legacies.
“He demonstrated the superiority of the mind over matter, in two ways. One, he was able to overcome the physical disability. But he also understood, at the deepest level, the secrets of nature,” Loeb said in an interview. “In terms of day-to-day life, he basically tried to ignore, as much as possible, his disability. And that’s quite remarkable.”
Loeb said he first met Hawking thirty years ago, when he was a graduate student at the Hebrew University in Israel. Many years later, he encountered Hawking again at an event hosted by the Royal Society in London, where he invited the theoretical physicist to inaugurate the Black Hole Initiative in April 2016.
Despite his fame, Hawking “never spoke as a celebrity” during his visit to Harvard, according to Loeb.
“He really was a very straightforward kind of person—sincere and truthful and willing to speak with anyone at a down-to-earth level,” Loeb said. “For example, after one of the events, he told his caretakers, ‘Why don’t we go to the bar at the hotel and have some drinks? We still have a little more time.’”
Strominger also recalled Hawking’s dynamic personality.
“He was also very mischievous. He was a lot of fun—he liked to surprise people, upset people, do things spontaneously,” Strominger said.
Loeb said Hawking’s work—despite his disability—reflected his larger attitude toward life.
“Black holes are supposed to trap everything—there is no way for anything to escape from a black hole in principle,” Loeb said. “But, in reality, he discovered that light can escape black holes, and they eventually evaporate. So even the ultimate prison is not really a prison.”

Randall White, an archaeologist and professor of anthropology at New York University, really digs his job.
“What other jobs could you have that people pay you to do this kind of stuff?” White said to a crowd gathered Tuesday at Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, when asked about the origins of his passion for archaeology.
Delivering this year’s Hallam L. Movius, Jr. Lecture entitled “Modern Humans’ Earliest Artwork and Music: New European Discoveries”, White shed light upon the “treasure trove” of early Aurignacian artwork excavated from French, German, and Romanian archeological sites. The Aurignacian artwork of Upper Paleolithic Europe is the earliest known art made by modern humans.
“In my whole career, I’ve never had the sensation I had when I turned over the block from Blanchard and saw an image that no one had seen for 37,000 years,” White said, referring to an Aurignacian excavation site in France. “How can you not like this job? Where else can you get that?”
White spent much of the lecture describing discoveries of “personal adornment,” early ornaments like pierced shells and teeth from a variety of animals, such as bears and horses. White lamented that some ornaments were found damaged and out of their original place because old excavation techniques often carelessly left them in the discarded dirt pile.
“I’ve had the very disagreeable experience of passing many, many field seasons walking on hundreds of stone artifacts left in the backdirt by these early excavators because they made very severe choices about what they kept,” White said. “For an archaeologist who’s really interested in context, it’s depressing to see what was destroyed.”
Concluding his lecture, White played an audio clip of experimental replicas of Aurignacian flutes.
“We don’t know what the music was like, but we certainly know what the sound qualities of the instruments were,” White said. “It adds a whole new dimension to our thinking of these 40,000 year-old Europeans.”
Jeffrey Quilter, director of the Peabody Museum, praised White for contributing an “outstanding” lecture to the Movius Lecture series, which he described as “one of the high points of our public programs.”
“It’s a special treat to have Dr. Movius’ son here,” Quilter said. “He has been very supportive of the museum in the past, and it’s great that he can share it. He was actually at some of these sites as a youth, so it adds an extra special dimension to the event.”
Geoffrey H. Movius ‘62, Movius’s son, said he enjoyed the talk, and said the lecture series in general serves as “an annual reminder” of his father’s life work.
“I thought it was a fascinating talk,” Movius said. “This is the largest crowd I’ve seen at one of these. I think my father, after whom this lecture is named, would have been fascinated with what Professor White had to say.”

UPDATED: March 21, 2018 at 2:50 p.m.
As the University prepares to hold a second student unionization election, organizers for Harvard’s major unionization advocacy group are ramping up outreach to eligible graduate and undergraduate voters to convince the students to vote “yes.”
The election is scheduled to take place April 18 and 19. At stake is whether qualifying graduate and undergraduate students may begin to collectively bargain with the University as members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.
The April vote follows more than a year of legal back-and-forth between union organizers and the University over the result of the first unionization election, held Nov. 2016. Around 3,000 students were eligible to vote in that election. The result—later ruled invalid by the National Labor Relations Board—showed more votes against unionization than in favor.
This year, organizers are determined to ensure the final tally goes their way—hence the upped efforts to reach students in the waning weeks before April 18.
Of more than 250 graduate students contacted by The Crimson, roughly 20 of 30 respondents said union organizers or supporters reached out to them in 2018.
But organizers may be focusing their efforts differently this time around. Two years ago, according to several Harvard affiliates, the union took a very public approach to reaching voters. For example, unionization advocates postered in locations all around campus.
“You would see lots of posters being put up across campus by the union,” Economics Ph.D. student Stephanie D. Cheng said.
Now, though, the union seems to be targeting its outreach efforts to specific Harvard departments. Graduate students from 15 of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’s 75 degree-granting programs said they are aware of departmental “get out the vote” groups in both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Cheng, Human and Evolutionary Biology Ph.D. student Mariel B. Young, and sociology Ph.D. student Mo Torres all said they think the union has shifted its outreach strategy to degpartment-specific communications.
English Ph.D. student and HGSU-UAW organizer Andrew B. Donnelly wrote in an email that the goal of focusing on departments is to encourage one-on-one conversations in advance of the election.
“We're trying to talk to as many people as possible, and the best way to do that is to have colleagues talking to colleagues,” Donnelly wrote.
Fellow HGSU-UAW organizer and Economics Ph.D. student Justin Bloesch agreed.
“We’ve been trying to make sure that the people who are having the conversations are in tune with the issues that are in their departments and affect the people around them,” Bloesch said.
Still, for some, the departmental focus signals a softer communications strategy. Cheng and Young both said they think outreach efforts this year are slightly quieter than in past years. Cheng said unionization advocates have been contacting her since 2015.
Torres wrote in an email he thinks more students have participated in outreach efforts this year than did in 2016.
“During the last election, I got the sense that the outreach efforts fell on the shoulders of a relatively small group of graduate student organizers. This time around, I have seen many, many more students involved in the GOTV campaign,” Torres wrote.
University officials are also working to encourage eligible voters to cast ballots come April. University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote an email to students Tuesday notifying them voter lists have been finalized and asking eligible students to read about issues surrounding unionization ahead of the election.
“As we move toward the election, it is critically important to consider the issues at stake and engage in a robust conversation about the potential impact of unionization,” Curran wrote.
Donnelly wrote in an email that, overall, the union organizers’ revamped voter outreach efforts address a perceived need for more dialogue between student workers.
“The lesson is more dialogue, more listening, more conversations,” Donnelly wrote.
In addition to their departmental efforts, the union plans to hold weekly information sessions and events between now and April 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of students cramming into classrooms during “shopping period,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in an interview earlier this month that FAS should consider reevaluating its class registration process.
Administrators and faculty have engaged in multiple discussions over the years about altering the way students sign up for classes, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rekindled the debate at a Faculty meeting earlier this month. Though there is no official proposal on the table, many faculty members spoke in favor of dropping shopping period, the week at the beginning of the semester during which students can walk in and out of classes before officially enrolling.
Before he became FAS dean—a role he recently announced he will soon give up—Smith taught CS50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.” He said he would start preparations for selecting and training teaching fellows in the semester before the class met and would hold two-week training sessions immediately before the semester started. If the number of students in the class would “sway tremendously,” though, he said he would have to go find more teaching fellows after the class had already started.
“That's what we're trying to avoid from a background in pedagogy as well as a background for students who don't know to the last minute what they're supposed to be prepared for,” Smith said. “And the teaching fellows, the graduate students, the undergraduates I had teaching my class all took it extremely seriously.”
In addition to teaching fellows, decisions concerning classroom locations and course materials are dependent on enrollment numbers, Smith said.
“All those decisions get condensed to shopping week,” he said.
Smith said improvements in technology mean that shopping period is no longer necessary for students to get information about classes. Currently, the course registration system includes the “Q-Guide,” which provides student evaluations on metrics like professor accessibility and the average amount of time students spent on the course. Many professors also upload syllabi and other course documents to Canvas, an online student portal, before the term starts.
“I think the world has changed. There's, as you heard at the meeting, many more ways for students to get information about classes than in the past,” Smith said. “Shopping week is a way of doing it, but we should be working to see if there are other alternative ways.”
Smith added that peer institutions could serve as a source of guidance when reevaluating the course registration system.
“We can probably also learn a lot from looking at our peer institutions and how they work registration, which ones might work for us and which ones might not work for us,” Smith said. “We should be asking those questions.”
Though Harvard is not alone in its “shopping week” system, a number of other peer universities require students to register for classes during the previous semester. Yale also has a shopping period, but students must indicate beforehand which courses they want to visit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School is launching a new fellowship aimed at students with a ‘strong commitment’ to Latino issues in honor of the late Lisa M. Quiroz ’83.
Quiroz, an alumnus of the College and the Business School, died on March 16 at 56 of pancreatic cancer. She served as Time Warner’s first diversity officer, according to a press statement released Tuesday. She also worked at Time Inc., heading both Time’s People en Español and Time for Kids publications.
Time Warner—a media conglomerate with subsidiaries like Time Inc., Warner Brothers, and CNN—will fund the fellowship.
According to the press release, Quiroz worked as a minority recruiter with the Admissions and Financial Aid office during her time at the college. Professor David R. Gergen, the director of the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, said as an executive at Time Warner, Quiroz was instrumental in having Time Warner sponsor two conferences at the Center about the “Latino future.”
“We had the great good fortune to discover Lisa several years ago and she fast became a wonderful partner for our Center,” Gergen said. “She worked tirelessly with us to strengthen the leadership development of Hispanic students and others devoted to that community.”
Quiroz had intended to join the Center for Public Leadership as a “Hauser Leader in Residence” next winter, according to Gergen.
Her plans changed after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that proved to be fatal, Gergen said. After her diagnosis, Time Warner asked how best to honor her, and she said she wanted to contribute this new fellowship to students at the Kennedy School.
The fellowship, housed at the Center for Public Leadership, will provide funding for students who have demonstrated an interest in reducing disparities in U.S. Latino and other underserved communities. The fellowship will cover tuition, fees, and living expenses for admitted applicants to master’s degree programs at HKS.
“This fellowship in Lisa's name represents a very sad but heartwarming story,” Gergen said. “Words hardly capture how much we are honored by our friendship with her and how much we will miss her.”

A handful of the high school students leading the #NeverAgain anti-gun violence movement now sweeping the country visited Harvard’s Institute of Politics Tuesday evening to push for gun reform and encourage greater civic engagement from America’s youth.
The panel, titled “#NEVERAGAIN: How Parkland Students are Changing the Conversation on Guns,” featured five survivors of the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. During the shooting, Parkland students hid in closets, texted their parents farewell, and listened as their friends met violent deaths at the hands of the shooter, who has since been indicted on 34 counts of premeditated murder and attempted murder.
Now, the survivors of the shooting are using their experiences to spur national awareness and action. The high schoolers’ stop at Harvard follows weeks of television appearances, interviews with national publications, and advocacy on Twitter—in many ways the signature platform of the students’ call to action.
At Harvard, the students did not shy away from describing the horrific events of Feb. 14 in unsparing detail. The speakers included current and former Parkland students Matthew Deitsch, Ryan Deitsch, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, Alex Wind, and Emma González, the 18-year-old who became the face of the #NeverAgain movement after giving a viral speech days after the shooting.
González opened the panel by calling for a moment of silence in recognition of a shooting at a Maryland high school that took place Tuesday morning. As of late Tuesday evening, the only casualty of that shooting was the shooter. Two students were injured.
“It’s important that we have these moments of silence to remember these individuals, but I think it’s just as important to speak up,” Hogg said Tuesday. “We have been silent for too long as a nation. We’ve allowed these things to continue for too long.”
Wind said he thought the shooting at his high school is no different than shootings that have torn apart lives in Orlando, Las Vegas, and other places across the country over the past several years.
Wind said the key difference this time around lies in the survivors’ response—and in their age.
“The difference here is that we are the ones that were locked inside the closets, texting our parents what could have been our final ‘I love you’s,’” Wind told the assembled crowd of roughly 200. “We were the ones that were sitting there praying that, when we heard knocks on our door and the glass shattered, that it wasn’t a shooter, that it was the police.”
“I don’t think this movement would be possible if we weren’t teenagers,” Wind added.
The students also spoke Tuesday about how the movement first came together. Kasky recalled that everything “started small” on his “living room floor.”
The survivors mainly wanted to prevent the Parkland shooting from becoming just one of “countless” incidents of gun violence around the country, Kasky said.
“I’ve seen this happen countless times,” Kasky said during the panel Tuesday. “What happens is we get two weeks in the news, we get a bundle of thoughts and prayers, everybody sends flowers, and then it’s over. And then people forget.”
“And I said, ‘What’s different this time? What can we do differently this time?’” he added.
The national phenomenon started in a public park. The students met up, ate pizza, and launched Emma’s now-famous Twitter account together, Beth González—Emma’s mother—said in an interview after the event.
Beth said many of the high schoolers initially chose not to tell their parents about their activism.
“They were creating this movement in a park with donated pizza. At no point was there any request for parental okay,” she said. “They were like, ‘I’m going to go change the law, and you think I need a permission slip?’”
The clandestine meeting in the park launched a digital snowball. Tuesday’s six panelists have racked up a collective nearly 2.1 million Twitter followers over the past month. (Emma’s account alone boasts over 1 million followers.) The students have communicated directly with politicians, fellow activists, and celebrities over social media.
The movement’s exponential growth has garnered the attention of politicians. On March 9, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed an array of gun limits into law, including legislation that raises the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21. The new law represents a dramatic change in direction for a governor who earned an “A+” rating from the National Rifle Association across his seven years in office to date.
The speakers said Tuesday they hope more high schools will begin offering civics programs to ensure students are prepared to speak out for what they believe. Ryan Deitsch said his government teacher, Jeffrey Foster, has been a source of great support.
“We learned about the NRA that day, Feb. 14,” Deitsch said during the event. “And now we’re going head to head with them.”
The students said they also hope to inspire a national cultural shift towards greater civic engagement. The high schoolers repeatedly urged eligible voters in the audience to exercise their civic rights.
“I was told today that the rate at which Harvard students vote at midterms is 24 percent, and I hope that this talk can somewhat inspire that to at least be the national average,” Matthew Deitsch said after the event. “I need the most intelligent people in the nation voting so we have more intelligent and just leaders.”
Abdelaziz N. Bahnasy ’21, who attended the event, said he was “inspired” by the Parkland students’ mission and focus.
“They came with a message, they came with a structure, and they came with an understanding of where they’re going to be in the future,” Bahnasy said. “That’s inspirational not only for me as a young person, but also for the community and the communities around the country that can move together.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, who introduced the panel, said the IOP plans to host Kyle Kashuv, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student who he said “has been actively supporting other legislative solutions,” at a later date.
This Saturday, the #NeverAgain movement’s planned “March for Our Lives” will kick off in cities across the nation, including Boston. The students on the panel encouraged attendees to participate.
“We’re expecting 2.5 million people marching worldwide, at least a million people in D.C. alone. Just the fact that all those people are standing in solidarity with us, and they’re unified with us, it’s absolutely incredible,” Wind said after the event. “It just shows that the people in this country are sick and tired of the normalcy of this mass shooting epidemic that we have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras will serve as faculty deans for Leverett House starting next year, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to students Wednesday.
Farrell and Ferrerras will take over from outgoing Faculty Deans Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi—affectionately known as “Chief” and “Coach”—who have held the position for 20 years.
Khurana wrote in the email announcement he thinks Farrell and Ferreras will be excellent faculty deans.
“Brian and Irina both bring to the role a deep commitment to education, research and community building that will make them a terrific addition to Leverett House and Harvard’s residential community,” he wrote.
The Georgis announced in late August they would step down from their positions as Leverett House Faculty Deans at the end of this semester.
In an emailed statement provided by spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman, Farrell and Ferreras wrote they are “absolutely thrilled” to be Leverett’s next Faculty Deans.
“We're excited to share our passions and we look forward to working closely with the students, tutors and staff,” the two wrote. “The Georgis’ shoes will be hard to fill, but we are ready and eager for the challenge and our communal adventure ahead!”
Farrell and Ferreras will bring to the job years of experience in the Harvard community. Farrell has been an OEB professor since 1995 and teaches “OEB 10: Foundations of Biological Diversity,” an introductory biology course offered in the fall. His field of study centers on the coevolution of insects and plants and, in particular, on the biology of beetles. Farrell also serves as the Curator of Entomology and Director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard.
Ferreras has served as a curatorial assistant in the Harvard University Herbaria for 20 years, where she studies orchids. She and Farrell offer a Summer School Study Abroad program in the Dominican Republic, where Ferreras was born and raised, and have led several Harvard Alumni Association trips to Latin America and Tanzania.
Farrell and Ferreras have a daughter who graduated from the College in 2016 and a son who was recently accepted into the Class of 2022.
In the email announcement sent by Khurana Wednesday morning, Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 wrote Leverett House would benefit from Farrell and Ferreras’s leadership.
“Leverett House will flourish under the leadership of Brian and Irina,” he wrote. “Their warmth, experience leading a summer school program in the Dominican Republic, and special interests involving music and the natural world make them ideally suited for these important roles.”
Farrell is an avid jazz drummer and both new faculty deans are “enthusiastic” about gardening and nature, Khurana wrote.
During the Georgis’ tenure as Leverett faculty deans, the two developed new signature House traditions, including serving “monkey bread” in the faculty dean residence and holding Wednesday’s Physics Night during Brain Break, the College’s late-night snack service.
Khurana wrote in the emailed announcement he is “so grateful” to the Georgis.
“Both have worked tirelessly to foster a close-knit and inclusive community in Leverett House, and we were so fortunate to have them as Faculty Deans for the past 20 years,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before Tuesday’s matchup at home against Boston University, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team had trailed in only one of its six previous contests. Even then, in that overtime loss to Holy Cross, the largest deficit the Crimson faced was a mere two goals.
All of that changed on Tuesday night, when Harvard found itself struggling to keep up with the Terriers’ high-powered offense. After Boston University attackman James Burr found the back of the net at the 7:06 mark of the fourth quarter, the Crimson trailed 18-12, by far its largest deficit of the season.
Harvard had threatened to come back twice already in the final frame, but the Terriers had responded both times. With the clock ticking down to zero, it looked as if the Crimson would suffer their second loss of the season.
Then Harvard scored six goals in the span of seven minutes, including the final one with just 0:48 remaining, to knot the score at 18 apiece. In sudden death overtime, the Crimson got the game-winner from senior attackman Morgan Cheek, completing one of the largest comebacks in program history.
With the dramatic win, Harvard (6-1, 1-0 Ivy) secured its best start to a season since 1990. Meanwhile, Boston University (4-5, 0-3 Patriot) suffered its third straight loss after a promising start to the year.
“I thought our team showed incredible heart, continuing to fight,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik said. “We were playing very poorly defensively, getting outplayed there at times, but we kept our composure, kept playing, and didn’t panic. Hats off to the players for their resiliency and effort, especially down the stretch.”
Several notable records fell during the high scoring affair, as match-winner Cheek broke the all-time program record for most points in a game with 13. His eight assists also tied the program record. As an attacking unit, Cheek combined with fellow senior Joe Lang and sophomore Kyle Anderson to tally 30 points all together, another program record.
“I’ve been struggling to get into a rhythm all season, seeing a lot of new things defenses are throwing at me,” Cheek said. “I hadn’t really had a game where I thought I played well yet, but today, I was able to hit some shots and also set up other guys for opportunities.”
As it turned out, the Crimson needed every single one of the points in its record-breaking haul. The Terriers attacking trio of Burr, Chris Gray, and Jack Wilson combined for 21 points themselves, nearly outscoring Harvard on their own up until halfway through the fourth quarter. Up to that point, Boston University had found creases left and right in the Crimson defense and capitalized with clinical finishes.
“We definitely struggled defensively, especially in our one-on-one matchups,” Wojcik said. “Their attack unit is very good at moving around, forcing us to rotate a lot and opening up space for good shots. It wasn’t until the fourth quarter, when we got possession a couple times in a row on face-offs, that we were able to stop the bleeding.”
Freshman faceoff specialist Steven Cuccurullo was instrumental in that fourth quarter stretch in which the team clawed back into the game, winning five crucial face-offs to keep the momentum on the home team’s side. His last face-off win gave the Crimson first crack in overtime, and it was a chance that the team did not squander.
Down the stretch Anderson played a key role, setting his career-high for goals with seven on the night. Between the 5:38 and 1:12 mark of the fourth quarter, he scored four straight to bring the score from 18-13 to 18-17. Anderson used a variety of maneuvers to finish, scoring around defenders and from tight angles to bring his team back into the game.
“It was a whirlwind of a game, and getting those goals down the stretch was a great feeling,” Anderson said. “Every guy on this team has an important role to play, and I was just glad I was able to contribute in my role.”

Midterms have effectively crushed your soul. Remember when you at least had spring break to look forward to? Now, your only reward is seeing how you score on this sad scale, because you gave up on scoring high on things that mattered ages ago. Tally up your points below to find out the extent to which you’ve given up on the semester:
You’ve stopped going to class (10 points)
It’s a given that lectures are all optional but, see, the problem is that you’ve also missed some sections here and there. Remember to save some of those unexcused absences for a reading period before reading period—you’ll need them even more desperately then!
Your sleeping/eating schedule is a mess (15 points)
You’ve been surviving on your roommate’s supply of dhall apples; that is, until someone says “Let’s go to Jefe’s” at midnight and you end up eating a three-course meal. Then it’s time to start that paper…
The MAC is no longer a presence in your life (20 points)
Unfortunately, your irreconcilable differences are too great to overcome.
You texted a random one-night stand from last semester a few days ago (25 points)
Okay, we can’t blame you for this one. How are you supposed to meet new people when it’s too cold to go outside and your best outfit is a pair of sweatpants with your freshman dorm t-shirt?
Every night somehow turns into “wine night” (30 points)
Don’t worry mom, I’m not an alcoholic, just a college kid enjoying the best years of my life!
YOUR RESULTS
10-25: You’re starting to go off the deep end, but you don’t elicit enough pity yet. No one wants to hear you complain about how “crazy” it is that that you slept in a few minutes this morning. Try harder.
30-70: We’re beginning to worry about your hygiene and erratic habits. Like, you probably go to Widener for the peace and quiet just so you can watch Netflix.
75-100: To anyone who met you last semester, you’re virtually unrecognizable. Same goes for your professors, because they’ve never met you. We don’t really know what to suggest at this point. Vitamin D pills?
