After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine looking at an eternal blue sky, open steppe with sheep and goats grazing on the grass, a few yurts scattered over an enormous land, and horses roaming freely. Then imagine a busy city with a monastery amongst a few modern skyscrapers, many historical buildings, and suffocating air pollution in the winter, caused by the burning of coal.
Both images come to me when I think of home. The breathtaking nature of the Mongolian countryside and the vibrant city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The summer before coming to Harvard, I tried to fill my head with as many images of my city and countryside as possible, relishing the warmest comfort I find in the place I grew up in. When the time came to board a plane to fly 6195 miles and say goodbye to everything I associate with home, I could not help but cry and dread the homesickness that would surely hit me once I left. But little did I know that this very homesickness could deter me from growing for the better when taken too far. Although the change was drastic and it was totally fine to take time to figure things out, I got too caught up in missing my previous home but not actually forming a new home at Harvard.
Cambridge, with its unpredictable weather and busy streets, and Harvard, with its intimidating reputation and limitless opportunities, were cold, uncomfortable, and daunting. Everything from the way people greeted each other to the level of awareness on societal issues like mental health was different. In the midst of all this strangeness, I craved comfort. Thoughts of home invaded my mind in the strangest moments. I would daydream of my beloved street in Ulaanbaatar while walking in the Yard and listen to Mongolian throat singing while doing laundry. Pangs of longing for my home on the other side of the world were persistent.
I am certain that many students at Harvard, especially freshmen, can relate to this feeling of homesickness, albeit in different forms and amounts. Most of us miss home, but at the same time, we all want to form our new home here at Harvard.
Throughout this ongoing period of homesickness, I’ve realized that although it is crucial to allow ourselves to miss home and take our time settling in, we must be self-aware enough to recognize when this homesickness is keeping us from functioning at our best. The balance is, of course, difficult to get right, but the line for me was when I was spending more time missing home than actually engaging with my surroundings.
Feelings of disconnection and loneliness led me to seek refuge in the place I grew up in. During those times, I closed myself unnecessarily, allowing the moments at Harvard to pass before me without being fully present. By living in an imaginary, idealized version of my distant home, I’ve become absentminded and detached from my activities here. Yearning to finish the semester and go home has prevented me from growing and fully immersing myself in the completely uncomfortable but rewarding place that is Harvard.
This realization has allowed me to become more proactive and find comfort in my daily life. Even though Harvard is unlike Ulaanbaatar, the Yard’s stunning colors in autumn absolutely captivate me and the tourists happily taking pictures fill my heart with warmth. I love Annenberg food and the familiar faces of staff and fellow freshmen, who make me look forward to dining hall meals. Although aches of loneliness creep in every now and then, coming back to Canaday and my roommates after a long day feels like returning to my safe haven at Harvard.
So I leave a note to myself and others who might be struggling with homesickness — allow yourself to feel the nostalgia of home, but also be conscious of the amount of energy put into dwelling too much on the familiar. I miss home, but I am trying to derive strength from my cherished home to be braver in my endeavors at Harvard.
After all, if our goal is to grow into better versions of ourselves during college, we must be willing to plunge into the uncomfortable and unknown. These days, I happily listen to Mongolian throat singing while walking to class, with renewed strength found in my background and excitement for all I will be learning at Harvard. I hope that next time I return to my lively city in the land of blue skies, I will also miss my new home — home amidst milder winter and warm people I have been lucky to encounter here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, Reihana Emami Arandi, a recent admittee of Harvard Divinity School’s Master of Theological Studies program, was deported from Boston Logan International Airport to her home country of Iran. Despite going through the long, tedious process of attaining a student visa, Arandi’s visa was revoked shortly after landing by Custom and Border Patrol officials, citing “immigrant intent.” She was issued an expedited removal order followed by an additional five-year ban from the United States.
This event is part of a recent trend of Iranian students with valid student visas being denied entry into the country. Just last month, Iranian student Shahab Dehghani was deported shortly after arriving at Logan Airport with a valid student visa. And there have been at least 13 cases since August of Iranian students being deported across the U.S. despite having valid student visas. While we acknowledge that we do not know the complete facts of this specific case at the moment, the increasing prevalence of such cases reflects a troubling pattern.
The impact of these deportations extends far beyond the individuals concerned. Each builds upon a climate of paranoia and fear for immigrants. The onslaught of these deportations, along with the Trump administration’s insistence on weaponized, anti-immigrant rhetoric and a deeply offensive travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries, nurture hostility toward immigrants in this country. We strongly condemn the Trump administration’s dangerous rhetoric and policies that have led to incidents such as Arandi’s. It is of the utmost importance that the U.S. — and particularly institutions of higher education — fully embrace and support immigrants in the name of secure, open cultural exchange.
We find these cases particularly concerning in light of the extensive background checks and increased screening of visa applicants carried out by U.S. immigration authorities. While the process of obtaining a student visa is arduous, applicants from the countries targeted by the original travel ban — including Iran — face even more stringent vetting and longer processing times. Moreover, according to a new State Department rule introduced last year, visa applicants from most countries are now required to disclose additional information, including social media profiles. For students with valid visas to be turned away at the airport after facing such comprehensive and invasive scrutiny seems inexplicable without the anti-immigrant program emanating from the White House.
It is important to note that these immigration policies have been met with strong opposition from Harvard’s administration. After an incoming Harvard freshman was denied entry into the U.S. and subsequently deported, the University worked with immigration authorities to resolve the issue, resulting in the student’s eventual arrival on campus.
We are grateful that Harvard has the institutional influence to support its international students and lobby for their immigration rights. Resources such as the Harvard International Office’s 24/7 emergency hotline for international students and scholars facing issues while attempting to enter the U.S. are crucial in helping protect the ability of international students to participate in the production of scholarship on campus.
President Bacow, who has written to administration officials and lawmakers with concerns about immigration policies, has been vocal in criticizing the unnecessary disruption, delays, and anxiety faced by international students during the immigration process. We commend his work in advocating for those affected by these policies, and urge him to continue that work — even more aggressively — to advocate for students with immigration issues beyond just in the cases of those accepted to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Atrocities tend to dominate our news cycle, the slow drip of horror sliding onto our screens. Newlyweds slaughtered in some faraway land. Koalas scorched to death by forest fires. Yet another kid drowned in the Mediterranean. Death, suffering, cruelty.
Sometimes these atrocities move us. We stare into a victim’s smile and wonder how they felt as the plane dove into the ground. We change our profile picture, or attack those who do so for being Western-centric, performative, and shallow. We send thoughts and prayers to those bullet-pierced backpacks. And then inevitably, reluctantly perhaps, we move on, knowing that there is very little we can do, knowing that we eventually have to retreat to our own daily lives and sit down for breakfast. Massacres and muffins.
But not all atrocities go away overnight.
According to estimates by the United Nations, roughly a million Uighur Muslims are currently incarcerated in an ever-growing network of “Vocational Education and Training Centers” in Xinjiang, China. The doublespeak phrasing hints at a fittingly Orwellian reality. From arrests determined by algorithms (no trial or charges needed) to constant surveillance of every corner of the locked dorms, the camps embody a concerning strain of 21st-century authoritarianism. According to reports from survivors, those inside face torture (fingernails pulled out, electric shocks), rape, sterilization, and forced abortions. Their only shot at leaving seems to be giving in, changing what the Communist Party deems “bad emotions” and “ideological contradictions,” eating pork in open defiance of their Muslim faith.
The horror is not confined to the camps, or even to Xinjiang itself. From intimidation and harassment beyond its national borders, to veiled threats against the many university students who returned from vacations abroad to find their families have vanished, the Chinese government has pursued a policy of aggressive silencing. A growing police state has come to dominate life in the region, with Uighurs forced through checkpoints that include facial scans and ID requests at mosques and parks. The collection and storage of DNA samples and the use of technology to track citizens’ actions and movements effectively renders even those outside the camps prisoners of the state.
To call the above the most pressing human rights crisis of our time, the biggest threat to fundamental human freedom and dignity, is more than warranted. Not that atrocities, as mentioned above, aren’t present elsewhere. Horror remains depressingly commonplace across the world. Just take a look at the United States’ immigration policies. Yet no other single nation’s actions remain as egregious as those perpetrated in Xinjiang; no other nation partakes in so many other comparatively concerning abuses; no other nation is actively exporting its own peculiar brand of terror, trying to teach its most dystopian repression tactics to fellow authoritarian regimes. China remains simply unparalleled.
The moral imperative for action appears self-evident; the specific course for it remains unclear. Opposing the world’s largest dictatorial regime is hardly straightforward, particularly when it lies an ocean away. There is, however, one promising lead: While our power as individuals might be limited, we all happen to be affiliated with a rather influential institution, one particularly revered across China that proudly champions “more just, fair, promising world.” A rare avenue for change.
Or perhaps not. Harvard’s ties to China appear to whitewash the atrocities of the Chinese government; our president too busy posing for propaganda outlets with President Xi Jinping and deeming his investment in higher education “admirable.” Indeed, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has gone out of his way to give undeserved institutional and academic validation to China, laughably stating that Peking University — where most students know nothing of the 1989 Tiananmen protests that rocked their campus, and faculty can be fired for holding “subversive” views — is devoted to “free thought.”
Worse still is the current framing of the Harvard China Fund, originally designed to promote the University’s presence in China. The fund currently packages a voyeuristic exploration of the regime into a fun summer trip — one dependent on universities that are increasingly cracking down on their own student bodies. One of its student testimonials describes Hong Kong, as seen at the peak of the protests last summer, as interesting for the study of “issues of freedom” but also of “security, and order,” briefly indulging in some politically reprehensible bothsidesism before diving into the more pressing matter of its delightful local cuisine. With some American universities cutting ties to their Chinese partners out of concern for the impact of authoritarianism on free academic pursuit, our institution appears determined to do the exact opposite.
Harvard is not known for taking brave moral stances. It was infamously one of the last schools to divest from South Africa during apartheid, and did so only partially; it has repeatedly refused calls to divest from fossil fuels and the private prison complex. Yet its attitude towards China — the silent abetting of a regime so outrageous in its actions, the willingness to use its influential brand to praise propagandistic institutions, the shoulder-rubbing with the chief executors of a humanitarian catastrophe — stands out as a particularly disgraceful stain on our history, a concerning disregard for basic human decency.

Harvard Medical School's faculty council plans to vote Wednesday on a resolution urging the University to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry.
The resolution calls on the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to eliminate “all direct investments and commingled assets” in fossil fuel companies. In addition, the resolution implores Medical School Dean George Q. Daley to “adopt this resolution on behalf of Harvard Medical School.”
Wednesday’s resolution, which is purely advisory, also requests the Medical School “declare a climate crisis” and endorse the U.S. Call to Action on Climate, Health, and Equity.
Medical School professor James M. “Jim” Recht — a member of Harvard Faculty for Divestment — said he hopes Daley will respond to the resolution by “publicly calling for that divestment to take place.”
The role of the 41-member Faculty Council advises the school’s dean in major policy decisions. Recently, the council created a sub-committee to address climate change, according to the sub-committee’s co-chair Caren G. Solomon ’84.
Solomon, an associate professor at the Medical School, said the major health problems associated with global climate change are why it is appropriate for Medical School faculty as well as physicians and scientists to weigh in.
“As physicians and scientists at the Medical School, we feel we have a responsibility to protect health,” Solomon said.
The resolution highlights the potential health consequences of climate change, including “heat-related illnesses, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, insect- and waterborne diseases, allergies, malnutrition, traumatic injuries, and mental health conditions.” It also argues the climate crisis has a detrimental impact on health care.
“The climate crisis is also causing disruptions to health care delivery - including damage to hospitals and clinics and interruptions in care and in the supply of equipment and medications needed for care by storms, flooding, and wildfires,” the resolution reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the resolution on behalf of the University and the Harvard Corporation. Medical School spokesperson Laura DeCoste declined to comment on behalf of the Medical School and Daley.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly last week in support of a similar resolution urging the Corporation to divest. Since the vote, roughly 500 additional faculty members from across the University have signed an open letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and members of the Harvard Corporation urging fossil fuel divestment, according to Harvard Faculty for Divestment’s website. The letter now has more than 1,000 signatures.
Solomon said the Medical School’s vote was not coordinated with the vote carried out by the FAS, but added that she thought it was useful to know what her colleagues were doing.
“I just thought their vote was fantastic because it made such a strong, important statement,” she said. “We hope to be able to do the same.”

Several of Harvard’s China-affiliated research programs and institutions have postponed or altered their operations due to the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
The virus — recently renamed COVID-19 — had infected over 42,000 people worldwide, and the death count had passed 1,000, as of Tuesday evening. Harvard has strongly discouraged travel to China, and the United States State Department also recommends Americans not travel to China due to the virus.
Several students who planned to study abroad in China during the spring semester have had those plans altered by the outbreak, Camila L. Nardozzi, director of the Office of International Education, wrote in an email to The Crimson on Tuesday.
“The students were given the option of changing their study abroad destinations for the semester, but all but one chose to instead come to campus and enroll in classes here, thus deferring their participation in term time study abroad in China to a later semester,” Nardozzi wrote.
Nardozzi added that though it is too early to know how the epidemic will affect summer programs, the Office of International Education is currently operating under the assumption that students will be able to study abroad in China over the summer.
Harvard’s China Health Partnership — a coalition of researchers focused on Chinese healthcare policy and practices — has delayed all conferences and teaching seminars scheduled for the spring and early summer until late June, professor and program director Winnie C. Yip said in an interview. In the meantime, researchers and collaborators will be working on “preparatory” work from home while also working to directly alleviate the outbreak’s impact on Chinese hospitals and help develop policy responses.
Yip said the outbreak has shifted some of HCHP’s future priorities: The partnership will now devote more time and resources to developing a comprehensive online healthcare platform for China.
“One of our research agendas is actually looking at the potential for an online platform for the healthcare industry in China. In fact, during this epidemic, that online platform is playing some very helpful role in easing the burden of hospitals. So that’s something that we will be spending even more time and resources on,” Yip said.
The Harvard Center Shanghai — which partners with Chinese scholars and universities to host conferences and support research — reopened Monday with its staff operating remotely, wrote Yi Wang, the center’s executive director for University programs. The delayed opening date came after the Shanghai government mandated that companies not reopen until Feb. 9.
The Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment’s operations have not been significantly affected, Chris P. Nielsen, the project’s executive director, wrote in an email. However, an upcoming visit to a field site near Beijing was postponed, and a planned workshop at Harvard this spring is also likely to be postponed, Nielson wrote wrote.
The Harvard-China Project has also delayed the announcement of a summer internship opportunity for Harvard College students in China, and may have to cancel the program, according to Nielsen.
The Harvard China Fund has postponed interviews for its Harvard China Student Internship Program to late February or early March, according to a statement on its website.
The Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies is closely monitoring developments in mainland China and is in contact with students currently in China who have received Fairbank Center funding, according to a statement on its website. The Center is still receiving summer funding requests, although final decisions will depend on the University’s travel recommendations as conditions change.

Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said in a Friday interview that he is planning to hire two new junior faculty members after engaging in a search that sought out job candidates specifically for their teaching, scholarship, and ability to strengthen “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” in the Sciences division.
The faculty search is one of several efforts recently undertaken by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to diversify its ranks and increase academic support for students, Stubbs said. In 2019, just five percent of tenured faculty in the Sciences division reported that they are underrepresented minorities, according to the University's most recent Faculty Development and Diversity report.
“Increasing the representational distribution across our faculty is a top priority, and above and beyond that, making sure that Harvard is a place where everyone comes to our campus is in a position to thrive – those are both top priorities for FAS and for our division,” Stubbs said Friday.
Stubbs also said he believes that cultural improvements within FAS — and specifically the Sciences division — will help to increase faculty diversity.
“I think, as we take steps to strengthen the climate and culture within our division, we’ll find that the demographic numbers change, and conversely, as our demographics shift, my expectation is that our culture will shift also,” Stubbs said. “They’re intimately related to each other in my opinion.”
Stubbs also said he thought recent remarks by John S. Wilson Jr., a senior adviser and strategist to Harvard’s president, served as only further reinforcement of Stubbs’s commitment to promoting a more welcome environment in the Sciences. Wilson cited the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. in calling for increased diversity across the University, according to Stubbs.
“He explicitly challenged us in the Sciences to continue to help this nation evolve from the path that Dr. King set out for us all, and that was an incredibly inspirational event by all accounts of people who attended,” Stubbs said.
Stubbs pointed to several methods that administrators have undertaken, including the University-wide Pulse Survey conducted last year, to better assess issues of inclusion and belonging on campus.
Over three quarters of Pulse Survey respondents reported that they feel that they belong at Harvard — but that figure was lower for certain demographic groups, including black and Latinx students.
Stubbs also noted that individual departments have conducted “very exhaustive” internal surveys to better focus their efforts.
“Other departments have in place ‘inclusion and belonging committees’ that are carrying out that work,” Stubbs said. “Other departments are thinking about putting together focus groups, and I’m encouraging each of our departments and units, through whatever mechanism they deem most appropriate, to undertake self-reflection leading to plans for action for the coming years.”
Stubbs said he believes addressing diversity, though, goes beyond just demographic data.
“The demographic results are a little biased by what question you ask,” Stubbs said. “I think layered on top of that is the importance of people who come here feeling like they’re included, and feel like they belong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted Monday to begin the process of renaming the city’s Agassiz neighborhood, named for 19th-century Harvard professor and proponent of scientific racism Louis Agassiz.
Agassiz neighborhood resident and Cambridge Rindge and Latin School senior Maya Counter put forth the motion at Monday’s City Council meeting, during which the Council passed it unanimously.
In her statement before the Council, Counter argued in favor of scrapping Agassiz’s name from the neighborhood, citing his scientific work that has informed white supremacist ideology.
“His views helped public policy and helped lawmakers support the continued oppression of black Americans, and I believe it is past time we recognize Agassiz’s legacy for what it was and that we no longer carry his name with the neighborhood,” she said.
The Council’s vote comes as part of a wider initiative examining Cambridge’s ties to slavery. In April 2019, the Council approved a policy order to compile a list of streets, schools, and public buildings named after people associated with the slave trade.
Monday’s meeting did not mark the first time Cambridge’s ties to Agassiz have come under scrutiny.
Tamara K. Lanier filed a lawsuit against Harvard in March 2019 claiming the rights to historic photographs allegedly commissioned by Agassiz — and currently owned by the University — that depict enslaved people who Lanier says are her ancestors. Agassiz used the photos as evidence to support his scientific argument for a theory of white superiority.
A group representing 43 descendants of Agassiz penned a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in June imploring him to turn over the photos to Lanier. The lawsuit remains pending.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons, who co-sponsored Monday’s policy order to rename the Agassiz neighborhood, applauded Counter for her efforts at the meeting.
“There’s so much more that we need to do to make these important corrections, because we do not want ourselves or our children or our grandchildren walking through the streets of someone so heinous and so disrespectful, for lack of a better way of putting it,” Simmons said.
Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 said Cambridge should account for its own history as elected officials throughout the country reckon with their cities’ complicated pasts.
“We often think when we talk, for instance, about confederate monuments that we don’t have a similar thing right here in Cambridge,” she said. “So it’s really important that we’re doing exactly this, which is addressing our own history in a positive way.”
The Council will now move forward with a formal process to rename the neighborhood.
At Monday’s meeting, Counter suggested renaming the neighborhood after Maria L. Baldwin, the first African American school principal in New England.
At Harvard, campus buildings, museums, and named professorships still bear the Agassiz name. Harvard faculty and staff, however, maintain that those titles pay homage to the contributions of his wife and son and not the scientist himself.

New concentrators in Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences celebrated their concentration declarations at the fourth annual SEAS Sophomore Convocation in the Science Center Tuesday evening.
Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III kicked off the convocation by welcoming attendees and sharing statistics about the SEAS Class of 2022. The incoming sophomore class of 367 students is the largest group to declare SEAS concentrations in the school’s history, Doyle said.
“Half of you picked Computer Science,” Doyle said, to chuckles from the audience.
Doyle also emphasized his commitment to diversity at SEAS in his remarks. Describing the current gender imbalance within the School — which comprises 38 percent women and 62 percent men — Doyle insisted that SEAS administrators are “not going to rest until we really reflect the College.”
Doyle also showed attendees video and photo previews of the new SEAS Complex in Allston, which is set to open for classes in fall 2020. He said the space is intended to be “not only a facility for all of SEAS, but also for all of Harvard.”
The landscaped courtyard behind the complex will be comparable in size to Harvard Yard, Doyle added.
“We have space for student clubs,” he said. “We never before had dedicated space for the offices of various student groups. We have garages for the car projects and robotics projects. We have a flying laboratory for drones, two and half stories tall. We have a makerspace.”
Later on in the event, three SEAS graduates — Kharma C. Foucher ’96, Michael A. Mancinelli ’15, and Trisha R. Paul ’13 — spoke on an alumni panel about their Harvard experiences and post-graduation careers.
Mancinelli urged students in the audience to “test hypotheses” and explore a wide variety of opportunities to discover their interests.
“Those internships or summer research experiences are a great way to kind of apply the scientific method and do some hypothesis testing — what type of industries are you interested in?” Mancinelli said. “Test the hypothesis and keep collecting data points and develop your passion.”
In a reception held after the panel, the concentrators spoke with representatives from various student organizations — including the Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club and Harvard Computer Society — and met fellow SEAS concentrators.
“Every time that Dean Doyle speaks, I get so excited about what the future of SEAS is,” Emmy Semprun ’22, who attended the reception, said. “Even showing us Allston and how much we have grown from when it started and we weren’t here.”
Semprun also said she appreciated the diversity of the alumni panel and enjoyed hearing about the experiences of women in engineering.
“My favorite thing also about this is there was a panel of three people and two of them were women, and they were women of color, which is incredible to see, especially as a girl in engineering,” she said. “Like, sometimes you kind of get lost in the crowd, so it’s always great.”
Spencer C. Rolland ’22, another newly declared SEAS concentrator, said he appreciated how the alumni panel offered insight into the connection between life as a Harvard undergraduate and life after graduation.
“Specifically for me, having the panel up there of the graduates and seeing what their story was through Harvard and then what their story was afterwards,” Rolland said. “It kind of just gives you hope to just continue on the path that you’re on and moving forward.”

Harvard Medical School student Andrew V. A. Foley is afraid of heights. Nevertheless, he once found himself on the top of a rock face in Western Massachusetts, helped up by his friend Mark B. Herzog.
Foley said he knew he was holding Herzog, an experienced climber, back from more difficult heights. But Herzog insisted on climbing as a pair.
“Eventually, he got me to the top to sit on this ledge with him,” Foley said. “He had made sandwiches so that we could sit there and eat lunch together.”
Herzog — who Foley described as “one of the happiest people” he has ever met — was a fifth-year graduate student enrolled in the joint M.D. and Masters of Public Policy program at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Kennedy School. Passionate about spending time outdoors and improving rural medical care, he died in late January at age 27.
He is survived by his mother, his father, his four brothers, his three sisters, two nephews, his girlfriend, his great aunt, and his friends and mentors at Harvard.
John Herzog, his brother, wrote in an email that Mark showed a deep devotion to improving rural primary care and a passion for climbing.
“His mind was always going with new thoughts about school, his research, and the future, but climbing allowed him to have complete focus on the task at hand and forget about everything else,” he wrote. “It gave him a chance to escape the urban life of North Carolina or Boston and find some wild areas. The physical aspect was also important to him as were the views and serenity that he seemed to find at the top of an excellent climb in a beautiful place.”
He added that his brother took advantage of opportunity where he could find it, making friends “both on and off the mountains.”
“Mark always took advantage of every opportunity and adventure he could find, but more importantly commanded an extraordinary ability to bring people together, encouraged others with his contagious humor, and cared deeply about their lives and stories,” he wrote.
After graduating magna cum laude from Duke University with a bachelors in public policy studies and with minors in biology and chemistry, Herzog began his studies at Harvard in 2015. He was both a Jerome H. Grossman Graduate Fellow and a National Health Service Corps scholar.
Despite his glowing resume, Herzog’s friends and family said he was more interested in connecting with people and working to improve healthcare in America than accumulating accolades.
David Liebers, who worked on a rural health policy project with Herzog, said Herzog was the type of person to bike for an hour just to catch up for 15 minutes with a close friend.
“He was incredibly talented at finding ways to reconnect and rebuild communities,” Liebers said. “Family and friends were his number one passion.”
Danika Barry, one of Herzog’s former housemates and friends in the joint M.D.-M.P.P. program, said he turned his own experiences growing up in rural Appalachia into a “driving passion” to improve rural healthcare.
“I think central to that was really to affirm the dignity of the people in rural areas, seeing that they had an absolute right to the best quality healthcare,” she said.
Hailing from the border of Tennessee and Virginia, Herzog sought to improve the health system in towns like his own. He worked on rural health research projects with the Rosebud Sioux reservation in South Dakota, the Navajo Nation in New Mexico, in the Appalachian region, as well as internationally in Guatemala, Kenya, and New Zealand.
While sorting through items Herzog left in storage, Barry said she found a book of haikus he wrote.
“Pause. Loosen the grip / Breathe, relax into the moves / Smile climb with joy,” one read, according to a website dedicated to his memory.
“It was a practice of reflection and gratitude,” Barry said of the poems. “Part of his impact is inspiring others to live more mindfully, more effectively and still find ways to access joy and gratitude no matter what.”
HMS Dean for Medical Education Edward M. Hundert wrote in an email that Herzog improved the lives of those who knew him.
“Mark was a shining light who elevated everyone around him — his classmates and friends, our faculty and staff, his patients, and everyone he met,” Hundert wrote. “His passion for improving rural health care was an inspiration — he was on a mission to make the world a better place, and we all owe it to his life and memory to follow his beautiful example.”
John Herzog wrote that he believes his brother would want people to remember him by following his example.
“I feel like the best way to truly remember Mark would be for people to live the way that he did - to spend the extra minute getting to know someone, to have an adventure whenever you can, and to value those around you at all times,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, finishing narrowly ahead of former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a former Harvard Law School professor, finished in fourth place with under 10 percent of the vote.
Sanders won the Granite State primary when he ran for president in 2016.
Government Professor Jon C. Rogowski, however, cautioned that Sanders is unlikely to gain much momentum from the victory given that he was expected to do well in New Hampshire.
“I think that Sanders has shown that he has built an operation that can put together a series of wins, but I don’t think that he gets any additional momentum from winning because this should be a state that he should win pretty easily,” Rogowski said.
Massachusetts residents will cast their ballots on March 3, as one of 14 states to vote on Super Tuesday.
Buttigieg — a former leader of Harvard’s Institute of Politics who served as the mayor of South Bend for eight years — came within a small margin of Sanders Tuesday. After a strong performance in the Iowa caucuses last week, Buttigieg surged in New Hampshire polls and surpassed former U.S. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Biden finished in fifth place on Tuesday.
“I think that you saw a very large percentage of those people that were making up their minds in the last week — or even the last couple days — were breaking in Buttigieg’s favor,” Rogowski said. “And that’s largely because of the very strong showing that he had out of Iowa, which puts him in a good position to expand his campaign network of operations to sort of take his pitch to a more national stage.”
Rogowski said Warren failed to sustain the support she garnered in New Hampshire earlier in the race.
“Not a good night at all for Elizabeth Warren,” he said. “I think it came down to in part that she peaked too early.”
U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) overperformed her polling average Tuesday and finished in third place behind Buttigieg.
U.S. Senator Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang both dropped out of the race Tuesday.
Harvard College Democrats for Andrew Yang President Michael Zhu ’22, who worked for the Yang campaign over winter break and canvassed for him in New Hampshire, said he was disappointed to see Yang drop out.
“I think he ran a very well-run campaign, did so many things right,” Zhu said. “Him — and even Evelyn Yang, his wife — are truly role models for Asian Americans like myself.
“I think that politics is not generally an area that Asian Americans are known to make strides in, but Andrew Yang really has moved that entire discussion,” Zhu added.
Rogowski, who was in New Hampshire for Tuesday’s primary, cautioned that the outcome of the Democratic nomination is “far from a foregone conclusion.”
“We’re all focused on New Hampshire at the moment, and we were all focused on Iowa a week ago,” he said. “But a lot of voters in South Carolina and places like Nevada and the Super Tuesday states haven’t really tuned in to the same degree yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s police union filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the University with the National Labor Relations Board Thursday, according to NLRB case records.
In an email obtained by The Crimson, union president Michael J. Allen alleged to members of the Harvard University Police Association on Monday afternoon that the Harvard University Police Department’s leadership violated the union’s contract by unilaterally cutting off officers’ access to a “daily roster” — a schedule that posts officers’ shifts.
“They are not entitled to change past practice at their leisure and we (eboard) will not allow them to do so, without sticking up for our collective bargained rights and past practice,” Allen wrote in his email to union members.
In his email, Allen also speculated that the department’s decision “could be retaliatory,” though he did not specify the impetus for the alleged retaliation.
Allen declined to comment for this article.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment late Tuesday night.
In recent months, HUPD has faced several controversies regarding its treatment of officers, who are members of the police union.
In October 2019, HUPD suspended black officer Josiah Christian after he engaged in a physical altercation with Thomas F. Karns, a white detective, who allegedly called Christian racial and homophobic slurs. At the time, union representatives and the department’s leadership sparred over the details of the incident, and ultimately, HUPA’s executive board condemned the department’s “egregious” decision to suspend Christian, according to a statement it released.
Last month, The Crimson published an investigation that found repeated instances of racism and sexism within HUPD over the past 28 years. In lawsuits, discrimination complaints, and interviews, current and former officers alleged that the department’s leadership disciplines employees differently based on their personal relationships with top department figures as well as retaliates against officers who speak out about the culture within HUPD.
Several days after the investigation, HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley announced in an email to department employees that he will launch a review into his department — the fourth formal assessment of HUPD during Riley’s reign as chief of Harvard’s police force.
Student activists called for Riley’s resignation at a rally Saturday.
In his email sent on Monday to HUPA members, Allen wrote he was disappointed Harvard failed to engage with the union to resolve their dispute, leading the union to seek recourse with the federal government.
“Maybe something could have been worked out collectively if we had said meeting(s),” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After bursting out to a commanding 2-0 lead over her opponent, No. 3 Trinity College’s Nanna Carleke, Harvard junior Hannah Craig fell just short in the third and fourth games. In the decisive fifth game, Craig responded with a dominating showing, overwhelming Carleke with an 11-2 victory to secure the seventh seed matchup for the Crimson. It was one of Harvard’s eight victories in its 8-1 romping of the Bantams on Feb. 5.
With her gutsy win against Carleke, Craig continued her dominance as a member of the Crimson—she has yet to drop a match in her three years on the Harvard squad. Co-captain Gina Kennedy bounced back from a first game loss to win her match, 3-1, at the first pairing and extend her personal win streak to 36. Senior Eleanore Evans rallied from 0-2 down to win the fifth-seed contest and her 11th victory of the season. At the second seed dual, Senior Amelia Henley steamrolled to a 3-0 victory to bring her win streak to 46 games.
According to Craig, although Trinity is one of the more challenging matchups for the Crimson, she was able to keep cool and execute her shots under pressure.
“[The match] definitely wasn’t easy at all,” Craig said. “It's always a privilege to play at Trinity and you never know what to expect especially because they produce such large crowds, and that can result in some other stress as well. So I think I came ready to compete. I had a very tough competitor and she put me under pressure. [But] I was somehow able to pull through.”
Harvard is undefeated over the last six years, having won all its matches since losing 4-5 to Trinity to close out its 2013-2014 campaign. Evans, who has been on the team each of the last four seasons, credits the squad’s incredible run of success to its unwavering work ethic and the leadership of its seniors.
“I think all four seniors do a really good job of exemplifying the attributes of putting in the work and seeing the result later,” said Evans. “We've all been on the team for four years now, we've won three national championships and we're going for a fourth—but it’s not without effort, and it's not without focus, and it's definitely not without cooperation. So I think that the good team unity that comes from the [senior class] really trickles down and affects the team at large.”
“Everyone's just been relishing the opportunity to play,” Craig added.
After its match against Trinity, Harvard closed out the week with a home tilt against No. 13 Brown and an away match against No.4 Yale. Continuing the fine form it displayed against Trinity, Harvard took the match against the Bears, 8-1, and swept the Bulldogs, 9-0. Going into the season’s final week, Harvard’s winning streak stands at 79 games.
With its win against Yale, Harvard secured at least a share of the Ivy League title for the sixth straight season. It has a chance to complete its sixth straight undefeated season this weekend when it travels to Cornell on Saturday to close out the season. The game will start at 12:00 p.m.

Whether this is your first year spending Valentine’s Day at college or you’re a Harvard Square budget shopping veteran, it can get tough thinking of new gift ideas for your SO on Cupid’s Day. So, when all hope seems lost, fear not! Keep reading for some fail-safe items to throw on to your CVS shopping list that are sure to touch your loved one’s heart.
Classic Chocolates, $1.99 to $15.99
You can never go wrong with a classic box of chocolates, as seen in this floor-to-ceiling wall display CVS always keeps stocked with goodies related to the latest holiday. Items include $1.99 single chocolate hearts, $4.49 Hershey chocolate hearts, $5.29 Lindor chocolates, and $6.99 mini Reese’s Cups. Some even include mini teddy bears, making for a perfect two-in-one gift!
Takis, $3.99
Spice up your Valentine’s Day with a *fuego* steal from the snack aisle. Snag a bag of Takis for $3.99 and play a rom-com to make for a cute night in with your boo. Warning: If you don’t attach a cute and punny love note saying something along the lines of “You fire up my heart” or “Taki dirty to me,” you are setting yourself up for failure this Valentine’s Day weekend. Trust us on this one.
Fun Socks, $3.99 each (3 for $10)
Have you ever wanted to try that matching couple outfit thing but didn’t know where to get started? Well, CVS has got you covered. Tucked away in the corner on the second floor is this beautiful stand of printed socks for $3.99 a pair, featuring sushi, avocado, cats, and Rosé puns galore. If you’re stocking up for a fun Galentine’s night in, these socks also come at a bargain price of 3 for $10.
Tide Pods, $7.29
Let’s be honest, nothing says “I love you” to a broke college student like “I got you this bag of Tide Pods.” Keep your Valentine’s Day gifts practical this year with a $7.29 bag of Tide Pods, something which even the pickiest of us are sure to appreciate and actually use. (Also, can we talk about the fact that the Tide Pods are on a shelf behind a literal locked plastic case? Unbelievable.)
Toastmaster, $18.29
Is this Toastmaster HSA approved? Who knows. However, for $18.29 apiece, why not start off your Valentine’s Day weekend on the wild side with this potentially felonious purchase? Grab one of these Toastmasters from the first floor home section and invest in many more dangerously home cooked breakfasts of Eggo waffles with your loved one.
Compact or Neck + Shoulder Shiatsu Massager, $79.99 to $89.99
If you’re really looking to splurge this Valentine’s season, you can get one of these Compact or Neck & Shoulder Shiatsu Massagers ranging from $79.99 to $89.99 on the second floor. While we aren’t too certain how good these are, that price range sure seems like you’re investing in what is likely to be the “best night of your life.” At the very least, you can make sure your SO is well-rested and knot-free as classes begin to pick up speed.
Who says being short on cash means you have to skimp on meaningful gifts for the ones you love this Valentine’s Day? Even if the Harvard Square CVS doesn’t do the trick for you, treating them to a Boardplus meal or providing a week’s worth of printing shows just as much love in a cost-effective way as a CVS splurge does. Happy shopping, lovebirds!
