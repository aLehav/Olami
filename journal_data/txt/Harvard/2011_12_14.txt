After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As if immigration reform hadn’t already stirred enough controversy, Alabama is persisting in its goal to tighten immigration restrictions, causing some to call this period of time a “new civil rights struggle.” These newly implemented and proposed immigration laws, though apparently aimed at lessening the influx of undocumented people, have now become more stringent than warranted. Though the federal appeals court has blocked some of the provisions that Alabama attempted to pass as part of their immigration law, more must be done to ensure that legal boundaries are not overstepped.
Alabama is among the new immigration-destination states, experiencing a 67 percent increase in its foreign-born population during the 2000’s. Due to this growing number of immigrants, it seems that the state is now searching for ways to cope with the shift in racial and ethnic representation. This shift has led to changes in the labor force and education system, which in turn have shaped the economy and the allocation of funds.
With Alabama school districts spending nearly $4 million dollars on remedial English courses, it is not difficult to see why some citizens are demanding more immigration regulations. However, this is no excuse to create laws that impose such rigid limitations.
Under Alabama’s law, state and local officials would have the power to check the citizenship status of students in the public school system and detain those who are suspected of being illegal. Through the 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling of Pyler v. Doe, all children, regardless of their citizenship status, are guaranteed the right to public education. Therefore, school students should not be subjected to such scrutiny in an educational setting.
Although state officials may claim that the provision isn’t aimed to deter students from attending school, it seems that the impact of the bill as a whole has trickled down to the education system. In recent days, school districts have noticed a significant drop in attendance among Hispanic students. Considering the significant existing educational gap between this ethnic group of students and their peers, it is imprudent for Alabama to continue pushing for these anti-immigration laws to govern the land.
As well as causing unnecessary disruptions within the education system, the Alabama immigration laws are also making waves in the low-wage work force. The state’s citizens argue about the injustices of immigrants occupying their jobs, but this erroneous mind set must be altered and set straight.
The truth is that many immigrants are responsible for contributing to the work forces that Americans wouldn’t normally involve themselves in, such as agricultural labor and other strenuous jobs that offer minimum pay. With the Alabama immigration law in full swing, many undocumented workers have reportedly fled their jobs in fear of being deported or harassed. What are employers then left with? A myriad of odd yet essential jobs that need to be filled. The reality is, these employers can’t bank on their American-born neighbors to fill these job openings.
If Alabama continues this trend of actively attempting to eliminate its immigrant population, the state must be prepared to compensate for the imminent drop in manual laborers. Not only are the immigration regulations pushing immigrants out of Alabama, they are also severely constraining the living conditions and mobility of undocumented citizens.
The immigration law also includes a provision that makes it a felony for  undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver’s or business license. Sure, these people may not be in the U.S. legally, but their legal status alone should not bar them from leading normal lives. People, undocumented or not, deserve the opportunity to be able to make a living for themselves and their families. By keeping illegal immigrants from obtaining a driver’s or business license, Alabama is putting even harsher limits on individuals who already have few opportunities to adequately provide for themselves and their families.
The citizens of Alabama may be concerned about how the increasing surge of immigrants will affect their lives, but supporting such strict anti-immigration laws is not the best solution. Infringing upon an undocumented student’s right to a public education is unacceptable and essentially forcing illegal immigrants out of jobs will only lead to gaps in the labor force. Alabama lawmakers must keep in mind what’s at stake for undocumented families as well as their own economy before continuing the enforcement of such strict immigration laws.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard education purports to teach its students the skills they need to make the world a better one. We are encouraged to think critically about social problems, to create our own innovative solutions to them, and, as a result of this education, to demonstrate the individual responsibility we each have to society.
But there is a dangerous disconnect between the principles that guide the University’s socially beneficial education and research, and those that inform the investment strategies of the Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard’s current $32 billion endowment.
We are writing on behalf of a coalition of groups and individuals in the Harvard community known collectively as Responsible Investment at Harvard, or “RI@Harvard,” that seeks to end that disconnect. We believe that a responsible University endowment is one that aligns with Harvard’s mission, “to encourage students...to assume responsibility for the consequences of personal actions [and] to advance knowledge, to promote understanding, and to serve society,” and not one that is governed by short-term profit-seeking and disregard for its social and environmental impacts. Moreover, we believe that the University endowment should adhere to principles of social responsibility, transparency, and accountability in addition to upholding its fiduciary responsibility
Together, we call on the University and the HMC to make the following changes to the school’s current investment strategy to bring it closer to these principles:
First, make a public commitment not to reinvest in HEI Hospitality, for its union-busting tactics and mistreatment of workers.  We commend the University for recognizing concerns from community members about its investment, but we urge the HMC to fully commit itself to not reinvesting in the fund until all of the problems are corrected.  Furthermore, the school should not make any capital commitments to Alpha Natural Resources for destroying mountains with mountaintop removal coal mining and Emergent Asset Management for grabbing land from smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.
Second, the University and the HMC should establish a social choice fund. This fund would give alumni an opportunity to direct investment of their donations to local community development financial institutions which provide responsible lending and financial services to under-served low and moderate-income communities in the greater Boston community. As Cambridge's largest employer, Harvard has the most direct impact—as well as economic and environmental linkages—in our local community.  As a result it is to this population that it is accountable. How better to demonstrate our responsibility to our community than through direct local investment
The HMC must integrate environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria in all asset classes of the endowment through the creation of a new responsible investment unit within HMC. This unit would identify opportunities for financially robust investments with a specific positive impact, incorporate these criteria into general investment decisions, engage on important issues with corporations, and,consider the negative and positive impacts of Harvard’s investment decisions. Detractors of responsible investing have long argued that while maximizing social good is admirable it is not worth sacrificing the maximum possible return on investment. Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that integrating environmental, social, and governance criteria does not negatively impact return on investment and actually leads to a more complete understanding of material issues, thereby lowering risk and possibly increasing returns over the long term.
As part of this avowed commitment to accountability, the Harvard Corporation should modernize the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility to make them more transparent and accountable. Specifically, it should expand the mandate of the Committees beyond proxy voting on directly-held investments to include evaluating and acting on the concerns of Harvard community members surrounding holdings and reporting to the community on the success of HMC’s responsible investments. The University's investment decisions cannot occur in a “black box,” removed from the input and examination of Harvard community members.
Finally, Harvard must promote transparency and accountability in the Harvard endowment by annually disclosing investment holdings, the asset values of individual investments, the identity of outside managers and their fee arrangements, as well as HMC compensation arrangements. Annual disclosure would allow the HMC to continue to capitalize on its proprietary strategies, while still allowing Harvard community stakeholders to make sure that it is making good on its promise of responsible investments.
First and foremost, we are dedicated to the responsible investment of Harvard’s endowment. In the coming months, RI@Harvard will release a series of papers further explaining our positions to the Corporation and the broader community. We are committed to an action-oriented campaign rooted in a nuanced understanding of the policies we support. While we first aim to work with University and HMC leadership to accomplish our goals, we are prepared to escalate our tactics if our voices are not taken seriously
As we launch our effort to build a broad coalition of students, alumni, faculty, and other allies to work for the implementation of the above proposals, we invite you to join us. Become a signatory of our statement of principles by visiting join.responsibleharvard.com.
Harvard’s money matters, and together, we will change the way Harvard invests it, for a better future for all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At last Wednesday’s faculty meeting Professor Susan Suleiman, acting chair of the department of Romance Languages and Literatures, said that as an educational institution Harvard should use its position to make a statement against social inequalities. Suleiman, like many others supportive of the Occupy Harvard movement, believes that social inequality is an important issue to address in today’s society—and we agree. However, asking the University to issue statements about issues as broad as social inequality detracts from its educational mission. Harvard should, and does, speak out about and lobby on behalf of issues that directly affect students and on various policies that affect it directly, but when it comes to making broader political statements we must remember that Harvard is a university, not a think tank.
As an educational institution, Harvard has a responsibility first and foremost to promote free discourse. While there are certainly instances when limits must be imposed, it is not our place to stifle discourse about contemporary political issues by taking broad stances on issues such as inequality. If Harvard bows to Suleiman’s demands and issues a statement condemning social inequality in all its forms, who is to say that they should not also endorse a presidential candidate, or impose a political litmus test for faculty.
To be sure, there are some instances in which Harvard’s political involvement is necessary and proper. Our lobbyists in Washington have knocked on doors for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, and we have used our high visibility to advocate for the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy and greater freedoms concerning scientific research. In each of those cases, however, the advocacy has been directly tied to Harvard’s mission as an educational institution, whether in ensuring access for all students, upholding our non-discrimination policy, or advocating in favor of the unhindered pursuit of knowledge. We must be careful to not overstep our boundaries and shift from being an educational institution to an advocacy organization.
To be sure, there are ways that Harvard can continue and expand its commitment to greater social equality without trips to Washington. As an institution, Harvard should promote greater social responsibility by encouraging an ethic of public service among its students and provide those students with more opportunities and information about careers in that field. In the case of fixing social inequality, as with many other issues, Harvard should lead with actions, not with political statements.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Occupy Harvard prepares to weather the winter in Harvard Yard, the rest of us —with the possible exception of Primal Screamers thankful for the temporary ban on tourists —secretly hope that the cold will drive them out. Over the past several months, the tent city has expanded although the numbers of occupiers seem to have dwindled, their tactics have grown more disruptive, and I—once genuinely curious about the potential effects of the Occupy Harvard movement—have grown more and more eager for its exit.
To be sure, I agree with many of their demands—a living wage for employees, socially responsible and transparent investments, and increased diversity among the faculty to name a few—and I know and like many of the undergraduate Occupiers personally. But as a liberal, every time I am told that someone is ‘surprised’ that I am not occupying the yard myself I feel an easily explicable surge of anger.
In her op-ed for the Crimson, Lucy O’Leary ’12 argues that the ‘minor inconvenience’ of shutting down the Yard is nothing compared to the gains Harvard janitors won–as she puts it, through Occupy Harvard’s presence. It’s a rather presumptuous statement for these students to make, and completely invalidates the hard work Harvard’s employee unions actually did to accomplish this change. She references Alexandra Petri’s joke about janitors earning $300,000 a year—near the top 1 percent, O’Leary declares—as proof of ignorance about the occupy movement. Petri was clearly being facetious, but let’s face it—Occupy Harvard knows it’s not the dual-earner family making $300,000 a year that’s causing mass inequality. It’s the 0.1 percent and the .01 percent, whose net worth increases exponentially from even the 1 percent. But that doesn’t make for a catchy slogan.
Instead, Occupy Harvard focuses on a very narrow base of support to grow its movement. With actions such as picketing and attempting to interrupt a Goldman Sachs recruiting session—the attendees of which will probably go on to be in the 1 percent, but almost certainly not the .01 percent—Occupy alienated a large portion of the student body that might have been persuaded to be sympathetic to their causes. No social movement was ever built on a narrow base: women led the charge for women’s suffrage, but they needed male allies; gay activists picketed the streets, but heterosexual allies were essential to social and political change. Likewise, future Goldman Sachs employees of America can care deeply about labor rights and socially just investments while also wanting a cushy paycheck. Yet they’re not likely to line up behind the Occupy banner when Occupy Harvard’s disruptions result in cancelled information sessions and jeopardize their opportunities to find jobs.
A friend who recently began work at a top management consulting firm occupied Wall Street the week before starting work, because he, like other Harvard students who choose to go into consulting or finance after graduation, are well aware of the flaws in the system. For others going into those fields, it’s a chance to access privilege they had never been privy to before, and many intend to use their paychecks for social justice. Certainly, Goldman is a worthy target of the Occupy movement more broadly, but picketing an information session run largely by young professionals just a year or two out of Harvard achieves little other than alienating potential allies. For Occupy Harvard, there is a “with us or against us” mentality, and there is no middle ground to work with students who they may agree with on some issues and have disagreements with on others.
The downside of this is that the sheer self-righteousness of many of the occupiers renders an alternate version of events inconceivable. In her recent op-ed, Sandra Korn and fellow occupiers dismissed the University’s concerns for student safety—most shockingly the University’s statements about concerns over sexual assault—as illegitimate. “You make reference to incidents of sexual assault at other Occupy sites, which are abhorrent. However, we invite you to compare the number of such incidents with that of sexual assaults occurring, for example, on Harvard’s campus and in final clubs,” they wrote. Apparently to the Occupiers, the fact that sexual assaults occur—an unfortunate but inevitable reality—invalidates the University’s attempt to prevent more such incidents from occurring, especially in a space populated exclusively by our most vulnerable population, first-year students.
Similarly, this leads to a single point of view on what Occupy has dubbed “180:1”—the ratio between the salaries of the highest paid employees of the Harvard Corporation and the lowest paid employees at the University, the custodial staff. Among the other disparity issues Korn cites in her op-ed on is Drew Faust’s salary, coming in at $875,000. To be sure, I am not excusing or supporting a $8.4 million paycheck for the HMC’s Stephen Blyth, especially while others don’t make a living wage, but Occupy is vehemently opposed to even smaller wage differences. Faust’s salary is not incongruent with those of other Ivy League presidents. In fact, it is about half of that made by Yale’s president. It is rather clear that Occupy’s goals are about inciting antagonism towards the University rather than providing those comparative facts. Similarly, Korn fails to mention that Yale’s chief investors do make less, while that’s because Yale outsources much of the work that Harvard’s investors perform in-house, resulting in smaller amounts paid out to a larger group of people. I would love someone to invest on our behalf pro-bono or at a lower wage, but if we’re talking about numbers let’s provide accurate comparisons rather than alienating Drew Faust over her sizeable, but well within the norm, salary.
As O’Leary claims, complaining over the lockdown of the yard trivializes the issue. Americans are angry, and they well should be, but Occupy Harvard has little to do with the Occupy movement more broadly. Rather, the students occupying Harvard Yard are doing more to set back the causes they claim to champion in the long run than they are to advance them, and that is not a trivial issue. A survey of over 1000 undergraduates performed by Stats 104 students found that Occupy Harvard was viewed favorably by only 2.84 out of 10 students, surely much lower than student support for the individual issues they’re pushing for and much lower than Harvard’s support for the Occupy movement nationally. The Occupy Harvard message isn’t working, and the movement is a coalition of a 0.1 percent. They would do well to tone down the rhetoric, tear down the tents, and try to bring more students in for a truly strong student movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Carl Zimmer, popular science writer and a lecturer at Yale, gave a presentation at the Museum of Natural History Tuesday night on his new book “Science Ink: Tattoos of the Science Obsessed.”
The talk focused on the colorful subculture of science-themed body art and how researchers in every field, from archaeology to biochemistry, use tattoos to capture what they love about their discipline.
“In a weird, unexpected way, tattoos are a good way of illustrating the deep passion that scientists have for their subject,” said Zimmer.
The talk used slides to showcase an eclectic mix of tattoos, ranging from the highly technical to the fantastical.
Zimmer began by showing off a seemingly simple tattoo of a DNA helix belonging to Harvard Medical School neurobiologist Sandeep “Robert” Datta before revealing that its nucleotide structure spelled out Datta’s wife’s initials.
“Some people think of tattoos as a thing that you get when you’re young, drunk, or both,” Zimmer said. “But these scientists have put a lot of knowledge and personal connections into theirs.”
Next on display was a woman covered from shoulder to shoulder in gigantic insects: moths, beetles, and ants, in tribute to her field of entomology.
Chemistry tattoos were also represented, most notably by a woman with the structure of serotonin—the “pleasure” molecule believed to cause happiness—on her lower thigh.
“It’s weird at first when your in-box starts getting filled with pictures of partially disrobed scientists,” said Zimmer, earning laughter from the audience of about 200.
The talk also delved into the history behind modern science tattoos. Zimmer explained how Sir Joseph Banks, an English botanist, learned of tattoos from the people of New Zealand and Tahiti during a voyage in the late 18th century. Zimmer drew parallels between Maori tribesmen with full-face tattoos and scientists who fill their entire back with complex algebraic equations, as well as discussing the powers that tattoos were thought to hold in the past.
“Sailors believed that if they had a tattoo of an anchor on their arm, it would save them from drowning,” said Zimmer.
Even Ötzi the Iceman, the famous 5,400-year-old mummy found preserved in the Austrian Alps, was found to have some crude tattoos on his body.
By way of more modern implications, Zimmer talked about how people use tattoos as a means of expressing their belief in science in the face of oppression. For example, Busra D. Ozpolat, a modern-day Turkish biologist, bears a tattoo of Charles Darwin’s famous finches, whose differentiated beaks helped inspire him to develop his theory of evolution. This holds “a lot of profound meaning,” said Zimmer, as Turkey’s creationist leanings have made it difficult for scientists to teach evolution there. According to the Washington Post, fewer than 25 percent of Turks believe in evolution, the lowest percentage in any developed nation.
Aimee Gillespie, a graduate student at MIT studying geochemistry, said she “never knew how many of my fellow scientists [had] tattoos,” adding that if she were to get a tattoo, it would be of the Keeling Curve—a measure of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere.

Students will participate in activities ranging from artistic projects to pre-professional development during this year’s Wintersession, which will last from Jan. 13 to Jan. 22.
This year, all students will be allowed to return to campus for Wintersession, a longer, revamped version of last year’s Optional Winter Activities Week.
“We heard about [Wintersession], and it seemed like a good way to get people involved in spoken word,” said Kyra A. Atekwana ’14, the co-president of Speak Out Loud, a spoken word group on campus.
Atekwana’s organization will be conducting a week-long workshop featuring guest performances by local poets. Participants of the Speak Out Loud workshop will present their work in a showcase at the end of the week.
“It’s low-key and it’s meant to be a way to relax and do something without the pressure of so many classes,” Atekwana said.
Respectably French!, a sketch comedy group, is also hosting a workshop for students staying on campus during Wintersession.
During the session, members and non-members will learn about the production of short sketches.
“Having the free time and resources of Wintersession lets us shift around and learn more about different aspects of production,” Mary C. Hallowell ’14, a member of Respectably French!, wrote in an email.
Other events include a week-long yoga retreat in Adams House, a bronze-sculpting workshop sponsored by the Harvard Art Museums, and recreational activities such as snow sculpting and rock climbing sessions hosted by Harvard Athletics and the Center for Wellness.
A slew of career-oriented activities will be offered as well. The Harvard Alumni Undergraduate Connection will be hosting a conference about networking, and the Harvard College Leadership Working Group will be conducting a two-day program about leadership development.
Many Wintersession workshops are student-run and funded by the Undergraduate Council, which has spent about $20,000 on over 30 programs, The Crimson reported in November.
The Office of Career Services will be conducting a research proposal writing seminar, and the Freshman Dean’s Office will hold a winter culinary class.
Despite the variety of offerings from both student groups and College offices, some students do not plan to participate in these activities.
Mihir J. Chaudhary ’12 said that he, like many other seniors, will be returning to campus early to work on his thesis. Meanwhile, some athletes will begin training for the spring season.
“I wouldn’t mind spending 10 days doing absolutely nothing,” said Kevin G. Sun ’15, who says he will be coming back to campus early anyway.
“Wintersession is a week on campus with access to the same incredible people and resources as during the semester but without the pressure and stress,” said Miriam R. Farkas ’14 in an email. Farkas will be hosting a four-day experimental cooking class to teach students a set of college “survival recipes.”

Workers at the Harvard Club of Boston lodged a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board last week alleging that the Club threatened workers to prevent them from participating in union activities and illegally surveilled workers participating in such activities.
The Club and its workers are currently involved in another lawsuit, in which workers are claiming that the Club violated the Massachusetts “Tip Law” by charging service charges that the management then failed to distribute to workers. In the midst of these two lawsuits, the Harvard Club of Boston is also in contract negotiations with UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents Harvard Club of Boston workers and Harvard University dining hall workers.
The Harvard Club of Boston is a private business open to Harvard graduates as well as graduates of “selected affiliate colleges and universities,” according to its website. The Club is not associated with Harvard University. Representatives of the Club declined to comment for this article.
Harvard Club workers and union organizers allege that the illegal threatening and surveillance occurred when workers organized a leafletting campaign in which Club workers and union members handed out flyers promoting member and community support for a fair contract negotiation. Club management reportedly issued “threats of reprisals and coercion against bargaining unit members for engaging in protected concerted activity,” according to the official complaint issued by workers. The complaint further claims that the management called the police, told some workers that they were not allowed to go outside, and “overtly repeatedly photograph[ed] bargaining unit members engaged in protected concerted activity.”
One Harvard Club worker, who identified herself as Susanna, said that her manager told her that she was not permitted to go outside and participate in union activity, even on her break.
“My manager told me that I was not allowed to leave and that they were going to call the police,” Susanna said.
Susanna’s co-worker, who identified herself as Norma, said that she felt the Club was holding the workers inside in order to intimidate them.
“They wanted to show that they had all the power, not us,” Norma said. “They were using intimidation to make us believe that we were powerless.”
Union members and workers said they hope the new lawsuit will help make sure that workers are not pressured by their managers. According to Dana Simon, a representative for Local 26, the union is focused on ensuring that the Club does not use “intimidation” to prevent workers from lawfully pursuing their right to a fair contract.
“More than just being illegal, this was just a rotten, unacceptable way to treat decent, hard-working people,” Simon said.  “Management just has to bargain in good faith—they can’t just push that away.”
According to Simon, a “just” contract consists of increased salaries, better health care policies, and maintaining the current number of vacation days.
“Management is proposing no wage increases for six years and, out of 240 workers, less than 90 have health care,” he said. “We are really serious about trying to negotiate a contract that will enable our members to lead full lives.”`

Lowell Lecture Hall was closed starting Monday as a precautionary measure to evaluate several ornamental fixtures that appear to be separating from the ceiling.
Prior to the hall’s closing, students enrolled in Music 1a, Music 2, Government 20, Molecular and Cellular Biology 80, and Japanese History 146: “Kyoto: The Capital of Medieval Japan” were instructed to attend their course meetings in alternate locations.
During a recent routine inspection, Raymond C. Traietti, assistant director of the Memorial Hall and Lowell Hall Complex, said that contractors found unexpected separations in the plaster of the ornamental fixtures. He added that there may be no risk posed by the separation, but that they are being investigated “just to be safe.”
“We can’t see what’s behind there now,” Traietti said. “I think once we cut in, we’ll see what’s going on. [The apparent separation] may turn out to be nothing.”
Lowell Lecture Hall was closed Dec. 1 and Dec. 2 to build scaffolding and cribbing in preparation for repairs. Classes and rehearsals continued to take place in the hall until Monday.
Engineers and contractors will evaluate the separation of the ornamental fixtures and recommend a plan of action if needed.
Professor Joshua R. Sanes, who teaches MCB 80, said in an e-mail that he was glad that there was only one lecture left when the problem arose.His final lecture was moved to Sanders Theatre and he said that the change in location had no major effect on his course.
Traietti said that the repairs will ideally be completed in mid-January because the floor must be ready to accommodate class meetings and rehearsals by Jan. 23.
According to the Office for the Arts’ website, the building was designed in 1902 by Boston architect Guy Lowell, Class of 1892.
Lowell Lecture Hall was renovated in 1994, after being unoccupied for 20 years and sustaining severe water damage. Traietti said that the engineers and contractors currently evaluating the separation of ornamental fixtures have consulted with the workers that were involved in the previous renovations.
Traietti said that, despite any structural deficiencies, he continues to appreciate the building’s legacy.
“It’s a wonderful building,” Traietti said. “It’s one of my favorite buildings on campus. It just keeps soldiering on. We’re really lucky to have it.”

An educator, mentor, and “one of the most creative minds of football,” Joseph Restic, the former Harvard football coach who led the Crimson to five Ivy League championships, will be remembered for his humble demeanor and cerebral approach to the game.
Restic, who went 117-97-6 during his 23-year tenure at Harvard—the longest-ever by a Crimson coach—died on Dec. 8 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital due to declining health. He was 85.
After graduating in 1952 from Villanova, Restic played professional baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies and football with the Eagles.
His collegiate coaching career began in 1956, when Restic took over as an assistant at Brown. He accepted the same position at Colgate three years later before becoming head coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1968.
Restic came to Cambridge in 1971 and went on to set school records in both games coached and games won, nabbing conference titles in 1974, 1975, 1982, 1983, and 1987.
At the time of his retirement in 1993, his 117 victories were 39 more than anyone else in Harvard history, and his 92 Ivy wins placed him third in the Ancient Eight all-time.
Positing that football went well beyond just “one guy beating another guy” and inspired by the Canadian league’s loosened style, Restic developed a complex offensive strategy—what he termed the “multiflex offense,” short for “completely multiple and totally flexible”—that used an unprecedented variety of shifting formations and patterns.
Bruce G. Schoenfeld ’82, a Crimson sports editor who covered Harvard football, recalled that Restic once joked about his scheme: “My offense is so complicated, it takes five years to learn it.”
Roger E. Caron ’84 played offensive line for Restic all four years. Caron remembered often seeing Restic in his office, sitting in complete darkness except for a small light on his 16mm film projector, watching game footage and devising yet another plan of attack.
Every Monday, Restic came prepared with 25 to 30 new plays and formations for his players to absorb, explaining their nuances in exacting detail. James P. Kubacki ’77, who played quarterback under Restic, said that he and the other quarterbacks had to divide the lot in order to memorize.
“He may not beat them, but he will confuse them,” The Crimson once wrote.
Robert A. Glatz ’88, who played running back for Restic, said that memorizing Restic’s plays each week was similar to studying for a class.
“It was like taking a masters course,” Kubacki said. “And you had to take your hourly exam in front of thousands of people every week.”
Caron, a former National Football League player who now coaches the Pomona-Pitzer football team in Claremont, Calif., said that Restic influenced his approach to coaching—emphasizing to his players that higher-order thinking was not meant only for the classroom.
“We’re often overmatched physically,” Caron said, “but we find ways to hang in there through the intellectual process of football.”
Restic told his players that if Harvard was about challenging one to the best of his ability, why was football any different?
Schoenfeld said that Restic was “almost too smart for Harvard.”
“He’s probably the hardest ‘professor’ I ever had,” said Kubacki, who returned to Harvard in 1982 to assist Restic.
Restic believed that football was the tool to make one a better person, Kubacki said. He challenged his players to think on their feet but maintained that at the end of the day, it was one’s values in life—not taking shortcuts, giving the best effort, being humble—that mattered most.
“Joe was not obsessed by winning,” Caron said. “He was concerned about everybody graduating, never embarrassing the program.”
Prior to the 1993 season, Restic announced that his 23rd year with Harvard would be his last. The Crimson lost to Yale on Nov. 20, 1993, to finish in last place in the league—the worst campaign of Restic’s tenure.
“Once his career was over, it was over,” said Restic’s son David L. Restic. “He felt as though he did it, done that. He never really lived in the past and always looked forward into the future.”
Current coach Tim Murphy’s hiring was announced a month later. On Nov. 5, 2011, Murphy broke Restic’s all-time wins record after beating Columbia, 35-21, and collecting his 118th victory. In an interview with The Crimson a few days later, Restic praised Murphy for rewriting the record books.
“Timmy’s a great guy, an excellent coach, and he deserved to break my record,” Restic said.
“Joe was typical of ‘The Greatest Generation,’ an extremely accomplished guy who was the last one to let you know it,” Murphy wrote in an emailed statement. “To me, he was a simple guy in the best possible context. He loved his family, his country, and coaching college football.”
Restic is survived by children Kathleen, Joseph, Suzan, and David. His wife Marian “Bea” Restic died of colon cancer in 2008 at the age of 77.
A funeral Mass was held on Tuesday in Milford, Mass. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, memorial donations should be made to the American Cancer Society in Framingham, Mass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blayn Jiggetts, one of three men found guilty of the murder that took place in a Harvard dormitory two years ago, was sentenced to 9 to 12 years in prison.
Jiggetts and his co-defendant Jason F. Aquino were each charged with first-degree murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in exchange for lighter sentences.
The third defendant, Jabrai Jordan Copney, pleaded not guilty and stood trial last spring. Convicted in April, Copney received life in prison without parole, the mandatory sentence for first-degree murder convictions.
The three men were charged in the killing of Justin Cosby, a 21-year-old Cambridge resident who was shot in the basement of a Kirkland House entryway in 2009. According to prosecutors, the three defendants—all residents of New York City—intended to rob Cosby of a large quantity of marijuana at gunpoint. When Cosby refused to hand over the drugs, one of the men, allegedly Copney, shot and killed him.
Both Jiggetts and Aquino initially pleaded not guilty but then made deals to avoid a trial and reduce their time in prison. Jiggetts was offered a guarantee of 9 to 12 years’ incarceration in exchange for cooperating as a witness in Copney’s trial. He testified that Copney was the one who planned the armed robbery and fired the murder weapon.
Throughout the trial, Copney’s attorney argued that Jiggetts was actually the one who shot Cosby.
The jury found Copney guilty of felony murder, meaning that a death resulted from the defendant’s attempt to commit a crime which is itself punishable by up to life in prison. In this case, that crime was armed robbery, an offense in which all three men were complicit—meaning that regardless of who pulled the trigger, all three could have been convicted of first-degree murder and thus would have faced life in prison if they had stood trial.
Aquino, who pleaded guilty but did not serve as a witness in Copney’s trial, was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison.
As of Jiggetts’ sentencing hearing in October, he had already served 862 days of his sentence. He was arrested in New York City in June 2009, less than a month after the shooting, and has been held without bail since then.
The final person charged in the case was Brittany J. Smith, who was a senior at Harvard at the time of the murder. Copney, her boyfriend, had been living with her in her Lowell House room. Smith and her friend Chanequa N. Campbell, also a Harvard senior at the time, were dismissed from the College just two weeks before graduating due to their connection with the homicide.
Campbell was granted a non-prosecution agreement for her cooperation and appeared on the witness stand during Copney’s trial. Smith initially made a similar agreement but then breached it by lying to prosecutors in order to protect Copney.
Smith was then indicted on charges that she hid the murder weapon after the shooting, helped the three men flee to New York, and repeatedly misled to investigators. She pleaded guilty to five of the six counts against her in September and received a three-year prison sentence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male undergraduate student was the victim of an armed robbery on Tuesday night near the intersection of Mt. Auburn and Dunster Streets, according to an email sent to the Harvard community by the Harvard University Police Department.
The victim was walking with a companion down Dunster Street at around 6:50 p.m. when he was approached from behind and felt a hard object against his back, according to the HUPD advisory and an eyewitness statement.
When the victim turned around, an unknown man demanded his wallet, stating, “You don’t want to get stabbed.”
The victim promptly gave the assailant his wallet. The assailant then fled the scene.
The victim was not injured in the course of the robbery.
The victim’s companion, Andrew K. Murray ’13, described the robber as a tall, white male. He said he and his friend were in a well-lit section of the street, headed toward Kirkland House, when the robber approached them.
Following the incident, the victim reported the crime to the Cambridge Police Department.
Murray said the wallet contained $50 in cash and all of his friend’s credit or debit cards.
In its email, HUPD stated, “If you are approached by someone displaying a weapon and demanding your property, it is recommended that you comply with the request and not resist.”
According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, the Cambridge Police Department is investigating the robbery since it did not occur on Harvard University property.
Last year, a string of 10 robberies, some committed by the same offenders, occurred on or near Harvard’s campus between Oct. 30 and Nov. 21. Following the crime wave, suspects were arrested and HUPD increased the number of officers on patrol.
According to statistics on its website, CPD responded to 36 street robberies across Cambridge between Aug. 2 and Nov. 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Abe Liu, a 27-year-old student at Harvard Extension School, was escorted out of Weld Hall on Thursday by Harvard University Police Department officers after sleeping in friends’ rooms in the freshman dormitory and telling students that he was a freshman at the College.
Over a period of two months, Liu told Harvard students that he lived in Weld, a dorm in Harvard Yard. He sometimes spent the night there when invited by freshman acquaintances.
Liu also created a presence at Harvard online, posting frequently to the Harvard University Class of 2015 Facebook group and becoming friends on the social networking website with Harvard students he had never met in person. Pictures of Liu taken in freshman dorms and posted on Facebook added to his credibility, acquaintances said. Since Thursday, Liu’s account has become unsearchable and his posts to the Harvard freshman group are gone.
Though suspicions about Liu’s identity arose among freshmen primarily due to his lack of swipe access to Harvard buildings, it remains unclear who alerted HUPD.
“Although the man was invited into [the] building, he was not a College affiliate and College officials determined that he was no longer welcome,” HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement.
Students said to have hosted Liu in their room and the proctor in the entryway that Liu frequented declined to comment for this story.
In the days following Liu’s removal from Weld, rumors and questions about his identity and intentions have circulated among students at the College, sparking debate and speculation over various email lists, on Facebook, through student-generated internet memes, and in an article published online by The Harvard Independent, a weekly student newspaper.
Liu said that his removal from Weld and the subsequent rumors resulted from lies he told in an attempt to gain friends that spiraled out of control.
Liu’s account of his path to Harvard is this: He spent some time in college in North Carolina. Then he dropped out of school to compete in triathlons, an activity he had enjoyed from an early age. When that dream did not pan out, he decided to enroll at the Harvard Extension School in the hope of eventually becoming a doctor.
Liu said that during the summer before matriculating at Harvard, he came across the Class of 2015 Facebook group. Out of curiousity, he joined. Once he was in the group, he began to interact with members of the freshman class. He said that he took to “trolling” the group as a hobby.
“I just played off like I was a student. It got addicting,” Liu said. “It got fun.”
Liu said he spent less time on Facebook when the fall arrived and he filled his time with a job and academic work. But after quitting his job in late September to focus on his medical studies, he found himself with spare time and decided to return to the Facebook group.
Liu said he was curious about the people he had met online and wanted to put a face to their “internet identities.” According to Liu, he told his first lies when he met those students in person.
“The first lie is like, ‘Oh, I’m a student at the College,’” he said. “They always want to know more, so you start telling a lot of little white lies. And then you find yourself integrated into that society.”
Liu said that when a freshman acquaintance asked him to spend time in Weld, he was reluctant, but he eventually decided to go ahead. Sometime during October, he began telling freshmen he lived there.
“You get so deep, you don’t know how to stop it,” he said.
He said that though he was untruthful, he never had any malicious intent.
“At the end of the day, all I wanted to do was to be friends,” he said. “The people that met me, the people that knew me, know that I never asked them for anything. I never coerced them into anything.”
Liu said that many accusations leveled against him in students’ online chatter are unfounded. He specifically insisted that assertions in The Harvard Independent’s story are unfounded, including allegations that he stole a freshman’s Harvard ID and that he participated in The Crimson’s Grand Elections ceremony.
Liu said he did not take someone else’s ID but that he did forge an ID, one that he described as “not really even passable.” For over a month, since the Occupy Harvard encampment began, security personnel have been posted at the gates of the Yard to check every entrant for a Harvard ID.
According to Anastasiya Borys ’15, who lives in the entryway that Liu spent time in, students noticed early on that Liu was not in the Freshman Register and assumed that he was an Extension School student.
“He used to hang out in Weld a lot,” said entryway resident Selina Y. Wang ’15. “We assumed that he was in the Extension School. I guess we didn’t think much about it, but then we started getting suspicious about it when he started to have people swipe him in everywhere.”
When Liu was apprehended by police on Thursday, these students who had come to know him as a familiar face or even a problem set buddy said they were shaken.
“People were just kind of shocked. We had joked before that he didn’t even go here,” Borys said.
Reina A.E. Gattuso ’15, a Crimson magazine writer who lives in the entryway, said, “I personally found it a bit unsettling, and I think some of my peers did. There was definitely a lot of curiosity and a sense of ‘Why is this guy doing this?’”
Liu said that he sympathizes with the students’ concern and did not intend to cause disruption to the entryway.
“I understand the position. They’re scared. It doesn’t make any sense. They feel betrayed,” he said. “I made a mistake. My mistake was being lonely.”

In the haste to cram your belongings into an overflowing suitcase, some things inevitably get left behind. As you're leaving school for the month, don't forget to pack these items:
1. Your resume. Get those internships for the summer. But don't bother if you're a psych major—it's just not happening.
2. Your tent, if you're part of Occupy Harvard.
3. Your proctor's baby. They'll never know it was you.
4. Your acoustic guitar. You bought it out of excitement, but can only play that one Green Day song.
 
5. Your sleeping bag. In the time you've been gone, your mom has converted your room into her scrapbooking den. Also applies if you're part of Occupy Harvard.
6. Your lip gloss. Sure, you don't use it here, but maybe your dad will appreciate it.
7. Your Harvard sweatshirt. How else will the guy sitting next to you on the Bolt Bus know where you go to school?
8. Your roommate's key. Next semester, the suite will be your palace.
