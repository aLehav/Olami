After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Obama addressed the nation to announce that he was taking executive action on immigration. Nobody is entirely happy with his plan, although the withered Democrat House minority is pretending that they are. Republicans denounced it as an unlawful “amnesty,” while immigrants rights groups are angry that after all this time the president still refuses to go far enough.
I must admit that when a President resorts to executive orders to implement a major policy change, I cannot help but view him as something of a failure in the legislative arena. At the risk of delving too deeply into political science jargon, executive orders are intended to function as part of the president’s “completion power.” Although there is no explicit mention of them in the Constitution, executive orders have been issued in differing numbers by every president since Washington under the justification of Article II, Section 3, Clause 5 that orders the president to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” They are used primarily as a method for filling in the blanks in legislation. Congress is by no means omnipotent, and hence the laws that they pass tend to be of a general nature. They paint the contours of a new policy in broad strokes, and the president in his capacity as chief executive is expected to fill in the details by issuing marching orders to executive departments and agencies regarding their “proper” interpretation.
Herein lies the problem. President Obama is filling in the blanks in a law that has not yet materialized. That is called legislating, and that is not his job.
That is really too bad, because the policy changes that he outlined Thursday night are not radical. In his own words: “If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation.” The “temporarily” of which he speaks is a mere three years (long enough to push a permanent decision on the issue past the 2016 presidential election, cynics will say—and they’ll be right). But his decision is ultimately a practical one. There is no way that we could feasibly identify, round up, and deport 11 million people, and if we did the cost of the operation would number in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
Obama’s “deal” will not apply to anyone who has arrived in the last five years, including the massive influx of unaccompanied minors who poured into Texas this summer; it would not apply to anyone arriving illegally in the future (thus deflating the argument that this move will encourage further illegal immigration); it will not apply to any individual with a criminal background (and will probably accelerate deportations of criminals now that they are the main priority for law enforcement resources); and, perhaps most importantly, it grants citizenship to no one. This is not an amnesty. President Obama’s message is: “Let’s halt deportations of the good guys for a while so we can figure this out.”
So while this is not an ideal fix for the situation, it is something that I can live with. My ideal solution would look something like this: Speaker Boehner allowing a vote in the House on the full 2013 Senate immigration bill. Fourteen Republican senators, including our 2008 presidential nominee, joined with all 52 Democrats and Independents to vote for that bill. Is it a perfect conservative solution to the problem? Of course not, but we are not going to get one with this president in the White House even with large Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress. Does that mean that we should twiddle our thumbs until we have a Republican in the Oval Office as well? It shouldn’t, because President Obama is right in characterizing our present situation as an effective amnesty for the millions that flaunted our laws and entered the United States illegally. The fact of the matter is that we have ignored the problem for far too long and it has metastasized to a dimension that is entirely unmanageable. There are too many people here to deport, and too many potential contributors of tax revenue to ignore.
I do not speak in such clinical language to diminish the humanity of undocumented immigrants, for I find the argument that they will destroy our American culture tedious at best and anti-American at worst. I speak in terms of dollars and cents because mercy is not in the job description of the American government. The Constitution and its amendments provide for the rights of American citizens, and if a person is not an American citizen then the Constitution simply has nothing to say regarding them. The federal government does not have an obligation to be merciful; it does have a duty, however, to “establish justice” and to “promote the General Welfare.” Requiring the payment of a fine and back taxes is the easiest way to satisfy those goals with regard to the undocumented population already in America. If we stop dithering and complete a reform of the broken American immigration system now, then we won’t have to make such a choice in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I started my sophomore year at Harvard, I was both excited and hopeful. I knew that I would eventually gripe and grumble over the hectic nights of studying and work. But I eagerly looked forward to spending time with my friends and pursuing my academic interests. I never would have imagined that, at the end of the semester, I would be seeing my face plastered across the front pages of the news.
In several weeks, it will have been a year since I emailed false bomb threats during my final exams. Looking back, I can only cringe at my sheer stupidity and immaturity. I do not wish to attempt to make any excuses for I have none or shy away from accepting full responsibility. What I do wish to do is apologize.
While my apology extends to all those who were negatively affected by my behavior, I would like to particularly apologize to the citizens of Cambridge, the community of Harvard and the first responders and law enforcement officials.
In a way, I was so ridiculously egocentric. As I got closer to my last exam, I felt that I was under a huge amount of personal and academic pressure. I had been sleep-deprived for days and was not thinking clearly. I could have gone to bed, sought help or just simply taken an exam I felt unprepared for. Instead, in the face of this anxiety and stress and blinded by the light of my ambitions, I lost sight of logic and reason. I absurdly acted in a way that put my personal priorities over the well-being of everyone else.
By doing so, I set off a wave of mortifying consequences. I drained and diverted taxes and public resources. I hope to help defray some of those costs through restitution but am aware that it is a limited gesture.  Even more importantly, law enforcement officers and first responders have far more significant responsibilities than to be burdened by a foolish hoax. I disrupted the schedules of so many of my peers and caused them unwarranted stress and confusion. Stress is a universal ingredient found in the weeks of final exams in college. To think that my troubles were any greater than those of my peers was a lapse in judgment and showed an inexplicable lack of empathy. I am deeply saddened that I have blemished and embarrassed my school and classmates in the spotlight of the media. I betrayed the very community that I had intimately become a part of and come to love. I also realize that I upset the community of Cambridge by causing concern. In the light of last year’s Boston Marathon tragedy, my actions were even more grossly inappropriate.
With the gracious support of friends, family and classmates, I have used this past year to deeply reflect and to consider the relevant circumstances and my personal failures. I would give anything to turn back the hands of time. But given that I cannot, I can only look to the future. I fully recognize that this letter of apology can only mean so much. I know that true apology and hopefully forgiveness will come from my contributions and actions over time. I have been intensively engaged in counseling, community service, and work. I have always made an effort to give back to the community through service and projects and have been doing so even more actively since this incident. I am incredibly fortunate to have been given an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and move on. I would be a fool to waste it.
To those students who are struggling, I can say that I only now realize how the actions of a single thoughtless moment can be absolutely devastating. As a student, it is so easy to lose perspective and to ignore the warning signs of excessive stress as you begin to think that there is nothing more important than a particular paper or exam. If you are struggling, I urge you to get help. I was much too timid to ask for help when I most needed it. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness or one of defeat. Letting emotional and mental stress escalate and bubble beneath the surface drives one to desperation and is extremely dangerous. There are so many people and a diverse range of resources ready to help if only we have the courage to open up and reach out.
I deeply regret my conduct and apologize profusely for the harm that I caused. I am truly appreciative of the support I have gotten from the Harvard community and am grateful to those that have helped resolve this in a way that leaves me a path to the life I want for my family and myself. I have learned many hard lessons over the past year – about remorse, gratitude, friendship, ambition, and second chances. I hope that my experience will be a cautionary tale for all. Looking towards the immediate future, I will have to face the consequences for my actions, including home confinement, community service, probation, restitution and a fine.  Beyond that, I will continue to carry on the lessons I have learned about pressure, stress, perspective and selfishness. But perhaps most importantly, I will be committed to becoming a better person and a more selfless member of this community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, seven Harvard students, all members of Divest Harvard, filed a lawsuit asking for a court to force Harvard to “withdraw” its holdings from the fossil fuel industry. The lawsuit’s legal argument is based on the idea that Harvard is violating its original charter and its “fiduciary and charitable duties as a public charity and nonprofit corporation” by investing in “abnormally dangerous activities,” notably the fossil fuel industry. This line of reasoning is tenuous and does not contribute to the kind of dialogue necessary for Harvard to better combat climate change.
Divest Harvard serves an important role in calling attention to climate change itself, but we continue to believe that divestment is not the best way for Harvard to address the phenomenon. Even if the University were to divest from fossil fuels, it would continue using those fuels in day-to-day business, and other entities would likely replace Harvard as investors—investors that may be less likely than Harvard to pressure the industry in a more climate-friendly direction.
The recent lawsuit is tenuous at best as a move to trigger divestment on legal grounds. According to the New York Times, one of its chief legal arguments cites “mismanagement of charitable funds,” based on Massachusetts case law allowing those with “special interest” in an organization to sue based on mismanagement of the organization’s funds. Yet there does not seem to be precedent to rule for such a suit based on investment in the fossil fuel industry, and in any event, Harvard’s endowment appears financially sound.
Another chief legal argument in the suit is based on a tort with no precedent. This tort, as the plaintiffs present it, involves “intentional investment in abnormally dangerous activities.” The fact that this tort does not exist is enough to call into question the value of this claim, but it also seems to set a fairly drastic precedent—if a court were to rule against Harvard on these grounds, it would seem that any organization investing in fossil fuels would also be liable to such a lawsuit. To sue Harvard on these grounds when so many other institutions have similar investments seems less than tenable.
Of course, the lawsuit is more than the sum of its legal claims. One of the plaintiffs claimed that part of the goal in bringing the suit is to bring greater attention to the issue. In general, we support greater discussion of climate change. We are not convinced, however, that this suit will spark conversation on the topic in a constructive way. A plaintiff’s acknowledgement that a “sympathetic judge” will need to be sought to even consider the case underscores this worry. The reasoning of the suit could appear so tenuous as to make individuals believe that divestment itself, or even climate change activism, is a tenuous idea. Frivolous litigation is not what the wider climate change discussion needs.
While divestment may not be a desirable course of action, activities that spark constructive discussion about climate change should be welcomed. This lawsuit does not seem like such an activity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the verdict came down I really wanted to feel anger. I wanted to talk to my friends, both black and white, and talk about how livid the failure to indict made me, but ultimately I could not. As I sat silently in my chair, slouching down as far as possible, I could not really feel much of anything. Another young black man, much like me, was killed and there is nothing I can do to change that fact. No matter what I do, Michael Brown will remain dead and Darren Wilson will never fear criminal prosecution for his actions.
I do not have any illusions of being a legal expert. Without doubt, the defenders, prosecutors, and jurors have far more information regarding this case than I do. As such, I do not intend to try to convince anyone of Darren Wilson’s innocence or guilt. In more ways than one, Wilson’s culpability for this crime remains secondary. Taking a step back, the case of Michael Brown and Darren Wilson amounts to one case in a small town in Missouri. The responsibility of adjudicating the particular facts of this case fell to the courts and I am certainly not qualified to determine whether or not they honestly undertook this duty.
But the response to this case magnifies social unrest and institutional ineptitude that pervades every corner of this country. There should have been no need to protest the killing of an unarmed black male. This case, like so many others the public will never discover, should have fallen into obscurity. Black people in Ferguson and across the country did not protest as a blind display of raw emotion, though without doubt these displays have been emotionally charged. The people of Ferguson took to the streets because they felt they saw no other way to seek justice. In a world where those meant to protect all cut down black bodies with little remorse, the people of Ferguson saw protest as the only way to guarantee due process.
And let us not lose sight of the stakes. Despite how many news outlets and public commentators have depicted them, protestors in Ferguson and beyond are not lynch mobs. They did not endure tear gas, military grade rifles, and tanks to try to tarnish the already tattered reputation of a police officer. Protestors simply wanted an indictment. An indictment is by no means a declaration of guilt or innocence. An indictment will not do any more to damage the life of Officer Wilson. At the end of the day, the people simply wanted an opportunity to fully investigate the death of an unarmed man. After the grand jury’s decision not to indict, we will never know exactly what happened between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson.
Each slain black body seems to erase a decade of progress in race relations. Not only does each case further polarize the population along racial lines, but it also seems to lower the bar on what is considered justice. After the events of Monday night, I found myself being thankful that at least Trayvon Martin’s killer was indicted. At least the Martin family had the opportunity to have their day in court and allow the full legal process take its course. Starting here only further underscores how inept the legal system has become at prosecuting offenders that prematurely cut down black bodies.
By and large, a prosecutor can get almost any grand jury to indict. Getting an indictment is so easy that New York State Chief Judge Sol Wachtler once said a prosecutor could persuade a grand jury to “indict a ham sandwich.” Put aside the fact that the grand jury failed to indict Wilson. The fact that the black community across the country felt compelled to fight for an indictment implies a history of systematic miscarriage of justice. We do not reach this point unless we have been here before and seen first hand how little black lives are valued.
People react very differently to situations like this. Immediately following the Monday night press conference announcing the verdict, I watched my Facebook newsfeed explode with rampant indignation form my peers, especially the black ones. Calls and texts came in asking if there were any accessible protests in the area. Black organizations prepared official responses to try to put words to the troubling feelings in the hearts of many parts of the student body. Everyone wanted to do something. Finding the right something may take several tries and potentially even some soul searching, but everyone I came in contact with wanted to get involved.
The urge to do something, in large part, comes from a flurry of emotions sparked by a heinous event. On a college campus, living with your peers and high levels of interconnectivity only amplifies these feelings. Angry texts, tweets, and Facebook posts beget more anger that in many cases leads to the militancy that demands immediate action. After the jury found George Zimmerman not guilty, I took to Union Square to protest for just that reason. Months of languishing with my fellow 17 to 18 year old black male friends made us all feel like we could be next and something should be done. At the time, I thought I joined the movement that would change everything.
But now I know better. I have no illusions about the world we all live in. Grand gestures may make us feel like we have made an impact, but they never single handedly create change. The March on Washington did not cause the Civil Rights Act. As much as I want to feel angry and do something about Ferguson, I find myself struggling to find any real motivation. My emotional well has run dry. The failure to indict Wilson was not met with the same anger that came after Zimmerman’s exoneration. I feel nothing. This injustice has left nothing in its wake but unequivocal numbness.
At times like this, inaction seems almost appealing. Protests have failed and politicians have shown no reason they deserve our trust. Inaction allows us to lick our wounds and try to forget the truly egregious event that caused the pain. But this will only allow for further injustice. I have lost the will to protest, though I am thankful for those that do. Change must come in the hearts and minds of every citizen. Galvanizing the people requires honest dialogue without fear of judgment. This time I will not heed the call for revolution from on high, but that will not stop me and hopefully everyone else in a similar position from doing what they can on the ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marvin Zelen may have been one of the world’s leading biostatisticians, but his friends and colleagues remember him as much for his generosity as for his brilliance.
Zelen, a professor in the Biostatistics Department at the School of Public Health, died on Nov. 15 from cancer. He was 87.
L. J. Wei, Zelen’s colleague in the Biostatistics Department, said it is important to “think about how we can learn from this great man.”
Zelen enjoyed a long and productive career in biostatistics research and once advised U.S. President Richard Nixon on cancer research. At the School of Public Health, Zelen served as chair of the Biostatistics Department from 1981 to 1990, and in 1997 the school created an award in his name. The American Cancer Society and American Statistical Association also honored him with prestigious awards during his career.
Although his colleagues and friends praised the accomplishments that propelled Zelen to the top of his field, in interviews this week they said that his character was what set him apart. To Biostatistics professor Xihong Lin, one word that describes Zelen is “generosity.”
“He was always a helpful person and imaginative person,” said Mitchell H. Gail, senior investigator in the biostatistics branch of the National Cancer Institute’s division of cancer epidemiology and genetics. “He was not afraid of controversy, and he really headed things off in the right direction.”
“Even though he was a busy guy, he always had time for other people,” Wei added.
Summer Zheng, a research scientist at the School of Public Health, remembered Zelen as a resource who offered to help with anything, academic or not. Zelen advised Zheng’s thesis, and she remembers that he treated her “not as a student” but “as a colleague…on the same level.”
“He had this relationship with almost anyone that crossed paths with him,” she said. “It’s an extraordinary relationship; it’s not like any other.”
Zelen also leaves behind a legacy in the world of science because of his ingeniuity and work ethic, colleagues said.
“He’s very original with looking into problems and developing theories specific for the problem—and solving the problem,” said Sandra J. Lee, a principal research scientist at the School of Public Health. She described Zelen as “brilliant.”
“Some think he might’ve had a good long career, but I still think [his life] was cut short by cancer,” Lee said, noting that the disease in which he had made such scientific improvements ultimately took his life. “He was always actively engaged, so I still feel very sad he didn’t have a chance to continue [his research].”
Zelen is survived by his wife Thelma; two daughters, Deborah and Sandy; and two grandsons.

UPDATED: Nov. 25, 2014, at 12:00 a.m.
Undocumented students and immigration reform advocates welcomed President Barack Obama’s recent move to offer additional protection to undocumented parents of American citizens and permanent residents, but said the order falls short of providing respite to many undocumented immigrants.
Obama announced Thursday an executive order that will allow an estimated 4 million people to apply for work permits and protection from deportation.
Many Harvard students drew on personal experiences in the days following the announcement to argue that the new program will have a positive impact on undocumented students and families.
Enrique Ramirez ’16, author of several Crimson op-eds about the undocumented student experience, said the announcement would provide his parents protection from deportation.
“My youngest sibling was born here in the U.S., so [my parents] will be able to apply under the program,” Ramirez said. “I’m really happy about it.”
Lizbeth Hernandez ’16, the current director of Harvard College Act on a Dream, a student group that aims to extend educational opportunities to undocumented students, said the program will lessen the burdens placed on students with undocumented parents.
“Many [Act on a Dream members] have to contribute to their families back home and keep their parents on their minds constantly,” said Hernandez, a Crimson design and business editor.
Many students were careful to note, however, that the program does not offer help to everyone.
Selena Rincon ’17, a board member of student groups Fuerza Latina and Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA, said she was initially ecstatic about the announcement, but added that she checked her happiness after she thought about the people it would not benefit.
Jin Park ’18, who was granted protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Obama launched in 2012 for undocumented youths raised in the U.S., said the program would not apply to his parents because he is undocumented.
Park acknowledged that Obama faced political limitations in advancing reform, but argued that the program should also apply to the parents undocumented students like him. Those students are often called “Dreamers” after the DREAM Act, a bill that has failed to pass Congress several times and would provide undocumented students with a path to citizenship. Harvard has lobbied in favor of the legislation.
“Those children [with citizenship or permanent residence status] are Americans, but the Dreamers are also Americans,” he said.
Some students raised other concerns, such as how Obama’s successor could change the program and how it would affect undocumented immigrants without families. All agreed, however, that it was a positive step forward for immigration reform advocates.
Several student organizations co-hosted a watch party in anticipation of Obama’s announcement. According to Ilian A. Meza-Pena ’17, the president of Radcliffe RAZA and a member of Act on a Dream, roughly 40 students attended the watch party. They greeted the news with excitement, she said, even students who were disappointed that the program would not extend to their families.
“It’s one stepping stone,” Park said. “I’m really thankful. It’s a big step forward—but we still have a lot of work.”

As Computer Science administrators look to fill 12 new professorships endowed by former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77, faculty and students in the proliferating program say that it should use the opportunity to build upon Harvard’s liberal arts tradition and expand existing interdisciplinary offerings.
Although not the largest concentration at Harvard, computer science is one of the fastest-growing fields of study here and nationally. Computer science attracted 101 new concentrators this fall alone, bringing the total number of concentrators to 297, compared to last fall’s 253. Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” stands as the highest enrolled course at the College this semester, with 778 undergraduates.
At the same time that the field of study has exploded across higher education, Harvard’s peer institutions have sought to encourage interdisciplinary study between computer science and the humanities or social sciences. This fall, for example, Stanford introduced a program called “CS+X” in which students can pair a CS major with a humanities major. And just last week, Columbia announced that it will offer a course next spring aimed to teach students programming in the context of English, history, or economics.
The Ballmer gift, which is estimated to be around $60 million, will likely give Harvard a chance to explore similar offerings as the sheer number of courses and areas of professorial expertise increase with the new professorships, members of the Computer Science Division say.
Assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology and computer science David D. Cox ’00 said that he believes that CS literacy needs to be prioritized going forward for all students alongside numerical and normal literacy. For those not solely dedicated to computer science, he said skills learned in the discipline should be applied to their own fields of study.
“[Computer science's growing stature] puts a large burden on the University to make sure students have these skills for the next century,” Cox said. “The investment the University is making in the field is spot on, and we need to do more.”
Computer Science professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher, a former dean of the division, agreed that with the new professorships and additional resources, Harvard can focus on refining an already “outward facing” CS program to reach more students, though not necessarily with programs like Stanford’s or Columbia’s that explicitly combine two fields.
“We’re not just about being focused inwardly on computer science,” Mitzenmacher said, noting that two years ago somewhere between one third to one half of students in general CS courses were non-concentrators. “We’re focused on being housed in a liberal arts university, taking advantage of all the University’s resources.”
He added, “We haven’t gone through a system of having specific tracks. What we’ve generally tried to have is a flat system with minimal prerequisites so people can come in and take whatever they want and they need.”
Others say that as the number of concentrators in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences continues to grow at the expense of other academic divisions, increased commitment to interdisciplinary work and the attraction of non-concentrators to CS courses will be key to maintaining balance between fields of study.
“It’s going to be a big time of change at the University as people are going to look at computer science,” said Zack A. Chauvin ’17, a computer science concentrator. “What’s going to happen when a liberal arts college has a significant portion who wants to study in SEAS?”
Stanford computer science professor Eric S. Roberts ’73 said that the proliferation of computer science programs at research universities like Harvard and Stanford has “changed...a bit of the balance of a university.”
“For places like Harvard and Stanford, which have very strong liberal arts tradition, building these bridges and allowing students to combine these modalities of study will better maintain the balance within the University,” he said.

Faculty from the departments of Anthropology, Linguistics, and East Asian Languages and Civilizations have endorsed a 12-student cap on section sizes, expressing support for the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement urging Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators to adopt the cap.
“We endorsed the goal of reducing the section size to 12 because we think that it would create a better learning environment for students in the College,” Jay H. Jasanoff ’63, chair of the Linguistics Department, wrote in an email. “It would also create a better teaching environment for teaching fellows, who are now sometimes badly stretched in homework-intense courses.”
Rowan K. Flad, interim chair of the Anthropology Department, said the department’s entire faculty expressed unequivocal support of the Teaching Campaign.
“As soon as the issue was discussed, everyone was shocked that there would even be an discussion about it,” he said. “A motion to approve was unanimously supported without much discussion.”
To date, 10 departments or committees, all in the humanities or social sciences, have endorsed the Teaching Campaign’s cause. Additionally, 57 percent of voters in last week’s Undergraduate Council presidential election supported a referendum question on capping section sizes at 12 students. That election saw a turnout of just under 50 percent of undergraduates.
Section sizes are decided by a number of factors, including funding levels set by top University administrators. As a result, these endorsements will not necessarily result immediately in smaller sections in the departments.
Still, according to Flad, the University has accommodated the Anthropology Department’s past requests to cap section sizes at 12 for certain courses conducted in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, where the presence of the museum’s artifacts created a space constraint.
In the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, the motion to endorse the section-size cap carried with overwhelming but not unanimous support, according to interim Department Chair David L. Howell.
A statement released by the department cited several problems created by oversized sections, including inhibited student participation, less effective teacher-training, and the financial insecurity of teaching fellows. The statement said that the 12-student cap should only apply to classes outside the language program, where the current section sizes are around 10 students.
“We urge other departments at Harvard to express their support for this initiative,” the statement read.
Administrators are planning to hold a town hall meeting in December to discuss section sizes. According to Campaign member Cristina V. Groeger ’08, the meeting will bring together administrators and faculty from the departments that have endorsed the 12-person cap.

Allston residents demanded solutions to what they called chronic problems—particularly competition for parking from construction workers—facing the community as a result of Harvard’s development in Allston at a tense Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Monday night.
Residents and task force members said that in addition to the parking problem, they fear that Saturday work hours and damaging construction vibrations will plague the neighborhood over the next decade as Harvard continues to develop its Allston campus.
“If we don’t get this right now, we’re going to be talking about these issues for the next 10 years,” task force chair Raymond V. Mellone said. “We have to understand where the responsibility of Harvard lies.”
With the influx of construction workers into the neighborhood and the lack of free parking for their vehicles, homeowners say that available parking on residential streets is disappearing.
Community members also pointed to parking issues stemming from both University-run projects on the Business School campus and ongoing construction of the Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons, the property Harvard leased to developer Samuels & Associates, whose representatives also attended the meeting.
For construction projects at both the Business School and the Barry’s Corner site, construction workers who cannot find parking on-site are instructed to park at Soldiers Field garage on Western Ave., but residents fear that the workers continue to park on residential streets to avoid the $15 garage fee. Homeowners requested that Harvard subsidize the workers’ parking costs, a benefit no other Harvard employees receive.
“We know that there are 100 cars parking somewhere,” task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said. “It’s nuts to think that there’s not a problem here.”
Representatives from the University disagreed.
“We don’t believe there is a systemic problem with our parking plan,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications. This month, the University conducted a study comparing the neighborhood’s parking situation on Veteran’s Day, when no construction projects were underway, with a regular workday. Based on that study’s findings, Casey claimed that the impact from Harvard’s construction on residential parking is limited.
Casey argued that the parking plans Harvard has already implemented successfully address community concerns. Task force members pushed back.
“You don’t have a way to minimize the problem,” Mellone said. “What you have is a way to minimize your concern.”
Task force member Bruce E. Houghton said the issue goes beyond empirical studies.
“Whether you’re right or wrong doesn’t make any difference,” Houghton said, addressing University representatives. “You’ve spent a lot of time building a positive relationship [with the community]. Do you want to see this go down the tubes over parking?”
Community members also debated eliminating unregulated parking on residential streets. Many other residential communities in the greater Boston area, including Harvard Square, have implemented metered or resident-only parking.
“The community has got to take control of its streets sooner or later,” community member Anthony D’Isidoro said. He added that the only real solution was for the City of Boston to effect changes in Allston’s parking regulations.
In the short term, residents said that they expect the University to mitigate the impact of construction workers on residential parking.
“There’s clearly an opportunity for Harvard to resolve this,” task force member John A. Bruno said. “It’s a [public relations] fiasco if it continues on.”

Emphasizing the importance for host nations to develop infrastructure, services, and policy that last after the conclusion of major sporting events, Brazilian Vice-Minister of Sports Luis Fernandes discussed Brazil’s preparation for both the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics at a panel on Monday evening.
Held at the Law School and moderated by Law School professor Charles R. Nesson ’60, the panel opened with Nesson noting that the event was relevant to Boston’s current bid to host the upcoming Olympic Games in 2024.
Fernandes said that in preparing for a Boston bid, organizers should clearly communicate the consequences, both beneficial and negative, of hosting the Olympics to the Boston community. Organizers for the Brazilian games, Fernandes said, communicated these realities to citizens and sought to maximize the benefits of hosting the World Cup and the Olympics.
“The legacy of both games…was always an important aspect of our planning,” he said.
Brazilian organizers recognized the unique opportunity in hosting both sporting events to make crucial improvements in the country, he argued.
“The reason we struggled so hard to host both sporting events was not for the games themselves,” Fernandes said, “but because we identified in both the World Cup and in the Olympic Games historic opportunities to foster national, regional, and local development in Brazil.”
In preparation for the events, the Brazilian government began improving infrastructure and services both directly related to the games’ organization and to the country’s needs before and after the events, Fernandes said. In addition, officials enacted policies to take advantage of the business and innovation opportunities available as a host country.
After the panel, Pedro Trengrouse, a visiting scholar at the Law School and a consultant to the United Nations, said Boston organizers “should be innovative in their approach towards the Olympic Games.”
Trengrouse said that as social media increasingly replaces television as the primary medium of communication during the Games, Boston, as a tech hub, is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the sports industry.
This, he explained, is of even greater importance, because if Boston hosts the 2024 Olympics and the International Olympic Committee loses money, the city would have to cover the loss of revenue.

The Cambridge City Council discussed the Strategic Recommendations for a Citywide Plan, a project led by City Manager Richard C. Rossi in cooperation with a team of outside consultants, at its regular meeting Monday.
The plan was created in response to City Council interest earlier this year in an outline of goals and recommendations to guide future change in Cambridge and in light of recent complaints from Cambridge residents regarding a perceived lack of communication from the government as well as development and noise in the neighborhoods.
The Citywide Plan discusses themes of transportation in Cambridge, sustaining and encouraging social equity and diversity, enhancing economic infrastructure, and creating safe public spaces to encourage community cohesion and interaction.
“What we are seeing in these discussions is a cultural shift in the community that happens in every community every so often,” City Councillor Marc C. McGovern said. “We want to make sure that as we are improving the neighborhoods, we are keeping in mind that it is a place for local kids to congregate.… We cannot push out the local teenagers.”
During the public comments section of the meeting, Cambridge residents offered feedback on the state of the city. Resident Carol O’Hare complained about the increase in noise throughout the neighborhoods in Cambridge.
“We are being inundated with extraneous unnecessary noise more and more,” said O’Hare, who suggested requiring mufflers for automobiles and limiting hours of construction and landscape services.
Cambridge resident Cathy Hoffman expressed her concerns about the increase in development in Cambridge and the future of the city’s historic neighborhoods.
“The growth of commercial projects and innovation industries has disproportionately undone the livelihood of the lower income, older, diverse, artistic neighborhoods,” Hoffman said.
Hoffman also expressed her support for streamlined public information to “facilitate dialogue and spread information.”
Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher concluded the discussion by suggesting that dialogue on the issue will continue.
“We live in an old manufacturing community with a street grid laid out well over 100 years ago…. We are adapting to meet todays needs,” Maher said. “Places we know are not going to look the same 10 years from now. It is my hope that the integrity of our neighborhoods remains solid and the same.”
“I am very hopeful about this process and the community,” he said.
At the meeting, the councilors also discussed the feasibility of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

UPDATED: November 25, 2014, at 8:10 p.m.
Eldo Kim, the Harvard undergraduate charged with threatening to bomb four campus buildings last December, spoke out on Tuesday for the first time since his actions brought the University to a halt nearly a year ago, publishing a statement in The Harvard Crimson apologizing for his actions.
In the statement, Kim took full responsibility for the emailed bomb threats, which he sent to the Harvard University Police Department, The Harvard Crimson, and two Harvard officials half an hour before he was scheduled to take a final exam at 9 a.m. on Dec. 16, 2013. The threats triggered responses from local, state, and federal authorities, as well as the evacuation of the Science Center, Emerson, Sever, and Thayer halls, the buildings in which Kim allegedly wrote he planted the bombs. Authorities also locked down Harvard Yard.
The closures lasted for around five hours as HUPD, Cambridge Police, and federal law enforcement searched campus, clearing the four threatened buildings one by one. Several exams scheduled in the morning and afternoon were also cancelled. Many students made up the affected exams in February.
Kim wrote in the statement on Tuesday that he could “only cringe at [his] sheer stupidity and immaturity” and felt he “betrayed the very community that [he] had intimately become a part of and come to love.” He blamed sleep deprivation, personal anxiety, and academic pressure as the main factors that caused him to send the threats.
“[I]n the face of this anxiety and stress and blinded by the light of my ambitions, I lost sight of logic and reason,” Kim wrote. “I absurdly acted in a way that put my personal priorities over the well-being of everyone else.”
Kim’s attorney Allison D. Burroughs wrote in an emailed statement later in the day that Kim hopes to finish his degree at Harvard, but that the Administrative Board will ultimately determine whether or not he can return. She added that Kim has “wanted to apologize for sometime,” but that she wanted him to wait until the matter was resolved legally before allowing him to make public comment.
The public apology is one of the tasks outlined in the legal agreement Kim received last month in which the U.S. Attorney’s Office has deferred prosecution for 18 months as Kim completes a pre-trial diversionary program. Under the terms of the program, Kim also will be confined to his home for four months, will have to complete 750 hours of community service, and will have to pay restitution to the law enforcement agencies that responded to his bomb threats. If he meets the terms of this agreement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has said it will dismiss all charges.
“I am incredibly fortunate to have been given an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and move on,” Kim wrote in The Crimson. “I would be a fool to waste it.”
Kim acknowledged that he hopes to rectify his actions by engaging in community service and work, adding that he is “committed to becoming a better person and a more selfless member of this community.” His statement explicitly addresses the Cambridge community, in addition to that of Harvard.
Kim, who wrote that he has been in counseling since the incident, also compelled students who are struggling with stress to utilize the numerous resources available at Harvard, emphasizing that seeking help is “not a sign of weakness or one of defeat.” He said he hopes his experience will serve as a “cautionary tale” for all students.
Kim’s lawyer, Allison D. Burroughs, did not respond to immediate requests for additional comment Tuesday morning.

Support for the Affordable Care Act is divided by party lines, according to a study by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and published in The New England Journal of Medicine last month.
The researchers, who examined the results of 27 public opinion polls conducted by 14 organizations, predicted low voter turnout in the midterm elections and said that changes in support for universal healthcare suggest a national cultural shift.
The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and marked one of the most sweeping instances of healthcare reform since the 1965 Medicare and Medicaid bills.
The researchers reported that 56 percent of poll respondents who said they were Republicans were in favor of repealing the act, with 27 percent saying that the act should be scaled back. Meanwhile, a majority of respondents who said they were Democrats—74 percent—said they favor moving ahead with the law, with 30 percent saying the law should be preserved and 44 percent saying the law should be expanded.
The ACA has generated a particularly long-lasting public dialogue, said Robert J. Blendon, a professor at HSPH and a co-author of the study.
“What’s really unusual about this debate is that we’re four years [after] the [Affordable Care Act] became law of the country, and people are still battling about it,” Blendon said. “Often, people spend money and have big debates before we have a law, and then it’s over. Here…the law’s been passed, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent for negative advertising to convince voters that they need to overturn this law.”
Blendon added that support for healthcare among certain groups, including the middle class, has declined in recent years.
“A surprising thing that we found was that there was a huge increase in 2002 in public support for universal coverage,” Blendon said. “However, in 2007, the majority of likely voters [were found to] no longer support the principle of universal healthcare. Something happened over the last four years, which means there’s a cultural change occurring.”
Despite this shift, William C. Hsiao, a professor at HSPH, said he was optimistic about the act’s longevity.
“Equity and fairness in health care is not of importance for a majority of Americans [today],” Hsiao said. “However, I do not expect Obamacare will be overturned or significantly scaled back because additional millions of Americans are now benefitting from it as well as many states, small firms, and low-wage businesses.”

The buzzer beat them to it.
As the No. 6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team took traveled crosstown to No. 7 Boston University on Friday night, a staunch Terriers defense kept the Crimson from sealing a win in the 60 minutes of regulation play or five minutes of overtime. The 1-1 result was the second tie of the season for Harvard.
“Their first line is about as good as anything we’re going to see this year,” junior forward Miye D’Oench said. “Shutting them down is not easy, and on top of that, to get offense going is even harder.”
It took player-advantage situations for both BU (8-3-2, 5-2-0 WHEA) and the Crimson (2-1-2, 2-1-0 ECAC) to put points on the board. Harvard’s only goal of the night was netted by D’Oench, who said her score was an early look at her team’s power play potential.
“We haven’t really gotten too many power play opportunities this season so it was nice to get a goal early and especially nice to get a power play goal early,” D’Oench said.
As Terriers sophomore forward Maddie Elia was called for checking just over six minutes into the first frame, the Crimson capitalized on the five-on-four situation. D’Oench, who has scored six goals through the first five games of the season and had a team-high of four shots this game, took a handoff from co-captain Samantha Reber and junior co-captain Michelle Picard, to get the puck past BU goalie Victoria Hanson.
The Crimson would have no such luck between the pipes for the rest of the contest, as the Terriers defense held Harvard to just 17 total shots on goal.
At the other end of the ice, junior goalkeeper Emerance Maschmeyer scrambled for 34 saves over the night.
A consistent BU offense anchored by center Marie-Philip Poulin, a front-liner who has twice scored Olympic game winners for Canada that have sent the United States home with a silver medal, sent 35 shots on goal but saw its sole goal of the night come on one of four power play opportunities.
Poulin was crucial at the face-off circle, winning 13 of her 19 attempts, and contributed four shots. However, it was her teammate Samantha Sutherland, a sophomore forward, who netted the game-tying goal. After Sutherland’s score halfway through the middle period, neither team would be able to set off the goal light for the rest of the matchup.
It was the third-straight overtime contest for the Crimson, and yet another game in which the line arrangements saw some amount of change. With an expanded roster and a plethora of talent, Harvard has yet to find the exact formula for success.
“Naturally we have a big team so things are going to be a little bit different,” senior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “At the same time we’re still trying to figure things out. No lines have been the same for any of the games we have played just far so we’re still trying to figure that out and the coaches are still trying to find the perfect mix of people.”

Give Harvard students a week to prepare for something, and you will not be disappointed with the results.
This certainly proved to be the case Saturday, when Harvard—yes, Harvard—was the talk of the college football world. Because for the first time in school history, Harvard played host to ESPN’s highly successful College GameDay program, bringing a newfound form of attention to one of football’s longest running traditions: “The Game” between Harvard and Yale.
Before the sun had even risen, Harvard and Yale students made their way to the set in bunches. In accordance with GameDay tradition, the two fan bases came equipped with homemade signs (their most important project of the week), hoping that their creativity would land them a place in the spotlight on national television.
And that it did. If ESPN had been seeking creativity, it came to the right place. Here are some of our favorite signs from Saturday.
Worthy Opponents:
Harvard was not the only one dominating the sign game. Yale students came out in full force as well—their efforts highlighted by this jeer at Crimson running back Paul Stanton.
It is no surprise that the SEC dominates the landscape of college football (GameDay is headed to its sixth SEC game in the last 10 weeks this Saturday). It is also no surprise that the Ivy League dominates the landscape of some other things…like reading.
Harvard: zero losses. Alabama: one loss. We’re pretty good at math too.
Because if anyone can compare with one of the most dangerous cities in the United States, it would have to be the Crimson’s all-time sack leader.
Prior to the legalization of the forward pass, Harvard had claimed three national championships. In its early days, the Crimson earned four more. But it has since become clear that the play has overstayed its welcome.
Mississippi State currently boasts the best red zone defense in all of college football, allowing opponents to score just 59.5 percent of the time. Impressive? Perhaps. But try telling that to Harvard admissions, allowing students to matriculate just 5.9 percent of the time.
Honorable Mention:
“Yale Cites Wikipedia”
“No One Picks Yale if they Can Pick Harvard”
“Yale Uses Bing”
“Harvard is #cos(2pi)”
“I Took the SAT for Jameis”
“Yale Kids Wear Crocs”

With three wrestlers placing in their respective weight classes, Harvard wrestling put on a solid showing at the annual Keystone Classic in its second individual tournament of the season.
“We use this tournament to figure out parameters for where we are and what we need to do from here on out, how practice is going,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We wanted to see guys stepping up and that’s what they did. Some guys did really well and other guys need to do some work, which is good going into this time of year.”
For junior Josh Popple, the tournament was about resiliency in the face of early setbacks. Popple fell to Rider’s Donald McNeil, 12-6, in his very first match of the day. Following this setback, Popple continued on to win three straight matches until he found himself facing McNeil again in a later round match. This time, Popple came out victorious, taking McNeil down by fall in the fourth minute of the contest.
“That was a really big win for me,” Popple said. “He beat me pretty handily the first round of the tournament, so being able to get back and win in a later round, that was a huge thing for me.”
Popple’s eventually stretched the win streak to five, getting into the 197-pound third and fourth place match, where he lost to Indiana’s Luke Sheridan.
“Josh had a great day,” Weiss said. “He was off all last year because of an injury, so he’s been getting that rust off. He got better throughout the tournament, and it was pretty impressive. He’s doing a great job, getting better everyday.”
In his sophomore season, Tyler Grimaldi also made a strong showing. Grimaldi fought past Pittsburgh’s Alexander Kall before falling in the quarterfinals to Northwestern’s Pierce Harger. In the consolation bracket, Grimaldi made it to the fourth round, where he fell to Devan Marry in a tight 11-9 decision.
Another Crimson standout was junior co-captain Todd Preston, who improved upon his results from the Binghamton Open in early November to claim first place in the 141-pound weight bracket. In the title bout, Preston maintained a lead throughout against Rider’s Chuck Zeisloft, eventually claiming the win, 3-1.
“The biggest thing for Todd is basically just that every time he goes out he needs to treat it like the national tournament,” Weiss said. “He wrestled well, he still has some growing to do. Even in the finals, I don’t think he wrestled his best but he still won, and that’s how good he is. “
Harvard’s heavyweight, David Ng, was Harvard’s third tournament placer, notching a second place finish in the 285-pound weight class. Ng managed to handily take down each of his opponents by decision until his final match of the day, where Appalachian State’s Denzel Dejournette came out victorious in the championship round with a 6-3 decision.
“I’m really proud of David’s performance yesterday,” Weiss said. “I knew going into this tournament that he was going to have a great day, just from the way he’s been training. His confidence went a long way, and he did a great job.”

Dear Harvard Community,
On behalf of our football program, I would like to thank the entire Harvard community for an incredible response to the Harvard-Yale Game and ESPN’s College GameDay being on campus last weekend. The support and energy from our community carried us to our 16th Ivy League championship and a perfect 10-0 season.
It was truly a special ending to an unbelievable fall, and we could not have done it without the support of our entire community. Our students, alumni, administrators and athletic staff are second to none, and our players, coaches and football staff appreciate the support of everyone that made their way to Dillon Quad and Harvard Stadium on Saturday.
We are truly grateful for the opportunity to showcase our program so well on a national stage. It was an amazing atmosphere the entire day, beginning with the students camped out in the morning trying to get their signs on College GameDay through the incredible ending when thousands of fans rushed the field after we defeated Yale for the eighth-straight season.
We can’t thank you enough for the incredible support that you showed us all year, and it was truly amazing to see the culmination of a perfect season at home before a sold out crowd on national television. It does not get sweeter than capping a 10-0 season at home, while our campus was the center of the college football universe last weekend.
To the students, band, cheer teams, faculty, staff and all members of our community at Harvard, THANK YOU!
Congratulations on another exciting season! Happy Thanksgiving! And Go Crimson!
Tim Murphy
Thomas Stephenson Family Coach of Harvard Football

By any statistical measure, the interception was insignificant.
Late in the fourth quarter of a home opener against Holy Cross, the Harvard football team held a 41-18 lead.Only two and a half minutes separated the hosts from a 1-0 record.
But when Crimson defensive back Scott Peters dove to pick off an errant throw from Crusaders quarterback Peter Pujals, the turnovermeant something that numbers could not convey.
For Peters, the pick was an affirmation. After not starting for his Georgia high school until senior year, not getting any recruiting offers, and not seeing any playing time his freshman year, Peters could finally celebrate in a college game with the ball in his hands.
“It was awesome,” Peters said. “[As] my teammates will tell you, I don’t have the best hands on the team…. I kind of surprised myself.”
However, it is misleading to describe Peters’ ascent from walk-on to starter as a fairy tale.
On the contrary, Peters stands out as someone who has succeeded at a variety of times and in a multitude of contests.
From all-state cellist to accomplished hurdler to defensive stalwart, Scott Peters frustrates the underdog label.
“He’s just one of those kids that’s driven in a positive way in everything he does,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “On the football field, he’s one of the toughest, most focused, and best football players we have.”
Most Crimson football players send game film before receiving an acceptance letter. For Peters, the opposite was true.
For his first three years at the Westminster Schools in Atlanta, Ga., Peters played behind a talented corps of defensive backs. His first start came as a senior in 2011, when the team named him co-captain. Despite leading Westminster with 74 tackles and earning regional honors, Peters did not compile a highlight tape until January.
“I applied to colleges without thinking of [sports] on the table,” Peters said. “I was able to choose this place without football.”
One factor that did influence Peters’ choice of college was the possibility of studying in a strong music department. Peters has played the cello since age three. When sports commitments limited rehearsal time, Peters branched into guitar.
Football did not prevent Peters from participating in musical ensembles. For seven consecutive years, Peters earned a spot in the Georgia All-State Orchestra, a selective group that culls the best student musicians from around the state. At Harvard, Peters is a music concentrator.
“A lot of people told me that I would have to eventually choose music or football, especially in college,” Peters said. “That never really happened.”
And Peters’ accomplishments at Westminster stretched beyond the gridiron and the concert hall.
During track season, Peters moonlighted as one of the top 300-meter hurdlers in the state. He finished in the top three of every senior year race, and at the Class AA state finals, he ran a personal best of 38.72 en route to second place.
However impressive, these past successes gave Peters no tangible advantage when he donned the Crimson football jersey.
“I was treated like one of the recruited players, which was awesome,” Peters said. “They felt like they needed me depth-wise.”
As a freshman, Peters logged time on the scout team; as a sophomore, he earned a special teams role and saw limited action as a defensive back. But this season is the first time that Peters has claimed a regular slot in the secondary.
“I think the biggest change in my game has been film study off the field,” Peters said. “Besides that, it’s just an overall progression.”
Peters’ new role has resulted in a  statistical explosion. After grabbing his first interception against Holy Cross, he recorded his first forced fumble a game later against Brown.
Peters ranked second among Harvard’s defensive backs this season with 47 tackles, including a monster game against Georgetown where he led the team with seven tackles.
This success mirrors the emergence of other third-year defensive backs in a relatively young secondary. In addition to Peters, juniors Asante Gibson, Sean Ahern, Chris Evans, and Jordan Becerra have experienced upticks in usage and production.
“We’ve been in the system long enough that we really feel comfortable with the schemes,” Peters said. “We’ve been in the weight room long enough…[that] we can compete.”
Even so, coaches and teammates maintain something separates Peters from the pack.
“He’s probably the smartest player I’ve ever played with,” Evans said “He can really control the secondary from back there. He knows what’s going on.”
Murphy confirms this assessment. Although the longtime coach does not remember a distinct first impression, he has come to appreciate several strengths of Peters’s game.
“He’s very athletic,” Murphy said. “He’s very physical. But beyond that, what allows him to be an exceptional defensive player is that he seems to see things in slow motion….For a kid like that, not to be recruited much by the Ivy League and then end up as a starter on a very good team—on an exceptional defensive team—that’s quite a story.”
Peters’s unique narrative found a unique conclusion this weekend in the 131st edition of The Game. After the Bulldogs got the ball back, trailing by seven in the last minute, Peters trotted out with Harvard’s defense for its final stand.
And with 10 seconds left, it was Peters who stepped in front of Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts’ pass to grab an interception, clinching the win and undefeated season.
As the stadium shook with cheers, and the Harvard bench streamed towards him, Peters lay in the middle of the field, hugging the ball. There he was, a former walk-on and current starter, clutching another Crimson victory to his chest.

For three seconds, the pass hung in the air.
Senior quarterback Conner Hempel watched from the 35-yard line. No Yale defender had pressured the throw, so Hempel could track the arc of the ball from a standing position, right arm extended towards the right pylon.
Junior runnin g back Paul Stanton bounced on his feet a few yards in front of the offensive line. If the Crimson were to lose the game, critics would find an easy scapegoat in Stanton, who had already fumbled twice in the game, once on the Bulldogs’ 12-yard line. When Hempel released the ball, Stanton was still looking for pass rushers to block.
Over 30,000 fans witnessed the trajectory of the pass from the concrete bleachers. On one side, the Yale section screamed and screamed; on the other side, the Harvard crowd waited.
The moment lasted three seconds, and junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer was running the whole time: down, out, and down again. He beat his defender and looked back for the ball, seeing if Hempel had put it where it needed to be. Then it arrived—the pass fell into his hands, the ball crossed the goal line, and the moment broke forever.
“There was a lot of noise, a lot of excitement,” Fischer said. “I was just turning around [to look] for my teammates because those were the people who helped me get through it…. Just finishing off like that, it means the world to me.”
In the 131st playing of The Game, Fischer’s last-minute touchdown provided a fulfilling ending to an afternoon of emotional twists and turnovers. Despite giving up a 17-point fourth quarter lead during a furious Yale comeback, the Crimson gutted its way to a 31-24 victory thanks to Fischer’s final catch.
“We were definitely thinking touchdown,” Hempel said. “Our coaches put us in that position every week in practice, so we know how it feels…. I had full confidence in [Fischer], that he was going to beat his man and come down with the ball.”
The slant-and-go route with a minute left was far from Fischer’s only contribution in the game.
With 2:45 left in the third quarter, Harvard coach Tim Murphy called a reverse option in which senior wide receiver Seitu Smith rolled right before tossing the ball downfield. Fischer hauled in the pass, shook off Yale defensive back Jason Alessi, and stepped into the end zone to give the Crimson a 17-7 lead.
“The last game of the season you always bring out…the trick plays, everything we’ve worked on all year,” Fischer said. “We practiced them all week and executed them perfectly.”
On the day, Fischer totaled a career and team-high 149 receiving yards on eight catches. He also rushed for 79 yards on two carries and shouldered return responsibilities without a slip-up. All told, his 264 yards of total offense was the highest mark for any Harvard non-quarterback this season.
Fischer reached this number in a variety of ways. Here he was near the end of the first half, carrying an end-around 58 yards to the Bulldogs’ 11-yard line. There he was again in the final drive, snagging not only the winning touchdown but also the 12-yard pass before the winning score. In each Crimson possession to open the half, Fischer had three targets.
Fischer’s high usage rate against Yale furthered an impressive season-long campaign. The 5’9” wide receiver recorded at least two catches in every game and finished the season with a team-high 677 yards receiving, including three 100-yard outings.
Moreover, Fischer also served as the team’s primary return man, averaging 23.7 yards per kickoff return and 9.1 yards per punt return. He added 137 yards on the ground on just 14 carries.
With one year left at Harvard, Fischer has already accumulated 1,026 receiving yards, the 13th-highest total in school history. As a sophomore, Fischer had his breakout season, recording 47.5 receiving yards a game and three touchdowns while also taking over as the primary kick returner.
However,of the 87 receptions that Fischer has totaled in his career, none can compare with the deciding one that he pulled in Saturday.
It may have taken only three seconds, but Fischer’s late score will have a permanent place in the lore of The Game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three games, the Harvard men’s basketball team (2-1) has sandwiched solid home wins around a surprising neutral-court defeat to Holy Cross. The Crimson will look to continue protecting home-court advantage when it takes on Houston (2-0) Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion. Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as the Crimson tries to stay undefeated on its current four-game homestand.
Trap Games: Before the year, much was made about Harvard’s nonconference schedule—or lack thereof. The schedule lacks the marquee games of past years, with teams like Memphis, Colorado, and St. Mary’s absent from the schedule. However, while the slate of games is not top-heavy, it carries a number of dangerous games against teams solidly in the NCAA’s middle tier. Harvard plays eight programs ranked between 65 and 165 on KenPom, with two of the Crimson’s conference opponents—Yale and Columbia—falling in the same range.
Houston carries a 2-0 record and a no. 163 ranking into Lavietes. The Cougars have a solid early road win over top-100 Murray State and took out SMU, Memphis, and UConn last year, so the team will not be intimidated by the host Crimson. Despite a ranking in the triple digits, Houston represents a stiff early season test for Harvard.
Home Sweet Home: Over the last four seasons, Harvard has turned the cozy confines of Lavietes Pavilion into a nightmare trip for opposing teams. The Crimson has lost just three times at home in its last 54 contests, a startling run of success bested by only Belmont (52-2 in the same span) and Duke (65-3).
In its three losses—to Yale (2014), Vermont (2012), and Penn (2012)—Harvard’s normally stout defense gave up an average of 71.3 points per game, allowing opponents to shoot 53.4 percent from the floor. So far this season, Harvard has yet to allow 60 points in a game and has held each opponent to below 40 percent from the floor. To pull off the upset, Houston will need to shatter those numbers.
Getting Healthy: The Crimson, which has been remarkably healthy during its four-year run, has struggled with nicks and bruises in the early going. Junior Agunwa Okolie, who received rave reviews from teammates and coaches for his preseason progress, played his first minutes of the season against Florida Atlantic before re-aggravating a previous ankle tweak. Senior Jonah Travis, a starter in the team’s first two games, was out the entire game with a concussion. Both players are key to the team’s floor spacing and depth, and their availability will be closely monitored as the team moves towards the tougher half of its nonconference schedule.

Warm, smoky, and cheesey with a little bit of crunch, the most popular sandwich at Clover, a local health-conscious restaurant chain, has a surprising hero.
Clover’s Brussels Sprout Sandwich, made with smoked cheddar and hazelnuts, is the eatery’s top-selling sandwich this time of year. Inspired by his lifelong love of the savory vegetable, Muir has been able to maintain Clover’s local commitment by buying the sprouts from regional farms. However, Clover recently posted on their company website that the sandwich’s run was coming to an end.
According to a blog post from last week,“Clover depleted our supply of local brussels. So with a heavy heart we must announce that we’re only going to have the Brussels Sprout Sandwich company-wide for another week (last day is [tomorrow] Wednesday 11/26).” Muir blamed the local shortage on the vegetable’s unsavory reputation and short growing season.
“We do things when the ingredients are in season and brussels sprouts have a short season,” Muir said. “It’s hard because people make fun of them all the time so literally the farmers stop growing them.”
Flyby wasn’t so ready to accept the facts without a comprehensive investigation. Muir said that Clover bought their Brussels Sprouts from Joe Czajkowski Farm in Hadley, Mass. I called up the farm and spoke with Mr. Joe Czajkowski himself, and he told me that in fact it has been a “magnificent” year for the sprout.
“We’re going to finish picking brussel sprouts in about a week or two,” Czajkowski said. “We have 15 acres of brussels sprouts and they were a nice crop and they sold very well but it’s not an easy crop to raise.”
Well, it seems like there are still sprouts left in the ground after all! Perhaps there was a mixup with Clover’s vegetable wholesale supplier? I got in contact with the Pioneer Valley Growers Association, who provides Clover with their brussels sprouts, to find out.
When informed that Czajkwoski’s farm still had some sprouts in the ground, Barrington admitted the possibility of a miscommunication, citing the fact that “the whole focus of the last two weeks has probably been more on Thanksgiving.”
Squash is great and all, but so is the brussels sprout sandwich! Was Clover deceiving its customers or was this all one great mix-up? When I told Clover’s Muir what I had learned, he said that the information came as a surprise.
“I’d been told that they were sending some brussels that weren’t from New England because they said they couldn’t get any more from Joe...we’ll tell them to fix that,” Muir said. “You might be responsible for the stay of execution.”
Looks like the brussels sprout sandwich has a chance at an extension thanks to this hard nosed journalist. You’re welcome, world.
