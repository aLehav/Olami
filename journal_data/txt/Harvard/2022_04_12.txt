On a stage mere feet from tables of hungry diners and eager listeners, Sam Weber performed at Club Passim on March 27. Featuring songs from his recently released album “Get Free” alongside older works, Weber’s performance was an intimate and multidimensional glance into the artist’s life.
Rows of candles adorned the walls and tables of Club Passim while guests were served food and drinks for the show. The soft lighting and energetic chatter created an inviting atmosphere, full of excitement for Weber and his opening act, The Ladles.
The Ladles — an acoustic folk pop band composed of Kate Martucci, Lucia Pontoniere, and Caroline Kuhn — first met at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Now, six years later, this concert rekindled the nostalgia of performing in the same city where their career began. Performing several songs off their latest album “Springville Sessions,” The Ladles melodically recounted friendship breakups in “The Friends You Had” and navigated struggling with anxiety and being present with others in “Sunset Pink.” Uniting banjo instrumentals with soulful lyrics, the trio set the stage for Sam Weber’s musical storytelling.
Opening with “Everything Comes True” from his 2019 album of the same name, Weber dove into the deep end of trials and tribulations encountered throughout life, from teenage rebellion to illness and relationship troubles. Weary but ending on a hopeful note, “Everything Comes True” showed off his soft vocals and narrative lyrics.
Joined by Danny Austin-Manning on the drums and Tejas Leier Heyden on the guitar, Weber went on to play “Truth or Lie,” a tranquil but powerful declaration that honesty will prevail and “it all comes to light, over time.” Referencing struggles in Weber’s life through phrases like “wading through the bullshit really is the hardest thing,” the singer emphasizes his choice to redirect his pain into songwriting.
Drawing on his own experiences adds depth to Weber’s lyrics and builds an intimate relationship with his audience. Though the themes of his music are by no means novel, the serene but emotional way with which Weber delivers his ruminations on familiar topics allows for open connection between him and his listeners.
“Get out of the Game” — a song about returning to your roots and going back to what you love at a new point in your life — was a highlight of the show. Intertwining descriptions of picturesque landscapes with bluegrass instrumentals and varying tempos, Weber tells an engaging tale of his own artistic journey. “Get out of the Game” resonates with anyone who’s ever felt unsure about their path and had a chance to rediscover what it is they truly want to do for themselves.
Sharing The Ladles’ sentimentality about being in Boston, Weber invited the opening band to join him on stage towards the end of his set. Trading in their banjo and violin to perform as Weber’s backup singers, the trio added impressive vocal range to the songs “Obligated” and “Here’s to the Future.” Sharing a similar folk core in their music, The Ladles sounded right at home performing with Weber and energetically concluded the show.
Circling back to the frustration and obstacles encountered throughout life in “Everything Comes True,” Weber’s finale “Burnout” contemplates the age-old struggle between unapologetically chasing a creative vision and catering to an external audience with the goal of financial security. With existential lyrics like “Everything you love will one day slowly decompose into nothing,” Weber makes this a universal issue and accepts his fate with the lyrics, “Won’t you burn out with me?”
Weber’s performance at Club Passim was an inside look into the world of making art and all of the ups and downs that come with it. Capturing the dynamic unpredictability of life, Weber’s mellow vocals and descriptive lyrics create a tranquil respite to acknowledge and give voice to the strife listeners face — making the performance a memorable and relatable one for his listeners.

Taylor Ashton returned to the Club Passim stage to end a six show tour run on April 4. Ashton had last come to Cambridge for a virtual live stream on May 1, 2020. This time around, the audience welcomed him back with lively in-person applause.
The cozy Club Passim stage complimented Ashton’s playful and evocative lyrics. Dressed in a loud blue and white jumpsuit and adorned with face glitter and his signature asymmetric earrings, Ashton brought his artistry to the stage before the music even began. His sound took on a special acoustic life with a guitar, bass, drum kit trio group to play his witty and touching songs.
Ashton opened the show solo, singing the first verse of “F.L.Y,” the first track on his latest album, “The Romantic,” without accompaniment. His deep voice resonated around the room as he climbed up and down octaves. With his gaze fixed above the crowd, the stage lights shimmered on the gold glitter around his eyes. “Feels like yesterday, feels like years ago,” Ashton serenaded the audience as he sang about the conundrum of passing time. Time, or “the tyranny of the big clock,” as Ashton called it in “F.L.Y,” would be the theme of the set. The song “Nicole” explored the doldrums of lost love. “Strangers” played with the strangeness of people going from strangers to lovers.
Each song was surrounded by banter and explanation. Ashton’s commitment to conversation with the audience embodied the candid spirit of the singer-songwriter. The audience walked away with more than just memories of songs, also forming newfound connections to the stories behind them.
Ashton’s interludes between songs also included plenty of lyrical meditation. His philosophic musings about time as a useful illusion were accompanied by fantasies of using honey as a healing elixir on an adventure hike and other eccentric stories. The back and forth between song and conversation broke down the audience-performer barrier and made the show intimate.
The set was filled with syncopated guitar rhythms and gentle banjo melodies. Ashton’s trademark banjo sound is characterized by his clawhammer style, unique tuning patterns, and thick nylon strings. “Pasadena,” which can be found in his Brooklyn Folk Festival performance last year, was one such song that exhibited both Ashton’s vocal range as well as his creativity in crafting clawhammer banjo melodies.
Ashton’s vocals and guitar did the work of many musicians. His rhythmic strum patterns varied between muted strikes, partial chords, and riffs syncopated with vocal melodies. His style of playing produced stark contrasts and unique sounds. The accompaniment of bass and drums embellished his individual proclivity with his instruments.
No song represented the musicality of the trio better than “Skeletons by the Sea” — a song of self-love that celebrates all human bodies. Ashton extended the live version of the song with instrumental fills and sudden stops. The group seamlessly changed tempo and dynamics for a layered performance that made the performance seem bigger than three people. The song enshrined Ashton’s wistfulness and lyrical finesse, contemplating the beauty of all people having skeletons under their skin in joking rhymes. Joy emanated from the lyrics and brought to mind visceral memories of summer days spent cooling off swimming.
Ashton closed the show with a solo performance of a song from an upcoming project. In fact, many of the songs Ashton played are still unreleased. New releases are coming soon, however. According to Ashton, there is a fully mastered album sitting in his Google Drive right now, waiting to go through the release pipeline soon. One thing is for sure: Until he returns to Cambridge, his eager fans will be on the lookout for these projects.

Few shows leave the audience with a burning desire to head to the nearest CVS and buy up milk. And yet, “The Milk Made,” an original musical by the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players and directed by Victoria H. Gong ’23 and Keagan Yap ’25, did just that. The unexpected on stage transformation of milk into a highly sought-after good is emblematic of the show as a whole. With plenty of modern humor, a crowd-pleasing, romantic plot, and complemented by phenomenal music, “The Milk Mad,” which ran between March 24 and 27 is nothing if not original.
Set in the futuristic world of a Chinese-dominated London, the musical follows a commoner whose sister is facing the struggle of being in love with “The Lady” (Katherine E. Vandermel ’25), who was set to be married to a nobleman. The Commoner (Alina S. Dong ’23), together with a group of friendly anarchists, spends the show helping her sister figure out a way to be with her true love, even though she is not a noble.
The script is certainly one of the show’s strengths, and it proves humorous despite some bumps throughout. Some of the humor is at the top of the line. For instance, the milk in question seems to have the same effect as alcohol, and the actors make entertaining movements and comments to simulate this. Though there are times when the humor felt almost forced, not fitting the scene. No matter how the jokes landed, however, the show was consistently engaging through its frequent use of Gen Z slang.
All in all, this light-heartedness stole the spotlight but at the expense of the story. The show revolved around a predictable plot and the repetitive jokes almost beggedto be replaced with dialogue meant to develop a more complex narrative.
With that being said, the music consistently shines despite the script’s highs and lows. Katherine E. Vandermel ’25 stands out with an operatic voice that cannot be missed. Perhaps the show’s biggest strength, the pit orchestra members were perfectly in synch, and the actual music complemented the storyline and the show’s atmosphere nicely.
Enjoyable as it is, though, there is no denying that the music sometimes outshines the actors, making it difficult to hear them sing. Sometimes it is simply unclear what is happening in the story — it is quite literally drowned by the singing. This effect is compounded by the scene design and might be intentional, if inconvenient to the experience of watching “The Milk Made”: There is a screen with the lyrics that requires the audience to tilt their heads down or to the side to get an idea of what is actually being sung at a given moment.
The cast managed to channel their characters and convey their feelings quite naturally throughout the show. The actors never broke character, even when they were doing humorous scenes such as being intoxicated on milk, or being stopped by a personified “stop” sign during a raid.
The scenography and costumes brilliantly complement the acting. The set of the palace had numerous vibrant colors that made the futuristic setting believable. The outfits similarly contributed to the musical’s worldbuilding slant, showing a clear distinction between the social classes that plays a crucial role in the production’s narrative. However, there might be a possible oversight when it comes to the costumes’ authenticity: The story is set in a Chinese-themed world, meanwhile, the wealthier characters are wearing Japanese-style kimonos.
While some of the show’s flaws do take away from the overall message, the purpose of the performance remains clear and the hard work pays off. “The Milk Made” is a humorous and joyful musical.

Heading into the night, the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance was already primed to make waves. Traditionally presented during the pre-show, the honor took center stage in Las Vegas as it was awarded during the telecast by none other than pop-punk icon Avril Lavigne.
Nominated alongside BTS, Coldplay, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett, and Justin Bieber and Benny Blanco, Doja Cat and SZA ended the night in victory. When Lavigne crowned the duo’s “Kiss Me More” the night’s winner, the camera panned to a hobbling SZA, who was on crutches after having broken her ankle falling out of bed the night before. Her face expressed an understandable combination of delight — this was her first Grammy Award win after an astounding 14 nominations across her career — and dismay with collaborator Doja Cat nowhere to be found.
As Lady Gaga helped carry SZA’s train to the stage, she took the microphone to playfully chastise Doja Cat when she appeared out of nowhere moments later to accept her award (“Bro, you went to the bathroom for five minutes, are you serious?”), followed by Doja Cat declaring she had “never taken such a fast piss in [her] whole life.”
In a quick tone change, Doja Cat delivered an extremely emotional acceptance speech. Tears forming in her eyes, she acknowledged the immensity of winning her first Grammy Award while claiming her more candid reaction to be out of character, as she much prefers to “downplay a lot of shit.”
These emotional remarks feel all the more noteworthy given her competitors, specifically BTS, who now have the distinction of losing this category two years in a row — their only nominations. The producers’ decision to move the award’s presentation to the main telecast could have in part been motivated by a desire to have the South Korean septet’s first Grammy win be televised, a moment that would have been rewatched and studied by the tens of millions of enthusiastic fans who have been hoping for a sign of acceptance for K-pop as a legitimate component of the American musical landscape.
Although BTS fans were certainly disappointed, Doja Cat and SZA proved themselves more than worthy of the accolade with their flirtatious and well-crafted track. They proved that they can certainly serve up both a viral and heartfelt moment by doing little more than being themselves.
Doja Cat went into the award show tied with Justin Bieber and H.E.R. for the second-most nominations with eight. Her Grammy nods encompassed rap, pop, and the general field, but she finished with a single trophy.
No one ever claimed that the Recording Academy or the Grammys were perfect, but what this chaotic masterpiece of an award presentation makes clear is that more room could certainly be devoted to honoring critically-acclaimed artists like Doja Cat and SZA — because if nothing else, it’s entertaining.

Spring has sprung! In Boston, it’s more like a second winter, but whether you prefer rainy grays or budding blooms, The Crimson has the best book recommendations for all your spring reading needs. Finals season might be getting you down, but these books are the perfect way to romanticize your life and relax with a good read. Not much of an independent reader? Here are some picks from a variety of genres to satisfy even the most discerning of bibliophiles.
For Romanticizing: Every spring reader should start with a romance. Flowers are blooming, the sun is out, and love is in the air. Romance sometimes gets a bad reputation for a lack of substance, but “Act Your Age, Eve Brown” by Talia Hibbert is full of intricate characters who confront complex familial and social issues, and plenty of swoon-worthy moments. While this book is the third in a series, it works well as a standalone novel. Plus, it is set at a bed and breakfast in England. Think: flowers, cobblestones, banter, and true love.
For When Prose Isn’t Enough: Nothing screams springtime like poetry. While Jericho Brown’s collection “The Tradition” leans heavily on flower motifs and imagery, these beautiful poems articulate the experience of a young, gay, Black man in America. It is a heart-stoppingly gorgeous collection about love, loss, safety, and worship told through a series of pastoral poems. Brown invented his own unique form of poem, the “Duplex,” which is featured heavily in this book. Even for those who don’t normally pick up poetry, this work by a Pulitzer Prize winner is worth a read.
For Rainy Days: For spring's more brooding, gloomy days, consider the spooky classic “Wuthering Heights” by Emily Brontë. This book has romance, but it is a lot more anguished and tortured than “Act Your Age, Eve Brown.” Get ready for rainy moors and high drama in this oldie-but-goodie about two families entwined in a cycle of love and violence. Sometimes spring isn’t just about the sunshine!
For Your Inner Child: For whimsy, magic, and a classic cadre of characters, consider reading (or revisiting) Lewis Carroll’s iconic “Alice in Wonderland.” The Disney animated movie is great, but nothing beats the original book in heart and absurd fun. The Audible audiobook narrated by Scarlett Johansson is a great way to read this book on the go: The actress gives each character a different fairy-tale voice that will conjure images of mushrooms, cheshire cats, and tea parties — a true spring wonderland.
For the Thespian: Reading Shakespeare in one’s free time is not for everyone, but anyone looking for a mental challenge and a relatively short play should check out “As You Like It.” The play is set in the forest of Arden (Trees! Plants! Spring!), and features a ton of cross-dressing and more than a few homoerotic undertones. While not typically considered the most complex of the Bard’s plays, it's a comedic crowd-pleaser featuring one of Shakespeare’s most actualized leading ladies. This is just a fun romp in the woods.
For the Intrigued: Someone who prefers to read non-fiction should look no further than Robin Wall Kimmerer’s “Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants.” Kimmerer, a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, has spent her entire life and career learning from the knowledge of plants and animals. Her powerful book about reciprocity with the environment as a means to heal the climate is a particularly relevant read that outlines how capitalism and acquisitiveness have thrown the natural order out of balance. A spring book that will not only leave you with a wealth of knowledge about plants and their uses, but will change your perspective on giving back to the Earth — “Braiding Sweetgrass” is truly a masterpiece.
For Realists: Continuing the plant theme, the best realistic fiction novel for this spring is “The Overstory” by Richard Powers. Often lauded as an epic about trees, in which trees are the protagonists, this book combines history, science, and masterful storytelling to capture the reality of the world’s largest living organisms. Part fable, part paean to the natural world, Powers’ novel is both entertaining and powerful. This is a more dense choice, however, so be prepared to be reading this one into the summer.
For Surrealists: “This is How You Lose the Time War” by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone is a slim novel that packs a significant punch. Written in lyric, almost poetic prose, it tells the story of an epic battle through space and time between two mysterious fighters: Blue and Red. There is a lot of garden imagery, and the plot focuses on the cycle of renewal and destruction that spring symbolizes. Nature is both the message and the medium in this twisty, surreal work of fiction.

Swanky jobs, flowing champagne, and a high-rise overlooking Tokyo’s glittering sprawl. The Japanese television series “Fishbowl Wives” uses this seemingly picturesque ecosystem to foreground a series of interlocking narratives about six women in fraying marriages.
Lifted from the eponymous manga, the show’s title evokes a pet goldfish in a rather overt metaphor for domestic constriction. Though marital entrapment is a time-old artistic premise, “Fishbowl Wives” vitalizes the motif by focusing on ordinary moments between spouses that build to indelibly fracture bonds. Particularly in its earlier episodes, the show lucidly depicts understated, realistic exchanges in which its female protagonists feel pressured to subjugate their needs and aspirations to their partners’. As it unfolds, though, the show accelerates clumsily, its initially promising nuance collapsing into grandiose, moralizing overtones. Despite its initial impulse to frustrate simplistic gender dynamics, “Fishbowl Wives” eventually returns to them.
Uniting the six women’s disparate stories is the transgression that acts as a source of both anxiety and liberation: adultery. Though all get considerable screen time, the story revolves most closely around Sakura Hiraga (Ryôko Shinohara), a compassionate yet meek woman who co-owns a franchise of successful hair salons with her abusive husband (Masanobu Andô). One night, when a fight with her husband results in a physical altercation, Sakura flees, finding refuge in a local goldfish shop managed by Haruto, a kind younger man (Takanori Iwata). Grateful for each other’s companionship, Sakura and Haruto work together at the shop, navigating the limbo between romance and friendship as they clean tanks and bag gleaming goldfish for customers. Theirs is a classic relationship, one that grows increasingly expected as the series progresses.
Despite its penchant for recycled tropes, “Fishbowl Wives” is not without its shrewd moments. Indeed, its most enjoyable scenes are the ones in which it doesn’t try to do too much — and that ultimately make believable the transgressive leaps these women take. A recurrent visual focus on domestic objects evoke melancholy, mundanity, and domestic enclosure all at once, often in a single sweep of the camera. One protagonist refuses to sleep in the same room as her husband because of her mounting bitterness toward his emotional insensitivity. Camping out on their living room couch, she drifts each night, drunk, into a shallow sleep. The camera pans to the table adjacent to the bed, strewn with empty chip bags and crumpled cans of beer. It is by evoking these ordinary miseries — infused with interior histories of unresolved longing — that the show reaches its aesthetic and affective apex.
The show’s choice to make adultery the central catalyst for female self-discovery is provocative yet fraught. In its defense, it demonstrates clear double standards. While Sakura’s husband’s ongoing infidelity is regarded apathetically as an open secret, a photograph of Sakura embracing Haruto in the rain becomes the talk of the high rise, sparking ire and eventually physical violence from her husband.
Through adultery, the show’s protagonists awaken a dormant part of themselves. Yet the centrality of cheating in the storyline suggests the women’s transformations are dependent on the entry of new men into their lives. Notably, none of the women is able to independently act on her marital discontent. It is only when another man enters their lives that their distress is thrown into sharp enough relief that they will themselves to disrupt the despair of their current lives. Does this dynamic suggest the women’s departure from their marriages is not a transformative step forward, but rather a new iteration of the same problem? The show remains ambiguous around these tensions.
At times, it is difficult to discern whether this ambiguity is a calculated move or a careless one. Regardless, it is realistic, demonstrating the dangers of leaning too heavily on a relationship for personal transformation. Perhaps by emphasizing the centrality of adultery in these women’s shifting conceptions of themselves, the show posits that only through an arresting attraction for another person can someone awaken to the mediocrity of their current reality. It’s hard not to wish that what fractured the stiff veneer of these women’s lives, though, was not an attraction towards new men, but rather a conviction within themselves.

If chaotic good was a movie, it’d be Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Starring on-screen powerhouses Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis, A24’s newest sci-fi action comedy depicts one woman’s epic adventure through the multiverse to save her daughter from an all-consuming everything bagel.
Produced in part by directors Anthony and Joseph Russo, known for their films set in the Marvel multiverse, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” combines the action-packed drama and grand proportions of modern superhero movies with the odd but surprisingly tender surreal comedy that the Daniels (as writer-director duo Kwan and Scheinert like to refer to themselves) have a knack for. Their 2016 film “Swiss Army Man” features Daniel Radcliffe as an overly-flatulent corpse, and their newest title continues in the duo’s tradition of offbeat comedy.
The film opens with chaos: Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), an overwhelmed matriarch who runs a laundromat with her sweet, even-tempered husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), is arranging a Chinese New Year Party for her customers on the same day that the laundromat gets audited by the IRS. Adding an extra load to Evelyn’s overfilled washer — it had to be done — Evelyn’s demanding and traditional father Gong Gong (James Hong) arrives from China, and her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) wants to introduce her girlfriend to him at the party.
During an IRS meeting with the formidably eerie bureaucrat Deirde (Jamie Lee Curtis), Evelyn is initiated into the rules of the multiverse by an alternate reality version of her husband, who urges Evelyn to help defeat the powerful but unstable Jobu Tupaki, creator of a black-hole bagel capable of destroying the multiverse. And so the adventure begins for both Evelyn and the audience in a storyline whose strands are as complex and manifold as the number of alternate realities in the movie. Suffice to say, the Daniels’ multiverse is crazy in a way that only the creators of a sentient flatulent corpse could come up with. It parodies “Ratatouille” in a live-action raccoon version imagined by Evelyn, reverently imitating scenes from Wong Kar-wai’s “In the Mood for Love.” It features worlds where everyone has hot dogs for fingers, and where Evelyn and her daughter Joy are mute stones in a canyon speaking to each other via Times New Roman typescript.
In all respects, the movie lives up to the expectations set by its title. It seems as if every department in the production team was directed to operate with maximalist sensibility. Replete with frenetic cinematography, smartly and comedically choreographed fight scenes, jam-packed set design, and kooky, referential costumes, all of the film’s visual components converge into a dizzying but sensational kaleidoscope that threatens to overstimulate the senses in the best way possible. Son Lux, an American experimental band, is the perfect choice to compose the film’s jarringly primal soundtrack. Watching and listening to “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is the closest a viewer might get to being a kid in Willy Wonka’s candy shop.
Michelle Yeoh gives an unsurprisingly dynamic performance as a smartly comedic, realistically hassled, and ultimately loving maternal protagonist. Stephanie Hsu nails both the resigned helplessness of depressed Joy and the terrifying despair of nihilistic Jobu Tupaki. Quan’s Waymond is remarkably resonant despite his character’s tendency to be used as the “Be kind” hippie messenger for the more pessimistic female figures in his life. And let’s not forget the multiverse, which is just as much a character in the movie as its inhabitants. What the Daniels uniquely succeed in doing in their latest film is portraying both the colorful wonders and dismal betrayals of their multiverse. If every decision is a viable possibility manifested by the infinite number of alternate realities, then why does any decision matter? The movie astutely reminds the audience that Jobu Tupaki’s destructive nihilism is just as much a product of the multiverse as the (intentionally misspelled) “Racacouille.”
Distill the movie into its purest element, however, and what the audience gets is a very simple, tender family drama. The film’s genius lies in its ability to track one woman’s sense of individual loss — of her dreams, her ambitions, her self — as it morphs into an exploration of her relationships with her family members. The film begins as an exciting, lone-ranger/chosen-one journey in which Evelyn gets to fulfill her what-if fantasies in alternate realities. It transforms, albeit a tad too slowly, into her reckoning with the fact that the very people who ground her in the tedium of her dismal reality at the laundromat are the ones who enable her fantastical journey through the multiverse. The movie is Evelyn’s psyche visualized, dyed in a million brilliant colors and placed in a million brilliant sets, and it is a truly beautiful moment when her psyche ends up back at the place it started: with Joy and Waymond in the parking lot of their laundromat. The touching end of the rollercoaster ride that is “Everything Everywhere All at Once” persuades viewers that being on the ground isn’t so bad after all.

“When everything is illuminated and the shadows have been sanitized, where goes the creature inside and what happens to her need for reverie?” writes Claire-Louise Bennett in her latest book. Part autofiction of a young writer, part philosophical encounter with humanity’s inherent and misconstrued darkness, and part subtle but raging feminist outcry, “Checkout 19” is nothing short of astounding. Bennett’s stream-of-consciousness prose draws the reader in like a maelstrom, taking one to the powerful “unmapped realm” of the writer’s vivid imagination in which she creates both her characters and her own identity. The novel masterfully shows us why we need stories to live and blurs the line between reality and imagination. Simultaneously, it illustrates the dangers of losing oneself in fantasy and protecting one’s intrinsic darkness at the expense of ignoring the darkness in the real world.
On the surface, “Checkout 19” is a coming-of-age novel about a young female writer in the English countryside. Told in retrospect, Bennett portrays the events, people — real and imagined — and books that have shaped and inspired her to live a life dedicated to reading and writing. Despite the straightforward premise, the novel defies constraints or easy classifications in every way. Bennett frees her prose from grammatical norms and limitations, and her narrator’s mind from fully formulated thoughts and conclusions. The realistically digressive thoughts of her unnamed narrator — who switches between “I,” “we,” and “she” — take the reader on an exhilarating ride through Florence, repressing classrooms, Tangier, and burning libraries in a work unbound by space and time.
The novel’s liberating formal aspects are intrinsically tied to its message of literature as a transcendental gateway into the deeper human consciousness and imagination. Throughout the book, the narrator reveals that this deep-seated part of the mind is a place that defies definition: She sometimes calls it “world soul,” sometimes an “alluring and unmapped realm,” but most often accepts that we can know nothing for sure about such a place. Philosophy aside, the most obvious reason for the elusive nature of the human mind and imagination is the fact that it is certainly different for every individual. A main characteristic of the inner mind for the novel’s protagonist is “darkness,” a term to which she attaches no negative meaning but rather sees it as an indispensable fountain of human creativity that should not be separated from “lightness.” Bennett’s musings here call to mind the recent psychological concept of “toxic positivity,” which views the suppression of emotions that traditionally carry negative associations, such as sadness or anger, as unhealthy and stifling.
As the narrator grows up and develops this undefinable sphere, her imagination increasingly serves as a perfectly private and secret place to escape the hurtful limitations of the real world. When the narrator muses, “I sometimes wonder if my inclination for abstruse ideas wasn’t in fact a form of passive-aggression,” she ascribes to her stories a nature of both surrealism and societal criticism. She feels trapped in the school and town she grows up in, where she is ridiculed for her unconventional thoughts. Even the London university where she later studies literature imposes a canon upon her and thereby confines her creative spirit.
Most distressfully, the violence and discrimination she faces because of her gender simultaneously almost quench and fuel her creative ingenuity. A book about electroconvulsive therapy that was used on women in her family rouses in her an “inherent anger that was ancient and bloodthirsty.” Isn’t it perfectly obvious, she thinks, that a culture in which women are “belittled, undermined, ignored,” and “misinterpreted on and on” makes them mad?
The narrator herself has to fight for her standing as a female writer, particularly with her romantic partners: “Women can’t withstand poetry, seemed to be Dale’s view… Poetry rips right through you, makes shit of you, and a man can be made shit of and go on living because no one really minds, not even the man.” It is then all the more satisfying when she realizes that, despite her misogynistic surroundings, beauty and weakness are not a woman’s defining characteristics, and that her irrepressible talent lacks no fierceness, wit, or resilience whatsoever. “Checkout 19” intersperses sharp but subtle observations of microaggressions and lets the protagonist grapple with them in an often unsatisfyingly internal way. Even after she becomes the victim of sexual violence, she uses literature and writing as a remedy instead of confronting the perpetrator. This does not take away from the novel’s feminism at all, but rather realistically illustrates the consequences of a culture of victim-blaming.
As the story moves on, the narrator slowly comes to terms with what she has tried to circumvent at all costs: reality. Thus far, Bennett has pulled the reader into the protagonist’s vivid imagination, praising stories as a sweet escape from the grim facts of existence. She easily could have ended the novel on this note. Instead, fitting with the novel’s refusal of black-or-white portrayals, the author holds the mirror up to both her protagonist and the reader by reminding us of reality’s challenges and darknesses. Startled, the reader realizes they have fallen for Bennett’s addicting prose just like the protagonist lives only through the literature she reads and writes. Merging with her creations, she is consumed by her literary work and loses her grip on reality, and the reader only recognizes this when it is almost too late. Bennett’s self-aware reflection shrewdly warns one of these dangers that inevitably accompany the benefits of storytelling.
Leaving many of its issues and questions unsolved, “Checkout 19” is a multi-layered and rewarding novel that will reverberate in the reader’s mind and nudge them to find their own way of balancing imagination and reality, lightness and darkness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 1934 in Alabama, and a Black man named Tom Robinson (Yaegel T. Welch) is on trial for a crime he did not commit. He faces a jury of entirely white peers and will face the electric chair if convicted. So begins “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which runs from April 5 to 17 at the Citizens Bank Opera House.
The show, after debuting this past November on Broadway, is now embarking on its first national tour. Based on Harper Lee’s 1960 novel of the same name, the play tells the story of the trial and highlights the lives of the defense attorney Atticus Finch (Richard Thomas) and his children, Jim (Justin Mark) and Scout (Melanie Moore). The adaptation manages to capture the very essence of the novel and it skillfully grapples with the age-old question: Who deserves to be treated with respect?
The play puts an interesting spin on the source material — the scenes jump around from place to place in a non-linear fashion, often returning to the courthouse. Moreover, it does a wonderful job of reshuffling the most important moments of the novel into a well-paced sequence that highlights the main tensions of respect, innocence, and racial injustice, all the while showcasing the nuances of these issues. The non-linear timeline allows for contrasting scenes to be pitted right up against each other, enabling the audience to see many sides of the complicated narrative.
One of the play’s greatest strengths is its ability to showcase a wide variety of emotions by including several humorous and childish moments along with the somber, serious, and sad ones. The jokes, delivered perfectly with the right amount of pause and emphasis, often have the audience roaring with laughter. Dill (Steven Lee Johnson) and Calpurnia (Jacquline Williams) in particular nail their executions, Dill with his boyish energy and Calpurnia with her no-nonsense deadpan eliciting loud chuckles.
Aside from the humor, the show also nails its delivery of emotional scenes and pivotal moments convincing enough to move anyone in the audience. These moments are often punctuated by a weighty sentence deftly capturing the essence of the situation at hand. Calpurnia and Tom Robinson, who feature in many of these moments, are welcomed additions to the original storyline which adds greater depth to the situation.
While the play overall stays true to the original story, the onstage Atticus Finch is different from the book protagonist people have grown to love and respect. He is not the perfect person he is sometimes made out to be: He is portrayed as a bit naïve with his idea that everyone, no matter what they think or have done, deserves respect. What's more, he fails to understand the extent of the prejudice Tom Robinson and Calpurnia face. In some aspects this is a welcomed change, which makes for a much more realistic portrayal and adds further color to the issues the play explores. No one in the story is entirely right in their beliefs, illustrating the real-life complexity of such situations. However, some tenderness between him and his children — arguably one of his best and most loved traits — are lost.
Visually, the show is incredible. The sets offer phenomenal depth; the scenes set in the house manage to create both an inside and outside world. Alongside lighting and costumes, it perfectly complements the mood of the scenes and transforms the stage into the 1930s Alabama of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” The set transitions are very smooth and natural, with the acting seamlessly carried through. The final house scene, which caps off the show flawlessly, is emblematic of the show’s strengths. Despite featuring many characters, it manages to portray their interactions naturally without overwhelming the audience. The characters are able to move from within the room in the house to the outside, creating an effect where Scout (Melanie Moore) is inside the house explaining certain events to a group but also able to slip out during her story and act out the events for the audience, all the while telling her story without missing a beat.
Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird” masterfully delivers a new look on a classic tale. There is never a dull moment in the show and every scene and every character is an integral part of the narrative. The story artfully tackles serious, relevant questions, and the cast delivers brilliantly, making this run of the show a must-watch.

It’s no secret that remakes and series based on true stories dominate modern television: No beloved ‘90s show or shocking news story from recent years is safe from the greedy grasp of television executives. And while these shows can turn out to be great works in their own right, they lack novelty. Apple TV +’ new series “Severance,” which completed its first season on April 8, faces no such problem and serves as a convincing argument for the merits of completely original content. This gripping science fiction thriller is one of television’s most ingenious, visually stunning, and well-rounded new series.
“Severance” takes place in an alternate universe where regular humans who work for Lumon Industries, a menacing tech company, can decide to “sever” their work and home lives by having a computer chip implanted in their brains. By doing this, these people are unable to access any of their memories from home while at work and vice versa. The premise reads much like an episode of “Black Mirror,” but “Severance” far exceeds this predecessor by allowing its characters and world to develop over the course of an entire season.
Prior to even noticing the show’s masterful performances, viewers will most likely be struck by its unique set design. The show’s creators toss the image of the modern American office out the window, opting instead for an underground complex of large and mostly empty green-carpeted rooms connected by a maze of stark white hallways. This minimalist design, combined with the retro technology that characters use to do strangely mundane work, adds a sinister layer to every on-screen workday: If this company has the technology to sever thoughts, why does the office look so old-fashioned? Where do all the hallways lead to? All of these questions and more will constantly unsettle viewers, never allowing them to believe Lumon’s idyllic facade.
“Severance”’s main protagonist is Mark Scout, played by Adam Scott of “Parks and Recreation” fame. While Scott occasionally delivers some wry remarks reminiscent of a network sitcom, he mainly displays his impressive dramatic chops in what is easily his most impressive performance to date. The slow transformation in his facial expressions and body language from peppy corporate shill to concerned office deviant over the course of Season One is a marvel to watch. Scott even manages to manipulate the tenor of his character’s voice, to the point where there is a noticeable difference between his meek office “innie” and sarcastic home “outie.” Essentially, Scott manages to play two completely different characters while occupying the same exact body, a truly impressive feat.
Besides Scott, “Severance” also has some heavy-hitting talent in Patricia Arquette, John Turturro, and Christopher Walken. All three acting veterans turn out amazing performances, with Arquette’s mix of soft-spokenness and unbridled aggression making her a spine-chilling villain. Turturro, however, is the stand-out of the bunch as the fiercely obedient Irving. While his character is a man of few words, Turturro still manages to embody Irving’s internal struggles and victories in a way that will make viewers gravitate toward him. Plus, he imbues his budding relationship with Walken’s character with an impressively high level of tenderness and believability.
Lesser-known actors such as Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, and Tramell Tillman round out this solid ensemble with their own unforgettable flourishes. Much of “Severance’s” brilliance lies in its ability to keep viewers hooked with its mysterious, multi-layered plotline while at the same time never failing to present an array of three-dimensional characters whom the audience can relate to and adore.
In the technical realm, “Severance” continues to deliver on all fronts. Cinematographers Jessica Lee Gagné’s and Matt Mitchell’s camerawork is especially notable, with long and smooth tracking shots occasionally being interrupted by jarring tremors at particularly suspenseful moments. The difference in lighting between the worlds of home and work — with the former being gloomy and the latter oppressively bright — is yet another clever way the show immerses viewers in the disorienting severed experience. These creative decisions are often guided by the steady hand of Ben Stiller, who directed six episodes of the series.
Whether or not viewers fancy themselves fans of science fiction, “Severance” will not disappoint. There’s something for every type of fan, from dry workplace humor to the unsolvable question of Lumon’s greater purpose (which somehow involves baby goats?). All of this culminates in one of the more fascinating, stomach-turning, and gasp-inducing season finales in recent memory.
So for every person who spends their days at work watching the clock and wishing they could skip forward to their time at home, “Severance” relays a terrifying warning: Be careful what you wish for.

The sixth season of STARZ’s hit series “Outlander” premiered on March 6, ending two years of what fans dubbed “droughtlander.” This season, based on the sixth novel in Diana Gabaldon’s “Outlander” series, follows beloved leads Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) as they navigate their new life in the American colonies, facing mounting tensions in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War.
Similar to previous seasons, “Outlander” Season Six succeeds in completely immersing viewers in the time period at hand. Whether it was 1940s England, 1970s Boston, or in this case, 1770s North Carolina, the combination of set design, costuming, and character-driven writing makes the story believable and fully engaging. The show effectively navigates the complexities of Brianna (Sophie Skelton), Roger (Richard Rankin), and Claire’s knowledge of the future, highlighting their struggles and successes assimilating to a time they were previously familiar with only from textbooks.
At the beginning of the season, all is well on Fraser’s Ridge, the family’s settlement: Claire is back to work in her clinic, Brianna is bringing modern inventions to the 18th century, and the settlers are prospering. It quickly becomes evident, however, that conflict is imminent. The happy dynamic is quickly interrupted by flashbacks to Jamie’s harrowing years at Ardsmuir Prison following the failed Jacobite Rebellion and the arrival of fellow inmate Tom Christie (Mark Lewis Jones) on the Ridge.
The arrival of Christie and his group of staunch Protestants immediately presents a challenge to Jamie. Ever the peace-maker and leader, Jamie sets aside their previous differences and welcomes Tom, even aiding the new settlers in building their cabins. The interactions between Claire and Tom, however, are more compelling; Claire’s quick retorts to Tom’s misogynistic comments offer a moment of comic relief to an otherwise heavy show. In episode two, Claire responds to Tom’s comments: “Clearly Saint Paul also met a woman he couldn’t out-argue.”
Besides the ideological differences explored through Christie’s arrival, the first few episodes of Season Six also explore individual characters' attempts to heal following the traumatic events of the Season Five finale. In the dramatic final episode, pregnant Marsali (Lauren Lyle) was beaten and Claire was kidnapped and raped by Lionel Brown (Ned Dennehy). The overuse of sexual violence is a serious issue on the show, and one that seemed to be too quickly forgotten in previous seasons. In this season, Marsali’s husband Fergus (César Domboy) appears to struggle more with the attack than Marsali herself: he falls into alcoholism and attempts suicide, plagued with guilt about not protecting his wife.
Claire also struggles to cope with the immense trauma she experienced despite putting on a brave face for her husband and family, a departure from how previous seasons have addressed rape. She continues to practice medicine, but misuses the anesthetic she created for surgeries, putting herself to sleep when she is reminded of her trauma. This storyline falls flat at times, as it not only seems at odds with Claire’s character but ultimately pushes her experience to the side. “I’m fine, darling,” is Claire’s response in episode one when Brianna brings up the subject, and little changes in subsequent episodes.
This season also continues to explore the relationship between colonists and nearby Native American tribes, a storyline established in previous seasons, when Jamie accepts the role of Indian Agent, a sort of litigator between the crown and the Native leadership. When Jamie learns that Richard Brown (Chris Larkin), the Fraser’s rival and brother of the man who kidnapped and raped Claire, is the alternative candidate, he tells the Governor, “If it’s between me and him, I cannae let him do it.”
Because of Jamie’s diplomatic role with the Cherokees, he and Young Ian (John Bell) must travel frequently to speak with leaders, opening a discussion of Ian’s time with the Mohawk. Both viewers and Ian’s family finally learn more about his experience as a member of the Mohawk tribe, as well as his marriage. He struggles to reconcile his conflicting affiliations, which is a genuinely moving part of the show. Ian is one of the most caring and empathetic characters in the cast, and the episode exploring his story is an engaging one.
Young Ian looks up to his uncle, Jamie, who is almost exhaustingly good in this season. It seems as though he cannot misstep, somehow always taking the lead and saving the day. Despite this characterization of Jamie as eternally good feeling a bit unrealistic, it works. The audience grows to share the same belief as Claire: When Jamie is there, things will work out. This is what makes Malva Christie’s (Jessica Reynolds) claim that she is pregnant with Jamie’s child in episode six so jarring to the audience — it is entirely at odds with Jamie’s character. The showrunners force everyone to question Jamie’s faithfulness, ultimately affirming it.
Jamie’s characterization is also challenged by his political affiliations. In the first parts of the season, it feels wrong that Jamie cooperates with the British government, especially given his knowledge of the impending war’s outcome. This tension is finally resolved in episode f]ive when Jamie joins the Sons of Liberty, immediately singling himself out as a leader in the group. His monologue at the meeting exemplifies the qualities many fans love about Jamie, and serves as a reminder of his background as a leader of the Jacobite Rebellion.
The pace of the season picks up considerably after this pivotal moment as the various plotlines become overshadowed by impending war. The mounting tensions in the colonies finally reach the previously separated Fraser’s Ridge just as Malva’s accusations sow doubt in the community, and Jamie is forced into action. The return of old favorite Lord John Grey (David Berry) further calls back to the urgency and intensity of previous seasons as John raises the stakes of Jamie’s involvement in the rebellion.
Even in its lulls, “Outlander” is impossible to stop watching. The chemistry between its leads, beautiful costume design, and compelling historical setting make it an engaging escape from reality. Even so, it would benefit from further exploration of its many characters’ deep traumas, especially before they are plunged into war.
Outlander is streaming on STARZ. The finale will air on April 24.

Move aside, Harvard Confessions — there’s a new anonymous posting board that is taking campus by storm. Amongst the social networking sites popular on campus, the latest to emerge is an app called Sidechat.
Designed to help college students connect with their classmates, Sidechat allows its users to share memes, jokes, and confessions on a Reddit-style forum with those who attend the same school. Students sign up through their university email, which grants them access to their college specific forum. Once signed on, users can view, react to, and create their own posts. They can also respond to other’s posts and start private messages with other users. The catch? Everyone's identity remains completely anonymous — reminiscent of a previously popular social media application, Yik Yak.
Yik Yak was immensely popular among college students back in 2014. Similar to Sidechat, Yik Yak allows users make and view anonymous posts on a forum. However, Yik Yak’s discussion threads are visible to everyone within a five mile radius of each other, regardless of university affiliation. Sidechat, on the other hand, allows students to feel greater privacy and attachment to the space as an exclusively college-oriented one.
Harvard’s Sidechat forum has been getting quite a bit of traffic in the past few weeks — a steady stream of new content is added during most hours of the day, with occasionally over 30 new posts per hour. Posts can rack up hundreds of upvotes in a few hours, and users can view filters for the most popular posts under the “Top” and “Hot” tabs of the app.
The forum functions as an extension of social life on campus, or rather, a special corner for students to connect beyond the physical spaces offered. It allows students to stay up to date on jokes and trends as well as contribute to campus culture. Most posts feature memes and jokes unique to Harvard, often making fun of a range of topics from student-athlete quirks to the Quad-Yard commute. Posts also center around discussion of current events happening on campus, such as the dissolution of the UC and Yardfest. Meta posts have also evolved, featuring jokes about the kinds of jokes on the platform.
The desire of students to post anonymous messages to their peers is not new. Like Sidechat, Harvard Confessions, a Facebook page, allows students to submit anonymous messages. In contrast with Sidechat, Harvard Confessions must go through a form from which the administrators choose what to post, filtering out confessions which violate community guidelines. The page is public for all to see, and anyone can send in messages. Harvard Confessions clearly shows a demand for an anonymous posting board: The page features more than 11,000 confessions from the past three years.
Because the posting on Harvard Confessions is not instantaneous, the confessions tend to be released in large batches at random times. Furthermore, the easiest way to respond to a post is to reply publicly, so only one direction of communication is anonymous. Sidechat resolves both of these issues and has seen much higher levels of engagement among users.
If Sidechat manages to take off across the country, it would not be the first time a social media service has found its start on a college campus. Containing a dense group of interconnected individuals, college campuses are ripe grounds for trends to spread. Most notably, Facebook began as a site for college students to communicate with each other.
For now, Sidechat remains a niche platform for college students. Only time will tell if it will manage to expand beyond that, or if it will stay just another fad.

Not only are the Grammys one of the most important nights of the year for the music industry, but they are also a time for celebrities and fashionistas to flaunt their best looks. The Grammys red carpet is known for out-of-the box style choices from the biggest names in fashion. This year’s ceremony did not disappoint. Here are some of the best looks from the 2022 Grammys:
Lady Gaga: Lady Gaga is the undisputed empress of fashion. She is notorious for having worn a dress made of raw meat, among other daring style choices. When she serves, she serves a full meal, and this Grammys look does not disappoint. While this fit is not as avant-garde as some of the ones that made her an icon, her black and white Armani Privé gown accentuated with Tiffany & Co. diamonds is classic Hollywood glamour at its finest. She looks poised, polished, and put together.
Lil Nas X: The “Montero” rapper delivered a white Balmain suit encrusted with pearls that pays homage to Rock and Roll icon Elvis Pressley. Lil Nas X’s outfit goes the extra mile with a giant embroidered butterfly, matching platform boots, and tasteful blue eye makeup. It is a perfect example of the mix of classy, campy, and unapologetically queer that the artist has become known for.
Japanese Breakfast: Japanese Breakfast’s Michelle Zauner’s Valentino Haute Couture mini popped on the red carpet with its bold yellow hue. Twitter users playfully pointed out that the textured detailing of the dress looks like potato chips. The look is fresh, noteworthy, and stylish, just like the “Best New Artist” nominee herself. Rounded out with twin pearl-accented top knots and white platform heels, Zauner’s look is one of the most memorable of the night.
Billie Eilish: Like Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish is known for outside-the-box outfits. While this Rick Owens deconstructed trench coat getup is not the most creative we have seen from her, it channels Eilish’s trademark effortless cool. The sock-boots, sunglasses, and coat-dress come across as polished despite the dark tones and draping fit.
Saweetie: Saweetie made a big splash at this year’s Grammys in not one, but two red carpet looks. Her first, a hot pink Valentino two-piece is a modern spin on a classic silhouette. The boxy bra-top with an eye-catching bow and the over-the-elbow gloves are both charming and sexy, and the glitzy choker, earrings, and bracelets pull the ensemble together. The second outfit, a black Oscar de la Renta with a black ruffled skirt and a jeweled bodice, however, was a bit plain and uninspired in comparison to her stellar Valentino appearance.
BTS: The most popular band in the world did not disappoint. Dressed in coordinated suits designed by Louis Vuitton, the band popped in their outfits’ unusual color palette. The unique combinations of beige, white, maroon, navy, teal, and lilac emphasize each member’s personal style while keeping the group’s overall look classy and streamlined. With not a tousled strand of hair out of place, the pop powerhouse band’s Grammys look is picture-perfect.

Complete with music from composers ranging from Mendelssohn to John Williams, quips about the Undergraduate Council, a turkey attack, and a heartwarming tale of three professors navigating the dangerous waters of academia, the Harvard Pops Orchestra’s spring concert “Pops and the Island of Misfit Professors” offered much entertainment for those in attendance.
Harvard Pops Orchestra is a symphonic orchestra fusing a variety of music, including student-written pieces, with singing, acting, and filmmaking. Held in Lowell Lecture Hall on April 2, this spring’s concert had three Harvard professors on a quest for tenure travel to a mysterious island where they encounter feisty animals, evil Colleagues, and a magical artifact. Harvard Pops Orchestra’s unique concept, according to co-president Skye G. Park ‘24, is “theatrical music.”
“We don’t refer to our concerts as ‘concerts,’ we call them ‘shows’ because though it is focused on the orchestra and the music that we choose, we also have a script and actors running alongside the orchestra throughout the show,” said Park.
In addition to acting and a setlist that includes movie soundtracks, classical pieces, musical theater, and funk rock, Pops shines in its comedic timing. “I appreciate the jokes a lot, and that it’s not just straight songs,” said audience member Margaret L. Woo ‘25 of “The Island of Misfit Professors.”
The show’s plot focused on three professors, acted and sung by Nikita Nair ‘24, Jacob K. Ostfeld ‘23, and Kyra S. Siegel ‘25, who must make a “wicked awesome discovery” to get tenure at Harvard. After concluding in Disney’s “How Far I’ll Go” that they would rather choose a dangerous adventure over the alternative consulting career, the trio takes a rowboat to the Island of Misfit Professors while the orchestra accompanies them with the majestic “Raiders March” from Indiana Jones.
“The island,” Park said, “is an idealized, perfect utopia of academia. Women are treated as equals, people of color are not misrepresented or discriminated against.”
The three professors then meet Dr. Awesome and Professor Cool, performed by pianists Forrest G. Flesher ‘21 and Rachel Guo ‘22. They are misfit professors already on the island, which comes to life through “Highlights from Jurassic Park,” who are trying to find a mysterious artifact that will grant any academia-related wish. While the hall is suffused in disquieting red lighting and the orchestra begins the seething first measures of Gustav Holst’s “Mars: The Bringer of War,” the misfit professors reveal their evil plan to the audience. After engaging the trio in their quest, they aim to betray them and achieve academic world domination — which includes outlawing the Oxford comma. Simultaneously, tensions arise among the three protagonists as each is tempted to keep the artifact for themselves, leading them to split up.
The theme and setlist of each Pops concert are decided on collectively by the orchestra members.
“Usually, we’ll have a setlist and then we’ll frame a story around it,” said creative team leader Bryce C. Reynolds ‘24. “We usually have something that’s Harvard-related and doesn’t get talked about a lot amongst students.”
In this show, “we get to see that other side of the academia world,” said Reynolds. Clearly, this side would benefit just as much as the students would from less competitiveness and discrimination and more respect and friendship.
In the “Finale,” all hell breaks loose when the animals (read: orchestra members with fishtails and turkey masks) and professors run around Lowell Lecture Hall, engaging the audience in the thrill of the chase sequence.
Outrunning the animals, they get hold of the artifact and use their wish to return to Harvard. In front of ‘His Regal Harvardness,’ acted by David J. Peters ‘25, they explain that their ‘wicked awesome discovery’ is that they are really good friends. Instead of pursuing tenure at Harvard, they start their own university which will feature good TF payment, respect, and a student government email account with better password security.
According to Woo, the jokes of Pops concerts work because they’re accessible to all. Everyone “can understand them and they’re up to date. The UC election literally happened a couple days ago,” Woo said.
Spontaneity and surprises are an indispensable part of the Pops experience. “We get the script fully fleshed out and then send an email saying, ‘the script is ready for joke-insertion.’ The jokes happen right before the concert,” Reynolds said.
It’s not only the audience who gets surprised, either. “As much as we rehearse, we never actually fully run through the show with the full script and actors, so orchestra members are just as much immersed in the show experience as audience members. When we laugh at jokes, we’re genuinely laughing because we’ve never heard the jokes before,” Park said.
The plot of the silent film, the jokes, and the traditional dance piece at the end are all kept secret from the orchestra for as long as possible, resulting in a unique final product. “On stage, in the moment, everything just kind of magically comes together,” Park added.

“To all those whose brains will decompose before their hearts,” reads the opening scene of “Vortex,” Gaspar Noé’s 140-minute reflection on mortality. Utilizing unique cinematography with dual perspectives, the film immerses viewers in the lives of an elderly couple struggling to fight their descent into old age. Confrontational and raw, “Vortex” beautifully captures the experience of aging, illness, and death through its minimal dialogue and forceful storytelling.
Inspired by his own brain injury, Noé’s film follows a former psychiatrist falling deeper into a dementia diagnosis as her husband, an author, grapples with a worsening heart condition. Each occupying their own half of a frame, the screen cleaved by a black line down the center, the husband and wife go about their routines. This split-screen diptych presents dual perspectives on events shared by the couple, delivering a fuller story and ultimately letting the viewers choose what elements they focus on.
Noé’s use of dialogue in “Vortex” is limited, letting the couple’s actions subtly say the things they can’t bring themselves to openly discuss. While most people may feel compelled to sweep issues of injury and old age under the rug, Noé confronts this desire within viewers and within his characters by depicting the futility of holding on to youth. Privy to the relationship between a sentimental husband who refuses to leave his home full of nostalgia-inducing books and a wife clinging on to her lifestyle as a psychiatrist by prescribing herself medication, viewers plainly see the ineffectual desperation to prolong youth reflected back at them. In addition to commentary on aging in our current society, Noé makes several startling remarks about movies and dreams.
“Movie theaters are the best place to expose your dreams,” muses the husband, subtly breaking the fourth wall. Citing the privacy, darkness, and focused attention present in theaters, this attempt at conversing directly with the audience is sadly never developed further within the main narrative, a missed opportunity for Noé.
“Vortex” includes the oftentimes overlooked perspective of families and children in its discussion about aging, adding depth to the exploration of taboos around illness. The couple’s son, a father himself battling addiction and mental illness while trying to care of his own son, is tasked with ensuring the safety and security of his parents. The awkward and difficult debates about changing the way his parents live likely resonate with those who have faced the challenge of providing for people who used to provide for them. Navigating respectability, social norms, parental dynamics, and monetary issues, the couple’s son doesn’t do a perfect job in these conversations, and he shouldn’t be expected to. Bringing to light the tumultuous uncertainty of illness, “Vortex” highlights the universality and difficulty of aging and taking care of those who are.
Noé shows viewers the looming mortality facing humanity through “Vortex” and provides a candid glimpse into how that mortality drives life. A brutal exploration of malady and mourning, “Vortex” artfully grapples with a despair that most choose to push to the edges of their minds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was disappointed, but not surprised to read Libby E. Tseng’s op-ed  (April 9) “ To the class of 2026.” Her description of the student experience elucidates findings of our national study of higher education, in which nearly half of one thousand students across 10 disparate campuses view college principally as a means to build a resume and get a (first) job. Consequently, like Tseng, many students face disappointment and sadness with the college experience—a third of these students feel alienated from their institution and nearly all of the students report mental health as the biggest problem.
It is no wonder students have grievances at Harvard and elsewhere — colleges overpromise and underdeliver. In an effort to please all of customers, colleges offer a multiplicity of missions focused on everything from career development to citizenship to innovation—which not only becomes confusing to students, but also self-defeating. Students, like those at Harvard, feel that they should be involved in everything—and sometimes lead everything—in order to be a “successful” college student, one that will be attractive to employers. Rather than bringing students together in a common pursuit, colleges foster students who become overwhelmed, divided, and splintered.
In our research we learned that campuses with a strong mission (optimally, one focused on intellectual development) that is promulgated from day one and reinforced until graduation, constitute healthier environments. Indeed, these campuses offer a transformative culture focused on learning and growing personally, and not primarily on earning.
As a long time member of the Harvard community, I admire much about the institution, but its challenges and problems resemble those observed on quite diverse campuses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quelle surprise. A haphazard, shockingly disorganized new constitution has had haphazard, shockingly disorganized results. Club funding will continue only because of the unusual efforts of a handful of students, and the Undergraduate Council’s summer storage program may remain underfunded. We wish that our student leaders cared more about their most basic responsibility to distribute funding, and we reluctantly call for some adults in the room to help them do so.
As we said ahead of the student body referendum, the Harvard Undergraduate Association was not a sufficiently thought-out replacement for the flawed organization it has superseded. Perhaps the single most predictable requirement for the HUA was always going to be providing for the transition period, and its founding document was astonishingly light on this issue. We are grateful for the student leaders who stepped up to keep the lights on despite this poor planning. There are, it seems, exceptions to the general cultural problems of student government.
But those people, working overtime to keep the student ship of state afloat, are few and far between. Showboating and self-aggrandizement are all too common. The resulting culture of dysfunctionality was apparent in the UC, but seems not to have gone far. A broadly chaotic transition period has shown us just how far the HUA has to go to improve over its predecessor.
This transitional neglect is emblematic of a brand of student government that burnishes LinkedIn profiles better than it takes care of basic responsibilities. Student government at Harvard suffers from an egotism that prioritizes self-important political machinations over the sometimes boring but always necessary work which we elect our peers to do.
We are left ever more confident that any effective student government at Harvard will require a  drastic cultural shift. We need structures that disincentivize attention-seeking and attract students who are willing to focus on the unglamorous work of good governance. To take just one example, incorporations of House Committees would be a step in the right direction. Genuine caretakers of the Houses and their communities, House Committees provide a model of student governance sans opportunism and theatrics.
In a more radical departure, the HUA’s transition period ought to be more closely supervised by administrators. Frankly, the lack of transition guidance addressed to critical issues like summer storage represents a serious dereliction. The unusually student-driven distribution of funds at Harvard must be justified by unusually responsible students. To mitigate the fallout of this transition, some small increase in adult supervision seems an acceptable concession.
For now, it’s time to put out fires. It seems, through the unusual efforts of a handful of students, that this may well be achieved. Next, the longer task of fixing student government at Harvard begins. Too often at our school, “anyone can do that” means “nobody does.” At a school where everyone wants to be president, we will have to train some functionaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Falling is a strange phenomenon.
One instant I’m going about my day, and the next instant, without any notice, without any intervening time, I find myself face down on cold tile or rough concrete.
Falling is a strange phenomenon. One instant I’m functioning normally, and the next, because I tripped over Harvard’s broken sidewalks or fell down stairs that I hadn’t seen, everything screeches to a halt; because I can’t get up, I brace for the panic of the people helping me stand, take stock of my scrapes and bruises, and sheepishly walk away, my eyes locked on my feet to prevent another tumble.
Falling, in short, is a mirror that reflects the extremes of my life, forcing me to acknowledge that I’m disabled. Every day I encounter mirrors like these, reflections that pull me out of whatever I’m doing to remind me of the impassable obstacles I face.
I’ll be blunt: being disabled kind of sucks. So why, then, despite all my falls, despite everything, am I glad that I’m disabled? Why am I proud?
Like many disabled people, I have a complicated relationship with disabled identity. That I’m glad to be disabled doesn’t mean I enjoy it, and as with all preferences, it’s valid for someone to choose not to be glad; in fact, I hated my disability until a few years ago, and I’d never blame myself for that. Nor am I proud of my disability in the way that someone might be proud of their scars, as signs of the adversity they’ve overcome.
I’m proud of my disability because disabled is what I am. It’s definitely not all of me — “video game nerd,” “multicultural family,” and “amazing sense of humor” also come to mind — but it’s what I am nevertheless. “Disabled” is a fact, an identity, and a community, and sugarcoating it is only an act of denial and erasure that helps nobody.
Because “disabled” is a fact.
“Disabled” isn’t a bad word, contrary to the ever-growing list of euphemisms. No, I’m not “special needs.” I won’t be defined by society’s failure to implement universal design. No, I’m not “differently abled.” It’s patronizing, unless I’ve missed a superpower I got in exchange for being disabled. And no, I’m not “handicapped” or “dis-Abled” either.
I’m not calling myself lesser, I’m stating a fact. Don’t tiptoe around it for your own comfort, just say it: I have a disability, so I’m disabled. Some disabled people have even reclaimed the historically derogatory term “crip” to describe themselves, which now sees standard usage in disability studies. Nothing will change while people avoid seeing us as we are.
Because “disabled” is an identity.
I sometimes think about Other Ben, the Ben in some parallel universe who doesn’t possess the 150-in-8 billion gene mutation that I do, who didn’t win the lottery that he never entered. Does Other Ben walk up stairs without a second thought? Can he recite all of Mario’s power-ups? What’s it feel like being taller than five feet? Does he go to Harvard? Would my friends like him more than they like me?
I don’t know, and ultimately, I don’t care. I’ve realized that we’re different people. Of course, we’d share some similarities; but we couldn’t pick each other out of a crowd, read the other’s feelings, or even name their hobbies. We live different lives in different bodies and minds.
So if I were offered a magic cure for my disability, I think I’d turn it down. I’d rather stay disabled. I’d be tempted, sure. But losing my disability would be losing part of myself, an aspect of my experiences that helps shape all my actions, beliefs, and dreams.
As disability rights pioneer Judy Heumann said, exemplifying the social model of disability, “Disability only becomes a tragedy when society fails to provide the things we need to live our lives.”
So what is disability before our built environment transforms it into the tragedy the world sees it as? It’s an identity. Yet it’s so much more than that, too.
Because “disabled” is a community.
I rarely feel as at home as I do among disabled people. My best friend since third grade, who passed away two years ago but still teaches me whatever I know about kindness, strength, and sarcasm; my stay at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a camp for disabled children, where I discovered what true happiness and belonging feels like; my friends in the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Club, where we support each other after hard days and argue over whether King Princess is objectively hot. Disabled people aren’t a monolith, but we have a distinct culture: one of listening, empathy, and never leaving anyone behind, a perspective I bring with me through each day.
Because “disabled” is a life, and I’m proud to be part of it.
One night at Hole in the Wall, I was trying to identify constellations in the sky. I realized I’d never truly looked up at the sky before.
“Remember to look up at the stars,” my counselor responded.
Living a disabled life means that I fall, and as I lie stunned, I see my reality of existing in this world reflected on a mirror of concrete or tile. But it’s a broken mirror, cracked by many falls; and in its brokenness, it refracts light into a million component shades, revealing not only my struggles, but — if I focus beyond my newly-acquired scrapes and bruises — all the smiles and tears of my life.
And so, even while I keep my gaze trained on my feet, I witness the starlight above, and I’m proud.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, the Cambridge City Council discussed a proposal to construct bike lanes on parts of Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and North Cambridge, ultimately delaying a vote until later in the month.
Councilors discussed a report from city staff detailing a proposal and timeline to construct bike lanes on four segments of Mass. Ave. The four segments, referred to collectively as “MassAve4,” share “unique complicating factors,” such as overhead bus wires and concrete medians, that make bike lane construction challenging, per the report.
Under the Cycling Safety Ordinance, a law passed by the Council in 2019 and amended in 2020, the city must approve a plan to construct bike lanes on the MassAve4 segments by April 30, 2022.
The report proposes building “partial construction” bike lanes — sitting at street level and separated from traffic by posts or a curb — on segments of Mass. Ave. between Dudley Street and Beech Street and between Roseland Street and Waterhouse Street. The report also considers “full construction” bike lanes — at sidewalk level — alongside the Mass. Ave. bus stops in Harvard Square.
According to the report, the installations would be completed by 2026 for an overall price of approximately $55 million.
During the meeting, Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 said the Council has received “hundreds of emails” from residents concerned about the economic impact the bike lanes might have on local businesses.
Ruth Ryals, president of the Porter Square Neighbors Association, called on the city to “work very hard with other property owners in the area to identify additional parking sources” during the meeting’s public comment period.
An economic analysis of the ordinance commissioned by the Council is currently underway. The Council also recently convened an advisory committee to propose improvements to the implementation of the CSO.
City Councilor Paul F. Toner called for the deadlines in the CSO to be revised, giving the city more time to deliberate with residents and local businesses before committing to a plan.
“We’re the one who made this policy and put this timeline on ourselves,” Toner said.
Last month, the city announced it would fail to meet a separate CSO deadline requiring the construction of quick-build bike lanes in Porter Square by May 1, 2022. At that time, the Council accepted the delay in construction to allow for further study and “meaningful engagement” with area stakeholders.
At the end of the discussion, Councilor Dennis J. Carlone tabled discussion on the proposal. The Council will reconsider it at the next full meeting on April 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall, after The Crimson discovered a large-scale information security oversight at Harvard that left tens of thousands of administrative files available for University affiliates to view and download, school officials said they took quick steps to patch the issue.
But Harvard’s IT troubles didn’t end there.
A second, similar security oversight left thousands of internal files from units across the University available for anyone with Harvard login credentials to access via the collaborative platform Microsoft SharePoint. Users logged in with their school account could find the files by entering keywords into the platform's search function.
The documents left vulnerable ranged from obsolete files, such as outdated organizational charts and personal memos, to some sensitive material, such as information about University finances, donors, and employees.
The vulnerability — discovered by The Crimson earlier this month, less than six months after the first issue was resolved — was patched by the school after the newspaper raised questions about the issue.
In a statement on Monday, Harvard University Information Technology spokesperson Timothy J. Bailey wrote that “HUIT has taken steps to address the potential for confidential information to be accessed by unauthorized individuals.”
Many Harvard units use Microsoft 365 software — including SharePoint — to distribute documents internally. SharePoint offers file creators privacy settings ranging from personal use only to a “shared with everyone” option, which led some employees to inadvertently share their work with all Harvard affiliates — not just their teams, as likely intended.
“Microsoft 365’s privacy settings allow users of SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams to specify and manage exactly who can access a file or folder, enabling Harvard staff, faculty, and students to securely collaborate,” Bailey wrote. “HUIT is aware that some Microsoft 365 owners have improperly applied privacy settings, enabling others within the Harvard community to access information that was not intended for them.”
Since the issue was raised by The Crimson, the school has set most publicly accessible files to private, restricted document sharing settings across the University, and begun to examine whether there was unauthorized access to confidential information, Bailey wrote.
A Microsoft spokesperson wrote that the company is “aware of the issue and supporting our customer.”
The second security oversight differs slightly from the one discovered in October, when users were able to access files through the search engine Bing. Before the issue was resolved in the fall, Bing users who logged in with Harvard email accounts could view and download at least tens of thousands of files that were stored on the Microsoft-owned platforms OneDrive and SharePoint. After The Crimson alerted University officials to the issue, the school disabled the function that created the Bing oversight and shut down a similar collaboration tool within Microsoft 365 called Delve.
Kennesaw State University Information Security professor Andrew Green said Harvard is grappling with the challenge of keeping files available for affiliates who need access to them while ensuring there are enough security measures to limit access to unauthorized users.
“The complexity with which we’re trying to manage these situations, via the controls that are built into services like SharePoint, is just becoming more and more difficult,” Green said. “The needs of people to share these assets and have access to them, almost regardless of location, is a complex problem to tackle. There’s no easy solution here.”
Chris J. Hoofnagle, a faculty director of the UC Berkeley’s Center for Law and Technology, said Harvard could take “triage steps” to resolve the issue, such as utilizing a service that identifies whether documents on shared internal networks contain sensitive information, such as credit card and social security numbers.
“You want a tripwire system so that you can instantly know whether particularly sensitive data are in your services,” he said. “Those are widely available now.”
Green said the most effective way to patch the issue would be to control access by grouping University affiliates into specific categories and administering certain sharing privileges to each.
“The cleanest way, but definitely not the simplest — and definitely work-intensive and labor-intensive — is tailoring access controls to groups,” he said.
But creating such groups at a large, decentralized institution like Harvard can be difficult, Hoofnagle said — especially when school affiliates hold multiple roles concurrently, such as student and teaching assistant.
“The lines between our roles and our authorities are so blurry,” he said.
Nathan Good, a lecturer at UC Berkeley’s School of Information, said he believes Harvard has solved the problem in the short-term. But he said the University should examine how affiliates use and understand Microsoft 365 in order to prevent users from unintentionally misusing the service again.
“If you don’t design the system properly around it, you’re going to continue to have issues that crop up,” Good said.

Club and house email lists managed by the Harvard Computer Society have been down for at least the past week, leaving students frustrated and in the dark.
HCS, a student-run computer science organization founded in the 1980s, started offering mailing list services to clubs on campus before Harvard implemented its own system. Though some groups opt for mailing lists on other sites, a number of clubs continue to use the HCS platform to publicize events and contact club members.
HCS co-president Will C. Cooper ’23-’24 wrote in an email estimating that “50-75 active club lists and on the scale of 10,000 inactive lists” are on HCS-run servers.
Cooper wrote HCS is aware of the issues with the mailing list, which he attributed to an expired SSL certificate — a security measure — and connection issues with the organization’s remote Amazon Web Services server.
In late February, club leaders began reporting problems with the email lists to HCS, though the lists were “still largely usable” at that point, Cooper wrote.
The problem intensified by April 4, when most undergraduates lost the ability to send or receive emails on lists run by HCS servers.
Winthrop House resident Tess C. Kelley ’23 said she noticed an issue with the email server when she tried to forward a message publicizing a student musical production to her house email list.
“I didn’t really notice I wasn’t getting forwarded emails anymore — I wasn’t getting list-serv emails — until that happened,” said Kelley, a Crimson magazine editor.
Lauren L. Zhang ’24, co-director of Harvard Minuet, said she first realized she was unable to send or receive emails last week.
“It’s just been a massive headache for coordinating meetings and trips, and the thing is, we didn’t get an error message straightaway,” said Zhang, an inactive Crimson news editor. “The error message probably came in two days later.”
Kristin B. King ’23-’24, president of the Harvard Curling Club, said they first noticed problems with the club’s email list around mid-February but did not receive any error messages.
“People have been experiencing it on different timelines, but no one’s had any sort of resolution,” King said. “The HCS website is down, so I have no idea how to contact them.”
“At this point, we’re probably just gonna have to make a new email list, which is really unfortunate because our previous email list had all of our alumni donors,” King added. “To lose that network is a massive problem for us.”
In 2017, HCS’s email list system faced scrutiny when The Crimson reported that over 1.4 million emails, including financial information and grades, stored on their servers were publically available.
Over the past few years, maintaining email lists has been the “largest source of stress” for HCS leadership and tech teams, Cooper wrote.
Cooper wrote HCS does not know when the issue will be fixed, though they hope to provide club leaders with “an alternative method of communication” if the problem is not resolved within two weeks. He added that HCS is looking into transferring mailing list responsibilities to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences or Harvard University Information Technology.
“We apologize for the inconveniences that this issue has caused for the greater community, and we appreciate everyone’s patience,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology removed a pipe tomahawk that once belonged to Ponca chief Standing Bear from its collections last September, after calls for the museum to return the tomahawk to the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska and the Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma garnered international attention.
Oklahoma attorney and lineal descendant of Standing Bear Brett A. Chapman called attention to the tomahawk in a viral Twitter thread last May, prompting Nebraska State Senator Tom R. Brewer to sponsor a bipartisan resolution in the Nebraska State Legislature calling upon the University to return the tomahawk. The museum then initiated talks with Chapman and Ponca tribal leaders on a potential repatriation of the relic.
According to Jane Pickering, director of the Peabody Museum, Ponca tribal representatives planned to travel to Cambridge and take possession of the tomahawk last October, but ultimately canceled their visit due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“When I last heard from them they planned to reschedule their visit for the Spring,” Pickering wrote in an email.
“The Peabody stands ready to welcome the delegation and assist in any way we can,” she added. “In the meantime, we continue to care for the pipe tomahawk but do not allow access to it without permission from the tribal governments.”
Chapman said he pushed for the repatriation of the tomahawk to “bring visibility” to the experiences of Native Americans. Standing Bear played a pivotal role in an 1879 landmark federal case that legally defined Native Americans as people under United States law.
“In this, what I would call a cultural zeitgeist, that we’re in at the time, with racial justice and things of that nature, I think repatriation is an issue that fits right into that,” Chapman said.
Chapman said he would travel to Cambridge “on [his] own dollar” to retrieve the tomahawk if Ponca tribal representatives ask him to make the trip.
He added that he believes the tomahawk should not be shipped across the country through the mail, but he acknowledged that tribal representatives may face significant challenges preventing them from traveling to Cambridge, noting they would have to make “a decent drive to an airport.” The trip from Niobrara, Nebraska – the headquarters of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska – to the airport in Omaha would take approximately three hours by car.
“It is a hardship, in a way, for these tribal leaders to travel,” Chapman said.
Larry D. Wright, a former chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said in an interview last May he hoped to work with the museum to take back the tomahawk.
“While we appreciate the museum's mission and efforts, those items we feel are best repatriated back to the Ponca for what they represent, who they belonged to originally, and what that history means to us,” he said.

UPDATED: April 12, 2022 at 5:09 p.m.
Chanting “end the occupation” and “apartheid has got to go,” Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine protesters disrupted an event with Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog, at the Harvard Kennedy School on Thursday.
The Kennedy School’s Israel Caucus, a student group, organized the event with Herzog. The discussion was moderated by Eric B. Rosenbach, co-director of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. Shortly after Herzog began speaking, protestors interrupted the ambassador with chants and walked out of the event.
Morgan K. Benson, an HKS student who participated in the walkout, said he protested the Kennedy School’s decision to host “perpetrators of apartheid.”
“I’m disappointed that I go to a school where we can’t speak plainly about justice for Palestinians and the conditions that they’re living under, and that we are willing to platform war criminals who have directly contributed to those injustices,” Benson said. “It’s just important for students to counteract that normalization of the occupation that’s happening at the school.”
Joseph G. Leone, a student at the Kennedy School who also participated in the walkout, said he recognizes the school will invite a range of government officials, but those responsible “for Israeli apartheid and settler colonialism shouldn’t be welcomed at HKS.”
“HKS is going to host officials of various countries — that’s true — and we host plenty of odious figures from the United States as well,” Leone said. “But I think there’s a line, and I think that HKS has lines as well.”
Elad Strohmayer, a spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, wrote in a statement that “the Ambassador came with the purpose of engaging in an open and honest dialogue.”
“While the Ambassador welcomes criticism, it was a shame that a small group of students only cared to create a provocation,” Strohmayer wrote. “Change can be achieved by listening to one another and the Ambassador came with this purpose: to listen to and to have a productive conversation with the students.”
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith said in a statement that the Kennedy School is “committed to open debate.”
“The School recognizes students’ rights to non-disruptive protest and dissent as well as students’ rights to organize events and ensure that invited speakers can present their views and be asked questions,” Smith said.
Leone said Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine has “no plans to let up” its protests of Israeli officials at HKS, including its weekly protest of Amos Yadlin, a retired Israeli Defense Forces general and senior fellow at the Belfer Center.
In a statement, the Kennedy School’s Israel Caucus condemned the protest.
“The vibrance of Israel’s democracy and the ability to critique the state is one of the things we most admire about our home,” the group wrote. “Many in the caucus have been protesting policy we disagree with, including the occupation, all our lives.”
The group wrote that “the peace process has been stalled by those on both sides who deny that the other is a partner for peace.” The protestors “chose to fuel this destructive stance by telling the Israeli ambassador that we at Harvard are unwilling to speak to him,” its statement said.
“Instead of pressing Israel’s most powerful diplomat on Israeli policy they disagree with, they shouted and left the room,” the statement said. “This kind of action may make American graduate students feel good about themselves, but it will neither promote justice nor peace for those actually living the conflict.”
Leone said Thursday’s walkout was the second time that week he protested an Israeli official at the Kennedy School.
“The frequency of these events is just shocking,” Leone said. “I have classes that meet less frequently than there is an IDF general speaking at HKS.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Representative Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) spoke about the role of technology in the future of the American economy while discussing his new book at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Monday evening.
Harvard professors Michael J. Sandel and Amartya K. Sen joined Khanna at the event, which was moderated by Anika Bagaria ’24 and IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78.
Khanna said the decision to offshore a lot of manufacturing jobs, which has “left out lots of people and communities” in the United States, needs to be fixed.
“Maybe that helped consumer prices, but the reality is a lot of that led to a loss of income, a loss of jobs,” he said. “And the beneficiaries of it ultimately was a lot of capital, people who owned the capital.”
According to Khanna, there now exists a “bipartisan consensus” on returning some production to the United States because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the “hollowing out of the middle class,” and “the rise of China.”
The panelists also discussed efforts to regulate social media companies. Sandel gave the audience his definition of social media companies’ business model — “to commandeer our attention and hold it for as long as possible, so that they can capture more personal data about us, so that they can use that data to try to sell us stuff.”
“That seems to me a pernicious business model that’s deeply corrosive of democracy,” Sandel warned.
“Not only because it depends on hooking people with sensationalistic and often false and hateful information and news feeds,” he added, “but the whole idea of capturing our attention and directing it to the empty, banal, and sensationalistic stuff that draws our attention distracts us from more important things to pay attention to.”
Khanna agreed with Sandel that the business model of social media companies is a problem.
“The attention economy is universal,” he said. “The television competes for attention, newspapers compete for attention, but the difference — as you point out — is here the monetization of data from attention is what makes it so much worse.”
“Yeah, they want you to keep reading the New York Times or The Harvard Crimson, but they’re not taking more and more of your data, the more time you spend,” Khanna added.
Khanna also addressed the racial wealth gap in Silicon Valley tech companies.
“You have this situation in Silicon Valley where some of the platforms are popularized by African Americans, Latino Americans, but they’re not on the boards,” he said. “They’re not the recipients of venture capital, 0.32 percent of venture capital is going to Black women entrepreneurs.”
Khanna said that the lack of representation of minority communities in “the people who are writing the checks” is an “enormous issue.”
“It was easy for people in Silicon Valley to march against the brutality of George Floyd, which was thousands of miles away,” Khanna said. “It’s much harder to march about greater inclusion, about practices within these tech companies in the generation of wealth.”
In an interview prior to the forum, Khanna said he thinks student debt will be canceled and a climate deal can be reached before the end of the year.
“On the student debt, we just need to do it,” he said. “The president needs to do it. At least, $10,000, which he campaigned on.”
To get climate legislation done, Khanna said he has advocated for letting Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) “have the pen.”
“We’ve got to cut a deal with Machin and get that done,” he said. “This is our chance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“One thing that our team has really come a long way in this semester is with our confidence and belief in ourselves,” said first-year Holly Fischer. “So I think that even though we were down, everyone who was playing was fighting so hard and really leaving everything out on the court.”
The Harvard women’s and men’s tennis teams had grueling weekends against Ivy League opponents Columbia and Cornell, with the men on the road in New York and the women holding down home court in Cambridge. After long, hard-fought matches from both squads on Saturday and Sunday, the Crimson women and men walked away with two more victories each, well-poised for a strong end to regular season competitions.
WOMEN’S TENNIS
On Saturday, Harvard (12-7, 3-0 Ivy League) set the tone for a successful weekend with a decisive 4-1 victory over No. 56 Columbia at the Murr Center in Cambridge, M.A., securing the Crimson’s fifth consecutive victory.
“Going into this weekend our team was focused and we were definitely all super motivated,” Fischer said. “We knew these would be two tough matches coming up.”
The preparation paid off instantly, as Harvard got off to a scorching start in doubles play, with the duo of first-year Angel You and sophomore Iveta Daujotaite finishing first with a 7-5 victory, followed by Fischer and first-year Maxi Duncan securing the point with a 6-4 victory.
“I really like playing with [Duncan] and I think our games compliment each other really well,” Fischer said. “We both like to play very aggressively so we had a clear idea of how we wanted to play against Columbia and what we wanted to do on the court.”
The Crimson found continued success against the Lions in singles play, with You and sophomore Sany Gawande taking down their Columbia opponents by scores of 6-0, 6-0, and 6-2, 6-2, respectively. On the fourth court, junior Mihaela Marculescu was defeated in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, tightening up the match, leaving it up to Fischer, Duncan, and junior Sophia Ho to finish it off. After a 6-4 victory in the first set, Fischer was challenged in the second set, bringing the set to a score of 6-5 before the final few serves. Eventually, Fischer broke through and secured a 7-5 win, clinching the match for Harvard.
“Everyone on our team was really fighting for every point because we knew that the matches could go either way,” said Fischer. “After the final point I think we all kind of breathed a sigh of relief because the whole day was very intense.”
The Crimson saw continued success on Sunday against Cornell, finishing the day against the Big Red with their sixth consecutive victory by a 4-2 margin. Fischer and Duncan carried their momentum from the day before in doubles play with a dominating 6-0 performance against a duo from Columbia. Senior Rachel Lim and Marculescu followed up with a similarly convincing 6-2 win to capture the doubles point, once again putting the team up early.
In singles play, Harvard found themselves in a bit more trouble. Gawande secured a victory on the sixth court, 6-3, 6-2, but Ho and Fischer dropped their games by scores of 6-2, 6-0, and 6-2, 6-1, respectively. Fischer noted that despite these losses that tied up the match at 2-2, the Crimson women have learned over the course of the season to stay resilient and stick together until the end.
“Cornell is definitely a tricky team, and I think that even though the conditions were tough yesterday everyone was doing what they could do to find a way to get through their match which I think was ultimately reflected in the team’s win,” said Fischer.
Duncan followed Fischer’s tough defeat with a huge 6-2, 6-1 win on the second court, leaving first-year Rachel Arbitman and senior Rachel Eason to secure the win. Arbitman went the distance in a tense 7-6(7-1) first set, but came out firing in the second set with a statement 6-0 performance to clinch the match.
To close off the regular season, four more Ivy League opponents await Harvard, including No. 48 Princeton this Saturday and No. 62 Yale at the end of April. The Crimson will look to maintain their success against its biggest rivals as it nears the end of the regular season
MEN’S TENNIS
No. 16 Harvard started off the weekend with a decisive 4-1 win against No. 23 Columbia, their second win in the Ivy League this spring. This also marks the Crimson’s second victory over the Lions this season.
Senior captain Brian Shi recognized the importance of this win for the team.
“It’s always tough going up against Columbia, they’re such a great team,” he said. “In the past few years they’ve pretty much been our biggest rival, and the team to beat in the Ivy League.”
Harvard took the doubles point by securing wins in the top two matches. Shi and first-year Daniel Milavsky took on Columbia’s Theo Winegar and Max Westphal on Court 1, eventually winning the set 6-1. Meanwhile, sophomore Ronan Jachuck and junior Harris Walker fought Alex Kotzen and Henry Ruger of the Lions in a close 7-5 set. Both duos struggled to get the necessary break, going back and forth to the very end.
“It came down to just a couple of points at the end to get one break at 6-5 to close out the set and clinch the doubles point,” Jachuck explained. “We executed really well, and committed to playing our aggressive tennis.”
Singles play was similarly successful for the Crimson, with three straight-set victories. Walker defeated Max Westphal 6-2, 6-3 on Court 3, while Jachuck secured a 6-3, 6-4 win over Austen Huang. Shi fought to a tie-break in his first set, but came back with a vengeance in the second to win 7-6 (6), 6-0.
A combination of momentum from the first set and support from his teammates helped Shi maintain his lead. “I saw my team getting hyped and I used that to get over the finish line,” Shi recalled.
Following their win at Columbia, Harvard was back on the road to face Cornell. In a slightly closer matchup, the Crimson emerged victorious at 4-2, continuing their 3-0 Ivy League winning streak and bringing their record for the season to 13-4.
Once again, Harvard took the lead over their opponent in doubles, clinching the doubles point. Jachuck and Walker had an effective match on court two against Cornell’s Adit Sinha and Nathan Mao, serving out the set for a 6-3 win. On the third court, sophomore Henry von der Schulenburg and junior Steven Sun got a break and took the set 6-4 against Radu Papoe and Pietro Rimondini.
“[Walker] and I always want to play our matches on our terms,” Jachuck said. “We got an early break, and gave the break back, but we did feel that we were the ones making the plays.”
Singles play proved challenging, with the top half of Cornell’s lineup coming out swinging. Shi fell to Vladislav Melnic in straight sets, 4-6, 4-6, marking the end of his 13-match winning streak. Despite the loss, Shi wasn’t discouraged.
“I didn’t play as good of a level as I hoped I would and I know I can, but I’m not too upset about the match, because as a team we were able to come out with the win,” he shared.
Although Harvard lost in the top two matches, number three seed Walker defeated Cornell’s Radu Papoe 6-2, 7-6 (3), and Jachuck quickly beat Evan Bynoe 6-0, 6-1 in the fourth spot. This win over the Big Red leads the Crimson into the next phase of Ivy League competition as Harvard faces off against Princeton and Penn at home next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two weeks, Harvard track and field has kicked off its spring season with four school records, a strong performance at the Duke Invitational, and a sweep of Yale in their dual meet. The early-season success sets a strong tone for the rest of the campaign.
“The turn around from winter to spring season is very quick. A lot of us only get a couple days off before we are right back training, so the bumps and bruises of a long season can really start to show,” commented senior co-captain Kylie Hilton on the differences between the winter and spring season. “With indoor track and field, we not only have an entire preseason to train and prepare, but also many more competitions. It’s also nice to have the whole team out there competing. Some events, like the javelin, are only outdoors, which means those athletes do not get to compete until the spring. It’s nice to watch all their hard work finally show in competition.”
On March 24-26, Harvard’s distance teams traveled down to N.C. for the Raleigh Relays. For the men, senior standout Matthew Pereira finished 15th in the 5k, good enough for fourth best in school history. In the 10k, sophomore Acer Iverson set a new Crimson record, placing sixth in the event with a time of 28:24.56, which bested the previous record set by Olympian Kieran Tuntivate ‘20. Not far behind, senior David Melville set the third-best time in Harvard history, crossing the line in 29:13.44.
For the women, senior Judy Pendergast also set a school record in the 5k, finishing in tenth with a time of 15:58.54. Later, first-year Maia Ramsden put up the second-best time in Harvard history in the 1500m, placing ninth in four minutes, 18.06 seconds. Finally, in the 10k, junior Iz Sagar finished 20th and first-year Eloise Freitag finished 30th, good enough for fifth and eighth all-time for the Crimson, respectively.
The same weekend, the short distance and field athletes split between the Hurricane Invitational at UMiami and Riverhawk Invitational at UMass Lowell. In Fla., junior Tina Martin, first-year Egbe Ndip-Agbor, senior Jada Jones, and first-year Eden Finkelstein captured a win in the 4x100m relay with a time of 45.36. Continuing her strong day, Finkelstein came in first in the 100m with a time of 11.61. Senior Sharelle Samuel and first-year Izzy Goudros added two more wins to the Harvard tally, taking first place in the 400m hurdles and javelin respectively. Finally, despite not winning the event, freshman Anastasia Retsa set a Harvard record in the women’s pole vault with a mark of 4.15m in a third-place effort.
For the men, the 4x100m team of senior DeMarkes Stradford, sophomore Lance Ward, first-year Oliver Murcko, and sophomore Jaeschel Acheampong broke the Crimson record with a time of 40.28. Sophomore short-distance sprinter Greg Lapit also captured a victory in the 400m, crossing the finish line in 47.63 seconds. Junior Simon Park, sophomore Alexander Kolesnikoff, and senior Sam Welsh, finished first in the pole vault, shot put, and discus respectively.
In Mass., the smaller Crimson squad achieved similar results, with first-year Jack McDonough, sophomore Marcus Miller, and  sophomore Codi-Ann Reid winning the 1500m, 200m, and triple jump.
This past weekend, three Harvard athletes posted strong performances in multi-events at the Duke Invitational. Goudros continued her stellar season, placing second in the heptathlon with a total of 5,444 points. This mark was the second highest in school history at the meet. Sophomore Jada Johnson also had a strong day in the heptathlon, finishing seventh. Finally, junior John Minicus placed third in the decathlon with 6,532 points, setting a new personal best and tallying the third-highest score in program history.
To round out the week, in the first spring Havard-Yale dual meet since 2019, the Crimson men and women swept the Bulldogs 87-62 and 75-70 respectively. On the track, the same record-setting 4x100m team from late March repeated their success in New Haven, winning the event by 0.06 seconds. Melville ran a personal best of  9:10.05 in the 3k, good enough to win and notch the eighth-fastest time in Harvard history. In addition, Ward won the 400m with a time of 47.50, the ninth-fastest by a Crimson athlete, and Stradford won the 100m, third best in school history. First-year Peter Fischer won in the 400m hurdles, while Pereira continued his dominance in the 5k, winning the event with a time of 13:50.17. Pereira’s performance was good enough for fourth all time for Harvard. The Crimson continued its success in the field events, with junior Kyle Murphy, first-year John Chilson, and fellow first-year Kenneth Ikeji winning the long jump, javelin, and hammer throw, respectively.
For the Harvard women, first year Shaked Leibovitz set a personal best in the 3k steeplechase, the eighth-fastest time in school history. In the 800m, senior Anna Juul set a personal best, winning the event in 2:09.13. Finkelstein captured two event wins on the day, setting the sixth-best mark by a Crimson athlete in the long jump and later winning the 200m. Junior Estel Valeanu, junior Hannah McLaughlin, and junior Cammy Garabian won the discus, the javelin, and the hammer throw. Garabian’s hammer throw landed her in fifth in the Crimson record books.
“Our training cycles vary across all the event groups, but generally speaking we will start easing off around mid-April to give our bodies time to relax and prepare for championship season,” noted junior co-captain Max Serrano-Wu on the training strategy going forward. “We have a couple of two days meets coming up at Auburn, [Virginia], and Baylor, so we’ll decrease the practice intensity going into those meets to ensure we perform at the highest level. We have to make sure we take care of our bodies on the ‘other side’ of the river, like sleeping and eating properly, and staying on top of academics.”
Following the strong start to the spring track and field season, Harvard will compete in two meets next weekend, at Auburn on April 15-16 and at UMass again on April 16.

Do you miss Housing Day? Want to fuel your House pride even more? Here’s my experience sneaking into dining in every single upperclassman dining hall…
Quick shoutout to my lovely friends who were willing to trek to the Quad to keep me company.
Cabot
Why is Cabot’s dining hall below Pfoho? This was confusing. The low ceilings and carpeted floors made the space feel a little constricting and outdated, but I liked the windows along the side, allowing light to stream in and brighten up the space.
Currier
Like Cabot, the carpet and low ceilings trend continues. The lack of windows is a little depressing, but the soothing sounds of the fountain in the center of the seating area make up for it. Still, everyone says that Currier has the best food, and I think I actually might agree. The salad selection was popping, and even HUDS classics just tasted more defined and better seasoned.
Pfoho
With slightly outdated chairs, the house plants scattered around the room, and the fact that I went to eat here during Brunch on Junior Family Weekend, I couldn’t help but feel that I was on a family vacation and had entered a hotel breakfast area. I was a little outraged that they only had a regular waffle machine instead of a Veritaffle one, but my excitement over the two-storied room soothed my sadness.
Practicality, good food, and bright interiors combined make for strong dining halls.
Kirkland
Kirkland had chill vibes, with lots of small tables where friends were catching up in pairs or trios and other people were just enjoying a quiet lunch by themselves. I’m also a fan of their infused water and their selection of panini ingredients.
Eliot
In my purely objective opinion of a first-year who has 100% definitely not been sorted into Eliot, this was the best dining hall. The light streaming in from the tall windows, the sriracha aioli on the banh mi, the diverse selection of table types… Chef’s kiss, truly.
Winthrop
Before this, the only time I had been into Winthrop Dining Hall was during CS Night from 8 to 10 p.m. on Wednesday, and let me just tell you that it is a completely different experience during the day. The servery felt so clean and modern and was playing absolute bops, and I loved the sunlight streaming through the windows. Now I get why everyone wants to be put in Winthrop.
The extra distance is worth it for the beautiful dining halls.
Leverett 
Eating in Lev feels like you are sitting inside of a wedding cake, with the rich white color of the entire interior, the gorgeous chandeliers, and the intricate trim. Still, what you gain in elegance, you sacrifice in flexibility in dining. Leverett notoriously has strict interhouse dining restrictions, and it took a lot of convincing for me to not feel its wrath.
Mather
Mather’s interior is CONFUSING. I completely entered the dining hall from the wrong side and did not realize until I exited that there was an actual entrance. Still, I really enjoyed this dining hall. The servery was streamlined, but my favorite part was the strong sense of community. The dining room had a distinct energy, and it seemed like lots of friends were randomly meeting up here and calling out to each other across the room, like one big family.
Dunster
I am in love with Dunster’s dining hall. Especially during the day, it is beautiful to see the sun streaming in. The servery also felt clean and spacious, although the drinks and dessert section felt a little random. Don’t forget about the handwashing station!
Large, bustling dining halls with very distinct personalities.
Lowell
I’m not sure how I feel about the yellow walls: it makes you happy at first, but gets old fast. The servery area felt a little cramped, but the high ceilings make the space seem airy. The place was lively; everyone in Lowell seemed to be eating there, making it a challenge to find open seating, but a big victory once we did.
Quincy
The people’s house. This was probably the house that I felt the least scared about swiping into. I came for the famous Quincy Hot Breakfast, and honestly, I thought it tasted better than Berg breakfast so I’ve been back several times since. The floor to ceiling windows on both sides of the dining room are perfect for people watching.
Adams
I had a little bit of a scary experience swiping in because apparently first-years housed in Adams cannot bring guests to dinner, but it was all worth it for the yummy pumpkin squares (yes, even in April). The regal feel of the dark wood and hints of gold made me feel cool and edgy and felt perfect for a winter or even early spring dinner, although it might feel a bit heavy in mood for the summer.
After finishing this adventure of dining in each of the houses, my biggest takeaway was that all dining halls are good dining halls and that we don’t have that many meals in a week. Each had a distinct flavor — both in experience and food — but that’s what makes them special. And even if you like a different dining hall more than your own, let this article be proof that you can tag along with a friend from that house to every meal, except on Community Night of course. Harvard’s campus is your oyster. Eat in all parts of it.
