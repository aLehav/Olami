After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, in light of numerous labor abuse allegations faced by HEI Hotels and Resorts, The Crimson urged the Harvard Management Corporation to investigate the charges against the company and consider not reinvesting in it. As of last week, Harvard has joined Yale, Princeton, Brown, and numerous other universities in deciding not to reinvest in HEI. By not reinvesting, Harvard does not liquidate its current investments in HEI, but rather makes a pledge to not provide the company with more capital in the future.
In light of the recurring allegations of labor abuse that HEI has been unable to refute successfully, Harvard has surely done the right thing in deciding not to reinvest and announcing publicly its decision. Workers at the company, most prominently those lobbying for union representation, have repeatedly complained of mistreatment. The activist organization Students Against Sweatshop Labor claimed in a report that the hotel chain cuts costs by reducing staff levels excessively and forcing remaining employees to work in unreasonable conditions. Shockingly, at one HEI property, 80 percent of housekeepers reported work-related injury. Just last week, workers at HEI-owned Le Meridien Hotel right here in Cambridge   publicly voiced discontent over their work conditions.
Although it is our belief that Harvard acted appropriately, the institutional process to arrive at this sort of measure could be significantly improved. The Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, the body within the HMC that considers the social ramifications of the university’s investments, is limited to proxy voting and has no influence over new or current investment decisions. Perhaps, if this group were not so limited in its power, Harvard would not have been among the last of its Ivy League peers to announce it would not reinvest in HEI. The Responsible Investment at Harvard movement has already called for a more efficient manner to reconsider investment decisions, and we urge the University to study its proposals carefully.
In addition, we find the University’s lack of transparency regarding the resolution of this matter to be both puzzling and unnecessary. Jane L. Mendillo, the president of the HMC, said in an email to University President Drew G. Faust that the decision not to reinvest in HEI stemmed from “factors related to the HMC portfolio and its strategy and needs.” We wish that ethical considerations, not financial ones, had been the motivating factor in this case; Harvard should simply not associate itself with a company engaging in the practices allegedly committed by HEI. If the labor accusations against HEI were indeed the HMC’s primary reason for not reinvesting in the company, Harvard should have said so publicly, thus taking a clear moral stance.
Mendillo’s statement suggests, disappointingly, that investment concerns had more to do with the University’s choice than a genuine ethical sensitivity. Regardless, the public outcry against HEI seems to have had an effect, and the workers and activists who so tirelessly denounced the company have gained one more victory with Harvard’s decision. We trust it is the right one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robin Williams once said, “If you can remember the sixties, you weren’t there.”
That is how I pictured senior spring. In my dreams, I imagined it would be a time for carefree picnicking, joyful inebriation, and peaceful reflection. My professors would collectively cease to assign response papers and tests. The weather would be 80 degrees every day (rather than just two freak days). It would be the perfect way to end my time at Harvard.
Unfortunately, I have discovered that senior spring is actually a series of “false peaks.” During the First-Year Outdoor Program, we defined false peaks as the parts of the mountain that appear to top off a slope, but which turn out to be the bottom of another. Similarly, during senior spring, we think we have completed all major academic commitments, expecting to become the masters of our own time. But we quickly discover there is always another hill to ascend.
Of course, most students experience less academic urgency during senior spring than in previous semesters. Moreover, in the two weeks before Commencement, we will have time to do the things we’ve been meaning to try since freshman year, and Harvard will surely provide the requisite refreshments. But until then, we follow up our theses with piles of neglected work; oral defenses with apartment hunting; the economics honors exam with job applications (JK, econ concentrators have had jobs since October).
And now that it’s April, we have no more buffer months to separate us from graduation. So we “take stock” of our experiences, as one friend put it. If we don’t have jobs, we wonder why not; if we do, we ask whether we should have held out for others. We question the decisions—academic, social, and extracurricular—we made along the way. We worry about what we will do when we don’t live minutes away from our peers, food, and work. This tumultuous process of self-reflection causes simultaneous buyer’s and seller’s remorse in seniors. It informs how we feel we should spend our spring.
Last Thursday, in anticipation of two articles, two exams, and a paper due the following week, I chose to stay in to work. The night was not typical of an ideal senior spring, and I wondered whether I should be doing something else. But I was surprised to find myself looking forward to a night in, doing work alongside friends. Upon reflection, I realize that my time at Harvard has been made meaningful by such ubiquitous, seemingly mundane occasions: the late-night conversations in Currier House, the 15-minute breaks during orchestra rehearsal, the occasional “wow” moments in class. Those are as memorable as the Harvard-sponsored events meant to shape the end of our undergraduate careers, whether paintball trips or outings to Celtics games.
So I was due for just another Harvard evening. I settled down with a few friends in the balcony of Pforzheimer House dining hall. Doing homework there has come to be a highlight of my senior spring. It is during long nights working there that I have cultivated new friendships, where I report on the success of an April Fools’ Day prank, where I share inanities about my day over mozzarella sticks from the Quad Grille, where senior spring happens in all its ordinary glory.
So here I am, at a point I have looked forward to since freshman year. It is a time to let go and to enjoy the offerings of student life fully and without regrets. I arrive at senior spring, however, only to discover that what I choose to spend time on now are the same things I have enjoyed for the past four years. The Harvard experience is what occurs between the major events we are afraid of missing. But, knowingly or not, we might already be acting as though that were the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long before Israel was a country, it was an idea. Today, 64 years after its creation, the Jewish State stands as proof of the power of a bold idea to change the world. It is only fitting, then, that Harvard’s inaugural Israel Conference focus on the theme of innovation. Our aim in organizing this conference, as nonpartisan Israeli students from across the Harvard schools, is to share the spirit of innovation—so central to Israel’s identity—with the broader Harvard community. Our aim is to show our classmates and friends what makes our small country unique and dear to us.
Perhaps we should have known better—but to our great dismay and surprise, the posters advertising the conference that we recently put up around campus were quickly targeted and defaced. They were covered in stickers saying “apartheid” and “white phosphorus.” While we welcome legitimate forms of criticism, and understand the vital role it plays in any discussion, these actions are nothing short of vandalism. Perhaps more importantly, they represent a trend of anti-normalization of anything Israel-related, and by extension, effectively labeling us, the conference organizers, as illegitimate. The group organizing the conference is diverse, representing a wide range of political opinions. One of us, for example, heads an organization committed to promoting dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians on American campuses, another runs the North American operations for an Israeli humanitarian agency and was an active participant in the struggle against the Israeli occupation of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem. In so many ways, our world-views are probably more similar to the views of those who decided to deface the posters than they are different. This irony in turn reveals a much sorrier truth: Indiscriminate, aggressive campaigns of this sort inevitably marginalize everyone and everything related to the state of Israel, both critic and target.
We understand why this conference is upsetting for some—it is perceived as an attempt to whitewash the wrongs Israel often afflicts on the Palestinians. But we would ask that, rather than forcing this conference into that preexisting and well-worn frame, our goals receive a fair hearing. This conference is not an attempt to shift the focus from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or to replace this very important and much-needed conversation. Rather, it is an attempt to infuse new meaning into a campus discussion that has become polarized and one-dimensional. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one part of Israel’s complex and multifaceted identity. Israelis are not defined by the conflict alone, nor are the Palestinians. Delegitimizing Israel and Israelis in their entirety, persisting with a useless blame game, and refusing to recognize the complexity of the matter at hand only pushes peace farther away. A legitimate Israel and a legitimate and empowered Palestine are the only two partners capable of reaching any kind of peaceful solution for this region. Vandalizing our posters, as trivial as it may seem, conveys that Israel and Israelis are irrelevant—not worthy of being heard, not to mention negotiated with.
Sometimes it is difficult to hear voices with which we disagree. It was not easy, to say the least, for us to watch a group of Harvard students host the “One-State Conference,” which, in our eyes, challenged Israel’s fundamental right to exist. We sat quietly and attentively in the audience while speakers’ denied the Jewish people’s right to self-determination. This was an excruciating experience for us, but learning to listen to others, especially when we disagree, is what this institution is all about.
It’s because of this diversity of opinion that Harvard is uniquely positioned to be the setting for real progress in discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One attempt to inspire such conversation is the Avi Schaefer Peace Challenge, a competition open to all Harvard students, which will award $1,000 to the most innovative idea helping to bridge the gap between Israelis and Palestinians. Unfortunately, people who claim to be committed to peace responded to this initiative with derogatory cynicism, labeling the initiative as “pathetic," "ridiculous," "undesirable," "desperate," and "sloppy” on Facebook. These responses, which delegitimize discussion rather than substantively engage with it, are manifestations of the same mindset that motivated the defacement of the Israel Conference’s posters.
Of course, it doesn’t have to be this way. Hopefully in the future we can plan a conference together to show people just how complex these issues are. We must discuss one-state versus two-state, Palestinian right of return and the plight of the refugees, the issue of settlements, what it means to live under occupation, and what it feels like to live under the threat of terrorism. Any program, conference, or contest that engages in the debate over Israel and Palestine must challenge itself to change the old paradigms and find new ways to engage with these issues. That’s what we’re hoping the Harvard Israel Conference will accomplish—and we wholeheartedly hope to see you all there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elizabeth: Last year, I was the girl with the buzz cut. Harvard acquaintances either walked by me unawares or exclaimed the obvious, likely attributing my semester off to a Britney-style meltdown. Then, I’d tell them. With their reaction to the word “lymphoma,” you’d think I was He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
“Well… at least you're better!”
That’s when the conversation really got awkward. I had been shipped back to Harvard with a tentative stamp of approval: My January PET scan had shown either residual cancer or residual healing. The doctors basically said: “Well, we did what we could. You'll probably be fine.” But there I was: bright-eyed and hopeful, craving Harvard’s wrought-iron and red brick, bustle and brainpower that made me feel alive again. Yet I felt that it was all too good to be true.
My first semester back didn’t include all the perfectly landscaped greener pastures I envisioned. Thinking back, I see the disability van that drove me to class. The fertility clinic, where we talked about family planning for the family I didn’t have yet. The mental image of my latent breast cancer, being pushed ever closer to the brink of mutation with each alcoholic drink. And the intangible “chemobrain,” a drug-induced mental sluggishness without any predictable relief. In the natural selection of academia, it seemed to me that Harvard wasn't made for the weak, the worried, and the weary.
Yet I emerged as the bright, bubbly face of Relay for Life’s Survivorship Committee, even though I couldn’t even convince myself that cancer could be beat. Even though I felt like I was fooling everyone with my smile, I started to fool myself too. I accepted that life at Harvard wouldn’t be perfect—it would be a breathless, sobering, anxious time. But from my friend Valerie, my fellow Survivorship Chair, I learned that it gets better with time.
Valerie: I met Liz during her era of chemotherapy, radiation and endless hospital trips, while I was facing a different struggle in the life of someone affected by cancer: the perilous journey of survivorship.
At my small high school, having cancer was something that neither went unnoticed nor was forgotten once my hair grew back and I walked without crutches again. At Harvard, it was strange for me to be able to decide how much of my past with cancer my peers and professors would know. Even if I could filter cancer from my Harvard persona, cancer survivorship has become so integral to my identity that I couldn’t hide it, nor would want to.
No one tells you when you’re diagnosed that being a survivor is as hard as being a patient. I spent my time in treatment striving for a cancer-free life, but when I finally made it to “the light at the end of the tunnel,” the joke was on me. The normalcy I had craved no longer existed. Before cancer, I thought I had a good grasp on who I was—a daughter, a sister, and above all, a soccer player. I wanted nothing more than my team’s camaraderie and validation from a hard-fought game. Cancer made everything I wanted irrelevant.
After surgery to remove the tumor in my leg, my ability to play soccer, or any other contact sport, disappeared. I felt like part of me had died, and in a way it had.   A foot-long scar on my leg and physical limitations are daily reminders that although my tumor is gone, “cancer” in its entirety is not.
As much as survivorship is a struggle, I have come to cherish the small things in life—late-night talks with friends, bike rides with my little sister, family dinners—because I’ve realized how easily they can be lost. Biking satisfies my cravings for athletic achievement, and two summers ago, I raised money for Dana Farber by doing the Pan-Massachusetts Challenge, a 192-mile bike-a-thon. Cancer changed me completely, but in doing so, it has made me a better person that I otherwise never would have known. For that, I will always be thankful.
We are this year’s Harvard Relay For Life Survivorship Chairs. Our experiences post-chemo have been different, but Relay for Life united us and grounded our lives as survivors. Relay’s support network helps us cope with the fears and struggles of survivorship and lets us support the community that saved our lives.
Relay for Life is the American Cancer Society’s signature fundraiser. The all-night team walkathon honors those affected by cancer and inspires society to fight for an end to this disease. Harvard’s Relay will take place at Gordon Track from 6 p.m. on Saturday, April 21 to 6 a.m. on Sunday, April 22. If you wish to participate in the event, make a donation, or learn about our cause, visit www.harvardrelay.org.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard undergraduates will serve on the executive board of the College Democrats of Massachusetts, the college branch of the Massachusetts Democratic Party.
Will F. Poff-Webster ’14 and Matt R. Shuham ’15 won their respective elections for the seats last week during the annual statewide College Democrats convention. This election marks the first time in recent history that members of the Harvard College Democrats have become actively involved in the leadership of the CDM, a signal of the club’s move to foster stronger relations with the state-level party organization.
“This is the first year in a while that Harvard, as a chapter, has really gotten involved at the state level with two of the five board positions,” said Shuham, who was elected as the finance director of CDM. “Will and I want to make a point that Harvard is now beyond the Cambridge bubble—we want to reach out to the state Democratic Party and state College Democrats.”
Poff-Webster, a Crimson editorial editor who will serve as the CDM’s vice president, agreed that Harvard is shifting its political focus more toward state and local issues. He said he hopes, as vice president, to broaden CDM’s objectives beyond campaigning for candidates.
“It’s the CDM’s job to create strong connections and coordination among chapters,” Poff-Webster said, explaining the need for coordination in groundwork campaigning. “But I also want CDM to not just be a campaign organization but an issue organization.”
He added that this year’s executive board will focus on generating public support for addressing issues of public transportation—especially due to recent price hikes and cuts in service following a large deficit faced by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
With the upcoming 2012 elections, CDM also is preparing for major fundraising events by tapping into alumni networks and using the CDM’s own political action committee, according to Shuham.
“Right now we’re trying to make sure we have the organizational capacity and financial resources to run a ‘campaign invasion’ next semester,” Poff-Webster said, referring to the CDM’s work to encourage more grassroots efforts. This mobilization has included launching new chapters in community and public colleges such as Bridgewater State University and the University of Massachusetts Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In reaction to administrative concern, the Undergraduate Council rescinded its invitation last week to former Harvard lecturer Joshua Humphreys­ to participate on a panel on Harvard’s investment policies, a snub that Humphreys and a student interest group call an affront to free speech but that a University spokesperson pinned on poor communication on the part of the UC.
Humphreys and the student movement Responsible Investment at Harvard said that the UC, which organized the town hall on Thursday, took back its invite because representatives of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s endowment, refused to appear on a panel with Humphreys.
On Friday, a University spokesperson said instead that HMC asked the UC to reschedule the panel when it learned that the UC’s planned panel had different speakers than the original list that HMC had vetted. Rather than postponing the event, the UC crossed Humphreys off the slate.
Humphreys, a senior fellow at the Tellus Institute, a nonprofit policy organization, said that UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 told him that HMC’s participation hinged on changing the makeup of the panel.
“I have to admit that I’ve never received such professional discourtesy in my career, to be removed from a panel on the day of an event,” Humphreys wrote in an email to Bicknell. “This is censure of the highest order; it’s a violation of any notion of free speech and academic freedom, to say nothing of basic civility.”
A Council representative, who wished to remain anonymous to preserve relations with the administration, said that a University administrator told the UC specifically that the University was “uncomfortable” with an article Humphreys had published.
The event, billed as a forum for discussion about Harvard’s endowment, brought together experts on university investments and sustainable investment practices.
Responsible Investment at Harvard, which co-hosted the event, declined to comment on Friday on the rescinded invitation. Close to midnight on Sunday, the group released a statement alleging that HMC refused “to send representatives to speak on a panel alongside Dr. Humphreys.”
“We are highly disappointed by the HMC’s decision to retract our invitation to Dr. Joshua Humphreys—a preeminent scholar on university endowment ethics and a former Harvard lecturer—after he was invited by RI@Harvard, confirmed by the UC, and widely publicized as a confirmed participant,” the group wrote in an email to The Crimson, the UC president and vice president, and University administrators.
The group condemned “HMC’s decision to stifle free speech” and called for another panel later in the year. The statement was later posted on the organization’s website.
University spokespeople could not be reached for comment early on Monday.
The panel did include voices critical of HMC. Robert Zevin, founder of Zevin Asset Management and one of the four panelists who participated, said the University should consider “integration of environmental, social, and governance factors” when making investment decisions.
The other panelists were Law School professor Allen Ferrell, HMC board member Robert Kaplan, and Business School professor Rakesh Khurana.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 9, 2012 at 8:56 p.m.
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren announced Monday that her campaign for U.S. Senate raised $6.9 million in the first three months 2012—the largest single-quarter total seen thus far in the high-profile Massachusetts race and more than double the amount raised in the same time by her Republican opponent, Senator Scott Brown.
For the third consecutive quarter, Warren outpaced Brown, who raised a more modest $3.4 million in the first three months of this year. Warren saw a moderate increase from the final quarter of 2011, when she raised $5.7 million.
“The incredible enthusiasm we have seen from people across the Commonwealth who are contributing to this campaign shows the strong grassroots momentum behind Elizabeth’s fight for middle class families,” Warren campaign manager Mindy Myers wrote in a statement.
Political analysts said that Warren’s totals are impressive and indicate that her campaign has attracted unusually high levels of attention.
“That’s a big number, especially for a fist time candidate,” Democratic consultant Daniel B. Payne said. “It demonstrates that a lot of politically aware people believe she’s credible and that Scott Brown is vulnerable.”
But the gains were not enough for the first-time candidate to catch up with Brown, who has been bolstered by leftover funds from his 2010 campaign. Brown currently has roughly $15 million in his campaign till, while Warren’s camp has brought in roughly $12 million.
“Scott Brown still has $4 million more in the bank than we do, but this is the kind of support we need to be able to take on the big banks and corporations that are lining up against Elizabeth,” Myers wrote.
Both Warren and Brown have emphasized the grassroots, local nature of their campaigns.
Warren announced last week that her campaign had raised $2.5 million from 30,000 donors in Massachusetts. Eighty-three percent of those donations were $50 or less, and the donors came from 350 of the 351 cities and towns in the Bay State.
However, nearly twice as much, $4.4 million, of Warren’s first-quarter intake came from out of state. The consumer advocate and former Congressional adviser has fostered a great deal of enthusiasm among Democratic heavyweights around the country, and in Hollywood in particular, who have helped line her campaign coffers.
Republicans have criticized Warren’s financial support from outside Massachusetts, calling her hypocritical and out of touch with the common voter.
“Professor Warren’s fundraising continues to be mostly out-of-state money from extremely liberal donors and special interests that are trying to influence the Massachusetts election,” Brown spokesman Colin Reed wrote in an email.
Brown’s campaign said that 71 percent of its donations came from Massachusetts donors, but it has also been subject to some criticism in the past for its own out-of-state support.
“If this were a situation where Scott Brown wasn’t getting any money from out of state this might be an issue,” former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71 said. He added that the dynamic of political fundraising has changed in recent years, with races increasingly drawing national support.
As Warren inches closer to Brown in the cash race, the actual race for votes appears to be even tighter. The most recent election poll, sponsored by The Boston Globe, showed Brown and Warren statistically tied.

Startup companies are most likely to fail due to personal disagreements within their management teams, according to a new book by Noam T. Wasserman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School.
Released last month, “The Founder’s Dilemmas” focuses on the early decisions that a startup team is faced with and advises entrepreneurs on the best ways to navigate tough scenarios. According to Wasserman, choices such as whether to co-found, how to split equity, and whom to hire as the first employees often have drastic effects on the long-run vitality of a startup.
Wasserman’s book draws upon statistics and narratives he gathered from nearly 10,000 founders of technology and life sciences startups in the U.S. over the past 12 years. He tracks the individual experiences of founders as models of the early mistakes that he cautions future startups to avoid.
“If we can warn them [prospective founders] about those pitfalls, they will be able to be much more effective at bringing their ideas to the world and having the impact we want them to have,” Wasserman said.
For example, 73 percent of the founders in Wasserman’s survey made an equity split decision in the first month, resulting in many cases in an equal split among co-founders. Wasserman found that such a decision avoids tension within the team but often leads to problems when a co-founder decides to back out later on.
“That is where along the way you’re punting early on and avoiding a real discussion about commitment,” Wasserman said. “That is where you’re causing even bigger problems as you try to undo those early mistakes.”
According to Wasserman, passion and confidence often lead founders to see their companies in rosy terms while neglecting pitfalls. Failing to acknowledge these problems can come back to haunt a company later on.
“The model that I outline is having that really serious early discussion...about the really deep uncertainties that you still face,” Wasserman said.
Among other dilemmas, Wasserman’s book also studies the trade-off faced by many founders between maintaining control of a company and promoting its growth as an enterprise.
Just days after the book’s publication, it was the bestselling management book on Amazon.com.
“The Founders’ Dilemmas” is based on a course of the same name that Wasserman has taught at the Business School since 2009. The class was named one of the top 10 entrepreneurship courses in the country by Inc. Magazine in 2011.

Beginning on Tuesday, members of Harvard Human Rights in North Korea (HRiNK) will fast for 31 hours to raise awareness about the 31 North Korean defectors recently repatriated by the Chinese government. The defectors face imprisonment, forced labor, and possible execution in their native country.
For HRiNK co-president Rainer A. Crosett ’14, the fast is an opportunity to correct Harvard students’ misconceptions about North Korea.
“They have the image of the Kim family, you know, and nuclear weapons,” he said. “People don’t actually know that there are, for example, 200,000 people living in concentration camps.”
Crosett added that the organized fast highlights the daily reality of famine and food shortages for many North Koreans.
“I think it’s a wonderful idea because the experience of so many of the North Korean people and refugees is one of intense hunger,” he said.
HRiNK co-president Stephanie Choi ’13 said that the latest defections do not represent isolated incidents. She added that many North Koreans have previously risked imprisonment, torture, and death to reunite with loved ones in South Korea and escape oppression.
“This happened, and it’s not the first time it happened,” Choi said.
Fast participant and HRiNK member Ji Su Yoo ’15, who was inspired to become involved by her Korean heritage and Christian faith, said that the experience is also deeply personal.
“It has to do with awareness and it has to do with making myself more aware,” she said. “It’s about ignoring yourself, ignoring physical needs, to focus on more important things.”
The 31-hour fast is part of a series of events this week organized by HRiNK to raise awareness about North Korean human rights abuses, including a screening of the South Korean film “Crossing.” The film depicts a man who crosses illegally into China to buy medicine for his pregnant wife. The fast will conclude on Wednesday with a closing discussion featuring Professor Justin Jeon of Yonsei University and Jeong Young, a defector who is now a journalist for Radio Freedom Asia.
According to Crosett and Choi, the death of dictator Kim Jong Il presented a unique opportunity for activists to tackle the issue of human rights abuses in North Korea. Both HRiNK co-presidents said that they remained optimistic that non-governmental actors could bring about change and added that donations from the fast will be given to Love North Korean Children, an NGO that runs charity bakeries in the country and delivers food directly to North Korean citizens.
For Yoo, fostering a global perspective among future policy-makers at Harvard is also a major goal of HRiNK’s work.
“Everything is global. We can’t just look at our own issues, but see how everything is connected,” Yoo said. “North Korea is not so far away.”

After clinching a spot in the EIVA semifinals with its Friday night win over St. Francis, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was on the verge of a season-defining win against No. 7 Penn State.
But after Harvard started 2-0 in University Park, Pa., the Nittany Lions came roaring back into the match, tying the game at two before taking the decisive fifth game.
With the victory, Penn State maintained its perfect conference record and broke the Crimson’s five-game winning streak.
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 2
Riding the momentum from the previous night’s victory, Harvard (17-4, 9-3 EIVA) walked in knowing that Penn State (20-3, 13-0 EIVA) would likely be the team standing between the Crimson and a ticket to the NCAA tournament later this month.
And if the Crimson wanted to show the nation it can hang with the country’s elite teams, it did so in the first two games.
After finding his team down 12-6 early in the first set, Harvard coach Brian Baise called a timeout.
“Against a team like Penn State, you don’t come back from being down 12-6,” sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden said.
But the visitors found a way, as the squad soon began a nine-point run, capitalizing on six attack errors by the Nittany Lions to take the 16-13 lead.
After two timeouts of its own, Penn State tried to dent Harvard’s cushion. But after Madden’s service ace gave the Crimson a four-point advantage at 21-17, the teams traded points until Harvard took the first set, 25-20.
The early exchanges in the second frame were even, but at 11-11, the Crimson engineered a 4-1 run through two kills from co-captain outside hitter Matt Jones.
But the Nittany Lions did not relent and fought back to reduce the deficit to one at 21-20. Baise called a timeout to settle his team.
The timing proved prudent, as another 4-1 run handed Harvard the set, 25-21, and a 2-0 lead in the match.
The third set proved to be all Penn State, as the Nittany Lions jumped out to a commanding 15-9 lead before junior setter Derek Jansma received a yellow card. From there, Penn  State cruised, as Crimson attack and service errors gave the hosts a 25-13 victory and a foothold back into the match.
The Nittany Lions again took an early lead in the fourth stanza at 12-7. Though the Crimson kept it close the rest of the way, Penn  State held on to take the game, 25-21, and force a fifth set.
In the final frame, the Crimson could not break Penn  State’s momentum, as the EIVA’s No. 1 seed controlled the set early, running out with a 15-10 victory and another conference victory.
“If we would have been a little sharper the three games after [going up 2-0], we would have been able to take them,” Madden said. “We’ll see them again in the playoffs if we get past the first round, and we’ll see what happens.”
HARVARD 3, ST. FRANCIS 1
The Crimson began its Pennsylvania road trip in Loretto, where it put its four-game win streak to the test against St. Francis, the team chasing just behind Harvard in the league standings as the two teams head toward the EIVA playoffs.
The affair began very evenly. The Crimson and Red Flash traded throughout large parts of the opening set, with St. Francis maintaining the slightest of leads. But with the teams tied at 22, a service ace from Jones and two errors by the Red Flash allowed Harvard to take the 25-22 victory.
St. Francis fought back, grabbing a 25-22 win of its own in the second set to even the score.
But in the third frame, freshman outside hitter DJ White proved to be too much for the Red Flash. With the set even again at 21, White registered three late kills, leading the Crimson to the third-set victory. White finished the day with 20 kills, seven of which came in the third game.
“[Baise] matched me up against their setter, and it helped me get as many kills as I did,” White said. “[Junior setter] Rob [Lothman] was setting really well all night.”
Despite having to fight off a late rally from the Red Flash, Harvard took the match with a 26-24 fourth-frame win.
“We pulled it out because our defense improved and we stopped making hitting errors,” Madden said. “The only reason they were ever really in the game was because of our hitting errors.”
With the win, the Crimson has secured a spot in the EIVA tournament later this month, but the team knows the job is not done yet.
“I didn’t really expect we’d have the turnaround we did, from not winning more than a couple games in the league last year to being seeded second,” Madden said. “We’re excited, but we’re ready to work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-two seconds into the fourth quarter of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s 14-10 loss to Cornell Saturday afternoon, senior attack Jeff Cohen reared back, fired on net, and scored, just as he had 132 other times in his collegiate career.
But goal number 133 was not like any of Cohen’s previous tallies. This one guaranteed him a spot in the Crimson record books as Harvard’s all-time leading scorer, edging him past Dave Bohn ’61.
“The record has stood for a really long time, so it’s exciting to be a part of Harvard lacrosse history,” Cohen said.
The senior had steamrolled towards the record with seven goals, a career high, last weekend against Michigan, and then recorded a hat trick against the Big Red on Saturday to move past Bohn.
“He’s an outstanding player and a great person,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “[The record] is a testament to his hard work and dedication.”
For his part, Bohn could not have been happier to see his record broken.
“I’ve been waiting for someone to do it, and I’ve been watching,” Bohn said. “I can’t imagine how a record could last for however many years it’s been; somebody else should have it.”
Cohen, from Garden City, N.Y., has still only scored just over half as many goals in college as he did during his high school career—260—when he shattered the all-time Long Island scoring record of 236 that was previously held by Max Motschwiller ’09 and Dean Gibbons ’11.
The attackman was deemed the No. 4 recruit in the country following his senior season, and chose to follow in the footsteps of his brothers, Steve ’06 and Greg ’07, in playing lacrosse at Harvard.
Upon arriving in Cambridge, Jeff more than justified the high ranking and has proven himself to be the best of the Cohen trio.
The lefty led Harvard in scoring during a freshman campaign in which he registered 34 goals—good for ninth place on Harvard’s all-time single-season list.
He then followed that up by scoring 29 times as a sophomore and 31 times as a junior.
But this year, Cohen has turned in his best performance to date, registering a career-high 39 tallies that have placed him second in the country in goals and goals per game, behind only Colgate’s Peter Baum.
“[Cohen] has consistently played at a very high level for all four years,” Wojcik said.
With four contests still to go in the regular season, the attackman has a shot to challenge the school’s all-time single-season scoring record of 58—held by Dexter Lewis ’55 and Mike Faught ’79—as well as to continue moving his way up the Harvard career points list (on Saturday, he tied Gibbons for ninth place with 155).
Bohn, who now lives in New Hampshire, said that at Wojcik’s request, he was planning on coming to Harvard Stadium Tuesday night to be part of a ceremony before the Crimson’s game against Quinnipiac that will honor Cohen for breaking his record.
Bohn added that he still follows today’s Harvard squad, and though he has not yet met  Cohen, he looks forward to connecting with the young man who knocked him off the top of the Crimson career scoring list on Tuesday.
“I try to get down for two to three games a year, and I’ve watched [Cohen] for four years now,” Bohn said. “So it’s pretty exciting. Good for him.”
A humbled Cohen explained on Saturday that he would be better able to look back on his accomplishment when his senior season was over.
“It’s something that will be easier to reflect on in a few games, at least, but it’s definitely exciting,” the attackman said. “It’s something that’s due to a lot of hard work and a lot of help from my teammates and coaches.”
But with four regular season games and a potential playoff still to go, Cohen has a chance to secure his name atop the Harvard record books for a long time.
“The way he’s going, he’s not just going to break [the record], he’s going to squash it,” Bohn said. “He’s making it difficult for the next guy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew challenged Ivy League opponents this weekend in both crews’ second races of the dual season. The heavyweights traveled to Brown and retained the Stein Cup thanks to first-place finishes in four out of six races on the Seekonk  River.  The No. 1 lightweights also had a strong performance, winning three out of five races against Cornell and Penn on the Big Red’s home course.
HARVARD VS. BROWN
Three-fifths of a second was the narrow margin between victory and defeat in the first varsity eight’s race against the Bears on Saturday.  Battling the difficult conditions, Harvard took the lead fairly early and was out in front of the Brown crew by nearly a boat length.  But the Bears hung on and almost mounted a comeback, which made for a tight finish. The Crimson was ultimately able to complete the race in 5:25.4, edging out Brown by a boat deck to secure its second straight Stein Cup and extend its dual season winning streak to 15 races.
“It was definitely a tough one,” said captain Mike DiSanto, seven seat of the first varsity eight. “Brown is certainly one of our biggest opponents in the east and our dual race during my four years has evolved to be one of our most competitive races, so we were expecting that.”
The 2V race was not as close, as Harvard finished a length ahead of the Bears. 
The two freshman crews also came out strong against Brown.  The first freshman eight won in 5:32.1, while the second freshman eight finished in 6:23.5, two boat lengths ahead of the Bears.
A piece of debris that collided with and damaged the Harvard boat cemented the win for Brown in the third varsity race. The Bears were leading by only a length before the collision but then were able to record a 24.2-second victory over the Crimson crew.  The fourth varsity race was more competitive: The Bears held off Harvard by less than a second.
HARVARD VS. CORNELL, PENN
The Harvard lightweight crew traveled to Cayuga Lake Inlet in Ithaca,  N.Y., this weekend to race Cornell and Penn in its first Ivy League race of the dual season. Coming off of a five-race sweep of Delaware on March 24, the Crimson had another strong showing.
Under calm conditions, the Harvard first varsity eight, first freshman eight, and second freshman eight all topped their Big Red and Quaker counterparts. 
The second and third varsity boats fell to Cornell but held on to beat Penn.
In its race, the Harvard first varsity boat drew the outside lane, allowing the Crimson to start a seat up because of the turn in the race course.
Harvard took advantage, grabbing the lead coming out of the first 500 meters and finishing the race in 6:02.8. 
“We had a really good start, probably the fastest we have had in training or racing so far this season,” said junior Stuart Taylor, four seat of the first varsity eight. “It is really nice to come out for the Ivy opener and put in a solid race from start to finish.”
In the second varsity race, Cornell finished ahead of Harvard by 15.4 seconds, but the Crimson achieved an open-water victory over Penn.
 “We have improved a lot since our last race against Delaware,” said sophomore Zachary Connerton, seven seat of the second varsity eight. “We have a lot of work to do in terms of finding the sort of power it takes to stay with Cornell.”
The Big Red pulled ahead quickly, leaving Harvard down two seats off the start.  The Crimson was left to duel it out with Penn for second place.
“We were pretty even with Penn coming off the 500,” Connerton said. “Then we pushed ahead of Penn and held about a boat length and then some open water on them all the way through to the finish.”
The races this weekend brought the Harvard first varsity and freshmen boats to a 3-0 record on the dual season.
“Every win is just as exciting,” said sophomore Michael Wales, bow seat of the first varsity eight. “We just want to make sure that we operate and get the job done.  It’s great to beat an Ivy League opponent, and it’s a great extension to keep the train rolling from Delaware.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the start of its season, Harvard baseball faced some of the nation’s top-ranked squads—teams that outplayed it in a string of hard-fought defeats. Back at O’Donnell Field, the Crimson looked to have found its stride with wins in its first two home contests of the season. After topping Boston College on Wednesday, the Crimson beat Columbia, 6-2, on Saturday.
But home did not prove to be so sweet for the Crimson for the rest of the weekend.
Following a loss in the second half of a Saturday’s doubleheader against the Lions, Harvard was swept by Penn, 7-0 and 8-5, on Sunday.
In the second contest of the doubleheader, the Crimson racked up a total of seven errors, including three in a critical fourth inning.
“We’re not losing games because of what the other teams are doing. We’re essentially beating ourselves—not playing the game the right way,” junior Rob Wineski said. “It’s not always the team we’re playing; it’s the stuff we’re doing—walking people, making errors, not having good at bats.”
With the two losses, Harvard remains at the third spot in the Ivy League’s Rolfe Division just above Yale, which has still failed to record a single conference win.
Penn’s two wins were tempered by two losses at Dartmouth on Saturday, putting the Quakers in a tie for third in the Gehrig Division.
PENN 8, HARVARD 5
In the teams’ nightcap, Harvard (5-22, 2-6 Ivy) and the Quakers (14-12, 5-3) traded off runs in the opening frames. But although both continued to produce hits, the Crimson couldn’t find a rhythm and stranded 11 runners, crippling its offense.
“We just didn’t play our best ball today,” Wineski said. “We didn’t come through with some timely hitting that we have to have to win, especially in the Ivy League.”
With the score tied at two apiece, Harvard looked poised to take the lead in the second inning. With the bases loaded and one out as leadoff hitter sophomore Jack Colton stepped up to the plate. But the Crimson’s season-long frustrations continued, as Colton hit into an inning-ending double play.
In the third, sophomores Jake McGuiggan and Steve Dill, the latter of whom is currently leading the team with a .338 average, hit back-to-back sacrifice flies to drive in two Harvard runners and give the Crimson its only lead of the game.
But the Crimson advantage proved to be brief. The Quakers capitalized on three Harvard errors in the top of the fourth to scoring three unearned runs and grab the 5-3 lead.
Penn extended the Crimson’s deficit as the game went on, but due to a controversial ruling and a Harvard protest in the eighth inning, the game’s final decision will be under review by league officials.
PENN 7, HARVARD 0
In contrast to the later matchup, the Crimson and the Quakers found themselves in a stalemate in the early innings of the doubleheader’s opening game.
Harvard’s senior lefty Brent Suter kept Penn’s bats quiet for the first four frames, and the Quakers’ hurler Cody Thomson—who pitched a complete game for Penn— returned the favor, allowing a total of just five hits in seven innings.
The game looked like it had the potential to be a pitchers’ duel, as the fifth frame opened with the visitors leading, 1-0.
But the Quakers racked up five runs on four hits in the top of the inning, eventually climbing to a 7-0 lead and the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After shutting out Columbia in Friday’s doubleheader, the Harvard softball team kept the momentum going on Saturday, sweeping its two games against Penn, 4-3 and 10-1. After taking the first game by only one run, the Crimson (19-9, 7-1 Ivy) routed the Quakers (20-13, 5-3 Ivy) in five innings at home.
“These wins were huge,” said co-captain and first baseman Whitney Shaw. “This weekend has really helped us make our presence felt in the Ivy League.”
HARVARD 10, PENN 1 (5 inn.)
After taking the first game, 4-3, Harvard dominated the second game, both in the field and at the plate, grabbing a 10-1 victory against Penn in just five innings by mercy rule.
The Crimson swiftly grabbed an advantage in the first inning, as freshman second baseman Katherine Lantz singled up the middle with the bases loaded to bring home sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange and senior shortstop Jane Alexander. Junior centerfielder Stephanie Regan then scored on a wild pitch, and Lantz was plated in by junior left fielder Ashley Heritage’s single, extending the lead to four runs.
But it didn’t stop there.
In the second inning, Harvard cranked up the pressure on the Quakers, scoring two more runs to make the score 6-0.
Lange was the first one on base, getting hit by a pitch and advancing to second on a Regan single. Lantz ripped another single right after, allowing Lange to cross home. The final run of the inning came in as Regan scored on sophomore catcher Allison Scott’s ground out to second base.
“After we scored those first four runs, we came into the second inning knowing that we needed to keep scoring if we wanted to take over the game,” Shaw said. “So it was really important for us to keep producing runs in those next few innings and put the nails in the coffin.”
The Crimson offense tacked on three more runs on five hits in the bottom of the third inning to secure a nine-run lead.
Consecutive singles from Alexander and sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson loaded first and second base just in time for Lange, who leads the league with 22 RBIs. Last season’s Rookie of the Year sustained the offensive rally, singling past second base to drive in Alexander. Olson and Lange then each advanced a base on a passed ball, and Regan singled to left field to bring the two runners home.
In the fourth inning, the Harvard bats continued to produce, putting up one more run to increase its lead to double digits. Freshman designated hitter Andrea Del Conte singled to the shortstop and advanced to second on a steal. Alexander then smacked a triple, allowing Del Conte to score.
The Quakers attempted to make a comeback in the fifth inning but were only able to muster one run, and the game finished two innings early due to the mercy rule.
HARVARD 4, PENN 3
The first game of the day proved to be a pitcher’s duel, with co-captain Rachel Brown fanning 13 batters to lead the Crimson to a 4-3 victory.
Harvard started the contest exactly as it did in the second game, gaining an early four-run lead. But unlike the second game, the squad was unable to score again after this initial offensive outburst.
Alexander and Olson roped back-to-back singles to lead off the inning, and Lange walked to load the bases for Regan. Alexander and Olson then scored on Regan’s single up the middle, and Scott followed with a single that plated Lange. The Crimson earned its fourth and final run as Regan stole home on a wild pitch.
Despite losing some of its momentum at the plate, the squad kept up its energy in the field, keeping Penn off the scoreboard until the top of the fifth inning. At that point, the Quakers’ bats finally came alive, bringing in three runs to make it 4-3.
But that was the last time that either team brought a runner home, as the pitching duel heated up. In total, the sixth and seventh innings featured no hits and only one batter reached base.
“Our pitchers have been throwing their hearts outs,” Alexander said. “It’s amazing playing behind them and this weekend we were really able to work together to do what we needed to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the tale of two pitchers on Friday afternoon, as senior Rachel Brown and sophomore Laura Ricciardone combined for two complete-game shutouts to propel the Harvard softball team to back-to-back wins against Columbia. Brown and Ricciardone only allowed four hits total, while the Crimson posted 22 of its own in the 8-0 and 4-0 wins.
“That’s been one of the things that we’ve always wanted to work on, shutting teams out and setting the pace of the game to be our own pace,” co-captain Whitney Shaw said. “That was really crucial, to go in there...and show them that it was our game.”
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 0
After a dominant 8-0 victory in the first half of the day’s doubleheader, the Crimson (19-9, 7-1 Ivy) was able to pull out another sweep over the Lions (9-22, 3-5), who mustered only three hits against Ricciardone.
The win was Ricciardone’s seventh of the season.
“[Pitching a shutout] was great, but you know, the pitchers are only one part of it.... The defense is the bigger part,” Ricciardone said. “My defense was behind me and solid the whole game.”
Neither team was able to get on the board for the first four-and-a-half innings, but in the bottom of the fifth, Harvard finally found its rhythm, scoring four runs.
Freshman Katherine Lantz started the scoring with her second RBI single of the day, driving in sophomore Allison Scott—who was on base after a single of her own—to take the 1-0 lead. Lantz then helped extend the Crimson lead by stealing second, which allowed junior Jessica Ferri to score on the throw.
Harvard continued putting runs on the board after sophomore Shelbi Olson drove in two runs with a single up the middle, building the Crimson’s lead to four.  The Lions were unable to mount a comeback in the final innings, earning only one hit against Ricciardone to finish the day.
HARVARD 8, COLUMBIA 0 (6 inn.)
Thanks to dominating performances in the circle and at the plate, Harvard kicked off its four-game homestand with an 8-0 rout of Columbia.
“Every game in the Ivies has so much weight riding on it...and every win gets us that much closer to winning our division and making it to the championship,” Ricciardone said. “Everyone knew that, so we came out and did what we had to do.”
The Crimson took control of the game from the first inning with senior Jane Alexander leading off with a triple to right field, followed by an RBI single from Kasey Lange two batters later to put Harvard up 1-0.
Later in the inning, with the bases loaded, Scott came up with her own RBI single to bring two runners in. Lantz tacked on another with an RBI single up the middle to open the early lead to four.
The Crimson scored again in the second after junior Stephanie Regan drove in Lange, whose deep double to left center was nearly her fifth home run of the year.
Meanwhile, Brown kept the Lions at bay and allowed just one hit in the contest.
Both teams struggled offensively in the middle of the game, failing to score in the third, fourth, or fifth, but Harvard regained its footing in the sixth, plating another three runners to force the game to an early end by the eight-run rule.
Ferri delivered when the bases were loaded with an RBI to bring one in. Freshman pinch hitter Emily Gusse struck next, driving in the final two runs of the contest with a double to right field.
In the Crimson victory, Brown earned her 10th win of the season, while Regan recorded a game-high three hits. Also contributing for the Crimson were the rookies: Big plays from Gusse and Lantz helped secure the win.
“[The freshmen] bring so much energy in the dugout...and they are such a force on the field,” Alexander said. “They’re coming in at clutch situations and getting it done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the heavyweights visiting Princeton for an Ivy-filled regatta on Lake Carnegie and the lightweights defending home water on the Charles, both Black and White crews faced a series of familiar foes this past weekend.
The No. 11 Radcliffe heavyweights squared off against Ivy rivals No. 6 Princeton, No. 16 Cornell, and Columbia in the Class of 1975 regatta and won one of their three races, while the lightweights topped Georgetown to win the Class of 2004 Cup.
NO. 11 HEAVYWEIGHTS vs.
NO. 6 PRINCETON, NO. 16 CORNELL, COLUMBIA
In the 36th annual Class of 1975 regatta, the Black and White heavyweights faced three Ivy rivals and finished with one victory and two second-place finishes on Saturday.
In the 1V race, host Princeton launched off from the starting line to gain an early lead in the first 500 meters of the race, with Radcliffe also starting off strong to move into second place.
By the race’s halfway point, Cornell and Columbia had both closed the gap with the Black and White to create a heated battle for second place, while the Tigers remained firmly in control of the race in first place. With 500 meters left in the race, the Lions had moved into second place, while Radcliffe and the Big Red dueled for third place. In the final meters of the event, the Black and White were able to surge past Cornell to finish in third with a time of 7:20.
“Probably the most exciting part of our race was our sprint,” senior heavyweight rower Liz Soutter said. “We had a really strong sprint to the finish, so we managed to edge our bow to third place, which was really nice. It’s always good to beat out another boat right in the finish of a race and to see those moves become really effective.”
The Big Red finished a half-second behind with a time of 7:20.9. Columbia took second, five seconds behind first-place Princeton.
The Radcliffe 2V and varsity four A both finished second to Princeton with times of 7:20.4 and 8:10.1, respectively. The Black and White varsity four B surged past the field to record a nine-second victory over second-place Cornell in a time of 8:30.6.
“Every weekend, especially at this point of the season, we are learning a lot from every race,” Soutter said. “So I think that every boat figured out what it needs to work on for next weekend, which is always a good thing to go into a week’s worth of training knowing exactly what needs to be accomplished.”
NO. 4 LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. NO. 5 GEORGETOWN
In its first test of the dual meet season, the fourth-ranked lightweight squad faced off against No. 5 Georgetown on Saturday in what had been billed as a tough matchup against two equally strong lightweight programs.
But what transpired on the Charles River stood contrary to early predictions, as the Black and White lightweights stormed away to two easy victories against the Hoyas in the 1V and 2V races to record a sweep for the day.
With their final strokes in the water, the Radcliffe lightweights earned an important victory against a nationally ranked rival and their first trophy of the season, the Class of 2004 Cup.
In the 1V race, Radcliffe quickly established a fast-paced rhythm and pulled away early from Georgetown. After capturing a boat-length lead in the first 500 meters of the race, the Black and White never looked back, and its furious pace throughout the race powered the varsity crew to victory. By the race’s end, the Radcliffe 1V had extended its lead over the Hoyas to more than 11 seconds to finish with a time of 7:10.45, while Georgetown finished with a time of 7:21.80.
In the 2V race, the Black and White fielded two boats—the 2V and the novice eight—against the Georgetown 2V. The Radcliffe 2V recorded a time of 7:30.89 to beat the Hoyas 2V by a 13-second margin.
For the first 1,000 meters of the 2V race, the novices kept pace with the Hoyas but ultimately could not hold on in the final 500 meters of the race, as the Georgetown 2V opened up a gap against the novices. The Black and White novices ultimately finished in 7:48.04, four seconds after the Hoyas 2V.
“Our 2V did great against Georgetown, but the highlight of the day for us was our novice eight performance,” said junior lightweight rower Emma Lukasiewicz. “They really held their own against the Georgetown 2V, who had some experienced athletes versus our athletes who had just begun in the fall. Their performance really speaks to the depth of our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its opening weekend of Ivy League play, the Harvard women’s tennis team came out strong, defeating Cornell, 6-1, on Friday before mustering out a win over Columbia, 4-3, on Saturday at Beren Tennis Center.
Every Crimson player notched at least one victory over the two days, while senior Samantha Gridley, junior Camille Jania, and sophomore Hannah Morrill went 2-0 in singles play.
In doubles, the tandem of junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana and freshman Kelly Whelan also went 2-0 for the weekend in two close matches. Both contests went into extra games, but Tachibana and Whelan came out on top both times, 9-8 (5) against the Big Red, and 8-7 (5) against the Lions.
Harvard’s other doubles teams were not as consistent. The Crimson earned the doubles point only in its bout against Cornell when the duo of Gridley and Jania also got the win, defeating Gabby Sullivan and Rosemary Li on the No. 3 court.
“Having had a really tough match under our belts after this weekend and knowing we can come up with key shots in pressure situations will give us a lot of confidence going into next weekend,” Gridley said.
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 3
Coming off of a win in its first Ivy League match against Cornell the day before, the Crimson carried its momentum into its battle against the Lions, winning a close matchup.
Harvard started off in the hole after losing the doubles point in a trio of tight matchups.
Tachibana and Whelan got a win for the Crimson, defeating Bianca Sanon and Tiana Takenaga of Columbia in a tiebreaker at the No. 1 spot, 8-7 (5). But Morrill and junior co-captain Kristin Norton lost a close battle, 8-6, on the No. 2 court, while Gridley and Jania dropped their contest at the No. 3 position by the same score.
But the Crimson took hold of the singles matches.
At the No. 3 spot, Jania handled Iani Alecsiu, 6-1, 6-2, while Gridley took down Katarina Kovacevic on the No. 5 court, 6-2, 6-3.
Morrill also swept her foe in a 6-0, 6-4 match.
After just three decisions, the Crimson was within one point of the team victory.
But with Harvard up 3-1, the Lions’ Sanon beat Norton at the No. 2 position, 6-3, 6-3 to bring Columbia within one.
The final two matches took all three sets to find a winner.
Playing on the No. 1 court, Tachibana took the first, 7-5, while her opponent Nicole Bartnik, came back to win the second, 6-1. The final frame went into a tiebreaker with Bartnik finishing on top, 6-5 (5).
The deciding match came soon after Tachibana’s ended. On the No. 4 court, Blosser dropped her first set against the Lions’ Crystal Leung, 3-6, but rallied back to take the next two, 6-4, 6-3, giving the Crimson the match.
“Everybody played under pressure really well—especially Hideko and Natalie,” Gridley said. “Hideko staying on the court for Natalie’s whole match allowed Natalie to not feel a ton of pressure when the match came down to the two of them.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 1
Ivy play began on Friday when the Crimson outmatched the Big Red, bringing Harvard to 16-0 all-time against Cornell at home.
Unlike on Saturday, the Crimson began the afternoon by earning the doubles point.
Gridley and Jania teamed together to win, 8-6, at the No. 3 spot, while Norton and Morrill lost, 8-3, at the No. 2 position. Tachibana and Whelan took the tiebreaker in their match, 9-8 (5), on the No. 1 court to put Harvard ahead, 1-0, going into singles play.
The Crimson won five of the six singles matches, all in two sets.
Tachibana outplayed Sarah O’Neil at the No. 1 spot, 6-1, 6-0, while Norton also handled her foe, 6-1, 6-3, on the adjacent court.
At the No. 3 position, Jania handily won her first set, 6-1, but had to battle for the victory in the second, 7-6 (6).
Gridley and Morrill’s wins were also close at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots, respectively.
In extra games and a tiebreaker, Gridley beat Lauren Frazier, 7-6 (6), 7-5, and Morrill defeated Courtney Malinchak, 7-5, 7-5.
The Big Red’s only victory of the day came on the No. 4 court, when Sullivan beat Blosser, 6-1, 6-2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team spent the weekend on the road, travelling to Ithaca and New York City to kick off its Ivy League season. In its Friday matchup at Cornell, the No. 20 Crimson (17-2, 1-1 Ivy) stomped out the Big Red, emerging with a 7-0 victory to extend its winning streak to 13.
But when Harvard faced off against the No. 50 Lions (16-2, 3-0 Ivy) the next night, its winning streak was put to an end, as Columbia grabbed a 5-2 win.
“I don’t think [our] performances were very different,” senior Jonathan Pearlman said. “I thought we played equally well each day. I think there was just a discrepancy in the level of the other team.... It was more the other team’s performance that reflected [the different] outcomes.”
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 2
The Lions took an early win in the No. 3 doubles match, beating out junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen, 8-3. Harvard came back in the No. 1 match, in which the duo of senior Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster defeated Columbia freshmen Ashok Narayana and Max Schnur 8-5 to even the score at 1-1.
Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz won the doubles point for the Crimson, taking the No. 2 spot, 9-8 (8-6).
“That was really crucial that we won...the doubles,” said Pearlman, who dropped his singles match against Winston Lin, 6-1, 6-2.
Denis Nguyen regained the lead for the Crimson with a 6-4, 6-2 win at the No. 2 spot
But from that point on, it was all Columbia. The Lions took three successive third-set matches to clinch the win.
“[Columbia] is a good team,” Pearlman said. “In terms of the singles, [they] played very well in the third set in those matches.”
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 0
On Saturday, the Crimson competed at the Reis Tennis Center in a battle against the Big Red (6-14, 0-2 Ivy).  From the very beginning, the matched belonged to Harvard.
“We got off to a fast start in all the singles matches,” Felton said.  “We really put in a great performance and didn’t give them a chance.”
Andy and Denis Nguyen started off with an 8-5 win in their doubles match. The Big Red answered the threat by securing the No. 1 spot over sophomore Casey MacMaster and Felton in the second match of the day, but that proved to be the Crimson’s only loss of the day.  Pearlman and Schultz stepped in and downed the No. 2 Cornell doubles team, 8-3, to secure the doubles point for Harvard.
Pearlman carried the team’s momentum into the first singles match, coming out with a 6-3, 6-2 victory at the No. 1 spot.
The Crimson never looked back.
“It definitely was a challenge,” Felton said.  “I did not expect to beat them. I thought it was going to be a real scrap.”
Harvard found success in the remainder of the singles matches.
Denis Nguyen clinched his second triumph of the day at the No. 2 position, 7-5, 3-6, 10-8.  Freshman Shaun Chaudhuri faced a similar situation, also coming out on top in three, 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
Schultz easily overpowered his competition with a 6-1, 6-3 to add to the Crimson’s growing lead. Schultz’s victory clinched the Harvard win. The Crimson continued to roll as freshman Alex Steinroeder outplayed his opponent, 6-1, 6-4, followed by classmate Henry Steer, who concluded the shutout match with a 7-6, 6-2 win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Idle moments are hard to come by in the world of track and field.
While many students took the past weekend to travel home and spend Easter and Passover with their families, the Harvard track and field team was as busy as ever. The squad, split among three different meets, turned in a number of strong performances over the weekend, including some that earned event wins and were personal bests.
“We had an outstanding weekend,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was a busy weekend for us, with three competitions in three states, but I was very pleased overall with how our different groups performed.”
COLONIAL RELAYS
The Crimson only sent two representatives, sophomore James Leakos and senior Kailyn Kuzmuk, to the 47th annual Colonial Relays, hosted by The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. The pair of runners, who are also members of the Harvard cross country team, turned in top-10 finishes in the 5k and in the process earned spots in the Crimson record books.
Kuzmuk crossed the finish line in 16:34—the sixth fastest time in the event in Harvard history—en route to an eighth-place finish in the women’s competition.
Leakos followed suit, averaging a 4:29 mile in his race to finish in sixth place with a final time of 13:56.
“I took [the race] out a little conservatively,” Leakos said. “But I kept building and jumping to the next pack in front of me.”
When all was said and done, Leakos had run the fastest 5k of his collegiate career and had become the third Harvard runner to run a sub-14 minute outdoor 5k.
“[Leakos’ and Kuzmuk’s] performances were outstanding,” Saretsky said. “Both of those times in years past would get to them into the NCAA opening rounds.”
The duo was originally slated to compete in Princeton, N.J. to face off against Princeton’s elite distance team. But because many of the Tigers’ best distance runners competed in the 5000m run last weekend, Saretsky decided to send Leakos and Kuzmuk elsewhere to face tough competition.
SAM HOWELL INVITATIONAL
While Kuzmuk and Leakos were taking care of business in Williamsburg, another member of the cross country team, sophomore Maksim Korolev, was making waves in Princeton.
Korolev took home third place in the 1500m run on Saturday, finishing in just 3:57. The sophomore also competed in part of the 10,000m run on Friday night to get some experience racing the longer distances.
“Maks is doing great,” Saretsky said. “He is a couple weeks behind [Leakos] in his training, but I’m feeling good about how he is coming along…. This weekend was a major step forward for him.”
But Korolev was not the only member of the Crimson who progressed over the weekend.
Freshman Jarvis Harris, who broke the Harvard school record in the 60m hurdles during the indoor season, earned the event title in the triple jump and second place in the 110m hurdles.
Since the hurdles used in collegiate track and field are higher than those used at the high school level, Harris’ early success has caught the eye of his coaches.
“Making the transition as a freshman is a challenging, but Jarvis is very motivated and obviously cares very much about track,” Saretsky said. “He works hard, and it is great to see him being able to shine despite the transition.”
On the women’s side, junior Mary Hirst picked up an event win for Harvard in the high jump. Hirst cleared 1.75m to edge out Columbia’s Monique Roberts for the event victory.
“Mary has been a model of consistency for us all season long,” Saretsky said. “She does a great job every week, and I think as the season moves on, we’re going to see her soar to even greater heights.”
GEORGE DAVIS INVITATIONAL
Meanwhile at the George Davis Invitational in Lowell, Mass., a familiar name appeared at the top of the men’s pole vault results.
Junior Nico Weiler continued to have success in the event, as he cleared 5.20m to earn yet another event title.
“Nico is just a winner,” Saretsky said. “He’s a champion. He knows how to compete and does an outstanding job of rising to the occasion.... Everything is primed for him to be in his best shape down the stretch when it matters most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst freezing temperatures and snow quite irregular for an early spring afternoon, the Harvard baseball team packed into an electric street car in Harvard Square at 1:45 p.m. and headed to the opening day they had been preparing for all winter.
But the Crimson’s first game of 1912 was unlike any the country had seen before.
Coming off a 17-6 season under manager Frank J. Sexton, Harvard was going downtown, to the corner of Jersey and Landsdowne Streets. There, it would be playing the third installation of its annual matchup with the Boston Red Sox in the Sox’s brand new home, Fenway Park.
At approximately 3:30, amidst the snow, the wind, and the gray skies, Crimson third baseman Dana Joseph Paine Wingate, class of 1914, stepped up to the plate against Boston’s Casey Hageman as 3,000 passionate fans of America’s pastime looked on in anticipation.
Hageman wound, aimed, and fired, and on April 9, 1912—100 years ago to date—the first-ever baseball game at Fenway Park was underway.
***
Most in attendance at Fenway that chilly day had paid a nickel to arrive by streetcar, as there was no subway service to nearby Kenmore Square and few felt like walking thanks to the dreary weather.
Though there were certainly more people in the streets around the stadium than there were on a normal afternoon, it was truly only the diehards who had come out to see the Red Sox play an exhibition against the Harvard nine.  For almost everybody that lived in the area knew somebody who had worked on the construction of the new park, which until recent days had been easy to approach and get a good look at.
“A lot of people had already seen it, particularly the people in the neighborhoods around the stadium,” says historian Glenn Stout, the author of “Fenway 1912: The Birth of a Ballpark, A Championship Season, and Fenway’s Remarkable First Year.” “There was probably more interest from the people coming over from Cambridge and Harvard.”
Local Bostonians, most wearing homburg hats and heavy coats, lined up at the new ticket office at the north end of Jersey Street and waited patiently despite the strong winds. Many people from Cambridge already had tickets to the contest; the weekend before the game, The Harvard Crimson had informed readers that they could be purchased for 75 cents at both the Harvard athletic office and at Leavitt & Pierce in Harvard   Square. According to the article, boxes—if completed on time—could be purchased for between $1.35 and $1.50.
Once tickets had been obtained and spectators began to enter the stadium, fans who had purchased grandstand seats saw the words—“FENWAY PARK”—that make up the same red-letters-on-concrete sign visible to fans walking down Yawkey Way today. Those arriving for the contest on that overcast April afternoon only needed to hand their tickets to an usher, as the 18 brand new turnstiles the park was purported to feature would not be installed for another week.
As they stepped into the stadium, attendees came across high, cavernous walls and roof made of concrete (older stadiums, made of wood, tended to burn) situated above a dirt floor that would often become muddy on rainy days until the organization covered it in concrete two years later.
If they continued walking, fans would have been surprised to see that the new stadium contained two toilet rooms—a large one to accommodate gentlemen and a smaller one for women. They would have then followed the signs to the ramps that led to the grandstand, and as they reached the top, attendees would have gotten their first glimpse of the vast playing field.
***
As Wingate dug in against Hageman, he probably did not realize the magnanimity of the moment, nor the significance his name would one day hold as the first batter in the history of Fenway Park.
Indeed, the emotion most encompassing the sophomore from Winchester, Mass. was likely that of intimidation. Four years earlier, Hageman, the 25-year-old right-hander he was now facing, had thrown a pitch that had drilled Charlie “Cupid” Pinkey of the Dayton Veterans behind the left ear and subsequently killed him.
The hurler had been so mortified that he had taken the following season off, and after two years in the minor leagues in Denver, he was fighting to make the Red Sox squad.
“The papers said he was the $5,000 prospect,” says Red Sox Vice President Emeritus and Team Historian Dick Bresciani, referring to the seemingly extravagant price Boston had paid to purchase Hageman from the minors.
The Harvard roster was still wide-open as well; as The Crimson reported that day, “The make-up of the team is still unsettled, and in all probability nearly everyone will be given a try-out this afternoon.”
Though Wingate was a good bet to make the team, the third baseman was nonetheless overmatched by Hageman, who threw a first pitch ball before striking Wingate out on a series of fastballs.
Hageman then retired Crimson shortstop Dowd Desha and left fielder Richard Babson with ease to finish off a 1-2-3 opening inning.
***
Even though it was the park’s first game and the Red Sox had touted the appearance of “Old Timers”—a collection of Boston ballplayers from the 1860s onward—the public had shown very little interest in the contest.
“It’s important for anyone looking at [the opening of] Fenway 100 years ago to realize it was nowhere near as big a deal as it would be today,” Stout says. “Any anticipation was probably tempered somewhat by the fact that everybody was just trying to stay warm.”
Yet had anything close to a capacity crowd turned out, thousands of fans would have had nowhere to sit.
Indeed, the park was still very much a work in progress, with the construction shacks having only been removed a few weeks before. Much of the outfield was covered in footprints from the men who had worked tirelessly over the previous week to finish the bleachers and erect a fence to enclose the park.
As the game began, crews of workers continued bolting seats into the grandstand, working from the lowest rows up. Only a few thousand seats were then in place, while thousands of others were stacked beneath the stands, protected from the weather. They would not be installed for another few days.
In the concrete boxes down below, separated from each other by pipe railings, workers carried stacks of folding chairs up the ramps from below the stands and arranged them in neat rows. Fixed seats were never intended for the boxes.
Grass was sparse thanks to the weather, and outside the infield, bare ground dominated. In front of the fielders was an immense grandstand, 510 feet long from end to end. A mesh net that stretched from its roof was intended to protect fans from foul balls, but it did not yet cover the box seats.
On each side of the infield was a 40-foot-long concrete dugout, with the visiting Crimson along the third-base side. The dugouts contained a bench for the players to sit on, a set of concrete stairs leading to the field, and a pipe rail fence to prevent fielders from falling in while pursuing pop-ups. There was barely enough room for everyone to fit.
Simply put, according to Stout, “The park really wasn’t ready.”
***
On the mound for the Crimson was junior Sam Felton, class of 1913. The stocky son of a railroad magnate shed the heavy, full-length fur coat he was known to wear and toed the rubber. Better known as Harvard’s star kicker on the gridiron, Felton would be facing a Red Sox lineup that included most of its regulars, including the famed “Golden Outfield” of Duffy Lewis and future Hall of Famers Harry Hooper and Tris Speaker.
Though Felton would later be offered—and decline—a $15,000 contract by the Philadelphia Athletics, the hurler did not have his best stuff amidst the snow and struggled to find the plate.
“They were playing on a field that really, with the exception of the infield grass, was probably mostly mud, and was very slick,” Stout says. “It was a game that was pretty rough around the edges.”
Felton hung in against the major leaguers, getting Hooper to fly out to deep left to begin the home first. After Steve Yerkes singled to right for Fenway’s first hit, Felton got out of a bases-loaded jam to keep the game scoreless after one.
But after the Crimson again went down in order in the top of the second, the Red Sox broke through as Felton struggled with his control. Following walks to Marty Krug and Pinch Thomas—who advanced to second and third on an errant pickoff attempt in which, according to The Crimson, “No member of the University team [was] on hand to take the throw”—Hageman helped himself with a single to right, knocking in Krug for the park’s first run.
Felton got out of the inning with no further damage after Hooper flew out, Yerkes struck out, and Speaker was forced out at second following a walk.
***
With the poor ticket sales and even worse weather, the few seats in the stadium were sufficient for the 3000-person crowd, which consisted of many folks dressed in wool coats fit for the mid-30s temperatures.
“They had hoped to make a killing that day, and I think they probably hoped they’d get 10 or 12 thousand people,” Stout says. “But the weather was really poor, and that just didn’t happen.”
Indeed, there was not much about the afternoon that made it fit for baseball, and that limited the Red Sox’s interest in playing at all. The team had arrived in Back Bay Station the previous day after spending all night traveling by train from Cincinnati. Upon returning, many had stayed at Put’s on Huntington Avenue, despite the fact that the hotel was much closer to their old stadium—the Huntington Avenue Grounds—than their new one. Others had secured accommodations at the Copley Square Hotel, about twenty minutes by foot from Fenway.
The following afternoon, the squad headed to Park Riding  School on Ipswich Street to pick up their uniforms, as the Fenway clubhouses were still unfinished. The players were dressed in their home whites, with the words “Red Sox” emblazoned across their chests in red, and they wore white woolen caps and white socks with a wide red stripe that surrounded their calves and gave them their nickname. From the school, they walked to the park in uniform, though they were in no rush to get to the stadium and so remained in their makeshift clubhouse playing cards and stuffing tobacco until the last possible moment.
The Crimson players, likewise, were in no hurry to head over from campus, where they had dressed. Though Harvard was excited to play on a big league field, the occasion marked the first time all year that the team would even have the chance to play on a real field at all. Most of the Crimson’s practices to that point had taken place indoors, and the team had yet to play a game outside.
“Previous to this,” The Crimson reported on April 6, “the battery men had been working in the cage since the mid-year period; fielding candidates except ‘H’ men since the first of March, and the ‘H’ men since March 18.”
Upon arriving at the stadium, the players who had passed those tryouts and made the team began to warm up, many wearing heavy wool sweaters to fight the cold. Those in the crowd—which, according to the Boston Globe’s Mel Webb, consisted of a “lust-lunged following” from Harvard—were also able to literally warm up thanks to the free coffee, heated by large urns, that was being distributed below the stands.
***
Hageman, a 5’10”, 186-pound hurler, was in mid-season form following Spring Training in Arkansas. The righty continued to mow down the Crimson as the game wore on, holding Harvard hitless through four.
“He was throwing fastballs by the Harvard players,” Stout says.
But Felton held his own against the Red Sox hitters, keeping his team down just a run as the game moved to the fifth.
“The Boston men were not able to hit Felton very hard,” Webb wrote the next day. “While he was always at odds with the plate and had the short end of the corner decisions that were made by Umpire Jack Stafford, Felton had [a] deceptive change of pace.”
In the fifth, Harvard got its first hit when captain and second baseman Robert Potter, class of 1912, struck a well-placed single through the hole between short and third. But Hageman picked off Potter after he had stolen second and got out of the inning unscathed. The pitcher then added another RBI hit following a Larry Gardner single and a Krug walk in the bottom of the inning to give his team a 2-0 lead.
The Crimson nearly got on the board in the top of the sixth, but after walking and taking second and third on passed balls, centerfielder Richard Bowditch Wigglesworth, class of 1912, was gunned down at the plate trying to score on a double steal.
By that time, the snow was falling more heavily, and a cold wind had begun to blow in from the northwest.
***
Above the grandstand directly behind home plate was a wooden press box that contained accommodations fit for up to 16 telegraph operators. Inside sat writers from the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Boston Journal, and the Boston Post. Beside them was a keyboard that would be used to operate the new electric scoreboard in left field that—like so much else on that opening day—had yet to be fully installed and would not be utilized until April 20.
Past first base sat an open-alley pavilion about 10-to-15 feet wide where another 1000 or so fans crammed together in the lower section of the wooden bleachers. The area was tilted towards the field so its most distant corner created the start of the outfield wall that down the line was only 300 feet away.
From the pavilion’s front end, a bare wooden fence of eight-foot-tall vertical planks angled back and met the centerfield bleachers more than 400 feet from home plate. The bleachers, rectangular in shape, contained over 40 rows of seats and extended almost as far back as Lansdowne Street, which ran behind them. There were no advertisements hanging anywhere, a fact that would change by the end of the season.
A large flagpole just a few feet from the back fence towered over the bleachers. In dead center field sat an open area in the shape of a triangle, and at its peak the park was at its deepest, 488 feet from home plate.
“Though it was the dead-ball era, a ball could roll a long way under the right conditions,” Bresciani says.
From there ran the left-field fence—at that time neither green nor a monster—which sat above an embankment of earth that few paid much attention to because nobody thought someone would be able to hit the ball far enough for the mound to come into play. The 12-foot hill, later nicknamed “Duffy’s Cliff” after the Red Sox left fielder, was used for structural purposes; since Fenway  Park was built higher on the Lansdowne Street side, the left field side of the park had to be raised in order to make it level with the remainder of the stadium. But with the wall set to be built atop the rise still unfinished, those standing on the roof of the Boston Garage Company behind the park could see into the stadium without buying a ticket.
Another tall fence met the grandstand on the third-base side, leaving a wide expanse of space between the foul line and the seats. Some suggested the area would make an ideal place for pitchers to warm up, but such “bullpens” were not commonplace at the time.
Lastly, above a scaffolding that hung from the top of the wall near the left-field line, two anonymous workmen sat and took in the contest, becoming the first two spectators to watch a game from roughly the same viewpoint as those who sit above the Green Monster today.
***
By the seventh inning, the impatient crowd—which, according to the Boston Herald, “rattled around like a squadron of lima beans in a number eight hat”—had begun to lose interest amidst the weather that grew colder as darkness came.
It had become increasingly difficult for players to see the ball, and after Hageman collected his ninth strikeout to end top of the inning, the Red Sox had decided they had had enough as well. Manager and first baseman Jake Stahl brought Stafford over to the dugout and to everyone’s relief, the game was called. With a final score of Red Sox 2, Harvard 0, it had lasted just one hour and 38 minutes.
Felton finished with 10 walks but only allowed four hits while stranding 13 baserunners, helping him limit the Red Sox damage. As The Crimson remarked the next day, “It was an extraordinary game in this respect, for rarely does a pitcher hold his opponents to two runs when giving passes at the rate of two an inning.... Had it not been for his wildness [Felton] would have pitched very credible ball.”
Though Harvard managed just one hit, The Crimson reported that defensively, “Harvard played a fairly clean game in the field, Felton’s error of judgement in throwing to second when there was no one on the bag, and a muff of a high fly by Wigglesworth, being the only misplays.”
The Globe added that “On the whole...the college players did very well in the field, although they were shy with the hickory. Potter, Clarke, and Wingate made one double play that set the professionals thinking, while out in center field Wigglesworth picked out two hard balls as they came swooping along through the snowflakes.”
On the whole, as Webb admitted on April 10, the game “did not amount to a great deal.” But many raved about the new ballpark, with Herman Nickerson of the Boston Journal saying that “When it is finished, it will be the best in either major league circuit.”
The Red Sox left by train for New York the following day and played their first contest of the season at Hilltop Field against the New York Highlanders—who would become the Yankees the following year—on April 11. The two teams played the first official game at Fenway, a 1-0 Boston win, nine days later.
The season would be a tremendous success for the Red Sox, who finished 105-47 in the regular season and then topped the New York Giants, 4-3, to win the 1912 World Series in a thrilling eight games (game two ended in a tie).
Hageman would only appear in two contests, in which he compiled an ERA of 27.00. He played just one more season after that one.
“He didn’t really have much of a career,” Bresciani says. “He never really lived up to what they hoped he would.”
But Speaker won the AL MVP behind a .383 batting average, 90 RBI, and 52 steals while starter Smoky Joe Wood led the league with 34 wins.
Things wouldn’t go as smoothly for Harvard, which finished 12-10-1. But the Crimson would continue improving in the years to come and would go 22-3-1—including its first win over the Red Sox—four years later.
***
Today, the Harvard baseball team is set to return to Fenway Park and take batting practice where its predecessors were defeated amidst the snow 100 years earlier.
“All the guys are really excited about it,” junior Robert Wineski says. “It’s not every day that you get to have batting practice in a major league ballpark.”
“It’s really an honor to be able to do something like this,” senior Brent Suter adds. “To represent Harvard’s program while out there will be quite special—there’s not a better ballpark in the country than Fenway.”
In the century following its initial game, the stadium has undergone a number of transformations.  The corner of the right field pavilion that edged onto the field became today’s section six, the wide space along the third-base foul line evolved into today’s sections 28-33, and the left-field wall would not be painted green for another 35 years.
“If someone from today were to be magically transported onto the pitcher’s mound in Fenway  Park [in 1912], I don’t think they would recognize the place,” Stout says.
But despite those changes, the awe the initial spectators felt upon entering Fenway—now the oldest Major League stadium still in use—was the same as the wonder felt by the millions of people who attend a game there during a season today.
“It’s great that it’s been able to last 100 years because of the significance—what it means to fans and players who can still come in and think about Babe Ruth and Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski,” Bresciani says.
Though names like Felton, Wingate, and Wigglesworth don’t hold the same weight in baseball lore, the Harvard trio did do one thing those Hall of Famers never did—christen the ballpark that would become a national landmark.
“Our tours are so successful throughout the year with people all over the country and even foreign lands,” Bresciani says. “Fenway has gotten to be an icon around the country.”
And though the park’s first game was to the players more a burden than a blessing, the Boston Globe put it best the following day: “But it was an opening, and that was something.”

If you're anything like me, when you sit down to study with music, you may inevitably find yourself writing "I'm lost in the world / I'm down on my mind" instead of defining relevant aspects of life history theory. Watching TV while completing a problem set? The last time I tried that, I waxed poetic about Liz Lemon's dominant alleles. No, homework requires something else—something without distracting words or images. So whether you're tackling a paper or problem set, movie scores are a surefire accompaniment. The Arts Board presents you with eight classics.
"Mombasa" from "Inception" (Hans Zimmer)
The off-kilter percussion! The ominous horns! Your inspiration begins to flow. Just visualize Leo sprinting through his dream-world crimes. You're sure your professor planted the answer to this question somewhere deep within your subconscious. Perhaps a nap would help?
"See You Tomorrow" from "How to Train Your Dragon" (John Powell)
Whimsical at the beginning, soaring at the end. You're riding on a dragon of creativity. Nothing can stop you from figuring out your thesis! Nothing!
"Hymn to the Sea" from "Titanic" (James Horner)
Oof—writer's block. It's okay to give in to desperation a bit. Drown your sorrows with this mournful bagpipe dirge.
"The Bridge of Khazad Dum" from "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" (Howard Shore)
Traverse the mines of Moria, evade the Balrog, and mourn Gandalf's death, all from the comfort of your Lamont armchair. If the keening lament at the end can't get you to think of something new to say about "Romeo and Juliet," you may be out of luck.
"2815 A.D." from "WALL-E" (Thomas Newman)
Circumvent skyscraper-high mounds of garbage alongside a plucky but lonely little robot. It's an engineering marvel! Just like your problem set!
"A Legacy of Comfort" from "The Virgin Queen" (Martin Phipps)
Now you've got your flow going. The paragraphs are breezing by, and a little Elizabethan accompaniment can't hurt.
"Red Sea" from "The Prince of Egypt" (Hans Zimmer)
Because it's Passover. And because the fact that you debugged your code and still have time to sleep may be as miraculous as God parting the Red Sea after all.
"Promontory" from "The Last of the Mohicans" (Randy Edelman and Trevor Jones)
As Natty Bumppo races across the Appalachians to save his lover, you too sprint through the final equations to finish with appropriately euphoric and cinematic joy.

Fellow Cambridge residents, rejoice!
According to GoLocalProv.com, Cambridge's unbeatable air quality—ranked number one in Massachusetts—and its thriving culture and diversity earned our fair city the title of the number one city in New England. The report cites Cambridge's highest median income and lowest unemployment rate in Massachusetts as well as the statistic that 72.4 percent of Cambridge's adult population hold a bachelor's degree or higher.
Also, according to MSNBC, Cambridge is the most walkable city in the country, thanks to the beautiful architecture, which ranges from the modern skyline around MIT to the historic ivy walls of Harvard Square.
