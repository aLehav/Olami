After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re less than two weeks away from Broadway’s biggest night—The Tonys—and there are still so many questions that need answering. Will hosts Josh Groban and Sara Bareilles have the chemistry to beat legendary four-time host Neil Patrick Harris? Will Lin-Manuel Miranda take home an award—despite not being nominated this year? While I can’t answer all (or really any) of these questions, the absolute least I can do is give you my predictions for who will take home silver on June 10.
Best Musical: "The Band’s Visit"In a category otherwise populated by young-adult and child favorites (“Mean Girls,” “Spongebob Squarepants: The Broadway Musical,” and “Frozen”), “The Band’s Visit” is the obvious pick for Best Musical. The show follows an Egyptian band stuck in a small Israeli town for a night as they wait to catch the bus to their next performance. The show was a favorite with critics for its intimacy and powerful performances and is the category’s lone dramatic contender. Unless the Tony voters are registered in Bikini Bottom, “The Band’s Visit” is the clear favorite to take home the top prize at the Tonys.
Best Play: "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"If the never-ending saga of books and movies has you avoiding any mention of the words “magic,” “wizard,” or “Hogwarts,” feel free to skip to the next category because John Tiffany’s “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is a shoe-in to take the prize for Best Play. Critically acclaimed and grossing around $2 million in the first two days of its release, the two-part dramatic epilogue to “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” benefits from standout performances from actors Anthony Boyle (Scorpius Malfoy) and Jamie Parker (Harry Potter), as well as Tiffany’s masterful creation of a world of magic onstage. Quality of plot and performance aside, the show’s $68.5 million budget—the biggest for a play in the history of Broadway—certainly doesn’t hurt its chances for success.
Best Revival of a Musical: "Once on This Island"The Michael Arden helmed revival of “Once on This Island,” equal parts whimsy and tragedy, brings the French Antilles to life on the Broadway stage. A stellar cast, beautiful visual effects, and an enchanting, Caribbean-inspired score set this musical fable apart from peers “Carousel” and “My Fair Lady” in the race for this category. Hailey Kilgore’s Broadway debut as Ti Moune is dazzling and accompanied by standout performances by Broadway-favorite Lea Salonga (Erzuli), “Glee” actor Alex Newell (Asaka), and so many more. If Asaka (Mother of the Earth) has anything to say about it, this stellar cast won’t be disappointed come Tony night.
Best Revival of a Play: "Angels in America"A well-done production of “Angels in America” anywhere is a gem, but a revival of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer-Prize winning epic on Broadway starring Andrew Garfield (Prior Walter) and Nathan Lane (Roy Cohn) is something otherwordly. A National Theater transplant directed by Marianne Elliot, the “Angels” revival takes an oft-produced, critically-acclaimed play and builds something completely unique out of it. The scenic design, courtesy of Ian MacNeil and Edward Pierce, is alternatingly fantastic and scaled-back, but doesn’t steal focus from its array of career-defining performances. Spectacularly acted, directed, scored, and designed, it’s hard to picture a reality where “Angels in America” doesn’t take home a deserved Tony for Best Revival of a Play in June.
Best Leading Actor in a Play: Andrew Garfield, "Angels in America"Andrew Garfield has been nominated for Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globe Awards for his work in film, but no previous performance (no, not even his stint as Spider-Man) compares to his portrayal of Prior Walter in “Angels in America.” Garfield is practically unrecognizable, immersing himself in the role of Prior, a gay man struggling to preserve both his relationship and his sanity after being diagnosed with AIDs and having visions of spirits. The humor, personality, and heart-wrenching emotion Garfield exudes as Prior throughout the two full-length performances that comprise the play is a miraculous feat. He called the role the “privilege of his life,” and Tony voters are almost certain to agree.
Best Featured Actress in a Play: Denise Gough, "Angels in America"I promise this will be the last you hear about “Angels in America”—at least until the telecast itself. Less talked about than co-stars Lane and Garfield but equally deserving of praise is Denise Gough’s stunning performance as Harper Pitt, a valium-popping, agoraphobic, Mormon housewife. Gough emotionally grounds Harper without sacrificing her head-in-the-clouds spaciness and, as the play intensifies, gives a masterclass in breaking down onstage without a second of it feeling like “acting.” Her performance can evoke both laughs and shivers in the same monologue and is bound to garner some love in the form of a small silver statue.
Best Direction of a Musical: Michael Arden, "Once on This Island"Snubbed by the Tonys in 2016 for Best Director of a Musical for Deaf West’s revival of “Spring Awakening,” Michael Arden is due for some awards love. The 35-year old actor-turned-director may have lost out to “Hamilton” before, but his direction of “Once on This Island” is a standout in this year’s category. He brings an upbeat and enchanting feel to a lovely but tragic fable, making for a captivating experience (even when it’s time to learn the lesson).
Best Book of a Musical: Tina Fey, "Mean Girls"We all love Tina Fey. We all love “Mean Girls.” Tina Fey brought “Mean Girls” to Broadway. Outside of personal (and generational?) bias, Fey’s laugh-out-loud book is the most celebrated part of the new musical.Who doesn’t want to see the beloved comedian deliver what is bound to be an entertaining acceptance speech for Best Book of a Musical? The Tony voters certainly will.

Now that “Avengers: Infinity War” has been out for a few weeks, it’s time for yet another Marvel-based superhero movie featuring a villain played by Josh Brolin. This time, Brolin plays Cable, a murderous cyborg soldier from the future, and his character is opposed not by a bloated procession of cameoed Avengers, but by Deadpool (a very much in-his-element Ryan Reynolds) and friends (most notably Zazie Beetz as Domino, a new character whose superpower is good luck). The awkward optics of Brolin’s quasi-double-casting aren’t lost on Deadpool, who jokingly refers to Brolin’s character as Thanos (the rock-stealing antagonist of “Infinity War”). This brand of metacinematic self-awareness is highly characteristic of the humor in “Deadpool 2.” Deadpool seems to know that he’s actually Ryan Reynolds and that the events of his life are determined by “the studio.” One might estimate that three in every four one-liners are riffs on Marvel characters or franchises, and one joke, which is featured in the trailer, even takes a dig at the rival DC Universe. In all its smug self-awareness, however, “Deadpool 2” somehow avoids crossing the line from funny to tiresome, at least for the most part.
While some action-comedies sacrifice coherent plotlines in favor of humor and violence, “Deadpool 2” manages a decent dose of all three. Shortly after being taken in as an X-Man trainee, Deadpool lands himself in a high-security prison alongside a 14-year-old mutant pyromaniac named Russell (Julian Dennison), whom Cable is determined to kill. To fight Cable and protect Russell, Deadpool forms a band of mutants called X-Force, and the team struggles against Cable and his weaponry from the future. Though time travel can render some films unnecessarily complicated, “Deadpool 2” avoids these problems by treating the issue with such joking nonchalance that any plot holes or temporal paradoxes become inconsequential; to notice them or point them out would be to miss the point.
By not taking itself seriously as an X-Men movie or a superhero movie or a movie at all, “Deadpool 2” makes only one promise, and it delivers: It’s damn funny, and it’s a damn good time. Ryan Reynolds could not be a better fit for the character of Deadpool. Once again, he brings the exact energy and charisma the character requires, and he could carry the film himself if he needed to. Even so, 15-year-old Dennison has plenty of comedic and dramatic talent to offer, as does Morena Bacarrin, who is given far too little screen time as Deadpool’s love interest Vanessa. That being said, the film rather refreshingly avoids being weighed down by a half-baked ensemble cast; save for Domino, who plays a more prominent role, the various members of X-Force featured in the film’s trailer deliver their share of comedy in an appropriately short amount of time.
Despite its many, many layers of irony, however, “Deadpool 2” has some genuinely heartrending moments. Some of the scenes between Deadpool and Vanessa are real tearjerkers, especially for those who watched them fall in love in the first movie. “Deadpool 2” is unexpectedly wholesome. It achieves a unique and surprising balance of sentiment and cynicism, allowing characters to express their grief, affection, and vulnerability without veering too close to the saccharine.
Of course, “Deadpool 2” is not without its flaws. Without giving too much away, both Deadpool and Cable are defined by the loss or suffering of their female loved ones, who exist largely for plot or male character development but don’t function as full characters themselves. This type of asymmetry in the treatment of male and female characters has a long history, particularly in comic books and comic book-inspired media. There’s even a ’90s feminist website called “Women in Refrigerators” (so named for a comic book scene in which the corpse of a superhero’s girlfriend is found in a refrigerator) listing female comic book characters who have been “killed, raped, depowered, crippled, turned evil, maimed, [or] tortured,” often in service of male superheroes’ character arcs. More recently, bloggers have termed this “the fridged girlfriend trope” and criticized the misogyny inherent in using women as plot devices and repeatedly representing them as victims of horrific tragedy. Even if one were to ignore the sexist overtones of the fridged girlfriend phenomenon, it is disappointing to see a film that aims to be subversive rely on such an overused trope.
In a similar vein, there’s some troublesome invocation of racial stereotypes throughout “Deadpool 2,” mostly surrounding Deadpool’s timid Indian taxi driver Dopinder (Karan Soni) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead’s quirky anime-looking new girlfriend Yukio (Shioli Kutsuna). Given how irreverent, deeply ironic, and winkingly self-aware “Deadpool 2” is, it might seem unreasonable to criticize the film for not representing minorities in a sufficiently socially responsible way. Still, relying on stereotypes to fill a joke quota seems rather lazy and makes for moments that are more cringe-inducing than funny. Save for the light sprinkling of misogyny and racism, though, “Deadpool 2” is a film worth watching.

"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society” is the kind of film that you come across accidently. Despite its loud, mouthful of a name, this film is a quiet but delightful surprise. It’s not that one doesn’t expect much from it, but rather that a movie with such a title is either ignored before reaching the fourth syllable or etched into memory.
This period drama, beautifully directed by Mike Newell, is based on the eponymous novel by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. It centers on Juliet Ashton (Lily James) a young writer living in London who has made a name for herself after publishing a collection of short stories about the war. In 1946, she begins communicating with a farmer across the channel, Dawsey Adams (Michiel Huisman), about a literary society he belongs to called The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. She is intrigued and travels to the island to write about it. There, she meets the other members: Isola (Katherine Parkinson), Eben (Tom Courtenay), and Amelia (Penelope Wilton).
During the German occupation, this group came together inadvertently, finding unity and comfort in the books that they discussed as well as in each other’s company. The puzzling disappearance of one of its members, Elizabeth McKenna (Jessica Brown Findlay), however, casts a shadow on their lives. Due to the general lack of mystery around Elizabeth and her disappearance, Juliet decides to stay in Guernsey to piece together the past events.
Besides its intricate plot, the film’s characters and the wonderful actors who portray them are some of its strongest assets. Juliet is an intriguing and passionate woman, doing all she can to find out the truth about Elizabeth and help the members of the Society heal from the trauma of the occupation. She also bravely perseveres to find her own happiness. James plays this role with sensitivity, imbuing Juliet’s struggles with dignity and strength. In this role, she is so charming that you cannot help but fall in love with her character and spirit. Michiel Huisman is also a lovely addition to the cast, making us understand Dawsey’s guardedness and reticence clearly. He and James gravitate to each other easily, such that the development of their relationship is one of the best parts of the film.
Parkinson and Courtenay infuse their whimsical characters with a lightness and humor that balances the bitterness that Wilton’s Amelia brings to the film. Though they are not your usual stock comic relief, their easy humor is expected. It proves to be quite necessary to keep the atmosphere from being too heavy. While she mostly appears through flashbacks, Findlay’s Elizabeth is courageous and bright—a force of surety. Though her ultimate fate is not surprising, Juliet’s investigation into her disappearance is kept suspenseful throughout the film.
While plenty of WWII romances and book club comedies have come before it, “Guernsey” does a fine job of combining these elements into one in a new way. It differentiates itself by delicately unfolding the plot. Though a lot is packed in, its story and twists are never obvious, fluttering between scenes after the war and during the war. In a way, it even feels incredibly reminiscent of old WWII movies like “South Pacific” (1958). It is not nostalgic per se, but it has an old-fashioned aspect that brings a certain kind of warmth that those movies also sought to inspire. Costume designer Charlotte Walter is to thank for this feeling with her authentic designs. James in particular sports a wide array of fashionable and enviable numbers, which change over the course of the film to reflect her character development.
“Guernsey,” for all its long title, is absorbing. It combines a great cast with an intriguing plot and characters. It’s not necessarily revelatory, but it is a wonderful nugget of a film. Whether due to its acting, sprawling shots of beach, or even its difficult name, it is sure to stay with you for some time after watching it.

Vice President of the Harvard Library Sarah E. Thomas will retire at the end of this year, according to the Harvard Gazette.
Thomas, who assumed the role of vice president in 2013, also serves as a University librarian and as the librarian of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
In a letter to Harvard affiliates, Thomas wrote that she was proud of her library colleagues, calling them “innovative, deeply knowledgeable, and dedicated to service.”
“It has been an immense privilege to have been shaped through the association with the world’s greatest library and to have been one in the series of men and women who have guided it forward,” Thomas wrote.
University President Drew G. Faust, who will step down herself this June, told the Gazette Thomas has “reimagined what a University library can be.”
“Her insight and ability to bring people together has enriched research, teaching, and learning at Harvard, and her many contributions will affect the ease with which students and faculty can access our extraordinary resources for years to come,” Faust said.
During her tenure, Thomas said she sought to achieve Faust’s goal that the University become “One Harvard” by developing user-oriented services meant to better connect faculty, students, alumni, and researchers with library resources both online and in-person.
Thomas also expanded access to the library’s resources by digitizing them for use by scholars around the globe and spearheaded partnerships with peer institutions.
In a letter to Harvard faculty, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote Thomas is a “true embodiment of the spirit of One Harvard.”
“Working with Sarah over the past five years and witnessing the library’s progress during that time has been a pleasure,” Garber wrote.
Thomas has also played a role in expanding access to Harvard’s libraries on campus. She opened Pusey Library to the public after more than decade. The library has since supported public exhibitions from the University’s libraries, including a popular four-month showing of the Harvard Map Collection’s ink-drawn maps. Thomas was also involved in the design of the new Cabot Science Library, which opened in April 2017.
Before coming to Harvard, Thomas worked in many of the world’s most prestigious libraries. In 2007, she was appointed the Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford, becoming the first woman and non-British citizen in 400 years to hold the position. Thomas also served as the director of the Bodleian Libraries for five years until 2013.
Prior to this role, Thomas worked as Cornell’s University Librarian for over a decade from 1996 to 2007. Thomas has also held administrative positions at the Library of Congress, the National Agricultural Library, and the Research Libraries Group. She began her career at Harvard in 1970, where she worked to file cards into Widener Library’s official catalog.
