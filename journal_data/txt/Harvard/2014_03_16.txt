After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 20 New Mexico Lobos from the Mountain West.
Record: 26-6, 15-3 Mountain West
Best Wins: #8 San Diego State, #13 Cincinnati
Worst Losses: New Mexico State, UNLV, Boise State
RPI: 18
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 48
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 6
Star Players: Cameron Bairstow (Sr. Forward) 20.4 ppg, 7.3 rpg, Kendall Williams (Sr. Guard) 16.4 ppg, 5.0 apg
After knocking off New Mexico in one of last year’s biggest NCAA tournament upsets, the Crimson could once again find itself paired up with the Lobos on Selection Sunday. Both New Mexico and Harvard graduated just one starter from last year’s squads, so this game could potentially be one of the most interesting second-round matchups.
With senior forward Cameron Bairstow and junior center Alex Kirk, the Lobos boast one of the best frontcourts in all of college basketball. Following a disappointing performance against the Crimson in last year’s tournament, Bairstow dramatically improved his game over the summer and has been one of the nation’s best forwards this season. The seven-foot Kirk put up 22 points and 12 boards against Harvard last year and has continued to be a dominant force in the middle.
If the Crimson takes on the Lobos in the second round, senior forward Kyle Casey and junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi will be tasked to contain the duo of Kirk and Bairstow. Harvard has struggled to defend opposing big men at times this season, which would be a major issue against the Lobos. Yale freshman forward Justin Sears had over 20 points and 10 rebounds in both games against the Crimson, and he gives up an inch and 45 pounds to Bairstow. Moundou-Missi and Casey will have to find a way to defend the New Mexico big men without getting into somewhat characteristic early foul trouble.
But while Bairstow has been an offensive force all year long, he has struggled to defend smaller, quicker forwards who can spread the floor. He had to chase then-junior Laurent Rivard and then-senior Christian Webster around the court in last year’s second-round game, allowing them to combine for 24 points from beyond the arc. If Harvard coach Tommy Amaker is forced to go to a small lineup, the Lobos’ best player could once again find himself fighting through screens to defend the sharpshooting Rivard.
Perhaps the most interesting matchup of this game will be in the backcourt, with Ivy Player of the Year junior wing Wesley Saunders facing former Mountain West Player of the Year Kendall Williams. Both teams rely heavily on the offensive production of the two guards, so whichever has the better game would likely see his team advance to the third round.
In sum, New Mexico’s big men, who are far better than any that the Crimson has faced this season, would cause major problems for Harvard’s frontcourt. To eek out a win against the Lobos, the Crimson will likely need lights-out performances from Rivard, Saunders, and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers. New Mexico would be the favorite in this one—but hey, we all saw what happened last year.

But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset.Here, we take a look at Kentucky from the SEC.
Record: 24-9, 12-6 SEC
Best Wins: #6 Louisville, Tennessee, Missouri
Worst Losses: Arkansas, LSU, South Carolina
RPI: 15
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 19
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 6
Star Players: Julius Randle (Fr. Forward) 15.4 ppg 10.6 rpg, Willie Cauley-Stein (So. Center) 7.4 ppg 6.3 rpg 2.9 bpg, Andrew Harrison (Fr. Point Guard) 10.8 ppg 3.7 apg
If Harvard draws Kentucky in tomorrow’s Selection Sunday Show, they will already be leading Wildcats in one category: age. Kentucky’s average age is 18.75 years, as the team is stacked with nine freshmen. This isn’t a new phenomenon in Lexington, however, as Wildcats coach John Calipari is notorious throughout college basketball for providing a one-year trampoline to the NBA for the country’s top incoming freshmen.
This year, the Wildcats starting lineup has often featured four freshmen and a sophomore. In September, Calipari ushered in a class that featured six McDonald’s All-Americans, all of whom were ranked in the top 15. Meanwhile, the Crimson was celebrating over the addition of the No. 72 recruit, Zena Edosomwan.
This highly-touted recruiting class drew comparisons to Michigan’s Fab Five, with newcomers James Young and Julius Randle were projected as potential number one draft picks this June. Andrew Harrison was seen as having the potential to be the best point guard in the country, while his twin Aaron was hyped as the best scoring guard and a marksman that could shoot the lights out of the gym. For Harvard fans, Andrew is comparable to sophomore Siyani Chambers, only five inches taller. And Aaron is similar to junior Wesley Saunders, but can also shoot from distances that would leave senior shooting guard Laurent Rivard wide-eyed.
But hype is only hype. While Randle was named SEC Freshman of the Year, the rest of his class has certainly not lived up to the lofty expectations. While the Wildcats have played better as of late, with their backs against the wall, the team has looked abysmal at times. In fact, the brightest spot on the team has arguably been Willie Cauley-Stein, who towers at 7’0’’ and can change games on both ends of the floor.
Kentucky has dropped games to Arkansas (twice), LSU, and South Carolina, all of whom were unranked. The Wildcats, whom many thought could go 40-0, dropped nine contests and left many Lexington faithful questioning the $5.2 million dollars a year that were being spent on Calipari.
Nonetheless, Kentucky still has one last chance to prove itself. The Wildcats are coming off back-to-back wins and will face No. 1 Florida in the SEC Championship Game. If Kentucky’s freshman can pull off the upset, the momentum it has gained from the conference tournament might be enough to spur a run into late March.
If Harvard hopes to upset Kentucky, it will have to learn from the Wildcats early season miscues. The knock on Kentucky is twofold. First, it can forget to defend. Cauley-Stein was named to the All-SEC defensive team, but that doesn’t give the whole picture. The Harrison twins are often caught asleep and disengaged on their defensive end. Saunders has the innate ability to score at will, and with Chambers pushing the pace, the Crimson could cause some trouble. Chambers plays with a speed that is surprisingly unrivaled in the SEC, and that could catch the Wildcats off-guard. In addition, Harvard is known for its high-octane offense, with co-captains Brandyn Curry and Rivard firing three pointers. Meanwhile, Kentucky is 0-4 when giving up 80 or more points, a mark that Harvard has reached an astounding 10 times this season.
Then, there is the age factor. Harvard’s experience could be the key advantage if this matchup comes to fruition. While Kentucky won the National Championship two years ago, only four of its players were on that team (none of them saw any action in the tournament). The rest of the lineup has never even played in a tournament game, as this will be their first trip to March Madness. Besides its freshmen, Harvard’s entire roster has been dancing in March and many recall its bracket-busting performance against University of New Mexico only a year ago. In a first-round matchup, the youth of Kentucky on such a big stage could cause the squad to get flustered, panicking in its first-ever postseason contest.
Don’t be shocked if Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s squad calmly marches into the gym, controlling the pace of play, and using its experience to dictate the outcome of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year it was the Lobos. This year it will be the Bearcats.
On the NCAA Tournament Selection show on Sunday, it was revealed that the Harvard men’s basketball team will face Cincinnati on Thursday morning in Spokane, Wash. 
While the Crimson has known since March 7 that it would take part in its third consecutive Tournament appearance after winning the Ivy League regular season title, who, when, and where it would compete was left up in the air.
“We are incredibly pleased and incredibly proud to be selected,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[E]veryone in college basketball aspires to be in this position at this time of the year. We recognize how fortunate and lucky we are, and I know that these guys want to do an amazing job as they always have done on behalf of our program and our great school.”
The Crimson (26-4, 13-1 Ivy) is seeded at the No. 12 slot in the East Region of the bracket, while the Bearcats (27-6, 15-3 American) sit at No. 5. 
The dancing partners have shared one opponent in common this season—the University of Connecticut. While Harvard lost to the Huskies, 61-56, in January, Cincinnati faced off against Connecticut three times, winning the first matchup by five, and losing the subsequent contests by six and two, respectively. The third of those matchups was in the American Athletic Conference tournament semifinals.
 “I’ve seen [Cincinnati play] here and there with games that have been on throughout the season,” Amaker said. “[From] what I have seen, certainly they’ve been terrific all year…. [The team seemed] incredibly athletic…[and] has played like they’ve always been on a mission and [like they] have an edge about them.”
The Bearcats are led by senior forward Justin Jackson and classmate guard Sean Kilpatrick. Jackson averaged 11.1 points and notched 95 blocks on the year en route to his American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year recognition. Kilpatrick, meanwhile, spearheaded his squad on the offensive end, averaging 20.7 points per contest.
Last season, the Crimson streaked onto the national stage when it upset the University of New Mexico in the second round of the Tournament. With a spotlight on the squad, there is less of a chance that Harvard can sneak by a team—and through the tournament—by staying under the radar.
“I don’t think we’re going to surprise anybody anymore,” said junior wing Wesley Saunders, Ivy League Player of the Year. “I think we just have to go out and expect everybody’s best shot, and give our best shot.”
“This is what we want,” senior forward Kyle Casey added. “We don’t want people to look past us, we want people’s best shots. So we prepare for big games, for battles, and we’re going to go out there with the confidence that we can win…. [I don’t think] anybody will be looking past Harvard, and we definitely won’t be looking past anyone else.” 
For Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry, this year’s outing marks an opportunity to capture an experience that they missed out on last year, as each player took a leave of absence during the 2012-2013 season.
“You just cherish moments more,” said Casey, when asked about the difference in his mentality since returning to the team. “Being away from it, it was definitely a humbling experiencing. Coming back, you really try to take advantage of every day.… As much as I was happy for these guys last year, it’s definitely better to be part of it this year.”
The squad will likely fly out to Spokane by Monday night, and will hit the hardwood on Thursday. While the Crimson has had over a week to rest and re-energize after clinching its Tournament bid, Cincinnati reached March Madness thanks to an at-large bid, and played its last contest this past Friday in the AAC Tournament.
Despite the fact that this is the third straight year that Harvard dances in March, Amaker stressed that the sense of pride that comes with the berth is as strong as ever. 
“[Our players] have worked very hard,” Amaker said. “Guys all year have sacrificed, looking towards opportunities like this. I think they’ve been amazing at staying in the moment and taking advantage of the opportunities right in front of us. I think this is something else where we’ll feel good about [ourselves] as long as we stay true to our identity, our standards. [If we do that], then we can feel good about whatever the scoreboard says.”

Janelle Monáe is headlining this year’s Yardfest! Here’s why we should be excited about this R&B singer coming to campus:
1)   Monáe is a true performer. I am convinced of this after seeing her at Coachella last year. From the costumes, to the choreography, to the stunning live singing voice; her whole show is impressive.
2)   While we might not all be familiar with her solo work, it’s difficult to imagine that there’s a student out there who hasn’t heard the chart-topping, Grammy Award winning song of the year “We Are Young” by Fun., featuring Monáe. Maybe she’ll bring Fun. along with her?
3)   Being a female superstar, Monáe provides a big contrast with Tyga last year, who was heavily criticized and protested by the student body for his violent and misogynistic lyrics. Here’s to activism making a change. Keep on making those change.org petitions!
4) Unlike so many of today’s pop stars who blend together, Monáe has a truly distinct personal style and aesthetic. She generally sports black and white, minimalist suits, and her classic pompadour style hair.
5)   Check out her studio albums The ArchAndroid and The Electric Lady. If you listen to those vocals and still aren’t excited I don’t know what to say…
So, remain on the look out for date and ticket information! Yardfest has come a long way, from Third Eye Blind in 2007 to Kid Cudi in 2010 to Das Racist in 2012 to Monáe in 2014. This year, not only will the event promise a prime day-drinking opportunity and venue to groove nonchalantly to the beat with your classmates, we can expect a great musical performance by a talented musician. Let’s all welcome Monáe to Harvard by showing up to the event and let her know which after-party or Square restaurant to visit afterwards.
Bonus points if anyone is able to convince Monáe to hang around and come out with them after.
