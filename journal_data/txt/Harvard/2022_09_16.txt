After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What does he want from me? What should I try to be? So many faces all around, and here we go. I need this job; oh God, I need this show!” The 1975 Broadway Musical “A Chorus Line” is only slightly hyperbolic in describing the intensity of auditioning. Unlike the Broadway hopefuls in “A Chorus Line,” Harvard students don’t have overdue rent or health insurance to worry about — but with 349 audition sign-ups for eight student-run productions through the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “common casting,” the stakes can feel just as high.
Competing against dozens of your peers for a select number of roles is not the only stressful part of common casting. Drama is an inherently intimate art form. Expressing any kind of emotion in front of another person requires vulnerability and trust. In live performance, the only intermediary between artist and viewing public is the cryptically abstract “fourth wall” separating reality from the story being told onstage. Within such close proximity, to conjure emotion and project it out to a room of strangers is essentially an exercise in blind faith. At an audition, there is no fourth wall to hide behind, no pretense of character, no collective investment of an ensemble or creative team. The other people in the room — present solely to judge you — may be a willing audience, but their interests lie with what they deem best for their show.
The idea that performers are cast based solely on talent or merit is an unfortunately common fallacy. There is no standardized metric on which art — and especially acting — can be judged. Casting boils down to how an actor fits into a small handful of people’s specific vision for a specific role. This element of subjectivity renders casting directors susceptible to indulging implicit and explicit biases, being unable or unwilling to see beyond their preconceived notion of how a character should look, sound, move. In American theater, this historically meant anyone who wasn’t white, thin, and able-bodied was overlooked — or cast as a villain, sidekick, or comic relief. While the audition process can bring out insecurities surrounding both identity and artistic value, it can also be empowering for some.
The climax of anticipation peaked at 6:00 p.m. sharp, on Tuesday, Sept. 6th, when casting decisions for HRDC’s Fall 2022 were published. Over the next 48 hours, lists were re-shuffled as students accepted or denied roles. Every season, some students face the privileged and difficult decision of choosing between shows with conflicting schedules; others might be disappointed or relieved by their names’ absence from the cast lists. Once cast, an actor must submit the “accept this role” form to confirm their spot as a member of the show. If a student refuses a role, their first alternate is alerted that the part is now theirs to take if they so choose. Consequently, a bottleneck of indecision forms as actors stall to see what shows their friends pick, or if the actor cast in a role for which they’re listed as an alternate decides to drop. As the signing deadline looms, the waiting game assumes a sense of urgency. Friends are consulted, directors are emailed, my.hrdctheater.org is refreshed dozens of times as actors check to see if a role for which they are listed alternate has opened up. Everyone holds their breath.
Two days and 59 seconds later, on Thursday, Sept. 8th at 6:01p.m. the signing portal closed. Now, production teams begin composing emails to their finalized ensembles, stage managers start the daunting task of scheduling rehearsals around the hectic time conflicts of up to two dozen Harvard students, actors call their friends to congratulate them and stalk their fellow cast members on Instagram, and everyone lets out a collective breath.
Though no system can fully eliminate the insecurity or anxiety inherent to the competitive nature of auditions, the dependable and unambiguous structure of HRDC’s common casting process creates a space where students can focus solely on presenting their best selves. Frontloading auditions for an entire season’s worth of shows may have its logistical drawbacks, but ultimately this simultinaity provides a sense of camaraderie amongst students from all corners of Harvard’s performing arts scene, gives actors equal exposure to all shows and vice versa, and creates momentum and excitement for the season to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In January 2022, I took my first BeReal in the car, hiding half my face to avoid looking bad in the flipped camera. BeReal’s popularity as a social media app skyrocketed in early 2022 after its release in 2020 by French entrepreneur Alexis Barreyat, appealing to young audiences as an unfiltered, “real” social media. The app sends you a randomly timed notification each day, and you have two minutes to post a BeReal — a spontaneous photo of yourself and of your surroundings.
After discovering it, I fervently convinced all my friends to download the app, set BeReal’s notifications as the only ones allowed through my “Do Not Disturb,” and didn’t miss a single day in February, March, or April. BeReal encapsulated everything I loved about connecting with friends online without carrying everything I hated about digital spaces.
Early on, my BeReal feed was a community of 10 to 15 friends who mutually and indiscriminately reacted and commented on posts, resembling a group chat with extra features more than a full-fledged social media. It was the one safe haven app I opened daily to smile at interactions with real people, not impersonal curated images. Contrary to criticism BeReal received about not being real, I believed in the core mission of people sharing anything, even and especially life’s mundane moments.
Fast forward to today: The tide of my feed has shifted. Friends have started noting that "BeReal has the worst timing” when the notification catches an uninteresting part of the day. I’ve found myself noticing what types of content garners more reactions, driven by the slot machine effect of my occasional “well-received” posts.
It’s starting to be a chore to scroll through the 100+ BeReal friends I've accumulated.
All the characteristics of Real Social Media are seeping in: toxic comparison, filtering oneself, viewing people as numbers. BeReal is slowly losing its joy. What happened? Diving into BeReal’s evolution gives insight into what makes social media toxic and how we might build new versions of “social media” that avoid its worst mental traps.
For me, the first shift comes with the first taste of “success,” or a post that’s noticeably better in some metric: number of reactions, a positive comment, a funny moment captured. Neurotypical human minds register social interactions as a positive reward. More engagement = good. As anyone who’s ever used social media can testify, each post then becomes a gamble of “how many likes/comments/reactions will this get?”. Even when users aren’t consciously evaluating themselves, humans can’t help but chase the intermittent variable rewards — an idea coined by psychologist B. F. Skinner — that social media engagement offers.
On top of self-comparison, a daily flood of posts triggers social comparison, activating the same instincts that help us conform to societal rules. Humans crave acceptance into groups, so they follow implicit rules. When users view others’ exciting BeReals, they wonder why they’re always alone or doing something boring when the notification goes off. They might imitate friends’ facial expressions and camera angles. As each person tries harder to fit the mold, content becomes increasingly shaped to fit the digital subculture of an ever-growing circle of connections.
BeReal itself builds in allowances that enable self-filtering and social comparison. Features like posting a Late, a BeReal posted any time after the notification, or using the front camera offer the guise of control and inclusivity, but these features often undermine the app’s original intention. I can’t explain the joy of seeing my friends working on homework or laying in bed doing nothing. It’s not flashy content, but it resonates, and it sends the message that it’s OK to be alone, to be working, to not be out all the time. The app’s design choices should actively discourage late BeReals that only capture exciting or “BeReal worthy” moments out with friends.
Finally, there are simply too many people in the app. Humans aren’t made to keep track of so many people at once, and the sheer number turns personal interaction into sifting through content. When you can list off every person in your friends list, there’s a feeling of interacting with a real person: you’ll both post, you’ll react, they’ll comment, and there’s a back and forth you can't replicate with 100 people. But when the app isn’t designed to limit the content on your feed, there’s nothing stopping users from creating an infinite scroll past their own limits.
I haven’t stopped using BeReal, yet. I have strongly considered deleting half of my BeReal “friends” to rediscover my small joy, although I’m not convinced it’ll resolve my qualms. I still take my BeReals daily, begrudgingly making a point to do it even if I’m alone in my dorm. Something about BeReal is not quite fun anymore — perhaps the loss of genuine connection with friends, or the strangeness when a group simultaneously pulls out their phones to “be real.” In any case, I’m holding out for a change for the better, or at least, holding out for December, when I can collect and post my year of unfiltered, real moments for the world to see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our new, in-person term has not escaped the now familiar pitfalls of online quarrels. Last week, an event for the rather controversial Harvard College Faith and Action was publicized on Lowell House’s unmoderated email list. Several indignant students quickly responded, criticizing the organization — which describes itself as “a gospel-centered community that welcomes students from all backgrounds” — for an alleged history of discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.
The students are not exactly wrong on the facts. In 2017, HCFA leadership urged the resignation of a female bisexual student-leader from her role as Assistant Bible Course Leader after learning that she was in a same-sex relationship. A year later, Harvard placed the organization on a year-long administrative probation. Following the decision, our board opined that the student’s removal from leadership constituted a morally egregious act, affirming the sanctions levied by the College. However, we also felt that the College’s probation measures — which still allowed HCFA to hold regular meetings — were completely insufficient.
In last week’s email thread, a current leader in Harvard’s Undergraduate Association and HCFA leader defended the organization, stating that “all are welcome at HCFA Doxa, Bible Course, and all other Events, regardless of their sexual orientation, race, or religious identity.” Sharp (and fairly justified) questioning of the HCFA’s ability to stay true to those promises ensued. Given its recent history and current concerns posed by students on campus, HCFA should explicitly re-affirm its commitment to fostering an inclusive campus as a student organization — and make public any evidence of the reform or progress that followed their 2017 debacle.
The current controversy also raises a question about the ofttimes ambiguous role of HUA members. HUA leaders are not meant to be — and should emphatically not be treated as — sources of moral guidance. That strays much too far from their role description. For us, the job of a HUA representative is singular and simple: fund our student clubs and organizations in a timely and efficient fashion. Harvard outsiders and over-eager media outlets might assume otherwise, might attempt to paint them as chosen ideologues or imagined messiahs that define our campus' moral outlook. Yet, as actual Harvard students, we know that is hardly the case: None of our peers are looking at the HUA for ethical guidance.
Of course, as individuals, HUA leaders preserve the right to express their beliefs and state their opinions at their own discretion. They should do so, however, while remaining cognizant of their positionality as student body leaders, of the exaggerated impact and scrutiny linked to their words. In our board's view, as our elected representatives, the extent to which HUA members are relevant in the present discussion comes down to club funding — and we strongly do not believe that the HUA should fund clubs that discriminate against LGBTQ+ people or any identity groups.
Discrimination, in our opinion, includes the denial of one’s identity and entitled expectations that one could and should hide some parts of their identity for the convenience of others. Some people and organizations on this campus may attempt to separate individuals from their queerness — to condemn non-heterosexual relationships but somehow support the individuals themselves. We vehemently disagree. Any attempt to separate people from their LGBTQ+ identities in order to attack the latter is a disingenuous attempt at inclusive self-delusion at best, and a lackluster disguise for homophobia at worst. One cannot accept someone in spite of their core identity; either we accept people in their fullness, or we don’t. We cannot and should not negotiate others’ identities — religious, sexual, racial, or other — for our own comfort.
The queer community, at Harvard and everywhere else, should not have to alienate themselves from their queerness in order to feel comfortable and included within organizations and spaces. Queer students at Harvard, being members of our community, deserve the same transformational experiences and intellectual enrichment they enrolled for. However, individual acts of discrimination that begin with expectations of how queer students ought to behave foster a toxic campus culture that dampens said extraordinary experiences. Our bottom line is simple: this Editorial Board strongly condemns the actions of any organization that discriminates against the LGBTQ+ community in this way or in any other way. This campus should be one of acceptance and inclusion, and we urge every student and organization to reaffirm this through their actions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Haiti lies on the Latin American island of Hispaniola with its neighbor, the Dominican Republic. Naturally, when two countries border each other, migration occurs.
Though there is an assumption that Haitian immigration to the Dominican Republic is a new development resulting from the country’s recent economic issues, it is not. Immigration in large numbers from Haiti to the Dominican Republic began in the 1930s, when many Haitians were transported to sugar cane plantations in the Dominican Republic to work low-wage jobs to boost the economy. The type of back-breaking work Haitian migrants did was often undesirable to Dominicans, as the sugar cane industry was slow and difficult. This influx of Haitian migrants led to several generations of Haitians being born on Dominican land before separation at the border started after the inhumane Parsley Massacre of 1937 — a genocide led by dictator Rafael Trujillo that claimed the lives of up to 20,000 Haitians — and for decades afterward.
According to the 1929 Dominican Republic Constitution, people born in the Dominican Republic were automatically citizens, except those with parents considered “in transit,” such as diplomats and passing travelers. For decades, this definition of citizenship did include those with Haitian ancestry born in the Dominican Republic. However, in 2013, the Dominican Constitutional Court retroactively defined 20th-century Haitian immigrant workers as being “in transit,” therefore invalidating the citizenship of approximately 252,000 of their Haitian Dominican descendants.
The term “in transit” cannot describe a dense group of people who established roots in a country over 70 years ago. It is unacceptable. The idea that Haitian workers would provide the labor to boost other economies for years, then pack up and “return” to a country they are culturally, economically, and socially removed from is ridiculous.
Haitian workers should not expect to have their labor exploited and then be cast away after the hard work is over. These Haitian Dominicans were forced into statelessness by the Dominican government and faced deportation from the only home they had ever known. They were born in the Dominican Republic. They worked in the Dominican Republic. They paid taxes in the Dominican Republic. They got married and had children and grandchildren in the Dominican Republic. They are Dominican.
And they are Hispanic.
All Haitians are Latino by definition because the term Latino “refers to those who are from or have a background in a Latin American country.” Haitian Dominicans are also Hispanic because the term Hispanic “refers to individuals who are Spanish-speaking or have a background in a Spanish-speaking country.” Being first-generation, second-generation, or even third-generation Haitian Dominican counts as having a background in a Spanish-speaking country. Many of them only communicate in Spanish and have no knowledge of Haitian Creole. Their lives were conducted in Spanish from birth.
Haitian ancestry cannot disqualify these Dominicans from their Hispanic identity. It cannot eradicate their native tongue, Spanish, from their mouths. Likewise, it cannot remove decades of Hispanic culture and influence that many of them have experienced from the womb. Hispanic Heritage Month is for Haitian Dominicans. They cannot be forgotten when we celebrate Hispanic peoples. They are a part of the Hispanic diaspora, just like any other Dominican.
How ludicrous would it be if I, a first-generation Haitian American, or any descendant of immigrants within the last centennial were told we are not American? It is our country of birth and where we call home. It would be completely insane to deny my claim to be American because my ancestors were not born here. It is no different for generational Haitian Dominicans.
Where you are born and grow up heavily impacts who you are, what you believe, what you value, and more — in essence, your culture and nationality. To say that Haitian Dominicans have no right to claim their nationality is equivalent to stripping them of the right to claim their culture.
The erasure of Black Hispanics in Hispanic culture is a trend that is far too common and should not persist. It is incredibly harmful to someone’s sense of self if their identity is invalidated for any reason, including having a darker skin color. Colonization has forced us to believe that the more African ancestry one has, the more disposable they are. But Haitian Dominicans are not disposable. They are not erasable. They are not exiles in their country of origin. They are Dominican. And they are Hispanic.

Marc Lipsitch received an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Yale and a DPhil in zoology from Oxford. He is a professor of epidemiology at the Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. He also serves as the director of science at the Center of Disease Control’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics.
This interview has been edited for clarity.
FM: How and when did you decide to become an epidemiologist?
ML: It was a gradual process. I went to graduate school thinking I would do some kind of quantitative biology and got very interested in the evolutionary biology of pathogens because I had an interesting group of people studying math to work with. Over time, I got frustrated with the inability to test the quantitative models that we were making of how pathogens would evolve. They could sort of predict anything, and you couldn’t constrain them very well with data. I started looking for ways to use an approach where you knew whether you were right or not. I got interested in evolution of bacteria and antibiotic resistance, and then — on a lark — applied for jobs in epidemiology departments.
FM: A lot of your work lately has been focused on Covid. Do you remember when you first learned about Covid, or when you first realized how serious it was?
ML: I was at a meeting in Washington, and there were a number of coronavirus experts at that meeting. It was January 22 or 23 of 2020, and they were certainly all talking about it. It had been in the back of my head. Then, as the information from Wuhan began to come out that [Covid infections were] filling up their intensive care units, and it was not just a small outbreak but a much larger thing, I began to pay more attention. By mid-February, I was saying publicly that this was going to be a large event.
FM: What was it like for your work to suddenly be in the spotlight of public attention and government decision-making?
ML: The president had chosen not to make a serious response to this pandemic as it was developing. So I, along with other faculty members and researchers at CCDD, made a conscious decision that one of our roles was going to be to get good information out publicly in the absence of a high functioning government response. So the attention was very welcome. I co-wrote an article in a Scientific American blog about how journalists should cover an event like this and how to distinguish fact from opinion from speculation. It then became very intense: there was one day when I got calls or emails from five different CNN programs asking if I would come on. That’s not something I’ve ever experienced.
FM: You’re the director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics — what does it mean for a disease to be dynamical?
ML: When a disease is communicable, meaning it moves from person to person, that means that it can grow very rapidly. It can be exponential growth. Diseases that are communicable can go from being a non-problem to being a global problem in a very short time. One of the features of our field as opposed to chronic disease epidemiology is that in chronic diseases, you can study problems and figure them out at a normal scientific pace. With communicable diseases, the problem of decision-making under uncertainty is almost always present. At the beginning, you don’t know what the trajectory is going to be, so you plan for a range of scenarios. My new CDC role is to try to help decision-makers understand which range of scenarios is most important to plan for.
FM: What’s a common misconception about Covid or viruses in general that you wish you could dispel?
ML: One of the common misconceptions that’s been problematic is the idea that viruses can either go away or become milder and have a natural tendency to do so. I was asked by the leader of a country who called me up one day — that was another thing that doesn’t happen to me normally — and he said, “I’ve been told that it’s like a toner cartridge, that it runs out of ink eventually.” I said, “Well, there’s no analogy there. Viruses are not toner cartridges. DNA replicates and RNA replicates. It’s just different.”
FM: A lot of your previous research focused on antibiotic resistance. Can you tell me a little bit more why you found this area compelling?
ML: I found it compelling because it’s one of the clear applications of evolutionary thinking to public health. It was a way to constrain my models. But it also is a major global health problem, one where the efforts to control it have been haphazard. Everyone understands that the less you use antibiotics, the better — until the point where you start harming patients. But beyond that, there’s a lack of clarity about what kinds of use matter for what outcomes and how to control the problem.
One of the most recent things we did right before the pandemic was to try to quantify for different bacteria how much of their exposure to antibiotics is due to treatment of them and how much is due to treatment of something else. In almost all species that we studied, the large majority was due to treatment of something else or treatment of nothing, like virus or a cold or asthma.
FM: Your undergraduate degree is in philosophy. How does your academic background influence how you approach epidemiology and your work now?
ML: In the early days, I thought that mathematical modeling was a little like philosophy. It was a lot of abstract thought with reference to the world but was not exactly scientifically testable. More and more, I’ve been moving into areas where testing those models is an essential part, so I don’t think that anymore. But the ability to think abstractly and then bring that to particular cases is something that I learned in that study. In recent years, I’ve developed a strong interest in research ethics.
FM: You mentioned earlier the importance of making information that you’re working on available to the public. A White House policy declared in August that by 2026, all federally funded research will need to be freely available. What are your thoughts on this policy, and how will ending paywalls to scientific journals impact epidemiology?
ML: I’ve been arguing for open-access and favoring open-access journals for my own work — not exclusively, but a lot. I’ve been working as an editor and reviewer on open-access journals. That’s the wave of the future. It’s outrageous that publicly funded research is paywalled. Most journals add almost no value to the papers they publish. “Epidemiology,” one of the major journals in our field, really edits it carefully and improves the paper beyond the peer review. But there are other ways to pay for that. It’s long overdue.
FM: Public health messaging has been a huge point of issue in dealing with Covid, but also many other problems like vaccination and monkeypox. How can we change the way we discuss public health issues to reduce political polarization?
ML: Being very clear about the scientific rationale for advice, what are the limitations of what we know, and what public health authorities are doing to understand the things they need to know to make better advice — all these go a long way. One of the initiatives that our group at the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics has undertaken is to publish what we’re calling technical reports, following the practice from the UK. The report is the latest understanding of an evolving situation. It’s published on a fairly rapid time schedule, it highlights areas of uncertainty, and it provides a lot of data in a downloadable form for other people to use. It’s still a work in progress, but I think that spirit is a really good one. It won’t solve polarization for sure, but it will allow people to have those reasoned discussions with a common set of facts.
FM: What would you say was the biggest public health success of the 20th century?
ML: Vaccination. For sure.
FM: Are there areas of research we should be paying attention to that may bring the biggest public health success of the 21st century?
ML: Because vaccination has been so successful, the remaining major infectious problems are ones for which we don’t have good vaccines — HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria being prominent. In a way, we’ve grabbed the low-hanging fruit of vaccination. And now as technology is evolving, we’re beginning to grip the middle-hanging fruit. The other thing that’s very clear is the inequities at every level, from within a city to within the world, in who has access to health care. Within the U.S., that’s part of a much larger problem of inequities. We all pay our taxes to get the research and, to some extent, to get health care. But what’s available is very unevenly distributed.
FM: Who is one role model that you have?
ML: Perhaps the best answer would be my PhD advisor, Robert May, who died a few years ago. He was an Australian physicist. He always said exactly what he thought and tried to get things done rather than promote himself. I admired his frankness and his ability to back it up with knowing what he was talking about. He was a little brusque — I try not to do that part.
FM: Your academic background and your professional interests are very interdisciplinary: philosophy and biology, and now you’ve incorporated math. Why is such a multifaceted approach successful?
ML: My experience the last couple of years over the pandemic has really convinced me that that not only do I find it personally fun to move back and forth between approaches, but I think it’s really important for public health professionals in the coming years to be comfortable with that, because you get more out of it that way.
FM: In your Twitter profile, you label yourself as an aspiring barista. Tell me more about this dream and how you’ve been making progress towards it. 
ML: I really like making coffee. I really like drinking coffee. I can only tolerate about one or two doubles per day. But I really like it. I wish I could do latte art consistently. I can do it sort of sometimes. At one point, as a birthday present, my mother-in-law offered to give me a barista lesson.
FM: Are you #TeamPfizer or #TeamModerna?
ML: Team whatever I can get. I don’t even remember what I got most recently, a couple of days ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 16, 2022, at 5:17 a.m.
Harvard University agreed on Thursday to return the human remains of 19 individuals who were likely enslaved to their descendants, accepting more than a dozen recommendations from a committee tasked with examining how the school should treat the human remains in its museum collections.
The pledge comes three months after a leaked draft of the committee’s report revealed that Harvard holds the human remains of thousands of Native Americans and 19 individuals who were likely enslaved. The committee’s final report, released Thursday by the University, is largely the same as the draft from April.
Harvard agreed Thursday to accelerate its return of Native American human remains, which has been required by federal law since 1990. It also pledged to build new spaces on campus to house human remains and memorialize the individuals kept in its collections.
The remains studied by the committee were obtained by Harvard “under the violent and inhumane regimes of slavery and colonialism” and represent “the University’s engagement and complicity in these categorically immoral systems,” the final report reads.
“Moreover, we know that skeletal remains were utilized to demonstrate spurious and racist differences to confirm existing social hierarchies and structures,” the report states.
The report’s first recommendation called on Harvard to facilitate repatriation by working to identify direct descendants or descendant communities of the likely enslaved individuals whose remains are in the school’s collections.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow formed two new committees Thursday that will be tasked with carrying out the recommendations — a Human Remains Returns Committee and a Human Remains Research Review Committee.
“It is never too late to afford others the dignity and respect they were denied in life, and it is never too soon to begin the process of recognition and, with hope, reconciliation,” Bacow wrote in an email announcing the report on Thursday.
The Human Remains Returns Committee will be tasked with determining how the University should handle remains of individuals who were not enslaved or who fall outside the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, which requires that Native American remains be returned to their descendants or tribes. The Human Remains Research Review Committee will “work with Museum staff on assessing requests” by Harvard or other scholars to use skeletal remains.
Harvard also agreed to reconfigure its stewardship of human remains by creating a “purpose-designed” viewing space, facilitating a review of existing academic practices and curricula on human remains, and memorializing individuals held in its collections.
In the report’s afterword, the chair of the committee that conducted the review, Evelynn M. Hammonds, wrote about her first visit to the storeroom in the Peabody Museum, which houses the human remains.
“My visit confirmed for me in a deep and profound way that a museum is not and should never be a place for the remains of humans,” she wrote. “In fact, how people are kept in a museum may be antithetical to practices of caring for the dead of the communities whose ‘remains’ are ‘stored’ in museums.”
Thursday’s report was interspersed with reflections from faculty on Harvard’s ties to slavery.
“For centuries, the remains of ‘others’ have been collected in the name of scientific progress—science of the sort that accepted their bodies as simple data, objects to be measured,” Harvard postdoctoral fellow Aja M. Lans wrote in one essay.
The report urged faculty across the University to craft curricula that engage the histories of human remains collections on campus, with a focus on the “ethical dimensions of their presence” and “how they reflect the complex history of the University.”
Thursday’s report comes eight months after Bacow commissioned the Steering Committee on Human Remains in Harvard Museum Collections to develop University-wide policies for collecting, displaying, and returning human remains. Bacow and Jane Pickering, director of the Peabody Museum, formally apologized then for past practices that allowed Harvard to amass a collection of more than 22,000 human remains.
The report is a major step in Harvard’s efforts to redress its history of slavery and discrimination. In April, the University published a landmark report that detailed the “integral” role slavery played in its history and pledged $100 million to a Legacy of Slavery Fund.
There is no mention in the legacy of slavery report or the human remains report issued on Thursday of a high-profile 2019 lawsuit brought by Tamara K. Lanier, who says the school illegally possesses daguerreotypes of two of her enslaved ancestors, Renty and Dalia. Massachusetts’ top court ruled in June that Lanier has grounds to sue the school for emotional distress, but rejected her claim to the photographs.
Hammonds wrote in Thursday’s human remains report that she hopes her committee’s work allows Harvard to begin redressing its ties to slavery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard School of Dental Medicine launched a new dental residency program in New Hampshire this fall focusing on oral health care for rural and underserved populations.
The program is a collaboration between Harvard, the Bi-State Primary Care Association, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, and six other rural care providers in the state.
There are currently no dental schools or residency programs in New Hampshire, which faces a dentist shortage with demand increasing under a new state program that expands adult dental benefits.
Stephanie Pagliuca, the director of workforce development and recruitment at the Bi-State Primary Care Association, said the new Harvard dental residency program has been in the works for more than 15 years and has involved “a lot of stakeholders coming to the table.”
Pagliuca said the pandemic worsened the dentist shortage in rural areas.
“They want to train these residents, but they don’t have enough dental assistants,” she said of New Hampshire dentists. “The oral health needs — and the overall health needs — of the patients in their communities are very high at a time when it’s very difficult to hire people into the health care workforce.”
The new residency program consists of two separate programs: the Advanced Education in General Dentistry and the Dental Public Health programs. Christine Ann Riedy Murphy, an associate professor of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard, said the school wanted to create a program that could provide post-doctoral training in both general dentistry and public health.
“The long-term goal really is … to expand the workforce who would likely practice in community health centers or in rural areas,” she said.
Pagliuca said she is optimistic about the new program.
“I just want to show young dentists who are interested in learning about public health and learning about rural populations that New Hampshire is a great place to do this work,” she said. “I’m just really excited about the fact that residents can find meaningful practice opportunities and enhance their skills, and find a place that they might want to settle for the long term.”
The first cohort of the AEGD program began on Sept. 1.
“Not only are we hoping to train providers to care for their patients in a patient-centered manner, but that the patients then will be getting great care that actually speaks to them and is what they need,” Riedy said.

In 1989, a Boston developer, known as the Beal Companies, began acquiring a stake in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Allston. Eight years and nearly $90 million later, the firm had amassed a total of 52.6 acres of the neighborhood’s land.
It wasn’t until 1997 that the true financier of the land purchases was revealed: Harvard University, Allston’s neighbor across the Charles River.
A University spokesperson at the time called the move “fiscally prudent” in a comment to the New York Times. The Boston Globe called it “a stealthy land grab.”
Brighton resident Justin L. Brown said Harvard’s secret acquisition of land “sowed a lot of distrust between the residents of Allston-Brighton and Harvard.”
Today, Harvard is the largest landholder in Allston, with 360 acres — roughly one-third of the neighborhood.
These land holdings include campus cornerstones — the Harvard Athletics Complex, the Harvard Business School, the $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex — as well as the development of hundreds of residential units at 180 Western Ave. and 176 Lincoln St. The Harvard Ed Portal has garnered significant praise from residents who utilize its educational resources.
Harvard’s future plans also include the proposed Enterprise Research Campus, a 900,000-square-foot mixed-use development including residential, lab, hotel, and restaurant space.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow says the proposed development will be for Allston residents.
“Our vision for an Enterprise Research Campus emerged from deep engagement with the Allston community, the city of Boston, and many more stakeholders over many years, and our work together will be stronger for it,” Bacow said in July. “The ERC will be for everyone.”
But with Harvard’s forays into commercial development, Brown said the University no longer feels like an “institutional neighbor.”
“Now, Harvard is this enormously influential and powerful institution that’s not talking about residence halls or science labs for its students, but talking about hotels and commercial lab space,” Brown said.
University spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote in a statement that Harvard’s long involvement in Allston has been characterized by deep engagement.
“We are proud to be part of this vibrant, exciting neighborhood, and benefit immensely from collaborative work with residents, organizations, businesses, elected officials and others through programs, partnerships, public spaces and other shared activities and priorities,” she wrote.
The University’s 10-year timeline for its 2013 Institutional Master Plan is set to expire next year, raising the question of how Harvard will define the next chapter of its relationship with Allston residents.
The ties between Harvard and Allston date back to the neighborhood’s origins.
For more than 160 years, the land now dubbed Allston and Brighton was once part of Cambridge. Following disputes with the Cambridge city government, in 1807, the town known as “Little Cambridge” opted to secede.
The east side of the land officially became its own entity in the late 1860s and was named Allston in honor of Washington Allston — an 1800 Harvard alum.
Between 1875 and 1925, the population of Allston-Brighton grew by over 40,000 people and became a prestigious and developing neighborhood. Around that time, Harvard made its initial expansions into the town when it established Harvard Stadium in 1903 and the Harvard Business School in 1927.
By the second half of the century, the neighborhood began to experience strains still felt today: resident exodus to outer suburbs, a housing crisis, and traffic congestion.
Harvard’s eight-year anonymous property buyup marked a turning point in the University’s positioning in Allston-Brighton. Then-Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino called the acquisitions the “highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.”
But Harvard’s move to purchase land through Beal Companies wasn’t unheard of. Bruce A. Beal, co-founder of Beal Companies, told the New York Times in 1997 that he worked with the Boston Public Libraries in the 1960s to purchase land for them in a strategy similar to Harvard’s.
Lifelong Allston resident John A. Bruno called the purchase a “somewhat disingenuous” — but a “prudent” business move for Harvard.
Harvard’s future Allston purchases were made in its own name. In 2000, the University bought a 48-acre parcel of land, followed up by another 91-acre purchase in 2003.
The University’s vision for its holdings across the river began to crystallize.
In a 2003 open letter to Harvard affiliates, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers unveiled the first public vision surrounding the Allston purchases: a 21st-century expansion of Harvard’s campus. By that point, Harvard had amassed over 200 acres of Allston land.
“The choices we make in the coming years about this extraordinary opportunity will do much to shape Harvard for decades to come,” Summers wrote in the letter.
The campus could include new science and technology facilities, artistic and cultural centers, and new student housing, Summers said.
But Summers’ vision appeared to enter dire straits under new University President Drew G. Faust. The Boston Globe reported in a December 2007 story, titled “Harvard Rethinks Allston,” that Faust was reconsidering major tenets of Summers’ proposed Allston expansion, including the construction of four new undergraduate dorms and the relocation of the School of Public Health and Graduate School of Education.
Still, Faust maintained the University was moving full steam ahead, disputing the Globe’s portrayal in a phone call to The Crimson.
“It’s not a reversal. It’s not a slowing down,” Faust said. “It’s moving to the next stage of a plan.”
But in the two years that followed, Harvard’s endowment plunged by nearly 30 percent amid the Great Recession. The school was forced to halt its expansion plans for the time being.
A decade before the construction of Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex, a Harvard history professor predicted a high-tech Allston campus empty by nightfall.
“You have no problem, I am sure, imagining a science campus that by 6:30 p.m. is abandoned, at least from the outside,” wrote professor Peter L. Galison ’77 in a 2007 Crimson Op-Ed. “The only sounds are those of wind, windshield wipers, a few quiet conversations by the shuttle bus stop, and the rumble of air conditioning systems.”
Galison wrote the piece, entitled “Allston Dreams,” mere months after Harvard released a 74-page master plan in 2007 for a vision of Allston that would soon become derailed by the Great Recession.
Since Galison’s piece, the long-awaited 544,000-square-foot Science and Engineering Complex has opened its doors in fall 2021 to great acclaim from students and some residents.
“It brings beauty, practicality, and sustainability into harmony, a symbol of the University’s commitment to making the world better as we undertake our best work,” Bacow said in a press release months before the facility opened.
Some Allston residents have commended the building’s aesthetic and surrounding greenspace. Others said the SEC’s grandeur felt exclusionary. Residents also linked the SEC to rising housing costs.
The SEC was a major attraction of the University’s 2013 Institutional Master Plan, which was unanimously approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority in October 2013. The IMP contains nine projects totaling nearly 1.4 million square feet, including the construction of a new executive education facility at the Harvard Business School and additions to the Harvard Stadium. The plan also detailed a mixed-use development at Barry’s Corner.
But prior to the plan’s approval, Allston residents raised an array of concerns. The development at Barry’s Corner would cause congestion, some said. Residents also took issue with a lack of specificity surrounding Harvard’s plans for affordable housing and sustainability.
Harvard has taken a number of initiatives to address resident anxieties.
Since 2000, the University has sponsored the Harvard Local Housing Collaborative, intended to bolster the supply of low-cost housing in Cambridge and Boston. In 2019, the University renewed the collaborative, which has invested more than $40 million in the Greater Boston area, according to its website. Harvard also helped establish Allston-Brighton’s “All Bright Homeownership Program” in 2015, which seeks to improve access to homeownership for the neighborhood's residents as outside investors and developers buy up property in the area.
Further, the SEC has been certified LEED Platinum by the U.S. Green Building Council — a certification measuring the building’s sustainability.
Despite such efforts, Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident, said he believes Galison’s “Allston Dreams” have become a reality.
“If what you were thinking is, hey, we're going to build a new neighborhood, or we're going to build a new Main Street, and we're going to create vitality, and we're going to create Boston's next great new neighborhood, then they've completely failed,” Mattison said.
Harvard’s upcoming projects — particularly the much-anticipated Enterprise Research Campus — continue to be a source of concern for some Allston residents.
Plans for the ERC first debuted in 2011, with the BPDA approving a framework for expansion in 2018. The proposed ERC would include a hotel and conference center, office and laboratory space, and residential, retail, and restaurant developments.
In its pitch to residents, the University touted nearly three acres of publicly accessible open space, centering on a public “greenway” plaza and lawn that will connect Raymond V. Mellone Park — named in honor of a former Harvard Allston Task Force chair — to the Charles River.
Bacow said the “vision for an Enterprise Research Campus emerged from a deep engagement with the Allston community” and that the ERC will, resultantly, “be for everyone”.
Some union representatives from Local 26 — representing Boston hospitality workers — voiced support for the proposal due to its affordable housing stipulations and potential to create jobs. Other residents felt the proposal insufficiently addressed their concerns.
During the approval process for Phase A of the ERC development, continuing resident concerns culminated in the formation of the Coalition for a Just Allston and Brighton last August. The advocacy group aims to demand accountability from Harvard regarding resident outreach, affordable housing plans, and sustainability efforts.
Earlier this year, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 received a pair of letters — one from CJAB and one from former University Vice President Katherine N. Lapp — which characterized the University’s expansion into Allston in starkly different terms.
In its 19-page letter, CJAB members raised concerns about a future in Allston-Brighton defined by unaffordable housing, barriers to small businesses, traffic congestion, and climate change. Lapp’s letter, meanwhile, expressed Harvard’s desire to turn its purchased properties in Allston into “vibrant, equitable and welcoming” spaces.
Kevin M. Carragee, a Brighton resident and member of CJAB, said the University is not upholding its “social justice mission.”
To quell affordability concerns amid Allston’s housing crisis, Harvard entered a landmark agreement with Allston leaders this past July. Under the agreement, brokered by the Wu administration, the University committed to 25 percent residential units to be affordable within Phase A of the ERC. Harvard also agreed to donate $25 million to establish the Allston-Brighton Affordable Housing Fund and to donate a 0.9-acre tract of land at 65-79 Seattle St. to an affordable housing developer.
The University has also made commitments to expand transportation, including a 2018 pledge of $50 million to the neighborhood’s planned West Station MBTA extension — currently set for construction in 2040. The station is part of Allston’s larger I-90 Multimodal Project, for which Harvard has promised hundreds of millions of dollars of support.
Residents and elected officials from the area have also voiced concern over what they deem insufficient communication from the University.
Kamosa, the University spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “committed to ongoing engagement with the community to advance shared goals, and to ensuring our spaces and places are lively, welcoming and inclusive, and that they maintain and enhance the unique creative culture of the neighborhood.”
Still, Brown said opportunities to engage with the University are not accessible to certain residents.
“Attending lots of meetings and understanding how the development and planning processes works creates obstacles for people who don't have the time or the background, and these are members of our community who are often most impacted by development: immigrants, low-income renters, people of color,” Brown wrote in an email.
This coming year, the University could offer a new Institutional Master Plan detailing its current developments in Allston and presenting its next decade-long agenda.
Kamosa wrote that the University wants to contribute to a “thriving, innovative ecosystem” that will change the neighborhood in “profound ways.”
Whether the upcoming IMP will meet the neighborhood’s needs remains to be seen. But Bruno, the Allston resident, is optimistic.
“I see the history, and I see the potential,” Bruno said. “They know everything, whether it’s medicine or engineering or education, financing — they’re the best. Why would we be reluctant to partner with the best?”
Meanwhile, Brown said the future of Harvard-Allston relations relies on the “energized and activated” residents.
“[Harvard] understands that it has an enormous amount of power, and it will use that power,” Brown said. “So what we need to do is build our own power and make sure that we’re taking collective action and speaking with one voice, making demands that Harvard has to listen to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers discussed his concerns about the continued risk of inflation for the global economy at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Thursday evening.
The forum, held as part of the 2022 Globe Summit, was moderated by Linda Pizzuti Henry, the managing director of Boston Globe Media Partners, who owns the Boston Red Sox along with her husband, John W. Henry.
Summers said he believes the United States is headed for a recession but remains in a better economic position than many European countries because it is less reliant on other nations for energy.
“My best guess is we’ll have a recession in the United States,” he said. “But I'm much more confident that there’s going to be a recession and an element of stagflation in Europe that comes as a consequence … of the staggering vulnerability that they created for themselves.”
Summers, a former Harvard president, was vocal in predicting last year that the U.S. could see high inflation. Henry began the forum by asking him about his calculus at the time.
“I saw a GDP gap [in] the United States of perhaps 2 or 3 percent, and I saw that we were doing 14 percent of GDP in fiscal stimulus,” he said. “And I thought to myself, ‘this bathtub is gonna overflow pretty badly.”
He said he expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates amid inflationary pressures.
“I think we need to be firm and resolute with respect to inflation. What that exactly will mean, I don't think is clear down the road,” he said. “I’m sure they're going to have to continue to raise interest rates.”
In the second half of the forum, Summers took questions from audience members, who asked about his career, his economic forecasting, and the global economy.
Asked by Henry at the end of the discussion about Boston’s economic future, Summers highlighted the academic talent it attracts.
“We live in a cognitive era, where intellectual talent and brainpower is more important for economic success than it's ever been before,” he said. “Boston, with all its universities and all its colleges, stands out for how much of that it possesses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost 200 current and former Harvard Law School students signed onto a letter last week calling on the school to redistribute any savings it receives from President Joe Biden’s loan forgiveness program to alumni in low-paying jobs.
The Biden administration unveiled a debt forgiveness plan last month that will cancel loans for millions of American students. In a letter sent to Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 on Sept. 6, HLS students and alumni said the Biden administration’s program could be “a massive windfall for Harvard.”
Since 1978, the Law School has sought to help graduates pursue lower-paying public service jobs through its Low Income Protection Plan. The program subsidizes annual loan repayment obligations based on the income of graduates in low-paying industries.
According to the letter, LIPP may see a decrease in expenditures since it “will no longer need to provide repayment assistance for the $10,000/$20,000 in loans that will be forgiven” or the interest that would have been accrued by those loans.
The letter called on Harvard to “redirect” the potential savings “to the community to which it was originally intended: indebted students and alumni” and “make public how it expects Biden’s forgiveness plan to affect its bottom line.”
The Law School’s Student Financial Services office wrote in a response to the letter’s signatories that the school will consider the letter in its annual planning process, which is “scheduled to kick off in the coming weeks and is expected to conclude in the spring.”
“Every academic year, Harvard Law School engages in a comprehensive and multifaceted planning process for the year ahead, through which data from a multitude of sources is considered,” the Law School’s response said.
“This annual budget process aims to ensure that all available resources are used to advance our school’s mission of teaching, research, and service; to help students thrive in law school; and to provide graduates with the freedom to pursue career options of their choice,” it added.
But the alumni who authored the letter said they felt the school’s response fell short.
“I think it was a very kind of boilerplate, noncommittal response that just kind of highlights how little transparency there is in who makes these decisions,” said Beth S. Feldstein, an HLS alum who co-authored the letter.
LIPP has long faced criticism and calls for reform from HLS alumni and students. In May, the school announced it would increase the contribution scale used to calculate the amount of subsidy offered to participants, marking the highest increase in LIPP’s 45-year history.
But Brendan R. Schneiderman — a 2021 HLS graduate who co-authored the letter and has led previous petitions to reform LIPP — said the program is failing to serve its original mission.
“People are really struggling and have been struggling for a couple of years,” he said. “And it seems like Harvard is just getting away with doing the bare minimum that it can.”
HLS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the Law School annually invests “significant resources” in LIPP and its financial aid program in order to make the school more accessible and allow graduates to pursue the career path of their choice.
“Annual spending on the Low Income Protection Plan has doubled in the past decade and has grown at more than twice the annual rate of the law school’s budget overall,” Neal wrote.

Well folks, it’s almost that time of the year. Freshman flu is coming in hot, with shorter days and colder weather knocking at our door in the weeks to come. Each day that passes is one closer to the official end of summer. A sad thought, right? Yeah, I was bummed too.
But! Then it came to me. Or rather, it came to my Instagram ads. The Harvard Square fall drinks are back and as boujee as ever, and what better way to start off the season than with a piping hot, over-the-top, autumn-themed beverage? Maybe I just need an excuse to fuel my caffeine addiction, or maybe the drinks are simply that good. Here’s a breakdown of Flyby’s favorite fall drinks for you to try this semester.
Pumpkin Spice Latte (Everywhere)
The pinnacle of fall-themed drinks and found in every coffee shop ever, I can only describe it as if a warm, freshly baked pumpkin pie dove into a pool of steaming coffee. Divine. This classic latte will warm you right up and make those cool days actually look appealing (for the ten minutes it takes you to drain your cup). Not to mention, the autumnal aesthetic is strong with this drink, so if the fall vibe is what you’re striving for, then this one will do the trick.
Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew (Starbucks)
If you’re a die-hard iced coffee fan like me, then a nice, refreshing cold brew will always make your day — be it rain, shine, or snow (all plausible for the fall season in Cambridge). Pair that with the spirited taste of pumpkin, and you have the perfect chilly treat to enjoy from the warmth of your dorm as it cools down outside.
Apple Crisp Oatmilk Macchiato (Starbucks)
For all you oatmilk baddies out there, this is a fun one to branch out with. Speaking honesty here, this drink tastes uncannily like Quaker Oats’ Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal, which was wildly odd to discover, but it kind of grew on me? The apple flavor may not be everyone’s cup of coffee, but it’s new and interesting and certainly fall-like. If you’ve been craving the apple picking season with its fritters and pies and such, then this is my recommendation for you!
Pumpkin Cold Brew Oat Latte with Brown Sugar Jelly (Peet’s)
Now that’s a mouthful both to order and to drink. I personally didn’t even try to say it all, just pointed at the picture on the wall and said “that one”— it seemed to do the trick. Found at Peet’s Coffee, this drink is a funky fresh twist on the classic pumpkin drink, though the brown sugar jellies did confuse my taste buds on a number of levels. If extra AF is what you’re searching for, then look no further.
Hot Cider (Everywhere)
Not a coffee person? Never fear, you still have options aplenty. Most local coffee shops will be happy to offer you a lovely non-caffeinated beverage such as hot cider, a personal fav as well as a perfectly respectable alternative to coffee that’ll still get you into the fall spirit.
I hope I’ve managed to convince at least a small portion of you to give some of these funky drinks a whirl this fall — especially once we get into midterm season, when the only way I can feel anything besides stress is to buy my silly little drinks between study sessions (I’m fine, I promise). Flyby wishes you a happy fall!
