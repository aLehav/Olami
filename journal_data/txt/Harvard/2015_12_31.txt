After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite going on a 18-4 run late in the second half to pull within five, the Harvard women’s basketball team ultimately could not make up a 19-point deficit as it fell to Fairfield, 67-50.
Playing on the road at Alumni Hall, the Crimson (4-6) struggled to catch up to the Stags (5-6) after Harvard failed to score during an eight-minute gap between the first and second quarters, allowing 16 points during that span.
Down 15 entering the fourth quarter, the Crimson mounted a comeback led by co-captain AnnMarie Healy and classmate Shilpa Tummala, who scored over half of Harvard’s points, combining for 39 of the Crimson’s 50. After pulling within five off a jumper from Healy, Harvard struggled to score down the stretch, putting up seven to Fairfield’s 19 in the last seven minutes of the contest.
“They had the lead the whole game,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They took the lead early in the first, and we were in the hole, down 15 for most of the game. We had a nice comeback in the fourth, brought it down to five or six, and then we just couldn’t sustain it.”
Despite finishing with more than twice as many offensive rebounds as the Stags, the Crimson failed to capitalize due to poor shooting. Harvard shot a season-low 29.5 percent from the field and 26.9 percent from beyond the arc.
The shooting struggles for the Crimson began early. Through the first two quarters, Healy and Tummala were the only two Harvard players to register a field goal, accounting for 19 of Harvard’s 20 in the first half. The Crimson entered halftime down 13 after a difficult second quarter where Harvard shot 2-of-14 from the field and 1-of-7 from beyond the arc.
“We we’re not very connected offensively. We looked very out of sync, out of sorts,” Delaney-Smith said. “We didn’t execute any of our offenses very well. I don’t know whether that’s because we haven’t played in three weeks or what it was. We didn’t execute our system very well.”
“We are just disappointed that the ball didn't go in,” Healy added.
Beyond the shooting struggles, the Crimson has difficulty scoring in the paint. There, Harvard scored only six points to Fairfield’s 34. Often relegated to taking outside shots, the Crimson took a total of 26 three-pointers to the Stags’ eight, connecting only on seven.
To add to Harvard’s offensive woes, the team struggled at the charity stripe, making only seven of its 14 free throws, while the Stags shot 18-of-22.
On the defensive end, the Crimson struggled to shut down the Stag offense, allowing Fairfield to shoot nearly 50 percent from the field and failing to shut down junior forward Kelsey Carey who went for 27 points on 9-of-16 shooting from the field.
“We were very disjointed,” Delaney-Smith said. “We didn’t come together as a team—definitely not on the offensive end and then we just had big lapses on the defensive end.”
While Harvard matched Fairfield point for point in the third before making its late run, the Crimson failed to capitalize off turnovers late and sent the Stags to the line often, allowing Fairfield to tally 11 points in the fourth quarter at the charity stripe. Fairfield ended the match on a 19-7 run that saw the Harvard miss 10 of its last 13 shots.
Monday’s loss marks the Crimson’s fourth in a row after the squad won three straight earlier in the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s Basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason highlights three things to watch ahead of Harvard’s New Year’s Eve matinee with Wofford (2:30 PM EST). The Crimson (5-7) is coming off a second-place finish in last week’s Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic while the Terriers (3-8) are riding a four-game losing streak dating back to Dec. 6. Thursday will mark the first meeting between the two schools. 
HOME COOKING
Harvard returns to Lavietes Pavilion for a home game for the first time since Nov. 25. The Crimson is 2-1 this season in Cambridge, with wins coming against MIT and Bryant. Thursday’s contest marks the start of a four-game homestand for Harvard. Since the beginning of the 2010-2011 season, the Crimson is 63-6 at Lavietes. The .913 home winning percentage is the eighth-highest in the country over that span. Harvard went 12-2 at home last season and has not had more than two home losses in a season since the 2008-2009 campaign.
Wofford has struggled away from Benjamin Johnson Arena this season, winning just one of its eight road contests. Last year’s Terriers rode a 10-5 road record to a Southern Conference championship and an NCAA Tournament berth.
STARTING STRONG
The Crimson’s success in Hawaii last week was spearheaded by hot starts on the offensive end of the floor. In the first halves of its three games in the Diamond Head Classic, Harvard outscored its opponents, 108-93. The Crimson rode double-digit first half leads to victories over BYU and Auburn. The average of 36 points in the first half was more than five points above the team’s average in its first nine games of the season. In its last six games, Harvard is averaging 73.3 points per game. The Crimson’s starters are averaging nearly 57 points per game in its last three contests while reserve guard Corbin Miller averaged 10.7 points per game in Hawaii.
On the season, Wofford is averaging just 27.9 first half points per game while the Terriers are allowing over 33 points a game.
EMERGING FORCE
The Diamond Head Classic may have been the performance Harvard has been looking for from junior forward Zena Edosomwan since the highly touted Los Angeles native committed to the Crimson in 2012. Edosomwan was named to the All-Tournament team and received Ivy League Player of the Week honors.
The junior averaged 20.3 points and 13 rebounds in Hawaii and is averaging a double-double on the season (14.6 points, 10.8 rebounds). Edosomwan’s presence on the glass will be key for Harvard against Wofford. On the season, the Terriers are being outrebounded by its opponents by 4.4 rebounds per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first game at Lavietes Pavilion since Nov. 25, the Harvard men’s basketball team closed out 2015 with a 77-57 win over Wofford.
After starting December with two losses to Northeastern and Kansas, the Crimson (6-7) has gone 4-1 since Dec. 8, with the 20-point victory over Wofford (3-9) its largest margin of victory since defeating Bryant by 35 on Nov. 17.
Harvard was led by the veteran trio of junior Zena Edosomwan and seniors Evan Cummins and Patrick Steeves. Edosomwan and Cummins both had 15 points on the day while Steeves added 12 of his own. With his 15 points, Cummins set a new career high for the second time in just over a week, after improving the stat to 13 points against Auburn on Dec. 23. Overall, the Harvard offense shot 63.8 percent from the field, a season high.
“We were concerned coming off the long trip and certainly made a lot of strides in Hawaii,” Amaker said. “But coming off the trip and playing a team that’s better than their record, that has a culture of winning, we were certainly concerned and I was pleased to see the great team effort.”
The Crimson got off to a slow start, scoring just five points in the first four minutes. Edosomwan struggled out of the gate, as the Terriers muffled the Crimson’s leading scorer by sending a double-team his way any time the ball was in the junior’s hands.
Nearly 14 minutes went by before the junior made a field goal, but from that point the Terriers had few answers for Edosomwan. After sinking a layup with 6:30 to go in the first half, Edosomwan added six more points to his total in the final four minutes.
When he wasn’t scoring, the junior excelled passing the ball. The Crimson had an assist on 22 of 30 field goals, with Edosomwan leading the way with five.
“Zena is drawing so much more attention now in terms of scouting report and focal point and certainly strategy and coverages in the game while being double teamed,” Amaker said. [Edosomwan and Cummins] are really finding ways to play with each other.”
One of the keys to his success this season, according to Edosomwan, is reading what the defense is giving him. Against the Terriers, his way of responding to the double-team was to share the ball rather than powering through the Wofford frontcourt.
“Sometimes its rhythm, and also, kind of, I just read what the defense is giving me,” Edosomwan said after a loss to UMass. on Nov. 17.  “So just kind of understanding who I’m playing against, understanding what the defense is giving me.”
After going to the locker room up by six, 31-25, Harvard exploded in the second half, scoring 46 points in the game’s final 20 minutes. While the offense shot well in the first half, sinking 56 percent of its field goals, the team shot at a 70 percent clip in the second frame.
The team’s three-point shooting also improved in the second, shooting 6-of-9 from behind the arc in the second frame after going 2-of-5 in the first.
Nine of Steeves’ 12 points came in the second half, while freshman guard Tommy McCarthy added eight of his own after the break. Though Cummins and Edosomwan were the team’s leading scorers, the hot shooting from deep of Steeves and McCarthy stretched the Wofford defense.
With freshman Corey Johnson and junior Corbin Miller commanding the most defensive attention behind the arc, Steeves and McCarthy took advantage—shooting a combined 60 percent from three. Johnson ranks fourth in the Ivy League in three-pointers per game and Steeves ranks second in the Ancient Eight in shooting percentage from deep at a team-high 48 percent.
McCarthy’s trey with 14:05 to go in the contest gave Harvard its first double-digit lead of the contest, with the Crimson up 44-34. Just over two minutes later a Steeves three stretched the lead to 13.
The Terriers would never pull closer than 10 for the rest of the afternoon. The sizable lead for the Crimson gave Amaker a chance to lengthen his bench, with sophomore Andre Chatfield returning to action after battling injury for most of the month. Sophomore Zach Yoshor also made it on to the floor as the clock wound down in the final minutes.

2015 has been a big year at Harvard and in the world: from a Snowpocalypse to the “Summer of Trump” to the wonderful enigma that is Rakesh Khurana, we’ve experienced a lot in the past 365 days. Check out some of Flyby’s biggest moments:

January 1 – PSA: C’est Bon Heroically Open Throughout SnowpocalypseThey always say that hard times reveal true friends. We at Harvard learned this firsthand during our time of greatest need—Snowpocalypse 2015. The days were short, the snow was high, and our stockpile of cheap liquor was running alarmingly low. Who were the true heroes during those dark days but the brave men and women of C’est Bon Market & Liquors, who courageously kept their doors open amidst a blizzard? We at Flyby would like to take this opportunity to once again commend C’est Bon: not the hero we deserved, but the one that we needed.
February 21-March 4 – Datamatch: Flyby’s Shot at Love, Parts 1-5Flyby Staff Writers Hyemi, Nacho, Brooke, Chris, and Eva all bravely asked out one of their top Datamatches for a date in the Square. A series of sometimes hilarious, sometimes depressing anecdotes ensued. While results ranged, we at Flyby are still convinced that Datamatch is our one shot at finding true love. Keep an eye out for this in 2016!

March 26 – PSA: Malia Obama Tours HarvardWhile the narcs over at Brown tried to get Malia grounded by snapchatting pictures of her maybe, possibly, playing beer pong, we at Flyby kept it classy with Betty Anne Richardson’s epic long-distance selfie. While we still haven’t heard where Malia has gotten big envelopes from, we’re sure she won’t make the wrong decision. In the meantime, College students across campus are probably watching the classic “My Date with the President’s Daughter” for tips, you know, just in case.
August 3 – ‘Poonsters Prank The Crimson—and Dupe Donald TrumpWhile we don’t often encourage the antics of a certain semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, we have to give credit where credit is due. The title says it all—some ’Poonsters convinced Donald Trump of a fake Crimson endorsement, and took a photo to prove it. Certainly a highlight of our summer (and do we wish we had thought of it? Maybe.)

October 16 – HUDS Attempts Cheese FriesIt does not end well. Next time just toss it all in the microwave like the rest of us, Betty.
October 16 – Dean Khurana Has a VespaIf you thought the Dean of the College couldn’t get cooler, you were wrong. Catch him cruising down Garden Street from Cabot to the Yard—wearing a helmet, of course. Honestly, this was probably the most news-worthy piece of 2015. We’re still disappointed that The New York Times didn’t pick it up.
November 3 – Sophomores are Declaring Their Concentrations on an Online Tool That Does Not Exist YetSophomore fall is a stressful time, to say the least. You no longer have the security blanket of your freshman proctor or entryway, you’re adjusting to living in a new House where you barely know anyone, and on top of that you’re trying to figure out what interests you enough to study it for three years. To add insult to injury to stressed-out sophomores, in the weeks before the deadline, Harvard didn’t even bother to post the declaration tool, despite sending out emails reminding sophomores that they needed to declare. Thanks for adding to the #slumplife, my.harvard!
 November 9 – Do You Wanna Pset and Chill?It’s more than a request—it’s a movement. Scandalized by the rise in popularity of “Netflix and Chill,” Flyby encouraged students to opt for the GPA-maximizing, drama-minimizing “Pset and Chill” instead. After all, what’s sexier than a 4.0 and a job offer by senior fall?
November 12 – Meet the Scooterers of HarvardEver been trudging your way up Dewolfe on the way to the Yard, when suddenly someone whizzes by you? It’s not a car, nor is it a bicyclist – no, it’s a scooterer. If you thought you outgrew your old Razor once you started middle school, you would be wrong. Scooters are back and better than ever, and these intrepid riders got in on the ground floor.
December 21 – Flyby’s Holiday Placement for Nosy RelativesIn the wake of controversy following the College’s “Social Justice Placemats,” we at Flyby created our own placemat to answer the college-related questions we all get asked after winter break. Whip this one out when you have to deal with a nosy aunt or a drunk uncle.
