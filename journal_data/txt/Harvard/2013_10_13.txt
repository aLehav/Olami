After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faust Provides Weak Arguments and Makes the Wrong Choice
 
President Faust’s statement opposing divestment was disappointing. This statement was the only response to a request from Divest Harvard asking her to participate in a public forum about divestment. She used this statement as a way of sidestepping the actual request, and in doing so passed up the opportunity to engage in a productive discussion about divestment and climate change.
I am only going to address a few of the many problematic elements in her statement. President Faust seems to misunderstand the purpose of divestment. Its aim is not to affect stock prices or damage the fossil fuel industry financially. Rather, it seeks to make a statement about the immorality of profiting off an industry whose business model endangers our future. The ultimate aim is to loosen the corrupting influence that the fossil fuel industry has over our political system, which currently prevents meaningful climate legislation.
Faust’s claim that Harvard wishes to remain politically neutral is weak: It seems to imply that investments are not inherently political statements. In choosing to remain invested in these companies, Faust is choosing to continue to support and side with them over the concerns of a group of her students.
Faust makes the argument that divestment is hypocritical because our society is reliant on fossil fuels. Currently, there are very few alternatives to using fossil fuels on a daily basis. The purpose of divestment is to create space for political action and reverse this reliance. Fossil fuel companies will not change their business model willingly. Without political action, the chance of preventing catastrophic damage to our planet is very slim.
Ultimately, Faust’s statement fails to engage with an issue that she claims to recognize as “one of the world’s most consequential challenges.”

Defending Academic Inquiry
President Faust’s statement on the divestment movement is a welcome reassurance for the students, employees, and alumni of Harvard who had feared open politicization of the endowment. Pro-divestment activists have attacked her statement, but President Faust’s remarks uphold the endowment’s purpose as a means to further academic knowledge, not to pursue an agenda. Pursuing divestment would directly interfere with the academic inquiry of many students and faculty on campus.
Some divestment activists have painted any opposition as directly supporting a perceived aim of the energy sector to pollute as much as possible. This “catastrophist” view asserts that humanity will suffer doomsday in the near future, unless dependence on fossil fuels is eliminated now.  If Harvard were to divest from non-renewable energy, then the university would essentially endorse this position. There exists a wide range of theories between the extremes of climate change denial and catastrophism, but a divestment program would endorse the catastrophist position as the only legitimate one. After divestment, those at Harvard working on more gradualist theories of climate change would find themselves opposing the official position of the university. President Faust’s statement, however, acknowledges climate change as important and accepts investigation into the threats of climate change.
Additionally, the divestment position would ostracize any students and faculty who are interested in working on research regarding non-renewable resources. Engineers or EPS concentrators interested in the petroleum industry should not endure the opprobrium of the university’s official rejection of the legitimacy of their work. Overall, Harvard’s strength in the sciences would be damaged by cutting off such a large field of research and work. President Faust was right to have rejected divestment. Such a policy would declare that a wide area of academic inquiry in engineering and atmospheric sciences is illegitimate in Harvard’s eyes.

Run Toward Life
Every year, President Faust stands before the senior class and, in a fit of inspirational rhetoric, urges them to move boldly from Harvard Yard to lives not just of success, but also of commitment, decency, and courage.
Her Baccalaureate Address this May was widely shared across and beyond the wider Harvard community. To her, the existential questions, the big decisions, are the stuff of life. We are, in her view, defined by our nobility of purpose, our grace, our willingness to act. “What do we owe to one another? How should we live?” She implored the seniors, assembled in the aftermath of the Boston Bombings, to “immunize [yourselves] against an excess of scepticism...run toward life.”
President Faust once again showed herself a master observer, excising the competing pressures of material success and allegiance to a higher sense of duty that all Harvard students face. Yet her recent statement on divestment was high on rhetoric and low on courage, flagrantly embracing the very scepticism that she so often condemns.
Her letter is considerate and extensive; it demonstrates, at the very least, her willingness to evaluate divestment. At its core, however, stands a glaring flaw. She claims that we should “be very wary of steps… that would appear to position the University as a political actor rather than an academic institution.” She writes that “the endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
Yet the endowment is the resource that propels this university. Harvard is not the sum of its buildings and its investments; it’s a community of people, of ideas. Every year, President Faust charts a transformation—students who arrive at Harvard endowed with intelligence and talent are awakened, emboldened, and driven towards truth while “improvising in the face of uncertainty.”
The threats to our planet are becoming increasingly certain, the path ever clearer. If the act of grace that is a Harvard education impels its students toward social or political change, how can President Faust deny her institution the very same purpose?

Why Divest Isn’t Hypocritical
 
Among the most common arguments against “Divest” that you’ll encounter is that the movement’s goal is hypocritical. We rely on fossil fuels for our lights, our cars, and our heat, claim the detractors, so to pull the plug on the finance side is simply a confused, self-destructive gesture. This is a seductive argument—one to which I subscribed in the past. Faust even invoked it in her letter to the Harvard community, writing that we cannot jibe our “pervasive dependence” on the fossil fuel industry with financial divestment.
But it’s also a flawed argument in that it assumes the actions of institutions should always mirror those of individuals.
Though many of us care deeply about climate change and know it to be manmade, all of us consume fossil fuels anyways because we lack the funds to do otherwise, and because the alternatives are impractical given the realities of modern infrastructure. In other words, the fossil fuel industry has us at checkmate, and there is nothing substantive that any single one of us can do to resist without extreme personal sacrifice.
When we organize advocacy campaigns through an institution like Harvard, however, we undermine these infrastructural and financial confines. We overcome the capital constraints of the individual, and we exert pressure over the system that has made consumption-based resistance impractical.
Unlike the movement’s opponents, the leaders of Divest Harvard have realized that institutional resistance is a prerequisite to meaningful individual resistance. So, despite the naysayers’ claims, divestment isn’t hypocritical at all, but rather consistent—and pragmatic—to the core.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week before the most prestigious race of the fall season, the Radcliffe women’s lightweight crew team has officially hired a new coach—former Trinity College head coach Elizabeth O. Berl.
The spot opened up after the previous Radcliffe lightweight head coach Michiel Bartman left the position to become the head coach of the Harvard male lightweights.
Berl, who led Trinity to its first-ever NCAA Division III championship regatta, plans to begin a week after the Head of the Charles, Oct. 19 and 20. The new Harvard coach said joining the team midseason will be difficult, but that she is enthusiastic to begin in two weeks.
“It’s a huge honor,” Berl said. “It’ll be a challenge, but I usually rise to the occasion. I like challenges and to push myself in these situations.”
Berl had previously expressed interest in the position of Radcliffe lightweight head coach to Radcliffe heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary. When the position was vacated, Berl said that O’Leary immediately contacted her. Within a day, Berl was on the phone with Patricia Henry, Harvard’s senior associate athletic director.
“She’s wonderful, and she will be a dynamic and strong leader for the lightweight program,” O’Leary said. “I think it will be pretty fun, and there will be a lot of energy. Hopefully we can build two really stout teams this year.”
O’Leary said she anticipated little difficulty for the lightweights as they transition between coaches. Although new hires typically have the bulk of the summer to acclimate to Cambridge, Leary said that, with the most crucial races to come in the spring, Berl will have ample time to adjust.
“She will have time to get to know the team and their strengths and weaknesses. It is [only] October, and we do have a full year ahead of us,” O’Leary said.
A former member of the U.S. Junior National team, Berl started her own rowing clinic out of her garage in Davidson, N.C. after leaving her job at Trinity. In her clinic, Berl trained students and adults of all levels.
Berl said that she is already in contact with the Radcliffe lightweight rowers and assistant coach Lauren Fisher and that she will remain in communication until her arrival on campus on Oct. 28.
“The team has gone through a lot. They have gotten great coaching this fall, but I think they are ready to have a coach full time,” Berl said. “I am really looking forward to getting to know them as individuals, and I am very excited to work with these great young women.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team’s game against Cornell turned into a duel between a backup quarterback and an NFL prospect. The backup emerged on top.
With starting quarterback Conner Hempel inactive with a knee injury, Crimson coach Tim Murphy asked senior Michael Pruneau to battle the Big Red’s Jeff Mathews, who has been on the NFL radar while breaking Ivy League records.
Pruneau started slow at Schoellkopf Field, throwing an interception to end his first drive. But he rarely faltered after that. Though Mathews finished with 472 yards, it was Pruneau who left Ithaca, N.Y., with a 34-24 win thanks to a stingy defense and some brilliant plays of his own.
The two signal-callers traded touchdowns for most of the second half, but Pruneau and the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) held a lead throughout. Three times Mathews and the Big Red (1-3, 0-2) cut the gap to three with a score, but Harvard responded on the ensuing drive each time.
Mathews' last score came with 6:36 left as he dove in himself. Up 27-24, Murphy had the option of telling Pruneau and the offense to burn the clock, but the coach decided otherwise.
“Coaches were calling plays to win the game and that’s what we intended to do,” Pruneau said, “And that’s what we did.”
Pruneau opened the drive with two passes to move across midfield. On a crucial third down a few plays later, senior Ricky Zorn reached out to snag a pass over the middle and move the chains.
One play later, Pruneau went for the win with a deep pass to senior tight end Cam Brate. Brate, who appeared to be nursing an injured finger earlier in the game, leapt up and brought the pass down in the end zone before falling out of bounds. The touchdown put Harvard up, 34-24, and Mathews was unable to find a response.
Pruneau finished the game with 340 yards on 23-of-29 passing, bouncing back from his early interception.
When sophomore Eric Medes gave the Crimson offense great field position by returning an interception to the Cornell 17 midway through the first, Pruneau took advantage. On the third play of the drive, Pruneau scored the game’s first points with a three-yard touchdown keeper.
In the second quarter, the Big Red tallied 191 yards of offense but only three points. Cornell’s first field goal attempt was good, but its second was blocked and its third strayed wide left in the closing seconds of the first half.
"We've got to be more efficient out there and not leave it up to the kicker," Mathews said. "We didn’t get points and that hurts you."
Both sides opened the second half with a touchdown. Later in the third, Mathews engineered one of his team's several long drives, marching 75 yards over five minutes. The possession ended with a seven-yard touchdown pass that brought Cornell within 3, 20-17.
But Harvard would respond early in the fourth. Pruneau spearheaded a 65-yard drive that included a pair of 28-yard passes. Sophomore running back Paul Stanton ended the drive with three straight rushes, the last of which was a two-yard touchdown push that put Harvard up, 27-17.
Midway through the fourth quarter, Mathews had Cornell driving once again. Four straight complete passes pushed the Big Red to Harvard’s 22, but then Mathews committed his most costly mistake of the game.
Evading pressure, the senior rolled out and then lobbed a pass to the middle of the field. Senior defensive back Reynaldo Kirton made a break on the ball and came down with it. Harvard’s second interception of the game promptly ended the scoring threat.
But Cornell would be in scoring range again soon. The Crimson went three-and-out before punting from its own end zone, giving the Big Red the ball at the Harvard 44.
A pass interference penalty in the end zone a few plays later gave Cornell a first and goal at the one.  On the next play, Mathews kept the ball himself, diving into the end zone to cut Harvard’s lead to 27-24 with 6:36 left.
Mathews' 472 passing yards is the most ever against Harvard.
"I made the statement after Jeff Mathews' sophomore year that he’d be at least a 3rd round draft pick," Murphy said. "I would absolutely stand by that."
But Mathews had no answer to Pruneau's final touchdown pass to Brate. The Big Red got the ball back with 2:46 left but Mathews was sacked twice and threw two incompletions before turning the ball over on downs.
On the day, Harvard tallied six sacks while Pruneau was only brought down three times.
"I'm just proud of our kids. Nothing has come particularly easy for us this season, but at crunch time we’ve really responded and shown a great deal of character and resiliency," Murphy said. "I think that was the case again today. We found a way to win."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At last! Round one of midterms is finally coming to a close, so stand up and give yourself a big pat on the back! We at The Back Page understand that these past few days have certainly been trying times. For example, we know that you probably had to deal with your friends and peers going slightly insane for the first time last week. In fact, you likely saw many of them passed out over their books in some of the strangest locations imaginable. The scariest part about the whole week though is that there is a pretty good chance that you were one of these people as well!
Nevertheless, do not worry! You were not alone in your struggle. Besides, you made it to the finish line, and consequently, The Back Page has another reward for you: another installment of Tweets of the Week! Here are our favorite tweets from Harvard athletes who were able to find a break from studying to digress through social media.
4. Continuing with the theme of midterms, junior basketball player Jonah Travis will certainly tell you that our rant was accurate.
“You know its midterm week when you see someone add Red Bull to their drink at 2am #itsthatserious”
Only 2 a.m.? Must have been a freshman.
3. Freshman basketball player Matt Fraschilla returns to our list this week with a metaphor he decided to share on Sunday.
“Peyton manning is to an NFL team what Woody was to the group of toys in Toy Story. ‪#fieldgeneral”
This analogy is simply too perfect. They’re both leaders, they both came back from injuries, and they both even have deals with pizza places (Pizza Planet and Papa Johns)! English teachers everywhere salute you Matt.
2. T.J. Laurisch, a sophomore baseball player, has a question that we would like to help him out with.
“Why is there a petting zoo here? #UnansweredQuestions”
Let’s think. If a rising high school senior is considering one college that has a petting zoo and one college that does not, is it really a question which one he is going to choose in the end? The perks of a large endowment fund…Thanks Harvard. #AnsweredQuestion
1. Junior punter for the football team David Bicknell sounds like he is proud to call Cambridge home.
“I just saw a dog that had actual dreads as his hair. Not his whole body but on his head like a person. Dread head dog roamin round Cambridge”
Looks like we have our first Snoop Dogg sighting in Cambridge. #snoop-a-loop

In ‘Quotes of the Week’, The Back Page will look each weekend at the five best quotes of the week, providing context for the five best moments from the past seven days in Crimson sports.
“When I made the first cut, I pretty much saw daylight. So I knew I was going to be able to score. When I actually scored, it was the greatest feeling ever, the fact that we came out on top of such a game, one of the most brutal games I have played through. It was just a great feeling that I was able to do that for my team.” –Paul Stanton ‘16
The Crimson emerged from a grueling triple overtime contest with Holy Cross last Saturday, beating the Crusaders 41-35. Sophomore running back Paul Stanton scored from 17 yards out to win the game for Harvard, earning the John Turco Memorial Trophy for his performance, an award presented during Holy Cross’ annual homecoming game to the most outstanding player.
“The game that we played today was such a good team game. Every opportunity that we had was created by everyone on the team doing their job, and doing it at a 107,000 percent effort. It was so great to be a part of.” –Xanni Brown ‘14
Coming off a loss against Dartmouth the previous weekend, the women’s rugby team dominated Brown 57-7 last Saturday. The team came out strong from the start, scoring in under seven minutes and maintaining a sizeable lead until the final whistle.
“It was one of the more impressive performances I’ve seen as a coach. [Leakos] has been working hard, and you can see that he’s approaching training with a new mentality.” –cross country coach Jason Saretsky.
After finishing first at the Harvard-Yale cross country meet three weeks ago, co-captain James Leakos won the Paul Short Invitational 8k course this past weekend. Leakos raced among a talented pack of runners in Bethlehem, Penn. with a 23:13 time, running an impressive 4:21 per mile.
 
“We would love to win every game. But if we come out with a couple wins and a couple losses and progress as a team, that’s what we really want to do.” –Elizabeth Jacobson ‘16
The field hockey team beat UMass-Lowell 4-0 on Wednesday, ending its three-game losing streak. The Crimson got goals coming from three different players.
“I think we feel good. I think that we’re just looking to Cornell, just focusing on one game at a time, so we went through today, and now it’s all about focusing on Cornell and keeping that unbeaten streak.” –Elizabeth Weisman ‘14
Ending their six game winning streak, the Crimson tied BU Tuesday night. With no score on the board at the buzzer, the double overtime ended, 1-1, with the sole goal coming from freshman Midge Purce. Harvard remains undefeated in the Ivy League heading into its match against Cornell on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In advance of Harvard football’s game against Cornell, THC football beat writers David Steinbach and Samantha Lin discuss a number of important topics about the team.
On Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews… 
 
Samantha Lin: Jeff Mathews has certainly come into this season with high expectations—he’s the sole FCS quarterback on the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award watch list and is predicted to be drafted into the NFL after this year. Do you think he deserves all of the praise and expectations? 
 
David Steinbach: Maybe. Over three games, Mathews has racked up 972 yards and eight touchdowns, and he just became the leader in all-time Ivy League passing yards. But Cornell is just 1-3 (0-1 in the conference) and hasn’t been able to generate any offense on the ground to complement Mathews, making the Big Red a very one-dimensional team. 
 
SL: I think his experience as a third-year starter will definitely help in that aspect. Even when teams know that Cornell is a pass-happy team, his prowess still makes him tricky to cover—he averages over 300 yards passing per game. The team may not have been able to pull out a win in the last two games, but it did put up over 40 points in its first game against Bucknell.
DS: The Harvard defense is going to need to make some adjustments in its pass coverage if it hopes to stop Mathews. Against a relatively inexperienced freshman quarterback in Holy Cross’s Peter Pujals, the Crimson gave up over 300 yards passing and surrendered four touchdowns. Another performance like that will make it tough to come out of Ithaca with a win. 
 
On turnovers forced by the Harvard defense… 
 
DS: Last week against Holy Cross, the Harvard defense forced Pujals to fumble four times. The Crimson recovered each of these loose balls and returned one of them for a touchdown. 
 
SL: That’s not to mention when the special teams unit blocked a punt on the first possession of the game. The Harvard defense has scored a touchdown in each of its first three games and bailed the offense out when it’s been sputtering. 
 
DS: Defensive end Zach Hodges has been nothing short of a beast. So far this season, the junior has forced a fumble, recovered a fumble to score a touchdown, intercepted a pass, and registered 2.5 sacks.  We’re looking at a potential candidate for Ivy League Player of the Year here. 
 
SL: His performance thus far is a big reason why he was my preseason Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year prediction. But that’s not to take away credit from the rest of the defensive line, which combined for six sacks last week. If the defense hadn’t had that crucial sack in the third overtime period, the outcome last week may have been different. 
 
On Harvard’s quarterback situation… 
 
SL: It looks like Harvard’s starting quarterback, Conner Hempel, may be questionable for Saturday’s game due to lingering effects from a hyperextended knee suffered in Worcester. The Crimson’s backup quarterback, Mike Pruneau, struggled when he came in for Hempel this week. Although he was 8-of-10 passing last week, he struggled to create offense while Hempel was sidelined. 
 
DS: Hempel has been the focal point of the Harvard offense so far this year. He has shown poise under pressure, and when the pocket breaks down he has demonstrated an ability to improvise and make plays on the run. And when the Crimson couldn’t get anything going on the ground in the first two games of the year, Hempel more than picked up the slack, throwing for 641 yards and five touchdowns. 
 
SL: But if Hempel is unable to go, it probably won’t be the end of the world for Harvard. Pruneau, despite not winning the starting job, has more experience with the team as a senior. Even though he tore his ACL last year and was unable to play his junior year, he still trained with the team and was able to become a solid leader within the team. He’s also been getting quite a few reps this week, according to a teammate, just in case Hempel is still not ready by Saturday. 
 
DS: The preseason competition where the two battled for the starting position will probably help him too, if he needs to come in for the start. Both have repeatedly talked about how the battle made them better leaders and players. That may be put to the test come Saturday.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock (or a pile of p-sets in the corner of Lamont), you’ve probably heard that chemistry professor emeritus Martin Karplus just won a Nobel Prize. This, according to The Crimson, was for his innovations in “computer simulations using classical physics and quantum mechanics that could improve scientists’ understanding of complex reactions and the development of new drugs." If you’re anything like us, you’re very impressed, and also have no idea what this actually means. For your benefit, we’ve broken down this scientific jargon into language even Folklore and Mythology concentrators can understand.
WARNING: The following definitions have been provided by a sarcastic humanities concentrator who has only ever stepped foot in the Science Center to buy chai tea lattés from the Greenhouse Café.
“Computer simulations”
As anyone who took the verbal portion of the SAT in high school knows, “to simulate” means to excite or arouse, and often has a sexual connotation. Wait, nope, our mistake, that’s “stimulate.” Simulate means to take on the appearance of, so we can infer that that the Nobel Prize committee selected Karplus on account of his excellent computer costume last Halloween. We have yet to confirm the exact nature of this costume, but we’d like to imagine that Karplus wore a giant cardboard box painted to resemble a PC and spent the night making beeping noises.
“Classical physics”
Physics is that mysterious field being explored somewhere deep in the bowels of the Science Center. We can’t say for sure, but it probably has something to do with really big numbers. Also magnets. There’s definitely something going on with magnets. Anyway, we figure that classical physics is probably basically the same thing as regular physics, except you have to make all of your calculations while wearing a powdered wig and shout “Eureka!” every few minutes.
“Quantum mechanics”
The word “quantum” comes from the Latin root “quantus,” meaning “complicated mathy stuff that we don’t understand because we fulfilled our empirical reasoning requirement with Anthropology 1010.”
“Scientists’ Understanding of Complex Reactions”
Karplus’s research must have been dedicated to helping hopelessly socially awkward chemists understand the complex emotional reactions of the significant others in their lives. For instance, when your girlfriend asks you whether her dress makes her look fat and you say, “Well, you might look better in something else,” why does she burst into tears and smash the Nobel Prize you just won on the coffee table? Scientists have been grappling with this problem for thousands of Friday nights.
“The development of new drugs”
We imagine that the new drugs inspired by Karplus’s work could include those really tiny round pills that always fall in your drain, the drugs that come in childproof boxes that are so difficult to open you’d rather just stay sick anyway, and Red Bull. We feel obligated to note that we predict that side effects include leprosy, the plague, and that tiny speck in the corner of your eye that just won’t go away no matter how many times you rub it.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight.
Princeton is notorious for its grade deflation policy, but that may be up for a change—Princeton’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, has convened a faculty committee to review the policy, the Daily Princetonian reports. Students won’t sit on the committee, according to the Prince. (Apparently, reviewing a policy governing how students are graded doesn’t require students doing the reviewing.)
 
Perhaps, if this policy review eventually results in the elimination of the grade deflation policy, Harvard won’t be the subject of so many grade inflation jokes. Or we probably still will.
 
At Yale, a residential college laundry room has been terrorized by a so-called “poopetrator” who—you guessed it—has been pooping on people’s laundry. As of almost a week ago, the individual (or individuals, we suppose, though we’ll be even more disgusted if this turns out to be a group crime, because, well, gross) responsible for this disgusting series of events hadn’t yet been caught, according to the Yale Daily News.
 
Dartmouth Greek life again came under scrutiny when Gawker published a piece detailing email correspondences among members of the school’s Beta Alpha Omega fraternity. The conversations Gawker published covered the frat’s initiation rituals, pledge information, and the chapter president’s response to the possibility that a sexual assault suspect may have attended a party at the frat.
Beta, apparently, made the mistake of making their Google group public. If only they had learned from the Isis.
