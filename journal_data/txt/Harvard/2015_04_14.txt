Bulgarian writer Georgi Gospodinov’s “The Physics of Sorrow” unites formal experimentation with emotional resonance in a compelling exploration of how and why humans tell stories. Through an endlessly inventive series of playful, moving retellings of the Minotaur myth, Gospodinov recounts his family’s history and his own autobiography. At times the narrative is frustratingly complex, less a linear plot than a maze of allusions and digressions. Yet the deep feeling and the specificity of Gospodinov’s writing render the story consistently engaging despite its many twists and turns.
In Greek mythology, the Minotaur was a creature with the head of a bull and the body of a man, who terrorized the Athenians by eating several of their youths every year; the hero Theseus famously found and killed this carnivore, in the depths of a labyrinth in Crete. The novel deconstructs and reimagines the birth, life, and murder of the Minotaur, who is sympathetically presented as a lonely and abandoned child. Gospodinov analyzes interpretations of the myth in the works of Ovid, Virgil, and Dante, presents the monster as real person whom his grandfather once saw exhibited at a circus, and even explores how he himself, living in a basement apartment in communist Bulgaria in the 1980s, has come to resemble the creature. The motif of the labyrinth built to contain the Minotaur also recurs throughout the novel in intriguing ways: Gospodinov ruminates on the mazelike structures of the human brain, of cities, and of books themselves.
The fragmentary and disjointed form also gives the writing a labyrinthine complexity. In some ways, Gospodinov’s novel reads like an encyclopedia of the techniques and preoccupations of postmodern fiction.The narrator at one point describes his work as “a book containing every kind and genre. From monologue through Socratic dialogue to epos in hexameter, from fairytales through treatises to lists. From high antiquity to slaughterhouse instructions.” Both this multiplicity of genres and the narrator’s consciousness about literary technique challenge conventional definitions of fiction. The work is divided into short sections with titles ranging from the trivial “Four Seconds From the ’90s” to the profound “Death Is a Cherry Tree That Ripens Without Us.” Frequent shifts from first to third person and between the memories and thoughts of different characters render the narrator impossible to identify. The novel’s allusiveness adds yet another layer of complexity—the narrator, for instance, meets teenage girls who are “Lolitas, without having read ‘Lolita.’” This frequent use of referencing draws attention to the ways in which any perceptions and interpretations of the novel are structured by other stories. The success of “The Physics of Sorrow” lies not in its coherence as a narrative, but in its thoughtful exploration of how narratives are constructed and understood.
Despite playing with the conventions of fiction, Gospodinov successfully avoids sacrificing meaning to formal experimentation for its own sake. In a description that certainly fits his own work, Gospodinov writes that “[s]ome books need to be equipped with Ariadne’s thread. The corridors are constantly intertwining, crisscrossing one another.” Through the twisting path of Gospodinov’s novel runs a constant thread of compelling emotional intensity. Though narrated in brief snippets of memory, Gospodinov’s retelling of his great-grandmother’s abandonment of his grandfather, then three years old, loses none of its searing immediacy: When his grandfather realizes that he is alone, “the fear wells up, filling him, just like when they fill the little pitcher at the well, the water surges, pushing the air out and overflowing.” The melancholy—the double sense of loss and being lost—that pervades the adult Gospodinov’s wanderings through Europe is no less vividly evoked. The scent of lilies as he strolls through Rouen for the first time recalls to him “a memory of my grandma’s house, the lilies at the back of the yard…. Everything seen is projected somewhere there, in the lost country of childhood. The ideal city lies there…and in all of our later wanderings, we can only note its likenesses.”
Gospodinov’s language in itself is also compelling. In his work, even the most mundane experiences become revelations. He describes waking up from an afternoon nap and finding that “the room, lit up by the autumn sun, has come alive. One ray passes right through the massive glass ashtray on the table, breaking the light down into its constituent colors. Even the long-dead, mummified fly next to it looks exquisite and sparkles like a forgotten earring.” Gospodinov juxtaposes the grotesque and the beautiful in a passage that is at once concrete and transcendent. Like the sunlight described in this passage, his words have the power to transfigure the commonplace into the sublime. At one point, the narrator declares, “In the small and the insignificant—that’s where life hides, that’s where it builds its nest.” For all its abstract, cerebral play with story structure and its exploration of grand myths, the novel also exalts the beauty of the specific, of the trivial details of everyday life. Moments of lyricism, of clarity and enchantment, punctuate the narrative like pearls strung along a thread.
Both an intellectual game and a very human story, “The Physics of Sorrow” captivates. If at times the novel’s postmodern experimentation seems self-consciously clever and its plot confusing, the insights offered by its deconstruction of myth and its exploration of family, memory, and loss are worth the effort required to unravel its tangled skein.

If audiences expected “GHOST” to be a thoroughly heart-warming story, one that would reassure them that everything is going to be okay or leave them emotionally satisfied, then they were mistaken. With its short scenes and occasionally drawn-out dialogues, the play had a rhythm that seemed odd and uneasy. However, that might have been exactly what playwright Emma R. Adler ’16, an active Crimson arts editor, and director Allegra C. Caldera ’17 wanted the audience to experience. “GHOST,” which ran April 9–12 in the Adams Pool Theater, put great trust in its audience’s capacity for reflection and ability to allow the dissatisfaction of the play to evolve into a deeper meaning. “GHOST” was not the type of play to see on a whim—it was not a tale of character growth that could be wrapped up neatly and tied with a bow, but rather a very real sliver of life. The play was a balancing act of drama and comedy executed, for the most part, gracefully and skillfully.
Lucy, played adeptly by Nina C. Sapers ’17, is a college senior who returns home to handle the death of her cancer-stricken mother. She must confront various elements of the past: her high-school boyfriend Ian (played by Nicolas E. O’Connor ’17), her relatives, and even strangers from her mother’s teenage years. Despite the darkness of the situation, Adler deftly used comedy to sprinkle reminders throughout the play that life goes on. For example, in one scene Lucy’s father inquires about her love life in an inept and quintessentially awkward manner, giving the audience room both to relate and laugh.
The play’s name worked on multiple levels. Most obviously, it addressed the haunting presence of Lucy’s dead mother, but it was also the name of a game which Lucy used to play with Ian. Games were a near-omnipresent symbol in the play. “Everything bad that can happen to you is a form of losing,” one character memorably mused. Each scene was introduced with a title card with the name of a different game that related to its contents. For example, “20 Questions” came when Lucy encountered a rather inquisitive stranger, played by Stephen J. Kim ’15, while waiting for the bus; “Taboo,” when Lucy met several individuals who did not understand social graces at her mother’s funeral reception; and “Guess Who?”, when a mystery guest showed up unannounced. This clever structure kept the momentum of the play lively and jaunty–a necessary contrast to the otherwise dark and heavy content.
However, the production had a slightly awkward start due to several technical errors. At some points, the lights did not shine on the correct part of the stage, and at others the title cards were not flipped in the correct sequence. The Adams Pool Theater’s limited space resulted in some rather clumsy set changes; within scenes, however, the actors took full advantage of the set. After working out the initial kinks of awkward technical direction, Sapers played the lead with conviction and believability as someone attempting to clumsily fumble on with life while dealing with profound tragedy. Jack C. Smith ’15, who played Lucy’s brother Brian, and Nathaniel Brodsky ’18, who played Lucy’s father Hal, nicely conveyed the strange beauty of still being able to joke with relatives even during a time of extreme sadness; in one scene after the funeral, there was a remarkably true moment when Lucy and her brother began to argue about which television channel to watch and then broke down in laughter. The actors’ skillful portrayals bolstered what was already a moving script.
Unfortunately, the ending of “GHOST” failed to maintain the play’s momentum. Most unsettling was the absence of artistic conclusion; by the final scene of the play, the theme of games was entirely lost, aside from its technical role in the division of scenes. One more reference to the game GHOST or another mention of what it means to win or lose in life might have given the play a sense of completion without too overtly tidying up the story. Despite the play’s minor flaws, however, Adler undeniably hit on moments of pure truth in the quick, hour-long runtime; “GHOST” remained haunting long after the lights dimmed.

The title of Irish writer Alf MacLochlainn’s new short story collection, “Past Habitual,” refers to an infrequently referenced English verb tense. The habitual past, usually expressed through the words “would” or “used to,” describes an action that happened and continued to happen; it appears most often in narrations of nostalgia or memory. This term successfully encapsulates the collection’s tone and thematic focus. Saturated in longing and recollection, “Past Habitual” expresses its preoccupation with the past through a series of maneuvers as technical as its name: The book tries to capture expansive personal and political histories by utilizing a range of voices and language forms, many of which are unusually experimental. Most of these attempts at massive profundity and inventive genius fall flat, though. The stories are intriguing and emotional, but they consistently fail to reach an upper tier of meaning.
The collection’s primary strength is its variety of well-developed narrative voices. Characters include a modern-day civil servant in search of a heraldry expert, a member of a boarding school marching band, and a reporter writing about Easter Week, 1916; while the speakers vary in age, time period, and connection to the country, they relate to one another through elements of Ireland’s politics, culture, or history.
Through tone and syntax, MacLochlainn manages to make every narrator an authentic-sounding person with distinctive internal patterns. The narrator of “Daisy Daisy” reveals himself to be sensitive and slightly inarticulate from his first sentence, saying, “I try to pretend to myself that I can keep them all at arm’s length, it has nothing to do with me, they are just old acquaintances, but it doesn’t really hold up.” This casual, conversational language remains consistent throughout the story, providing a meticulous and subtle outline of the speaker’s inner life. The radically different narrator of “Demolition of a gnome house” uses equally distinctive language. An intuitive child, he starts his narration with the simple statement, “There was always an envelope.” The envelope signifies money, and the rest of the story unfolds in a progression of similarly uninformed but perceptive statements appropriate to the character.
Aided by this narrator-specific language, many of the the stories develop a strong and appealing sense of intimacy. Small domestic moments—a first kiss, a first kill—become even more vivid and moving than their thundering historical backgrounds. In “Demolition of a gnome house,” the young narrator’s careful sense of duty and anxiety about his family’s monetary troubles becomes deeply touching; the narrator of “Why did I volunteer to kill the kittens” describes his admiration of an early girlfriend with equal sensitivity and detail.
Even so, the stories remain slightly inadequate, slightly bereft of an extra jolt of surprise or significance. The author seems to want to create stories with Joycean epiphanies, but the stories are slightly flat: “Daisy Daisy,” for one, describes a town’s reaction to a girl’s unplanned pregnancy, and while it captures the characters and culture with sufficient clarity, it conveys no lingering sense of importance, newness, or depth. The story attempts to introduce an additional thematic dimension by way of a symbol—feces as fertilizer—but fails to make the connection seem universalizing or especially intricate. Other stories make similar bids at meaning but end up mired in overstatement and melodrama: The otherwise-strong “Demolition of a gnome house” ends with a slightly absurd description of a boy’s collapsed mud castle. MacLochlainn writes, “The solid universe lies uncharitable before me and I stand up to the full height of a seven-year-old boy. Through the tears streaming from my eyes I can barely see the collapsing gnome-house as it falls in ruins in the dust about my feet.” The author tries to imbue a childhood event with tragic significance but veers too far towards the theatrical, turning a supposedly weighty and sorrowful moment into an unintentionally flimsy and comedic one.
Sometimes, the writing becomes stuck in an opposite trap. Aching with nostalgia, the author tends to slip into overly-detailed, plodding descriptions of processes: He goes into enormous detail about the construction of a weapon for a schoolboy’s chestnut fight, the architecture of a clock in a civil service building, and so on. The descriptions are possibly meant to add interest, local color, or thematic significance. Mostly, though, they bring the narrative pace to an absolute halt.
Other writing strategies pose similar problems. MacLochlainn toys endlessly with format, including quasi-poetic fragments from a paper shredder, a variety of fonts, and paragraphs titled “DOT no. 1.” Most bizarrely, he prefaces “The minstrel boy” with an onomatopoetic stream-of-consciousness. Lines range from “DOOM-bang FIFING PIPING” to “Out from the shadow of the stand BOOM BANG.” The section almost seems like a nod to the “Sirens” section of “Ulysses,” in which James Joyce precedes a section about music with an lyric version of an orchestra warming up. The technique, though, doesn’t work as well for MacLochlainn as it does for Joyce. As is true for most of the other format experiments, it proves to be inoffensive but unnecessary. “The minstrel boy” would lose nothing if the section were taken out, just as the fancy fonts add nothing to “Dot-and-carry-on.”
The collection, taken as a whole, evidences extensive literary knowledge and intense ambition. “Past Habitual” clearly involves emotion and research and time; the author cares deeply about his technique and his subject matter, and it shows. Still, the entire project might have been much more successful had MacLochlainn resigned himself to simpler goals. Clean style and thematic impact are undervalued here, and the result is an interesting but rather muddled product.

Renata Adler’s writing is not for the lily-livered. In the preface to “After the Tall Timber,” a new collection of her previously published essays, Michael Wolff, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and fellow New York journalist, writes “I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that her writing is some of the most brutal ever directed at journalism itself.” Adler, a former staff writer for The New Yorker, one-year chief film critic of the New York Times, and author of two novels, has a sharp tongue and sharper pen. Her journalistic and critical writing in this collection is generally acute, invigorating, and informative.
“After the Tall Timber” draws a broad, compelling sample from three collections of Adler’s work, “Toward a Radical Middle” (1970), “A Year in the Dark” (1969), and “Canaries in the Mineshaft” (2001), as well as featuring previously uncollected work. In 21 essays, she tackles all manner of topics: representations of violence in movies, the Starr Report, Watergate, Civil Rights marches, and journalism itself, to name a few. The phrase “After the Tall Timber” comes from her introduction to “Canaries in the Mineshaft,” included in this book. As part of a larger cry against journalists seeking name recognition, Adler writes, “There still existed what Mary McCarthy, in another context, called ‘the last of the tall timber.’ But the tall timber in journalism is largely gone—replaced, as in many fields, by the phenomenon of celebrity.” The irony of course is that Adler has become a figure of some celebrity, in part for pieces like this, and the ambivalence of the title powerfully captures the fraught and controversial nature of her own position as a journalist, author, and celebrity.
The complexity of Adler’s role as a journalist in part stems from her unique political perspective. She positions herself at once as a centrist—the ultimate insider—and a radical—the ultimate outsider. She puts herself forth as both a populist and iconoclast, as a renegade writer and as an articulator of the most fundamental, broadly agreed upon American values, which makes for complicated, fascinating writing. In her introduction to “Towards a Radical Middle,” included here, Adler stakes out a space for what she identifies as an as-of-yet-unarticulated political position: a radicalized centrism. She feels that both the radical left and right of the ’60s have their failings, and she is interested in rearticulating certain centrist beliefs in a forceful and powerful way. “Our values are corny ones, reason, decency, prosperity, human dignity, contact, the finest, broadest possible America.” Her political analysis is not entirely convincing in that it relies on a false appeal to a majority, but the position she sets up for herself as a journalist and cultural critic is intriguing.
Adler’s exploration of the contested outsider-insider, centrist-radical dynamic is particularly prominent in her two essays about Civil Rights marches, included in this collection: “The March for Non-Violence from Selma” and “The Black Power March in Mississippi.” She thrusts herself into the thick of events and reports them as they are, in a thorough, unsparing fashion. Her coverage often comes off as unduly harsh—she has a talent for collecting unfortunate and unflattering quotations. In one instance, she cites a student concerned about Maoists who defines them like so: “A Maoist. You know. From the Mau Mau.” What is redeeming about these essays, however, is that the writing is grounded in firm, morally sound convictions. Adler ends her essay on the Black Power march with an an inspiring gesture of solidarity: “The black man’s rights are law—and for the white community to resist or ignore the law implies the collapse of an entire legal and moral system. It has become intolerable to the black man to win so slowly what is his by right.” That Adler’s criticisms here, as elsewhere—of what she views as stupidity, falseness, and any other number of sins—stem from this strong moral core keeps them from slipping into the merely vitriolic or vituperative.
The author is equally unsparing in her representation of her field and her critiques of her peers, in part because she has such high expectations of and hopes for the craft. This collection includes what Wolff terms “the famous or infamous piece”: “House Critic,” a lengthy, powerfully vicious takedown of The New Yorker’s iconic longtime film critic, Pauline Kael. Adler is no fan of Kael’s writing, not merely because she finds it bad but even more because she feels that it threatens some of what she loves most. “What really is at stake is not movies at all, but prose and the relation between writers and readers, and of course art,” she writes. These are heavy accusations, but they are largely substantiated by the essay. The essay is therefore not merely invective against Kael, though in one large section it is simply quotations from Kael’s work. “House Critic,” a meticulous, unforgiving recounting of what Adler views as Kael’s flaws, is an exhilarating read, a quality that stems in no small part from the schadenfreude Adler invokes.
Adler’s writing is far from flawless. Her essays are often overlong and overstuffed. Sometimes this is more forgivable: In “House Critic,” she says of writing after reading Kael’s work that “it becomes hard—even in reviewing Ms. Kael’s work—to write in any other way.” Sometimes it is less so. Her political analyses often miss the mark, and her trademark viciousness can be written in too heavy of a hand. But when Adler’s writing coheres into something merciless yet moral, centrist yet radical, it soars. “After the Tall Timber” is almost always an absorbing, enlivening read.

Mary-Grace R. Reeves ’16 is a chemistry concentrator currently living in Lowell. As an arts educator focused on bringing ballet to a larger population, she currently spearheads two major ballet instruction initiatives: The Harvard Chapter of the Boston Ballet College Ambassadors Program and the American Girl Book Club. The former focuses on making ballet accessible to college students in the Boston area, and the latter seeks to instill an appreciation of dance in young children through literature, particularly with the “American Girl” book series.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you first begin dancing ballet?
Mary-Grace R. Reeves: I started dancing when I was five. I began with all different types of styles—with ballet, of course, but also with tap and jazz—and as I got older, I realized that ballet was my favorite. I just love how it combines artistry, choreography, but also...athleticism. Looking back, I think that ballet is just so important for developing skills that apply outside the dance world—skills like self-confidence [and] determination.
THC: You’ve mentioned that, ever since you were a little girl, you’ve wanted to do ballet. What about the art form do you think draws the interest of young children?
MRR: I think that ballet’s unique because of how it combines that demonstration of such strength with that creative performance factor. And it also builds a community of dancers. It’s very similar to a team sport in the fact that you have your other members of your ballet organization who are always there to support you and cheer for you.
THC: You’re currently at the helm of a youth outreach program focusing on ballet. Where did the idea for this initiative come from?
MRR: The…program was really inspired by a luncheon that I attended during my freshman year. I was invited by Dean Thomas Dingman to his house to have a luncheon with [Yo-Yo Ma] and a couple other students. Yo-Yo Ma...inspired me [here] because he was discussing how he has such a passion for his music, but even more so he wants to share his music with the greater audience and especially with children…. So I started thinking about this and realized that I, at Harvard, had the opportunity to unite my interest in ballet [and] my passion for literacy...to really inspire girls to...realize that reading can allow them to do anything…. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with the “American Girl” book series?
THC: I am.
MRR: Well, then you know that girls really embrace this series because it teaches them how to make a difference in their communities from a young age by learning about these historical characters. That was the book series that I used to build this curriculum for this program that I started in 2008 and have led since then. But here at Harvard, I was able to develop a unique branch of that program using a newer part of that series based on a girl named Isabelle, who’s a nine year old dancer. She faces obstacles on the path to learning to be a performer...so her stories really teach anyone about determination and self-confidence. So I was able to build that program [for] Arts First. Now I lead it there for each Arts First celebration through partnership with PBHA and the Harvard Dance Center.
THC: How do you think the instruction the girls receive under your program will impact their lives?
MRR: Well, what I did over the summer after my sophomore year in addition to leading this program at Arts First was bring it back to my hometown in Florida.... And with that, I was able to see many of the girls I’d been seeing monthly...really talk with their families, and hear a perspective from their point of view about what their girls enjoyed about the program.... What really struck me was how they talked about, in one girl’s case, how much she had developed as a person through the program.... For example, this girl, in particular, was homeschooled. She’d been pulled out of her public elementary school because she’d been bullied. She had Asperger’s syndrome. When she came to her first program, I remember her sitting with her mother in the corner of the room. She didn’t feel as though...she was a part of this community yet, but to see her grow—to see her excitement about reading be so energetic—was something that really struck me and that I will always remember.

While a duet is typically defined as some sort of performance between two people, the Harvard Dance Program’s spring show, “Duetti,” challenges this definition. The show, which runs from April 10 through April 18 at the Harvard Dance Center, consists of seven pieces, ranging from contemporary to ballet to tap. Each dance is comprised of some form of duet or multiple sets of duets, including dances with the expected two students as well as one with nine dancers to express varying notions of a duet. As Harvard Dance Director Jill Johnson explains, the term “duet” can have many different interpretations—perhaps the duet between the dancer and the music, the duality of movement, or duets in an ensemble piece—for the audience members of “Duetti” to discover.
The performance features Harvard students primarily from the Harvard Dance Project, a performance research course, and those from Music 103r: “Masterwork: The Choreographic Process of William Forsythe.” Four of the dances feature choreography from guest choreographers, created for student dancers during intensive periods of three to seven days in which the choreographer was at Harvard. After this period, the student dancers completed rehearsals leading up to the performances without the advice of their choreographer. “We were trying to build a story versus just learning what the steps where and what the timing was,” says Aru Gonzalez, a student at the Graduate School of Education, who worked with choreographer Francesca Harper. “It was more of a rounded experience, so onstage we don’t really have to worry about what the steps are—more we have to remember what the intention is, and the steps come after.”
The movement in the dances focuses a lot on connection between two people, though each duet contains different hints of character. For instance, Aysha Upchurch, a student at the Graduate School of Education, plays a distinct character in the show: she and her partner are close friends who have each other’s backs. Though the piece, set to the song “I Raise Hell,” is focused on tap dancing, it also includes humor and character, adding a narrative to the dancing. “It’s a tap piece, but it’s not just a tap piece,” Upchurch says. “We raise hell. I think a lot of the influence came from the style of the music and lyrics.”
Both Johnson and Gonzalez stress the importance of external academic influences on the choreographic and preparation process for the show. Gonzalez says that Johnson is receptive to what students are learning in other classes as well as their other interests. Particularly interested in psychology, he says a lot of what he is learning in psychology is infused into the choreography. Additionally, Johnson adds that the choreographic process influenced students outside of the studio. “Some students have expressed that being in the studio and working that intensely was actually helping them in their other work,” she said, “helping them think more clearly as well.” Because of this, the dance process wasn’t simply a compilation of what was learned in the studio but rather a collection of snippets from each dancer’s lives as well—creating, again, a duality between their dance classes and their other classes.
According to the program, this dyad correlates strongly to one of the purposes of the show: to change people’s minds about dance and the way it is presented. “There isn’t a right or wrong [in dance],” Johnson says. “When you see something that’s so striking, there isn’t a sort of ‘getting it.’ You can’t explain it; you just experience it. That idea about changing minds is to open up the conversation. There is no right or wrong. It’s what you bring to the theater and what you experience.”
Ultimately, the various dualities the performance expresses is what challenges the audience to view dance and art in a different light than before. According to Johnson, rather than seeing a dance performance simply as a distant art, the show encourages the viewers to see it as something that dually intersects parts of their own lives as well. “I hope each person takes away a picture or a moment or something that elicited a thought or a breakthrough that is in a way a pause for thought in our super busy lives,” she says. “And maybe we even changed their minds about dance along the way.”

Sci-fi isn’t a highly regarded genre, and with good reason. I first came to grips with crappy science fiction when I was seven years old and wanted to watch “Stargate SG-1” on a Saturday afternoon. I had seen a commercial with lasers and spaceships and Michael Shanks squinting out from his big round ’90s glasses, and I was convinced that this was going to be the best thing I’d ever seen. My father humored me and we tuned in as the frenetic credits sequence started rolling.
The short story: I was wrong. It was not the best thing I had ever seen. I’m not sure my father and I even made it through the entire episode. I learned the important lesson that cool CGI and big guns don’t make something worth watching.
What early experience taught, later experience confirmed. The Star Trek franchise had the benefit of being generally better written and better acted than “Stargate,” but at the end of the day it provided little more than a self-righteous enactment of the now broken fantasies of Great Society-era America. “Babylon 5” was less didactic but more ridiculous. I knew that there was serious science fiction in literature—I’d read “A Canticle for Leibowitz” about five times before I was even in high school—but I had mostly given up on the idea of the well produced science fiction movie, considering “2001: A Space Odyssey” a singular fluke. Then I saw “Blade Runner” and doubled my collection.
Ridley Scott has had some hits, and he’s had some misses—I don’t think anyone has deliberately watched “G.I. Jane” since 1997—but “Blade Runner” is a masterpiece in a category of its own. Harrison Ford, then in his prime, is Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter who specializes in finding escaped replicants—genetically engineered robots who are human in all but their expiration date. The film is set in the Los Angeles of the future: grungy and smog-ridden, controlled by large domestic and foreign interests. This is not the bright IKEA-sleek future of “2001,” or even the alternating plastic garishness and urban decay of “A Clockwork Orange.” This is a future where everything is dark and dirty, and even at midday the sunlight is sick and yellow. In the financial uncertainty of the late 2000s, this looked a lot more like a real future.
“Blade Runner” shows Scott at the peak of his powers as a filmmaker. The careful use of beautifully detailed physical sets and props allows the limited special effects of the 1982 film industry to integrate almost seamlessly with the rest of the film, teaching a lesson that the modern masters of CGI could relearn: The cutting edge techniques of today are the claymation of tomorrow, and nothing can replace a real object in front of a camera. The camerawork itself is gorgeous. Few mainstream films show the same mastery of chiaroscuro that is found in “Blade Runner,” but perhaps the most distinctive feature of the movie is the restraint that Scott shows even as he’s being brilliant. In one scene, Deckard stands silhouetted in front of his apartment window after a fight. He drinks from a glass of water and a small ribbon of blood blooms from his lips into the clear liquid. This tiny detail, a mere drop of food dye, transforms the shot into what is arguably the most beautiful representation of a man drinking water ever made—but it doesn’t draw attention to itself. There is no close-up on the lips, no reaction from characters. It’s left to the viewer to see and to enjoy.
This stands in stark contrast to, for example, the work of Quentin Tarantino, who includes a similar detail in “Pulp Fiction” when John Travolta’s Vincent Vega shoots up. There’s the same backlit ribbon of blood in the clear liquid of the syringe, but Tarantino films it with an extreme close-up. He uses the camera to force viewers to see how clever he is; Scott, on the other hand, seems confident enough in himself and his audience to know that the viewers will notice it on their own.
Ours is an unsubtle era. Our metaphors are obvious and our allegories are simple; the good guys are very good, and the bad guys are inhuman. The noble poor live on garbage heaps and the evil wealthy live in luxury space ships and shoot guns at anyone who approaches them (as in Neill Blomkamp’s “Elysium”). The oppressed struggle from the filthy back of the train to the debauched front of the train (as in Bong Joon-ho’s “Snowpiercer”). All of our images are cartoons: Our action movies are soaked in blood, our romances are soaked in tears. In this ethos, “Blade Runner” holds a quiet majesty. It is a masterpiece that does not blow its own horn, and it is a masterpiece in a genre that doesn’t usually produce masterpieces. That’s why, no matter how many movies like “Prometheus” and “Exodus” Scott makes, he’ll always be one of my favorite directors. He elevated a schlock-driven genre to high art, and he did it without yelling about it at anybody.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is 7:01 p.m. on a Thursday evening, and members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra are still straggling into Sanders Theatre. A violin rests against a wooden row of seats as its player finishes up a last-minute phone call before taking her place onstage. The mass of cellos, harps, and other instruments form an outer wall of the semicircle of half-filled chairs. Federico Cortese, now in his sixth year as the orchestra’s director and as a senior lecturer in the Department of Music, paces on the stage and sings fragments from the HRO’s repertoire in his silky tenor. With each passing second, his walk becomes faster, and his body language becomes more tense. By the time that most of the members present are seated, tuned, and ready to play—around 7:07 p.m.—Cortese is visibly distressed.
“This is so disrespectful,” he says. His tone, while possessing the volume and authority of a strict leader, also has a high-pitched, mournful strain. This early April rehearsal is not the first time that Cortese has been frustrated by the tardiness and lack of attendance in his ranks. The next few minutes are hard to watch. Cortese, not willing to start the rehearsal until more members of the orchestra have assembled, sits in silence. The violinists fidget with their bows, and the woodwind players fiddle with their mouthpieces. After a few more sharp-edged words on the importance of taking HRO seriously, Cortese sighs and picks up his baton. As soon as the first, drawn-out strings of the iconic fourth-movement adagietto (symphony-speak for a slow piece more upbeat than the morose adagio) of Mahler’s Symphony No. 5 ring out, the potent anxiety in the room lifts. The orchestra, despite Cortese’s complaints, sounds remarkably in sync. “Strings—you need to ‘sing’ the line more,” he says, keeping them in check. The strings respond, crafting a subtly smoother tone. The rehearsal proceeds in a more mellow fashion, the turbulent beginning seemingly forgotten in the passion of music-making.
The bizarre juxtaposition of the group’s frustration and music is representative of the tug-of-war plaguing both Cortese and his players: the disparity between HRO’s staggering talent and the seeming necessity of many of its members—and the larger Harvard establishment—to treat the orchestra as secondary to other responsibilities. This is not to suggest that Cortese is a cheerleader trying to rile up an unenergized bunch; to the contrary, musicians in the group talk at length about their attempts to prioritize HRO amidst the chaos of Harvard life. While some find Cortese’s expectations daunting, they, like their conductor, fault macrocosmic cultural and administrative limitations rather than any lack of enthusiasm—the difficulties in grading of the course, the challenges of collaboration with other musical groups on campus, and the more universal logistical puzzles of running a successful orchestra. The passion with which Cortese and much of HRO continue to identify and to confront the factors holding them back, however, shows a rabid determination to figure out how best to harness the talent of group and make it a preeminent college ensemble.
It is the morning of the rehearsal, and Cortese is sniffing around his office in the basement of the Music building. “It smells like mold in here,” he says. The maestro, a graduate of Rome’s prestigious Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia and the conductor of the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras in addition to his duties at Harvard, is perplexed. “It doesn’t usually smell like this,” he says. The room perhaps does smell a bit musty, but Cortese’s emphatic, highly physical response indicates his attention to detail.
As soon as Cortese begins discussing his vision for the future of the HRO, he starts sketching out a longue durée view of the interrelation between the the academy and the orchestra. Cortese, who grew up in Rome, was first exposed to music as a member of a choir at the Vatican and credits the institution with influencing his propensity for injecting music history into his work. “That’s how I became familiar with the liturgy and all the beautiful things,” he says. He blames HRO’s difficulties in securing additional attention and resources from both the Harvard administration and student body on a long-standing cultural reality: “These old, wonderful Ivy League schools have imported an old European tradition where music was not an intellectual achievement….You can go back to Plato and Aristotle for that one....How do you change hundreds of years of history—models of teaching that are built on certain subjects excluding music.”
Cortese’s explanation for what he perceives as Harvard’s lackadaisical approach to its orchestra, which includes references to the quadrivium and the rise of the American West, is full of obscure and unexpected references. In other words, he makes it clear that he understands the gravity of attempting to make HRO more formalized in the academic structure of the school. “The point is to recognize—for very good reasons historically—art-making and music have not been part of what is valued as intellectually worthy, not just at Harvard, but at most universities,” he says.
While Cortese highlights grandiose forces of history in his explanation of HRO’s woes, he also focuses on the group’s own origins. Originally called the Pierian Sodality, the group was founded in 1808 as a relatively loose confederation of interested players. “Instead of going out and having drinks, these wonderful students played Brahms—Brahms instead of bridge,” Cortese says. “A model from 1810 is not going to work….You can’t say, ‘If you guys are in the mood, there’s a rehearsal on Monday!’”
Stella F. Chen ’15, a violinist who has played in HRO since her freshman year and plans on pursuing the instrument as her career, sees a certain amount of value in the recreational aspects of the orchestra. “People are drawn to HRO because of the music, of course, but also because its a welcoming social space,” she says. Chen, who works extensively with Cortese in both formal classes and the orchestra, applauds his efforts. At the same time, however, Chen acknowledges that, if HRO becomes too stratified in its audition process and participation, a cut-throat culture may emerge.
Both Chen and Cortese also cite James Yannatos, the late music professor who oversaw the group for 45 years, as both a legendary force and a leader whose ideology towards the group differed from their own. “People tell me that the level of HRO shot up when Fed [Cortese] arrived,” Chen says. “Everyone loved [Yannatos] but he wasn’t as invested in making it as good of a musical experience…Cortese wants it to be the best that it can be.”
“If we decide that the faculty/conductor model is what we want to have, we have to push it all the way and make these groups rigorous, selective, and evaluated on stringent and strict criteria,” Cortese says. “Hence, grades.”  Cortese officially broke from the extracurricular model when he introduced grades for the 2013-2014 academic year. During this time, Cortese desperately attempted to evaluate 85 orchestra members individually through letter grades. Exhausted, the maestro compromised this year with a Pass/Fail system. In the present arrangement, Cortese tries to have a one-on-one audition for each student each semester and tracks attendance carefully. If the players do poorly at the audition, they are called back for another try. If results are still unsatisfactory failing the students, particularly if they have missed substantial rehearsal time, isn’t out of the question. Despite the more regulated evaluation method, Cortese claims to be running out of steam. As a result, he reached out for help to the Parker Quartet, the Blodgett Artists-in-Residence in the Music Department, who oversaw a number of the evaluations. Even with the assistance, however, assessing the sheer number of auditions is a staggering task.
The particulars of Cortese’s overall plan for the orchestra are slightly more nebulous than his hopes for grading. In broad terms, he explains that his plan centers around securing teaching fellows, more funding, and safeguards to ensure that those who submitted classical music supplements—recordings and essays that college applicants can submit to Harvard’s music department—are encouraged, or perhaps even required, to play in the orchestra for a year. To that end, Cortese says that he hopes the group will flourish under his direction. “We want Harvard to have the best liberal arts orchestra in the country,” he says.
Upping the intensity has garnered mixed results, according to some musicians. Chen argued that making the orchestra more rigorous could scare away talented musicians who are looking for a more casual musical experience. In practice, however, Chen said that she saw mostly positive results of increased rigor for the graded orchestra. “There were several people who dropped out...but from my perspective overall attendance improved, which made the orchestra sound better.” Chen, however, sounds cautious in her endorsement of letter grades. “It’s hard to look at something as both your main extracurricular, ‘friend group’ thing and also something that you’re receiving a grade for.”
Alex R. Orlov ’16, a bassoonist in HRO, echoed the sentiments of the other four current and former HRO members who were interviewed in his mixed feelings about Cortese’s hope to eventually reinstate the letter grades. “I hope that it doesn’t push people to see the orchestra as an onerous commitment, because overall, at least for me, it still has the same feel of being...a welcome break from the other stuff that I’m doing.” Orlov, who studies applied mathematics, says that he was very thankful that the good grade he received in HRO last year went on his transcript. He does echo some of Chen’s concerns, however, that his exceptional level of experience with his instrument helps him succeed grade-wise in ways that don’t have to do with his inherent effort. “I barely ever practice anymore, but I get by,” he says. Further, while Orlov is on board with Cortese’s vision of improving the group, he also thinks that both the maestro and his players don’t always recognize how talented they are already. “Hearing the quality of HRO actually heavily influenced me towards going to Harvard,” he says, before going on to compare the group favorably to those at other Ivy League institutions. In Orlov’s view, while grades may be helpful, they aren’t crucial.
Cortese believes increasing the competitive quality of the orchestra may draw more talented students to the group, but this same selectivity is already one of the reasons that musicians look to perform elsewhere. Jiha Min ’18, for example, is a member of the Harvard Pops Orchestra, a multidisciplinary group conducted by Allen G. Feinstein ’86 that combines a classical repertoire with student-written pieces, contemporary popular music, and theatrical elements. Once accepted to Harvard, Min, a violinist, says that she narrowed down her musical choices to HRO, the Bach Society Orchestra, and the Pops Orchestra. While Min credits a desire to play unfamiliar genres as a factor in her decision to join the Pops, she also acknowledges the difficulty and time commitment of playing in HRO. “Pops is two and half hours a week and HRO is five,” she says. “I’ve played violin for 13 years, but I want to keep it up in the fun, more relaxed environment Pops offers me rather than trying out for HRO.”
In addition to smaller groups like the Pops, the joint degree program between Harvard and the New England Conservatory of Music also offer paths for Harvard’s musicians who do not want to join HRO. The Harvard-NEC program, in which students take private lessons and music classes at the Conservatory, including an intensive fifth year post-Harvard in which they fulfill many of their more academic requirements, attracts mostly musicians who hope to play professionally. Chen, who is in the joint program in addition to her work in the orchestra, has had a hard time balancing the two commitments. “The first year I hardly practiced before 2 a.m.,” she says.
Chen does not believe that her vigorous schedule is inherently unmanageable, however. “It seems like a lot of the kids are doing much better than I [do] now,” she says. “There are more of them, and they lean on each other.”
Orlov offers several character sketches of maestro Cortese. “We lovingly call him a diva,” Orlov says, reminiscing about some of Cortese’s memorable frustrations. Based on all of Cortese’s criticisms of departmental resource allocation, it wouldn’t be surprising if Music Department chair Carol J. Oja was less than thrilled by Cortese’s demands. Instead, however, Oja says that she is extremely grateful for Cortese’s presence, genuineness, and ability to work well with young people.
Oja also says that she recognizes the importance of making the HRO accessible to those with fewer skills or without intentions for a career in music.  “I don’t think we have the perfect solution, but we are trying, with all the good will in the world, to find a solution that will yield the kind of artistic responsibility that Fed is aiming for from the students...that will still maintain the spirit of the HRO and leave room for students of all sorts to be in there,” she says. “There’s a lot of collaboration figuring out what the next step will be.”
The transition of the HRO from an extracurricular activity to an orchestral class is one cliffhanger in the intensifying relationship between Harvard and the arts. “Harvard has been an institution that has a lot of performance but hasn’t honored it in a curricular way,” Oja says. “We are trying to move to a new stage.” Six days ago, in a huge move towards making art curricular, faculty representatives officially approved the long-planned Theater, Dance, and Media concentration. Cortese and the HRO are in the process of jumping into this new platform of academic art-making, but their passion in this moment of change suggests that they, and those looking to integrate art and academics at large, won’t stop until they get there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Cuban embargo was imposed, Barack Obama was not yet alive. It was 1960, four years before the British Invasion and with the construction of Mather House still 11 years off. Today, of course, Mr. Obama sits in the Oval Office, the Beatles have ascended into music history, and Mather has successfully taken its place on the beautiful neo-Georgian skyline of Cambridge—and yet we are still saddled with the Cuban embargo.
It should be clear that the embargo has failed. When it was imposed, there were hopes that economic sanctions might persuade the new revolutionary government to pursue democracy and capitalism. It is clear now that this was a pipe dream. Fidel Castro today is sickly and ill, but Cuba is no closer to democracy than when he was a charismatic young revolutionary. Indeed, his regime benefits from anti-American domestic sentiment that bolsters its popularity and distracts from the nation’s economic woes. Any national security rationale for American policy toward Cuba has evaporated. Despite its inclusion on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, in reality the only threat to America posed by the Castro regime is the ill will generated by the embargo elsewhere in Latin America.
If liberal, free market democracy is the goal, then President Obama’s new direction on Cuba is long overdue. American policy has long since discovered that the answer to undemocratic but unthreatening regimes in our post-Cold War world is engagement, dialogue, and trade, not sanctions, isolation, and hostility. The world’s largest communist country is one of our largest trading partners. The world’s largest absolute monarchy is a major oil supplier. Just as Levi jeans and Coca-Cola helped bring down the Berlin Wall, iPhones and Starbucks lattes might help bring about change in Cuba.
It is certainly the case that Cuba’s human rights record is decidedly mixed. So too, however, are the human rights records of China, Saudi Arabia, and countless other nations, and yet we maintain economic and political relationships with them. Of course, Cuba's geopolitical significance might be less than the aforementioned countries, but the principle remains identical. We should continue to press for democracy worldwide, and President Obama has made clear that the United States will do so in Cuba, but that should not be an obstacle to normalized relations.
The Cold War is now for the history books, and policies of containment should follow. There are no dominos falling to communism across the Caribbean, and describing Cuba today, like the State Department does, as a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” alongside nations like Syria does not seem credible. One is murdering its citizens with sarin gas; the other is trying to keep 1950s Cadillacs running. As the President continues to press the Castro regime on its human rights abuses, we commend him for his courage in reshaping the relationship with Cuba. 55 years on, it is the right thing to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’ve all heard the statistics: Nearly half of first marriages end in divorce, women tend to be less happy in their marriages than men, bad marriages lead to heart disease, and more. In fact, we’ve become so familiar with this scientific discourse that it seems these statistics have led to another: According to the Pew Research Center, 25 percent of millennials will "never get married."
Although I’m skeptical to believe every “new study” I hear about the status of modern relationships, this one seems to be strikingly reflected in my own peer circles. Now more than ever, I hear friends happily discussing their rejection of marriage, and even poking fun at it through “group marriage” themed parties.
Lately this paradigm shift in relationships has me questioning my own views: Perhaps believing in an institution that is trending toward the obsolete is foolish. After all, most of us are well aware that marriage can be a patriarchal institution intent on reinforcing and reaffirming certain backwards gender stereotypes. It is also an inherently exclusionary tradition that prohibits many loving couples from gaining certain legal protections and benefits. But if the Pew Research statistic is correct, 75 percent of millennials still intend on participating in this tradition. Despite all the controversy surrounding marriage, it seems we still value it as an institution.
There are many explanations for why this may be. Part of it is historical—marriage is a time-honored tradition of affirming a romantic relationship. Part of it is political—marriage accords a legal legitimacy to a relationship that allows for numerous social and financial benefits. And yet another part of it is religious or cultural. But what if we were to wash away all of these associations? What would be left? Or, more importantly, would there be anything left worth saving?
I’d argue yes for a few important reasons. First, life boils down to a series of decisions. If you’re monogamous, or believe in monogamy, at some point that decision becomes, “Do I want to commit myself fully to someone else?” Marriage is one of the many ways to affirm that commitment. Even more than that, marriage implies the permanency of that commitment in the face of struggle or hardship. For married couples, an exit clause is still available in the form of divorce, but the exit sign isn’t always flashing a bright green in their faces, giving them an easy out.
Of course, there are other ways to remain committed to your partner, and even within marriage there can be a lack of commitment. But marriage means more than simply binding yourself to another human being. It also means affirming your love and devotion to one another in front of the people who mean the most to you. It means having the courage to stand up in front of your friends and family and exchange promises for the future, promises that hold you accountable for your actions.
These kinds of promises can also condition us to think less selfishly through what psychologists call a “transformation of motivation.” Although this is also the case in long-term relationships, marriage provides a fast track to thinking in terms of “us” as opposed to “me.” In this way, marriage is admittedly performative—by exchanging certain vows, we create a notion of our spouse as family—but it’s a performativity that’s helpful in establishing a loving commitment between human beings.
This is not to say that marriage is for everyone—many of the advantages of matrimony can be acquired through other forms of romantic relationships. Nevertheless, I am still inclined to believe that there’s value in marriage beyond any of the social or financial benefits it offers. Unlike some of my peers, I look forward to the day when I can stand before my family and friends and say, “This is the person I choose. I could have chosen someone else, I could have chosen not to get married at all, but I’m pledging myself to this person for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part.” To me, that’s accountability. That’s dedication. That’s commitment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s talk about the so-called social justice warrior. But first, let’s talk about his or her counterpoint: the hashtag activist. Because blaming the social justice warrior for the supposed alienation of “unabashed liberals” is both misguided and disingenuous.
The hashtag activist is familiar to everyone. He or she posts Facebook statuses that decry various social injustices. He or she will comment on their friends’ statuses using similar methods. And you know the rest. The age of unlimited and unfiltered expression through social media has produced these hashtag activists, the newest, 21st century version of the armchair activist.
There is nothing inherently wrong with hashtag activism. If you can spread awareness for causes (at least, causes that need awareness-spreading), then you are performing a valuable service. The danger of hashtag activism is that it often takes the place of real activism.
Hashtag activism, for many 21st century, social justice-inclined individuals, is a comforting blanket with which to wrap oneself. “I am aware that these problems exist and I am doing my part to try to solve these problems,” they say to themselves. I know this because I am sometimes guilty of this offense.
The social justice warrior, or at least the so-called “radical” social justice warrior, is usually the opposite of the hashtag activist. Of course, there are individuals who are both social justice warriors and hashtag activists. But, for the purpose of our discussion, let’s focus on the “radical”—I use quotes so we know that we’re talking about Harvard’s version of radicalism—social justice warriors, the organizers of the Primal Scream protest and the Divest protesters outside President Faust’s office.
To some, these social justice warriors are the real problem with liberal or leftist activism these days. But criticism of these social justice warriors is often little more than an excuse for inaction.
But this is a grievous misdiagnosis of the problem. Instead, these protesters are making a very clear statement against the very thing that their critics are secretly trying to justify: the apathy of our generation. This apathy is merely cloaked as disillusionment with new liberal activism.
Rather than a “near-constant assumption of bad faith,” these social justice warriors are trying to fight against both injustice and indifference all at the same time. It is thus easy to see why these social justice warriors resort to “radical” tactics. But let’s not diagnose them as the problem, or the reason why “rational” liberals are being turned off to activism and social justice causes. The so-called “rational” liberal is being turned off to activism because he can comfort himself with hashtag activism in place of real activism. And hashtag activism is generally a very poor substitute.
And let’s be clear: I’ll be the first to admit that social justice warriors are not always right about their tactics. Was the primal scream protest completely justified and appropriate form of activism? No, probably not. But the real problem in the world of liberal activism is not misguided tactics, it’s no tactics at all. Social justice warriors are not the ones “losing unabashed liberals”; unabashed liberals are losing themselves with their unwillingness to leave their comfort zones. And that’s really what it’s about here: comfort. It’s more comfortable to talk about activism than it is to act. And it’s more comfortable to criticize a protest than it is to organize a protest of your own.
If we need to have a discussion about tactics, then let’s have that discussion. But let’s have that discussion by putting forth the kind of activism that we want to see. If you think that Christine Lagarde should absolutely be allowed to speak at Smith College (and I would agree with you 100 percent), then fight for her right to do so. If you think that the Primal Scream protest was inappropriate because many of those who were participating had impaired judgment due to alcohol consumption, then, again, voice that concern. But after voicing that concern, get up from the armchair and help organize the next protest, the one that does things the right way.
To a hammer, everything looks a nail, and to the hashtag activist, real activism is scary and uncomfortable.
But let’s be honest with ourselves: social justice warriors are not the reason that social justice causes are “losing unabashed liberals.” The time, effort, and discomfort that are required for proper activism is what’s losing unabashed liberals. So let’s get back to the arguments and debates about ideology and tactics that matter and stop criticizing those that have the courage and audacity to act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 14, 2015, at 1:02 a.m. 
Environmental activist group Divest Harvard continued its planned blockade of Massachusetts Hall on Monday and expanded its demonstration to the Harvard Alumni Association, where 12 University alumni planned to stay overnight in protest of Harvard’s investment in the fossil fuel industry.
The second day of the planned weeklong protest, which organizers have dubbed “Harvard Heat Week,” followed a dramatic launch on Sunday night that involved a rally that drew at least 150 people who joined to blockade Harvard’s central administrative building.
A smaller group of protesters, including many undergraduates, camped out overnight through Monday morning, when they awoke to start the demonstration’s next day, which was punctuated by alumni rallies outside Mass. Hall and expansion to other parts of campus.
Protesters began their day early. Students who were blockading stirred from their sleep starting at around 6 a.m. Monday morning, rolling up their sleeping bags and readying themselves for another day blocking entrances to Mass. Hall. Eating cold pizza and reading lines from “Civil Disobedience in America: A Documentary History” by David R. Weber, the protesters spent the early morning decorating the building they blockaded with signs and banners reading, “Stand on the right side of history” and “Harvard Heat Week.”
At about 10 a.m., alumni rallied outside Mass. Hall to hear speeches about climate change from prominent alumni, including Bill E. McKibben ’82, the leader of the environmental group 350.org and a former Crimson president, and former Colorado Senator Timothy E. Wirth ’61.
Throughout the day, protesters guarded the doors to Mass. Hall. No Mass. Hall administrators or staff members entered the building on Monday, according to Divest Harvard co-coordinator Talia K. Rothstein ’17. According to University spokesperson Jeff Neal, administrators relocated.
“In view of the group's having barred entry to Mass Hall, folks who normally work there are finding other places to work,” Neal wrote in a statement. University President Drew G. Faust, whose office is in Mass. Hall, has repeatedly argued against divestment and held a panel on Monday in which she discussed the importance of using research to combat climate change.
Early Monday afternoon, supporters of Divest Harvard expanded the demonstration in protest of Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies and gathered in the offices of the Harvard Alumni Association on Mt. Auburn Street. Once there, alumni signed pledge cards for a fossil-free fund, an alternative to donating to the University’s endowment, that stipulates Harvard will only receive donations if it divests. They delivered about 50 pledge cards with such donations of up to $5,000 to Shannon Gerah, the human resources director for Alumni Affairs and Development.
After delivering the pledge cards, demonstrators demanded a meeting with the organization’s leaders to talk about divestment, according to McKibben, who was still inside the office at about 7:30 p.m. Monday. When HAA did not agree to a meeting, according to McKibben, the group continued to protest in the office and refused to leave at the close of business hours.
“They write us numerous times each year asking us for stuff, so we thought it would be okay to ask for a meeting,” McKibben said in an interview over the phone from HAA’s offices.
Nine alumni protesters planned to stay overnight in the office, while another three planned to sleep in a hallway between the elevator and the office. According to McKibben, the office was blocked by Harvard Police, preventing the three in the hallway to join their fellow protesters. Despite the barrier, McKibben said the protesters’ interactions with the police have been “very friendly”; they spent the evening discussing the Red Sox opener, he said.
The day culminated in a nighttime vigil outside Mass. Hall led by Divest Harvard alumni coordinator Benjamin A. Franta, before protesters prepared to sleep outside the building overnight again.
Protesters ranging from Harvard students to alumni participated throughout the day. During the alumni rally, Susan Ringler ’74, a Cambridge resident who said she divested her personal portfolio five years ago, said Divest Harvard “specifically chose a very symbolic thing that would actually not disrupt the important work that many thousands of people do at Harvard.”
“Harvard has a really important place as a beacon,” she added. “When Harvard does something, people listen.”
Still, not all protesters present Monday advocated for divestment. In the early afternoon, Daniel E. Golliher ’14 held a sign reading “Don’t Divest.”
“I'm here because I think fossil fuels are a moral good," he said, referencing philosopher of energy Alex Epstein.
Divest Harvard has said it will blockade Mass. Hall until Friday, April 17. This planned protest follows other smaller-scale demonstrations by the group. Late last spring, students—including an undergraduate who was arrested but not charged—blockaded Mass. Hall in a similar protest, and this February, Divest Harvard staged a 24-hour occupation of the building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 14, 2015, at 1:29 a.m.
After six years as dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, Julio Frenk will leave Harvard to serve as president of the University of Miami.
In the midst of Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, Frenk oversaw the School of Public Health when it secured the largest gift in the University’s history—a $350 million gift that led to the school’s renaming in honor of the father of donor and billionaire Gerald L. Chan.
Frenk will assume Miami’s presidency on Sept. 1, according to a University of Miami press release.
Before serving as the School of Public Health’s dean at Harvard, Frenk served as Mexico’s minister of health from 2000 to 2006, introducing the government-funded universal healthcare program Seguro Popular. He also worked as an executive director for the World Health Organization and as a senior fellow at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.
“I have known Dr. Frenk for more than two decades,” said Donna E. Shalala, current University of Miami president, in the press release. “He is an extraordinary, highly respected leader in global public health. I warmly welcome him and his family to the university and our community.”
University President Drew G. Faust thanked Frenk for his service in a statement. “It’s clear from their choice that the University of Miami’s trustees share Julio’s own qualities of wisdom and foresight, and that they have discovered in him the remarkable leadership capacity and vision with which he has graced Harvard these past six years,” she said in the statement.
Frenk earned his M.D. from the National Autonomous University of Mexico before earning a Ph.D. and Master of Public Health degree at the University of Michigan. His appointment to dean of the School of Public Health in 2008 made him one of two deans at Harvard at the time to hail from a country outside of the United States. His projects at Harvard have included raising awareness of maternal health, advocating for increased global health security, and promoting healthcare investment in developing countries, and his work both in and out of Harvard has earned him various accolades.
Mitchell L. Dong ’75, a member of the Executive Committee on the School of Public Health’s Leadership Council, attested to Frenk’s singular approach and experience in global health.
“We can study, we can research, we can make science, but unless it actually affects and improves human lives, what good is it?” Dong said. “[Julio] is a perfect model of that. People look up to somebody who’s not just studied it and consulted upon it and written about it, but somebody who’s done it. He did it.”
Katherine S. Burke ’79, a member of the School of Public Health’s Capital Campaign committee and former Crimson editor, also noted Frenk’s transformative impact.
“He’s someone who can take on some of the world’s most challenging problems, problems that seem overwhelming,” Burke said. “Yet he inspires people and leaves people with a source of hope and optimism for what can be accomplished. When you look at problems in AIDS, ebola, and healthcare inequities, to have someone who can lead the way forward and inspire people…that’s a great gift.”
Though Frenk’s departure from Harvard marks the end of his official involvement in HSPH’s fundraising efforts, Burke expressed confidence in the strength of the campaign in Frenk’s absence.
“Julio is an extremely inspiring leader, and of course he will be greatly missed in the capital campaign,” Burke said. “However, I think he’s already done an extraordinary job in inspiring not only the Chan family but also the School of Public Health and University to take a look at the incredible work the school is doing.”
Richard L. Menschel, who supported a $12.5 million gift to the School of Public Health in September 2013, praised the University of Miami’s choice. “[HSPH] has benefited from the dean's international outlook, creative and respected leadership and his ability to implement his ideas and vision,” he wrote in an emailed statement.

The team behind the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ new student information system—the new my.harvard.edu—aims to hire 15 to 20 undergraduates to learn the “ins and outs” of the system before it is implemented over the summer, according to Jason C. Shaffner ’99, managing director for student information systems.
The undergraduates hired as “ambassadors” will undergo training to learn the new website's features and then can work remotely throughout the summer, according to Shaffner. They will serve as tech assistants by helping students use the system and sending emails to their Houses throughout the year.
In addition, the "ambassadors" will act as the liaisons between the Student Information Systems office and the greater undergraduate community, according to Juliana DiLuca, HUIT communications and marketing specialist.
“This group [will act] as our core group,” DiLuca said. “They will have the finger on the pulse of what’s going on.”
Undergraduates, regardless of their computer science background, can apply for the position, and twenty students already have done so, Shaffner said.
“It’s not really a CS-type thing,” Shaffner said. “We want to make sure we have students [who study] the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences [involved].”
The new student information system, which will be rolled out in FAS and the Divinity School in the fall, will make electronic the process for completing study cards, obtaining required signatures from advisers and professors, and submitting add/drop course forms. Sophomores also will complete their declaration of concentration forms online through the system.
In addition to housing those documents online, the new my.harvard will feature a degree progress report, according to Shaffner.
“Imagine a report that tells you at a glance [about degree requirements and General Education courses to be completed],” Shaffner said. “It really should be easy to use. Harvard’s got a lot of degrees; basically, we’re turning the 48 Guide into something logical.”
The new student information system also will have a course search function with a “Google-like interface,” Shaffner said. Students will be able to use filters to search for courses by department or by Gen Ed, for example.
“My staff, working with HUIT [Harvard University Information Technology], have been building next year’s course catalog,” FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said, adding that “Behind the scenes, we are using the new student [information] system... It’s looking great."
“It looks modern, it looks helpful, it looks intuitive,” Burke said. “We won’t need a training course on helping people how to use it, because it’s going to be pretty darn obvious.”

The Undergraduate Council’s Student Initiatives Committee has named three finalists from the original 15 proposals submitted to its "Harvard Project" grant initiative.
The Harvard Project, which was first discussed by the Council at a previous general meeting on March 23, aims to reward student initiatives that fulfill the Council’s broader goals of sustainability, inclusivity, and student health. The winning proposal chosen from the three finalists, which were named at the Council's general meeting on Sunday, will receive $3,000 to help with execution of the proposed initiative.
According to Student Initiatives Committee Chair Daniel V. Banks ’17, the three winning proposals include energy-saving drying racks in residential laundry rooms, a pre-orientation program for freshmen from under-resourced high schools, and funding for Renegade, a new student-run arts and advocacy magazine.
The pre-orientation program, called the Freshman Enrichment Program, would offer students both upperclassmen and post-graduate mentors, a dinner series, and a discussion network geared toward students matriculating to Harvard from under-resourced high schools.
According to its sponsor, Savannah N. Fritz ’17, the First Generation Student Union and the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid have both made major strides to “catch up to the reality of the student body” by providing ample financial aid and resources to students from less privileged backgrounds. However, Fritz said she feels that Harvard would benefit further from an initiative like the Freshman Enrichment Program.
Princeton and Yale currently have respective six-week-long and five-week-long enrichment programs for incoming freshmen from under-resourced high schools.
Another initiative, called AirDry, aims to encourage campus-wide sustainability by reducing the amount of energy that electric clothing dryers use. Dhruv A. Pillai ’17, who submitted the proposal for the initiative, argued that Harvard’s dryers are “energy sinks.”
Lastly, Jenny A. Gathright ’16 sponsored a proposal seeking funding for Renegade, an advocacy magazine that launched about two weeks ago. Renegade is a venue for student artists and students of color to come together and showcase writing and artwork, said Gathright, a former Crimson editorial writer.
“Through creativity and collaboration, we empower individual voices and minds and place our expression at the center of campus discourse,” she said.
According to the UC’s website, an innovation fair and voting period will be held for the three finalists from Wednesday until Friday.

University President Drew G. Faust did not address Divest Harvard’s ongoing blockade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses her office, when she introduced a panel discussion on climate change on Monday. After Faust introduced the panel, the group of seven climate change experts and talk show host Charlie Rose, who moderated the discussion, covered topics ranging from national energy policy to divestment at Harvard.
After an hour of moderated discourse in Sanders Theatre, Rose—a popular television personality—opened up questions to the crowd.
The conversation between experts comes as members of Divest Harvard blockade Mass. Hall to protest Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies. Protesters plan to block all three entrances to Mass. Hall, the University's central administrative building, for the rest of week. Another set of protesters planned to stay Monday night at the Harvard Alumni Association.
President Faust made no mention of either occurrence.
“Universities have a crucial role to play,” Faust said at the beginning of the climate change panel. “We act through our research, our educational programs, our embrace of sustainability on campus, our engagement with the wider world. What medium we choose depends critically on how we engage with others. ”
Faust has long said that Harvard should not divest from fossil fuels, though she did not discuss the issue at Monday’s event.
Some professors said they have advocated for an open discussion to engage with Faust on the issue of divestment at Harvard.  James M. Recht, an assistant professor at the Medical School, and Bruce L. Hay, a Law School professor, said they were disappointed that that Monday’s event did not address that request.
The panel, on the other hand, did address the topic of divestment, and different members debated how the University should engage the question of divesting the endowment from fossil fuels.
“I don’t see how we can have the conversation we’re having here and still continue to invest in companies that are building more fossil fuel infrastructure,” said Naomi Oreskes, a History of Science professor and a member of Harvard Faculty for Divestment. Her comments were met with applause from the crowd.
But the panel was not united on the issue. For her part, Rebecca M. Henderson, a University professor, said that, while she supports divesting from the coal industry, she does not think divesting from all fossil fuels is an effective approach to the broader problem of climate change.
“The reason I’m so nervous about [divesting from] all fossil fuels is...all fossil fuels companies aren’t the same,” Henderson said. She later added, “I fear that making a decision that would be seen as very political might hurt the long-term standing of the University.”
In addition to Henderson and Oreskes, the other panelists included: Joseph E. Aldy, an assistant professor at the Kennedy School and former White House energy staffer, Christopher B. Field ’75, a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and a Stanford professor, John P. Holdren, a White House energy adviser, Richard G. Newell, a Duke professor, and Daniel P. Schrag, a Harvard geology professor.

The student group Native Americans at Harvard College hosted the 10th annual Ivy Native Conference last weekend, bringing more than 110 students from all eight Ivy League schools to Cambridge to highlight issues in the Native American community and network among each other.
Taking place from Friday to Sunday, the conference consisted of socials, panel events, and keynote addresses all focusing around the conference’s theme of “Economic Vibrancy in 21st Century Native Communities.” According to Caden T. Chase ’17, vice president of the NAHC, the focus on economics was unique from past years’ conferences, which had themes related to arts or music.
“We thought it would be more important to spotlight the different economic paths that people have taken to ensure the survival of their people both culturally and physically,” he said.
After a morning address by Philip J. Deloria, a visiting professor in the History Department who specializes in Native American history, the conference included a career fair, followed by a panel discussion Saturday afternoon. The panel featured individuals in the consulting industry as well as Jessica R. Metcalfe, owner of what she said is the first Native American-operated online gallery store specializing in Native American-made fashion.
Jack Martin, a sophomore at Brown who attended the conference, said the panel discussion was important for showing how traditional Native values can be integrated with the current economic system.
“We can integrate cultural values and engage in the strongly capitalistic structure of the U.S.,” Martin said. “We can use our traditional values to empower not just ourselves but the ways we can make money and...get funding and resources that will help our communities.”
Valentina S. Rodriguez ’15, president of the NAHC, said part of the motivation of the conference was not just to bring together Native American students, but to raise awareness about Native issues for the larger student body.
“There’s often a little bit of mystery about what it means to be Native today and what it means to be a Native at an Ivy League school,” she said. “It’s really important to have places where these things can be discussed.”
The All-Ivy Native Council is a student-run organization that brings together all eight Ivies’ Native student groups. Hosted at Harvard this year, the Ivy Native Conference not only had attendants from the Native student groups of the eight Ivy League schools, but also from McGill, University of Notre Dame, MIT, and George Washington University, according to Rodriguez.

Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin M. Rudd urged the U.S. and Chinese governments to develop a common strategic narrative to improve their relations during a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum panel at the Institute of Politics on Monday night.
Titled “U.S.-China Under Xi Jinping: From Strategic Collision to Common Purpose?," the event was moderated by Kennedy School of Government professor Graham T. Allison and also featured Kennedy School professors Anthony J. Saich and Meghan L. O’Sullivan. Saich and O’Sullivan critiqued Rudd’s forthcoming report “U.S.-China 21: The Future of U.S.-China Relations Under Xi Jinping.”
In the executive summary of his forthcoming report, Rudd emphasized the importance that China and the U.S. avoid the “Thucydides Trap,” a theory proposed by Allison that purports that when a rising power emerges in international relations, fear drives the established power to war. Although Rudd insisted during the panel that the U.S. and China are currently at very low risk of military conflict, the underlying framework behind U.S.-China relations can be significantly improved.
“There is a grave danger that the two countries will drift apart and a long-term crisis or conflict will emerge. There are ways to minimize the chance of that happening,” he said.
Consequently, Rudd said he proposes regular, annual summits in which the leaders of both countries meet to discuss common goals and identify areas in which they can cooperate.
“The idea behind a regular, working summit is that if you do enough on the constructive side, it will build up strategic trust,” he said.
Saich, for his part, said China has historically not been successful in maintaining bilateral relationships.
Although O’Sullivan generally lauded Rudd’s report, she did take issue with several aspects of it. She said one piece of Rudd’s analysis with which she took issue was China’s willingness to take on a superpower role in solving global crises.
“Where I have my skepticism is to what extent is China interested in being a steward of the global order and in the sort of role that the U.S. takes as a global problem solver,” she said. “China’s view as a global order seems to be instrumental, in that China is interested in global order when it helps its own interests.”
Rudd, in response, warned against reaching the conclusion that China will only act in its own interest in the global arena.
“If we reach that hard and fast conclusion, that’s how it will turn out,” Rudd said.

Amid a weeklong protest by environmental activist group Divest Harvard, at least 18 members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment intend to devote portions of their course meetings this week to the topic of climate change and divestment.
A few faculty members—including Medical School assistant professor James M. Recht, English professor Nicholas J. Watson, and Law School professor Bruce Hay—passed out flyers to passersby Monday morning just steps away from a blockade around Massachusetts Hall, which houses offices of top Harvard officials including University President Drew G. Faust. Divest Harvard has stationed members outside of Mass. Hall entrances since Sunday night.
Later in the afternoon, after attending a panel on climate change introduced by Faust, Recht and Hay returned to Mass. Hall to hold a debriefing about the panel with students and alumni, many of whom expressed disappointment at the content of Faust’s remarks.
The faculty group, which is composed of about 250 faculty members from across the University’s schools who have signed an open letter urging Harvard to withdraw its investments in fossil fuel companies, does not have an official stance on Divest Harvard’s blockade, according to Recht. But many faculty in the group have expressed support for what they call Divest Havard’s persistence in continuing the discussion on divestment.
“We are out there supporting the students. We think their mission is critical,” Recht said, though adding that the group “is not prepared” to publicly agree on the efficacy of any specific tactic used by Divest Harvard.
Watson said he supported the weeklong protest, dubbed “Harvard Heat Week” by organizers, and will participate in teach-ins, but that he did not have any specific stance on its blockade strategy.
According to the Faculty for Divestment website, at least 18 faculty will dedicate all or a portion of one of their classes this week to discussing divestment and climate change with their students in what the group is calling their “Heat Week” teach-ins.
History of Science lecturer Soha Bayoumi said she plans to speak to her students “briefly about the ‘Heat Week’ and about why those students and faculty are doing what they are doing, and why they are engaged.”
“That's the purpose behind the teach-in, to assuage concerns or fears some students may have especially about the notion of movement, and also talk to them about the question of climate change,” Bayoumi said.
Hay plans to hold an additional class session for students in his Extension School course LSTU E-160: "Art and the Law” to talk exclusively about issues of divestment and climate change. Watson expects to connect themes from his course, Culture and Belief 51: "Making the Middle Ages,” to contemporary issues of climate change.
Faculty for Divestment will host its own open forum specifically focused on divestment Friday afternoon.

Harvard alumni working to bring a student-run youth homeless shelter to Harvard Square celebrated their progress on the project on Monday at a launch event outside the First Parish in Cambridge—the Unitarian Universalist church that will house the shelter when it is slated to open in November.
The youth homeless shelter—which will be run by Y2Y Harvard Square, the initiative previously called the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter’s Youth Housing Initiative—will be located in the basement of the First Parish, whose congregation approved the collaboration late last month. It will operate alongside a daytime drop-in center for homeless youth called Youth on Fire.
At the launch event Monday, Y2Y Harvard Square co-directors Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 unveiled designs of the shelter, which is scheduled to open on Nov. 1 and hold 20 beds. Organizers have raised 75 percent—more than $950,000—of their $1.25 million funding goal, according to a press release. A 15-year contract with the Cambridge Housing Authority for more than $50,000 in annual funding will cover more than 50 percent of the shelter’s operating budget.
At the launch event, speakers emphasized the importance of providing shelter to homeless youth in Cambridge, and specifically LGBTQ-identified youth.
“Our peers are aging out of foster care without adequate support; they are being kicked out of their homes for who they love or who they are, and they are fleeing unsafe or unsupportive environments,” Rosenkrantz said in her speech at the launch. “For so many of our peers, home is a park bench, a sidewalk, or an unsafe adult shelter.”
Speaker Jamila Bradley, 22, who identified herself as a queer black female, provided the perspective of a former homeless young person at the launch event. Other speakers included Cambridge City Councillor Marc C. McGovern, and Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, among others.
Following a press conference, organizers celebrated with a reception at Phillips Brooks House.
Isabelle Yang ’17, Y2Y’s data director, referenced the large proportion of the homeless youth population that identifies as LGBTQ and the lack of available beds for homeless young adults in an interview at the reception. “I could not live with myself knowing I had such a close connection to all those issues and the cause and not doing anything about it,” she said.
Yang said she will be responsible for collecting data, using it to evaluate the effectiveness of the shelter, and providing “continuous conversation between the guests, us, and the numbers,” when the shelter launches. She will serve one shift each week supervising the shelter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Documentarian Stanley E. Nelson Jr. shared his motivations for becoming a filmmaker and discussed themes recurring throughout his movies in a conversation with University President Drew G. Faust on Monday at the 2015 Noble Lecture held at Memorial Church.
With Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton moderating, Faust focused on Nelson’s documentaries that had been screened in the months leading up to his visit as a part of the Noble Lecture Film Series: Freedom Summer, Freedom Riders, and Wounded Knee: We Shall Remain. The event also consisted of a question-and-answer session with the audience and the screening of short segments of his films.
Faust asked Nelson about his rationale for using the testimony of 12-year-old Janie Miller, who provided water for the civil rights activists on the bus that was set on fire during the Freedom Riders’ journey.
Nelson acknowledged his good fortune in interviewing Miller, who complicated the traditional view of the Deep South during the civil rights era, he said.
“She was the last person we interviewed and that was divine intervention,” Nelson said. “Even in the midst of all this craziness in Alabama, there is goodness.”
Nelson noted the critical role young people played in enacting political change during the civil rights movement, reiterating the influence of college students in particular to initiate change in society.
“Young people made these movements work,” Nelson said. “They made change. Young people can still do that.”
The event attracted a wide array of students, regular church members, alumni, and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
“I’m struck by how our students know so little about this very recent chapter in history,” Dingman said of the civil rights movement Nelson features in his documentaries.
Janet M. Kinasewich ’74, a member of Memorial Church, attended the event because of her preacher’s past involvement in the civil rights movement in Selma.
“He [Rev. Clark Olsen] went to Selma with two other Unitarian ministers…to be a part of the march and some men came up behind them and beat them,” Kinasewich said. “One of the three was beaten so badly that he died a couple days later.”
The annual Noble Lecture Series was established in 1898 by Nannie Yulee Noble in memory of her husband.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 15, 2015, at 12:44 a.m.
Top administrators relocated again on Tuesday morning as the environmental activist group Divest Harvard continued its planned blockade of Massachusetts Hall, staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the Harvard Alumni Association, and temporarily blocked entrances to University Hall.
After blocking the doors to University Hall for four hours, Divest Harvard demonstrators pulled back at 10:15 a.m., but as of Tuesday evening, the group and its supporters still blocked the doors of Mass. Hall. About a dozen alumni demonstrators, meanwhile, were preparing to occupy the Alumni Association offices on Mt. Auburn Street for a second consecutive night.
Tuesday was the third consecutive day of protests for Divest Harvard, which began blockading Mass. Hall on Sunday and has said it will continue its planned “Heat Week” protest until Friday, April 17. Divest Harvard and its supporters are demanding that the University divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
Early Tuesday morning, members of the group moved to blockade a second administrative building in Harvard Yard—University Hall, which houses the offices of top officials at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
By 6 a.m. Tuesday, about 25 Divest Harvard protesters had blocked six entrances to University Hall, and by 7 a.m. had denied entrance to two custodial workers. Other University Hall staffers approached the building before turning away.
At 10:15 a.m., Divest Harvard left the doors of University Hall, but the protesters had already forced administrators to start their days elsewhere. By 9 a.m., University President Drew G. Faust, Khurana, and Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp had gone to work at the Smith Campus Center. Faust and Lapp usually work out of Mass. Hall and Khurana out of University Hall.
While Divest Harvard announced its plans to blockade Mass. Hall last week, the group had not publicly disclosed intentions to target other buildings. The group decided to blockade University Hall after administrators did not respond directly to their blockade of Mass. Hall on Monday, avoiding the building and finding other locations to work, according to Divest Harvard co-coordinator Talia K. Rothstein ’17.
All of the blockaders surrounding University Hall had completed civil disobedience training and were willing to risk arrest, Rothstein said.
“We want to pressure the University to act,” Divest Harvard alumni coordinator Benjamin A. Franta, a Harvard graduate student, said outside of University Hall on Tuesday. “This is our next step.”
Top University officials, barred from entering their offices, were spotted around the Yard on Tuesday morning. Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, who works in University Hall, said shortly after 9:15 a.m. that he might eventually go to Starbucks to work. Associate Dean of the College Joan Rouse was spotted on her way to Au Bon Pain.
“It's an inconvenience, but it’s not stopping us from doing what we need to do,” Lassonde said during the blockade.
On Tuesday, as on previous days, protesters and police interacted amicably, with Divest Harvard member Henney Sullivan ’15 acting as a liaison between the group and officers from the Harvard University Police Department.
Meanwhile, at the Alumni Association offices on Mt. Auburn Street, 10 protesters who spent the night there—nine in the office and one in the hallway between the elevator and the office, blocked by police from joining fellow demonstrators—continued to demand a meeting with association leaders to discuss divestment on Tuesday morning, according to Bill E. McKibben ’82, the leader of the environmental group 350.org and a former Crimson president who camped out in the office Monday night.
The demonstrators had tic tacs and coffee for breakfast Tuesday morning. Harvard Police barred other protesters from delivering food to peers inside until about 9:10 a.m. but then allowed supporters to deliver some supplies, McKibben said. Thirteen protesters planned to stay at the Alumni Association on Tuesday night, according to 350.org coordinator Collin A. Rees ’12.
“We’re curious to see what exactly it takes to get a meeting with your alumni representative,” McKibben said on Tuesday morning.
The forced relocations likely inconvenienced Harvard’s top leaders. Faust spends much of days on her campus working from Mass. Hall, meeting with her senior staff and receiving a number of visitors, including dignitaries and prospective donors to Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign.
Jeff Neal, Faust’s spokesperson, declined to comment on administrators' whereabouts on Tuesday. But on Monday, Neal wrote in a statement that affected administrators were finding other places to work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the opportunity to extend their collegiate careers by one more race, many of the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field seniors took advantage and qualified to the historic Harvard-Yale vs. Oxford-Cambridge meet this summer.
Captain Jarvis Harris was not satisfied with just one spot however. The senior would notch victories in the 110-meter hurdles, 4x100 relay, and 4x400 meter relay to qualify in three different events.
After finishing the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.23 seconds, Harris anchored the winning 4x100 relay to a tight 41.63 finish and opened the 4x400 meter relay, giving his teammates a lead which would turn into a first-place 3:20.59 mark.
“He’s been tremendous,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “Not only is he a record holder both indoors and outdoors but he’s a tremendous worker, an incredible competitor, and always willing to lay himself out there for the team.”
The Ama, La., native has established himself as one of the top athletes on the Crimson squad as evidenced by the list of accomplishments he has compiled since arriving in Cambridge. Harris holds the program records in the 60-meter and 110-meter hurdles and has taken home Ancient Eight titles in both events as well.
Harris’s affinity for success has seemingly increased when facing the rival Bulldogs, with the captain winning the 110-meter hurdles in all four renditions of the annual rivalry meet in which he has competed.
Despite the success which the senior has obtained in his collegiate career, Harris strives to improve his performance and time. When asked about his performances this season, the senior immediately explained potential improvements which can be made in order to churn out even faster times and continue to improve at both the individual and team level.
“[I’m] continuing the training that I’ve been doing,” Harris said. “I’ll improve my hurdling by fine-tuning my starts and I’ll improve my 400 times, both my 400 hurdle and my 400 contribution to the relay by getting more conditioning in.”
Harris’s impact on the team spreads further than just the numbers and statistics found on the results sheet, as the senior has provided valuable guidance and leadership as one of two elected captains on the men’s team this year.
As the sole senior sprinter on the men’s side, Harris has helped the younger athletes both on the track—such as being the only runner in the 4x100 relay with more than two years of collegiate racing under his belt—and off the track, where the captain has helped underclassmen adapt to the elite level of competition at meets such as the Florida Relays.
“He plays a really valuable role especially for our sprinters and hurdlers on the men’s side,” Saretsky said. “It’s a really young group and they really benefit from his years of wisdom, the mistakes he’s made along the way, and his ability to show them this is what it takes if you really want to be successful.”
With his career donning Crimson winding down, Harris hopes to end his collegiate days on a high note. One of the senior’s main goals for the year is to qualify for the finals of an event at the NCAA Championships in Eugene, Ore., this year.
A top-eight finish would make Harris the first Crimson male first team All-American since pole vaulter Nico Weiler '12-13 did so with his fourth-place finish in the competition.
“My ultimate collegiate goal is to make it to the finals in one of my events, whether it be the 110-meter hurdles or the 400-meter hurdles.” Harris said.
With the careers of the seniors on the team beginning to wrap up, many will fondly look back and reflect on their time in Cambridge filled with great memories and experiences.
Among those seniors is Harris. With his last Harvard-Yale behind him and only a few races—and months—left until the team bids adieu to one of its best all-time sprinters, the senior is happy with what he has accomplished and is confident about the promising future to which the Crimson has to look forward.
“Over the summation of my entire four years of track with Harvard I would say that I am satisfied with what I’ve done in that I’ve tried to not just elevate myself and maximize my potential to the best of my abilities but also I’ve been able to elevate my team over these last four years especially now with the role of captain,” Harris said. “Being able to apply myself more to the team to elevate us and steer us in the right direction so that we can become a championship-winning program and I see it before my eyes, growing and developing and moving in that direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 14, 2015, at 2:56 a.m.
­For UMass, the third time was the charm against Harvard.
A four-run fourth inning propelled the Minutemen to a 6-5 win and a spot in the Beanpot Championship. The visiting Crimson (16-16, 5-7 Ivy) had handily beaten UMass (9-11, 7-5 Atlantic 10) in two prior meetings over spring break in Florida, winning the two contests by a combined nine runs.
The loss means that Harvard will be unable to defend last year’s Beanpot title, which the team captured after shutting out the Minutemen in the finals, 3-0.
“Last year, being able to win the Beanpot was definitely a highlight of our season,” said sophomore first baseman Matt Hink. “This year, being the team with the target on our back, it was kind of tough to lose by one. It’s still a cool opportunity to play at Fenway and hopefully we can get out of it with a win.”
The Minutemen’s breakthrough came after the Crimson jumped out to a 3-0 lead following an RBI single by freshman John Fallon and two UMass wild pitches.
Freshman Noah Zavolas, making his first collegiate start, cruised through his first three innings of work for Harvard, only allowing one run while striking out two batters.
But the rookie would allow two singles to start the fourth before giving up a three-run home run to Minutemen right fielder Adam Picard to tie the ballgame.
Zavolas was then replaced by fellow first-year Dylan Combs, but left fielder Dylan Morris’ stealing of home gave UMass a one-run edge. The Crimson was stretched for pitching on Monday after using 10 different arms in the weekend series against Brown.
“It’s definitely difficult for any staff to deal with that many games in that few days, but it just takes each man to step up when he’s called on,” Rupp said. “It is really good for having a new outlook for each game because you have to be quick-minded.”
Harvard fought back after falling behind, picking up a run in the fifth on a bases-loaded walk and in the sixth on shortstop Drew Reid’s first collegiate home run.
The Crimson struggled to put together a big inning on Monday, something that has been somewhat of a trademark of the team this season. The offense was without starting second baseman and three-hole hitter Jake McGuiggan, who is second on the team in runs and RBIs, due to an injury the senior suffered against Brown.
“[Not having McGuiggan] definitely makes a difference,” Hink said. “While we have had guys stepping up, we didn’t have the best approach at the plate. We chased a lot of pitches out of the zone. You always feel comfortable with him up there.”
Combs started the bottom of the seventh inning but found himself out of the game before the end of the frame. Morris singled to start the inning, when Minutemen leadoff-hitter Kyle Adie drove in the game-tying run and ended Combs’ day.
Freshman Garrett Rupp replaced his classmate with one down in the seventh but uncorked a wild pitch to give UMass a 6-5 lead it would not relinquish. Despite a scoreless eighth inning from Rupp, Harvard was unable to get a run across in its half of the eighth or ninth to extend the game.
“I’m just thankful to have the opportunity to be out there trying to get the team a win,” Rupp said. “Each time you have a good outing, it gives the staff more confidence.”
Fallon doubled to lead off the eighth and advanced to third on a wild pitch, putting pressure on Minutemen pitcher Evan Mackintosh. But the Crimson would fail to take advantage. Left fielder Jack Colton and captain Ethan Ferreira both struck out swinging to end the threat.
Missed opportunities sealed Harvard’s fate at Earl Lorden Field. The Crimson stranded 12 runners on the day, compared to just three on behalf of UMass.
Harvard would strand another runner in the top of the ninth, failing to plate the tying run to force extras. Minutemen sophomore Mike Geannelis worked around a hit-by-pitch to pick up his second save of the season and send UMass to its fourth consecutive Beanpot final.
The loss was Harvard’s fourth in its last six games. The team has played in three consecutive one-run games over the course of the past three days ,winning only one of them.
The Crimson now finds itself in the consolation game for the second time in three years. Combs was tagged with his second loss of the season for Harvard. The left side of the Crimson’s infield combined for four of Harvard’s nine hits and two RBIs. The Crimson’s .500 mark through 32 games is still the team’s best since 2007.

The sun is finally shining bright, midterms are winding down—and we are only weeks away from finals! Now is a good time to test out that new study spot before hunkering back down for reading period. Need ideas? Flyby has got you covered with a comprehensive list of must-try study locales for warmer weather.

1. Café Gato Rojo
Not only does Café Gato Rojo undeniably have the best coffee on campus, but you can also get a pot of tea for only one dollar. Located directly inside Harvard Yard in the basement of Lehman Hall (Dudley House), Gato Rojo is the cheap/better alternative to Starbucks you’ve been looking for. It also has a rotating art exhibit!
2. The Harvard Art Museums Atrium
Newly renovated with a fancy café and glass ceiling, the Harvard Art Museums atrium offers a relaxed atmosphere and plenty of inspiration. It also comes with endless amounts of modern art to procrastinate on your paper by trying to understand it. To start, help Flyby figure out what the news ticker in the basement is trying to tell us about the human condition.
3. Dudley Garden
Spent too many hours inside Lamont and feel yourself turning into a Lamonster? Change things up a bit and head right around the corner to Dudley Garden. Soak up the sun and take in nature while you catch up on all of those readings. Side note, according to a Harvard Magazine article, “during the revolutionary days of 1969, it was closed to the public on account of various naughtinesses occurring within.”
4. Café Algiers
Located off of Harvard Square above the Brattle Street Theatre, this charming café will never bore you. If you miss winter and snow, you can relax Faust-style with a hot orange mint chocolate, or grab a Middle Eastern inspired meal before you start to study. There are also two floors and an awesome octagonal ceiling!

After what feels like 36 straight months of snow, sleet, and cold weather all around, it finally seems like spring is here. In order to remind you how to enjoy warm weather and fresh air, Flyby presents our guide for a sunny day.
1.  Support Local Businesses
The emergence of the sun from its five month-long hiatus necessitates at least two things: summer clothing and iced beverages. If you’ve managed to forget all of your t-shirts and shorts at home in your haste to pack every sweatshirt you own, then you’re probably going to have to stop by a local store and pick up a trendy new outfit so you won’t be sweating in your parka and boots. Between your ventures into Harvard Square’s myriad clothing stores, be sure to pick up a cold refreshing drink like an iced coffee or a frappe!
2. Get Fit
Nice weather means no excuse to avoid exercise. If you like uneven brick paths and sporadic pot holes, you should definitely opt for a jog through the Square. If your preference is for crowded one-way streets, you could ride your bike along Mass Ave. If you want to see how many tourists you can get to join in your exercise, you might want to try some Tai Chi in Harvard Yard.
3. Take a Stroll Along the Charles
Pluck up the courage and ask that brown-eyed hottie from section what their plans for Wednesday afternoon are. When they list no less than 17 academic and extracurricular commitments to you, spend 45 minutes trying to coordinate a time when you are both free (maybe after lecture and before tutorial? Should someone just send out a Doodle poll?). If the stars align and you set the date, it promises to be a wonderful afternoon of pleasant conversation and good company.
4. Picnic in the Yard
Pack a blanket, parasol, and bagged HUDS lunch, and choose your favorite patch of grass in Tercentenary Theatre to sit comfortably. We recommend a spot where you can watch freshmen running from their dorms in a halfhearted attempt to make it to Sever exactly on Harvard time for class. A word of caution for even the most naturally cautious: the Yard squirrels have no qualms about running off with a PB & J.

If you’re looking for a free trip to Puerto Rico, you might find it in the Lowell House Dining Hall this Friday night. 400 students are expected to attend Lowell’s “Puerto Lowell” party on April 17th in the hopes of winning the raffle for a free trip with a friend to Puerto Rico, and a lavish night at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in San Juan.
The agenda for the party is as follows: Show up at the door at 9:30 pm, watch Hassan and Balliett draw the lucky ticket at 12:30 am, then, if you’re lucky enough to have bought the winning ticket, get on a plane with a friend headed for San Juan early that Saturday morning.
The lucky winner and his or her guest will earn one night, all expenses paid, at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in San Juan. Alas, twenty-four hours later, the lucky travelers will return on a pre-paid flight back to Cambridge on Sunday evening.
According to Hassan and Balliett, the event’s organizers got the idea to host Puerto Lowell after hearing about Lowell throwing a similar event in the 1980s.  Since no other house, to their knowledge, has replicated this model, they expect it to be very popular, even hoping to make a profit from the event.
Although there’s a very slim chance of winning the trip (it’s higher if you go with a friend who promises to take you if they win), the party is expected to be incredibly popular.
As Hassan said, “it’s the Ritz in San Juan, it doesn’t get better than that.”
