After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Suffolk Superior Court judge denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit slamming the University’s sanctions against single-sex organizations on January 9.
The denial of Harvard’s motion to dismiss comes more than a year after a group of sororities, fraternities, and students sued Harvard in both federal and Massachusetts state court in response to the University’s social group sanctions.
The sanctions — enforced beginning with the class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity team athletic captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The federal complaint alleges that the social group policy violates both Title IX and the United States Constitution by promoting sex-based discrimination.
The Massachusetts complaint, brought forth by Greek organizations Alpha Phi and Iota Tau, claims that the sanctions violated both the state’s constitution and Civil Rights Act by “interfering with their freedom of association” and “discriminating against their members on the basis of sex.”
Harvard’s motion to dismiss the state lawsuit relied upon the argument that Alpha Phi and Iota Tau acted outside the confines of Massachusetts Civil Rights Act by bringing claims on behalf of their members.
The court disagreed with this argument, citing associations’ right to bring forth claims on behalf of their members under certain circumstances.
“An association has standing to bring suit against its own members when: its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit,” Superior Court judge Linda E. Giles’s order read.
Giles determined that Alpha Phi and Iota Tau fulfilled all three of these requirements.
Harvard also argued that the suing organizations failed to provide adequate evidence to establish a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
The court also rejected this point. The order determined that the plaintiff demonstrated “the exercise or enjoyment of some constitutional or statutory right; has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with,” a necessary condition to sue under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
Emma M. Quinn-Judge, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement that she believes the court’s decision to deny the dismissal of the lawsuit reveals the discriminatory nature of the sanctions.
“Two courts have now concluded that Harvard’s policy may be discriminatory and unlawful,” Quinn-Judge said. “Harvard should listen to the courts and stop taking away opportunities from its students.”
CEO of the National Panhellenic Conference Dani Weatherford and CEO of the North American Interfraternity Conference Judson Horras also wrote a joint statement supporting the judge’s decision to let the state suit proceed.
“It is now long-past time for Harvard to repeal this discriminatory policy,” they wrote. “Instead of enforcing a policy that tramples students’ rights at Harvard, we hope the university will join us in productive dialogue about building a healthy and more inclusive campus culture.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email Thursday that the University still remains hopeful about the case despite the judge’s ruling.
“While this decision is disappointing, it says nothing about the ultimate merits of our case,” Dane wrote. “We’re confident that once the entire story is heard, the court will allow Harvard to continue fighting discrimination on our campus in all of its forms.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The former White House Communications Director and Chief Speechwriter for President Bill Clinton and National Public Radio’s first Moscow bureau chief are among the fellows who will join the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy this spring, the center announced Thursday.
The two Joan Shorenstein Fellows — former NPR Moscow bureau chief Ann Cooper and NBC investigative journalist April Glaser — will focus on writing a paper titled “Russian Media and the Legacy of Glasnost” and studying internet policy and user safety, respectively.
They join two Walter Shorenstein Fellows, former White House Communications Director and Chief Speechwriter for President Bill Clinton Don Baer and former Controller of BBC Radio 4 and 4 Extra Gwyneth Williams.
Two fellows from this past fall, author Tara Westover and computer scientist Kathy Pham will continue their affiliations with the Center into the spring.
Baer said he intends for his study group to focus on the role of public media in the United States.
“What I’m hoping to do is to take a look at the opportunities and challenges that exist for public media in the United States, building on my role as Chair of the Board of Directors of PBS, and also talk about the ways there could be intersection and coordination between public media and private sector media to help drive a robust national conversation,” Baer said.
“I’m hoping to bring some people that I’ve worked with over the years from one part of that equation or the other to the Kennedy School and to my study group so that they can help to lead that conversation and engage and integrate some new perspectives,” he added.
The fellowship marks Baer’s second visit to HKS, following an Institute of Politics fellowship in 1997. He said he was “looking forward” to his time back at the school.
“I think the community there is just so stimulating and dynamic, and I’m excited to work with students and people on the faculty and people in general who are a part of it,” Baer said.
Cooper said she will prepare a paper centered on the “opening up of speech and press” during Glasnost in Russia, Putin’s subsequent rollbacks, and the policy’s implications in the present. Glasnost was a Soviet government policy instituted in the mid-1980s that allowed for open discussion of political and social ideas.
“There is very, very little freedom of the press in Russia, and that is true for traditional media. But amazingly, there are, you know, young people and people who are not traditional journalists who are pursuing investigative reporting or, you know, writing good political analysis, writing about social issues, and still going into that profession — that field,” Cooper said.
Shorenstein Center Communications Director Liz Schwartz called the new fellows an “interesting” group.
“We have a lot of different experiences, and expertise, but I think they’re all bringing this lens of how do we make the public conversation better, and information better, and make it possible for people to access the information that they need in different ways,” Schwartz said.

In previous years, many instructors teaching courses in the College’s required General Education program independently ran lotteries to keep their courses from going over enrollment capacity. As a result, many lotteries ran on different timelines and criteria.
Starting this spring, that will change. The Gen Ed office will pilot a new coordinated lottery system, asking students to rank their Gen Ed course choices and seek enrollment in one or more courses through a single randomized process.
The new semester starts in a week — and with it, course shopping and enrollment. To help navigate the new Gen Ed lottery system, here’s a primer on the process.
The Gen Ed office started working to create a new lottery system last summer in collaboration with Harvard University Information Technology, the Advising Programs Office, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office, and the Office of Undergraduate Education after observing that some students successfully lotteried into multiple courses while others failed to lottery into any courses.
The new system aims to allow more students to successfully lottery into a Gen Ed course and to relieve student stress, according to the Gen Ed office.
Students will be able to request enrollment in up to five Gen Ed courses on my.harvard. They will then be required to rank their choices by 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday during shopping week, the first week of each semester during which students may try out classes before formally enrolling.
If the requested enrollment for a given Gen Ed course does not exceed the limit, all students who requested to enroll will automatically be granted permission.
The Gen Ed office will lottery off seats in over-requested courses. Students will rank their preferences for Gen Ed courses, and the office will use a unified ranked-choice system to assign students to their highest possible preferences.
The Gen Ed office will notify students of their lottery results by 2 p.m. on Thursday during shopping week, and they can choose whether to enroll in the courses they were granted permission to enter. Students who request to enroll in five Gen Ed courses should get into at least one, according to the office’s website.
After the lottery ends, students may petition to enter courses that still have open seats.
No, since lottery results will be determined according to the randomized algorithm.
Gen Ed courses will not have applications to enter the lottery, and the Gen Ed office said it instructed faculty not to approve enrollment petitions before the lottery runs.
Not even seniors who must take a course to graduate will necessarily be guaranteed a seat by the lottery, though the Gen Ed office said students should reach out if this occurs.
Gen Ed courses have a size limit of between 50 and 250 students.
In the spring of 2019, the FAS Standing Committee on General Education decided to cap all Gen Ed courses at 250 students. Individual instructors can additionally choose to impose a lower enrollment cap if they wish.
Several faculty members said last fall during shopping week that they were confused and frustrated by the new rule capping Gen Ed classes.
The only course with an enrollment cap larger than 250 after the new rule was instituted was GENED 1058: “Tech Ethics: AI, Biotech, and the Future of Human Nature,” offered in fall 2019. The course had a larger cap of 900 students because it formed part of an experiment with larger course sizes.
No Gen Ed course enrollments will exceed 250 students this spring, according to the course catalog.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong showing against rivals Yale at Madison Square Garden, the No. 16 Harvard men’s hockey team returned to Bright-Landry for its first slate of home games in the new year. Its challengers, St. Lawrence and No. 7 Clarkson, had not faced the Crimson so far in the season. With the Saints posing relatively easy competition and the Golden Knights a tougher task, Harvard looked to recapture its winning ways and earn another four-point weekend, which it hadn’t been able to accomplish since late November.
The first part of that aim was a success; the second, less so. The Crimson (9-6-2, 7-4-1 ECAC) struck thrice on the powerplay to defeat St. Lawrence (3-19-3, 1-12) by a score of 3-1, but struggled to put together enough man-up tallies for a comeback victory the next night, falling to Clarkson (16-5-2, 10-3) by a score of 5-3.
“We just got to execute on some things better, and we just need to play more intelligent,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I liked our compete level, I liked our work ethic. I thought we did a lot of good things, but when you take that many penalties you put yourself [behind].”
Freshman Mitchell Gibson started both games for Harvard this weekend; he has been between the pipes for eight out of the team’s past nine contests. Though the backstop turned in one of his best performances versus the Saints, a team-wide sloppy first period against the Golden Knights marred his numbers.
Not coincidentally, the team had trouble staying out of the penalty box this weekend — an unusual problem for a speed-and-skill group that prefers to play with the man advantage. Despite the weekend’s negative conclusion, the Crimson’s star players have continued to make their marks on the scoresheet. Rookie Nick Abruzzese (8–13—21) leads all first-years in points per game (1.24), and is second in team scoring.
He and his linemates, sophomores Jack Drury (1.36) and Casey Dornbach (1.35), are the ECAC’s top three skaters in terms of points per game. Sophomore Jack Rathbone and junior Reilly Walsh, for their part, are tied for the scoring lead among conference defensemen.
“I think as a team, we have to be able to handle adversity better and not let it snowball into going 3-1 and 4-1,” coach Donato said. “If we can keep the game a little bit closer when they’re riding momentum and adrenaline, it gives us a much better chance to get the result we want at the end.”
CLARKSON 5, HARVARD 3
On Saturday night, Harvard played host to its first top-ten ranked opponent since December’s matchup against then-No. 2 Cornell. Unfortunately for the Crimson, this contest also ended in disappointment.
The game began with a promising break for Harvard: just two seconds into the first period, Clarkson was penalised and the Crimson was given a powerplay opportunity. Special teams were expected to be the highlight of a clash between these two teams. The Golden Knights came into Saturday with a whopping 92.4 percent penalty-killing efficiency, good for second in the country, while Harvard owned the nation-best powerplay conversion rate at 30.4 percent.
Clarkson managed to shut down the hosts’ initial chance, though — a sign of things to come. However, the hosts broke the ice for the second time that weekend. Just over four minutes into the game, a series of turnovers put the puck within Dornbach’s reach. The winger, who was all alone on the left side, turned on the jets and beat graduate student net-minder Frank Marotte glove-side.
Not too long after, however, the Golden Knights responded on a 5-on-3, with junior defenseman Connor McCarthy firing a shot past Gibson. The floodgates opened; in the nine or so minutes that followed, Clarkson scored three more goals, one being a powerplay tally.
“We dug ourselves a hole in the first period,” coach Donato said. “We weren’t able to stop the bleeding. We get the quick goal to start the game, and we put ourselves down 5-on-3. We did [that] a couple times tonight, and that’s a recipe for disaster.”
All of a sudden, the visitors were up, 4-1, and the Crimson was left reeling. Harvard had built a solid first-period record so far this season, scoring 22 goals and conceding only 7 in opening frames until Saturday. The lone bright spot was a powerplay conversion late in the first, as Abruzzese went up the right side and top-corner on Marotte.
The Crimson entered the second period with a two-goal hole to climb out of. That middle frame offered plenty of chances, as the teams traded penalties throughout. But with all the whistles and the back-and-forth play, neither group entirely took control of the game.
“After it was 4-1, I liked the fact that we dug in and started to play the way we’re capable of,” coach Donato said. “I think the penalties that we took, took us out of the opportunity to hold onto momentum for longer.”
Harvard cleaned up its team defense in that middle period, and Gibson settled into his crease. When the third period began and the hosts found themselves on the man-advantage once more, it seemed as though the dam would have to break.
And it did, as Drury passed to Abruzzese in the slot and the first-year had the patience to wait out Marotte before roofing it past the net-minder. The Crimson had several other good looks, including three powerplay opportunities, and outshot its opponent 17-7, but was unable to capitalize and finally tie the game. The Golden Knights added an empty-netter to close out the contest.
HARVARD 3, ST. LAWRENCE 1
On Friday night, the Crimson’s first home contest in over a month, the hosts came ready to recreate the offensive prowess that had catapulted them past Yale the previous week. St. Lawrence sat at the very bottom of the ECAC points table, and had been outscored 42-79 in the season so far.
“We knew that they were going to work hard,” Walsh said. “Every ECAC team, you know what you’re going to get. We tried our best not to look at their record in previous games.”
Harvard managed to kill its first penalty, and was rewarded with a powerplay chance of its own midway through the first period. It took less than a minute for the Crimson to find the back of the net. As the top man-advantage unit on the ice cycled the puck, Rathbone found himself in the high slot with a narrow shooting lane.
Rather than trying to shoot through St. Lawrence penalty-killers, though, Rathbone sent a shot-pass intentionally wide to where Drury was waiting at the side of the net. The forward tapped in the puck to beat senior net-minder Daniel Mannella.
With possession of the lead, Harvard killed another penalty and again the Saints were whistled, this time for holding. Freshman forward John Farinacci wove his way into the zone around opposing defenders and tried to go far-side on Mannella. Senior forward Colton Kerfoot redirected his linemate’s attempt into the back of the cage for the 2-0 lead.
By contrast only one goal was scored in the middle frame, a powerplay slapper from Walsh at the top of the left circle. The tally broke a five-game goal drought for the defenseman.
“The second period, I thought they pushed us,” Walsh said. “I thought we weathered it fine. But especially [against teams like Clarkson], that’s not going to work for us. For us, we’ve got to take those lessons from tonight and make sure we’re learning those.”
The teams traded penalties in the third period as Gibson pursued a second-straight shutout. A little over halfway through the period, though, the Saints managed to break his bid on a 5-on-4.
Junior defensemen Bo Hanson and Jake Stevens played catch with the puck at the blue line, with Stevens finally holding. His wrist shot through the screen fooled Gibson, and gave the visitors their first tally of the night. Despite that success, St. Lawrence was unable to mount a comeback in the remaining several minutes.
“We kind of expected we would have to grind a game out, tied, but our powerplay came through,” coach Donato said. “We had excellent goaltending. In a game we really needed to win, we did enough to get the two points.”
