After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elif I. Batuman ’99, a staff writer for The New Yorker, is the author of the newly published novel “The Idiot.” The book chronicles the experiences of Selin Karadag, a Turkish American beginning her freshman year at Harvard in 1995. Batuman spoke with The Harvard Crimson about her writing process and sources of inspiration, both literary and autobiographical.
The Harvard Crimson: In the novel, Selin seems to wish to write a novel from the beginning—to what extent would you describe the novel as autobiographical?
Elif I. Batuman: Well, it’s about a Turkish American who is a freshman at Harvard in 1995, and that is my experience ... I wrote the first draft in 2000, 2001. So at that time, all of those things were a lot fresher in my mind, and since that time, what I wrote in the novel has kind of replaced my actual memories.  In the process of revision it felt much more like writing a fictional novel, especially because that character, that 18-year-old person, by the time I was revising it, I was 38. . So I was reading it, and I was identifying with all the different people. So I think I wrote it sort of in an autobiographical spirit and then revised it in the spirit of a novel.
THC: I imagine the title of the novel is a reference to Dostoevsky’s “The Idiot.” What would you say the connections are between the two works?
EIB: Russian is thematically important in the novel: Selin takes first-year Russian, to the conversation with the love interest, Ivan. He’s really into Dostoevsky, and she’s not into it so much. So definitely there, but actually the reason I called it “The Idiot” was that I think there are actually parallels between “The Idiot” and my book which I didn’t really think about at the time. But people have asked about them, and now I can kind of see that it’s there. So Dostoevsky’s “The Idiot” is also about this young, kind of clueless person who arrives in a foreign place and makes all these friends his own age and has these very strong ideas about how to live and then falls in love with an inappropriate person and runs around in a very inefficient way. So there is some similarity. But really, I called it “The Idiot” because, in the process of revision, I realized that when I had first written the novel, there were parts about it I was embarrassed about, which to me were the embarrassing awkward aspects of my life as a freshman when I was 18. At age 23, when I was writing this novel about it, I tried to have a certain distance between the narrator and the character, I think just to prove, “Oh I’m not so dumb.” Anyway, so there were all these parts that were kind of like, “Oh when we’re young, oh we’re so foolish, and then when we’re old, we’re wiser.” When I was rereading it, all of that seemed like bullshit. The only thing that I cared about was what was happening to that 18-year-old person, even when those things were very difficult and when she was being confronted by her lack of knowledge about the world, and that’s when I thought about this book as “The Idiot.”
THC: How much of a satire is the novel? It certainly seems humorous to an extent, for example in the depiction of lectures in the beginning of the novel and also the characters’ own ideas about their lives.
EIB: I think that the idea was to show that Selin is someone who… She doesn’t totally understand the conventional aspects of language, she doesn’t understand that a lot of what we say is a formula, she doesn’t understand the job interview. You know that she goes to a job interview, and the people at Let’s Go are like, “What do we miss out on when we don’t hire you?” And she’s like “Oh my god, that’s the most perverse question, like how could anyone ask that?” But she goes to her classes, and the people are like, well everything that they say, she is like, “Oh, well, this is what human knowledge is? This is it?” The epigraph of the book is about how when we’re young we take what everyone says as a literal expression of what they meant. We think that everything they say is reflective of the essential part of their character, so we live our lives surrounded by gods and monsters in the way we don’t when we’re older. I think it is true that when we’re older we realize the way that people act is … you know, everyone’s kind of talking off the cuff, and everyone’s, you know, spitballing sometimes. I’ve gotten in classes with undergraduates and said things that were definitely not a transparent reflection of my deeply held beliefs, but you just say things because you have to, at times. Then she obviously doesn’t understand, but the world does look grotesque and cartoonish to her and in that sense, it does look a little bit satirical. Because human relations aren’t meant to be viewed that way.
THC: In the book, “Don Quixote” comes up several times. What is the significance of that?
EIB: The relation to “Don Quixote” … I actually wrote my dissertation about it. It was kind of a theory of the novel, and basically I think the novel is a synthesis between the writer’s favorite book and open-ended reality. I think the first novel, well, I don’t know if it’s the first, but the paradigmatic novel that fits that description is “Don Quixote,” where he loves these chivalric romances. Cervantes clearly loves these romances: he creates a character who loves these romances and who wants to live them. [...] So the plot of the novel is generated as a collision between real life and the kind of scripts that you bring to it, that you want to come true. And people say that “Don Quixote” is a book about how chivalric romances are stupid, or Don Quixote loved his favorite books too much and it ruined his life. I don’t think it’s about that at all. I think it’s about if you only follow your favorite books, then yeah, you end up living in this delusional world that’s cut off from reality, and reality can’t have any way in. But if you only follow your life, if you just went out and talked to windmills, then it wouldn’t be a story, it would just be a list of stuff. The favorite books that you bring in are kind of what gives structure to that. I guess I think of Selin as being a quixotic character in that books are really important to her, stories are really important to her, and she tries to see herself as a person in this story. But the way things turn out doesn’t always correspond exactly to the story that she’s telling. She has these kind of comic misadventures, but they are also very painful, kind of like running into a windmill with a spear would be painful. I guess that’s the connection that I see.
THC: A lot of the characters seem to be international students. What do you think about the connection between English as the language of the novel, the many characters who do not seem to be speaking in their native languages, and Selin’s own relation to her Turkish heritage?
EIB: There’s something different about the way young people talk and the way that the language is alive and new but also different and richer. I think that did make my world feel bigger, to have more different kinds of English. Actually, I’ve taught creative writing in Turkey, at an English language university, where the students were native Turkish speakers, but they were writing their essays in English, and they were very interesting—even the sense of structure, the conventions of writing, the different styles of writing. There were very different, very striking things that I think expand and enrich a language. I think Bakhtin says that the defining feature of a novel is that it has many different languages or dialects in it, within the same national language. Insofar as the novel has many languages, that’s how rich it is, and I think that the non-native but proficient languages really add a lot of richness to the language and to the novel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my last article, I wrote about how men benefit from male privilege. I wrote about how men, on a structural level, benefit from a system that establishes male dominance at the expense of women. I wrote, in no uncertain terms, that men are and will always be oppressors.
These statements proved to be extremely controversial. Men, especially those who consider themselves feminists, were angry that I called them oppressors. They invoked the “not all men” argument, and brought up all the ways in which they have supported women’s rights. Many men seemed to consider my statements a personal attack, and became defensive. If all men are oppressors, then what were they supposed to do? Was there nothing that men could do right? Was I simply advocating for male genocide?
This controversy, I believe, stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what privilege and oppression mean. Privilege is the idea that society grants unearned benefits to people because of certain aspects of their identity. And, on the flip side, there is oppression—the idea that society disadvantages people because of certain aspects of their identity. Privileged people, therefore, benefit at the expense of oppressed people.
However, privilege and oppression need to be understood in the context of larger power structures. Society is affected by different power structures—patriarchy, white supremacy, classism, and ableism, to name only a few. Under these power structures, privileged people hold institutional power over oppressed groups. Under the patriarchy, for example, men are the ones who hold political, economic, and social power. And indeed, if you look around the world, top political and economic leaders are almost all men. Men are overwhelmingly in charge of running companies and corporations, making and adjudicating laws, and producing knowledge.
Privilege, therefore, has nothing to do with individuals, and everything to do with larger power systems and structures in society. The structures in our society that bestow unearned benefits to men are the same ones that oppress women. This does not mean that every single individual man in the world is committing violence against women. It only means that, as long as the structures of patriarchy and sexism exist in the world, men are oppressors who will benefit at the expense of women.
Understandably, nobody likes being called an oppressor. But it is critical to acknowledge all the ways in which you are an oppressor. For example, I am an oppressor. As a cisgender and heterosexual person, I benefit from the oppression of LGBT people. As an able-bodied person, I benefit from the oppression of people with disabilities. The power structures of heterosexism, cissexism, and ableism grant me unearned benefits at the expense of LGBT people and people with disabilities.
But, once again, oppression and privilege are concepts that refer to structures, not individuals. When I say that I am an oppressor, I do not mean that I personally engage in violence against transgender people. I do not mean that I personally design buildings that are inaccessible to people in wheelchairs. In fact, as an individual, I strive to do the opposite. I strive to be an ally to the LGBT and disabled communities, and I acknowledge that I can and should always do more for those communities.
But at the end of the day, I can’t stop being an oppressor. No matter how many charities I donate to, how many LGBT rallies I attend, how many articles about ableism I read, or how many Crimson staff editorials about transgender rights I help write—I am still an oppressor. It doesn’t matter how well-intentioned I am. I will still indirectly benefit from the violence that is inflicted on those communities.
When society centers the experiences of heterosexual people as valid—for example, by allowing me to hold hands with my partner in public without fear of harassment and by portraying straight people almost exclusively in the media—it simultaneously marginalizes the experiences of LGBT people as invalid, deviant, and criminal.
When society caters exclusively to able-bodied people such as myself—for example, by designing buildings without ramps or by implementing education systems that prioritize only certain types of learning—it simultaneously oppresses people with disabilities by depriving them of access to education and physical buildings.
And so, it is time for us to move the conversation away from individuals and back towards structures. It is not helpful or productive when members of privileged groups demand recognition for their good deeds, or insist that “not all men” or “not all straight people” or “not all able-bodied people” are bad people. That is not what the conversation is about.
Instead, we need to focus on dismantling the power structures in society. For men, this means actively working to undo the structure of patriarchy. And for myself, this means actively working to undo the structures of heterosexism, cissexism, and ableism. We all have a lot of work to do. But the first step towards a more equitable world is the acknowledgement of our own privilege, and the ways in which we benefit from the oppression of others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the first-generation of Harvard College,
When I first sat down to write this letter, I envisioned addressing it to the administration in lieu of Dean Khurana’s rejection of the proposed First Year Institute bridge program. But, after reading Lauren Sierra’s story, captured beautifully in Bridge Over Troubled Water, I was inspired to direct my energy elsewhere. This is therefore a message to the first-generation students of Harvard College.
The CEO of my company recently asked me: How much of your identity was formed by your Harvard experience? My instinct was to say “a lot” given that my life, and consequently, my being, would look extremely different had I not graduated from Harvard. But then I started thinking about my Harvard self vs. myself now and the distance between. I thought about how much of a sponge I was as an undergraduate, carefully studying every event, every person, every interaction of my Harvard experience. How everything was so foreign and intriguing. How I assumed that all of these new experiences were superior to what I had known. How I neglected existing relationships that had propelled me to where I was because I viewed them as distractions from where I could go. I thought about how relentlessly focused I was on changing myself during that time, and whether or not that had come at the expense of strengthening my sense of self outside the Ivy League.
Harvard taught me a lot about the world outside of my own, but the world has taught me a lot about myself. I have learned that empathy is just as powerful of a skill as critical thinking for those who seek to create positive change in the world. I have learned that ambition should not and can not replace fulfilling relationships, whatever form they may take. I have learned that I am a role model with a voice that needs to be heard, both by the disadvantaged and by the overprivileged. Perhaps most importantly, I have learned that I am advantaged because I am a first-gen, a fact that couldn’t have felt further from the truth during my time at Harvard.
Success is built on greatness, not bridges. And you are great—a low-key unicorn, some might say. You have overcome barriers associated with income, educational opportunity, unconventional familial roles, race and ethnicity, language, sexuality, and likely much more. Some of these challenges may subside after your Harvard experience. But, unfortunately, many of them will remain. You'll be the breadwinner of your family, if you're not already. You'll continue to occupy spaces that were not constructed with you in mind (and may even be attracted to them by your desire to disrupt them). You'll continue to balance an untamable personal ambition with the most austere indebtedness to those who got you to where you are today. And you might continue to feel lonely, even when you're not alone. These are the unique burdens you carry. And they are the burdens that most of the people around you fail to recognize out of the blissful ignorance of privilege.
But I see you. And I feel compelled to tell you that it truly does gets better and that your burdens will grow into blessings. You will feel blessed when you are able to help your mom pay the mortgage when unexpected funeral costs arise. You will feel blessed when you are granted opportunities when those in positions of power recognize the value of your story of triumph. You will feel blessed by your humble grounding as you ascend the social ladder and the air of humility continues to thin. You will realize that you have been tested in ways that those around you couldn't even imagine and that you have passed those tests with flying colors, becoming more qualified than anyone else to do exactly what you want to do in the world.
Former First Lady Michelle Obama said it best: when they go low, we go high. Seize your strength sooner than I did. (You can start by reaching out to mentors like me and other members of the Harvard First Generation Alumni Association.) Once you do, there is no limit to how high you can go. And I have a strong suspicion that Harvard will follow your lead: upward.
All the first-gen love,
Dan

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a wise, responsible, and commendable move, the Undergraduate Council has committed $2,000 across six peer counseling groups for dining support during Opening Days trainings. Providing confidential, highly trained mental health support in several contexts—relationships, sexual assault, marginalized cultural communities, eating disorders, and others—these groups routinely demonstrate selflessness, compassion, and care.
Naturally, these vital services demand substantial time sacrifices on the part of volunteer peer counselors, who are not compensated financially but only driven by the fulfillment of supporting their peers. This makes their dedication yet more admirable, and for their altruism, we are truly grateful. Sadly, this can also sometimes spread such organizations too thin, leading to challenges in maintaining funding and volunteers by no fault of the organizations themselves.
We recognize that many peer counselors’ stakes in their groups outweigh any financial burdens caused by the unpaid time commitments. Yet for many would-be peer counselors, the burden represents an unjust and prohibitive barrier to involvement. This is especially true for the intensive training programs that these groups run during Opening Days. Prior to the UC’s grant, peer counselors in training were expected to foot the bill for a full week of dining expenses.
While we applaud the step forward that this grant represents, we doubt that $2,000, distributed over six organizations, is sufficient to completely remove any financial barriers to attending these training sessions. For this reason, we regret that the administration does not provide adequate funds for food and other expenses for some of the students who are most dedicated to the mental health of our campus.
The potential budgetary challenges the administration may face in funding peer counseling groups pales in comparison to the amount of effort—especially given the nature of the work—that these groups put in. Indeed, peer counseling is fundamentally different and more demanding than the work of many other student organizations that do not receive similar funding from Harvard.
Whereas it is appropriate for the UC to provide financial support for many of our student organizations, peer counseling groups are exceptionally deserving of help. The UC was right to provide funds for peer counseling groups and bring attention to this pressing need, but we hope to see the administration take on this responsibility in the future.
While there is always room for improvement in efforts to address mental health issues, peer counseling groups uniquely address mental health needs unmet on many other college campuses by focusing on different communities within the student body. Indeed, distinctions between and diversity among our peer counseling groups are among their strongest attributes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences decision Tuesday to adopt a new course schedule beginning in the fall of 2018 has left some students optimistic about the new timetable, while others lamented the end of school tradition.
Beginning in Fall 2018, FAS will implement a new course schedule with a built in 15-minute passing period to give students more time to travel to  the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s Allston campus, set to open in 2020. Perhaps most controversially, the 7-minute passing time known popularly as "Harvard Time" will no longer exist.
“I think in general it’ll be beneficial to the students because not only do we have 15 minutes between classes, but it’s beneficial to faculty because they can teach more,” Ching W. Sullivan ’20 said.
Others, such as Matthew L. Ybarra ’20 have been confused by the proposal.
“I don’t really understand the new plan,” Ybarra said. “I was reading through it and it just kind of seems inefficient. Like, why change a good thing?”
Allison S. Chang ’19 agreed.
“I think seven minutes is a good window of time. So I don’t really see a reason to mess with the system,” she said.
For some students, the change means a loss of a distinct Harvard custom.
“I guess it’s like a silly tradition and it’s been around for so long,” Alex C. Wang ’17 said. “I guess the change has been primarily made so people can go to Allston for the new campus, so that makes sense and I’m not offended by it. It’ll just take time to adjust.”
“I was very disappointed. I like Harvard time. It’s just nice. Also, it’s really unique to the school that we have it. And so it just feels like part of the schedule, and so it’s kind of weird to do away with it,” Emily S. Brother ’19 said.
In addition to the removal of “Harvard Time,” most classes will also be extended to 75 minutes in the new course schedule.
Johnny G. Powell ’20 said that the increased class times could require more student focus in class, but the increased time in-between classes could make it easier for students to arrive on time.
“I think that this should be good because it’s hard for me sometimes to get from the Science Center to the Barker Center because most of the time I will get there, late especially when classes go past the hour,” Powell said.
Powell also said he dislikes the potential increase in the number of evening classes because he prefers to keep his schedule similar to the one he had in high school.
Wayne Zhao ’17 expressed concerns about the uniform class length.
“They should definitely monitor that a little more, because for a lot of classes if you stretch some out to 75 minutes you might not have any benefits, and if you squeeze some to 75 minutes you might not get through enough material.”
Zhao said he thinks the new schedule will better prepare students for life after school, however.
“The real world doesn’t run on Harvard time,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has come under fire for rejecting a proposal for a summer program tailored towards low-income and first generation students, the leaders of the Undergraduate Council have announced plans to fund additional programming for freshmen during Opening Days.
At a meeting with the Student Advisory Committee of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said they hoped to help fund 89 affinity groups associated with the SAC.
“The notion is that we’ll give you the money to welcome students to your groups, such that the funding that you’re using for those programs now are not taken out of your regular budgets,” Khansarinia said.
While Sachee and Khansarinia said during their campaign they hoped to create freshmen “bridge programs” during Opening Days, those efforts came to the fore last week after Khurana rejected a plan with similar goals. At the UC’s meeting Sunday, Khurana discussed his decision not to approve a summer program for low-income and first generation freshmen.
Now, Sachee and Khansarinia are taking steps to aid first-years once the school year has started.
“We were all disappointed about the decision about the first year bridge program, but we understand the different factors going into that. And so one thing Yaz and I have been very keen on is us, as students, taking the challenge upon ourselves while we can,” added Khansarinia.
The UC leaders also announced their plans in a school-wide email.
“We know this is not a replacement for a comprehensive first-year bridge program, but it is a critical starting point,” the duo wrote late Wednesday.
During the meeting, the UC leaders said they hoped that their plan would motivate groups to plan more events for freshmen.
“Many of you guys have programs like a barbeque or some kind of meet and greet at the beginning of the year, but what we intend to do with this extra plot of money would be to encourage you to increase that programming,” Khansarinia said. “With this extra money, you can hopefully increase the length of that programming so perhaps go from a welcome lunch to an entire day of programming.”
Sachee noted that the plan would be to spread out programming over two weekends, so more freshmen would be able to attend multiple events.
There are plans in the budget to incentivize these groups to partner together in order to not spread the money too thin, according to Khansarinia.
“We have 89 programs in the SAC, and so if we divide up all this money between 89 different groups and each individual groups hold their own programming, that becomes a bit more difficult because the funding gets significantly diluted,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has requested that a trial jury decide the results of a lawsuit brought by a recent graduate alleging that the University mishandled her sexual assault complaint.
Alyssa R. Leader ’15 filed the suit in February 2016, arguing that Harvard responded with “deliberate indifference” to her sexual assault complaint when she was an undergraduate. In a filing on March 30, Harvard denied “each and every allegation” in Leader’s complaint. Two weeks ago, a federal court denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. 
“At the conclusion of [the Office for Dispute Resolution’s] investigation, the investigators concluded that Plaintiff’s allegations of harassment and retaliation were not substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence,” Harvard’s attorneys wrote in the filing.
Leader initially filed a sexual harassment complaint as an undergraduate in 2015, alleging that a male undergraduate, “John Doe 1,” sexually abused and harassed her during and after a dating relationship. Leader argued that the University did not properly respond to the complaint and violated anti-sex discrimination lawTitle IX.
Over the summer, the University filed several arguments against Leader’s case, and a Massachusetts district court dismissed three of Harvard’s four arguments in March. The court did rule in favor of dismissing Leader’s claim against Harvard for premises liability, which would mean that unsafe conditions on University property led to harm or increased risk for harm.
This case is not the first time Harvard’s compliance with Title IX has been called into question. In 2014, the United States Department of Education found the Law School in violation of Title IX, and the College’s compliance with Title IX is currently under investigation by the federal government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 6, 2017 at 1:21 p.m. 
Harvard will hold a competition to change the final line of “Fair Harvard,” the University’s 181-year-old alma mater, which has read “Till the stock of the Puritans die” since its composition in 1836.
Government professor Danielle S. Allen, co-chair of Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging, announced the plans to change the lyric at a three-hour event the task force held Wednesday in Sanders Theatre. Convened by University President Drew G. Faust in September, the committee is tasked with evaluating Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and recommend improvements.
The group is also launching a second competition for “a new musical variant" of the alma mater that could be performed as electronic, hip hop, or spoken word music. The traditional music would remain the official mode of performance for the song, but the new mode would be “preserved by the University as an endorsed alternative,” according to the group’s website—“The inspiration is 'Hamilton.' The point is to use your imagination,” it reads.
University affiliates can submit lyric and music variant submissions on the task force’s website through September, and winners will be announced in spring 2018.
Also at Wednesday’s event, the “Afternoon of Engagement on Inclusion and Belonging” featured remarks from Faust, stories from Harvard affiliates, and collaborative exercises designed to inform the task force’s future discussions.
In her welcoming remarks, Faust shared a story about receiving letters from young girls around the world after she became the University’s first female president.
“Diversity, inclusion, and belonging are fundamental to our missions and to our identity and essential for creating a better university, and the responsibility for that is one shared by students, faculty, and staff,” she said.
Individuals from across the University then took to the stage to discuss their personal experiences with “belonging.”
Kalan Chang, an administrator at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, shared his story about immigrating to the United States without knowing any English, and then working his way to an Extension School degree and his current position at Harvard.
Eden H. Girma ’18, the only undergraduate to speak, recalled participating in a protest at Primal Scream, a biannual naked run around Harvard Yard before the first day of finals. The protesters wanted to observe minute and a half of silence for black men killed by police, Girma said.
“Thinking back to that experience, with all of the emotions that I had, I can only see at the moment, that seems so clear to me, seeing two Harvards. One, a student body that felt so intrinsically implicated in the violence that was happening in the world, and another that seemed so blind to that,” Girma said. “Thinking retrospectively, I know there are so many nuances to this.”
Sophia Y. Lozano, assistant manager for Winthrop dining services and a member of the task force, said she was particularly touched by Girma’s speech.
“Being a minority, I can connect to a lot of the stories about you want to belong but you know you don’t,” she said. “As a woman being in the culinary field, when I first came in, it was a man’s world.”
For the latter part of the afternoon, attendees formed small groups to discuss prompts such as “share an experience where you or someone you know felt that they didn’t belong at Harvard” and “how can we bring Harvard closer to our aspirations?” Each group designated a “scribe” to take notes to submit to the task force’s website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Styling themselves as characters from "Harry Potter," a group of Harvard students has launched the "Resistance School," a four-session program designed to teach techniques for challenging President Donald Trump's administration.
Founded by former campaign staffers, organizers, and activists, the Resistance School aims to “sharpen the tools [necessary] to fight back at the federal, state, and local levels,” according to its website. The free sessions are open to the public and will be held throughout April at the Kennedy School as well as live-streamed from the Resistance School website. It is the latest in a series of efforts by Harvard students to resist Trump.
Likening itself to Dumbledore’s Army—the covert group from the Harry Potter series dedicated to battling Voldemort—the group has attracted widespread media attention, and all spots for its in-person sessions have already been filled.
Co-founder Joseph L. Breen, a student at the Kennedy School and the Law School, said the idea for the training program came after the election as students and professors discussed how they could best stand up to Trump.
“We thought about the resources that were available to us, and what we could add to the tremendous momentum of progressive activism. We felt like there were a lot of folks who wanted to get involved with political activism but didn't have the tools to do so,” Breen said.
Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer on History and Literature aand a lecturer on public policy at the Kennedy School, led the Resistance School’s first session Wednesday evening, delivering a lecture on “How to Communicate our Values in Political Advocacy.”
“Schools at their best are communities for critical thinking. Schools are places for intellectual exchange, for social transformation, and yes, when necessary, for political resistance,” McCarthy said at the session. “This is a movement moment.”
As of Wednesday night, over 35,000 people had viewed the live stream of McCarthy’s seminar on Facebook.
In the second session, Sara El-Amine, the former executive director of Obama’s advocacy arm, will teach “How to Mobilize and Organize our Communities.” Marshall L. Ganz, a senior Kennedy School lecturer, will teach the third: “How to Structure and Build Capacity for Action.” In the final session, recently-elected Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Michael A. Blake will speak on“How to Sustain the Resistance Long-Term.”
“I think that our democracy is experiencing a very serious threat at this moment with the Trump regime,” Ganz said. “For me it’s not just about resistance, it is about turning this into an opportunity to renew our politics. It’s for the future.”

The City of Cambridge has been awarded over $32,000 as a part of the state government’s annual Shannon Grant awards to fight organized criminal activity across the state.
The award, which totaled $5.7 million statewide, was distributed to 15 neighborhoods and 11 research organizations across Massachusetts. Cambridge’s award was part of a larger award to the Metro Mayors Coalition, a network consisting of Cambridge and thirteen other areas in the Greater Boston area.
Though gang violence is not as prevalent in Cambridge itself as in other areas of the state, Cambridge’s border with several densely populated urban areas makes the issue of gang recruitment one that concerns the Cambridge Police Department.
“We do acknowledge that there are neighborhood or designated locations that at-risk youth primarily associate with or identify with as their territory,” Jeremy Warnick, spokesperson for CPD, said. “So that’s really how we would describe gang activity in Cambridge and more so in the greater area.”
The city plans to use the grant money to stay one step ahead of gang recruitment and educate at-risk youth before they enter the juvenile justice system, as it is oftentimes difficult to get out of the system. As in past years, the police department will continue to cooperate with youth centers across the city. Additionally, the department plans to put a greater focus specifically on community arts centers.
“We’re being involved in the arts center’s teen media program, where they do everything from graffiti art to comic book design to DJ workshops,” Warnick said. “It’s the idea of keeping them distracted, keeping them busy, avoiding potentially engaging in any potential activity that may be detrimental to them and others.”
In addition to the youth programs, the police department also plans to use the grant to support their Hot Spot Patrol program. This unit evaluates data from the department to analyze where crime may be more prevalent.
According to the most recent Cambridge Police Annual Crime Report, roughly 21 percent of juvenile arrests in Cambridge occurred in the five neighborhoods that Harvard occupies. The Mid-Cambridge neighborhood—which encompasses Harvard Yard, parts of Central Square, and the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School—accounts for five percent of juvenile arrests. The largest percentage of juvenile arrests, 44 percent, occurred in East Cambridge, just north of MIT campus.
Around Harvard, organized crime has not traditionally been seen as prevalent as in other areas in Boston. According to Warnick, most of the crime seen around campus consists of petty larceny or theft. Earlier this semester, laptops and other valuables were stolen from dorm rooms in Lowell House.

As Harvard College seniors enjoy a burst of free time after handing in hundreds of senior theses, some have turned to developing new hobbies and visiting old friends in their final months as undergraduates.
Since March, seniors across dozens of undergraduate departments and degree programs have submitted theses after months of research, writing, and editing. Some concentrations, such as History and Literature and Social Studies, require students to hand in theses in the spring.
David M. Leeds ’17, one such History and Literature concentrator, said he is relieved to have “finished his biggest assignment of College” after handing in his thesis last month.
Although Leeds said he is still spending time on his other commitments and finalizing post-graduate plans, he is still enjoying the free time.
“I have been able to get involved again, after having to sort of shell off some of my extracurriculars commitments in the last couple weeks before I handed in my thesis,” Leeds said.
Some seniors said they are now able to spend time on new hobbies, ranging from quilting to meditation.
Sociology concentrator Ted J. White ’17 said he has spent many free hours working out, as well as socializing with friends.
“I’m trying to spend more time with people before I graduate, and now I also have more time to go to the gym,” he said.
Social Studies concentrator Chase A. Buchholz ’17, meanwhile, said he has taken on meditation in order to improve his mental health.
“I'm slowly getting into meditation—with some extra time just centering myself mentally is really helpful for rowing and for my own personal mental health.” Buchholz said. “It's been a really good outlet.”
And History and Science concentrator Jade Y. Moon ’17 has begun making quilts, which to her surprise, Moon says she enjoys.
“I have a friend who introduced me to quilting. I never thought I would be into it before, but now I have the time to try it and it's actually a lot of fun,” Moon said.
But some seniors are less intentional with their post-thesis schedules, such as Classics concentrator David F. Clifton ’17. Clifton said finishing his thesis was a “huge relief,” and that he has less concrete plans for the remainder of the semester.
“I suddenly have free time. I don’t even know what to do with my time, which is great,” he said.

McGill University Professor Daniel J. Levitin warned individuals of the dangers of entering a “post-truth” era and advocated for better decision-making models in the White House, the courts, and the media to preserve democracy in a Wednesday lecture at the Law School.
One of Levitin’s key concerns is the prevalence of “alternative facts” in the national dialogue. In order to have any kind of fruitful discussion, all members must agree on the underlying truth, according to Levitin.
“I just want to go on record repeating what many have already said that there is no such thing as alternative facts,” Levitin said. “It’s just the kind of nonsensical, Orwellian double-talk that we should be afraid of.”
Levitin argued that political polarization could lead to the destruction of critical discussions.
“The developments of the last three months, I think, have showed us that if we’re not careful, we might just set things back 400 years,” Levitin said. “I’m not trying to be overly dramatic here and I’m certainly not trying to be political.”
Levitin emphasized the advances made in thinking during the Enlightenment, and warned that “alternative facts” run counter to those developments. He suggested that public and private decision-making should be immune to “superstition and rumor and innuendo.”
“The whole point of the Age of Reason is we’re going to use evidence and evidence-based thinking is what’s under siege,” Levitin said. “It seems as though [politicians] are trying to get rid of evidence-based thinking entirely by comments that evidence doesn’t matter and the facts don’t matter.”
At the end of his talk, Levitin explained that evidence-based thinking is part of the solution. Since information has become more accessible with the advent of the Internet, educational institutions should also teach their students how to evaluate a source’s legitimacy rather than just accept the information contained in it, Levitin said.
Last month, Harvard University Libraries published an online guide to “fake news,” which drew criticism from conservative groups.
James K. Bursley, a graduate student in the Psychology Department who attended the lecture, questioned Levitin’s perspective.
“I think Dr. Levitin discussed what is currently a very fashionable and flashy topic without any sort of reference or understanding of the historical context in which this discussion ought to be situated,” Bursley said. “People like Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays very explicitly talked about the role of media being to manipulate public opinion in order to serve the interests of the elite.”
Still, Levitin rationalized that humility and curiosity can function as important safeguards of truth, quoting Voltaire, “Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.”

UPDATED: April 6, 2017 at 1:30 p.m.
Representatives from Harvard’s Title IX Office, the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response will begin meeting monthly in a new partnership aimed at bolstering Harvard's response to sexual assault.
As part of their new partnership, five representatives from the three offices—including newly-appointed Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill, Associate Title IX Officer Julia A. Sáenz, BGLTQ Office director Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, OSAPR director Alicia Oeser, and the College’s Title IX Coordinator Emily J. Miller—will meet monthly to give one another updates and plan events. These meetings will take place on a rotating schedule at the Title IX Office, the BGLTQ Office, or at OSAPR’s offices in the Smith Campus Center.
The three offices also plan to co-sponsor more programs in future, according to Merhill. In an interview Tuesday, all five administrators said they hoped their closer relationship will show students that issues addressed by the Title IX Office, the BGLTQ Office, and OSAPR are often intertwined.
“We understand that gender is a significant predictor of sexual violence and then gender inequity as well,” Oeser said. “To address that fully, holistically, it requires that we are intentionally incorporating our queer students, our queer community members.”
“I think individually our offices were doing this already, but now we’re saying, how do we make this visible to the community,” Oeser added.
The three agencies serve different but related functions on campus: the Title IX Office provides interim measures for students who report sexual assaults and offers training on gender equality law Title IX, while OSAPR offers counseling and sexual assault prevention resources. The BGLTQ Office works to support BGLTQ-identifying undergraduates.
The new, formalized partnership between the three offices is unprecedented in Harvard’s history, according to Miller. But administrators from the three offices have long wanted to develop a “stronger collaboration,” Scarborough said.
Oeser traced the idea’s inception to July 2014, when Harvard unveiled a new set of University-wide Title IX guidelines and procedures.
“It was a good signal that the queer community is part of this conversation and part of the way that the University is offering support,” Oeser said of Harvard’s Title IX policy. “Because that is a visible commitment… I think it naturally lends itself to the relationship between these three offices.”
Though administrators have discussed an inter-office collaboration since 2014, the idea came to fruition a few months ago, according to Oeser. Representatives from the three offices have met twice to date, once in February and once in March, she said.
Title IX, BGLTQ, and OSAPR officials did not seek permission from the University before formalizing their partnership, according to Merhill, but she and Oeser regularly communicated with Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell and Oeser’s supervisor, Harvard Chief of Nursing Maria Francesconi, about the idea. Merhill said both Newell and Francesconi were “overwhelmingly supportive” of the collaboration.
All five representatives from the three offices said they believe the present moment is ideal for launching a closer relationship, in part because the BGLTQ and Title IX Offices are in a state of administrative flux. Both offices recently underwent leadership changes; Scarborough became BGLTQ Director just a few months ago, in January.
On Tuesday, the University announced that the Title IX Office will be splitting into two distinct branches, and named Merhill and Sáenz as Title IX Officer and Associate Title IX Officer, respectively.
“I think it’s more of an opportunity, you know, with the central Title IX Office having some space to reorganize, with Sheehan [Scarborough] coming on the scene in the BGLTQ Office,” Miller said. “I think it really is that opportune moment.”
The Title IX Office, the BGLTQ Office, and OSAPR will co-sponsor their first initiative as formal partners later this month, according to deLuzuriaga. The event—though not yet finalized—will address issues of gender identity, and will form part of Harvard’s planned activities for Sexual Assault Awareness Month and BGLTQ Pride Month, both of which fall during April this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After freshman right-hander Grant Stone let go of his fifth pitch in Wednesday’s matinee with Massachusetts, it appeared as though the Harvard baseball team was picking up right where it left off from a weekend in which the Crimson dropped a pair of doubleheaders to Columbia and Penn. Stone’s offering to UMass senior second baseman Jon Avallone sailed over the left field fence at O’Donnell Field and gave the visitors a one-run edge. It was the fifth first inning run that Harvard had allowed in its last five games and bumped Stone’s season earned run average to 7.71.
“I think sometimes we need that little punch to get us going,” captain Josh Ellis said. “You’ve gotta score to win a baseball game anyway so it’s great to kind of get back on your toes but then also kind of get that fight in you early.”
However, the freshman settled in after the long ball, allowing just one walk and striking out four Minutemen in three innings of work. After Stone collected his second consecutive 1-2-3 frame, the Crimson offense answered the call. A five-run third inning propelled Harvard (11-12, 0-4 Ivy League) to a 7-3 win over UMass (6-14, 2-1 Atlantic Ten) on a brisk home opener that doubled as a Beanpot semifinal. With the win, the Crimson earned itself a date with Boston College in the Beanpot championship, which will be played on April 19 at Fenway Park. The Eagles topped Northeastern, 5-1, on Wednesday afternoon.
“I think our guys might’ve shown more today than we have throughout the year,” Harvard coach Bill Decker said. “We’ve come to the yard and played hard—we had a tough weekend and specifically didn’t play real well offensively—but I thought our guys came and played hard for one another today.”
The five-run third was a welcome addition for a Harvard offense that struggled to get timely hits over the weekend and managed just five runs over four games against the Lions and Quakers.
“It was huge,” Ellis said. “One thing that’s kind of been happening the last couple games is we’ve been getting hits with two outs, one hit, one hit, one hit, and we haven’t been able to put it together necessarily so it was nice to finally have a couple strung together and get some more support for our pitching staff.”
Senior shortstop Drew Reid got the hit party started with a one-out single. Captain Josh Ellis and sophomore center fielder Ben Skinner pushed the single streak to three, with Skinner’s one-bagger plating Reid. UMass starter Carter Knapek plunked freshman second baseman Quinn Hoffman to load the bases. Sophomore left fielder Trent Bryan found a gap to drive in two while sophomore first baseman put an exclamation point on the frame with a two-run triple.
With his team now holding a four-run advantage, freshman lefty JT Bernard was able to hold the Minutemen to one run over the fourth and fifth innings. Bernard’s changeup kept UMass hitters off-balance and the Douglasville, Ga., native struck out three while lowering his season earned run average to 2.08.
“He didn’t have a great feel for his breaking ball when he first went out there but he had command of his changeup,” Decker said. “His velocity is what it is but he’s that lefty you need to keep hitters off-balance, keep them guessing.”
The Minutemen got to within two runs after freshman right fielder Nolan Kessinger doubled to bring home senior designated hitter Mike Geannelis. After tip-toeing his way out of any additional damage in the sixth, senior right-hander Matt Hink shut down UMass in his second inning of work and his offense followed suit by removing any doubt about the final result.
In the home half of the seventh, Ellis picked up his second hit of the day, moved to second on a bunt by Skinner, and was driven home on a double by Hoffman. The freshman second baseman scored to push the Harvard lead to four on a Bryan sac fly. From there, it was freshman right-hander Hunter Bigge who slammed the door on the Minuteman offense. The Los Gatos, Calif., native retired five of the seven batters he faced and did not have a UMass player get past first base.
It was the second time that the Crimson has beaten the Minutemen this season as Harvard topped UMass, 8-2, in Port Charlotte, Fla., over spring break. The four arms that the Crimson relied on on Wednesday combined to pitch a grand total of zero innings for Decker last season. Stone, Bernard, and Bigge were all high school seniors at this point last year while Hink spent his first three years on campus as a first baseman.
“Awesome, no question,” Decker said of the pitching performance. “We were trying to get five out of [Stone and Bernard]. Matty got us through the seventh and Bigge threw the ball with conviction and that’s the guy we need on the back end to do something like that.”
Harvard’s bottom third of sophomore John MacLean, Reid, and Ellis combined for five of the Crimson’s nine hits on the afternoon. Harvard’s last appearance in the Beanpot final came in 2014, when it won the title. The last time that the Crimson played a championship at Fenway Park was in 2011.
“It’s awesome,” Ellis, the only member of the team from the Boston area, said of the opportunity to play in a Beanpot final for the first time. “I’m so excited, longtime Sox fan. Playing at the cathedral of Boston is going to be special. It’s been a few years since we’ve taken it, so it’s exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHICAGO — Across Division I men’s hockey, no senior class has come close to matching the production of Harvard’s most grizzled veterans.
In 35 games this season, the Crimson’s seven seniors have combined for 191 points—39 more than the nation’s next best collection of fourth-years, and 78 more than the same Harvard septuplet just a year ago.
The numbers don’t lie. For the 2016-17 edition of the Harvard Crimson, seniority rules. Netminder Merrick Madsen, left-winger Ryan Donato, and blue-liner Adam Fox have done well to champion their respective class years, but it is Harvard’s seniors who provide this team with its pulse.
But co-captain Alexander Kerfoot remembers a time in January when Harvard’s heart skipped a beat, only to be replaced with a buzz.
Each Crimson senior felt the vibration—not the good kind. The coaching staff had sent a text to each member of its eldest class. No one else.
“Obviously when you get a text from the coaches saying, ‘Can you guys all meet before practice?,’ it’s never usually a good thing,” Kerfoot said.
Everyone knew what was coming. At one time Harvard was 11-2-1, but the tires had fallen off for the third consecutive January. Only this time, the losses were stunners.
Days after rising to a program-record No. 2 in the national polls, the Crimson suffered an astonishing 4-0 defeat to a 3-19-1 RPI team that had not beaten an opponent with a winning record—besides Harvard—since January 2016. The next night, Union shut out the Crimson for all but 10 seconds of game time, and the following Tuesday, Dartmouth lit up the Cambridge icemen for eight goals.
Harvard did manage to rebound with three points the following weekend. But a home win over Brown hardly counts. And a 1-1 tie with Yale just doesn’t cut it. Thus, the private meeting was held.
Senior defenseman Clay Anderson remembers what the staff had to say: “‘Guys, do you want to just go away in the night? Or do you want to actually do something with the season?’”
“At that point, we very well could’ve just gone .500 the rest of the year and lost the second round of the ECAC playoffs or whatever,” Anderson acknowledged. “But we sat down, looked in the mirror, and actually realized that we had something special. And if we wanted to do something with it, it had to be now.”
***
Fast forward two months.
Standing before senior Devin Tringale in a now-barren Herb Brooks Arena, a reporter begins rattling off Harvard’s accomplishments in front of the co-captain: “Just five losses on the year, Ivy League, ECAC, Beanpot, I mean how special has this year been?”
The fourth-line forward was already beaming. “Just hearing you say that brings a smile to my face,” he said.
It’s a good thing Tringale selected hockey as his sport of choice, not poker, because the Medford, Mass., native wears his team on his sleeve. And if somehow you can’t tell, don’t worry. Because he’ll literally let you know.
“He’s very vocal,” Kerfoot said. “Not just in the locker room, but on the ice, in between periods, on the bench. He’s just very positive at all times on the bench. I think that’s something that you really need. It can get deflating at times if things aren’t going your way, and [it’s important] to have that calming presence on the bench who’s always positive and always upbeat.”
That’s Tringale in a nutshell. He’s only got three goals, and he’s only got three assists, but he’s just as much a part of Harvard’s current 18-game unbeaten streak as anyone else in the locker room.
Tringale arrived on campus amidst an era of Harvard Hockey not far removed from turmoil, as the Crimson had posted just one winning season in the five years prior to the arrival of the Class of 2017. But persuaded by the program’s rich history and the caliber of the guys coming in around him, Tringale saw an opportunity to compete.
“We all came to this program knowing we could be national contenders,” Tringale said.
Well, he was right. Since a disappointing 10-17-4 freshman campaign, Harvard’s most veteran class has now advanced to three consecutive NCAA Tournaments and is set to compete in the Frozen Four for the first time since 1994.
These are the rest of the ’17ers who made it happen.
***
For the third season in a row, the Harvard captainship is shared by two members of the Crimson. There’s Tringale. And then there’s that skinny kid from Matthews.
About to take a practice conditioning test prior to the 2013-14 season, Tringale and a handful of teammates had cut through the Yard on their walk to the Bright. And along the way, Tringale caught his first real glimpse of now co-captain Alexander Kerfoot right outside Matthews—one that still gets a laugh out of Tringale to this day.
“I guess I hadn’t met them until now,” Kerfoot recalled. “I was kind of a smaller kid, wasn’t super built up…. But they were all dressed up in their gear heading down to the rink.”
“And I was just playing spikeball.”
These days, Kerfoot probably spends a little less time around the trampoline. And now three-plus years removed from their interesting first encounter, Kerfoot and Tringale are now both co-captains and roommates.
Therefore, it’s not considerably surprising that the two share several things in common. For instance, with the pieces Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 had begun to put in place prior to the duo’s arrival, Kerfoot also believed that he’d have an opportunity to contend for championships donning Crimson.
That belief stemmed from Donato making the trek to Vancouver—Kerfoot’s hometown—to watch the promising center play an exhibition game in the British Columbia Hockey League. The skipper arrived bearing blueprints detailing prospective renovations to the Bright, but those hardly mattered to Kerfoot. An opportunity to play right away paired with an opportunity to contend was already more than enough.
But here’s where Kerfoot and Tringale differ. Throughout the year, Tringale has spoken at length about moving on without a guy by the last name Vesey. Kerfoot, on the other hand, knows such a guy that hasn’t gone anywhere.
In fact you’d be hard pressed to find a bigger fan of Kerfoot than Jake Vesey, one of Jimmy’s youngest cousins. Despite Jimmy jumping to the pro ranks, Jake—according to Kerfoot—has been a spectator for just about every Harvard game this year, including the East Regional final in Providence, R.I., and the ECAC championship game in Lake Placid, N.Y.
“He’s been awesome, he’s a big fan of the team,” Kerfoot said. “There were a couple times last year when he sent Jimmy a text. It would be videos that his dad would actually send, and he would say, ‘Hey Kerf, good luck this weekend. Going to be rooting for you. And then at the end of it, he’d say, ‘Oh yeah, Jimmy good luck too!’”
Unfortunately, Jake will not be in Chicago for the Frozen Four, as he’ll be spending the weekend in Florida. But that didn’t stop the youngster from trying to sneak his way into the Windy City.
“He was actually pretty bummed,” Kerfoot said. “He was asking if I could put him in my hockey bag for him to come.”
***
If Jake managed to sneak his way into Kerfoot’s bag, senior defenseman Clay Anderson would have probably been the first to know. Because if there’s anything Anderson does as consistently as he mans the blue line, it’s that on every road trip, he packs all of Harvard’s hockey bags onto the bus.
“I just get frustrated when other people try and do it because they’re not good at it,” Anderson says with a laugh. “Just trying to keep things efficient.”
In a way, Anderson’s role with the equipment mirrors his actual role on the hockey team. As he himself has admitted, “you kind of fly under the radar.”
One season after earning a career-high +9 rating over 34 games from the blue line, Anderson has blown that mark out of the water. In large part due to his puck-moving presence on Harvard’s second power-play unit, the senior d-man is +21 on the year—putting him in a tie with teammate John Marino for the seventh-best mark in the country among defensemen.
Not too shabby for a guy on a third pairing. But even as a member of Harvard’s headline-grabbing senior class, Anderson continues to repel the spotlight. However, as a defenseman—the only one remaining in his class no less—the Omaha, Neb., native understands the nature of the media beast.
“You just come in and do your job,” Anderson said. “Do your own thing, and you let the forwards get all the glory.”
These kind of comments illustrate how Anderson presents himself as a realist. Perhaps that’s why his recollection of the recruitment process sounds a little different from that of his classmates.
For starters, Anderson doesn’t claim to remember every last detail from his first meeting with Coach Donato. “I think he took me on a car ride,” the d-man guesses.
As for his early aspirations, Anderson wasn’t thinking about national championships or Frozen Fours for long.
“I definitely thought we could do something, but after that freshman year I kind of realized, no matter how much talent you have, it’s going to take much more to win games,” Anderson said. “So I don’t think a national title was on our thoughts. I think it was ‘what are we going to do,’ how are we going to start winning games?”
“Not until this year was there really any forethought about going to the Frozen Four or doing the things that we have,” he added.
The latter statement is a bit more surprising than the first given Harvard’s three consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, but it hardly dilutes the notion that Anderson’s take is refreshing. There’s no denying that this class has been at the heart of the resurgence of Harvard Hockey; but there’s also no denying that there were legitimate kinks along the road to revival.
When this season finally comes to an end, one can only wonder if Harvard will be able to replace its star bag-packer. Anderson does hope to continue playing hockey at the professional level, but perhaps he can be had back for the right price.
“They might have to hire me on the staff.”
***

If it were up to Brock Malone, Harvard’s Assistant Director of Athletic Communications, Anderson would certainly get the job. But alas, he probably doesn’t have the power to extend such an offer.
One offer Malone did extend, however, was one to senior forward Phil Zielonka: an opportunity to be in a television spot with ESPN’s John Buccigross and also devour chicken parm.
“It was actually very, very good, I’ve gotta say,” said Zielonka, incapable of refusing such a proposition.
At season’s outset, Zielonka stood no chance of having his dinner nationally televised. The 5’11” lefty was not listed among Harvard’s top 12 forwards, and the Montreal native hadn’t played in a game since Feb. 8, 2016.
Yet, players continued to rave about the forward’s specific skill set—primarily his lightning-quick shot. Zielonka wasn’t ready to confirm a rumor that he’s scored more goals in practice over four years than any of his teammates, but he did quip, “hopefully, I’m definitely up there.”
At the beginning of February, Zielonka’s golden opportunity arose. After half a season of Coach Donato telling the senior to stay ready, in-practice injuries to junior Seb Lloyd and freshman Frederic Gregoire opened the door for Zielonka to make his return to the lineup for good. He hasn’t left the third line since, and subsequently, he hasn’t been on the ice for a Harvard loss (15-0-0).
“We honestly kind of forgot what it feels like to lose,” Zielonka said. “And that can be a really good thing because we’re playing with a ton of confidence. But at the end of the day, we know that the next game we lose, our season’s over.”
***
Zielonka and Buccigross didn’t eat their parm alone. Also present to join in on the fun was Luke Esposito, a representative of Harvard’s final key group of seniors—the Crimson second line.
This second line has a plethora of names. Coach Donato often uses the term “Line 1B.” This publication has once referred to the trio as “The Three Amigos.” A few fans have even concocted “The Kirkland Line” as a descriptor.
The latter two labels stem from the fact that Esposito and his classmates Sean Malone and Tyler Moy are more than just linemates. They’re roommates.
At the outset of the season, all three amigos repeatedly pointed to their chemistry as a potential predictor of success. And considering they’ve logged 122 points this year, they might’ve been onto something.
Looking back, however, it’s somewhat difficult to fathom how three skaters from such divergent backgrounds wound up on the ice together in a place like Cambridge.
For starters, Moy never played for a school prior to Harvard. He grew up in San Diego, a place where ice wasn’t exactly the city’s most accessible commodity. To some degree, Esposito can relate. Living in South Carolina until he was 10, the forward stuck to roller skates until leaving the Palmetto state.
Later on, once he had established himself as an ice skater, Esposito was just about ready to commit to Princeton. He hadn’t heard much from Harvard, but before making a final decision, he decided to call Coach Donato on a whim. Sure enough, Donato answered the bell. The coach flew out to watch Esposito play, determined he’d be a fit, and the rest is history.
Meanwhile, as a native of a hockey city in Buffalo, N.Y., Malone had a much more straightforward path to collegiate hockey. And in 2013, another potential path emerged for the senior—one to professional hockey. Because Malone’s hometown Sabres selected him in the NHL Draft.
After bouncing around from team to team, program to program, and then playing two seasons with Harvard, Moy joined Malone’s company in 2015 when the Nashville Predators spent a sixth-round pick on the budding forward.
Of course, that leaves Esposito.
“Getting drafted for a lot of guys, myself included, was a dream,” said Esposito, who acknowledged that his progression was a little slower than for other guys. “You always envision yourself going first round with the jersey and everything.”
“There certainly is a chip on your shoulder when you’re playing other guys who are drafted, and you believe you can prove yourself over them,” he added. “But I’ve never taken it personally. Obviously you just want to look forward and look to prove yourself.”

“Guys, do you want to just go away in the night, or do you want to actually do something with the season?"
Esposito isn’t the only member of the Crimson who’s played with a chip on his shoulder. Just about every member of Harvard’s senior class has played with something to prove this year. And now that they’ve arrived on college hockey’s grandest stage, it appears they’ve made their point.
“People thought this would be a little bit of a down year, and we wanted to prevent that,” Tringale said. “A bunch of guys stepped up and allowed for that to happen.”
Now, just three seasons removed from the current seniors’ 10-win campaign, Harvard stands two wins away from hitting 30 victories—and of course, bringing home a national championship.
“There’s definitely a big sense of pride in our senior class, especially to be part of this transformation,” Tringale said. “To bring Harvard Hockey back to where it was back in the late ’80s and early ’90s, it’s a special feeling and something that we’re very proud of.”
“These guys are my brothers for life,” Moy said. “To have this kind of experience is something we’ve dreamed about for a long time now, and I think to have that manifest itself into a national championship would be one of the greatest experiences of our lives.”

MARISA ROMEO, ATTACKER, WOMEN’S LACROSSE
Guiding Harvard on Sunday to a 3-0 winning record in the Ivy League was senior captain and attacker Marisa Romeo. In the away match against Dartmouth College, the Crimson defeated the Big Green in an exhilarating 17-12 victory. Romeo led the Harvard offense with five goals, seven points, and two assists. The Syracuse, N.Y native’s prolific game matched her season high record of scoring and points against Yale on March 4 and brings her to a total of 35 goals this season.
A few days prior on Mar. 28th, in a tight 10-9 loss to Stanford University, Romeo recorded her seventh hat trick of the season along with posting five points. The Syracuse, N.Y. led the Crimson offense with three goals, seven shots, six of those shots on goal, as well as leading with two assists.
Overall, the senior captain currently leads the Crimson squad in goals, points, assists, and shots on goal this season, with 35 goals, 49 points, 14 assists, and 59 shots on goal in the 10 games the team has played.

GABBY THOMAS, SPRINTER, WOMEN’S TRACK AND FIELD

The past weekend, Harvard Track and Field sent some of its players to Gainesville, Flor. for the Florida Relays. On Friday Mar. 31, sophomore sprinter Gabby Thomas continued her record breaking season with a new school record in the 100 meter dash. The new Crimson school record of 11.24 seconds placed Thomas in third place overall at the relays.
The Florence, Mass. native went on to claim a victory in the 200 meter dash, nearly breaking her personal record of 22.47 seconds with a time of 22.60 seconds.
Thomas also excelled in team events, running in the Harvard’s 4x400 meter relay team that recorded a top-10 school time and finished fourth in the relays with a time of 3:39.35 to qualify the Crimson for the final.
The following day on Saturday, the 4x400 meter relay squad competed in the finals. Freshman pentathlete Zoe Hughes, freshman sprinter Karina Joiner, senior sprinter Jade Miller, and Thomas recorded a time of 3:37.43, placing the Crimson on the podium in third place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHICAGO — “Tread carefully in the Midwest when you come with your coastal biases,” warns Crimson phenomenon Nick Worth ’87. “You never know what you might step into.”
Way back when, the NCAA Men’s Hockey Tournament forced teams like Harvard to enter the belly of the beast for its games. And sometimes the Tournament even forced Crimson writers to do the same.
Just ask Worth, the man behind one of The Crimson’s most well-circulated stories to date. The last time Harvard met Minnesota-Duluth—its Frozen Four opponent tonight at the United Center—in the NCAA Tournament, the year was 1985, and Harvard had to travel right into the heart of Duluth. As did Worth, The Crimson’s men’s hockey writer of the era.
Originally, two opponents were just supposed to play hockey. A quarterfinal series between the two teams would determine who moved on to the stage of the tournament we now call the Frozen Four. But the sideshow that ensued back in 1985 ranks among one of the wildest and wackiest events in the history of both Harvard Hockey and The Crimson.
Worth, who in 1985 went by Nick Wurf, agrees.
“You don’t grow up thinking you’re going to be the villain,” he said this week. “And I turned out to be one.”
The madness started with stickers. Upon arriving in Duluth on March 20, 1985, Worth couldn’t help but see them everywhere. “UMD #1” was plastered on everything from businesses to cars to private homes.
“You half expect people to have them strapped to their pets,” joked Worth in his infamous Crimson piece titled “Bulldog Hockey Mania: The Only Show in Town.”
Worth was startled by the differences he saw between Cambridge and Duluth, specifically when it came to the importance each granted to college hockey. He admitted that lack of on-campus support for the Harvard hockey team was “sometimes frustrating.” But in this foreign land where hockey ruled supreme, he wrote that he found it “pathetic to see a town so consumed over so little.”
The story ran in the Thursday edition of The Crimson, and was quickly discovered in Cambridge by the late Joe Wright ’85, a Duluth native eager to read a story he had found involving his hometown Bulldogs. As it turned out, Wright wasn’t a fan.
Wright contacted the News-Tribune & Herald in Duluth, which received permission from The Crimson—then staffed by current CNN President Jeff Zucker ’86—to reprint on Friday what would soon become known in Duluth simply as “The Article.”
Worth was awoken Friday morning by a call from a TV reporter. Unaware that his article had been reprinted, Worth agreed to do an interview. “You don't have to ask me twice to be on TV,” he wrote.
When the reporter arrived at Worth’s hotel room, Worth commended her for finding his article in The Crimson. Only then was the truth revealed.
“It was reprinted, [and The Crimson’s managing editor] didn’t think much of it—he certainly didn’t contact me in Duluth to let me know,” Worth recalled. “Of course he would’ve had to call my hotel. There was no other way he could’ve gotten in touch with me back in 1985. He certainly didn’t do that, so I was blindsided.”
The story quickly garnered the attention of the entire city—home to almost 100,000 citizens and of course, two hockey teams.
"When I got up, I was alone in the house, except for the dog,” UMD coach Mike Sertich said. “And the dog was barking at the newspaper."
Harvard coach Bill Cleary ’56 was no happy camper either. After Worth finished collecting his interviews with a Crimson contingent Friday, Cleary pulled the sophomore aside—something he had never done before—and according to Worth said the following:
“We were going to sneak up on these guys, and you blew it for all of us. Now I’ve got to get up and apologize for you, and you know better than that.”
Cleary could not be reached for comment.
“He made me feel about six inches tall, which I completely deserved,” Worth continued. “He said it in more of a fatherly way than anything else. I looked up to Bill, so I was really disappointed that I’d let him down because he was a good guy trying to get things done.”
Harvard did wind up being swept in the series, but of course, hardly anyone truly believes that Worth had an impact on the outcome. In fact, future Hobey Baker winner Lane MacDonald ’89, who was a freshman on the 1985 Harvard team, thought the atmosphere stemming from the fiasco was great.
“While it gave them something to rally around, it didn’t change the outcome of the game,” MacDonald said. “It made it fun because they were really into it. It’s like going to Cornell and playing. When the opposing fans are really into it, it creates for a fun environment.”
The crowd pulled out every stop. Chants of “Who’s Nick Wurf?”. Messages on the electronic scoreboard. Even sign content generated straight from a thesaurus: “Nick Wurf is Uncouth.”
“There was about one full section of people at our game at Duluth that year who were wearing pink polo shirts with the collars turned up making fun of us,” tacked on a chuckling MacDonald.
“It was entirely surreal,” Worth said. “I couldn’t believe that I had genuinely become the focus of attention for a community and a lightning rod for all their frustrations.”
For Worth, the experience didn’t end there. The sophomore was clocked for doing 45 in a 30 that weekend, prompting The News-Tribune & Herald to run a front page story entitled “Harvard writer contributes to Duluth economy.” The booking also provided The Harvard Lampoon, and its leader Conan O’Brien ’85, an opportunity to get involved.
“Conan was a clever guy,” Worth said. “They stole The [Crimson’s presidential] caricatures, we couldn’t find them, and I think they eventually turned up at the Duluth Police Department, which was of course not super keen to send them back to The Crimson, which was not the most popular institution for the [DPD].”
Tonight’s latest Harvard-Duluth installment likely won’t generate the same sorts of storylines it did in 1985. And that’s probably for the better. But maybe if we’re lucky, we’ll still be able to see a sign that reads “Nick Wurf is Uncouth.”
