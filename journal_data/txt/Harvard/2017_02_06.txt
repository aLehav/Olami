After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 26, students and members of the Harvard community filled the Carpenter Center for the debut of Katy Grannan’s film, “The Nine.” Grannan is a photographer and filmmaker who lives and works in the Bay Area. Prior to her most recent work, she produced a short film titled “Are You Listening?”. Made before the 2016 presidential election, the video is a compilation of clips that Grannan captured while travelling across America, overlaid with narration by Cherry Jones. First published on The New Yorker website in late October, the film aimed to take a temperature of American attitudes leading up to the election, through the narratives and visual scenes.
For her most recent film, Granna examines an area in California’s Central Valley. South Nine Street, also known as the Nine, is depicted as a center of deterioration of society. In the film, Grannan provides a look into the lives of residents of the Nine, who are not so far estranged as their world seems to be.
“I felt their stories needed to be heard,” Grannan said. “It’s part of an invisible America that’s all around us. It’s part of us.”
Grannan, who grew up down the street from Harvard in Arlington, Massachusetts, embraced the debut of her film near her roots.
“It’s pretty special to be so close to home. A lot of my family is here, old friends, neighbors,” she said.
“The Nine” is Katy Grannan’s first feature film, as she previously worked as a photographer. Her photographs have been in exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
As for the transition between still photography to cinematography, Grannan said that she’s welcomed the challenge. After so many years in photography, she stressed that she wanted to be a beginner again. Still, many stylistic choices in the film reveal how she has preserved her eye from photography.
“As a still photographer, I thought it’d be really interesting to think about what kind of still photograph would arise from the videos,” Grannan said. “The still mundane moments, the normalcy, almost, was what was so important.”
In fact, her first inspiration for the film came from working on photography projects in the Central Valley. She said that she’s always tried to figure out a way to represent the relationships between the people that she photographs, and those relationships evolved into a story she felt compelled to tell.
But Grannan’s exploration of the population extends to more than just her photography experiences in Modesto. Her oldest childhood friend passed away right around the time the idea for the film was starting to come together.
“Right before she died, she was invisible. And it was just so tragic, my friend, who was so smart, young, beautiful. She deserves to be remembered,” Grannan said.
One audience member, who identified herself as an Amherst student hailing originally from Modesto, addressed Grannan during the Q&A session inquiring about Grannan’s experience with Modesto outside of the Nine.
Though Grannan said that location was an integral part of the film, she added, “This is not a portrait of Modesto. This is about an invisible community, this is about all over, a group of people who are throwing themselves away, killing themselves and each other.”
Grannan dedicated the film to a number of residents of the Nine who have died. She mentioned that she’s received reviews from critics who say that the film has no resolution—which is the very heart of the problem that she’s addressing.
“It’s almost an American view,” Grannan said. “We want to resolve everything, we want it all to be okay. But ‘The Nine’ doesn’t resolve itself. We really have to look at it and understand that. It’s who we are.”

“A Separation” begins with an ending—or at the very least, a partial one. In Katie Kitamura’s latest novel, the unnamed narrator agrees to separate from her unfaithful husband Christopher in an arrangement known only to them. It is one secret of many in a story rife with affairs and murder. But secrets are not the only concern for Kitamura. Instead the author defies potential genre conventions to weave a story that carefully touches upon the unanswered questions surrounding grief, love, and duty. Though certain narrative techniques, such as ambiguous dialogue and potentially unreliable narration, might deter some readers, “A Separation” nevertheless handles its subject matter with grace and integrity. Kitamura’s newest work might not appeal to everyone’s tastes, but for those willing to engage deeply with its content, it proves to be a thoughtful and ingenious read.
Within the first few pages, Kitamura propels the book’s narrative into mystery when the narrator’s mother-in-law calls inquiring about Christopher’s whereabouts. Tasked with locating him, the narrator journeys to a hotel in Gerolimenas, a remote Greek village where he was last seen, to find him and finalize the divorce. What she discovers is not Christopher, however, but enigmas surrounding the village residents and her marriage’s complicated nature. Yet while Christopher’s disappearance is a source of puzzlement, Kitamura pulls the story away from the suspenseful thriller that it could be. Instead she chooses to weave a psychological tale that focuses on the narrator’s observations and conflicts.
The decision is a gamble—an excursion into a protagonist’s psyche might read as less urgent or engaging than a work overflowing with action—but “A Separation” is a novel defined by technical and narrative risks that end in mixed results. Kitamura refuses to use quotation marks when writing dialogue, meshing different speakers into one paragraph and sometimes forgoing attributions. “The waiter brought my drink. Would I be needing anything else? No, I was fine. Let me adjust the umbrella, the sun is very hot. Before I could stop him he had dragged the heavy stand several feet.” So Kitamura describes a conversation between the narrator and a waiter—the format typical of the rest of the novel. By refusing to define the start and end of each character’s speech, Kitamura requires diligence and attentiveness from the reader. In the same scene, she fluidly incorporates the narrator’s fantasy of Christopher having an affair with the hotel worker into her interactions with the waiter. “I ordered a drink. It was hot, sweat pooled in the crevice of my collarbone. He grasped her wrist, pressing first his thumb and then his forefinger against her skin,” the narrator says. Such a move can either alienate or engross. Yet despite the potentially negative effect, Kitamura’s style is commendable for its unabashed embrace of experimentation and ambiguity.
In fact, ambiguity pervades the entire novel. The first person makes it easier to see the other characters through the narrator’s eyes, which are potentially biased or faulty filters. “I became more and more convinced that nothing concrete had taken place between them, she seemed to me more like a lovestruck teenager than a scorned lover,” the narrator notes, as she eats dinner with a woman she originally suspected was her husband’s mistress—her judgment here, however, is quickly proven wrong. The scene reveals the narrator’s fallacy in evaluating people, one that might affect views of all the characters that she describes. Such moments impair the trust between the narrator and reader, and often lead to confusion and uncertainty. As with Kitamura’s writing style, this choice might alienate certain readers. Yet the tactic is also masterful. The reading experience becomes an extension of the ambiguity within the text itself in which uncertain infidelities, conflicting emotions, and questionable motives all play a role. And by allowing ambiguity to pervade the writing style, the narrative voice, and the plot, Kitamura emphasizes the idea more powerfully—it is prevalent, found everywhere. The novel feels raw, completely honest about the ways in which the world’s interactions are often messy and difficult to interpret. This characteristic is what ultimately elevates “A Separation” into must-read territory. The thematic gains outweigh the potential turn-offs.
The novel ends unconventionally. Many questions remain unresolved, and many of the narrator’s beliefs are shattered without a clear replacement. It is a conclusion befitting a novel that revels in uncertainties, both within the story and within the reading experience. “A Separation” might strike some as impenetrable, difficult even, but take a moment to immerse yourself in Kitamura’s latest melody—unpack the narrator’s complex psychology, consider the language’s cadence and individuality, revel in its themes of love and loss—and you’ll find a work that is provocative and impossible to forget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After violent protests raised concerns of student safety, administrators at UC Berkeley canceled a planned event featuring controversial far-right speaker Milo Yiannopoulos last Wednesday. “150 masked agitators” interrupted an otherwise peaceful protest, causing $100,000 of damage to the university’s campus. We commend UC Berkeley administrators for effectively and efficiently handling this situation.
While the incident has been framed as a battle over free speech on UC Berkeley’s liberal campus, it is important to distinguish intellectual diversity from hate speech on college campuses. It is imperative that college students gain a wide range of perspectives and evidence-based ideas to continue challenging their own opinions and worldviews, but universities should foster this intellectual growth by inviting principled conservatives to provide educational experiences for their students—not polemicists such as Yiannopoulos who hold little substance behind their contrarian views.
Yiannopoulos does not deserve to be granted the platform of a university campus to espouse his hateful beliefs. Institutions of higher education pride themselves on generating new knowledge and challenging old beliefs for the purposes of advancing our understanding of the world. Furthermore, these institutions are built on the principle of evidence-based research. In contrast, Yiannopoulos appears to challenge others’ beliefs simply for the sake of being a contrarian, and he does so with little tenability for his claims. Yiannopoulos is little more than a racist, sexist, and anti-semite who encourages hate and fear rather than intellectual thought.
There is strong precedent for believing that Yiannopoulos poses a tangible threat to the safety and well-being of university students. For example, in a sold-out talk at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee last December, Yiannopoulos singled out Adelaide K. Kramer, a transgender student at the university, by projecting her face on a large screen and proceeding to mock her in front of a packed crowd of laughing students. Following the incident, Kramer wrote to the chancellor of UW, “Do you know what it’s like to be in a room full of people who are laughing at you as if you’re some sort of perverted freak, and how many of them would have hollered at me (or worse) if I was outed? Do you know what this kind of terror is?” The far-right speaker’s views are incredibly hateful towards students who deserve to feel welcome on their college campuses. Yiannopoulos has proven multiple times that he is a significant threat to specific students. This alone should be more than enough for administrators to bar him from campuses in the first place.
In the midst of the debates of free speech and intellectual diversity, the irony of President Donald J. Trump’s Twitter responses is especially disheartening for student protesters across this country. Following the Berkeley campus protests, President Trump tweeted, “If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?” Moving forward, advocates of “free speech” must work to also expand their selective view of the constitution and recognize that the Berkeley student protesters who were peaceful were exercising their first amendment rights. President Trump’s immediate threats to pull federal funds from a public university due to student protests must be taken as a serious infringement on one of America’s most powerful democratic rights.
Members of Harvard should think twice before inviting speakers such as Yiannopoulos to our campus. Granting these figures a platform at our universities only serves to further legitimize their untenable, hateful claims and poses a threat to fellow classmates. Milo Yiannopoulos and other members of the alt-right have no place on college campuses. Harvard College's mission statement "seeks to identify and to remove restraints on students’ full participation"; the identification and prevention of hate speech is critical in this mission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What an insult it would be.
That was the thought running through my mind as I watched Khizr Khan give his speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. What an insult it would be to this man’s son, Captain Humayan Khan, who died fighting on behalf of our country in Iraq, and to his family that made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation and its ideals. What an insult it would be to them if we elect as President someone who has suggested that all those sharing Mr. Khan’s religious background are undeserving of the opportunities afforded by his son’s selflessness.
In hindsight, perhaps I should not have been surprised by the slap in the face the American electorate delivered to the Khans and all other Muslim-American and immigrant military families on Nov. 8. As long as the United States has existed, its success has rested on the willingness of people who enjoy only partial inclusion in its political community to lay down their lives in defense of it. From the African-Americans who fought with Massachusetts militias at Lexington and Concord to the Navajo code talkers of the Second World War, American wars have been won by soldiers whose citizenship and humanity were not fully recognized by their government or many of their fellow Americans.
Sometimes, the devotion of these men and women has affected the political trajectory of the nation. As former United States Senator and World War II Medal of Honor winner Daniel Inouye put it in an interview for a PBS documentary, “One of the most important results of [World War II] was to begin the process of integration.”
Undoubtedly, the World War II-era service of African-Americans helped jumpstart the Civil Rights movement, just as the service of Mexican-Americans was a prelude to the landmark case Hernandez v. Texas, which extended Fourteenth Amendment protections to that community, and as the sacrifices made by Japanese-Americans helped lead to eventual reparations for their internment during WWII.
But “begin” is the key verb in Senator Inouye’s recollection. One favorite trope of those who have argued against greater military integration is that the perils of the battlefield make the armed forces an especially dangerous venue for so-called “social engineering.” In reality, the opposite is true. War has a tendency of underscoring common humanity, ugly and positive. A Mexican-American World War II veteran in the same PBS program described the Marines as being “like a mini-United States…where you got Jews, you got Italians, you got Indians—and they all learn to live together.”
While military life can adapt to diversity with relative success, however, social and political life outside of the armed forces has found it more difficult. One need only note the lag between victories for military integration and victories for social integration, or look at recent protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline and police killings of unarmed black men, to see the limits of military service as a primary vehicle of social integration.
For me, this issue is particularly personal because it implicates the life of my grandfather, who served combat stints in Korea and Vietnam as an African-American over a period of tremendous social change. In 1971, he and 31 other members of the 326th Medical Battalion of the 101st Airborne received bronze stars, likely for operations undertaken in support of the South Vietnamese invasion of Laos known as Lam Son 719.
I know very little about my grandfather’s motivations for serving in the Army, but I still thought of him on election night, along with the Khans. It seems that even if the military has managed, imperfectly and intermittently, to accept the inclusion of a wider circle of Americans—my grandfather when he enlisted in the late 1940s, Humayan Khan in the early 21st century—American society at times struggles more profoundly to do so.
Donald Trump may represent an oddly pure expression of this American reality because of his outright disrespect for the military as an institution. Over the course of the campaign, he managed to insult prisoners of war and Purple Heart winners, as well as Humayan Khan’s family. Perhaps Trump, at some implicit level, knows that the military, at its best, has not stood for making America “great again,” but rather for taking America forward—past slavery, past segregation, past fascism, past a world that needs militaries at all. Certainly my grandfather and the other men and women of color that have served over the centuries had no mythic past to which they could hope to return, only a more just future to which they could look forward.
Many never saw that future, because our society tends to forget the hard-won lessons of war in the comfort of peace. And in forgetting, we have repeatedly insulted the sacrifice of those who were willing to die to consecrate an America they knew they would never enjoy. These patriots, like Captain Khan, are the truly “forgotten men and women” of Trump’s America.
Over the next four or eight years, it is our duty to ensure that they are remembered, and that their memory is not further insulted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a group, we represent 13 Harvard graduates from the classes of 2014, 2015 and 2016. We have different backgrounds—we are eight women and five men, six people of color, six first-generation citizens, and four LGBT students—and we spent our time on campus in different ways—we are four peer counselors, one varsity athlete, two PBHA volunteers, one HoCo chair, one UC representative, five Crimson editors, three members of the Advocate, three members of the Signet, and one member of a female final club.
Some of us see final clubs as toxic to the Harvard community. Some of us think the criticisms against them are exaggerated. For some of us, the biggest problem with final clubs isn’t gender discrimination—it’s racism, or classism, or elitism, or sexual assault. And some of us feel that, as alumni, we are too removed to weigh in at all.
But we’re writing together from across the pond because, as Marshall and Rhodes Scholars, we are currently enjoying a privilege Harvard has threatened to withhold from future members of clubs that refuse to go co-ed. And while we don’t agree on everything, we do agree on this: the faculty and administration should do everything in their power to combat the discriminatory practices of final clubs.
Last spring, Harvard’s administration ignited campus-wide debate by announcing a policy that would bar future members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding campus leadership positions and receiving College endorsement for fellowships. Members of sororities and female final clubs protested, male final club graduate boards promised lawsuits, and some faculty members—led by former Dean of the College Harry Lewis—introduced a motion to prevent the policy from being implemented.
That motion was scheduled for a faculty vote tomorrow, and a form of this letter was set to run today, urging faculty to vote it down. But then Dean Khurana preempted the vote by announcing a new faculty committee to review the policy. In response, Dean Lewis withdrew the motion with the threat that, unless the policy is rewritten to his satisfaction, the motion will be reintroduced.
We strongly believe that the administration should not capitulate: while the policy may not have been perfect, it would have begun to upend the discriminatory system by which final clubs operate.
Whether you try to join them (as some of us did) or refuse to enter them (as others of us did), final clubs are unavoidable. Sitting in Lowell House on a Saturday night or walking down Mount Auburn on a Sunday morning, you know they're there and, likelier than not, you know you're not welcome.
Access to these spaces is, necessarily, exclusionary—the clubs have finite resources. In deciding who can participate, however, the clubs do not merely exclude: they discriminate on the basis of a number of factors—including, debatably, race, class, social status, and sexual orientation. But one factor is not open to debate: gender.
Harvard’s campus is dominated by multi-million-dollar, male-controlled mansions that women can enter only by invitation. Men decide party themes, send out invitations, and open the door. Harvard women can choose whether to accede to the rules men write, but they cannot write any of their own. While women’s groups have tried to compete, they simply lack the resources. The oldest was founded in 1991. Relative to the male final clubs, the female clubs are new, poor, and unconnected in the professional world.
Harvard began to admit women only in the 1970s—a decade after Princeton and Yale. In 2017, women remain second-class citizens of the Harvard community because they lack equal access to, and power over, its campus. And that means as long as the final clubs remain single-gender, women will never be equal to their male peers at Harvard.
When we hear about faculty opposition to the administration’s efforts to combat discrimination, we are mystified—and we are stunned that Professor Lewis has likened these efforts to President Trump's immigrant and refugee bans. We are concerned that the faculty committee, working under Dean Lewis’s threat of a new faculty motion, will undermine the administration’s crucial first steps toward equality on campus. We do not all agree on the policy’s details, like whether women’s groups should be included, or if leadership positions and fellowships should be used as penalties. But if, in a year, the policy has become unobtrusive enough to meet Dean Lewis’s standards, the faculty will have done a disservice to the university.
Rather than stall Harvard’s progress, the committee can be an opportunity to shore up and expand efforts to combat discrimination on Harvard’s campus. There is broad consensus that Harvard, as a private organization, is legally empowered to uphold non-discrimination. After all, Harvard is merely following the precedent set decades ago by even stricter policies at Princeton, Middlebury and Williams. As the motion’s own proponents have acknowledged, no rights—including the right to freedom of association—are unlimited.
And while the original co-ed policy was intended to promote gender equality, it is crucial to note that neither male nor female final clubs will necessarily become open, accessible spaces simply by going co-ed. Some clubs more readily admit low-income, minority, or LGBT students, but, on the whole, final clubs comprise some of the most privileged contingents of Harvard’s population. 20 percent of Harvard students come from families whose combined income totals below $65,000, yet that fraction, according to widespread perception on campus, is scarcely represented in these powerful organizations.
We challenge our peers to implement institutional changes like open punch, and we encourage the faculty to consider policies to address a wide range of problems, like racism and sexual assault, more directly. We ask Harvard’s administration not to cave in to pressure from faculty and alumni, and we ask our professors to support the administration’s efforts. Harvard must make good on its promise of “freedom from discrimination” and a “home in Harvard’s diverse community.” At a time when women’s rights and dignity are under attack, Harvard should not place its stamp of approval on gender-based discrimination.

Between parodies and a Pudding Pot, actor Ryan Reynolds accepted the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Man of the Year Award Friday evening to laughter and fanfare.
Reynolds, known for his roles in “The Proposal,” “Green Lantern,” and last year’s critical and box office success “Deadpool,” joked about his previous acting roles and wife Blake Lively as Hasty Pudding cast members roasted the actor.
“Where would society be today without cinematic masterpieces like 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle?'” Adam L. Chiavacci ’18 said, poking fun at one of Reynolds’s more lighthearted film appearances.
Chiavacci, a Hasty Pudding producer, led the jokes along with co-producer Natalie Y.C. Kim ’18.
The comedy roast was followed by a press conference, during which Reynolds said he didn’t know what to expect from the Hasty Pudding event. He said he enjoyed that he was uninformed.
“I didn’t know that much, so it was just sort of fun. I like going to something not really knowing what I’m doing, which you can tell by my resume sometimes,” he said.
Reynolds also said that although he never expected he would visit Harvard, he enjoyed his stay. Before the award ceremony, Pudding cast members and members of the female acapella group the Radcliffe Pitches gave Reynolds a campus tour.
“I’ve spent the day largely with students at Harvard, and there’s something pretty exceptional about all of these young men and women because it’s like hanging out with a bunch of people with the acumen of a worldly forty year old,” Reynolds joked.
During the press conference, Reynolds also said he preferred kissing his wife over actor Andrew Garfield—at the Golden Globe Awards in January, a kiss between Reynolds and Garfield stole tabloid headlines.
“I’m going to go with my wife, on that one, for a number of reasons,” he said. “But make no mistake, Andrew Garfield is a wonderful kisser. Very generous. A real darting tongue.”
The Man of the Year award, established in 1963, is presented by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals annually to “performers who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment,” according to the Pudding website. Past recipients have included Robert De Niro, Justin Timberlake, and most recently, actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 2016.
Reynolds’ visit follows that of actress Octavia Spencer, who the Hasty Pudding celebrated as their Woman of the Year on Jan. 26. After Friday’s Man of the Year festivities, Reynolds attended the Pudding’s opening night performance of “Casino Evil.”

Encouraging student groups at Harvard to resist President Donald Trump through forming coalitions and organizing protests, Harvard University Dining Services workers and union organizers shared lessons they learned from their 22-day strike this past fall.
The event, entitled “Resisting Trump: Lessons from the HUDS Strike,” was held Saturday at Phillips Brooks House and organized by the Student Labor Action Movement and UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents HUDS workers. Harvard's dining workers staged a three week strike last semester amid tense contract negotiations with the University.
 The goal of the event was to “think about how we can collaborate and build the coalition that was able to win the strike and to bring those lessons into fights that we’re engaging in today,” said Anwar E. Omeish ’19, a member of SLAM. “We’re coming together with the idea that issues that affect students are also affect workers [and] are also issues that affect people across the country.”
According to Edward B. Childs, a dining services worker in Adams House, anti-Trump protesters and organizers need to use the same organizing tactics that Local 26 did during its strike.
“We thought the strike was over, but it’s back on,” he said. “Our members know that they can win, but you also have to be organized, be together, and form a coalition.”
Childs added that many Local 26 members oppose the Trump administration, especially because of Vice President Michael Pence’s support of “Right to Work” legislation, which hold that employees do not need to join or pay dues to unions in their workplaces.
As an example of Local 26’s efforts to protest against Trump, Childs pointed to a protest that dining hall workers at Northeastern in the union held on Inauguration Day. At noon, when the inauguration started, they walked out of the Northeastern dining halls and spent the rest of the day protesting.
Rosa I. Rivera, another HUDS worker, urged the audience to join protests against Trump even if students are not directly affected by the president’s initiatives.
“If we all hold that attitude—I’m not an immigrant, I’m not a Muslim—we’ll never get anywhere,” she said. “If the 750 workers who work for Harvard dining services had that attitude, we never would have won that strike.”
Rivera said the Local 26 strike was an example of effective organizing.
“Regardless of whether some of us were there for healthcare, regardless of whether some of us were there for our wages, we all came out together for one goal, to take down Harvard, the richest university in the world,” she said.
Rivera also urged students to resist Trump’s plans to restrict immigration to the United States, including a recent executive order that halted immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
“I don’t have a problem with Democrats. I don’t have a problem with Republicans. I don’t have a problem with the government. I have a problem with Donald Trump,” she said. “And if we don’t do something about it, he’s going to be a problem for us.”

Two upperclassmen residential Houses—Dunster and Winthrop—as well as the non-residential Dudley House are searching for new resident deans this spring, launching a process that will replace the principal link between undergraduates in the Houses and College administrators.
Resident Deans fulfill a number of roles in the undergraduate houses, including representing students before the College’s Administrative Board, and the searches begin as the deans in each of the three Houses step down.
According to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, a committee of House residents, tutors, and staff will interview candidates after a centralized screening process. O’Dair said she hopes the search will generate “national interest.”
“We want to get the best possible candidate pool,” O’Dair said. “I help lead the search process and work very closely with the teams in the Houses.”
Finalists will also be invited to tour the Houses with students, faculty deans, and administrators, including staff from the Office of Student Life and the University’s Campus Services department, before the College extends offers for the positions. Pending their successful academic appointment to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, resident deans serve renewable five-year terms, according to O’Dair.
Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, a former Government lecturer and Dunster House resident dean, left Harvard in early January to take a position in President Donald Trump’s administration. Diaz Rosillo had served as a member of the 45th president’s transition team since November. His course, Government 1359: “The Road to the White House,” had the second largest course enrollment at the College when it was offered in spring 2016.
In a weekly message to Dunster residents on Jan. 23, Dunster Faculty Deans Roger B. Porter and Ann R. Porter, wrote: “An engaging and gifted teacher, Carlos taught many of you in his popular course on ‘The Road to the White House.’ Now he is taking that road himself and we wish him well.”
Jennifer J. Hsiao, a resident tutor in the House, has served as Dunster’s acting resident dean since Diaz Rosillo’s sabbatical leave in fall 2016.
Winthrop House will welcome a new resident dean when  in August after construction is completed on a year-long renovation of House.
Resident Dean Gregg A. Peeples will leave Winthrop, where he has served as the House’s live-in administrator since 2006. He is a lecturer on Government and teaches freshman and House seminars on “The Laws of War.” Peeples did not respond to requests for comment.
Winthrop Faculty Deans Stephanie R. Robinson and Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr., declined to comment for this story.
Dudley House Resident Dean Christopher M. Gilbert, a History Ph.D. student, will be leaving at the end of the spring semester, according to O’Dair. Gilbert did not respond to requests for comment.
Dudley is Harvard’s “13th House” for undergraduates who live off-campus or in cooperative style housing at the Dudley Co-op. Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students are affiliated with Dudley as well.
Although resident deans hold half-time faculty appointment in FAS, their role has become increasingly administrative over the past few decades. The position was the subject of controversy in 2013 when then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds conducted secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts.
Subsequent revisions to the position included changing the deans’ title, stipulating that holders possess a Ph.D., and restructuring the reporting line back to the Dean of the College or their designee.
The College will begin reviewing applications in March, according to job postings for the position, and their appointments will be effective July 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of attendees from across the United States gathered in Paine Concert Hall Friday and Saturday for “Black Lives Matter: Music, Race, and Justice,” a conference examining the intersection between black culture and race relations.
The conference, hosted by the Harvard Graduate Music Forum, featured a faculty panel, discussions of academic papers, and a musical performance. Ian R. Copeland and Laurie Lee, two Harvard graduate students who study music, said they organized the conference to highlight a lack of academic attention paid to black music. Copeland added that music often plays a large role in American race relations and discrimination against black people.
“We were inspired by and also troubled by... police shootings throughout the United States, but also what seemed to be increasing hostility to the Black Lives Matter movement in the political sphere,” Copeland said.
Copeland added that music is often a powerful tool in dealing with painful events.
“Music is a big resource for people dealing with trauma and finding expression,” he said. “Popular music in particular can be a way to bring people together and to call people to action.”
On Friday, the conference’s first “paper session” examined three academic papers which centered on inclusion of black people in music, academia, and music education.
The next event discussed the role academics can play in political activism around race. The panel featured four speakers from New York University, Dartmouth College, the Ohio State University, and a local Black Lives Matter chapter in Cambridge, Mass.
Treva Lindsey, a professor of women’s, gender, and sexuality studies at Ohio State University and a current Harvard W.E.B. DuBois fellow, described her response as a professor to Michael Brown’s shooting on Aug. 9, 2014. Lindsey said many black people reacted to Brown's death at the hands of a police officer with an “exasperation that was built for hundreds of years." She said she saw her role after the shooting as a caregiver to students in distress.
“What is my responsibility in this moment? To speak to my students in this moment, to care for my students in this moment, to show up for my students in this moment, to speak directly to my students on campus in this moment,” Lindsey said.
Regarding the current role of music studies in race relations, NYU professor Matthew D. Morrison said he believes that music studies needed to “benefit from” the activism and passion of Black Lives Matter.
Morrison stated that academics have the responsibility “to realize that because we have a position as writers, as cultural thinkers, as all of these things, to be active in making sure that things that we feel like are important to the larger community and society” are reflected in music studies. If they are not, Morrison said, organizing outside of academic institutions is necessary.
“There are various ways of organizing, various ways of dealing with history, various ways of finding ways to deconstruct the institution in the cause that you can learn from,” Morrison said.
Saturday’s events featured three paper sessions: “Black Religion, Black Space, and Black Speech,” “Improvisation, Struggle, and Liberation,” and “Vernacular Culture and the Power of Celebrity.” The conference concluded with a piano performance from Karen Walwyn, an Associate Professor of Music at Howard University, and a keynote lecture from Morrison.
In the weekend’s last paper session, Kimberlee D. Sanders, a Harvard graduate student in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilization, presented her paper: “Sorry/I Ain’t Sorry: Beyoncé’s 'Lemonade,' Southern Gothic Temporality, and Reclaiming the Angry Black Woman.” Sanders proposed that the role of anger in "Lemonade" fostered a sense of community and empowered women of color, asserting that it “reclaims a space for black female anger.”
Sanders discussed the underrepresentation of black female contributions in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.
“Their marginalization becomes this vortex that generates a righteous anger of saying ‘look at the trauma that I’ve endured. Look at the things I have done. Look at me. Let me occupy space,’” Sanders said in an interview.

Iranian scientist Samira Asgari stood in front of the security agent at Boston Logan Airport Friday afternoon, unable to believe what she had just heard.
“I asked him, ‘So I can really go?’ And he smiled and said, ‘Yes, yes you can go. Welcome to the United States,’” Samira said.
Gripping her luggage, Samira walked through the international arrivals gate and into the embrace of her friends, lawyers, and labmates from Harvard Medical School, all of them screaming her name. After two failed attempts and a week of sleepless nights, Samira had finally reached the United States to pursue her dream: researching tuberculosis at Harvard.
Samira, along with at least three other Harvard affiliates, was barred from flying to the country a week ago after President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. After a Mass. federal judge granted a temporary stay of Trump’s order Jan. 28, three of the four—Samira and Iranian sisters Marzieh and Amene Asgari, who are not related to Samira—flew into Logan Airport over the weekend.
Seyed S. S. Saravi, the fourth Harvard affiliate barred from the United States who had planned to study cardiovascular medicine at the Medical School, wrote in an email Sunday that he was still stuck in Iran, unable to leave due to visa complications.
“I am so happy for the visa holders and hope the best wishes for them,” Saravi wrote. “But, unfortunately, my visa is in hands of US Consular in Dubai [and] my wife’s visa is under processing.”
Samira, Marzieh, and Amene all have valid travel visas and had been planning to come to the United States for months. Samira will join Medical School professor Soumya Raychaudhuri’s laboratory, Amene will perform mathematical modelling for another Medical School laboratory, and Marzieh will conduct research in the Philosophy Department.
On Wednesday, Samira sued Trump and officials from the Department of Homeland Security, arguing she should be allowed in the country. Her lawsuit is ongoing.
Minutes after arriving in the airport, Samira found herself thronged by reporters, cameramen, and wellwishers. Someone handed her a rose, and Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy III—who had traveled specially to the airport for the occasion—leaned in to shake her hand and whisper in her ear.
In a quieter moment, Raychaudhuri told her he “couldn’t believe” she was here. Samira nodded.
“I’m still shaking,” she said.
Marzieh and Amene said they had a similarly warm welcome when they arrived at Logan Airport with Marzieh’s two-year-old daughter Sophie Saturday evening. Marzieh said she and her sister were mobbed by supporters and lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, one of whom “even brought a carseat for my little girl.”
But the warmest welcome came from Mahboubeh Asgari-Targhi, Amene and Marzieh’s sister who works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Marzieh said Sophie made a beeline into her aunt’s arms.
“Sophie, she was very excited when she saw my sister, they are very, very close,” Marzieh said.
Samira, Marzieh, and Amene all said the past week had been difficult and that they were relieved to reach the United States. The trio emphasized they were grateful for the support they received from friends and strangers alike over the last few days.
“If I wanted to write the story of my life, I think I would definitely mention this in my book,” Amene said.
Though both said they were “incredibly excited” to be at Harvard, Amene and Marzieh said they were sad to leave their mother behind. Marzieh said she had planned to invite her mother to Cambridge sometime in the next few months.
But Marzieh said she no longer thinks her mother will be able to travel, given the current political climate in the United States. Amene added she hopes Harvard students will take inspiration from her and her sister’s situation.
“There are things when you are very young, in your early twenties, you take for granted: traveling somewhere, seeing your family,” she said. “Those who are students now, they will be politicians and leaders in the future. I think they should change these things so it is easy for everyone.”
“Imagine, if this ban wasn’t in place, I could see my mother,” Amene added.
Reflecting on the last few days, Samira said she navigated what she called a “nightmarish week” by drawing on her training as a scientist. She said research can often be frustrating, and demands persistence.
“You need persistence to get not only the result that you wish but the result that convinces you it’s correct, and this doesn’t happen for a day or week or month, usually it takes years,” she said. “I think that persistence that I have innately but also that has been trained through my career as a scientist helped me to go through this.”
Samira, Amene, and Marzieh start work Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a meeting with Undergraduate Council leaders Friday, University President Drew G. Faust said she will ask Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith to address the rising costs of textbooks at the March Faculty meeting.
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 discussed her meeting with Faust in a short Council general meeting Sunday afternoon. Sachee and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 attended the meeting with Faust.
Sachee said she was pleased that Faust said she would ask Smith to address high textbook prices. During Sachee and Khansarinia’s November campaign for the Council’s highest posts, the two ran on a platform that sought to address textbook affordability.
According to Sachee, Smith will discuss textbook prices at a Faculty meeting in March.
“We believe this is really, really cool because a lot of University professors from all different departments come to this meeting,” she said. “If it’s coming from a rather high place, it’ll have some meaning there.”
Sachee noted that the Education Committee will continue to work on ways to lower textbook costs in the meantime.
The pair also talked to Faust about President Donald Trump’s recent executive order, which placed a temporary ban on immigration from seven majority Muslim countries, Sachee said. Harvard, along with other Massachusetts universities, signed an amicus brief challenging the order, and Faust criticized Trump’s actions in an email to affiliates Jan. 29.
“She’s thinking long term about the future, about what this means for students are impacted,” Sachee said. “We did bring up with her what will happen for students who perhaps might not be able to go home over the summer and brought up funding and things like that.”
Sachee and Khansarinia also talked to Faust about single-gender organizations and the new committee tasked with revisiting the sanctions. The committee—which will be comprised of students, faculty, and staff—has yet to determine its members.
“It was a really, really productive meeting. We met with her for 45 minutes. We’re hoping to also see her again at the end of the semester,” Sachee said.
Eight newly-elected Undergraduate Council members were also introduced on Sunday after the Council’s midterm elections concluded on Friday. The election saw low turnout throughout the Houses, and Sachee previously said she hopes to increase student participation in elections.
“I just want to sort of thank you guys very, very much for running in these elections,” Sachee told them. “Normally midterm elections are not as publicized and so we often don't fill all of our seats. I really, really just want to thank you guys for running.”
Later in the meeting, Sachee announced plans for a Council-wide effort to spread awareness about the ‘Grant for an Open Harvard College,' a grant that still has approximately twenty thousand dollars left in the budget. At the meeting, Sachee outlined a plan for dining hall outreach to publicize the grant.
“Students just don't know about it and it's money that is for them to throw events, to do projects, to make initiatives. So we need to tell them that we have this money,” Sachee said.
The grant was introduced under former UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, and funds College initiatives under five compelling interests: financial accessibility, “race, culture, and faith relations,” social spaces, sexual assault and harassment prevention, and mental health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, Tuesday's Faculty meeting will be business as usual for members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. They will hear a presentation on Faculty trends, discuss the Biomedical Engineering concentration, and consider creating a new degree.
But the agenda for the meeting, released Friday, includes a notable absence: a motion proposed by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 opposing the unrecognized single-gender social organization sanctions.
Lewis’s decision to forego his motion came a few days after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the creation of a faculty committee to examine the current policy, which, starting with the class of 2021, prohibits members of the organizations from holding club and sports team leadership positions and being nominated for certain selective scholarships.
The motion, introduced in May 2016, resolved that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.” University President Drew G. Faust tabled the motion until 2017 at the full Faculty meeting in December, and further discussion on the motion was expected to continue at the upcoming Feb. meeting.
Despite the change in plans, the meeting will carry on with three scheduled docket items, according to the agenda, which was obtained by The Crimson.
Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser will present a long-delayed presentation on Faculty trends. In an interview last month, Faust said discussion of the sanctions had taken a long time and pushed Zipser’s presentation back.
“...I can’t remember how many Faculty meetings now this has taken and Nina Zipser still is waiting to give her report on faculty hiring and there’s a lot of faculty business that needs to get done,” Faust said in an interview last month about the sanctions on single-gender social organizations.
Also on Tuesday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris will present a review of the six-year-old Biomedical Engineering concentration, which was established by Faculty vote in 2010.
Finally, Professor of Economics and Statistics Department Chair Neil Shephard will request that the Faculty create a Master’s degree program for Data Science, under the purview of a standing committee appointed by Faust. This item is up for discussion only.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late January, Harvard Management Company announced it was changing course: it will largely cut its internal management teams and retain external managers to handle almost all of the University’s $35.7 billion endowment, laying off approximately half of its staff.
Only two internal teams of managers will walk away from the changes intact: the firm’s natural resources team, which HMC will continue to manage in-house, and its highly-successful real estate branch, which is expected to strike off on its own to form a hedge fund.
But experts say that if the real estate team—which earned a 20.2 percent return on its investments in fiscal year 2016—continues to do business with HMC as an external management unit, it could earn salaries well above what members of the team drew in at HMC for doing mostly the same job.
For Charles A. Skorina, the head of a firm that conducts searches for financial executives across the country, this is not necessarily uncommon for the investment industry.
“It’s fairly common to see an internal group at an endowment that’s done well spin off and retain an investment from the endowment,” Skorina said. “Now they’re an outside firm and one of their key investors is the endowment they came from. That’s normal. That’s not shocking.”
Harvard Business School lecturer Randolph “Randy” B. Cohen said the relationship between HMC and the newly-formed real estate hedge fund could take a number of forms. Harvard’s investment arm could request “preferential terms of some sort” from the hedge fund, like superior access to the fund’s talent and increased liquidity in its assets, among other things.
As external managers, the members of the real estate team stand to make even more money for providing the same services to Harvard’s investment arm. But Cohen said the newly-formed hedge fund might not hike up its asking price in return for business from HMC, one of the most prestigious investors in higher education.
“We might expect HMC will pay them more to be on their own than they paid them to be employees, but we don’t know for sure, " Cohen wrote in an email. "Maybe the opportunity to build a business, with the prestige of HMC as their first investor, is sufficiently attractive that they’re willing to do the work for HMC for no more than they received when on staff, or conceivably for even less.”
Skorina agreed that though the newly-formed hedge fund will have the opportunity to set the price of its services at market value—significantly higher than what it is paid internally by HMC—it will likely grant its former employer a discount.
As of right now, HMC’s real estate team is the only investment cohort that is expected to continue to do business with Harvard. But the firm’s natural resource assets will continue to be invested internally, even as HMC cuts its 230-person staff roughly in half.
Roger G. Ibbotson, a professor at Yale, said shortly after the announcement of the changes that large endowments shifting to external management would keep a specific asset class managed in-house for one of two reasons. It might happen if the asset class performed extremely well—an unlikely case for Harvard’s natural resources investments, which returned negative 10.2 percent on its investments in fiscal year 2016—or was too difficult to sell off in the current market.
Skorina said the real estate group is the “only team they [HMC] cited as winners,” and that it was unlikely HMC would seek business with its other investment teams if they decided to spin off.
“I think [HMC chief executive officer N.P Narvekar] was pretty clear that performance wasn’t up to snuff,” Skorina said of HMC’s other teams. “Why would Harvard give people who perform poorly inside money? Why would Harvard then invest with them when they’re outside?”
The sweeping changes in investment strategy—which some experts say indicate an attempt by Narvekar to recreate the investment strategies of peer institutions like Columbia and Yale—mark the investment chief’s first public moves as he sets off on the task of improving Harvard’s struggling endowment.
In fiscal year 2016, Harvard posted the lowest returns on its investments since the height of the financial crisis, returning negative 2 percent on its investments. Combined with other expenses, including the $1.7 billion Harvard allocates to its annual budget from the endowment, the endowment’s value fell nearly $2 billion in fiscal year 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Massachusetts federal judge ruled Friday against plaintiffs supported by Harvard and other Boston-area universities, declining to extend a temporary stay on President Donald Trump’s immigration order.
The suit—filed by five individuals from countries listed in Trump’s order and international non-profit organization Oxfam—called for an extension of a ruling that temporarily opened Massachusetts to travellers from the listed countries. The initial stay, which enabled people like Harvard researcher and Iranian scientist Samira Asgari to land in Boston last week, expired early Sunday.
Harvard and seven other universities in the area—Boston College, Boston University, Brandeis, MIT, Northeastern, Tufts, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute—filed an amicus brief Friday morning requesting that the judge grant “declaratory and injunctive relief” to the plaintiffs.
But Harvard’s and the other universities’ argument did not convince the judge to rule in the plaintiffs’ favor.
“The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims,” Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton wrote in his 21-page decision.
Hours after Gorton issued his decision, a federal judge in Seattle granted a nationwide injunction temporarily blocking the executive order, which bars immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. While the ruling from the judge in Seattle renders the Mass. ruling obsolete, the Mass. case featured the University’s first legal challenge to the executive order.
Harvard and the other universities outlined an argument similar to Oxfam’s in their 40-page amicus brief, according to Law School professor Gerald L. Neuman, who specializes in immigration law. Oxfam argued that the executive order “violated its First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, association and petition by barring entry of aliens, including visa holders, into the United States,” according to the ruling.
“The universities were not themselves also plaintiffs in the case, but they filed a brief explaining how their situation is similar in terms of the effect on their First Amendment rights,” Neuman said.
In their brief, the universities charge that Trump’s executive order “undermines the values and contributions of open academic exchange and collaboration” essential to their success.

“Amici’s ability to succeed as institutions of higher education depends, in large part, on the ability of students and scholars to collaborate across borders,” the brief reads. “It is essential that our commitments to national security not unduly stifle the free flow of ideas and people that are critical to progress in a democratic society.”
In his ruling, Groton rejected Oxfam’s first amendment argument, writing that Trump had lawfully blocked the entry of specific groups of foreign nationals and upholding Trump’s justification for doing so.
The University decided to sign onto the amicus brief because it is “important to have our voice heard” on the negative effects of Trump’s executive order, Harvard General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 wrote in a statement. Forty-nine students and 62 scholars holding visas from the targeted countries are affiliated with Harvard, according to the brief. The visa applications of 21 scholars from the impacted countries are currently pending.
According to the brief, the executive order barred scholars from entering the country, jeopardized the visas of students from the seven countries, and prompted foreign academics to boycott conferences.
“Harvard’s academic interests are global and we are at our best when the best students and faculty from across the world join together to solve problems for the benefit of society,” Iuliano wrote.
The legal status of Trump’s executive order has continued to evolve since Gorton’s ruling. The Justice Department unsuccessfully appealed for the order to immediately be put back into place after the Washington ruling, but the appeals process remains ongoing and will likely reach the Supreme Court.
“The thing that’s so unusual about this is it’s a high-profile event that affects a lot of people in so many different cases, and they’ve been able to mobilize legal representation, and all of a sudden there’s all this parallel litigation moving forward,” Neuman said.
With simultaneous litigation producing sometimes contradictory rulings—as in the Massachusetts and Washington cases—the status of the executive order even in the very near future is “really impossible to predict,” Neuman said.
“The news one day may be different than the news the next day, because everything is so recent and is moving so rapidly,” he said. “And it’s not all moving in the same direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Snacking on buffalo wings and sipping beers, football fans across campus crowded around common room TVs to watch the New England Patriots defeat the Atlanta Falcons in an unprecedented 34-28 overtime upset in the fifty-first Super Bowl Sunday night.
After an annual Super Bowl-themed dinner of wings and quesadillas in the dining halls, some students put problem sets and readings aside for the evening and gathered at House Committee parties to watch the game. For the roughly 30 students streaming the game in the Quincy Junior Common Room, the Patriots’ game-winning touchdown drive sparked an outpouring of cheers and hugs.
“We’re the legend, man,” said Mike A. Skerrett ’18, a Boston native. “I never counted them out.”
For a majority of the game, though, things were not looking good for the Patriots. Early in the game, the Falcons took a commanding 28-3 lead, leaving Patriots fans across campus dispirited.
“We were pretty worried that there was going to be a blowout by the Falcons,” said Danny L. Rodriguez ‘18. “We watched the first three minutes, went upstairs to do some homework, and then the game ended up turning around.”
Led by quarterback Tom Brady, the Patriots stormed back and put up 25 consecutive points, forcing the game into overtime with 57 seconds left on the clock. A coin flip in New England's favor to begin overtime all but sealed the team’s fifth Super Bowl victory.
At House Committee parties in most of the upperclassman Houses, the mood was celebratory—for some more than others.
“It’s super cool to see such a good turnout and everyone here just being together to watch the game,” said Allison D. Oliva ’18, a Quincy House Committee co-chair and Falcons fan.
Steven S.K. Hao ’18, a former Crimson Arts editor, said that the Super Bowl is “the only football game” he watches.
“I don’t have an allegiance to either team,” Hao said at the beginning of the fourth quarter. “Since I’m here in Boston, I would be slightly more happy with a win from the Patriots, but I wouldn’t be crushed or elated either way.”
Students at the Quincy viewing party ended the night with an impromptu champagne shower with the Quincy Faculty Dean Deborah J. Gehrke in the courtyard.
“I feel so vindicated considering our blockmate decided to spend the entire game trash talking the Patriots,” said Hansy D. Piou ’18 in the midst of the post-game celebration. “It’s a good night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming off of a 4-1 loss to Northeastern in the first round of the Women’s Beanpot, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (3-17-4, 3-11-4 ECAC) returned to the Bright Landry Hockey Center to face off against a pair of ranked opponents in No. 5/5 St. Lawrence and No. 3/3 Clarkson.
“We weren’t ready to play on Tuesday night and right from the beginning of the game, our focus and intensity weren’t where they should be,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I think we recognized that we have seven more games [coming into Friday]. If we keep working, we can try to get ourselves into the playoffs”.
Coming into the weekend slate, the Crimson had already faced 10 ranked opponents this season. The team went 0-7-3 in such games, with five of those contests going into overtime. In its matchups against the Golden Knights (21-4-5, 15-1-2) and Saints (23-3-2, 15-2-1) earlier this season, Harvard fell to both teams by scores of 4-0.  The Crimson was much closer in both contests the second time a row and was able to secure a point against Clarkson on Saturday.
HARVARD 2, No. 3/3 CLARKSON 2
The Crimson’s second game in as many days came against the nation’s third-ranked team. After a scoreless first period, the Golden Knights opened the scoring in the second, as senior forward Cayley Mercer scored at 5:29 off of the power play.
“Our kids are really resilient, and it doesn’t always show in the box score, but we’ve been in that situation a lot where we’ve been down one, down two, and we keep fighting,” said Stone. “And it’s more about us than it is about anyone else. It’s hard to spot someone multiple goals and keep scratching and trying to win. But that’s a testament to them”.
Following its coach’s words, the team quickly responded to Clarkson’s goal. Less than three minutes later, junior forward Lexie Laing’s shot from the right wing was stopped but junior forward Haley Mullins was able to collect the puck and score. The Crimson took the lead with 19:01 remaining in the second, as Laing won a faceoff and fed junior defender Chelsea Ziadie for the one-timer.
Harvard’s defense held firm throughout the third period until a late penalty with 1:47 to play. On the power play, the Golden Knights pulled their goalie and elected to have six skaters on the ice. The gamble pulled off as sophomore forward Rhyen McGill netted the equalizer with 48 seconds to play. With neither team able to score in the closing seconds, the Crimson broke a school record by playing an extra session for the ninth time this season.
In overtime, the teams both had four shots, but neither was able to score the decisive goal.
No. 5/5 ST. LAWRENCE 2, HARVARD, 1
The action started early in the Crimson’s game against St. Lawrence, as Saints freshman forward Kalie Grant scored the game’s opening goal just 1:43 into the opening period. Despite the early goal, Harvard controlled the puck for much of the first period, outshooting St. Lawrence, 13-11.
Just over three minutes into the second frame, the Saints took advantage of a power play to push their lead to 2-0 with a goal from junior forward Kennedy Marchment. However, Harvard pulled to within a goal before the end of the period. Two minutes later, sophomore forward Kate Hallett and senior defender Briana Mastel freed the puck from behind the net. When the Saints tried to clear the puck, freshman defender Kyra Colbert deflected the puck past the goalie for the score, the first of her career. On the play, Hallet and Mastel picked up their first and ninth assists on the season, respectively.
In the third period, Harvard continued to dominate the action, outshooting St. Lawrence, 12-7. However, the Crimson was unable to net the equalizer, as Saints sophomore goalie Grace Harrison made 12 of her 32 saves in the period.
“It was a good game,” co-captain Sydney Daniels said. “We controlled momentum for a lot of the game. I think that’s going give us more momentum going into our game against Clarkson. I think if we keep playing relentlessly and pressure all over the ice like we did, more pucks will bounce our way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 18 Harvard women’s water polo team split its first two matches Saturday to open the 2017 season. Competing in the Coleman Aquatics Center at Brown, the Crimson dropped the first match of the Bruno Classic to No. 21 Wagner but rebounded with a decisive 13-6 win against Iona.
“Overall I think the weekend was a success,” sophomore Kristen Hong said. “Although we did suffer a tough loss to Wagner, I think the game showed us what we need to work on in order to succeed as a program. I’m really excited for this season because I think we have so much more room to grow in terms of executing our goals.”
HARVARD 13, IONA 6
Entering the second game of the Bruno Classic, Harvard found itself finishing the first quarter with a tied score for the second contest in a row. This time, however, it was the Crimson who quickly built ar lead in the second period.
The numbers alone proved astounding. In that second period, nine different players scored 10 goals for Harvard.
“We had a really good stretch in the Iona game where we went 10-0 on them,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I saw flashes of what this team is capable of doing.”
Despite Iona outscoring the Crimson 4-1 in the third quarter, Hong’s final-period hat trick and a strong showing by freshmen Julie Harrison, Angie Varona and Lana Gorlinski helped guarantee the victory for Harvard.
“I think what we lacked in the Wagner game was our normal energy level and enthusiasm for the game, which we brought to the Iona game,” said Hong. “In the end that made all the difference.”
WAGNER 10, HARVARD 5
Having already played several games this season, Wagner (1-3) came ready to fight hard. In the opening period, Harvard freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz found the net twice in her first collegiate game, but both her goals elicited immediate responses from the Seahawks.
In the second and third quarters, Wagner gained momentum and opened a 9-4 lead. Though the Crimson made a push in the final period, the Seahawks successfully contained the Harvard attack to leave the pool with a win
The Crimson women's water polo team now heads to Bucknell to compete in the Bison Invitational on February 11th and 12th.
“Its very early in the season, and we’re coming off of the toughest preseason we’ve had since I got here,” Minnis said. “We made some mistakes against a very good Wagner team, but they have played several games this season. It was our first.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For three months, the Harvard women’s basketball team (16-3, 4-2 Ivy) could do no wrong. With 16 wins in a row, the Crimson had tied a program record and bulldozed its way into the national conversation.
After 48 disappointing hours, not only is any hope of entry into the Top 25 gone, but also the team’s first Ivy League title since the 2007-2008 season may have slipped away as well.
Harvard fell in both contests this past weekend, losing in convincing fashion at Penn (12-6, 5-0), 63-43, before being upset by Princeton (9-9, 3-2) in overtime on Saturday.
“To be honest with you, whether we admit it or not, that winning streak was like a monkey on our back,” said coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We’ve been way below our potential consistently for most of the games.”
PRINCETON 63, HARVARD 58 (OT)
The Crimson traveled to Central New Jersey on Saturday night to face the Tigers, who had struggled after becoming the first team in Ancient Eight history to enter the tournament with an at-large bid last season. Harvard started well, jumping out to a seven-point lead after one quarter, but a 19-5 third quarter in Princeton’s favor erased the deficit and then some.
Freshman point guard Katie Benzan, arguably the team’s best performer to this point in the season, was scintillating in the first half with 14 points to lead all scorers. The Tigers made a tactical switch to focus on denying her scoring opportunities, a move that limited the rookie to just three points in the second half plus overtime while forcing her into four turnovers.
“[Katie] was in a tough position, to be honest,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s hard when she’s drawing that much attention…. What she needs is for her teammates to get to the slots, get to the release position, and set a screen and roll. But I don’t think we did a very good job of that.”
An inspiring fourth-quarter comeback was in the cards, fueled by three straight field goals to open the frame and cut the deficit to three. After a triple by Tigers guard Gabrielle Rush, the game’s leading scorer with 18, captain Destiny Nunley scored five straight to trim the gap to one with under seven minutes to play. The Crimson eventually tied things up before Rush missed a three with time expiring.
A string of turnovers combined with hot shooting by Princeton doomed Harvard in overtime, with Princeton jumping out to a big lead and never looking back.
“There was no rhythm, and since we haven’t had to overcome a loss, this was a big test to see if we could put it behind us,” Delaney-Smith said. “Unbelievable basketball [against Princeton] to get back into the game, but again, we didn’t control what could control like execution.”
PENN 63, HARVARD 43
In the weekend’s first game, a torrid offensive performance condemned the visitors to defeat in Philadelphia, with Benzan, Nunley, and freshman center Jeannie Boehm, three of the Crimson’s top scorers, combining to shoot 3-for-26 from the field. As a team, Harvard made just 26.3 percent of its shots for 43 points, the worst output of the season.
The Quakers, now favored to go on and win a second-straight conference title, boast the best defense statistically in the Ivy League, allowing just 51.5 points per game. Harvard seemed to shoot itself in the foot, however, with poor execution and mistakes that led to 20 points off 13 Crimson turnovers.
“Penn wasn’t stealing passes, picking them off and getting layups. They were dead balls, forwards traveling, and our forwards...turning the ball over,” Delaney-Smith said. “We could not put the ball in the ocean. We were incredibly tight, disconnected, and fractured on offense.”
Besides junior guard Anna Ross, who grabbed 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting, Penn was fairly quiet offensively. An excellent defensive performance from Boehm, junior forward Taylor Rooks, and others helped keep the Quakers’ “twin towers” of Sydney Stipanovich and Michelle Nwokedi under wraps. The two forwards combined to make just 9-of-24 field goals on the day.
It was the offense, however, that never kicked into gear. The Crimson was down by nine after just one quarter, a deficit it never overcame. Sophomore guards Nani Redford and Sydney Skinner provided some spark off of the bench, with three assists and 11 points respectively, but it was too little and far too late.
“I don’t think we’ve played well since the Ivy League started,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’ve had toughness and found a way to win. But Penn is a really good team and Princeton has a winning attitude.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off competing in the St. John's Invitational a few weeks prior, the Harvard men's and women's fencing squads squared up against regional foes on Saturday at the Malkin Athletic Center. Both groups walked away with victories, with the women sweeping NYU and Tufts, and the men handling the Bobcats as well.
The No. 7 Crimson men (6-5) avenged last December's 14-13 nail-biter of a loss to NYU by taking all three weapons. Led by sophomore epee fencer Albert Chien's 3-0 record—including a come-from-behind victory in the final epee bout of the day—the epee group went 5-4, while the foil and saber teams finished with 6-3 and 5-4 bout records, respectively, to tally the Crimson's 16-11 overall win.
Also coming into the weekend ranked seventh in the nation, the women's squad dominated both the Bobcats and the Jumbos, with team wins of 20-7 and 25-2, respectively. Captain and foil fencer Liana Yamin and freshman saber fencer Marta Lasota both finished with undefeated records for the day, with Yamin posting a plus-12 touch indicator en route to four bout wins and Lasota winning all six of her bouts to carry a saber squad that finished 14-4 cumulatively on the day.
On the women's epee side, junior Claire Dinhut finished 3-0 and had a plus-3 indicator to key the Crimson.

For many Harvard runners, Friday marked the last chance ever to don the crimson and white before a home crowd. The Ivy Heptagonal Championships looms just three weekends away, so the Crimson Elite stood as the final competition for seniors in Cambridge.
Several top finishers stayed home, others traveled to Boston University, and a few did both. For everyone, it was a home meet in reality, if not name.
“The only way I would describe how I felt is that I was grateful,” men’s captain Julian Nunally said. “I've been honored to have been given the chance to walk onto the track team and compete with all of my heart for four years. I love my teammates, and I am glad to have made friends for life.”
CRIMSON ELITE
Hosting the final indoor track meet of the season at the Gordon Indoor Track facility, the Crimson men’s team finished in second place overall, only two points behind first-place Connecticut. The women’s team placed sixth out of the nine competing programs.
In the sprints, sophomore Gabby Thomas placed in the 60-meter dash, as she has been doing all season, claiming third with a solid time of 7.44 seconds. Teammate Jade Miller, a senior, placed eighth in the 60-meter hurdles with a season-best time of 8.55 seconds.
The men’s sprinters also maintained positions near the front of the pack. With a time of 8.07, junior Jay Hebert claimed bronze in the 60-meter hurdles. In the 400-meter dash, freshman Jacob McLennan posted a career-best time of 49.73 leading the team to its second bronze. He was followed closely by senior teammate James Heckendorn, who placed fourth in his season debut in the event.
The first gold medal of the weekend came as freshman Will Battershill fended off Wyatt Million, a junior runner from Connecticut, for a finishing time of 4:18.57. Million finished a mere 0.14 seconds later.
While only two of the women’s team placed in the running events, the field portion of the team excelled. Senior Nikki Owkelogu claimed gold in the shot put competition with a 16.08 meter throw. In weight throw, she placed seventh with a oss of 16.29 meters.
For the freshmen in long jump, it was a day to remember, as well. Both Simi Fajemisin and Zoe Hughes broke personal records this season, while Fajemisin performed the fourth best jump in school history to take fifth place with a leap of 5.90 meters. Hughes finished right behind her in sixth with a leap of 5.85 meters.
Women’s captain Raegan Nizdil led the team in high jump after a 1.65-meter spring to take seventh. With a personal best of 3.80 meters in pole vault, Nicole Renchard claimed the third-place position.
The men placed three members in jumping events along the team’s path to the second spot on the podium. Freshman Donagh Mahon led the group with a first-place jump of 1.94 meters in the high jump competition. Silver came with a 4.95 meter jump from sophomore Ian West in pole vault, while Nunally took third in shot put following a 16.43 meter throw.
“Importantly, the weight throw at this meet was one of my favorite memories,” Nunally said. “It was the last event of the meet, and a large portion of the team was watching and cheering me on. I thought their cheers were unwarranted, because I just started the weight this year and I am not very good. However, their energy really fueled my throws.”
SCARLET AND WHITE INVITATIONAL
Several student athletes traveled to the Scarlet and White Invitational hosted at Boston University on Saturday. Overall, the two teams racked up three gold medals.
“It's a good base to work off as we head towards the Ivy League Championships,” Mahon said. “We are excited and keen as ever to compete for ourselves and each other as we get closer to the big competitions. We're really just getting started.”
The lone man to ascend to the top spot on the podium was sophomore Myles Marshall. The runner clocked Harvard’s second-fastest time, only 0.05 seconds behind his own record, in the 800-meter dash.
The other two golds went to the women’s teams. In the 4x400-meter relay, a lineup consisting of Hughes, Thomas, Miller, and freshman Karina Joiner claimed the top spot in a time of 3:39.50. This result represents the fourth-fastest time in Crimson history. Senior Sarah Gillespie also took first place with a 2:56.37 1000-meter run.
In the sprints, Herbert posted a second-place finish in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.08 seconds. Joiner represented the women in the same event, pulling eighth place in just 8.81 seconds. Achieving his season best, freshman Micah Meekins took seventh in the 200-meter dash.
In the 400-meter dash, the runners from Harvard both achieved marks. For Heckendorn, his 13th-place, 49.33 finish represented a season best. Miller set a career best herself with 54.39 finish for fourth place. In the mile, freshman Brook Starn also claimed a season best with a time of 4:55.10, as she kicked her way to sixth place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amongst Bostonians, early February means one thing. It’s time for the city’s ritualistic college hockey tournament, the Beanpot.
Hosted at TD Garden, home of Beantown’s own Bruins and Celtics, the annual four-team tournament will kick off for the 65th time at 5 p.m. on Monday when the puck drops between the Crimson and Northeastern. After two semifinal matchups this week, a champion will be crowned the following Monday, and the winner will own the region’s hockey bragging rights until Boston University, Boston College, Harvard, and Northeastern lace them back up in 2018.
With four of the nation’s most storied hockey programs in action this week, including three top-10 powerhouses, there will be no shortage of elite talent on display. Between the four teams, 36 players have been drafted by NHL organizations. Here is a preview of each of the Crimson’s three Beanpot adversaries:
BOSTON COLLEGE
Defending tournament champions and winners of six of the last seven, the Eagles (18-9-2, 13-3-1 Hockey East) have truly dominated the hometown opposition in recent years. Since taking the reins of the program in the 1994-1995 season, coach Jerry York has propelled his squad to 15 finals appearances, of which nine have ended in celebration. BC’s 2008 overtime victory against Harvard marks the Crimson’s most recent appearance in the Beanpot final.
This season, BC enters Monday ranked eighth in the country—although new rankings will come out today—and the team sits atop Hockey East, boasting signature wins over No. 2 Denver and No. 15 Providence (twice) and splits with No. 17 Notre Dame and No. 18 Wisconsin. Also included in the Eagles’ schedule to date are losses to formidable foes No. 7 Minnesota and No. 13 North Dakota.
Against its fellow Beanpot competitors, BC is 2-3-0 on the year and was most recently swept in a Friday-Monday home-and-home with BU, its semifinal opponent.
The Chestnut Hill dwellers have been riding the solid play of their stars for much of the season. Senior forward Matthew Gaudreau, younger brother of ex-Eagle and Calgary Flames star Johnny, leads the club in points with 26, while five more skaters have notched at least 20 points. In net, freshman goaltender Joe Woll’s 14-8-1 record comes on the shoulders of a .921 save percentage.
A testament to its explosive youth, BC sent three players to represent the U.S. in this year’s IIHF World Junior Championships: Woll, sophomore blue-liner Casey Fitzgerald, and sophomore forward Colin White, who served as an alternate captain for the red, white, and blue and led Team USA in goals during the tournament with seven.
Games involving the Eagles tend to lack early scoring but then open up as they progress. Just 24 percent of goals—for and against—in BC’s games this season have occurred in the first frame, yet its +15 goal differential in the opening period is its highest in any frame.
When they square off with BU on Monday night at the Garden, the Eagles will be in search of their first victory of the season on neutral ice, as they have has posted an anomalous 0-3-1 record in unaffiliated rinks.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY

Arguably this year’s Beanpot favorites, the Terriers (18-7-2, 11-4-2) boast a roster overflowing with young talent and will arrive at the Garden on Monday night as the highest-ranked team—No. 3 in the country at the time of print—of the four competing.
BU is the only squad in the tournament to have already beaten its three Beanpot rivals this season. Wins against then-No. 4 Quinnipiac and current-No. 4 Union further decorate the Terriers’ impressive schedule to this point.
In its first contest of 2017, BU had plenty of space on its bench to fill while hosting Union. Seven of its 26 players were in Montreal vying for the WJC title, six of whom enjoyed an American victory alongside the three representatives from BC and Harvard freshman Adam Fox.
Among those who brought home the gold for the U.S. was freshman speedster Clayton Keller, whose 29 points on the season lead his team, despite the 5’10” center missing eight games with an injury. Amongst all active NCAA players, Keller is the highest-drafted NHL prospect. The Illinois native was selected seventh overall by the Arizona Coyotes in June’s draft.
Over the winter holiday, Keller also set the scoring pace for the stars and stripes en route to the medal and, along with fellow Terrier and hometown Bruins prospect Charlie McAvoy, was named to the WJC All-Star team.
Including Keller, five BU forwards have surpassed the 20-point mark this season, and all six of the Terriers’ top scorers are underclassmen. Three premier BU forwards—freshman Patrick Harper, sophomore Bobo Carpenter, and Keller—fail to eclipse the six-foot benchmark. Nevertheless, sophomore Jordan Greenway, towering at 6’5”, more than makes up for his otherwise undersized attack unit.
While racking up goals at a top 20 pace, the Terrier game plan relies on more than just dynamic forward play. Rookie netminder Jake Oettinger provides a stable foundation so well complimented by the army of blueliners in front of him. Oettinger’s top-five save percentage, .936, and four shutouts this season are major contributions to BU’s goals against average of 2.04, good for fourth among all Division I schools.
This year, the Terriers prepare to face off against formidable Green Line rival BC following Harvard’s bout with Northeastern. From a fan’s standpoint, this draw was quite favorable, as Monday night’s clash between these familiar foes has the makings of an instant classic.
Although BU leads the all-time series 132-122-18 dating back to 1918, the Eagles have snagged the past six Beanpot matchups from the Terriers, including four overtime decisions.
NORTHEASTERN
The Huskies (11-11-5, 5-9-3) enter the ’Pot this year as the only unranked team, but their pedestrian record can be deceptive. With hallmark victories over ranked opponents Providence and Minnesota, Northeastern poses a genuine threat to its first adversary, the Crimson. Prior to dropping a close contest to No. 10 UMass Lowell on Friday, the Huskies were riding some positive pre-tournament momentum in the shape of a four-game win streak.
The opening matchup of this year’s Beanpot reeks of offense, as both Harvard and Northeastern are among the top seven Division I programs in scoring. The Huskies’ 3.63 goals per game average speaks to their elite offense.
Junior forward Dylan Sikura is tied for third in the country with 46 points, and two of his teammates, alternate captain Zach Aston-Reese and sophomore Adam Gaudette, are not far behind, both sitting in the top seven. Aston-Reese stands out as one of the league’s premier snipers, as he currently sets the NCAA scoring pace with 22 goals. Additionally, his 11 tallies on the man-advantage contribute heavily to his squad’s second-ranked power play percentage of .268.
Aston-Reese has 14 multi-point performances in this year’s campaign and, in December, became the first ever Huskie to record hat tricks in consecutive games. What’s more: the Hobey Baker award candidate has chipped in three short-handed goals as well, making him a genuine scoring threat in all scenarios.
For this year’s Northeastern team, offense is certainly not a point of concern. The Huskies’ ability to rack up goals against even the strongest competition keeps them close in many games. On the other side of the puck, however, defensive troubles have plagued the team all season, with its 43rd-ranked 3.19 goals against average leaving much to be desired.
Sophomore goaltender Ryan Ruck has been on the receiving end of many of his team’s defensive lapses. In 26 starts, his 3.15 goals against average and .890 save percentage paint the picture of Northeastern’s fast-paced, offensive-minded style.
Northeastern has a tendency to rely on its stars—sometimes to a fault—as point production drops off steeply after its top tier of skaters. Sikura, Aston-Reese, and Gaudette, along with junior blue-liner Garret Cockerill and captain John Stevens, account for just about two-thirds of the Huskies’ scoring on the season. Harvard will look to capitalize on this apparent lack of depth in its matchup on Monday night.
Of its three Beanpot rivals, Northeastern has performed the best against Harvard, going 20-23 all-time, despite never facing the Crimson in a finals match. The Huskies, approaching 29 years without a title, hope to improve upon their 38-90 overall tournament record and bring home a fifth victory in Boston’s time-honored classic.
While Beanpot frontrunner and one-time No. 1 BU dropped two games in late January to unranked Merrimack, Northeastern handled its back-to-back versus the Warriors with ease, so perhaps the title is truly for the taking. Monday night could see more of the same parity, this time at the Crimson’s expense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team’s meet against Yale was supposed to be a competitive affair—a matchup between the two remaining undefeated programs in the Ivy League, featuring some of the conference’s top swimmers. In the end, though, the contest looked more like just another practice for the Crimson.
No. 23 Harvard (10-0, 6-0 Ivy League) lost just six of 19 events, four of them to Bulldogs junior Kei Hyogo, as it swept Yale (9-2, 5-1 Ivy) aside, 225-128, to secure an undefeated season and the Ivy League Dual Championship. This weekend’s victory at the Kiphuth Exhibition Pool in New Haven is the Crimson’s 25th in a row over the Bulldogs, and marks the third time in four years that Harvard has finished the regular season without a loss.
“I think we performed very well this weekend,” freshman Dean Farris said. “We wanted to end the dual meet season on a high note for the seniors, and we were very happy with our results. The guys that were tapered for the meet swam with a lot of passion, and it was great to see some of them get best times.”
Hyogo did prove to be a challenge for the Crimson, taking top marks in the 1650 freestyle, 200 IM, 400 IM, and 500 freestyle. In the 1650 free, the Yale junior touched the wall less than half a second ahead Logan Houck, who finished sixth in the event at Olympic Trials this summer.
However, Hyogo’s efforts would not be nearly enough, as Harvard cruised to the win behind an impressively deep performance. Nine Crimson swimmers picked up victories, compared to just three for Yale, while nine more Harvard athletes collected podium finishes.
The team-wide success that helped guide the team to its 10th win of the season has become standard for the Crimson. Indeed, Harvard’s performance this weekend followed a number of familiar patterns.
The Crimson came out firing, just as it has all year, winning the first five events.
Harvard kicked off the meet with a victory in the 200 freestyle relay, with Farris, sophomore Sebastian Lutz, and juniors Ed Kim and Steven Tan beating out Yale’s ‘A’ lineup for first place.
The next four events were all the Crimson’s. Farris took top marks in the 200 freestyle with a team-record time 1:34.01 of before junior Koya Osada captured first place in the 100 backstroke. Junior Shane McNamara and freshman Daniel Chang would take the top two spots in the 100-meter breaststroke.
Finally, Harvard finished the run with a podium sweep in the 200 butterfly. A quartet of seniors monopolized the top four spots in the final regular meet of their Crimson careers, with Sava Turcanu touching the wall first in pool-record time, followed by Max Yakubovich, Kenneth Castro-Abrams, and Christian Carbone in second, third and fourth, respectively.
“The meet was really fun,” Turcanu said. “We had multiple best times and lots of wins.”
Yale won three events in a row to snap Harvard’s successful run, but the Crimson rebounded by capitalizing in two areas that it has dominated this season: relays and diving.
Junior divers Bobby Ross and David Pfeifer have put in strong performances on the boards all year, and this weekend was no different. Ross took first place in the three-meter event with 337.35 points, and Pfeifer was close behind in second with a score of 328.42.
They repeated the order later in the meet in the one-meter dive, with Ross once more finishing first and Pfeifer one spot back.
Harvard also looked to the team events as it sought to bounce back from the string of Yale wins, and the relay lineups did not disappoint, winning every one of their races to close out a dual season in which the Crimson did not lose a single relay event.
It was the 400 medley relay ‘A’ squad of Osada, McNamara, Yakubovich, and Farris that got the team back on track. The group won the event by over four seconds, beating out the ‘B’ lineup of senor Jack Manchester, co-captain Eric Ronda, Kim, and junior Luke Morgan-Scott, which took second.
Harvard also came away with a win in the 200 medley relay, thanks to strong swimming from Tan, McNamara, Yakubovich, and Lutz.
Finally, the team ended the meet the way it began – with a relay win. Freshman Raphael Marcoux, Yakubovich, Tan, and Farris picked up first place in the 400-meter freestyle relay to put an exclamation point on the Crimson victory.
Marcoux and Farris’ strong performance was just one of many over the course of the meet from the Harvard freshman class, which has picked up decisive results for the team throughout the season.
Farris also chipped in a win in the 100 freestyle, while Marcoux took third in the 50 and 100 freestyle events. Fellow first-year Daniel Chang also took second place in the 200 IM and 200 breaststroke and third in the 400 IM.
The Crimson added to the rookies’ success with a pair of podium sweeps to round out the victory. Osada, Manchester, and Castro-Abrams took the top three spots in that order in the 200 backstroke. In the following event—the 100-meter butterfly—Yakubovich picked up the win ahead of second-place Tan and Lutz in third to replicate the feat.
The meet was Harvard’s final tuneup before the Ivy League Championship, to be held later this month at Blodgett Pool in Cambridge.
“I think the times we posted this weekend set us up very well for Ivy's,” Farris said. “We have two and a half more weeks to rest and focus on the details to get ready for the meet.”

For most other sports teams, sweeping the weekend against two of the top eight teams in the nation would be celebrated as a huge accomplishment, or maybe even the highlight of a season. But the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash sees it as something to be expected.
The twin noontime matches at the Murr Center against No. 7 Cornell (8-4, 3-2 Ivy) and No. 8 Columbia (5-5, 1-4) were swept by the Crimson, which played in dual meets with the men’s team. The pair of 9-0 victories by Harvard (8-0, 5-0) continues the team’s two-year undefeated streak of 31 games. The women’s squash squad has now gone four matches without dropping a single matchup.
“Both the men and the women had a really successful weekend. We had a really solid win 9-0 against Columbia yesterday,” co-captain Dileas MacGowan said. “Fairly strong team, sort of similar to Stanford, in their level so it was definitely a good win there. And then Cornell today we had a bit of a tougher match. But everyone definitely stood up to the plate today.”
HARVARD 9, CORNELL 0
Coming into town for the second match of the weekend, No. 7 Cornell served as stiffer competition. The team had come into Cambridge having won four of its last five matches. Harvard’s coaching staff seemed to have forecasted the elevated level of play, starting three of its top players that didn’t play in Saturday’s bout.
In the previous two matches against Columbia and Tufts, the Crimson was able to take every single game in all of the individual match-ups. Freshman Gina Kennedy kept that streak going early in the afternoon with a dazzling rally, overcoming a 10-7 deficit at the second spot by rattling off five straight points to win her match’s first game.
“My opponent played really well,” Kennedy said. “When I was 10-7 down I kind of just relaxed a bit…and just got into the rallies a bit more. Tried to not make as many errors and luckily I managed to scrape my way back in. Got my head together a bit after that and it was better.”
The lone blemish came later as No. 8 sophomore Sophie Mehta was unable to close out her match in the third game, losing 9-11, but closed out it out in the next round.
The theme throughout the season has been to use less competitive games as preparation for marquee matchups. Harvard has experimented with different lineup positions, forcing adversity upon the players so that it can excel in pressure situations.
“You know this was mostly about getting ready for our match on Wednesday against Trinity,” MacGowan said. “So we went into this weekend with the mentality being regardless of how good your opponent may be or may not be we want to focus on really deliberately hitting every shot and going into every single point with the mentality of never letting up…This is going to be our toughest matchup of the year so we definitely feel pretty good after this weekend.”
With just a few matches left in the regular season, the Crimson is playing at a level that makes it the favorites regardless of its opponent. The team has shown great resiliency, not a bad pairing with the team’s extreme talent.
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
Facing the top team in the country, No. 8 Columbia needed all the help that it could get. But with the absence of No. 4 Colette Sultana creating a line-up shift and the overpowering skill of the Crimson, Columbia got swept down in a decisive victory.
Across the board, the lower-ranked Harvard women generally had more decisive victories on Saturday. In past matches, it has often been the Crimson’s top players with the larger margins of victories in the games of their matches.
But at the top of the lineup card there were also some notable items. Harvard, following the example of its previous competition against Tufts, rested three of its higher ranked players, including sophomore Sabrina Sobhy, the team’s No. 1 player. This switch allowed Kennedy to take on arguably the most prominent position in collegiate squash, playing in the No. 1 position on the top women’s team.
“It was fun playing number one, taking Sabrina’s spot,” Kennedy said. “I enjoyed playing number one, but I prefer playing two, probably. It’s a lot more pressure playing at one is what I’m trying to get at. So, I’m glad Sabrina has that spot.”
The match featured few close moments. No. 5 Sophie Mehta played in the only game that went to a tiebreaker, but closed out her match sweep with a 12-10 third game. No. 2 sophomore Kayley Leonard was the only other Crimson athlete to face similar competition, with senior Maya Patel taking at least seven points in all three of their games.
But time and again, when Harvard players have shown some early signs of struggle, they finish up games and matches with long streaks of dominance. So goes the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard skiing team competed this weekend in the third of five carnivals on the Eastern Intercollegiate Skiing Association circuit. On Friday, the team traveled to Stowe, Vt. for the University of Vermont Carnival where it competed against a strong field of skiers to finish 10th out of the 16 EISA teams. Dartmouth won both the alpine event and the overall.
In the Nordic events, senior Rachel Hampton led the way with a top-10 finish in the women’s 10K and 36th place overall in the women’s FS sprint. Freshman Tegan Thorley and sophomore Nina Armstrong also posted two strong finishes apiece.
Thorley was the top Harvard woman in the sprint, coming in 34th just ahead of Hampton, and Armstrong was right behind them in 38th. In the 10K, sophomore Hannah Hardenbergh finished in 30th, just ahead of Thorley in 31st and Armstrong in 37th.
On the men’s side, seniors Devlin Shea and Ian Meyer were the team’s top finishers. Shea led the way in the FS sprint, finishing with a time of 3:22.58 to take 39th place. Meyer was the first Harvard skier to cross the finish line in the 10K, taking 27th place with a time of 31:50.2.
Other notable finishes included freshman William Rhatigan and junior Connor Green who both recorded solid races in both events. In the sprint, Rhatigan finished in 57th and Green 61st. In the 10K, Rhatigan came in 55th and Green finished just after in 58th.
In Friday’s women’s slalom race, junior Kelly Steeves led the alpine team with a 28th place finish and freshman Courtney Clark came in 43rd. The men’s alpine team had its strongest showing of the season so far with junior Pieter Weemaes finishing in 45th followed by freshman Carter Kendig and freshman Robert Dorfman in 46th and 47th, respectively.
“Although competition was particularly tough, the team came through in high spirits,” said men’s alpine captain James Stevenson. “Thrilled with the pace at which we're finding our stride."
Battling snow and low visibility, Steeves was also the leader in the giant slalom race finishing in 34th, followed closely by Clark in 42nd.
“I'm always really impressed with our team's ability to keep their cool when the competition is tough. In particular, Kelly Steeves continues to be dependable,” said women’s alpine captain Katie Gibson. “A lot of the team is right on the cusp of great race performances and I'm excited to see their hard training paying off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They’re on top of the world, well, at least the college squash world. Sitting atop the Dunlop Men’s College Squash Team Rankings for the first time since December 7, 2014 after its win over then-No. 1 Rochester last weekend, the Harvard men’s squash team continued to bowl over the competition.
Still undefeated on the season, the Crimson (9-0, 5-0 Ivy League) solidified its position at the top with dominating victories over No. 3 Columbia (9-2, 4-1) and No. 11 Cornell (6-8, 1-4) in its first home stand of the year. The Lions, led by two-time All-American and 2015-2016 Ivy League player of the year Osama Khalifa, did not live up to the reputation they had built up earlier in the season at the Murr Center on Saturday.
“I think yesterday against Columbia there were some tough matches, but we came out on top for the most part,” freshman Sean Hughes said. “It’s been a good past few weekends for us. Finally playing some of the top teams and coming out on top.”
This time around, Harvard did not just come out on top. It showed that it was a force to be reckoned with, as its wins over Columbia and Cornell, 8-1 and 9-0, respectively, were in no way, shape, or form closer than the final results indicate.
HARVARD, 9, CORNELL, 0
The match on Sunday against the Big Red went relatively routinely, as Harvard collected simple 3-0 victories at the top eight positions. The ninth match took a mere four games.
With Smith and senior Dylan Murray sitting out the match, both sophomore Alexi Gosset and junior Mandela Patrick picked up starts at the eighth and ninth positions, respectively. Gosset’s match went by quickly, while Patrick’s was more contested. He fought through long, draining points and slightly erratic refereeing to secure the win, 11-4, 10-12, 11-7, 11-4.
With another important match against No. 2 Trinity on the horizon, the strength up and down the Crimson ladder must continue to prove itself.
“This team is going to compare, maybe, to some of the strongest teams that Harvard’s had in recent history, especially with the one where we won the nationals a few years ago,” Way said. “The fact of the matter is we’re very strong like a few years ago, but so are many other teams, but the important now is just to stay grounded. We have to make sure we stay humble, stay quiet, and don’t get ahead of ourselves.”
HARVARD, 8, COLUMBIA, 1
“The score line tells it all,” seventh-year coach Mike Way said. “I think we and Columbia were surprised at the men’s result yesterday. Very often score lines don’t reflect what actually happened, but I think yesterday’s was fairly accurate. Obviously, as head coach, I’m delighted.”
Nowhere was this dominance more present than at the often-challenging No. 1 position. Freshman Saadeldin Abouaish, blitzed one of the most talented players in the nation in Khalifa, right out of the gate en route to an 11-9, 11-5, 11-1 win. Abouaish continued to gain confidence as the match went on, as the rookie  moved closer to handing Khalifa the second regular season loss of his college career. By the homestretch of the third set, he was clearly dictating the play.
“That could’ve been a breakthrough match for him,” Way said. “First of all, Osama is a very strong player and Saad is only just coming out of juniors. And second of all, in that culture, Egyptian culture, you see it very often where a younger athlete should always be respectful, but is so respectful, that in fact there’s a barrier there to stop him from playing his hardest.”
Having played quite possibly one of the best individual matches of his life, the Cairo native displayed the brilliance that the Crimson has the privilege of receiving for the next three-plus seasons. The match displayed the first-year’s composure, as he didn’t let the moment get away from him.
“He had two barriers to get through yesterday,” Way said. “One was tactical and one was humility, playing this elder statesmen, if you will. So I said to him ‘the test that you have today has to do with these two things and if you come through it, it will be Saad the man versus Saad the junior boy.’ And I think very much it was a mature performance that we saw from him yesterday.”
Matches were tighter at other positions, but Harvard continued to come out on top with decisive victories. Junior Madahav Dhingra played a contested first game, but proved dominant once he figured out his opponent, winning 12-10, 11-5, 11-4. Freshman Timmy Brownell, co-captain Bryan Koh, and co-captain Devin McLaughlin produced the other three-game victories for the Crimson.
Playing right next to each other on courts four and five, Hughes and senior Dylan Murray collected their own victories, 3-1. Junior David Ryan also prevailed in four, besting Lions sophomore Adham Madi in his customary methodical style, 8-11, 11-6, 11-8, 11-3. After a slow start to the first game set him back early in the match, Ryan gradually brought himself back into the game with consistent rails and drops. After placing his stamp on the third game with a skillful behind the back volley at the front of the court, Ryan pull ahead for good.
The lone loss on the day came from junior Bradley Smith at the second position. The 3-0 defeat was much closer than it seemed, as a back-and-forth 16-14 second set came to define the contest between the two adversaries.

Donald Trump has been President of the United States for two weeks, and, according to a recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University, his approval rating is already sitting at a 36 percent. If 36 percent were a grade at Harvard and grade inflation was accounted for, that would still be woefully low. Thankfully (especially for all the tuition-paying parents out there), our fair college boasts a comprehensive list of things that have a higher approval rating than Donald Trump. Here’s a non-comprehensive rundown of things that make the list.
HUDS Sweet Potato Fries: No matter how terrible of a state our lives is in at any given point, if there are sweet potato fries on the HUDS menu, our day instantly gets better.
Economics 1011b: Just look at that sexy Q score of a 3 out of 5. Admire it. Recognize that the 3.0 probably also reflects the number of students who get an A in the course. Take it for your EMR requirement anyway.
The  semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine: This is saying a lot, considering that the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine is, well, just that. They should have comped Flyby instead.
The New Omni App: The original Omni was a bit of a flop, but hey, this updated one comes with a food truck schedule and a better shuttle tracker. It's perfect for Quadlings and those crazy people who have lined up five consecutive hours of class on Wednesdays.
Tatte: Forget the fact that it's basically impossible to get a seat here, ever. Tatte and its Insta-worthy aesthetic makes this place worthy of all of the praise.
Unrecognized Single-Gender Social Organizations: Forget the sanctions. Even Dean Khurana seems to be giving them a second thought. In fact, a whopping 60% of students voted in favor or repealing the sanctions in the most recent UC election.
Next time you’re suffering through a class with a terrible Q score or bemoaning the fact that you’re a prospective Class of 2021er who wants to be in the Fly(by) Club but also wants to get that Rhodes scholarship, just remind yourself that your chances are probably still higher than Trump’s approval rating.
