After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 31, The Crimson’s Editorial Board published the editorial “Kenneth Roth: The One that (Almost) Got Away,” celebrating Kenneth Roth’s fellowship appointment to the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and lambasting Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf’s initial withdrawal of the fellowship offer.
On multiple occasions, Kenneth Roth has claimed that donor-driven censorship led to Harvard’s decision to rescind his fellowship offer from the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. “If anybody was in a position to not let donors dictate,” he told The Crimson, “ — or not let donors censor — topics of academic inquiry, it would be Harvard.”
Neither Roth, however, nor his most ardent supporters on campus have marshaled any evidence documenting the alleged plot by moneyed interests to censor him and hobble academic freedom.
To the contrary, Elmendorf specifically stated in an email to HKS students and staff that the “decision was not influenced by donors.”
I am troubled by the persistent use of clichéd antisemitic dog whistles and canards in Roth’s claims surrounding his rescinded fellowship. I would have expected the so-called “godfather” of human rights to be more cautious about perpetuating harmful antisemitic myths and conspiracy theories. One need not have a Ph.D. in Human Rights to recognize the dog whistles Roth continues to amplify.
In my view, once the Carr Center offered Roth the fellowship, Dean Elmendorf should have simply stayed mum. Instead, by compelling HKS to retract the appointment, and then, under public pressure, reversing his veto, the hullabaloo attracted far more publicity than the initial appointment would have otherwise generated. Did no one at HKS see this mess coming? If ever there was an avoidable controversy.
Roth’s controversial leadership of Human Rights Watch is public record and speaks for itself. There are plenty of reasons, in other words, to question the value he would bring to HKS, without it being part of a covert Zionist conspiracy.
In an interview with The New York Times, Roth admitted he has no evidence of donor-driven censorship. Yet, he continues to allege that pro-Israel donors are in control and intent on blocking his position at HKS.
I share the Editorial Board’s desire for greater transparency with respect to faculty hiring and fellowship appointments, insofar as it might finally lead Roth to put the inflammatory and thinly veiled tropes to bed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The latest example of The Crimson’s antisemitic “boycott Israel” editorial stance spilling over into the news columns of the paper in a way that violates good journalistic craft comes in a news article that says, “In recent weeks, Elmendorf has been the subject of controversy. He faced backlash in January over his rejection of a fellowship for former Human Rights Watch head Kenneth Roth. Elmendorf, who allegedly blocked Roth over anti-Israel criticism, reversed his decision after more than 1,000 Harvard affiliates signed an open letter calling for his resignation.”
The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage entry under “allegedly” calls it “police-blotter jargon, best rephrased into conversational English.” A more accurate, more fair, less biased, and better way of providing this context would have been to either cut the whole section or edit it so that read something like:
“Elmendorf reversed himself last month under pressure from faculty members and allowed a fellowship for Kenneth Roth, a former head of Human Rights Watch. The dean has said the initial rejection was based on his evaluation of Roth’s potential contributions to the school. Roth’s critics, including major American Jewish organizations and a founder of Human Rights Watch, say his criticism of Israel has amounted to an obsessive bias that has crossed into antisemitism, and that the claim made by Roth and his allies, with no evidence, that the fellowship was initially blocked by pro-Israel donors echoes antisemitic conspiracy theories.”
Sprinkling the word “allegedly” into a sentence is not some kind of potion that magically provides a pretense of journalistic objectivity in an article that otherwise unskeptically parrots unsubstantiated claims around Roth’s fellowship. It is better journalism to say who is making the allegation, to check whether they have any evidence to support the claim, and to provide additional, alternative points of view.
It’s ironic that the rest of the Crimson article is about a Harvard project to study misinformation and disinformation. And it’s sad that this sort of anti-Israel, anti-Jewish propaganda is being supported by Crimson alumni donors, insulating the journalists from the feedback mechanisms that would ordinarily help to prevent a newspaper from going off the rails in such an extreme and bigoted way.

In its recent editorial on the controversy surrounding Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf’s decision to block a fellowship for former Human Rights Watch head Kenneth Roth, The Crimson’s Editorial Board took a bold stance, denouncing Elmendorf’s suppression of freedom of speech. However, in its 752-word article, The Crimson mentioned the central issue in the fellowship denial — Roth’s support of Palestinian rights and criticism of Israel — only once.
The Crimson seems to have fallen victim to the same regime of silencing — it is safer, such logic goes, not to talk about “controversial” issues — which it purports to criticize in its article.
The Editorial Board passionately exalts the principle of academic freedom and apologizes to Roth on behalf of the Harvard community, arguing Harvard can make amends by “improving.” However, The Crimson never explains exactly what can be improved. To discuss Elmendorf’s decision without providing context on Harvard’s anti-Palestinian racism and institutional bias towards Israeli policy is to circle the drain on the issue but avoid its actual stakes.
This is more than just another depoliticized conversation about academic freedom. Palestinian and pro-Palestinian voices in the United States and on college campuses are systemically silenced, as recently documented in The Boston Globe and Jewish Currents. The central reason for the fellowship denial remains unaddressed by Harvard and notably absent from Elmendorf’s email, just as it is mentioned in mere passing in The Crimson’s take on the matter.
As Harvard affiliates who advocate for justice in Palestine, we have come to expect the silencing of Palestinian voices as a formative part of our academic experience. Blocked hiring decisions like this one, student and faculty fear of blacklisting on sites like Canary Mission, and mysterious tenure denials are part of a system of keeping Palestinian voices quiet. The stifling may be subtle, as when professors hedge class discussions of Palestine to avoid “controversy,” or more explicit, like when organizers with the Palestine Solidarity Committee were made to turn people away from an already-approved public event due to threats made against our guest speakers and organization. These violations of academic freedom do not occur in a vacuum; they cannot be prevented by an academic freedom policy which does not address the particularities of the Palestinian exception to free speech.
This is exactly why The Crimson’s silence is so ironic. Even in its outrage over a matter of suppression of free speech because of outspokenness in support of Palestinian liberation, The Crimson has managed to paper over Palestine.
In place of the Editorial Board’s vague recommendation for “improvement,” we call on Harvard to take the following steps to address institutional anti-Palestinian racism:
1) Adopt a University-wide policy protecting against anti-Palestinian racism and protecting those with pro-Palestinian views against discrimination: a) In hiring decisions b) In admissions c) In disciplinary proceedings.
2) Amend Dean Elmendorf’s apology regarding Kenneth Roth’s fellowship clarifying that his decision was rooted in suppression of criticism of Israeli policy and disclosure of how the decision was reached.
We thank The Crimson’s Editorial Board for standing up in favor of academic freedom. We hope, though, that next time they choose to weigh in on an issue like this, they take more care not to replicate the same pattern about which they have taken such a lofty moral stance.

Harvard’s campus was rocked by gusting winds and sub-zero temperatures this weekend as an arctic blast cooled the Boston area Friday and Saturday, breaking records for the region.
According to the National Weather Service, the minus 10-degree Fahrenheit low on Saturday morning was the first double-digit negative temperature recorded in Boston since 1957. The rest of the Northeast region saw similarly low temperatures and high wind speeds over the weekend.
Students largely remained indoors through the below-freezing temperatures, ushering in a quiet weekend on campus.
Angela P. Caloia ’23 said avoiding the biting cold took priority over weekend plans for her and her friends.
“We didn’t make any plans when we saw the weather,” Caloia said. “We were like, ‘Okay, Saturday is an indoor night.’”
Nick Y. Gu ’24 said he did not appreciate the “fickle” Boston weather.
“Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Why did I go to this school?’ and this is one of the reasons why I ask myself that question,” Gu said.
The Dean of Students Office sent an email to undergraduates Friday instructing students to wear appropriate clothing in order to avoid “risks associated with prolonged exposure” including “hypothermia and frostbite.”
University shuttle services were expanded over the weekend in order to reduce wait times, according to the email.
Upperclassman house administrators also sent out warnings of their own.
“CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS!!” wrote Lowell House Dean Annie Park in an email to residents Friday. “This is not a joke and can cause really serious damage and life disruptions for many in the house.”
Still, some housing infrastructure did succumb to the cold snap.
Some Winthrop House residents were forced to briefly evacuate into the cold after a pipe burst in Standish Hall Sunday morning, according to an email sent by Winthrop Resident Dean Remei Capdevila Werning.
“It wasn’t the best way to wake up,” said Caloia, a Winthrop House resident.
Residents of The Inn at Harvard were also affected by the extreme cold overnight. Inn resident Andrew C. Nober ’25 woke up at 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning to a burst pipe and blaring fire alarms.
“The fire alarm went off and it was a bunch of water pouring from one of the pipes in the back of the Inn,” Nober said.
“The fire alarm went off two more times before we could go to sleep,” he added.
By Sunday morning, temperatures had risen into the forties, to the relief of many students.
“It was so nice,” said Evie Coxon ’23. “It was like the past few days hadn’t really happened.”

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health published a study on Monday which found that women who followed most aspects of a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and adequate sleep, had a reduced risk of contracting long Covid-19.
Long Covid-19, which affects an estimated eight to 23 million Americans, is defined by persistent symptoms from the virus four weeks or more after initial infection. These symptoms can include fatigue and fever, as well as an array of respiratory, heart, neurological, and digestive symptoms.
The research findings, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, were announced in an HSPH press release Monday morning.
“Our findings raise the possibility that adopting more healthy behaviors may reduce the risk of developing long Covid-19,” Andrea L. Roberts ’88, a senior author of the study, said in the release.
The study examined data collected from over 32,000 female nurses in the Nurses’ Health Study II — a project founded to investigate the long-term consequences of oral contraceptives, diet, and lifestyle risk factors in women between 25 and 42 years old. The researchers analyzed lifestyle data collected through the study in 2015 and 2017, as well as data on reported history of Covid-19 infection from April 2020 to November 2021.
Healthy lifestyle was defined by six factors: healthy body weight, not smoking, regular exercise, adequate sleep, high-quality diet, and moderate alcohol consumption. The two factors researchers found were most strongly correlated with a reduced risk of long Covid-19 were maintaining a healthy body weight and sleeping seven to nine hours per night.
Among women who developed long Covid-19, a healthier pre-infection lifestyle was associated with a 30 percent lower risk of having symptoms that interfered with their daily life. Additionally, women with five or six healthy lifestyle factors had a 49 percent lower risk of contracting long Covid-19 compared to women with no healthy lifestyle factors, according to the study.
The study complements prior research findings that an unhealthy lifestyle can lead to an increased risk of chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation — both of which have been associated with an increased risk of long Covid-19.
“In the U.S. for example, 70% of the population do not have a healthy body weight and 30% do not sleep enough.” Siwen Wang, a lead author on the study, said in the press release. “Findings from this study suggest that simple lifestyle changes, such as having adequate sleep, may be beneficial for the prevention of long Covid-19.”

Following the closure of all four locations of Darwin’s Ltd. late last year, a small group of former employees has announced plans to open a worker-owned cafe at the former Darwin’s location on Cambridge St.
The proposal for Circus Co-op was conceived in November, when it was announced that Darwin’s would be closing its first location. Since then, the group of ex-Darwin’s employees has focused on fundraising and learning more about a possible future location on Cambridge St.
Kvêten A. Nerudova, a former Darwin’s employee and member of Circus Co-op, said the name of their group “honors what we saw Darwin’s as.”
“Darwin’s is sort of like a circus,” they said. “People come in from all different backgrounds. People come in because they’ve got to work.”
“It was always busy. It was always fun. It was always bustling,” they added.
Nerudova said the cooperative will seek to advance many of the same goals as Darwin’s United — the former employee union for Darwin’s Ltd. — which was founded on the principle of giving employees a “greater say in the way our workplace is run,” Nerudova said.
“We’re trying to take a look at what the union was aiming for,” Nerudova said, though they added that “the union is definitely in the past.”
Caleb S. Zedek, a member of Circus Co-op, said though a full menu has not been built, the new cafe would likely serve breakfast sandwiches and coffee.
The Circus Co-op also has “aspirational” plans for the cafe to become a “community space,” Zedek said, mentioning the possibility of poetry nights and study sessions.
Currently, there are four people who are involved in the “heavier work” of the cooperative, Nerudova said, adding that the cafe would need 12 to 15 workers to be fully staffed.
Zedek said the Co-op’s organizers expect more employees will join the cooperative as business operations pick up.
“Members of the cooperative have sort of been just in a transitional period,” Nerudova said. “It’s a month out from a job that many of us saw as being something we could hold for a lot longer.”
As part of their fundraising efforts, the Circus Co-op launched a GoFundMe campaign on Dec. 16, which had raised more than $10,000 from supporters as of Sunday night.
The cooperative’s organizers will match up to $10,000 in donations, according to the GoFundMe — money which would come out of members’ savings, Zedek said.
Ahead of its launch, the Circus Co-op is undergoing the loan application processes for two organizations that help finance worker-owned businesses — the Cooperative Fund of the Northeast and the Fund for Jobs Worth Owning. The organizers have also talked to nearby cooperatives, including Providence-based White Electric Coffee.
“Worker-owned co-ops can vary based on their size and structure, but at the foundation there should be democracy and transparency,” Chloe Chassaing, a worker-owner at White Electric, wrote in an emailed statement.
“Worker-owned cooperatives have a potential to be an alternative business model toward a more sustainable economy,” Chassaing added.
While steps remain toward incorporating and financing the new cafe, Zedek said, he is confident Circus Co-op will be able to attract many former Darwin’s customers.
“I imagine that many of the folks who were excited to see us at the register making our sandwiches are still the folks who would be excited to see us come back into the same space,” he said.

At a Saturday general meeting, the Harvard Undergraduate Association unveiled initiatives to allocate funding for diversity-related events and subsidies to alleviate expenses for undergraduates.
The HUA announced that they are planning to allocate $5,000 this semester for subsidizing student organizations hosting events celebrating diversity. Applications will open next week with a deadline the following week.
Officers also unveiled a new program designed to alleviate the costs associated with doing laundry. The program would divide $2,000 of laundry detergent between the roughly 45 laundry rooms in Harvard’s undergraduate dorms, HUA residential life officer David Y. Zhang ’23 said.
To further alleviate the costs associated with college, officers voted in favor of expanding their $50 book stipend to all 239 students who applied for the program.
“So often students have needs on this campus that cannot be fully met, whether that is in financial aid or with club funding,” LyLena D. Estabine ’24 said. “I think that in this way, in this project, where students were confident enough to say to us, ‘Hey, I need help in this regard,’ and we have the capacity to help them, that we should do that.’”
During the general meeting, HUA officers responded to complaints regarding inadequate club funding.
“For spring 2023 semesterly funding, we received about 189 applications. That’s notably around 44 more from last semester, totaling about $950,000 in requests, and we only have $165,500 to distribute for this cycle,” HUA Finance Officer Alexander J. Zurovec ’25 said. “So, the same as last semester — we’re going to be making sweeping funding cuts.”
In an effort to encourage more freshmen to become involved in the HUA, officers are launching a pilot First-Year Team this semester, ahead of a referendum vote this election cycle on the creation of a permanent First-Year Team. This pilot team, open for all first-years to join, will be led by the co-presidents. The HUA plans to send out an email recruiting student volunteers.
“A team like this could help support the first-year community and help more first-years feel that they are welcome on the HUA and get more of a sense of wanting to be involved,” Estabine said. “Why should we wait until the spring to try it out and see how it goes, especially since Travis and I are already willing to work and trying to get more first-years involved?”

Harvard Law School professor Daphna Renan gave a critique of judicial supremacy — the idea that the Supreme Court is the final authority on the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution — at an event on Thursday.
Renan delivered the inaugural lecture, hosted by the Law School, as the newly appointed Peter B. Munroe and Mary J. Munroe Professor of Law. Thursday’s lecture previewed a new book Renan is co-writing with fellow HLS professor Nikolas “Niko” Bowie.
Renan began by expressing support for “porous legalism,” or a more flexible legal system that would de-emphasize the separations between the judicial, executive, and legislative branches and diffuse the role of legal interpretation between the courts and different political actors.
“This more porous moral and legal and political and policy judgment can be quite valuable, especially in contexts where there really aren’t clear legal answers and the humanitarian and moral and policy stakes can be quite high,” she said.
In response to the increased power of the Supreme Court, Renan instead argued for “political constitutionalism,” which “does discard of judicial supremacy.”
“It rejects the Court’s authority to have the final say on what the Constitution means or tolerates,” Renan said.
Renan also compared the current state of the U.S. with the Reconstruction era, when abolitionists staunchly opposed the decisions of the Supreme Court. Renan cited the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision — which ruled that formerly enslaved people could not be U.S. citizens — and described how the case angered abolitionists.
“These abolitionists are not only rejecting the supreme authority of the Supreme Court to say what the Constitution is, they’re also rejecting the modes of interpretation that are being used in Supreme Court decisions,” she said.
Renan went on to call the decisions of this era as “a microcosm of things to come.”
“We’ve continued to live in that kind of dangerous state of what happens when we give the Court that kind of power,” she said.
Renan’s lecture was followed by a question and answer session, where an attendee asked Renan about the state of the Supreme Court. Renan described the current Court as the “danger of judicial supremacy run amok,” adding that the appointment of justices to the Supreme Court has become “intoxicated with the politics.”
“The kind of power that we’ve given the Court to decide our most contested, most deeply felt commitments has put a strain on the appointments process that is hard for the appointments process to bear,” Renan said.
“It has led to the current Court that we have that I think is allowing, in particular and in a lot of ways, a really outlier view of what the Constitution means,” she added.

U.S. Representative Bobby C. Scott ’69 (D-Va.) spoke at Harvard Law School about his labor agenda for the 118th Congress on Friday.
The newly-formed Center for Labor and a Just Economy invited Scott to address the Harvard Trade Union Program’s annual John T. Dunlop Memorial Forum, named after former Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and Secretary of Labor John T. Dunlop. The talk honors speakers who have done notable work in industrial and labor relations.
At the forum Friday, which returned this year for the first time since 2020, Scott discussed the current state of the labor movement.
“Ultimately, the labor movement has built a middle class by giving workers a voice on the job,” he said. “And as such, it should be no surprise that unions are popular among the American people.”
Scott also spoke about the challenges faced by the labor movement. According to Scott, while many unions have recently succeeded in organizing, some have faced “a slew of unfair labor practices” and other hurdles.
“The summer of 2022, the General Counsel for the NLRB alleged over 200 violations of the National Labor Relations Act it stopped at the Starbucks locations in Buffalo, New York, alone,” he said. “These violations included firing organizers, closing stores, reducing compensation, and surveilling workers organizing activities.”
Founded by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the National Labor Relations Board governs U.S. labor practices and is composed of a five-member “quasi-judicial body” and a General Counsel, who serves as a prosecutor.
Scott said that “anti-union campaigns” are part of a “growing trend,” saying that according to studies, “87 percent of employers conducted anti-union campaigns during union elections.”
“Many of these employers have gotten away scot-free because the federal agencies do not have the resources needed to adequately enforce labor laws, and when they do get around to enforcing them, the sanctions are sometimes meaningless,” Scott said.
He also spoke about his policy agenda regarding labor issues for the current session of Congress. Scott said he plans to re-introduce the Protect the Right to Organize Act, which was previously passed by the House of Representatives in the 116th and 117th Congresses but was never considered by the Senate.
Among other provisions, the act would bar employers from retaliating against employees who engage in protected activities, such as informing enforcement agencies about potential labor violations and choosing not to perform activities that they believe could constitute a labor violation.
“Specifically, the bill introduces meaningful, enforceable penalties for companies and executives that violate workers’ rights,” he said.
Scott said that he plans to join Congresswoman Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) in re-introducing another bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which addresses the gender pay gap. DeLauro has previously unsuccessfully introduced the bill in the 105th through 117th Congresses.
“Today, women are the sole or co-breadwinner in two-thirds of American families with children,” Scott said. “Yet, after five decades of the Equal Pay Act, the gender gap still presents in nearly every line of work regardless of qualifications or job training, disproportionately harming women of color and children.”
Scott also noted the importance of apprenticeship programs, speaking about his advocacy for the National Apprenticeship Act. The act would authorize the establishment of an Office of Apprenticeship within the Department of Labor, which would promote and provide funding for apprenticeship programs.
In Friday’s talk, Scott said the act would “create an additional one million apprenticeship opportunities.”
“Simply put, the National Apprenticeship Act is good for workers and for communities,” he said.
After his remarks, Scott answered questions from the audience. Kristie R. Bailey, associate executive director of the New York Professional Nurses Union, asked Scott about the exclusion of union staff from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives the student debt of those working in government or for a nonprofit after a number of payments.
Scott responded by saying that expanding debt forgiveness to cover those working in advocacy might allow lobbyists to access the program, though he added that the question of including union staff is “certainly something we’d want to revisit.”
“I did not feel satisfied by the Congressman’s answer,” Bailey said in an interview after the talk, adding that she felt Scott engaged in the “slippery slope logical fallacy” in his answer.
Scott reiterated his goals in an interview after the event.
“There’s a lot of work that needs to be done in labor management and union rights,” he said.

Apsara A. Iyer, a second-year law student at Harvard Law School, was elected the 137th president of the Harvard Law Review, becoming the first Indian American woman to hold the position.
The Law Review, founded in 1887, is among the oldest student-run legal scholarship publications. Previous editors of the organization include Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer, Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as well as former President Barack Obama, who served as the review’s 104th leader.
In the Law School’s Jan. 30 press release, Priscila E. Coronado, Iyer’s predecessor, said the publication is “extremely lucky” to have Iyer at the helm.
“Apsara has changed the lives of many editors for the better, and I know she will continue to do so,” Coronado wrote. “From the start, she has impressed her fellow editors with her remarkable intelligence, thoughtfulness, warmth, and fierce advocacy.”
“I cannot wait to see what Volume 137 will achieve under her leadership,” she added.
Iyer grew up in Indiana and attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. She graduated from Yale in 2016, receiving a bachelor’s degree in Economics and Math as well as Spanish.
In an interview with The Crimson, Iyer discussed her interest in “the relationship between communities living around archaeological sites and the management of cultural heritage,” which began in high school and continued throughout college.
Her interest in understanding the “value of cultural heritage” led her to work in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Antiquities Trafficking Unit, which tracks stolen works of art and other artifacts. She began working in the office in 2018 before attending the Law School, and she took a leave of absence after her first year studying law to return to the role.
Iyer joined the Harvard Law Review following a competitive process called “write-on,” where HLS students rigorously fact-check a document and provide commentary on a recent State or Supreme Court Case.
Iyer spoke highly of her experience and peers at the Law Review.
“What’s been so meaningful to me is that the Law Review has been an amazing community of incredibly talented, passionate people,” Iyer said. “And I feel like I’ve been able to be welcomed into this organization that’s filled with individuals who are so intelligent and so interested in different parts of the law.”
Iyer said that as Law Review president, she aims to include more editors in the process of reviewing and selecting articles and upholding the publication’s reputation for “high-quality” work.
“I think that right now I’m just focused on making sure we keep the lights on and everything going,” Iyer said.
Outside of the Law Review, Iyer has previously been involved in the Law School’s Harvard Human Rights Journal and the National Security Journal. She is also a member of the South Asian Law Students Association. In addition, she serves on the advisory committee for the Peabody Institute of Archaeology in Andover, Massachusetts.
Iyer is working on an independent paper with Law School professor Jacob E. Gersen on the destruction of cultural heritage as a type of tort — a class of civil wrongs involving injury or harm.
Iyer said she is a “nontraditional student” and is unsure of her plans after graduating from HLS.
“I hope to use the rest of my 2L and 3L years to figure out what parts of the law interest me more and do really good work there,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martin Luther King III — a civil rights advocate and the eldest son of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King — discussed the importance of love in fostering a “beloved community” during a Thursday event.
Social Sciences professor Brandon M. Terry ’05 moderated the conversation, which was held in Sanders Theatre. The event was hosted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging as part of its inaugural celebration of the lives of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King throughout the month of February.
According to Terry, the title of the conversation — “Our Beloved Community” — comes from the “political commitments and sacrifices” that the couple supported.
Referencing his father’s speech, “Love Your Enemies,” which was delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church on Nov. 17, 1957, King explained the importance of loving others regardless of differences.
“He said ultimately the highest level of love was defined by the word ‘agape,’ that you love someone if they’re old or young, rich or poor, Black or white, Native American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian — does not matter,” King said. “You love them because God told him to do that.”
King advocated for spreading love, not anger, to “help people to see that which is right and just.”
“What I do know is when we are angry and frustrated, you cannot really think strategically in terms of the highest level of what you want to achieve,” he said.
“Forgiveness is not for them — it’s for you,” he added.
During the event, King reflected on the legacy of Coretta Scott King, who was an honorary chair for an organizing campaign for 1199 Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East and played a significant role in advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights.
“Mom was the person who pulled together a team,” he said.
King also discussed his father’s legacy of civil disobedience and referenced the 1955-56 Montgomery Bus Boycott.
“It starts with unity, which unfortunately, we don’t have enough of,” King said. “This is not about segregation and separation. This is about uplifting for the better of all the communities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On one of the coldest nights on record in the Boston area, the No. 8 Harvard men’s ice hockey team suited up to try to tame the No. 2 Quinnipiac Bobcats at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Though the score may not have reflected the true competitiveness of the matchup between two of the nation’s top teams, the Bobcats came out on top, shutting out the Crimson 3-0.
Through the record low temperatures, many fans braved the cold, making for another sold-out game with a lively student section. One notable attendee was nine year-old Parker Watson, who signed a contract with the team earlier this week through Harvard Athletics’ partnership with Team IMPACT. Team IMPACT is a non-profit organization that pairs children suffering from serious illnesses and disabilities with collegiate sports teams. Within Harvard Athletics, 15 children have been signed to 12 different teams, including men’s basketball and men’s lacrosse.
“It allows us to put in perspective how lucky we are and [how great it is] to have someone that shows up with a big smile…having kids myself, it's great to see our kids connect with Parker. I feel like college kids can connect with younger kids in a way that's really special,” head coach Ted Donato said. “Our guys really enjoy the opportunity to work with Parker.”
Heading into Friday night, Harvard knew it was going to be difficult to curb the Bobcats. Quinnipiac has spent the majority of the season in the top five of the national rankings, and their starting goaltender Yaniv Perets currently boasts a .833 winning percentage in 27 games, which ranks first in the country, as well as a .922 save percentage, which ranks among the nation’s elite as well.
“Perets is obviously really a goalie. His numbers speak for themselves,” said senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun. “They're obviously a very good defensive team as well. I think that helps [Perets] out a lot but I don't think we changed our game much for it.”
From the puck drop, it became clear that the game would be a battle of the neutral zone. Offensive pushes came in bursts, but neither team had consistent time in their opponent’s zone. The Crimson had their first offensive spurt around five minutes into the first, putting up eight shot attempts within 90 seconds. However, only two of the shots were on goal, with three of the other six blocked by Bobcat skaters.
“I thought maybe we could have done a little better job to get some pucks through from the point than they did,” Donato said. “There was one shift early in the game, we kind of had a good offensive zone shift going and they blocked four shots back to back in an even strength rally… I give [Quinnipiac] a lot of credit for that.”
Quinnipiac responded to the Crimson’s early push, creating offensive opportunities right away. Halfway through the period, in the midst of a long Bobcat possession in the Harvard zone, senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson was faced with two shots at point blank range, but denied both. After Gibson covered the puck post save, senior forward and captain Baker Shore won the resulting face-off and cleared the puck from the Crimson defensive zone. The remainder of the period remained tightly contested, and after a failed Harvard power play and a holding penalty called on Shore with just under 15 seconds remaining, the teams ended the first period in a scoreless tie.
Coming into the second period with nearly two minutes of power play time remaining, Quinnipiac came out fast. After winning the opening faceoff, the Bobcats were able to maintain possession in the Crimson zone. Working the puck around quickly, Quinnipiac’s offense was a step ahead of Harvard’s defense. The Bobcats finally got a shot on net, and while Gibson initially rejected Quinnipiac captain Zach Metsa’s rocket, he failed to corral the rebound, and forward Skyler Brind’Amour put the puck in the open net to give the Bobcats a 1-0 advantage.
Harvard was granted its second power play of the night nine minutes into the period, when Bobcats forward T.J. Friedmann was called for holding, as he prevented junior forward Sean Farrell from capitalizing on an open goal. This prompted Donato to start with the second power play unit. During its two minute advantage, the Crimson did not put up a single shot. It was completely neutralized, as Quinnipiac’s aggressive penalty kill prevented the unit from being able to set up the point.
The team would get another chance at the power play just a couple minutes later with Friedmann in the box again, this time for tripping. The first power play unit started this time, and while Harvard put up multiple shots on goal in the two minute stretch, it was again unable to execute.
“We're gonna have to continue to adapt with it. Teams, obviously at this point of the year, do a lot of pre-scouting and sort of know our go-to plays,” explained Thrun regarding the power play’s struggles. “It's something that we're going to have to continue to evolve. We're going to want to make a playoff run and win some key games down the stretch here – special teams need to be huge for us.”
The Crimson entered the third down one goal and put up its best effort to even the score, outshooting Quinnipiac 11-6. However, the Bobcats’ defense and Perets snuffed out any comeback attempt. After a failed power play, Quinnipiac maintained possession and added another to its tally after a Christopher Fillion shot ricocheted off of first-year forward Casey Severo’s skate, past Gibson and into the goal.
In the remaining 10 minutes, Harvard was unable to come back from the 2-0 Bobcat lead. Donato pulled Gibson with just under three minutes remaining, giving the Crimson the extra sixth attacker. Harvard was barely able to put up five shots during this time, Friedmann added an empty-netter with only four seconds left to play.
“I thought Quinnipiac made it tough through the neutral zone – it was kind of back and forth where both teams would get some opportunities,” said Donato of the game as a whole. “They're an excellent team. They don't beat themselves. They make you work forever...it’s a learning experience for us and we have to get better.”
The Crimson was without its typical Saturday game, as its schedule allowed for extra rest ahead of the first round of the Beanpot on Monday. The annual four-team tournament will be played for the 70th time this year, bringing all the powerhouses of Boston’s collegiate hockey scene to the same bracket.
Harvard will take on Boston College in the first game at 5:00 pm at T.D. Garden, the home of the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics. The second game of the night will follow at 8:00 pm, as No. 3 Boston University will face Northeastern University. The victors will compete in the finals the following Monday at 7:30, while the consolation game is at 4:30 pm.
The competition is a pre-playoffs highlight of every Harvard hockey season, fostering excitement from players, coaches, and fans alike.
“It's a bit bittersweet,” said Thrun, a Southborough, Mass. native and who will play in his last Beanpot with the team. “It's such a unique experience, but at the end of the day, I’ve yet to play in that championship Monday and I’ve yet to lift the trophy…we're focused on BC first, but obviously we have bigger goals in mind as well.”
Harvard hasn’t taken home the trophy since 2017, and tied for third with Boston College last year.
“We win together and we lose together and this game probably showed us that we can be a little harder on pucks and we'll need to raise our compete level,” Donato said. “We’ve got a real good challenge for us on Monday night against a BC team that's playing some good hockey. We need to take a deep breath and move on from tonight's game and get ready for Boston College.”

If you have ever met me, you know I am a rather archetypal English student. So much so, in fact, that I am in my fourth semester at this university, and the largest lecture I have ever attended was 80 students. Recently, it was brought to my attention that this is not the experience of a typical Harvard student. So, I decided to check out a big lecture just to see what I was missing.
On Friday, Feb. 3, in the record-breaking cold, I trekked to the Science Center to attend Life Sciences 1B, a class that I understood to be full of hundreds of depressed premeds. I walked into Science Center B, where I encountered truly every freshman I know.
Immediately, I was impressed with the production value — a GIF fire was roaring on the projector screen and some fun music was playing. The professor was dancing around in the front. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad. But then, I saw the lecture topic was gene editing.
I sat down near the back so as to remain inconspicuous. Suddenly, I panicked: I haven’t done the reading! But the lecture was about to begin. Here are my thoughts throughout the lecture, in real time:
1:31 p.m.
“You could have gone to a different school.” — The professor. Yikes. I mean, true. Also, this is a truly crazy number of people all in one class.
1:33 p.m.
Why is everyone talking? Why is everyone on their phones? This does not happen in seminars. I’m scared.
1:35 p.m.
The professor keeps walking up into the aisles and it seems ominous. Is he going to cold call? I, again, am not actually in this class.
1:40 p.m.
Someone in my row is raising her hand. The professor either hasn’t seen her, or he did and didn’t call on her. She’s been raising her hand for several minutes. I feel bad for her.
1:43 p.m. 
HE SAW HER! Why is he running away…. WHY IS HE THROWING A YELLOW CUBE AT HER?!
1:44 p.m.
Oh. It’s a microphone. And she caught it! Go her. I would never catch it. I would never ask a question in this class, because I’d be scared about not catching the cube.
1:53 p.m.
Apparently we are not messing with heritable genome editing, which I think means no eugenics. Good.
1:54 p.m.
“Maybe down the road, but not now,” was the final word on heritable gene editing. Uh oh.
2:01 p.m.
I’ve finally pinpointed what this experience is reminding me of. This lecture has Ted Talk energy.
2:02 p.m.
We’re talking about antibodies. Ooof. Wait — the professor just did a little voice pretending to be the coronavirus. I appreciate the theatrics. It did not get nearly enough of a laugh. To be fair, I didn’t laugh.
2:04 p.m.
The Wi-Fi in this room is so bad, because several hundred people are on their laptops and iPads and phones all at the same time. I’m just trying to load my little magazine to read because this class is so boring.
2:06 p.m.
The professor asked for an example of a palindrome and about a hundred people yelled “RACE CAR!” at him.
2:10 p.m.
He asked for a drum roll and nobody gave him one. :(
2:16 p.m.
Oh my god. He said there would be a question and everybody pulled out their phones. Does this question count for points? This seems kind of high stakes. A bunch of people are wearing white hats right now and walking around, asking people what they think the answer is. Cult vibes, for sure.
2:18 p.m. 
It’s over. That was harrowing.
2:27 p.m.
“What’s the point of bringing back [d0d0s] if their habitat is gone? Probably good eating.” — The professor.
2:30 p.m.
It has taken an hour for the novelty to wear off. I’m ready to leave. I think the people behind me are also ready to leave. They’re passing TikToks back and forth.
2:34 p.m.
I just saw the craziest GCal of all time on the girl in front of me’s computer. There’s a whole day where I only see one tiny sliver of white space. It’s color-coded in extremely bright primary colors. I’m scared.
2:35 p.m.
Another question, but it’s an all-of-the-above situation. Even I know this one.
2:41 p.m. 
Basically everybody is talking even though the lecture is still going. Am I going insane? I want this freedom! But also I think I’d die if everybody talked through all my classes.
2:44 p.m.
OMG he just mentioned a book! “Brave New World.” Maybe we all aren’t so different after all <3.
2:45 p.m.
Everybody just started to leave and then he told them to stay. Yeah. Maybe classes aren’t all so different.
Well, I can only say that this has been an… enlightening experience. I’m happy I chose peace and don’t have to take giant classes like this. If you can’t avoid them, my heart goes out to you. Time to go back to the lovely Barker Center where the vibes are good and I get to discuss fun little books with my fifteen closest friends!

Actress Jennifer Coolidge was honored as the Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year on Saturday. After parading down Massachusetts Ave. and through Harvard Square, Coolidge was honored and roasted at Farkas Hall.
Coolidge is paraded down Mass. Ave. in a Bentley convertible. The procession started near the Harvard Inn and ended at Farkas Hall.
A sea of spectators gathers in Harvard Square despite sub-zero temperatures and record wind chill.
Members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals dress in drag and various flamboyant costumes to accompany Coolidge in the parade.
In a parade tradition, students throw a stuffed animal from a Fairfax Hall window for Coolidge to catch.
Coolidge recently starred as Tanya McQuoid-Hunt in the HBO series “The White Lotus,” winning a 2022 Primetime Emmy Award and a 2023 Golden Globe Award for her role.
Onlookers hold homemade signs supporting the actress.
Lyndsey R. Mugford ’23 and Nikita Nair ’24, president and vice president of Hasty Pudding Theatricals, flank Coolidge in the Bentley.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals present Coolidge with her Woman of the Year award at the doorstep of Farkas Hall. The Woman of the Year Award is the Pudding’s oldest honor, dating back to 1951. Past recipients include Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, and last year, Jennifer Garner.
Coolidge then joins the company in ten high-kicks, marking the conclusion of the parade and announcing the premier of HPT 174: Cosmic Relief! later in the evening.
