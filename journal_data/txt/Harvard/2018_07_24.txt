After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nina Browning learns the hard way that “sometimes you just can’t see the things that are the closest to you” when she discovers her teenage son has taken an inappropriate picture of a girl passed out at a party and sent it to his friends with a racist caption. Emily Giffin’s newest novel, “All We Ever Wanted,” explores relationships between parents and children who are both survivors and perpetrators of sexual violence and harassment. Giffin’s talent for taking on unique perspectives and delving into sensitive yet important subjects makes this novel a thought-provoking read. “All We Ever Wanted” falls flat only at the end—but maybe because we as a society are still trying to figure out how the stories of both survivors and perpetrators should end.
Giffin takes on many hot-button issues in this novel, but her focus is sexual violence and its close ties with entitlement and wealth. Nina’s son is accused of taking an inappropriate photo of a minor named Lyla, and Nina is horrified as a mother, as a woman, and as a survivor of sexual assault. She worries that her husband’s elitist attitudes have fostered an environment in which her son, Finch, believes he can have whatever he pleases. Still, Nina doesn’t only blame her husband: She apologizes many times to Lyla and her father, admitting to them, “I’m his mother. I should have taught him better.”
“All We Ever Wanted” takes a nuanced look at all those affected by these situations, including the survivor’s and perpetrator’s loved ones. Nina feels immense disgust at her husband’s lack of guilt, and Lyla’s father is devastated by the way his daughter has been treated. Lyla’s father is stuck between his “daughter’s pleading eyes and tone” as she begs him not to make a big deal out of the incident and his need to show his daughter that she deserves justice. Giffin accurately portrays the Catch-22 that so many survivors face: to speak publicly in hope of justice and at the risk of social consequences, or to try to heal privately while the perpetrator remains unpunished.
“All We Ever Wanted” is written from three points of view: Nina Browning, Lyla, and Lyla’s father, Tom. Giffin expertly captures the voice of three very different narrators. Lyla is a teenager and therefore her language is more colloquial, using slang such as “low-key” and starting a sentence with “anyway” after long tangents. Tom’s chapters perfectly embody a father struggling to understand his teenage daughter, while reconciling his inability to fully connect with Lyla and his insistent belief that he knows what’s best for her. Nina is aware of the privileged world she lives in, often making statements about the society she is a part of. Giffin’s ability to write such distinct voices is impressive given the scope of these perspectives.
Unfortunately, the ending is abrupt and vague—namely, Finch’s hearing is skipped and summarized. But perhaps this is not a fault on Giffin’s part but rather a reflection of our society. Because there is no general consensus on how harshly perpetrators of sexual harassment, such as Finch’s inappropriate picture-taking, should be punished, there is no predictable happy ending for Giffin to employ. Take the case of Brock Turner, a Stanford student who committed sexual assault in 2015. Many were outraged that he was only sentenced to six months (and released after serving only three), while others complained his jail time was, as his father wrote in a letter, “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action.” Perhaps skipping over the moments where punishment was decided says more about society’s lack of consensus on the issues of sexual violence than it does Giffin’s writing. Regardless, the final chapters raise questions that are not easily answered about punishment and consequences.
Even with a somewhat unsatisfactory ending, Giffin has managed to write a story that is thought-provoking, gut-wrenching, and, at times, heartwarming. Giffin has taken a deeper look into a sensitive topic, leaving readers to think a little harder about the current climate surrounding sexual assault.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indie folk band Fleet Foxes gave their fans the chance to experience the sensation of thousands of their comrades singing the songs they’d otherwise likely never gotten to sing with anyone else  that during their headlining set on Saturday, July 21 at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. The band packed their setlist with top tracks off albums released at the height of their career. It was clear that they didn’t want to deviate from what their followers know and love.
Though The Westerlies, a brass quartet, joined Fleet Foxes onstage for their set, their performance faithfully replicated what you hear on the band’s studio releases. Swells that normally rely on guitars and cymbal crashes felt a little grander, but the brass flourishes often got buried under jangle cacophonies. Amplified stage sound also prevented frontman Robin Pecknold from sounding like he was singing into an empty marble room, which is the effect of the crisp, echo-heavy sound mixing characteristic of Fleet Foxes’ albums. Other than these small differences, the performance did not deviate from those recordings. As he played, Pecknold appeared tightly wound, as if he were intently focused on executing the songs flawlessly.
The band opened to a relatively quiet crowd with songs mainly from their most recent album, “Crack-Up.” The audience’s energy didn’t pick up until the sixth song, when they busted out fan favorites like “White Winter Hymnal,” which glimmered with fairy tale magic. That’s when the iPhones came out. The thousands of festival-goers entered into collective catharsis spurred by their shared love for the music, and sang along with the familiar-sounding and universally singable (or at least hummable) melody. The enthusiasm continued on the band’s subsequent performance of another smash hit, “Ragged Wood,” which was released with “White Winter Hymnal” on their debut self-titled LP in 2008. The band’s other two biggest hits— “Blue Ridge Mountains,” known for its haunting and addictive piano riff, and “Mykonos,” whose catchiness alone is probably why it’s so famous—were strategically placed equidistant from the middle of the set during the second half of the performance. It felt weirdly cynical to evenly distribute excitement across the set (minus the opening “warm up” phase) by building it at calculated apexes—but, hey, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to please an audience.
Fleet Foxes’ career has had a weird trajectory. They exploded onto the indie rock scene 10 years ago with two releases in one year: the “Sun Giant” EP, followed by the full-length “Fleet Foxes,” both of which were stacked with wildly popular songs. Three years later, they came out with “Helplessness Blues,” which had a few well-known songs, but was nowhere near as successful as its predecessor. Fleet Foxes then disappeared for six years, until they came out with “Crack-Up.” By last year, however, they lost the reputation they had the decade prior.
Bands don’t exist for the purpose of being popular, but there’s something a bit unfortunate about Fleet Foxes’ relationship with fame. Their fanbase loves them, but the majority doesn’t seem loyal enough to recognize more than a few songs—maybe that’s just the nature of listening to music these days, or a result of all the songs sounding the same. This became clear when the band set itself up for the obligatory encore, walking offstage three minutes before the set’s official end. After a short period of scattered cheers and hesitant standing, Pecknold sauntered back out and played a song that wasn’t quite popular enough, and therefore garnered nominal enthusiasm—let’s hope the delight built by the last string of hits compensated for this weak ending.

Paul Cherry
Hearts throbbed across Union Park during Saturday’s kickoff set, starring bedroom pop heartthrob Paul Cherry. Cherry could be the next big thing. He’s got Mac DeMarco’s suave, sexy smoothness. He’s got Cuco’s infectious synths and laidback energy. And his art school chicness—a few degrees more palatable than Gus Dapperton’s—is the cherry on top. Each addictive love song melts with mellifluous melodies, from Cherry’s precious falsetto in “This High” to the goofy synth opening of “Your Letter” (which sounds like it could have been written and performed by Ariel Pink). Throughout the performance, Cherry garnished his already adorable songs with even more adorable dance moves and commentary—when one fan, overcome with infatuation, screamed, “I LOVE YOU, PAUL!” he said, “Thanks, Mom!” with a little smirk that said, “I know I’m cute.” Cherry’s bashful charm is so natural that it’s hard to watch him without giggling to yourself a little. When Cherry dedicated his song “Cherry Emoji” to his girlfriend, an audible moan of disappointment sounded throughout the crowd.
Moses Sumney
“Agh, Moses. Come on, Moses. SING!”
This audience member couldn’t contain himself long enough to make it through Moses Sumney’s opening number, the irresistible “Don’t Bother Calling,” without crying out. Sumney’s falsetto will do that you. The man has the voice of an angel—and, trust me, I would not have used that awful cliché if it weren’t true. Performing at Pitchfork on Saturday, he sang just as flawlessly as he did on his debut full-length album, “Aromanticism.” Sumney’s perfect voice is concentrated with so much beauty and feeling that watching him gives a feeling of lightheadedness with awe and respect. He took his performance very seriously, making sure not just to hit every note, but also to extract maximum gorgeousness from everything he did. An adept musician, Sumney played the piano and guitar and even created powerful beats by slapping his microphone with the palm of his hand and looping the rhythms over the music played by his immaculate band. Sumney noted between songs that, while he usually relies on backing tracks and pre-recorded instrumentals, Saturday’s performance was “all fucking live.” He worked hard to make sure the audience had a great time—in the middle of the set, for example, he walked offstage and down the aisle that cut through the crowd. For two full minutes, he held a girl’s hand as he sang—the jumbotron showed her mouthing, “I love you.” There’s something a little ridiculous about the corny spectacle of pop stardom, and, thankfully, Sumney approaches his job with a biting sense of humor. At one point, he mentioned he had collaborated with Sufjan Stevens and James Blake. As we started to cheer, he interjected, “I know, it’s like a wet dream for you people.” Even though he teased the audience, he was clearly very thankful for them. He earnestly expressed his appreciation, making his set a reciprocal experience: The love went both ways.
Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith
If you’re in search of aesthetic and intellectual titillation, you would have loved ambient electronic composer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s Pitchfork set. The Berklee-educated musician stood before a mass of knobs and wires as she focused intently on her ribcage-rattling synths and beats. Instead of working to engage the audience (she didn’t look at or speak to us once), she let the music speak for itself. Artists don’t always have to be performers—and, given Smith’s background, it makes sense why she singularly focuses on her craft. While the ambience is often hard to crack, like a particularly edgy exhibit at the MoMA PS1, the delicate beauty of Smith’s layered rhythms and melodies shines through on studio recordings, like her most recent album, “The Kid.” Unfortunately, however, the overdrive bass at her Pitchfork set drowned out all the subtleties that make her music worth listening to. Perhaps it would have been rewarding, but it was too much work to sift out the pretty parts from underneath the wub-wub-wub. Without obvious beauty or dynamics, her set was a 45-minute-long earache. The most dramatic part was when the stage bouncers escorted away an audience member selling cheap beer from his backpack, forcing festivalgoers to settle for the $6 Rosé cider. That said, more than enough people happily sipped on their overpriced millennial pink beverages, and surrendered themselves to the wub-wub-wub.
Raphael Saadiq
Despite Raphael Saadiq’s fancy music industry chops (not only did he play in Prince’s backing band, but he’s also worked as a producer for Solange, Erykah Badu, TLC, Mary J. Blige, and more) he has the humbleness of a twentysomething just breaking into the biz. (At one point, he brought out Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest, no big deal. But, seriously, he didn’t make a big deal out of it—and it was weirdly refreshing.) His Saturday performance radiated with youthful energy and freshness, despite the fact that he’s over 50 years old. Saadiq approaches his favorite music genres like an adoring superfan, lovingly recreating old school funk and R&B. He doesn’t seem too concerned with making something new. he mostly just wants to have a good time. “I’m about to funk y’all up,” he promised. And he delivered—it was impossible not to dance. Saadiq’s positive energy has no bounds. He even made a story about his brother dying of a heroin overdose uplifting. He performed a new song off his upcoming album, which will be named after his brother, exemplifying the heartwarming nature of his music: “I was going through some hard times / I kept on pushing / I made it through / And I came out brand new.” Who cares if it’s cheesy? You’ll be too busy smiling to realize.

Dev Hynes, the virtuosic British producer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist who records under the name Blood Orange, has time and time again proved himself as one of the most talented musicians on the planet. On top of writing and producing three LPs for Blood Orange across the past decade, he’s also produced for artists like FKA Twigs, Solange, and yes, even Carly Rae Jepsen. His effortlessly charismatic set on Saturday evening felt like a holy experience not only because it affirmed his ingenuity and musical prowess, but also because it offered an exciting and relatively rare glimpse into Hynes as a performer. “I’M IN A PLAYING SHOWS MOOD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS G,” Hynes tweeted only three months ago, and announced a series of tour dates shortly after—Pitchfork being second on the list. The music gods have been overly generous to us: When Hynes and his band graced the Green Stage with performances of songs spanning his entire catalog, the experience felt like a blessing from beginning to end.
Listening to the meticulously produced Blood Orange tracks through a pair of headphones is a staggering experience in and of itself. But Hynes’s magnetism, coupled with his imbuing each real-time rendition with sparkling, improvised details, made the live experience feel ephemeral and special. Such was the case for the group’s luminous rendition of “Augustine,” a gorgeous single from Blood Orange’s most recent record “Freetown Sound.” “Nontheta / We heard it all from you,” Hynes crooned repeatedly, each time, embellishing the hook with an effortlessly ad-libbed vocal run, gifting his audience with minute flourishes unfound in the studio recordings. Throughout it all, it was impossible not to surrender in dance to the song’s infectious beat—but perhaps even more than that, it was impossible not to succumb to the gravitational pull of Hynes’s voice and stunning use of wordplay, as he sang references to Confessions by St. Augustine of Hippo and the shooting of Trayvon Martin, all in the same breath.
Hynes, known by most as a high-profile producer, also proved himself just as capable a performer, bringing his catalog to life with high-energy performances backed by a spectacular, capable band. Particularly, although his performance of  “Chamakay”—a track from back in 2013—didn’t elicit crowd sing-alongs as readily as “Freetown Sound” pieces, he and his band exuded a rapturous energy that the crowd met with enthusiastic cheers. At one point, the stage was a glorious frenzy, with Hynes spinning around and dancing to the beats he’d devised himself, his backing vocalists engaging in complex counterpoint harmonies, and his saxophonist downstage delivering a series of soulful runs atop it all. While Hynes alone is a delight to watch, his live band boasts an impressive group of musicians whose collective energies only complimented Hynes’s charisma and kept the set invigorating and refreshing.
If performing songs from his existing catalog wasn’t exhilarating enough for his audience, Hynes made the set feel even more exciting by segueing into a series of brand new, unheard songs from his forthcoming full-length:  “Negro Swan,” out Aug. 24 via Domino Records. “I have a new album coming out,” he announced with the slightest hint of a smile, to which the audience thundered back in cheers, no doubt eager for new content since 2016’s “Freetown.” One unnamed song Hynes shared off the new record—perhaps the eponymous track—found himself brooding aloud to glittering synths. “No one wants to be the negro swan,” Hynes sighed, then pivoted. “But can you break sometimes?” Despite the audience being completely unfamiliar with the unreleased material, the performances were clear highlights, only deepening the already-great anticipation and excitement for Blood Orange’s imminent return.
As Hynes and his band closed with an adrenaline-charged performance of the pristine, danceable E.V.P from “Freetown,” it was difficult to believe the set was about to finish. It was approaching ten minutes earlier than the scheduled end-time, and when you’re in the middle of one of the festival’s best sets by far, it’s easy to feel a bit of remorse for the eight precious minutes of Blood-Orange-that-could-have-been. No matter, in the end—as Hynes’s voice pirouetted through one final chorus, all one could possibly feel was a sense of awe and gratitude for the experience he’d just gifted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a confusing time for partisan alignments in America. A handful of conservatives have renounced the Republican Party as it degrades into what former Republican Max Boot calls “a white-nationalist party with a conservative fringe.” Libertarians (including “neoliberals,” a label some have tried to reclaim) might similarly find themselves unmoored. The protectionist, militarist, fiscally catastrophic, and, yes, white-nationalist Republicans are no option. But the primary victories of candidates affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, most notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s upset, might rattle those considering the Democrats.
Indeed, as a Democrat-voting libertarian — a label I accept hesitatingly, given its baggage, but an accurate one for my pro-immigration, anti-police-violence, and regulation-skeptical views — I’ve watched DSA’s ascendance ambivalently.
On one hand, the candidates have dragged establishment figures left on issues like enfranchisement and drugs. Most encouragingly, Ocasio-Cortez helped elevate the “abolish ICE” slogan — referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement — from the left-wing fringe to a litmus test for 2020. One might think DSA presents libertarians an opportunity to write the next chapter of Ralph Nader’s book “Unstoppable,” a history of recent cross-ideological alliances to “dismantle the corporate state.”
On the other hand, DSA is, well, socialist — and, of course, its members promote policies that libertarians recognize as somewhere between ill-advised and disastrous.
During his presidential campaign, avowed democratic socialist Bernie Sanders espoused some libertarian-friendly views even beyond social issues, like opposing bank bailouts and corporate influence on policy-making, and dismissed the idea that “government should own the means of production.” But his national $15 minimum wage would probably significantly hurt employment, and, as Hillary Clinton noted, his notorious free-college plan would be deeply regressive. But Bernie is a neoliberal sellout by the standards of other DSA rhetoric: At a New York DSA rally, a banner called for abolishing both ICE (great) and profit (bad). Earlier this year, Los Angeles DSA banded with wealthy landowners to defeat Senate Bill 827, which would have liberalized the state’s zoning and tamed its skyrocketing rents.
But libertarians should eagerly accept these tradeoffs.
The gravest threats to liberty in America are deportation and mass incarceration. Immigration serves as an excellent litmus test for whether self-proclaimed libertarians actually believe in individual rights or merely seek the “right to be left alone for themselves and their tribe.” As Bryan Caplan (star of last week’s column) forcefully argues, migration is a fundamental human right, and its treatment as anything less should appall us. The injustices of imprisoning someone for a “crime” that violates nobody’s rights, whether selling marijuana or overstaying a visa — let alone separately imprisoning their child, a practice that continues — demand our immediate attention. ICE has been accused of a number of abuses — including retaliations against journalists and activists and the sexual assault of thousands of detainees. Meanwhile, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has announced a “denaturalization task force” focused on deporting American citizens. Libertarians must focus on abolishing ICE and decriminalizing migration now. Tax rates on the wealthiest earners can take a back seat.
Now, whether libertarians should vote for a DSA-backed candidate obviously depends on the particulars (see SB 827). But in national politics, left-wing Democrats, including those with the DSA label, represent the most viable option, electorally and politically, for addressing these urgent issues.
The electoral successes of DSA-backed candidates have already dwarfed those of the Libertarian Party: In addition to Sanders and the near-inevitably-elected Ocasio-Cortez, DSA affiliates have won a major-city district attorney election (to very libertarian-friendly results), a medium-city mayoralty, and various primaries and elections in state-congressional races.
Do other major-party factions offer better possibilities? No. The Republicans’ “anti-establishment” wing, the Freedom Caucus, have shown themselves either false libertarians or utter cowards in their deference to the administration’s statist drug and immigration policies. It’s hard to imagine DSA Democrats similarly falling in line behind Democratic leadership: Sanders, for one, openly called for a primary challenger to Barack Obama. Conversely, establishment Democrats might appeal to some economic policy-wonk libertarians or neoliberals as socially progressive technocrats. Yet they have failed to leverage their minority-party status as Republicans did under the Obama presidency, when Ted Cruz essentially single-handedly shut down the government over Obamacare, and have embraced civil-libertarian positions (like abolishing ICE) only under threat from their left.
Instead, libertarians should hope for a left-Democrat caucus strong enough to extract concessions (yet, ideally, too weak to determine the party’s economic agenda). Ocasio-Cortez has proposed such a caucus. Far-right Republicans followed this model to block immigration reform this year and in 2014, despite majority support in both chambers. (So much for the “Freedom” Caucus.) A small DSA bloc might use similar methods — perhaps threatening to shut down the government more credibly than center-left Democrats — to force the issue on DACA, family reunification, or even, say, future surveillance expansions. It could not launch a massive expansion of the regulatory state, let alone “abolish profit."
Even if DSA swings the economic platform leftward, “top neoliberal shill” Noah Smith has argued that Ocasio-Cortez’s proposals aren’t necessarily so awful (for consequentialists). And her “green new deal,” depending on its execution, might be reconcilable with libertarian principles: even Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick recognized pollution as infringing on others’ property rights.
Ultimately, though, the greatest upside to an alliance with the left lies in its anti-establishment streak. Candidates who, like Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez, refuse corporate and super PAC donations, are less beholden to the “iron triangles” — comprising government agencies, the contractors who extract inordinate profits or regulatory capture from them, and policymakers who rely on the latter’s donations and pass such pork-barrel funding — that drain public funds and ossify bad policies. And in direct-action anarchist brilliance, DSA activists heckled Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant — and, one day later, the administration announced an end to the family separation policy.
So, on that inspiring note, let’s suspend disagreement on marginal tax rates. Let’s bring together everyone who agrees that people who weaponize state power to enrich themselves or rip families apart should not blissfully carry on at Mexican restaurants. I’ll give it to Nader, that old libertarian-progressive rabble-rouser: That alliance does sound unstoppable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow spoke to lawmakers and Harvard affiliates on both sides of the political aisle during his first trip to Washington as Harvard’s president last week, pledging to champion higher education.
Bacow told students, alumni, and lawmakers assembled at the National Portrait Gallery Thursday evening about his plan to advocate for not just Harvard, “but for all of higher education.”
The two-hour event, hosted by the Institute of Politics’ Summer in Washington Program, drew a crowd of nearly 500 guests, many of whom were College students interning at public service organizations and political offices.
Addressing the crowd for the first time as University president, Bacow told attendees the values of colleges and universities have “enabled the American dream for so many of us” and that is it “important that we not let that dream die.”
Bacow also discussed the importance of public service and recounted how he had initially wanted to work in the Jimmy Carter administration after earning his master’s in public policy from the Kennedy School in 1976; he ended up taking a job at MIT instead.
“It is our responsibility to engage,” he said. “It’s our responsibility to work on behalf of others less fortunate.”
Bacow’s remarks come at a time when higher education is facing skepticism from Washington and from around the country. Like his predecessor Drew G. Faust, Bacow took the opportunity on his D.C. trip to connect with several lawmakers, including U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro (D-TX), U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), U.S. Senator Patrick Toomey ’84 (R-PA), and U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).
“After meeting President Bacow for the first time, I can see that he is an extremely captivating man, who is clearly very accomplished. I look forward to getting to know him and learning more about what he envisions for Harvard’s future,” Toomey said after meeting Bacow at the event. 
Van Hollen was among the group of six senators who sent Faust a letter in May, which called on her to increase opportunities for students across the University to work in public service summer internships.
Former Dunster House Resident Dean Carlos E. Diaz-Rosillo, the senior deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, also attended the event, which he said was a “great sign” of Bacow’s commitment to public service. Diaz-Rosillo departed Harvard in Jan. 2017 to work in the Trump administration, which he left in June.
“To have his first public event as president, to come to the nation’s capital to meet with alums and students who are doing great work in public service, I think it’s a great tribute to the importance of public service and to the emphasis that he’ll play as president,” Diaz-Rosillo said.
Bacow emphasized the importance of working across party lines during his remarks and told the crowd that he looked forward to working with them “in years to come.”
“We all have to work together: liberals, conservatives, Democrats, Republicans. It is our responsibility to make sure that we leave this country and this world a better place than we found it,” Bacow said. “It is an honor beyond words to be part of this journey together with each and every one of you.”
During his trip, Bacow also sat down privately with lawmakers across the political spectrum, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer ’71 (D-NY), U.S. Senator Mike D. Crapo (R-ID), and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA). He also met with U.S. Representatives Katherine M. Clark and Richard E. Neal, two members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, according to University spokesperson Paul Andrew.
After meeting with Bacow on Wednesday, Markey posted a photo on Twitter of the pair shaking hands.
“Always great to meet with new @Harvard President and my friend Larry Bacow to discuss how to expand access to education and increase federal investment in research to drive innovation and achievement,” Markey wrote.
In an interview Monday, Neal said his meeting with Bacow was “very productive” and that the two had discussed the university endowment tax his Republican colleagues passed last year, among other topics.
“He certainly expressed his views on the endowment tax and those are views that I share,” Neal said. “I said I thought the tax was punitive and he agreed with me.”
Lindsay Nothern, Crapo’s press secretary, said on Monday the senator’s meeting with Bacow was a “get to know you” affair, during which the two had a “good conversation on a number of topics.” Nothern added that there was “nothing specific” on the meeting’s agenda.
Clark wrote in a statement Monday that it was a “pleasure” to meet with Bacow.
“He is a living testament to the power of education and its ability to open doors and minds,” Clark wrote. “I am eager to see how his leadership and vision will invigorate Harvard, Cambridge, and higher education overall.”
Markey, Crapo, and Schumer co-signed the May letter to Faust regarding public service funding.
Kennedy School alumnus Joseph B. Tompkins, Jr.—Bacow’s former classmate who attended the National Portrait Gallery event— said he approved of Bacow’s intentions to do more “outreach” during his presidency, mentioning Bacow’s plans to visit his hometown in Michigan on behalf of Harvard.
“[It’s] good to reach out and not just worry about what’s going on in Cambridge,” Tompkins said.
Correction: July 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Carlos E. Diaz-Rosilo is the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. In fact, he is the senior deputy chairman of the NEH.
