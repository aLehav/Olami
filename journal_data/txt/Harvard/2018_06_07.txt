After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By any stretch of the imagination, Paul Schrader’s career has been unusual. The most notable film he wrote—and an extraordinary one at that—appeared in theaters 42 years ago, directed by a young Martin Scorsese (“Taxi Driver”). What has followed “Taxi Driver,” as we would expect from most artists, is littered with a healthy dosage of early artistic successes (“Raging Bull,” “Blue Collar”) and late unmitigated failures (“The Canyons,” “Dog Eat Dog”). Schrader may have summed it up best when he noted, “It doesn’t really matter what I do, the first line of my obituary will be ‘the writer of “Taxi Driver.”’”
It’s precisely this context that makes the vibrant energy of Schrader’s new film, “First Reformed,” deeply intriguing to unpack. Not only is the film an extraordinary piece of art in of itself, it implicitly offers a new lens with which to explore the artistic strengths and weaknesses of Shrader—that is, the evolution of a mind with the capability to produce great art.
Here, Ethan Hawke plays Reverend Toller, the chaplain to a small congregation in upstate New York. On the practical side, his church is a subsidiary of a larger religious organization marked by obligatory corporate sponsors. Its organ is broken; the church has been partially converted into a gift shop.
Amidst the dwindling churchgoers sits Mary (a wonderful Amanda Seyfried) and her vaguely religious husband Michael (an equally compelling Philip Ettinger). In a moment of slow burning crisis, they ask Reverend Toller to council Michael through his depression, driven by his concern for the natural world: What child, Michael asks, should be brought in to a world that is being destroyed by human hands?
What follows is a carefully wrought interrogation of the relationship between the church and the natural environment. “First Reformed” operates with the assumption that there is a theological rationale for the preservation of the earth—humans must act as the benevolent stewards of, as Toller terms it, God’s creation. Yet the most intriguing moments of “First Reformed” are when it examines what a human dedication to this premise looks like; what precisely happens when the individual becomes consumed by their conceptualization of the world—even if that understanding of reality is based in the agreeable foundation of environmentalism and faith.
Thus begins Toller’s descent into madness. Hawke works well in the role, suppressing Toller’s wide-eyed insanity until the film’s slightly overdone finale. This is not to say that the film’s conclusion or its exploration of madness does not work; rather, at risk of undermining some of the surprise in each of the film’s three acts, its conclusion is simultaneously intellectually engaging and narratively disconcerting.
Within this framework, perhaps one’s appreciation for the film is tethered to one’s artistic priorities: At certain points, “First Reformed” does not quite work as a story, but works very well as a series of interconnected and evocative ideas. At the risk of seeming dismissive of the needs of narrative, the film is layered with enough intellectual thought that many of its narrative flaws are simply easy points of criticism without holding much weight on the overall artistic product.
Much of that intellectual thought is borne out in its visual craftsmanship. The camera work is impeccable, creating a collage of interlaced images that links seemingly disparate ideas. Schrader is always careful to frame conversations around the isolated image of characters’ faces, lending a certain vibrant mobility to the movement of discussions.
Even something as simple as Toller’s home is given delicate representational thought. As the film unfolds, the camera slowly reveals the sheer expanse of Toller’s physical space, projecting the progressive emptiness that manifests once his perspective expands to the incomprehensible domain of cosmic proportions.
It is on the small, fundamental building blocks of filmmaking that “First Reformed” thrives. It is through their coherent assemblage that the film becomes an eloquent articulation of conceptual challenges. In a small bit role as a choir director, Victoria Hill deftly depicts the psychological trauma of unrequited love and the effects of Toller’s self-absorbed cosmic reflections. Cedric Antonio Kyles (Cedric the Entertainer), another supporting character, compellingly articulates the nuanced relationship between the church, faith, and wealth.
Nevertheless, this cannot obscure the fact that the ending of “First Reformed” is an outpouring of creative and narrative foolishness—albeit tension-addled narrative foolishness. Nor should that ending obfuscate the rich artistry of what preceded it. Perhaps what we have received here, then, is the articulation of a brilliant creative mind; perhaps it is too much to expect the consistency of brilliance (over the course of a movie, let alone a career) from our best and brightest. Schrader, with “First Reformed,” has firmly entrenched himself in that category.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The extreme patriarchy of Gilead continues to crumble the tenuous bonds between women in “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Sisterhood is nearly impossible in Gilead when so many of the sisters in question are treated more like cattle than people. So when a budding friendship between June (Elisabeth Moss) and Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) blooms in “First Blood,” it refreshes the show’s potentially stifling character dynamics and provides hope for those who want to see women regain power in one of the most effective ways: through solidarity.
June and Serena Joy’s friendship was inevitable—the two, as they discover through a particularly awkward brunch—led somewhat similar lives before Gilead. Though Serena Joy was an outspoken revolutionary with horrific views on reproduction and June grew up in a feminist household and attended protests, the two both have a love for words (Serena Joy wrote a book and June used to work as an editor) and lived in the same Boston area. “Does anyone remember the name of that place on Boylston?” June asks the table, attempting to save the conversation after Serena Joy’s tone-deaf request to the tongueless Ofglen. “...It was amazing. The food was great and they had something called ‘the liberated omelet with eclectic potatoes.’”
“Oh! That earthy-crunchy place,” Alma exclaims.
“Magnolia’s,” Serena Joy says, answering the question. “They had the most amazing banana nut pancakes. Who knows—maybe we were there at the same time. Serendipity.”
June chuckles. The resemblance between the two are undeniable and purposeful, a clever way for “The Handmaid’s Tale” to find both tension and comfort in the characters who can laugh—rather morbidly—about going to brunch in a past life. But the differences are even more stark, making their psuedo-friendship’s downfall inevitable too. The scene in which it breaks is perhaps even more intense, tragic, and fraught than when “The Handmaid’s Tale” resorts to theatrics to sell a point. This is in large part due to both Moss and Strahovski’s incredible capacity to convey complex, layered emotion. As Serena Joy shows June a nursery-in-the-making, June tries to use her elevated power as a pregnant handmaid and the two’s newfound bond to bargain for a visit with her forcibly-separated daughter, Hannah. “If I could see her, it would just make me feel so much better,” June whispers. There’s a perfect combination of genuinity and fakeness in Moss’s countenance, from the restrained tears to the slightly off-pitch voice. Though “The Handmaid’s Tale” is already a stellar show because of its robust writing, Moss’s performances truly continue to push the show to its fullest potential.
As does Strahovski’s, whose character consequently replies “That’s not possible” after a long pause. In those few seconds, Serena Joy shifts from empathetic to confused to betrayed to angry. It’s impressive work accomplished in such a short amount of time—so much is conveyed, even though not much is said.
The leading women of “The Handmaid’s Tale” are clearly talented actors, so it’s truly disappointing when other supporting actors’—namely Max Minghella, who plays Nick—shoddy acting fails to provide the same heightened stakes. As June angrily cries about Serena Joy’s actions, Nick dispassionately stands in the background. “I want to see my own daughter,” June spits. “We’ll find a way,” Nick recites. Because of the discord in acting, belief in the fiction is temporarily suspended, hurting the immersive quality of the show.
Regardless, “First Blood” is still one of Season Two’s better episodes, even if it rushes the changing dynamics between June and Serena Joy ever-so-slightly. It’s a bit of an emotional whirlwind to jump from pure resentment to potential camaraderie to bitter spite once again in the span of an hour, but Moss and Strahovski handle it beautifully. Besides, the weight of their falling out is temporarily sidetracked when Ofglen goes rogue and quietly sprints into the opening of a new handmaid training center, a lit grenade in hand. There’s no doubt that Serena Joy’s husband, Fred, won’t come out of the explosion unscathed, putting both Serena Joy and June alone in the same household. It’s the catalyst to the next few episodes, capitalizing on the potential for friendship “First Blood” implies, and presenting an opening for these women—so similar and so different—to take back power in the Waterford home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“After” opens similarly to “The Handmaid’s Tale” Season Two premiere, with another prolonged, overly-dramatic scene set to a tonally unfitting song. This time, the episode starts with the funeral for the handmaids lost in the last episode’s bombing. Iris Dement’s “My Life” plays rather maudlinly in the background. It’s difficult to feel true sympathy for the deaths of largely unnamed characters, especially when the scene is so blatantly trying to wring it out of us for a good three minutes.
It’s frustrating because “The Handmaid’s Tale” is better than such shallow tactics, and yet, “After” continuously falls into these traps of easy sentimentality. Take the new bad guy, for example: Commander Cushing (Greg Bryk), who is every bit as slimy, vexing, and power-hungry as he can be. It’s almost too easy to hate him, maybe because that’s exactly what he was designed for. Cushing is no more than a plot device, and he’s quickly disposed of by Serena Joy’s (Yvonne Strahovski) own clever tactics. Though the purpose is worthy—demonstrating the incredible power Serena Joy has as the temporary head of the household—his character’s execution, figuratively speaking, is too hasty and too transparently trivial for the real dramatic gravitas that Serena Joy’s character deserves. It’s satisfying to see the Waterford household (minus Commander Waterford himself) gaze victoriously from their elevated view in the home—the camera angle panning upwards to emphasize this very aspect—but there could have been and should have been a more developed struggle to get there.
The pacing is definitely off in this episode, and not just in Cushing’s storyline. “After” visits Moira (Samira Wiley) in Little America again, this time to delve into her own process of recovery. She hunts for mentions of her fiancée, Odette (Rebecca Rittenhouse), in a binder filled with photos of the dead, those who never made it out of Gilead. All throughout, the episode dips in and out of the past, revealing a mountain of previously unknown information about Moira’s past: Moira was a surrogate mother, Moira had a baby, Moira struggled with feeling unattached to her child, Moira met the love of her life. All of this is packed into a small subplot of a single episode, making the new information hardly convincing and a somewhat superficial attempt to complicate an already complicated character. The pacing hardly does service to Moira, who acts more as a vessel for the show’s drama fantasies than the wonderfully complex character she was before “After.”
“After” struggles. It’s definitely entertaining, especially considering the premise that the last few minutes set up: Serena Joy starts taking over her husband’s duties, and breaks the law to write, enlisting June as her editor in the process. But the ending can’t save the haphazard messes “After” tries to string together. A lot happens—too much, in fact, making the episode more chaotically disappointing than artful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust wrote to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt Monday to condemn a rule he proposed in April that would mandate publication of data used to craft scientific studies which help shape public policy.
The rule, dubbed “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science,” proposes that the EPA make all data used to support scientific studies that inform its regulations available to the public. In remarks he gave in April, Pruitt said the rule would usher in the end of “the era of secret science at EPA.”
Faust, however, wrote in her letter that the rule is “fundamentally flawed.” She wrote that this kind of mandatory disclosure would specifically inhibit medical research, which she noted relies heavily on medical records that must remain confidential.
“The proposed rule, with its prohibition against EPA reliance on any study where personally identifiable data cannot be made public, effectively disqualifies the best available science from use in the regulatory process,” Faust wrote.
Faust, who will step down from her post as Harvard’s president in less than a month, has spoken out  against a number of Trump administration policies in the final year of her presidency, including his attempt to roll back protections for DACA recipients—undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. by their parents as children. Faust’s successor, Lawrence S. Bacow, will likely pick up where she left off when he assumes his new role July 1.
In her letter to Pruitt, Faust pointed to Harvard’s 1993 “Six Cities” study, which demonstrated a strong correlation between air pollution and life expectancy and influenced subsequent air quality regulations. The study has drawn the epithet “secret science,” Faust wrote, from skeptics who suggest that—because the data that backs the study is not available to the public—the research cannot be trusted.
Faust argued against this idea, writing that the study’s findings have been independently verified. She also wrote that the Six Cities study, which relied in part on participant’s private health data, offers a perfect example of why the notion of total data disclosure is misguided.
“That commitment to confidentiality is necessary for contractual and legal reasons, to be sure, but also to assure potential research volunteers that Harvard will always protect their private health information,” Faust wrote. “If not, individuals may be dissuaded from participating in new studies, and the quality of future science would suffer.”
Faust’s letter comes shortly after the EPA recently extended the comment period on Pruitt’s suggested regulation to mid-August. It also comes on the heels of a separate letter the editors of several prestigious scientific journals—including Science and Nature—recently sent to Pruitt critiquing the proposal.
Faust wrote in her letter that science is meant to “improve ourselves, our lives, and our world” and cited the new rule as a detriment to that goal.
“I urge you to reject this proposed policy change and the long-term damage it will do to our health, our communities, and our nation,” she wrote to Pruitt.
