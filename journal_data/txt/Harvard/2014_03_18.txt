After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A good speech inspires. It stirs emotion. It is simple. And sometimes a good speech comes disguised as something else. When Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Square, visited Harvard Business School last week, his fireside chat with Karen G. Mills ’75, a past Administrator of the Small Business Administration, evoked emotions that only memorable speeches do.
After I left, I kept thinking about what Jack said. “You have to be in control of your own destiny,” he calmly stated. “Surround yourself with people who challenge your ideas” and “learn from serendipitous moments,” he insisted. As I was crossing the Charles River, these thoughts kept swirling in my head.
If I were not able to attend, I would appreciate if someone shared those remarks to the wider community. I want to share three things that stood out for me.
Every good speech consists of three parts. The first part is what I call the “The Appearance.” The speaker does not impress you first with his words, but with his appearance instead. President Bill Clinton, it is said, grabs everyone’s attention when he walks into a room.
What is his secret? He gives everyone his full, undivided attention. So did Jack. He made you feel he was there; his thoughts were collected. When a student threw him a curveball during the question and answer session, he stayed calm. He didn’t need to wear an expensive watch or a suit, instead preferring jeans, sweater, and simple shoes. He let his sincere interest shine through.
The second part is “The Story.” The speaker tells you his message, but he does not simply state what happened—he also tells you a story. Consider Martin Luther King’s effective messaging in his famous “I have a Dream” speech: “Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. … America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds.’
“And so, we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice,” he exclaimed. A good story evokes emotions, and makes you listen more closely.
During the course of the chat, Jack kept telling stories. He told one especially humorous anecdote about his young father who opened a pizza restaurant with his best friend. In order to preserve the sanctity of the business, Jack explained that the two made a rule that they would not date any of the waiting staff. Naturally, the first person they hired was to become Jack’s mother. His father, having broken the rule, gave up the business to his best friend.
Jack shares one way he stays creative. He leaves his house every day at 7 a.m., only arriving at the office at 8:30 a.m. He walks to work, taking different routes each time. He says that observing ordinary life helps him to see things he would otherwise not see. At the office, his mornings are entirely scheduled. But his afternoons he leaves open to wander around in order to leave room for unexpected meetings or encounters that would otherwise not happen.
But you wouldn’t clap yet, because telling a story and appearing attentive aren’t enough. That’s why every good speech has a third part, the part I call “The Value.” A good story told in the right way is powerful. It makes for great entertainment. But it can be so much more powerful if the content is strong.
Jack said he sees technology fundamentally as a tool that should be used to make things more convenient and faster for a large audience. He emphasized how important it is to stay in control of one’s own destiny. He strongly insisted on enforcing transparency across organizations. Any notes of any meeting within Square are shared with everyone to promote team culture.
Most importantly, he said that it is important to build or work on something that one wants to see in the world. In another story, he explained how following your passion will lead you to your niche. And if you have passion, you will attract others, he noted. “Show, don’t tell,” he said. And when he pitched Square, he gave venture capitalists 140 reasons for not investing, and only 10 for investing. There will always be venture capitalists who don’t like your idea. Pitch your idea authentically and honestly.
That is it. Three simple lessons. Give your full, undivided attention. Tell your lessons through stories. And add value. What probably stood out most was Jack’s insight on constantly meeting the unexpected. That’s the reason he walks to work and walks around the office after scheduled meetings—to allow for things to happen that would otherwise not. Stay creative, stay serendipitous.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you were to take a look at a stat sheet for this year’s Harvard men’s basketball team, the name Dee Giger would not immediately catch your eye. But Giger, who is one of the Crimson’s five graduating seniors, has contributed valuable time and effort toward the program’s groundbreaking league championships and NCAA Tournament bids over his four-year career.
For Giger, this year’s dance will be an opportunity for him to take his first minutes on the floor during March Madness.
Demetrius “Dee” Giger, a 6’6” guard who hails from Arden, N.C., came into Harvard as a high school superstar ready to make an impact on the team. His alma mater, Christ School, won the North Carolina Independent Schools Athletic Association championship in all three of Giger’s years on the team. The sharpshooting Giger also earned all-conference honors in each of his four seasons of high school basketball.
“Dee joined a group of amazing basketball players when he came to Christ School,” Giger’s high school coach David Gaines said. “What was great is that they really just cared about winning. Dee was one that didn’t care how many shots he got. He had games where he would score 17 or 18 points but the next one only six, but if the team won, that’s all that mattered.”
Arriving in Cambridge in 2009, Giger was placed in the Crimson lineup behind future NBA star Jeremy Lin ’10. Despite coming onto the team in Lin’s shadow, Giger made appearances in all 29 regular season games, though he did not make a start.
Giger averaged 12.1 minutes 4.5 points a game his freshman year. A clutch moment in his rookie campaign came against Yale in New Haven. With Lin fouling out with 1:15 left in regulation of a tight early conference game, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker put Giger on the floor.
The freshman guard did not disappoint, hitting a game-tying three pointer with 27 seconds remaining to help send the game into overtime. In the extra frame, the freshman drained two free throws in the closing seconds to seal an 82-79 Crimson victory over the Bulldogs.
In his debut year, Giger recorded most of his career-high stats and earned an Ivy League Rookie of the Week nod. The freshman set career bests for points (14), field goals made (6), three point field goals (4), and free throws made (5).
In his sophomore season, Giger appeared in less than half as many games (13) and averaged 2.6 minutes per game. In his third year, Giger appeared in just five games and averaged two minutes per game as Harvard earned its first NCAA Tournament berth since 1946.
“Dee was never going to be a primary ball handler,” Davis said. “He had a growth spurt between eighth and ninth grade where he grew about six inches, so it affected his ball handling skills. He was not built to be a point guard—he’s a big wing that can shoot over people, and that’s been his role.”
After taking a year off, Giger returned to Harvard basketball this season for his senior campaign. With 11 game appearances and a start on the year, Giger has increased his average minutes per game to 4.8. In the Crimson’s Nov. 15 game against Howard, Giger recorded a career-high three steals.
On Senior Night, Giger made his first career start and played five minutes against Cornell in a 72-47 blow out win that kept the Crimson in control of the Ivy League.
“We went into this game for senior day and senior night starting our seniors,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was nice to be able to play a lot of players, but when you start the game you have guys that get three, four, five minutes right away on the bench.”
For the Gigers, Harvard basketball has been a family affair. During the halftimes of the Crimson’s final two home games of the 2009-2010 season, Dee’s then-nine-year-old sister Amya, who had battled respiratory and immune disorders, led cheers with the Crimson cheerleading squad. That experience made Giger’s Senior Night start all the more meaningful as he took the court in front of family and friends.
“For Dee to get a start and for the family that’s here and his parents, I am very happy about that,” Amaker said. “We are able to have a nice moment. For all the seniors but also for Dee in particular.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took two games for the bats on the Harvard baseball team to warm up. But once they did, the Crimson came through when it mattered most.
Facing off against Michigan State (9-8) in Greenville, S.C., the Spartan pitching staff shut out Harvard (2-9) in the first two games of the series to capture 1-0 and 4-0 victories.
Despite dropping Saturday’s doubleheader, the Crimson would have the last word and came through in full force on Monday, scoring seven runs in two big innings to secure a win against its Big Ten opponent.
“We really showed how we can all come together in a situation that was kind of against us,” junior Brandon Kregel said. “I think that’s a huge testament to our confidence and how we can play together as a team, especially coming off the losses.”
HARVARD 7, MICHIGAN STATE 3
Despite temperatures in the upper-30s and rain that ended the game after eight innings, the Crimson battled to a 7-3 victory in the final contest of the series.
The Harvard bats came alive in the team’s biggest offensive showing of the season to date, as a three-run second inning and a four-run sixth propelled the Crimson to the win.
It was senior Kyle Larrow who delivered the knockout blow. With the bases loaded, no outs, and the game tied at three in the top of the sixth, Larrow smacked a triple to right field that plated all three baserunners. One batter later, Kregel brought Larrow home to put the Crimson up four.
“[Larrow’s hit] was huge,” Kregel said. “But it all started with [sophomore Mitch] Klug hitting a leadoff double that was really big kick starting that inning…. Kyle’s bases loaded triple really capitalized on that whole inning. I think that was really huge collectively.”
Harvard jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the second inning, as the Crimson loaded the bases with two outs and proceeded to score on a single, walk, and hit batsman. Patience was the key to the rally, as Michigan State starter Walter Borkovich issued four free passes in the frame.
The Spartans would battle back in the bottom of the fifth and scored three runs – just one of which was earned – off Crimson senior starter Sam Dodge to tie the game.
But Harvard responded with a heavy hand in the next half-inning, breaking the game open to seize a 7-3 lead. Junior Tanner Anderson entered in relief to secure the win by shutting down the Michigan State offense with three scoreless innings.
“We really took advantage of opportunities with runners in scoring position today,” Kregel said. “In the first two games, we left a lot of runners on base…. We had a lot of people come up in big situations [today], and I think that really helped us.”
MICHIGAN STATE 4, HARVARD 0
Offense was hard to come by for the Crimson in the rubber game of the Saturday doubleheader, as the Spartans jumped out to an early lead and cruised to a 4-0 win.
Harvard could never quite figure out Michigan State sophomore starter Justin Alleman, who tossed eight innings of four-hit ball. The Crimson loaded the bases with two outs in the top of the fourth, but the runners were stranded after Alleman forced a foul pop up.
That would prove to be the last scoring opportunity for Harvard, as the team recorded just one hit in the final five innings of play.
The Spartans got on the board in the first frame against freshman pitcher Nick Gruener. A double from cleanup hitter Ryan Krill plated two runs. Gruener would eventually settle in, at one point retiring 11 straight batters, but the freshman was replaced after allowing a two-run triple in the bottom of the sixth.
Michigan State finished with just six hits in the game, but they came at opportune times–the second through fifth spots in the lineup were responsible for all of the knocks.
MICHIGAN STATE 1, HARVARD 0
In a classic pitcher’s duel, all that separated the two squads in game one of the series was a single run.
The decisive inning came in the bottom of the fifth, when Michigan State senior Joel Fisher led off with a double against Crimson sophomore starter Sean Poppen. A bunt moved Fisher to third, and a sacrifice fly one batter later brought home what would prove to be the winning run.
Poppen finished with a clean line despite taking the loss, as he surrendered just four hits while striking out six—three of which came in the fourth inning. The sophomore has an earned run average of 2.00 and has completed six innings in each of his three starts.
An efficient pitching performance from the Spartans made it difficult for the Harvard bats to get going. Despite only striking out five times, baserunners were hard to come by for the Crimson as two Michigan State hurlers combined to allow just three hits.
For Harvard, the biggest scoring opportunity came in the top of the fourth. A Kregel double coupled with a fielder’s choice and an error loaded the bases with two outs, but Spartan junior pitcher Mick VanVossen induced a fly ball to right field that ended the threat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team notched its first-ever full Ivy League championship, earning a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1946. However, the biggest decision delivered to the Crimson on Selection Sunday may not have been the one made by the tournament committee.
On the very same day, Zena Edosomwan, a four-star recruit from Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles, made a selection of his own. The 6’9” power forward committed to the Crimson, becoming the most highly touted recruit to ever land in Cambridge.
Labeled the No. 76 prospect in the Class of 2013 by Scouts Inc., Edosomwan received offers from 40 different schools, including UCLA, Texas, and Cal. In the end, however, the forward was set on coming to Harvard.
“[Zena] had his mind made up very early that [his choice] would be Harvard,” said Greg Hilliard, Edosomwan’s former coach at Harvard-Westlake. “We assisted in any way we could to make that dream come true.”
The path to Cambridge for the California native was not exactly a clear one. In 2012, Edosomwan suffered a setback as his SAT scores fell a mere 30 points shy of the qualification standards set by the university for admission.
Nonetheless, instead of accepting an offer from another school, the forward decided to reclassify as a 2013 prospect and attend prep school for a year. Ultimately, he chose Northfield Mount Hermon in Western Massachusetts, where Crimson teammates Laurent Rivard, Matt Brown, and Evan Cummins all attended.
The move proved to work out in all facets. Edosomwan averaged 12.9 points and 10.7 rebounds per game for the Hoggers, carrying them to a national championship. And most importantly, the forward qualified for admission to Harvard.
Now in his first year with the Crimson, Edosomwan has primarily served as a role player. On a team dominated by upperclassmen, the forward has received just 5.7 minutes per game, averaging 2.9 points and 1.7 rebounds in 22 contests.
However, even in limited action, Edosomwan has shown flashes of what he is capable of. The forward has scored in double figures four times this season, including an 11-point, nine-rebound performance against Florida Atlantic in January.
“I think [Zena] is adjusting to what we are doing very well,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We have a fairly deep roster in terms of our post guys, so [there are not always] as many opportunities to play him as much. But he’s coming…. He is a strong kid, and he will have a really bright future.”
Edosomwan will certainly get his chance to shine in the coming years. The absence of senior forward Kyle Casey next season will provide an opportunity for playing time, and the ensuing departure of now-junior forwards Steve Moundou-Missi, Jonah Travis, and Kenyatta Smith the following year could launch Edosomwan into a primary role.
If he can come close to emulating his high school numbers, the Crimson should be in good shape. Edosomwan was named a McDonald’s All-American nominee twice, and he averaged 16.4 points and 11.5 rebounds per game in his senior at Harvard-Westlake.
But for now, as Harvard prepares for its third consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, Edosomwan is doing everything he can just to fit into the system.
“My role is to just be tough, be strong, be physical, [and] finish,” Edosomwan said. “The team is so talented this year and so deep that if I do my role, then I’m just helping build on that team success.”
Nonetheless, while Edosomwan will undoubtedly have a much larger effect in the future, he could still make an immediate contribution in his first go at the Big Dance.
Fifth-seeded Cincinnati, Harvard’s second round opponent, boasts the sixth best scoring defense in the country and is known for wearing down opponents. If fatigue or foul trouble becomes an issue for the Crimson’s forwards, Amaker could briefly turn to Edosomwan. He would likely be responsible for defending 6’9” forward Jermaine Lawrence, a freshman who offers the Bearcats a large presence inside.
If Edosomwan does receive minutes Thursday, it would mark his first real battle against a top-tier opponent. His closest such experience came against Colorado, where he received just five minutes of work.
Indeed, the freshman has been eagerly awaiting this kind of moment ever since choosing Harvard over several power conference teams two years ago.
“We would tease [Zena and say,] ‘Are you going to lose to those [kinds of teams] in the early rounds?’” said Hilliard about his coaching staff after Edosomwan made his decision. “And he said, ‘Absolutely not. We are going to build a team that will compete for the national championship.’”

The Harvard basketball team’s rise over the past few years has been slow and steady. An Ivy League co-championship in 2011. An NCAA Tournament berth in 2012. A tourney win in 2013.
But a player who has guided the Crimson along the way has taken a much more circuitous path. Co-captain Brandyn Curry has been a playmaker for Harvard, and a role player. He’s been a co-captain–twice–but the senior spent last season as little more than a distraction for the team, taking the year off after being implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
With Curry’s Crimson career now coming to a close, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker is hoping to end one of Harvard basketball’s most important and interesting journeys at a happy destination.
“It’s part of our story, and that’s why our story has been a pretty darn good one,” said Amaker of Curry’s withdrawal and return. “Great movies...have some twists and turns and dips, but that’s what makes them compelling, interesting, and inspiring. I think that’s what these stories have provided for a lot of folks. It’s been very inspiring.”
Curry first made his impact on the Crimson program by agreeing to come to Cambridge. His commitment, along with classmate Kyle Casey’s, helped Amaker put Harvard on the map, setting the stage for the recruitment of junior Wesley Saunders, sophomore Siyani Chambers, freshman Zena Edosomwan, and any Harvard recruits that follow.
As a sophomore, Curry started all 30 games and guided the Crimson to its first share of the Ivy League title in school history. The following year, he took the team to the NCAA Tournament, where it lost to Vanderbilt. The Charlotte resident was named an Academic All-Ivy both years.
But Curry’s path veered off course in the fall of 2012, as he and Casey took a voluntary leave of absence to protect their athletic eligibility after becoming the face of a cheating scandal centered around a take-home test in Government 1310.
Curry said he expected the success Harvard has had during his time here. As for taking a season off, that would have definitely surprised Freshman Brandyn.
After spending the year selling insurance back home, Curry returned to a different team than the one he left. Chambers had developed into the point guard. Saunders had become the scorer.
That left Curry to fill in the gaps. Normally, younger players find a way to fit in with the older guys. But Curry and Casey’s situation is unique, and they’ve accepted the consequences.
In the first game of the year, Curry started alongside Chambers, and they both played well. But an injury sidelined the senior for nearly two months, and when he came back, Amaker wanted him to come off the bench. Curry was fine with that.
“My role is very simple, clearly defined: Be the best on-ball defender and take open shots,” Curry said. “I used to be the primary playmaker–my job was to lead the league in assists–but now that’s not my role, that’s Siyani’s role.”
It seems that Curry’s most important job on this year’s team has been to accept a lesser one than he once had.
Still, he has stepped forward at big moments.
Playing at Princeton, Curry scored a season-high 17 points, including 12 in the second half, to snap Harvard’s 24-game losing streak at Jadwin Gymnasium. Curry grew up in New Jersey and had dozens of friends and family members in attendance that night.
There are not many stops left on Curry’s path now. It’s unclear how big of a role he will play in Thursday’s game against Cincinnati, or any contests that might come after that. But regardless of how his time at Harvard ends, Curry said he’s proud of what he has accomplished.
“We’ve done a lot to build this program,” Curry said. “All the records we’ve broke and the culture we’ve built here speak enough to that.”

The Harvard women’s basketball team may have reached the end of its regular season, but seniors Christine Clark, Missy Mullins, Jasmine Evans, and Elise Gordon won’t be hanging up their jerseys just yet.
After losing to Princeton and eventual league champion Penn on consecutive nights, the chances of Harvard making a postseason run seemed to evaporate. But on Selection Monday, following the release of the NCAA Tournament bracket, the Crimson became the first Ancient Eight squad to receive an at-large bid to play in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
Harvard (21-7, 11-3 Ivy) will face Iona College (26-5, 18-2 MAAC), a team it has not played for 20 years, on Thursday night at the Hynes Athletics Center in New Rochelle, N.Y. The trip marks the third consecutive season that the Crimson has advanced to the WNIT.
The Gaels shared the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference championship and received an automatic bid to the WNIT after failing to land a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Last year, Iona fell to Drexel in the first round of the WNIT—the eventual champions and the same team that eliminated the Crimson in the second round.
Iona’s offense is spearheaded by forward Joy Adams, whose 26 double-doubles are second-most in the country, and guard Damika Martinez, who averages 24.7 points per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Smart. Tough. Knowledgeable. A student of the game.
This is how freshman Matt Fraschilla’s high school basketball coach David Piehler described the point guard.
“The first word that comes to my mind is tough. Just toughness,” Piehler said. “He’s a very smart player. He knew where to be, what to do, whom to guard, whom to not guard.”
Few at Harvard may know his name, as Fraschilla has only seen action in seven games this season for a total of 17 minutes, with sophomore Siyani Chambers racking up most of the minutes in the point guard position.
“I know that he’s such a competitor that it kills him inside that he’s not out there playing,” said Fraschilla’s former high school co-captain Matt Wilson. “He understands that he’s got to wait his turn. I’ve talked to him about this, and he just can’t wait until he gets an opportunity…. It’s just about staying positive and really getting your work in in practice because that’s pretty much your game.”
Fraschilla had his best game of the season in his collegiate debut on November 12th against MIT when he had 6 points on 2-for-3 shooting. In just nine minutes, Fraschilla matched the number of points Chambers scored in 19 minutes against the Engineers.
The Dallas, Texas native also recorded two steals in the MIT contest. Aside from his shooting ability, Fraschilla’s quickness on the court gives him the potential to be a strong defensive presence.
“Technique and anticipation makes you quicker, and he did both of those,” Piehler said. “Defensively, I’d say he’s one of the best on-ball defenders I’ve ever coached as far as staying in front and not getting beat off the dribble.”
Though he’s the shortest member of the March Madness bound Crimson at just 5’11”, what Fraschilla lacks in height he makes up for in work ethic.
“I never thought that his lack of height was a deterrent at all,” Piehler said. “I thought it was probably a strength because some people overlooked him and maybe didn’t think as much of him because he was shorter. He more than made up for that in his tenacity and determination and hard work.”
Before joining fellow freshmen forwards Zena Edosomwan and Hunter Myers at Harvard, Fraschilla played for Highland Park High School in Dallas and was co-captain his senior year.
In his two seasons at the varsity level, his team finished 54-10. Though his coach recognized his skills as a player, he also noted the importance of Fraschilla’s character as a leader on the team and in the community.
“He’s a quality individual. He’s not just a good basketball player but he’s well rounded,” Piehler said. “I teach a special needs PE class and I’ve seen Matt work with special needs kids, and he volunteered as a Special Olympics coach for at least the last two years.”
With Chambers leading the team in minutes and assists, it is unlikely that Fraschilla will earn a starting spot during Chambers’ remaining two years as a member of the Crimson. But the freshman can still have an effect coming off the bench.
“[There are] those guys that don’t play very much, they are the guys that will make your team better, work hard in practice every day, [and] push the starters,” Piehler said. “I’m sure he played a big role in pushing the starters in practice, making them better, whether it be on the scout team, running the other team’s offense…. I know he did that well and every coach needs players like that.”
Though this will be the freshman’s first trip to the Big Dance, the Fraschilla family is quite familiar with Division I basketball. Matt’s father, Fran Fraschilla, coached for Manhattan College, St. John’s University, and New Mexico—the very school Harvard beat last season in the NCAA Tournament. Fran Fraschilla has also served as a basketball commentator for ESPN, and Matt’s older brother, James Fraschilla, is a junior guard for the Oklahoma Sooners.
“He’s definitely got [basketball] in his blood,” Piehler said.

Got a big date this week and lack sufficient funds to go to a good restaurant? Go to a school that closes dining halls during Spring Break despite the large number of students who stay on campus (who would do that?!?!)? Flyby’s got you covered. It’s Restaurant Week...or weeks… from March 12-21 and March 23-28—we wonder what March 22 did to get kicked out. Here are some places in the Boston and Cambridge areas where you can get quality food for a (relatively) low cost.
 N.B. I grew up in Boston and know a lot of these places. I only listed the ones that I have been to and can vouch for, but the full list of participating restaurants is at http://www.restaurantweekboston.com
Cambridge:
The Elephant Walk: $15 for a two course lunch is hard to beat. French and Cambodian food is even harder to beat.
Temple Bar: Really good quality pub food, just far enough from Harvard Square that the hipster scale only hits a 7/10. Also, their bread is ridiculously good.
Russell House Tavern: Same type of food as Temple Bar but slightly cheaper. There are also a ton of Harvard alumni who talk really loudly about their time in college, which is always hilarious.
Honorable Mentions: Grafton Street Pub and Henrietta’s Table
Boston:
5 Napkin Burger: Like an upscale Tasty Burger. That doesn’t quite do 5 Napkin justice, since it is an actual sit-down restaurant (and a very fun one at that), but burgers and milkshakes are their calling card. Like Tasty Burger, I think they get away with charging about $2 more than they should for any given burger, but people (including me) buy them for a reason
Atlantic Fish: Go for lunch (since it’s slightly cheaper), but this is the place to go if you swore you’d go to a seafood place since you moved to the East Coast.
Joe’s American Bar and Grill: Take somewhere like Russell House, transplant it from Harvard Square, kick out all the hipsters, throw in some big screen TVs, and knock a few dollars off of the prices. Voila, Joe’s American Bar and Grill.
There are 200+ restaurants participating in Restaurant Week(s), and I have not been to all of them (...yet). Definitely take advantage of the opportunity to try some non-HUDS fare, whether you take one of these recommendations or another from www.restaurantweekboston.com.
