After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard community’s various email lists were briefly set alight this past weekend with news that an undergraduate was kicked out of Market in the Square, a popular late night convenience store, for kissing his boyfriend in the store during the early hours of Sunday morning. The employee responsible reportedly told the couple: “We don’t want that shit in here.” After the student, Aaron C. Fallon ’11, circulated this news—first over the Queer Students and Allies list and then over many others after readers forwarded the message elsewhere—students across campus reacted with indignation.
Fortunately, the incident appears to have been resolved as well as it could have been. On Monday, April 4, Fallon met with Ahmed Eino, the manager of Market in the Square, to voice his complaints. After viewing the footage of the incident together, Eino spoke with the employee who was alleged to have expelled Fallon and his boyfriend. He rejected the man’s claim that Fallon had been trying to shoplift, and decided to fire him at the end of the week. In an interview with The Crimson later, Eino explained that the employee’s behavior was “unacceptable.” Luckily, this act of flagrant discrimination and homophobia was called out and justice served.
Looking at the recent histories of both Harvard and the United States, it seems unavoidable to conclude that our community remains beset by a palpable degree of intolerance surrounding LGBTQ issues. In fact, one of the greatest ironies that characterizes life at the country’s most established universities is the amount of homophobia that still exists on college campuses and the anxiety that it inevitably inspires. How can we forget, for instance, the case of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers freshman and victim of homophobic bullying, who committed suicide just this past fall?
With this in mind, and considering how many similar instances end unresolved or in tragedy, the undergraduate community’s championing of Aaron Fallon’s cause has been heartwarming. Too often, homophobic incidents go unreported or receive a lack of attention from the broader community. After the incident involving Lamont Library’s LGBT book collection and urine, QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 told The Crimson that more must be done to ensure such events are “comprehensively reported and commented on.” Clearly, Fallon has earned our praise for making his story known to the Harvard public and for actively seeking redress for what happened to him.
A large community stands best placed to offer support in such cases when someone makes a strong effort to initiate dialogue. Wang herself said afterward that she was “proud that Aaron spoke up and…impressed to see the response.” So are we. In the same vein, though, we should recognize the response of hundreds of Harvard students, both within QSA and across the campus, who read Fallon’s email and expressed their support. We should all offer our future support in demanding responses and clear explanations for incidents of discriminatory behavior.
After many homophobic incidents both at Harvard and other universities, and after a period of distinct tension regarding the return of ROTC to campus, it is a very positive development that our community has taken such a firm and clear stance on this event. We hope that this response signals the dawn of a more vocal and active age on campus in which students engage in debate but join in unison to voice a firm intolerance for intolerance itself.  Clearly, homophobia continues to present a serious challenge across the country—especially, it seems, for many people at school. One’s employee’s decision to expel a same-sex couple for kissing from his store shows that isolated incidents of homophobia—like other forms of discrimination—are hard to stamp out. But by working hard to create a climate in which all members of the Cambridge community are moved to express support for LGBTQ rights, we can reduce the frequency and impact of such shameful and embarrassing events.
All members of our community should feel comfortable, respected, and at home at Harvard: If this is to be the case, we must make sure to respond with the same solidarity and collective rejection of homophobia in the future that we have seen with this incident at Market in the Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi faces a major sex scandal and criminal charges stemming from his now-infamous “bunga bunga” parties, The Atlantic opened a feature on these parties by comparing Berlusconi’s position to that of former president Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998. The comparison, of course, was limited—Berlusconi has no equal when it comes to ego or controversy. It did, however, raise the question: If Italy’s leading political figure can likely survive a scandal featuring a then-underage, undocumented immigrant exotic dancer, could such a leader avoid the axe anywhere else in the world? Certainly not in the United States, Americans will say: Such outrageous behavior is unacceptable from our leaders in the post-Clinton era. Yet while we lack a Berlusconi, the United States might prove less different from Italy in our expectations for public leaders than we might hope.
It is unfathomable to imagine a U.S. president throwing sex parties at his private villas, in which dozens of girls would be brought in and paid to perform whatever duties are expected of the lurid “bung bunga.” As a nation, Italy has largely different laws and expectations about sex. Prostitution, confined in the United States to massage parlors and Craigslist, is legal in Italy; until recently, Italian prostitutes could work from the age of 16. Coincidentally, it was Berlusconi’s administration that raised that age to 18, creating his problems after alleged encounters with Karima el-Mahroug.
The sordid details of the allegations against Berlusconi are well documented. Less apparent, however, is how exactly the Italian people really sees this scandal. In February, thousands of women marched against their prime minister, rallying in support of improving Italy’s present values. Expatriate Italians have found themselves in the uncomfortable position of criticizing their home nation’s leader to the satisfaction of media in their current regions, for example the press in Doha, Qatar. Yet many experts have also pointed to Berlusconi’s continued support in Italy. Gavin Hewitt, Europe editor for the BBC, has noted that many in Italy continue to admire the earthily mannered magnate and football club owner. While his satisfaction ratings are down to 30 percent, Hewitt has contrasted Berlusconi’s pariah status among other world leaders with the real possibility of his preserving power domestically.
As to ‘Il Cavaliere’ himself, Berlusconi appears confident that his persona is simply too big to fail. In a conference with Italy’s regional presidents on the nation’s pressing immigration emergency, exacerbated by the rush of refugees from North Africa, Berlusconi quipped, “I’ve registered bunga bunga as a brand so that I can use it in all of Italy’s regions.” The prime minister also recently told a crowd on the island of Lampedusa, embattled as a close target for those seeking to flee Tunisia and now Libya, the results of a presumably fictitious poll: “According to a survey, when asked if they would like to have sex with me, 30 percent said, ‘Yes,’ while the other 70 percent replied, ‘What, again?’”
Such in-your-face flippancy about his situation would prove disastrous in American politics. Yet even in the years since Clinton’s scandal to close the twentieth century, our new century U.S. politics seem riddled with cases of some kind of sex scandal. Often, those politicians have seen their careers ended, from John Edwards to Nevada Republican John E. Ensign’s recent decision not to run for reelection to the U.S. Senate. A quick Google search will reveal many lists of political transgressors, usually posted by partisans of one party to highlight scandals within the other’s caucus.
Yet the glaring exception continues to be Newt Gingrich, the former House of Representatives speaker who spoke most vociferously against Clinton’s transgressions and in favor of the president’s impeachment. Gingrich, for those living under a rock, has of course become embroiled in his own sex scandal. Gingrich has been reaching out to prospective voters about restoring America’s moral foundation even as he disputes a well known story that he divorced his first wife in 1981 after springing his decision on her at her hospital bed as she battled cancer.
Whereas Berlusconi perhaps maintains some popularity because voters know how he would handle such allegations—with bravado and misogynist humor—Gingrich’s tactic has been to deny, deny, maybe spin a bit, then deny some more. In the New York Times politics and government blog “The Caucus,” Joseph Berger recently asked, “Is Newt Gingrich a hypocrite?” Given that Gingrich was having an affair as he crusaded against Clinton, voters considering his call for a restoration of values would have grounds to think so. Gingrich, however, disagreed on Fox News, admitted the situation was “complex,” and then disagreed a lot more. According to Gingrich, he never judged Clinton on his extramarital relations, just on lying about them.
Gingrich must, presumably, have some respect for Berlusconi when it comes to honesty about his views on women. Even entertaining the possibility of Gingrich as a future president of the United States, however, would be dishonest of our nation. Shake your head at Berlusconi, even the Italian political structure for allowing him to remain in power. If Gingrich gets much support in the polls, however, just remember that America’s hands are not much cleaner.

“If all the year were playing holidays, / To sport would be as tedious as to work.” Folks say these things, but really, who believes them? Now that the chill is nearly gone from the air and the workload is at last much lighter, my peers, at least, seem as if they’d be quite alright having these final few months extended—if not forever, then at least a bit longer. Thinking somewhat fantastically on how one might go about this, I turned to Adolfo Bioy Casares’ “The Invention of Morel”—that odd, slim 1940 volume Borges wrote “may be described, without exaggeration, as a perfect novel.” The premise is that a scientific genius invites his oblivious friends for a week-long vacation to a mysterious Polynesian island, where a machine records their actions; these actions are then frozen, so the machine can run them on loop after they die, reproducing reality again and again.
Clearly this is not the way to spend quality time with one’s loved ones—for one, you might condemn them eternally to scratching an ear every Wednesday. But fewer than 18 hours from now (if you’re reading this Friday morning) the U.S. government may come as close as it can to freezing itself in time—through what it refers to blithely as a “government shutdown.” If the House and Senate cannot compromise on the proposed budget cuts, then a number of federal offices will temporarily cease to operate, with the exception only of “essential services.” The National Park Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Internal Revenue Service, and various other organizations (some to be missed more than others) will simply suspend their activity. Zoo animals will still be fed, we are assured, but likely more out of the instinctive decency and blind ritual accompanying any threat, than from any too deep-seated sense of morality: the same way, perhaps, that one pulls on pants before fleeing a fire.
In these last few, crucial hours, Obama remains standing firm, calm king of his isolationist empire. The BBC reports that he has repeatedly reassured journalists he and Vice President Biden are “prepared to meet as long as possible to get the issues resolved.” Still, steadfastness only works if the other side isn’t equally mulish. Led by determined Tea Partiers and Speaker John Boehner, Republicans are demanding $61 billion in spending cuts—far more than Democrats are willing to grant. Such cuts are necessary to help the economy recover, the GOP insists. So too, they say, are the social policy riders conspicuously appended.
In fact, a government shutdown might not be the worst possible outcome. Compromise will be necessary, if not now then later—but if done too soon, it implies a sort of moral victory for the Tea Partiers that Obama and others are loath to admit. A shutdown would be expensive, and clearly less than ideal; what it would not be is anything new. Both Clinton and Regan, presiding over Houses of warring political convictions, saw their fair share—according to the Washington Post, six shutdowns occurred between 1977 and 1980; nine occurred between 1981 and 1996; and one particularly long one lasted from mid-December 1995 to early January 1996. Each time, the House managed to talk its way out of the deadlock—this is not the world of the genius Morel, and it does not exist in limbo forever. The shutdown has thus become almost a part of the political process, a kind of necessary hibernation—if not a holiday from work, then a rejuvenation of purpose. Government workers have spoken of experiences with previous shutdowns as humbling, reminding them of how inessential many of their jobs really are. If a shutdown does happen, one of the few elements inspiring any real pathos will be the thousands of unread visa applications molting in a back office, to which only Obama will now have the key.
When an island barricades itself off, it not only keeps others out; it also locks itself in. In a London Review of Books piece this week, David Runciman writes on the ways the offshore tax havens of island nations—most of them ex-British colonies—allowed Qaddafi to stow away his massive fortune so effectively. (Speaking on Kashmir in a visit to Pakistan this week, David Cameron confronted his nation’s own past with admirable honesty: “I don’t want to try to insert Britain in some leading role where, as with so many of the world’s problems, we are responsible for the issue in the first place.”) Even given the bungling of NATO airstrikes, it appears Qaddafi’s luck has definitively turned for the worse. “Crousseau on a raft sought Johnjack’s rational island,” punned Anthony Burgess’ poet in “Endberry Outside,” rather too pleased with himself—somehow the line evokes, for me, the dictator’s mad, isolated, misguided reasoning, which for so long met with no serious challenge. But there he sits now—locked in his Tripoli bunker, hardly on holiday, not a beautiful woman or almond dessert in sight. An island of his own, what more can he do now than relive these past decades, and their endless variations on the same mistake?

On Tuesday, Paul Ryan, the chair of the House Budget Committee, released a 2012 Republican budget proposal that eviscerates America’s safety net and support structure for the elderly, poor, and disabled to finance massive corporate subsidies and tax cuts for the wealthy. Ryan’s budget would restructure the government as we know it, and is the most honest reflection of the Republican vision for America’s future: a country where the most disadvantaged are given little help or support, while the wealthiest laugh all the way to the bank.
Ryan’s budget claims savings of $6 trillion over the next decade. Many of these savings are unspecified or based on faulty assumptions, but if we did assume reasonable claims, it’s important to keep in mind that the cuts finance enormous giveaways to wealthy Americans. The budget not only wants to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, which has been estimated to cost $4 trillion over the next 10 years, but it would cut top tax rates to 25 percent—10 percent lower than they currently are. The inhumane cuts in the safety net and sensible government programs will go towards funding welfare for the wealthy.
The major cuts in Ryan’s budget come to Medicare and Medicaid. The plan will end Medicare as we know it, replacing government health insurance for the elderly with vouchers to buy private healthcare insurance. Forcing seniors onto a private health insurance market will definitely make it expensive for the sick elderly to buy health insurance and difficult for them to receive decent healthcare. Instead of trying to reform the healthcare delivery system to reduce Medicare’s expenses as the Affordable Care Act does, this bill would cut costs by forcing seniors to try to buy expensive private healthcare insurance.
Medicaid will see even more draconian cuts. Medicaid, which provides basic healthcare services for poor, disabled, and elderly, is one of the most crucial programs for the most disadvantaged Americans. Ryan’s budget would repeal the expansion of Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act, the component of the healthcare reform bill that finally brought about universal healthcare coverage by guaranteeing healthcare for many poor and middle-income Americans.
In addition, Ryan converts Medicaid into block grants to states, which he argues would save $771 billion and give states more flexibility to implement Medicaid, language that masks the fact that this would be an enormous cut in a program that currently efficiently finances long-term care for the disabled and takes care of poor kids when they get sick. Block grants end the federal guarantee to increase funding for Medicaid during difficult times, or to account for significant healthcare cost growth. To quote the Congressional Budget Office, “The large projected reduction in payments would probably require states to decrease payments to Medicaid providers, reduce eligibility for Medicaid, provide less extensive coverage to beneficiaries, or pay more themselves than would be the case under current law.”
Food stamps would also be converted into block grants, which will also end federal funding during challenging times and which will cut funding from an already unfunded program that is the only safety net for the hungry. Funding for Pell Grants and cheap housing will be dramatically curtailed. Other radical unspecified cuts to mandatory and discretionary spending programs will unavoidably fall on programs such as Head Start and TANF that provide essential education and assistance to the poor.
Ryan’s budget relies on some absurd economic assumptions. It claims the enormous tax cuts for the wealthy will stimulate massive growth, which didn’t happen in 2001, and the CBO has concluded that it will take decades for this bill to reduce the deficit and it will actually increase it within a decade. There are sensible ideas that can fairly reduce the deficit in a few years, including restoring Clinton-era tax rates, implementing a carbon tax, and further reforming the health-care delivery system, but Ryan’s budget unfairly reshapes government for uncertain long-term savings.
The Republican budget employs bad economics, but perhaps most importantly, it is morally reprehensible. Two-thirds of the budget cuts are taken from programs that help the poor. Without Medicare, poor and middle-class elderly citizens will be left helpless and alone if they can’t afford healthcare after leaving the workforce. Without Medicaid and SNAP, the poor and their children would be mired in a grinding poverty trap, without the healthcare or food necessary to live a decent life. To top it off, the cuts in all of these programs will go to fund extremely low tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. The House Republicans are forcing us to ask ourselves whether we are a country that cares for our least-fortunate citizens, because they certainly do not.

Building up the skills for success in business is like getting married, according to serial entrepreneur George B. Bennett. “If you don’t date, it’s hard,” he said with a laugh.
Bennett, who has founded many companies—including consulting firm Bain & Company—integrated amusing anecdotes and creative analogies into leadership recommendations for the students gathered in Kirkland JCR last night.
Bennett shared what he considered to be the most important principles in business, adding that many of them have remained constant over time, applying to both his childhood lemonade stands as well as his current multimillion dollar entrepreneurship initiatives.
He emphasized the importance of respect and dignity in interpersonal relationships and the value of a good mentor.
“Assume everything you think or say will be seen by or read by people you wish the least to read it,” he said.
Bennett also stressed the ability to adapt in the business environment.
“Most of us evolve and change,” he said. “I go with the best idea now. I’m very pleased I am not running for President of the U.S. I am allowed to change my mind.”
Bennett addressed many student concerns regarding the nature of business, including the supposed trade-off between success in business and in community life.
“The idea that you can’t do both is just not accurate,” said Bennett, who said he stayed extremely active in community work—even managing a Cub Scout den—while pursuing his business endeavors. “Commitment to community is not a distraction. It’s necessary to sustain a level of intensity in life, which helps you to have a career and start a company.”
Ultimately, Bennett assured students that ability and integrity would lead to payoffs if handled correctly.
“It’s like trying to get hit by lightning. You can stand still or stand on top of a mountain with a metal rod,” Bennett said. “Having a good idea is only the first step.”
Gabriel T. Lloyd ’13, the main organizer of the event, said he felt that Bennett’s motivational skills and leadership experience spoke well to the spectrum of Harvard students’ interests.
“He is a strong entrepreneurial leader and has had a successful career in many different sectors,” Lloyd said.
Attendee Reid C. McCann ’13 praised Bennett for his strong track record.
“One of the greatest things about him is that he’s able to take an idea from scratch and turn it into a big-time organization,” he said. “He knows how to transmit ideas into action.”

As part of University President Drew G. Faust’s effort to promote the arts, the University announced April 4 that renowned Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis will deliver six lectures over the next two years at Harvard.
Marsalis will also work with students and performance groups on campus during that period.
“Wynton Marsalis is both an internationally acclaimed musician and a leader in educating people about the importance of arts and culture,” Faust said in a press release. “We are fortunate to have an artist and performer of his caliber on campus to enhance the University’s vibrant arts scene and engage our students, staff and faculty.”
Marsalis is the current Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center and is an esteemed figure in America’s music and cultural history with a body of work spanning over 70 albums. His accolades include nine Grammy awards and an Honorary Membership in Britain’s Royal Academy of Music. He is also the first jazz musician to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Music.
“I am delighted that Harvard has recognized the need to make cultural literacy an integral part of its curriculum,” Marsalis said in a press release.
Marsalis’ appointment is part of the University’s initiative to further integrate music and art into campus life. Previously, a number of prominent artists have been brought to campus as part of programs like the Office for the Arts’ “Learning from Performers” series.
Marsalis’ appointment coincides with the celebration of Harvard’s jazz history and broader musical culture this month, including the Office of the Arts’ program “40 Years of Jazz at Harvard: A Celebration.”
Ingrid Monson, the Quincy Jones Professor of African-American Music, described Marsalis’ appointment, writing, “It not only recognizes the centrality of jazz in American music, but provides an opportunity for one of its foremost artists to interact with the Harvard student body in a substantial and ongoing way.”
“What an excellent way for Harvard to show its commitment to bringing the arts and the intellectual life of the university together,” she wrote in an email.
On April 28, Marsalis will offer a lecture and a performance titled “Music as Metaphor” at Sanders Theatre. Marsalis will also be teaching a master class to student musicians at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School the next day.
Tickets to the event are free. Early tickets will be available to the Harvard community on April 12 through the Harvard Box Office, and tickets will be available to the general public on April 14.

When Stuart Cary Welch ’50—who served as a curator of Islamic and Indian art at the Harvard Art Museum until 1987—died in 2008, he left behind an extensive private collection of Persian and Indian paintings and drawings.
On Wednesday, part of that collection sold at a Sotheby’s London auction for about £21 million—over four times the estimated sale price.
Welch amassed his large collection of Islamic and Indian art at a time when there was limited demand for art from these cultures.
“He looked very closely at art historical traditions and fields that many people in America weren’t paying attention to at that time. As a result of all that close study and looking, he was able to acquire works of art that in many ways, many people didn’t consider to be important,” said Thomas W. Lentz, director of the Harvard Art Museum.
The collection, titled “The Stuart Cary Welch Collection: Part 1. Arts of the Islamic World,” was originally estimated to sell for £3.5 to 5.3 million for 164 lots. After Wednesday’s auction, 154 lots sold for about £21 million.
Sotheby’s estimated that Wednesday’s sale was worth 34 million in U.S. dollars.
The auction also broke a Sotheby’s London record for Islamic art, after a folio from “Shahnameh”—an illustrated page from a 16th century manuscript—sold for £7.4 million to an anonymous bidder.
“The sale of the Shahnameh leaf today represented a rare opportunity for institutional and private collectors of Islamic Art who competed from across the globe to acquire this unique work of extraordinary quality and beauty,” said Edward Gibbs, senior director of Sotheby’s Middle East Department in a press release.
The work depicts Faridun, a king from a Persian epic, in the guise of a dragon testing his sons. It is made from “ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper,” according to the Sotheby’s website.
Lentz—who was taught by Welch while studying as a graduate student at Harvard—said that the “Shahnameh” is the Persian National epic, which was originally written in the beginning of the 11th century, and reproduced and illustrated for centuries in Persian art.
“This particular version [of the manuscript] is considered the grandest and most luxurious. The manuscript originally had over 250 separate illustrations that have now been broken up and separated into many different public and private collections, and this particular painting was one of the best in there.”
Welch was a longtime lecturer in Harvard’s History of Art and Architecture department. Lentz remembered him as a man who was a very passionate and engaged teacher and collector.
“The art museums at Harvard have an incredibly strong Persian and Indian painting and drawing collection, and much of that was shaped by Cary Welch. If you’re interested in this type of art, Harvard has a great collection here,” Lentz said.

Four professors offered their personal insight on how to succeed in academia at a panel entitled “Diversity in Higher Education:
Academic Career Pathways” hosted by the Office of Career Services and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences last night.
At a time when 44 percent of incoming Harvard freshmen are of color and 20 percent are international, Assistant Dean for Diversity Relations and Communications Robert P. Mitchell, who organized the event, said he specifically wanted to invite four professionals of color to share the various pathways they took to academia.
Throughout the event, the panelists touched on the obstacles they faced and overcame. Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds specifically described her prior experience as an African-American woman working in the male-dominated field of Electrical Engineering and Physics.
After battling with isolation as a student, Hammonds said she realized that she could build a support network by staying dedicated to her work.
“What matters is the engagement with the production of new knowledge,” she said. “We may not share ancestry, sexuality, class, or race, but what makes it possible for us to sit around the seminar room and feel like a community of scholars is that we’ve made a commitment to this production.”
Hammonds also emphasized the necessity of mentorship. She recounted an experience in which an advisor handed her six pages of dissertation comments. While the letter consisted of constructive criticism, it also ended with “You can do this,” she said.
“I learned that you have to have mentors. These are the people who will tell you the absolute truth,” she said.
Coming from various backgrounds, the other panelists also offered their own distinct advice. MIT Assistant Professor of Music Michael S. Cuthbert ’06 focused on taking initiative, encouraging students to build relationships with their peers and faculty.
“Get people to understand you, and let people know who you really are so they can tailor their advice to you,” he told the audience.
Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Sheila M. Thomas and Clinical Assistant Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures at New York University Maria de Lourdes Dávila ’89 pointed out that career plans often deviate and learning to work through failure is key.
While Thomas said she had to dismiss pressures to enter medical school in pursuit of her passion for research, Dávila said she spent ten years simultaneously writing her literature dissertation and dancing in New York.
Researcher and soon-to-be Harvard graduate student Shirley C. Sun, who attended the panel, said she found the speakers informative and inspiring.
“I learned that you don’t have be so self-conscious of your differences in the academy just because you’re underrepresented. Think about your contribution. In the end that’s how you join the club,” she said.

“Three, two, one, GO!”
Katie G. Walsh ’14 ran into the Annenberg, grabbing various ingredients like rice, green beans, and pasta sauce. Meanwhile, her teammate Viroopa Volla ’14 set up the cooking station.
Walsh and Volla, along with 11 other freshman teams, were competitors in Top Chef Annenberg last night. The teams had 30 minutes to cook an entrée and a dessert using only the ingredients in the dining hall.
“Twenty five minutes!”
Walsh and Volla share a passion for cooking. Walsh, whose grandfather owns a Lebanese restaurant, decided to make yakhni, an ethnic dish that involves rice and creamed vegetables in tomato sauce with cinnamon. For dessert, Volla decided to try her hand at a peach apple cobbler.
“Fifteen minutes!”
As the competition hit the half way mark, Volla cored the apple with a butter knife. Deconstructing the peach pie from the dining hall, Volla stuffed the peach filling into the apple and topped it with granola, cinnamon, and whipped cream.
“Ten minutes!”
While making yakhni, Walsh realized there was one key ingredient missing in the dining hall: ground beef. Walsh had to improvise by ordering a hamburger patty from the grill, which she minced with butter knife.
“Five minutes!”
Each team prepared one plate of food for the judges, to be evaluated on presentation, taste, creativity and sustainability.
Math Professor Benedict H. Gross ’71, former dean of Harvard College and a guest judge, said he will look for food that not only tastes good, but is also healthy and has a combination of flavors.
“I’m not a foodie, but I like to eat,” he said, adding that he frequently watches the TV show “Top Chef.”
Another judge, Jonas V. Clark, the dean of Oak Yard, said it was fun seeing what students can do with Annenberg ingredients.
“Creativity is what I am looking for the most,” he said.
“One minute remaining!”
As the time ticked down, the competitors placed the finishing touches on their dishes.
Walsh scooped a spoonful of pasta sauce and cinnamon into her mouth. “Mmhm, tastes like home!” she said.
“Time!”
Familiar ingredients in the dining hall were transformed into unrecognizable culinary masterpieces, such as the deconstructed peach cobbler, rosemary chicken with wilted spinach, and a caramelized apple, granola, and cream cheese wrap, which were presented to the judges.
“I get first dibs on dessert!” Clark said, eyeing the apple peach cobbler on the table.
The winners of the Annenberg competition, who will be announced this afternoon, will go on to compete with the winners of the House Top Chef competitions for the title of Top Chef Harvard on April 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As administrators from the College evaluate the equipment in the House gyms, several House Masters say that the closure of House gyms is on the table because of the expense of maintenance—though no decision has yet been reached.
Closing the House Gyms is “a question we’re all facing because gym equipment is very expensive. It takes maintenance,” Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said.
Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe said that some Houses had discussed closing their gyms earlier this year.
Despite the expenses, many House Masters said they are opposed to closing the House gyms.
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke said that the number of swipes into the Quincy House Gym every day shows it is a popular place to work out. O’Keefe shared this sentiment, adding that there were no plans to close Eliot House Gym.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 are working together to evaluate each gym, Nelson wrote in an email.
“We have had an ongoing discussion about how best to manage our House gyms and to make sure that equipment is properly maintained,” she wrote. The two are currently looking at the type, age, and maintenance of the gym equipment in each House.
Knowledgeable individuals within Kirkland and Winthrop Houses, however, said they have heard discussions about the closure of the House gyms.
An individual within Kirkland House said that the administration will probably end up taking the free weights­—all dumbbells and barbells—out of the House gyms.
Another individual in Kirkland House said that there was an effort to get rid of Kirkland’s gym a while ago.“I think they were explicitly told to do so, and they didn’t,” the person continued.
One potential liability issue with House gyms is that public gyms are supposed to have a CPR-trained monitor whenever they are open, according to the Winthrop House affiliate. But Harvard has considered these gyms to be private, similar to the gyms within an apartment building, which do not have to adhere to the same regulations, the individual said.
In 2003, each House received a one-time grant of $20,000 to renovate its House gym because of the long-delayed renovation of the Malkin Athletic Center. The overhaul of the MAC was completed at the end of 2007.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—The permissibility of evidence from a drug robbery of Yale students remains undecided in the trial against Jabrai Jordan Copney—the alleged gunman in the May 2009 shooting of Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in Kirkland House.
In a hearing after the trial adjourned yesterday, the prosecution called to the stand two key players who would help establish Copney’s alleged “intent” on May 18, 2009, and asked for their testimonies to be permitted in the trial.
In late 2008, Copney—along with Blayn Jiggetts, who the defense said  shot Cosby—allegedly robbed two Yale students at gunpoint during a marijuana purchase in New York City.
Assistant District Attorney David M. Solet, said that these testimonies would demonstrate that both drug robberies were conducted in a similar manner—in stairwells with the same type of gun.
Meanwhile, Copney’s attorney John A. Amabile said that the robbery of the Yale students was merely one “unproven, uncharged, unreported accusation” and was insufficient to establish a “pattern” of behavior relevant to the context of the case. Therefore, he said, it should not be admissible.
In the hearing, Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 called to the stand one of the Yale students whom Copney allegedly robbed in 2008.
Under oath, Jules E. Bolton, a 2009 Yale graduate, testified that he had made an agreement with Copney during Harvard-Yale weekend and intended to meet Copney at Grand Central Station in New York to complete the purchase later in the week.
But after arriving later than the scheduled time, Bolton said that Copney told him he left part of the money at his home and brought Bolton to his apartment.
There, Bolton encountered an individual known as “Fat Boy,” who Bennett clarified was Jiggetts, and the two robbed Bolton of his Yale ID and three pounds of marijuana at gunpoint.
Amabile cross-examined Bolton, who admitted that he made $40,000 by selling marijuana in 2007 and 2008 and did not file taxes for this income.
The second key player who briefly testified at the hearing was Chanequa Campbell—a former Harvard student and friend of Copney who has not been charged in the case.
The prosecution hoped to use as evidence in the trial Campbell’s testimony of multiple conversations she had with Copney about the general nature of drug robberies.
Campbell said that she recalled Copney saying that “there’s usually a finite end game ... usually someone ends up dead or in jail.”
But Campbell was not able to give a time frame for when the most recent conversation of that nature took place before May 18, 2009—one of the reasons why that testimony should not be admitted, Amabile said.
Campbell is scheduled to testify in front of the jury today. Before the trial reconvenes, Campbell will be instructed to provide a sanitized version of her statement to avoid hearsay.
Earlier yesterday, the jury left the Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn to visit Cambridge, where they viewed the Kirkland Annex, Dunster Street, and the route to Lowell House at Harvard.
The jurors were shown the room in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway where Cosby was allegedly shot.While approaching the gate to the Kirkland Annex, one juror reported that he spotted the` headline of yesterday’s Crimson, “Defense Says Jiggetts Pulled Trigger” in a newsrack located by the gate.
Jurors are not generally permitted to be exposed to information about the caseoutside of what is presented in the courtroom.
Prior to reconvening the trial yesterday, both the prosecution and defense discussed the matter with the judge and juror, resolving to disregard the incident, although the juror’s statement will remain in the case file.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Soon after Lynn K. Trever—a member of the dining staff at Harvard’s Greenhouse Café—first came to the U.S., she found herself toiling for 16 hours a day while eight months pregnant.
A native of Cambodia, Trever began working at the age of eight and says she often regretted not being able to obtain a better education in her youth.
But despite her exhausting work schedule and her lack of formal schooling, Trever decided she wanted to become an American citizen.
She recounted her tough path to citizenship in an inspirational speech at the Kennedy School last Tuesday, as she and 17 other Harvard employees were honored for passing their citizenship exams with help from Harvard undergraduate tutors.
These employees participated in the Citizenship Tutoring Program, which matches employees preparing for the citizenship test with volunteer student tutors. The free program is run collaboratively by the Institute of Politics and the Harvard Bridge to Learning and Literacy Program.
To Trever, who thanked the program repeatedly throughout her speech, Citizenship Tutoring made all the difference in allowing her to become a naturalized citizen.
A HELPING HAND
In the summer of 2002, the Bridge Program first began to tutor University employees who were hoping to obtain citizenship. In the fall of the following year, Russell M. Weinstein ’07 founded the Citizenship Tutoring Program in order to connect undergraduate students with employees preparing for the exam.
In its inaugural fall, the program started slow, drawing only about five volunteers. But in subsequent years, participation rapidly rose to include more than two dozen students.
One of the program’s key strengths lies in the fact that some of its staff are naturalized immigrants themselves.
Two of the Bridge Program’s liaisons to the undergraduate tutors—Tamara S. Suttle, the program coordinator, and Ana Roche-Freeman, an ESL instructor—immigrated from Barbados and Ireland and became citizens in 1998 and 2008, respectively.
Suttle and Roche-Freeman not only work with the undergraduate tutors during the year, but also perform tutoring duties during the summer.
They have a unique perspective on the apprehensions and fears that immigrants may face while taking the test.
“There are some questions that, if you don’t know English very well, are difficult to understand,” Roche-Freeman says.
The two have seen how the naturalization process has changed, even over the past few years.
In October of 2008, the test format was altered to include a more extensive civics section in which the examiner can choose any 10 questions from a list of 100 that the test-taker must study ahead of time.
In addition, Suttle and Roche-Freeman say that they understand how the rising cost of the test raises the stakes for prospective citizens.
While Suttle says she paid less than $100 to apply, the cost today is $680.
FORGING FRIENDSHIPS
The student program chair for Citizenship Tutoring, Julia B. Konrad ’13, emphasizes that the program offers volunteers a unique opportunity to build relationships with Harvard employees.
She says she realized just how connected she was to these workers during her first tutoring experience. Her “tutee,” Jose, realized when they first met that he had seen her name on her door earlier that day when cleaning bathrooms.
“The bond you make with your tutee is unique—these are people you see all around the campus,” she said.
Jacob J. Hutt ’13, a volunteer who joined the program as a freshman, also says he finds these bonds to be extremely meaningful.
Last spring, Hutt began working with Manuel Mendes, a native of the Cape Verde Islands and a custodian in Paine Hall.
Hutt tutored Mendes intensively for the two months before his scheduled test date.
“My experience with Manuel was different than most because we had so little time,” Hutt says.
Like many other participants in the program, Mendes had to overcome a language barrier, made additionally difficult by the fact that English is his third language—he is a native speaker of Portuguese and also speaks some French.
Yet Mendes’ grasp of the English language was strong enough that he ultimately focused his preparation less on the speaking and writing portion of the test.
“Because he had English speaking and comprehension ability, the thing we needed to spend most of our time on was the history and civics portion,” Hutt says.
The time crunch and long hours of preparation allowed Mendes and Hutt to bond.
Hutt skipped class to accompany Mendes to the John F. Kennedy Federal Building to take the citizenship exam.
Hutt provided much-needed comfort to Mendes, who says he was “very scared” to be tested on material that he had worked so hard to learn.
Ultimately, Mendes passed.
For some citizenship tutors, the process of preparing their tutees for testing can also be very personal.
Gresa Matoshi ’13, an immigrant from Kosovo, joined the program her freshman fall, soon after becoming naturalized herself.
“For me having personally gone through the process of becoming a citizen ... making it easier for someone else to learn the questions and master this test is really important, because I know I was privileged to know the [English] language and [American] history,” Matoshi says.
PURSUING THEIR DREAMS
In addition to citizenship tutoring, the Bridge Program offers classes in English as a second language, computer literacy, and GED and college preparation.
Once proficient in English and prepared for college-level academics, students of the Bridge Program often move into the Harvard Extension School to take classes at the discounted Harvard employee price of $40 per class. Many students hope to someday receive a degree.
One of these individuals is Kalan Chang, an Ecuadorian immigrant, who was naturalized this past year with help from Citizenship Tutoring. Chang says he hopes that becoming an American will help him gain access to greater opportunities as he pursues his education to become an accountant.
“In my opinion, the American dream is not a vague desire to have more, but the chance to become more,” Chang says.
When Chang immigrated from Ecuador in 2005, he says he “felt excited and lost,” in a foreign land attempting to navigate by street signs he could not understand.
Eventually, he got a job working as a custodian at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“This country has been really good to me,” he says.
“The only thing it has asked of me is to pay taxes,” he adds, jokingly.
Citizenship Tutoring volunteers have also gotten more involved in vocational and pre-professional instruction in the past year.
Under Konrad’s leadership, the program has expanded to allow student volunteers to take part in ESL and computer literacy tutoring under the umbrella of the Bridge Program.
STANDING PROUD
At the Citizenship Celebration Dinner this past Tuesday, the 18 graduates of the tutoring program were called one by one to receive certificates honoring their attainment of citizenship.
Before an audience including their family and the program staff—as well as University President Drew G. Faust and IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94—the graduates beamed as they were recognized for their accomplishments.
The undergraduate tutors were also acknowledged with a round of applause for helping to make the day possible.
But to some, being able to see their tutees succeed was more than enough reward.
“I can’t think of a program where one person can make more of a tangible impact on a person’s life,” Hutt said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who worry about balancing classes and trying to start a new company shouldn’t fret—they’re in good company. Bill Gates, arguably the University’s most famous drop out, used to fall asleep in his combanitorial applied math class because he had been up writing code all night.
But—technically—he is not a drop out.
Harvard’s leave policy—which allows students to return and complete their degree after an indefinite time of absence—is a boon for contemporary tech entrepreneurs following in Gates’ footsteps. For them, attending Harvard full-time while simultaneously building a company is an impossible balance.
John B. Collison, who would have been a sophomore in Winthrop House this year, officially went “on leave” last fall to work full time on his tech start-up, Stripe, a web company that allows businesses to charge money online—without the long processing delays of companies like PayPal.
Collison can no longer swipe into Harvard’s dorms or dining halls, but he does have access to Harvard’s libraries and can log into fas.harvard.edu.
“I think nobody ever actually drops out of Harvard,” Collison says. “It’s a very optimistic view.”
“Harvard is great because the cost of taking time off is extremely, extremely low,” Collison adds. “You just fill out a housing form.”
In a field that has volatile rates of success—according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, only six out of 1 million high-tech business ideas ultimately become companies that go public, and 60 percent of high-tech startups that get venture capital eventually go bankrupt—the decision to leave Harvard is unconventional.
And at a campus that has given birth to some of this generation’s most successful tech entrepreneurs it has become clear to those who hope to pursue their own start-ups that if they want to make their idea happen they probably have to go on leave.
While the College can provide prospective tech companies with great resources—experts in the field, business acumen, and access to a young, tech-savvy audience—it is also difficult to balance classes and a young company.
But it also represents a deal of courage to leave Harvard, according to Harry R. Lewis ’68, a computer science professor who taught both Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg before they left Harvard.
“This field is extremely dynamic—the windows of opportunity are very narrow sometimes,” Lewis muses between stories about Gates falling asleep in CS 121 and an email exchange with Zuckerberg that introduced “Six Degrees to Harry Lewis,” the precursor to Facebook.
“They both had an idea, [and] they just saw an opportunity that they recognized ... was not going to be there in six months,” he adds. “The real question is whether they’re willing to risk failure on some kind of dream they have.”
DECIDING TO LEAVE SCHOOL
Working 80 hours per week on his start up, Meir Lakhovsky was quickly realizing that building his company while taking classes at the same time was simply not a workable option.
Lakhovsky left Harvard after the fall of his junior year to co-found a Cambridge-headquartered company that helps businesses acquire new customers.
“I was evaluating my options about maybe taking easier classes and trying to split my time, but I want to take classes that I enjoy and that are meaningful. Those tend to not be the easy ones, but I also wanted to focus on the project—but it just takes up a lot of time,” he says.
Greg D. Brockman currently works for Collison at Stripe, but just over a year ago he was a sophomore at Harvard planning to transfer to MIT.
“I really wanted to get more involved—to get as good as I could at the things I was interested in,” Brockman says. “Classes had started to feel like they weren’t fulfilling that role anymore ... I wanted to be surrounded by a group of computer scientists and do computer science all the time.
And the constraints of college life lets an idea go only so far. “You just don’t have enough time to turn something from a prototype into a real product,” Brockman says.
Collison says he thinks Harvard’s decision to let students take time off is a smart move, on that he thinks “diversifies the student body.”
Max D. Novendstern ’12, a Social Studies concentrator who has never taken a computer science class, took last semester off to develop his company, CommonPlace—“a centralized networking platform” which aims to rebuild community engagement across the country by encouraging people to share civic information. He considers tech startups a “promising mode of activism.”
“Technology is about making the world better ... It doesn’t matter if you win start up awards, doesn’t matter how technically sophisticated your coding is,” he says. “All that matters is: do you have users who are actively engaged?”
THE RISK
Harvard’s tech entrepreneurs are very cognizant of the risks they are taking by dropping out of school—and equally aware that their mentality is an unfamiliar one at Harvard.
“Basically a lot of Harvard students think that the key to success is not making any mistakes. The startup mentality is making as many mistakes as quickly as you can until you find the right answer,” Novendstern explains.
For Brockman, dropping out helped him realize the importance of taking a chance on his ideas.
“I guarantee that if you don’t execute—if you don’t try—it won’t go anywhere,” he says. “It’s very easy to not pursue something because you’re not sure about it, but I don’t think that’s the right strategy.”
But not everyone is as comfortable with his risk-taking.
“My mom still, every time I talk to her, will ask, ‘So when are you going back to MIT?’” he says. “A lot of my peers tried very hard to dissuade me.”
Lewis acknowledges the reasons why students are scared to drop out of school—citing the common perception that delaying graduation will obstruct “progress” toward a professional career—but also argues that there is not actually all that much to lose.
“I say to people, if you don’t go to graduate school immediately after you graduate ... what’s the worst that’s going to happen to you? You’re going to be exactly where you would have been later in life, but you’ll reach there at 50 instead of 48,” he says.
THE ADVANTAGES OF STAYING BACK
For those with dreams of launching a tech company, the life of a typical College student can feel not only humdrum but like a constraint on their aspirations. A midnight deadline for a response paper about a half-read copy of Jane Austen’s “Emma” is difficult to balance with seeking venture capital funding, double and triple checking code, and making sure that the servers haven’t crashed.
“To be here you have to hand in response papers about really tedious Victorian novels, but on the other hand your access to resources while you’re on campus expands,” Novendstern says.
But he does not discount the advantages of being on campus and says with conviction that he plans to graduate.
Still, he may very well take more time off from the University before he gets his diploma. CommonPlace, which met with “stunning success” at its full launch in Falls Church, Va., is a major time commitment, and if Novendstern can secure funding this summer, he will not be back at Harvard in the fall.
For Axel R. Hansen ’13 and Jonah L. Varon ’13—who recently created the social networking site Newsle—access to resources has been a key factor in their decision to stay in school despite the average time commitment of over 40 hours a week running and developing the site.
The pair frequent faculty office hours with departments ranging from computer science to business because securing venture capital has been a difficult task, according to Hansen.
Server bills—which cost around $1000 a month—have driven the need to find investors, he says.
“To make something like this work you really have to be invested at all costs,” says Varon.
The ability to say they are students has also given them significant advantages in raising venture capital.
“Most investors aren’t into making an investment if you’re dropping out of school immediately,” says Hansen. The two have raised over $50,000 in investor capital to date.
THE STARTUP CULTURE
While Facebook and Microsoft both have their roots in Cambridge, the Silicon Valley in Calif. has long been considered the center of tech startups in the US. But young entrepreneurs at Harvard say that a startup culture has emerged and begun to blossom at Harvard.
“There’s this real emerging tech community here at Harvard—it’s pretty heartening to see. The institutional support for startups has rapidly expanded,” Novendstern says.
Competitions like I3: Harvard College Innovation Challenge and classes such as Engineering Sciences 20: “How to Create Things and Have Them Matter” drive innovation and collaboration at the College, according to Melissa C. Oppenheim ’12, one of last year’s I3 winners.
Novendstern says he thinks Harvard takes that startup culture one step further by encouraging students who are not traditional “techies.”
“[In] Palo Alto you’re around a bunch of people who are writing code. Here you’re around people who are studying the problems,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Class of 2014 may have already received their housing assignments, but the hawks of Harvard are still ruffling their feathers.
A pair of hawks has made their nest atop the Maxwell-Dworkin Laboratory building, and a School of Engineering and Applied Sciences team has installed a surveillance system to observe the building’s newest residents.
Until recently, a hawk’s nest was lodged on a pine tree between the Pierce and Cruft buildings at SEAS, but during a storm this past winter the tree branch broke. Another nest was built on the third floor of the Maxwell-Dworkin building, though Rosalind Reid, Assistant Dean for External Programs and Executive Director of the Institute for Applied Computational Science, noted that they do not know with certainty that these are the same hawks.
Eliza Grinnell, Communications Project Manager for SEAS, estimates that the hawks had inhabited the tree for approximately three years.
Grinnell said that the idea to set up a camera originally came from Donald F. Claflin in the SEAS facilities office who “thought it might be nice to give people a more personal connection.” Claflin could not be reached for comment.
“I think people consider them the school mascot” said Grinnell. “It’s like a little piece of nature delivered to us.”
Over the years onlookers have seen hawks hunt in Harvard’s grounds. Grinnell noted an incident in the Harvard Law School quad when a hawk swooped down next to her and picked up a squirrel in its talons. The hawks’ new location has yielded new stories: the windowsill of Robert D. Howe, Professor of Engineering and Associate Dean for Academic Programs, which overlooks the hawks’ new home, has been the site of mating activity. Howe could not be reached for comment.
The camera was set up over the course of a day, said Grinnell.
Lesley Lam, Application Programmer and Analyst for SEAS and part of the team that set up the system said that the camera is currently being modified to accommodate the increased number of hits.
The IT office will not be able to say how many hits the HawkCam has received until the end of this week.
Three eggs have been spotted in the nest, Grinnell said.
But Michael P. Rutter, Director of Communications for SEAS, wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson yesterday that it appears as though the hawks have abandoned their eggs.
“It seems there might be a sad conclusion to this short-lived story,” said Brenda L. Mathieu, a faculty assistant at SEAS who has been following the video feed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School student Jason S. Harrow and Law School Professor Charles R. Nesson appeared before the First Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday as lead lawyers in the first illegal downloading lawsuit to be brought to the federal appellate level.
Harrow and Nesson represent Joel Tenenbaum, a Boston University graduate student who was sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2008 for illegally sharing 30 music files on Kazaa.
Tenenbaum currently owes $67,500 in damages, a reduction from the $675,000 of damages originally assessed by the courts.
In Monday’s hearing, Tenenbaum and his team made a second appeal to further reduce the damages.
“The more you think about this problem, and the more sources you read, and the more you look into the history of copyright, you realize just how unprecedented this ruling is. It’s remarkable that this is the first time anything like this has ever been tried,” Harrow said about the case.
In court, Harrow and Nesson argued that Congress never intended to impose statutory damages on individuals when passing the federal copyright laws and Digital Theft Deterrence Act.
However, according to the Boston Globe, lawyers representing the RIAA argued in court that Congress had intentionally set sizable penalties for individuals who illegally download copyrighted material.
While Harrow spoke primarily on behalf of Tenenbaum during the court proceedings, Nesson posed several objections during the hearing, arguing that the task of assessing statutory damages should not be left up to the jury.
“Asking the jury to decide how big a punishment is an arbitrary task and almost disrespectful to the true function of the American jury,” Nesson said.
Nesson picked up the case pro-bono in the fall of 2008 and used it as a teaching opportunity for his students in his “Law in the Court of Public Opinion” seminar. Although he worked with several students on the project, Nesson decided to invite Harrow to lead the team in Harrow’s second year as a law student.
“Jason was attracted to the issues in the case and worked very closely with the case,” Nesson said. “I was tremendously impressed with him.”
Harrow, 27, said that if his team is victorious, the verdict will be a major triumph for his generation.
“It will make it much less feasible, and therefore much less scary, for big record companies to sue individuals,” Harrow said of a potential win. “College students are not equipped to face the threat of a federal case against them for sharing a song or posting a newspaper article on a blog. It’s scary for college kids.”
With the hearings over, the ruling lies in the hands of the three judges presiding over the case. No deadline was set for the verdict.
“The court of appeals could take weeks or months,” Harrow said. “It could go a number of ways, but we have our fingers crossed.”

Materials scientists at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have developed the first macro-scale thin-film solid-oxide fuel cell, potentially serving as a new source of clean energy.
The small size of existing thin films—membranes that must allow ions to pass through—limits their output. But after four years of research, the SEAS team has developed a way to build the miniscule membranes of the cell without sacrificing power performance.
Principle investigator Shriram Ramanathan, associate professor of materials sciences, says that the new SOFCs, presented earlier this week in Nature Nanotechnology, could help distribute energy and potentially serve as portable energy.
“It could be an inexpensive way to fabricate devices affordable for large scale [applications],” Ramanathan said.
The team must now determine, he said, where their SOFC is best applicable.
“We would like to be able to test this type of fuel cells with different fuels, like hydrocarbons or natural gasses and explore the potential for solid oxide fuel cells to become operable,” Ramanathan says.
His research at Harvard has focused on metal oxides, a class of ceramic materials that have electronic and ionic conductive qualities.
His work currently revolves around two separate programs, he says: in addition to his research on ionic conducting oxides for energy conduction, Ramanathan is also working on a new class of computing devices that incorporate phase transitions.
But he says his team’s research required the full four years.
The difficulty, he says, arose in trying “to understand all the things that go into building that device.”
Working with fuel cell chips, the team soon realized how hard it would be to make a practically relevant active area with the thicker membrane.
According to Ramanathan, “initially, we worked on small area devices just to learn about the materials and basic properties of the structures, which gave us a sense of how challenging it would be to scale up.”
Ramanathan says that the future of the new device could mean inexpensive clean energy.
“The cost need not be very large,” he says. “This is why we use inexpensive materials manufactured in inexpensive ways, because it is important to address cost issues and come up with innovative engineering designs that can mitigate additional cost barriers.”
He said his work, a collaboration of students and young scientists, has benefited greatly from the supportive Harvard community.
“It is such a big deal that the faculty encourage this kind of research and want to see this field grow,” he says.

A new combination of drug therapies may prove effective in treating triple-negative breast cancer in human patients, according to a recent study published by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Baylor College of Medicine.
Triple-negative breast cancer is one of three classes of breast cancers and the only one that currently has no readily accessible treatment, said HMS Professor Stephen J. Elledge, the principle investigator for the Harvard lab.
The only treatment option for patients with these tumors is chemotherapy, and the median survival rate for such patients is very low.
The research sought to identify classes of molecules that, when down regulated, cause a cell to gain cancerous properties.
The study, which was published last month in the journal Cell, reported that the absence of a tyrosine phosphatase enzyme called PTPN12 caused human mammary cells to gain cancer-like properties in vitro.
The researchers separately found that PTPN12 was inactive in more than 50 percent of the triple-negative breast cancers tested, showing that the enzyme plays a significant role in this class of breast cancer, Elledge said.
Thomas F. Westbrook, a former postdoctoral fellow in Elledge’s Harvard lab and currently leading the research group at Baylor, discovered the PTPN12 enzyme while still at Harvard.
That enzyme is known to deactivate another group of enzymes called receptor tyrosine kinases that are responsible for cell growth.
So when PTPN12 is inactivated, cells are free to grow and divide rapidly, like cancer cells.
The research group identified three tyrosine kinases that are specifically regulated by PTPN12. These results indicated that the misregulation of these three enzymes could be a leading cause of triple-negative breast cancer, according to the study.
“If we figure out how to inhibit different kinases together, we might be able to treat this disease,” said Elledge.
The researchers tested in mice a combination of two FDA-approved, on-the-market drugs that are already used to treat other cancers and that inhibit the desired kinases. One drug, Tykerb, is known to inhibit two of the enzymes, and another, Sutent, is known to inhibit the third.
The study found that tumors in mice that were treated with a combination of both drugs shrank by more than 90 percent, and life expectancy for these mice more than doubled.
The researchers are now in the process of negotiating with drug companies to design a Phase II clinical trial that will test the new therapy in humans.
Ellidge said, “It may take two to three years to set up a clinical trial and get results, and then we can determine whether there will be a therapy.”
Ellidge said that while the research group has identified some of the kinases that are activated in triple-negative breast cancer, there is still more research to be done in order to understand the disease mechanisms completely.

To assuage concerns over the new health care law likely to take full effect within the next several years, Director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard School of Public Health John E. McDonough says that Americans should remain optimistic about the law’s implementation and its potential benefits for the public.
The Affordable Care Act was signed into law last March by President Barack Obama, extending insurance coverage to millions of Americans.
McDonough, who helped the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy’54-’56 draft the bill, cites the Obama administration’s management skills and flexibility and the “wave of innovation” energizing the United States as several of the reasons Americans should embrace health care reform.
“It seems to me that there was a lot of focus on the negative and the risks and the clouds,” McDonough said. “I wanted to provide some kind of summary of evidence pointing in the other direction.”
According to McDonough, an improving economy and lower federal deficit will prove advantageous for the law’s preservation. He added that the act faces no considerable constitutional challenges and that all the key sponsors have continued to maintain their support.
HSPH Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis Robert J. Blendon said that people who feel apprehensive about the bill tend to fear that their insurance premiums, taxes, and the nation’s deficit will increase once the law takes full effect.
However, Blendon added that the law’s proponents say that the health care reform will cover millions of uninsured people, eliminate discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, and insurance policies will pay more of the needed services.
McDonough’s comments first appeared in a column last week for “Kaiser Health News” in which he said that he hoped to improve the public’s perception of the law for the congressmen and senators who worked to implement the reform.
Although McDonough said the health care law faces tremendous legal and political challenges, he wrote in the column that Americans can overcome “the most challenging implementation of a federal law since the civil rights laws of the 1960s.”
The column also addresses the public’s divided support of the health care bill—between 46 percent unfavorable and 46 favorable—but notes that only 21 percent of Americans support a full repeal, which has been proposed by the Republicans in Congress. The prospect of repeal poses a series of significant threats to many Americans, McDonough said.
“If this is law is repealed then 32 million Americans who are projected to be insured in the next several years will not be,” said McDonough. “Instead of having 23 million uninsured Americans we will be closing in on 50.”

When Tomo Lazovich ’11 first heard that the Fibonacci Sequence in mathematics was related to the Golden Ratio, his instinct was to go home and test the theory. After jotting down a few Fibonacci numbers, Lazovich discovered that the ratio of numbers as the series progressed really did become closer to the Golden Ratio.
“[It’s] not so exciting now,” he says. But it was at the time. He was 11 years old.
Lazovich’s early interest in mathematics paved the way for his Harvard career. A Physics concentrator with a secondary in Computer Science, he will turn in his senior thesis next week. His thesis focuses on how to identify and filter the muons, negatively charged particles that are heavier than electrons, created from proton collisions.
Lazovich has conducted research with Harvard’s Department of Physics since the summer after his freshman year, when he met Professor Melissa  Franklin, who chairs the physics department. Alongside Franklin, he has been researching data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a new particle collider in Europe that can handle what Lazovich describes is a “massive increase” in energy.
“[With the LHC], we can actually search for … a new regime of physics that we’ve never been able to test before,” he explained.
His role in the project is to develop a software that can filter the muons created from the collision in the LHC from the “background muons,” which are a result of cosmic rays from the sun that would contaminate date.
The research seeks to test the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics, which is widely accepted today. “This contributes to analyses that are trying to get at the crux of what is going on at the fundamental scale of nature,” Lazovich said.
Though he is engaged in serious research, Lazovich lets his sense of humor show, according to his friends.
“He’s crazy smart [and] crazy funny … He has this weird ability to make everyone in the room feel comfortable and everybody in said room start laughing,” Kelly P. Brock ’11, his girlfriend of around two years, said. “He’s very, very persistent in [trying until] he gets what he wants … which is why he’s such a good physicist.”
While he is very dedicated to his own research, Lazovich has found time to be a leader in the undergraduate science community.
He was co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Society of Physics Students and a TF for CS50. Lazovich plans to go on to graduate school next year, where he will work toward a Ph.D. in physics.
“I’d like to be in a position where I can do good research and help others learn about physics,” he said.
Being a university professor is not a goal that others don’t believe Lazovich can attain.
“He’s probably going to be one of those great professors [whose] class everyone wants to take,” Brock said.

Over thousands of years of eating and evolving, humans have developed the ability to learn to avoid the foods that make them sick.
This capacity, to know better than to eat another piece of that cheese that kept you awake last night with a stomach ache, is not a uniquely human trait though. In fact, according to a recent Harvard study, even one-millimeter-long worms can also develop food aversions.
Assistant Professor of Biology Yun Zhang and her team of researchers have studied the neural network of C. elegans, a small transparent roundworm, to understand how organisms use their sense of smell to learn to avoid dangers.
“The central question we’re seeking to answer is,” Zhang said, “How does the nervous system process information and adjust so that behavior can be changed?”
The team mapped the roundworms’ nervous systems, and then observed the organisms’ neural pathways while they were in action.
The research, which was featured in the December 22 issue of Neuron magazine, showed the neural circuitry by which the roundworms process information in the environment—say, the smell of a harmful bacteria—and learn to change their behavior and move away.
“They remember the smell that makes them sick,” Zhang said.
Two different neural circuits are at play here, said Zhang. The first circuit is active when the roundworms experience the pathogenic bacteria for the first time.
After they get sick, Zhang said, another circuit kicks in, effectively regulating the roundworm’s motor response so that it doesn’t go back to the harmful bacteria.
“We look at their behavior to understand the nervous system on the scale of individual neurons,” Zhang said.
While she said she hopes that this research will help illuminate the mechanisms behind human learning, Zhang stressed that the human nervous system is vastly more complex and difficult to disentangle than that of the roundworm.
The C. elegans have only around 300 neurons and are, to date, the only organism for which we have a complete connectome—a comprehensive map of an organism’s nervous system.
This feature, as well as the organism’s rapid growth rate and its transparent body, makes the C. elegans an attractive subject of study for researchers like Zhang.
Compare this simplicity to the overwhelming number of connections within a human brain. With near one hundred billion neurons and some seven hundred trillion synaptic connections, the prospect of a fully mapped human nervous system is still a while away.
“We’re still at the very beginning stages of understanding how the human nervous system is organized,” Zhang said.

As the academic term reaches its midpoint in Cambridge, 80 Ivy League student-athletes have already been rewarded for a season of hard work both in and out of the classroom. Earlier this week, Ancient Eight officials announced that ten Harvard students—including athletes from nine teams and eight different sports—earned a spot on the winter All-Ivy Academic team this year.
To be nominated for this honor, a student-athlete must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and be a starter or key reserve on a recognized varsity team.
The women’s and men’s swimming and diving teams led the way for the Crimson, as a swimmer and two divers—senior Kate Mills, classmate Zac Ranta, and sophomore Michael Stanton—earned a spot on the team.
Mills, a History of Art and Architecture concentrator, was also honored as the Career High Point Swimmer the Ivy League Championships this year, while the men’s team finished the regular season undefeated.
After helping the Crimson men’s basketball team to its first Ivy League championship in school history, sophomore guard Brandyn Curry, a sociology concentrator from Huntersville,  N.C., earned academic honors as well.
Also earning accolades for Harvard were sophomore hockey forward Jillian Dempsey , sophomore squash player Laura Gemmell, junior fencer Noam Mills, junior wrestler Walter Peppelman, junior runner Claire Richardson, and junior fencer Valentin Staller.
For the full Ivy League team, check out this Ancient Eight release.

The Crimson is ready to put non-league play behind it.
In a make-up game after Tuesday’s postponed game, Harvard baseball (3-21, 0-4 Ivy) lost to Bryant (11-13, 3-5 NEC), 12-1.
The game started slowly, with both teams going three-and-out in the first two innings. But the score quickly changed halfway through the third.
The top of the inning looked promising for Harvard after senior Taylor Halgren led off with a single. But after Halgren’s base hit, Bryant quickly retired the side, forcing a double play to end the inning.
The first two batters for the Bulldogs got on base with a hit by pitch and a walk. Freshman Colin Shepard followed with a single to right field that drove in senior teammate Tim Norton for the first run of the game.
A wild pitch advanced the runners to second and third, and sophomore Dan Muscatello hit a sacrifice fly to push the score to 2-0. After Bryant’s next two batters drove in a pair, the Crimson went to the bullpen early, calling freshman Sam Dodge into the game.
The Bulldogs manufactured their last run of inning. With one out, Bryant sophomore Kevin Brown made a break for third. After a Crimson overthrow, Brown came around to score the game’s fifth run.
Dodge got out of the inning with a strikeout and a fly out to left.
“[Dodge] was the one bright spot for us,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “I thought he pitched really well.”
Bryant led off the next inning with a double from junior Jamie Skagerlind to right. After advancing to third, three straight outs ended the inning, stranding Skagerlind 90 feet away.
Harvard had more chances in the fifth. After Bryant surrendered a walk to junior Marcus Way, sophomore Danny Moskovits hit an infield single to third base, advancing Way to second. Another hit from sophomore Robert Wineski loaded the bases with no outs.
But the Bulldogs were able to keep Harvard from scoring again, and the Crimson stranded three after a strikeout and a double play.
The Crimson finally made its way onto the scoreboard in the sixth inning. Junior Dillon O’Neill reached first on a hit by pitch, advancing freshman Jack Colton to second. A wild pitch allowed both players to move up, putting both in scoring position.
Sophomore Kyle Larrow—playing shortstop for the first time ever—flied out to center, but recorded an RBI on the sacrifice. This run ended up being Harvard’s only score of the afternoon.
Bryant, on the other hand, was not finished with scoring for the day. In the seventh, the Bulldogs came home four more times and recorded three hits in the inning, all singles.
During the bottom of the eighth, Bryant hit four more singles and scored three more runs.
In the top of the ninth, the Crimson had a man on base but was unable to capitalize on the opportunity.
“We’re just not able to put the three main components of the game together,” Walsh said. “Pitching, defense, and hitting. Today we didn’t have any of those three, and you’re not going to win too many baseball games when that happens.”
Despite the loss, there were still some positive outcomes from the game.
“It was a good day for the younger guys who don’t get much playing time to go out and get their chances and get more experience on the field,” captain Tyler Albright said.
Even after a rough start to Harvard’s season, it still has a chance to improve, as the team is only a quarter of the way through Ivy League play.
“There are some great kids on the team and everybody is working hard,” Walsh said. “We have a bunch of good ball players. We’re just not getting anything out of it so far this year in terms of winning and being able to play up to our capabilities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With graduation on the horizon, there are some things that all seniors want to make sure they do before they leave. For the Harvard men’s lacrosse team, there is still one big task that has been left unaccomplished—beating Cornell. And with the Ivy League season well underway, the Crimson will have its last chance, barring a postseason meeting, on Saturday afternoon at Soldier’s Field Stadium.
“I think this game really means a lot to the senior class,” said co-captain Dean Gibbons, who is the reigning New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (NEILA)/Skor Sports Player of the Week. “We’ve never beaten Cornell before, and this is our last shot to do it in the regular season.”
Tomorrow’s game, which will be nationally televised on CBS College Sports, carries with it much more than pride for the senior class.
The Big Red (7-2, 3-0 Ivy), ranked sixth in the country, leads the Ivy League while Harvard (6-3, 1-1 Ivy) is tied for third. A win tomorrow would keep the Crimson in the hunt for the Ivy League title and help its chances for a bid to the NCAA tournament, which Harvard has not been to since 2006.
“This game in particular is very important because Cornell is in first place and is 3-0 in the league,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “This is an opportunity to play the top team at home, so it’s got huge implications for the Ivy League race and the Ivy League tournament, so we’re looking forward to it.”
If both teams’ play so far this season is any indicator, Saturday’s matchup should be full of dominant offense. Harvard ranks seventh in the country in points per game with 18.67, while the Big Red, which has reached the Final Four in both of the past two years, is fourth with 19.89 points per game. The Crimson is also seventh in the country in goals per game, with 11.78, while Cornell is tied for second in this category, with 13.11 goals per game.
A big reason for Harvard’s offensive success has been the outstanding play of Gibbons and junior Jeff Cohen.
“Our offense really starts with Dean,” Wojcik said. “He’s our quarterback, he’s our leader on offense…He can dodge, he can shoot, he can feed, he makes all the players around him better.”
While Gibbons leads the team with 33 points, Cohen paces the squad with 22 goals for the season.
But the Crimson cannot simply rely on its Gibbons-led offense going into Saturday’s matchup.
“Our goal is really to play well in every phase of the game,” Wojcik said.
One of the important phases for Harvard will undoubtedly be its defense, which is facing one of the best offenses in the country.
On the defensive end, the Crimson will have to deal with a prolific scorer for Cornell in junior co-captain Rob Pannell. Pannell, this week’s Ivy League Player of the Week, leads the country in points per game with 5.89, a full point higher than Army’s Jeremy Boltus.
“We’re going to play our team defense, play our game,” Wojcik said. “We have faith in our [defensive] guys to do everything we can to limit Rob’s production and the ability to get that offense started. It’s a big challenge…but we’ll be prepared.”
The Big Red ranks 29th in the country in scoring defense, while Harvard is 43rd.
While a high scoring game may be more exciting, the Crimson will take a win in any fashion.
“We’re just looking to play our best and play Harvard lacrosse and, you know, put our best foot forward on Saturday,” Wojcik said.
If tomorrow’s game does, in fact, play out as a high-scoring battle, draw controls could be crucial.
Crimson senior midfielder Andrew Parchman ranks 28th in the country with a .542 face-off win percentage, while Cornell’s junior Mitch McMichael ranks 45th with a .461 win percentage.
The Big Red is coming off of a four-game win streak, while Harvard, which lost its last game against Albany, has lost two of its last three by a total of two goals.
“We’re really bummed coming off of the Albany loss,” Gibbons said.
Last year’s meeting between the Crimson and Cornell provided plenty of excitement. Harvard, leading by one going into the final quarter, was beaten in a thriller on a late goal by Pannell.
Whether the Crimson finds itself in a shootout or a low-scoring game against the Big Red tomorrow, their ultimate motive will not change.
“I don’t really have a preference,” Gibbons said. “I’d just like to see us win at the end of the day.”

The last time the Harvard softball team played against Cornell was in the 2010 Ivy League Championship Series. After forcing a third game, the Crimson fell to the Big Red, 3-2, as Cornell took home the Ancient Eight title.
Now Harvard (18-10, 4-0 Ivy) has its shot at retribution, as is it set to play the Big Red (14-12-1, 3-1 Ivy) in its Ivy League home opener this coming weekend.
But before the Crimson can prove itself in tomorrow’s doubleheader against Cornell, it has to face Princeton (10-14, 2-2 Ivy) in a two-game series on Friday.
And after splitting with both Brown and Yale last weekend, the Tigers are eager for a chance to redeem themselves as well.
“It’s definitely going be a huge weekend for us,” co-captain Ellen Macadam said. “Every Ivy game is important, but Princeton and Cornell are always ones that we especially look forward to.”
“We obviously have some unfinished business with Cornell to take care of, so we’re very excited to play them.,” Macadam added. “Princeton is always a very formidable opponent too, so they will be very, very competitive games. We’re going to need to bring our A–game, but we definitely expect to take it to these teams and come out on top.”
Since its loss in the Championship Series against Cornell, the Crimson has gained quite a few talented freshmen, including third baseman Kasey Lange and pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who have just been named Ivy League Rookie and Pitcher of the Week, respectively.
Lange—who leads the league with 28 RBI and 11 doubles—plated six runs in Harvard’s last two games, including a grand slam against Columbia on Sunday.
While Lange has been a dominant piece of the offense, Ricciardone has been a driving force on the mound, with 48 strikeouts and a 1.91 ERA, the third lowest in the Ivy League.
“All our freshmen have been playing big roles on the team, which is awesome,” said junior first baseman Whitney Shaw. “It’s great to have players who are fresh, especially when the other Ivy League teams haven’t seen them yet, because it really keeps them on their toes.”
But the real story behind Saturday’s doubleheader isn’t the talent of the Class of 2014.
It’s the pitching duel that is going to take place between Crimson junior Rachel Brown and Big Red senior Elizabeth Dalrymple, arguably the two best pitchers in the Ancient Eight.
“It’s definitely always quite the battle seeing them against each other,” Macadam said. “Dalrymple obviously has been very effective in her career, but we have seen her enough to know how to beat her. We’re definitely ready to support Rachel on our end and finally get this girl and beat her.”
Dalrymple—who is a two-time Ivy League Pitcher of the Year—currently holds a 0.77 ERA, the lowest in the league, and has amassed 102 strikeouts to go along with her 8-3 record so far this year.
Brown is currently second in the league with a 1.69 ERA, but leads in strikeouts with a whopping 178. She posts a 12-4 record and has played a large role in the majority of Harvard’s victories so far this season.
Add Ricciardone to the mix, and the Crimson has the best one-two force in the Ivy League.
“I am definitely getting pumped up for the game,” Brown said. “Elizabeth Dalrymple is a phenomenal pitcher and I’m excited for our team to face her. We’ve been practicing in preparation for this, and I think it’s going to be a matter of which team gets the offense going first. I’d like to think that we have the favor in that.”
The Harvard offense has certainly stepped up this past week, scoring 45 runs in the team’s last six games. All of these contests ended in a Crimson victory, including three games cut short due to mercy rule.
Macadam leads the league with 27 runs scored and 41 hits. She is second in the Ancient Eight in four other statistical categories.
“I feel like in the past we have let [Dalrymple] intimidate us a little bit, just by her reputation,” Macadam said. “But we’ve seen what she has and we know exactly what she throws so we’re completely ready to face her. Nothing that she has will surprise us anymore. We know what to expect and how to hit her now.”
Not only will this tomorrow’s doubleheader be a rematch of last year’s final, but it could also be a preview of the 2011 Ivy League Championship Series. This possibility makes this weekend’s series all the more important.
“In getting the team ready for this weekend I ran across a quote, ‘It’s not enough to beat a team, you have to make a large enough impact that they never want to see you again,’” Brown said. “We really want to come out [with] all guns firing and show these two teams that we are serious. If it comes down to the Championship Series, we want them to be afraid to come play us again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Different sports have different proportions of out-of-conference play.
Major League Baseball plays 18 inter-league games out of 162. National Football League teams play four out of their 16 games against non-conference opponents.
And 24 games into a 31-game season, the Harvard women’s water polo team has yet to enter the heart of their conference schedule.
After two months of non-conference games, the Crimson will finally enter conference play this weekend with matches against CWPA rivals Princeton, Bucknell, and Michigan.
“We’re all really ready to start playing games that matter in-conference,” junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski said. “We’ve come really far this season, so we are all really fired up to show our improvement.”
Harvard (13-9, 2-0 CWPA) is currently riding a three-game winning streak after a seven-game road trip to California in early March sent it teetering towards .500, a record the Crimson, which started the season 6-0 this year, has not yet experienced.
“We grew tremendously in California and you can see that in how we are playing now,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “The confidence we are playing with really cannot be measured. We are playing faster and smarter. Just taking our time and making good decisions to minimize our mistakes.”
The Crimson plays three games in two days in Lewisburg, Pa. and will be facing some steep competition, kicking the weekend off by facing the Tigers on Saturday morning. Princeton (14-9, 1-0) is currently ranked No. 18 in the country and defeated the Crimson 12-3 in the ECAC Championships in late February.  It is also coming off a narrow two-goal defeat at the hands of the No. 6 Wolverines.
“They are a solid team, with a really up-beat style,” Minnis said. “It’s a rivalry game, and with them beating us earlier in the season, we are excited about the opportunity to get them back.”
The hosting Bison (10-10, 0-1) have had an up-and-down season, going through a coaching transition.
But the Crimson has struggled on the road, going 1-6, and Harvard will certainly not be overlooking Bucknell in favor of the two more high-profile opponents.
“We really don’t know what to expect from them,” Minnis said. “We do know that they are smaller than us and that is definitely something we are going to try and take advantage of.”
The Crimson’s biggest challenge of the weekend will be matching up with conference-leading Michigan (23-4, 4-0) on Sunday morning.
The Wolverines are currently on a 13-game winning streak and haven’t lost to Harvard since 2000.
“They are a very good team,” Minnis said. “They have a ton of speed and they really counter well. They can shoot from anywhere in the pool. I really expect a lot from them. It should be a lot like what we saw in California; luckily, we are more prepared for that this time around.”
Michigan is led by Allison Mantel, who boasts 39 goals and 23 assists on the year. To come out on top, Harvard will need a solid showing from junior co-captain Devan Kennifer, who leads the team with 53 goals and 63 steals on the season.
“Devan is Devan, she’s an All-American, and she’s played that way all year,” Minnis said. “We all know what to expect from her, but Michigan does too. I can guarantee that they are going to be trying to stop her.”
Defense will also be a key factor this weekend. The Crimson is 12-1 when holding opponents below nine goals, and such a strong defensive effort will be necessary to escape Pennsylvania with a winning record. Junior goalie Laurel McCarthy has 122 saves on the season, and freshman Shayna Price was recently named CPWA Defensive Player of the Week.
“Michigan is a really quick counter-attacking team and our experience in California is going to be critical,” Zdrojewski said. “In order to have a shot, we need to shut them down defensively. Hopefully, we can do that.”
With just seven games left on the schedule before the Eastern Championships in Bloomington, Indiana at the end of April, this weekend’s games could prove pivotal in Harvard’s season.
The Crimson has received votes in the CWPA top-20 poll three times this season. In order to progress further in the poll, they will need to leave Pennsylvania with at least two, preferably three, wins.
“This is a big weekend,” Minnis said. “It’s going to require a team effort and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m really excited to see what we can do up there.”

Time for the Weekend Preview! With the temperatures finally warming up, it's important to take advantage of the good weather and watch some of these teams play outdoors.
The men’s lacrosse team has a match against Cornell tomorrow afternoon at 2:10 p.m. The Crimson squad is currently 6-3 and willl play its third conference match of the yearafter splitting its first two. The men hold a 5-0 record at home, but maintaining the undefeated record on home turf will be tough. Cornell has won the last 12 matchups against Harvard.
The softball team has two doubleheaders this weekend: two games against Princeton today and another two tomorrow against the Big Red tomorrow. The women are on a six-game winning streak and, in those six games, hold a 45-12 run lead over their opponents. Harvard fell just short of the Ivy League Championship against Cornell last year.
On the other hand, the baseball squad has not been nearly as fortunate this year, currently holding a 3-21 record. The men look to turn things around this weekend with two games against Princeton tomorrow and two against Cornell on Sunday. The Tigers hold a 10-13 record and the Big Red stand at 3-17, so there is hope the Crimson will match up well against these two teams.
Women’s tennis also has two home matches this weekend, one against Penn tomorrow at noon and another against Princeton on Sunday at the same time. It has been a seesaw season for the women’s squad, currently standing at 7-6, but the team holds a 2-0 conference record going into the weekend. Harvard dominated against Penn last year, 7-0, but lost to Princeton in a tough 5-2 bout.
The men and women’s heavyweight crew teams also have big races this weekend at home. The men face off against Brown in the Stein Cup tomorrow at 10 a.m., and the women take on Cornell and Princeton starting early tomorrow morning at 7:36 a.m. for the Class of 1975 Cup.
Finally, the Harvard men’s soccer team is hosting the Haitian national soccer team this Sunday at 5 p.m. at Harvard Stadium. Tickets are $10 for general admission but free for those with a Harvard ID. Proceeds go to benefit the relief efforts in Haiti. The barbecue starts at 3 p.m., and gates open at 4 p.m. It should be an exciting match, and many are expected to come!

Thanks to the social enterprise of one Harvard alumnus, students now have the opportunity to feed a hungry child with each Science Center stop or late-night snack.
Two Degrees Food—a company launched in January that aims to "fight childhood hunger around the world," according to co-founder William B. Hauser '08—is now selling its nutrition bars on campus, around the Square, and across the country. For every Two Degrees nutrition bar sold in the United States, the company donates one ready-to-use food pack to feed a malnourished child in Africa.
Last month, Hauser visited Malawi to deliver 10,800 nutrition packs to individuals in need.
 
All three flavors of the nutrition bars—Chocolate Peanut, Cherry Almond, and Apple Pecan—are available at the Greenhouse Café for $2.49 each and at the Quad Grille for $2 each. The bars are also sold in the Holyoke Center at Oggi's and The Harvard Shop.
 
Two Degrees Food sells its snacks at about 40 retailers and on 30 college campuses, Hauser said.
 
Through the company's Campus Director program, Priya M. Karve '12 spearheads marketing for Two Degrees at Harvard. Her responsibilities include arranging placement of the nutrition bars throughout the area and collaborating with student organizations to promote the product.
 
"I think Harvard especially is a particularly great place to be selling these bars," Karve said. "The community is really interested in doing things for social good."
 
Hauser said that the Campus Director program was inspired by his pursuits at Harvard. As president of Harvard Student Agencies in 2008, Hauser "found [his] love of business entrepreneurship." Now, he said he hopes to provide college students with similar opportunities to try out business roles.
 
"We're definitely growing and we're growing really quickly," Hauser said. "The only way we're going to be able to do this on hundreds of college campuses [is] really empowering students to lead these programs."

They're outside the Science Center with their signs, their cheer, and their smiles. They've been introducing themselves over House lists, and they want you to ask questions. They're here for you. They're the Student Mental Heath Liaisons.
 
Harvard's SMHL crew—they pronounce it smile—have recently launched a new website and recruited more members in their effort to foster an informed and understanding environment on campus.
 
In an email, the SMHL team articulated several misconceptions about mental health at Harvard that they are currently striving to clear up.
 
The liaisons noted that students receive therapy far more often than medication when they visit Mental Health Services, and that only a small number who come to Urgent Care for psychiatric help are sent to hospitals.
 
In fact, most students who visit Mental Health Services come for short-term help—typically less than six visits, according to SMHL.
 
The email emphasized that nobody should feel that the resources available at Harvard—including the Bureau of Study Counsel, Room 13, and Contact—are not for them. Mental Health Services, SMHL said, are not meant for "students who are really 'crazy.'" Everyone is entitled to a little help smiling.

Movies have the Oscars. TV has the Emmys. Now, Housing Day videos have an award all their own: the Housies!
Created by Harvard humor publication Satire V, the first-ever Housie Awards honored the best YouTube videos created for this year's Housing Day. Students voted online for the most innovative video, outstanding editing, best individual performance, and the best musical and non-musical videos.
The Housies honored the people who dedicated their time to creating videos to get freshmen excited about their new Houses. As Quincy's Michael Ardeljan '13 said while accepting the award for best editing, "This was a month-and-a-half-long collaboration. [It was] definitely very arduous—took more than my schoolwork."
Quincy dominated, with two wins for editing and the prize for best non-musical video, but many other Houses also took home the golden vuvuzelas given as awards. Currier garnered the prize for most innovative video; Pforzheimer won best individual performance; and Leverett's production was named best musical video.
A set of Harvard celebrities distributed the awards, including UC President Senan Ebrahim '12 and Vice President Bonnie Cao '12. Each presenter delivered a short monologue about the award (and often about themselves). As each presenter announced the names of the nominees, short clips from the video were shown. The winner of the golden vuvuzela was revealed, Oscars-style, after being drawn dramatically from an envelope.
Thanks to the Housies, the spirit and excitement of Housing Day continued long past the day itself.
