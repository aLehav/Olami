After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early in “Wonderful, Glorious,” Eels’ 10th album, Mark Oliver Everett delivers a statement of intent. “I’m feeling kinda fuzzy / But the future looks bright / Don’t mess with me, I’m up for the fight,” he sings. Eels are, or at any rate used to be, the archetypal 90s indie band: lo-fi, idiosyncratic, and invariably ironic. Eels were representative of an era dominated by professional ironists like Pavement. Now, in their third decade, they find themselves in a musical universe in which earnestness, as practiced by Arcade Fire or Bon Iver, has replaced sardonicism as the currency of indie. As this album shows, Eels have changed with the scene, but with mixed results.
Everett, better known as E (or Mr. E), has always been Eels’ driving force, to the extent that the band is best understood as E and his rotating supporting cast. Musically, E used to specialize in deceptively bouncy pop songs with sunny melodies and sardonic lyrics, as displayed on 1996’s “Novocaine for the Soul” and 2005’s “Hey Man (Now You’re Really Living).” On “Wonderful, Glorious,” however, this type of song is notably absent. Instead, the band alternates between tuneless but insistent three-cord hard rockers and mournful, dirge-like ballads. Eels’ music has never been more guitar-driven, and it has never been more repetitive. With the exception of the bridge on “Peach Blossom,” E’s piano—so crucial to earlier classics like “Beautiful Freak” and “It’s a Motherfucker”—makes few appearances. P-Boo, guitarist on Eels’ 2008-2009 concept album trilogy, returns here, and his riffs and solos tend to consist of a few furiously hammered notes that lack both variety and character.
Curiously, Eels’ evolution from lo-fi pop to dull hard rock is accompanied by the least depressive lyrics E has ever penned. On past albums, optimism was usually a cover for despair; when E sang, “Goddamn right it’s a beautiful day,” on 2000’s “Mr. E’s Beautiful Blues,” the irony was palpable. Here, the lyrics are as earnest as anything Win Butler or even Chris Martin could pen. At times they can sound quite unrecognizable, as on “You’re My Friend.” “You’re my friend / You done a lot of things for me / And I won’t forget them / Do you know how much you mean to me,” E sings, with not a trace of irony or self-consciousness anywhere. It is jarring to witness a lyricist who was so once so mordantly inventive reduced to writing such pap. Even worse is how easily he resorts to cliché. From “It’s a tangled cobweb that I weave” on “Kinda Fuzzy” to “You always find a way to come through in the clutch” on “You’re My Friend,” this album is full of egregiously lazy imagery; all this from a singer/songwriter whose historic strength has been his lyrics.
One aspect of Eels’ evolution is unambiguously positive. In their late 90s and early 2000s heyday, E was at best an indifferent singer. As he has aged, however, his voice has deepened into a smoky half-growl—a sort of indie Rod Stewart—and he is a richer and more expressive vocalist for it. One of the album’s finest moments is “On the Ropes”—a laid-back, folksy reflection on E’s place in the world as he enters middle age. The track is evidence of what “Wonderful, Glorious” could have been: it combines Eels’ traditional strengths—a genuinely attractive melody, and elegant lyrics—with E’s newly optimistic spirit and improved vocals. “I’ve got enough left inside this tired heart / To win this world and walk on my feet,” he sings. For a brief moment it is impossible not to be moved by his spirit.
Yet while “On the Ropes” is something of an aberration, it is worth remembering that Eels have always been a singles band and that even their best albums, such as 2000’s “Daisies of the Galaxy,” had plenty of filler. “Wonderful, Glorious” has three tracks that, in different ways, live up to the band’s best work: “On the Ropes,” “Peach Blossom,” and the title track, all of which succeed because of their musical variety. P-Boo’s plodding guitar is accompanied by E’s piano on “Peach Blossom,” while the last 90 seconds of “Wonderful, Glorious” are the best thing on the album. The song, and thus the album, culminates in a majestic combination of strings and synths as E delivers his most forceful, assertive lyrics yet: “My love is beautiful, it’s here for the taking / It’s strong and pure and utterly earth-shaking.” The newfound hope and optimism in E’s lyrics requires a musical counterpoint with vivacity and variance to complement it. The song “Wonderful, Glorious” shows that E still has plenty to offer as singer, songwriter, and bandleader, even if the album as a whole is a poor reflection of his talents.

Though rich in layers of sound, Frightened Rabbit’s new album, “Pedestrian Verse,” conveys a sweeping sense of emptiness. The first track, “Acts of Man,” opens with piano chords: a simple group of notes that is progressively covered by waves of new sound. Vocals arrive first, followed by a silky, electric hum similar in timbre to violins. The next instruments to join the building music are hollow drums, then an insistent electric guitar melody, and finally, more voices join the first. By the end of “Acts of Man,” and for the rest of the album, the themes of vulnerable loneliness disappear into compensating layers of sound. Frightened Rabbit is preoccupied with filling the vacant spaces in life with wandering, enveloping noise; this artistic obsession with emotional and musical voids is verbalized in  lead singer and lyricist Scott Hutchinson’s verse on “Holy,” “You’re acting all holy / when you know I’m full of holes.”
“Pedestrian Verse,” the band’s fourth album, stands as the group’s best effort to date, bolstered by richer lyrics and more varied instrumentation than previous work. Although the intertwining layers of sound are not new for Frightened Rabbit, the more melancholy subject matter and minor-key melodies on most of the tracks are more present in this album than in any of their previous records. The upbeat, almost teasing prologues to each track that can be found on previous albums, like “State Hospital” or “Winter of Mixed Drinks,” are missing from “Pedestrian Verse”—instead, most songs start with a few spare, sorrowful beats. Whereas the gradual layering of sound acts as a means of building momentum in Frightened Rabbit’s earlier albums, in “Pedestrian Verse,” the addition of sound seems an effort to overwhelm the loneliness and fill some musical or emotional void.
Frightened Rabbit, who hail from Selkirk, Scotland, draw much of their lyrical and musical inspiration from Scottish heritage and landscape. The five band members sing through Scottish accents and make reference to Viking origins through refrains of torches, skulls buried underneath “the paving stones,” and drunken priests. The layered quality of their sound recalls the bagpipe, which emits a dull buzzing underneath the higher, louder melody, a subtle layer that is present in most of Frightened Rabbit’s songs. Even when they are not making direct reference to the island, Frightened Rabbit’s lyrical mood is as overcast as the Scottish weather, an ambiance made apparent in the line, “The candle is blown, we start the black march home / Through a stale and silent night.”
Though the instrumentation is fresh and varied in texture, Hutchinson writes mainly about feeling alone and inadequate. His lyrics—many of which confess a desire for sleep and describe paranoid insecurities—sound all the more stark against the foil of the lush music which backs them. In many of the songs, a chorus takes over from Hutchinson, helping him towards the height of the track. The multitude of voices are a comforting contrast to the often lonely sound of Hutchinson’s vocals.
At times, these voices seem to back up the emotions of one of the performers. When Hutchinson sings, “Please don’t steal me from my house,” the voices that rise to accompany him enforce his protest. It seems that the whole album is a defense in some way: the performers intend to speak for all those who have ever felt alone. Indeed, this is such a salient theme throughout the album that there are two songs with the refrain, “You can’t carry me away now / Please don’t steal me from my house,”—the first titled “Housing (In)” and the reprise, three songs later, titled “Housing (Out).” Both songs are similar in their chorus and tempo, but the second is shorter and ends more abruptly. The two similar songs spaced between other tracks on the album contribute to its overall symmetry. When the same lyrics and melody return, it is as if the performers are returning to an unfinished thought.
“Housing (Out)” leads into the final song on the album, “Oil Slick”—a surprisingly hopeful song that seems to recall the recent BP oil spill as Hutchinson sings, “Sound like an oil slick coating the wings we’ve grown.” Frightened Rabbit leave the album with soft bird calls as an answer to the solitary feeling that dominated the beginning of the album, when the single voice and spare instrumentals left a lot of musical territory empty—they open the insular, claustrophobic emotions of the performers to outside noise at last.

“Bitches Love Me (ft. Drake and Future)”
Lil Wayne, "I Am Not A Human Being II"
“I’m on that good kush and alcohol / I got some down bitches I can call,” murmurs Future at the opening of Lil Wayne’s newest single, “Bitches Love Me.” The song—with its abundant profanity and references to weed, booze, and, of course, bitches—will, when played on the radio, have almost as many words edited out as left intact. As such, it stands a fair chance of being 2013’s “Young, Wild & Free,” a similarly irreverent hit. And yet, it is Future and Drake’s infectious and profane chorus that carries the song, while Lil’ Wayne’s two verses fall flat. His lyrics meander aimlessly, and his rhymes lack creativity, moving from “Now kiss my ass if you hating” to “I’m getting ass while I’m skating.” With this track, Wayne truly seems to be riding on the popularity of his protege Drake, whose fame and talent have eclipsed Weezy’s own.
“YOLO (ft. Adam Levine and Kendrick Lamar)”
The Lonely Island
Although the concept of YOLO has been incessantly mocked since its arrival on the pop culture scene, The Lonely Island manages to revive the humor of a stale joke with off-kilter and overly cautious advice on how listeners may prolong their lives. Among other recommendations, the boys counsel their audience to “stay the hell away from drugs / Cause they’re not legal / Then bury all your money in the backyard / Like a beagle.” However, while Levine’s soaring chorus makes the song eminently more catchy, Lamar’s verse, filled with awkward financial advice, clashes with the song’s comedy. With its quirky lyrics and pop artist cameos, “YOLO” follows the group’s standard format but doesn’t push the limits of comedy as far as some of the trio’s previous songs. Rather, the group seems to be following its own advice: you only live once, so why take any chances?
“One Way Trigger”
The Strokes, “Comedown Machine”
The Strokes recently released the first single from their eagerly awaited upcoming album, and this first taste of “Comedown Machine” does not disappoint. “One Way Trigger” begins with a staccato synthpop beat and a falsetto mumble uncharacteristic of frontman Julian Casablancas. As the guitar kicks in, Casablancas’s voice drops to his standard coarse murmur but continues to oscillate between the two registers for the remainder of the song. The highly danceable track is perhaps more reminiscent of Casablancas’s 2009 solo album “Phrazes for the Young” than a typical Strokes album, but the guitar solo in the middle harkS back to The Strokes at their best. “One Way Trigger” promises exciting new work from The Strokes.

If Boston needed a little post-holiday pick-me-up to brighten spirits before the snowstorm, it is hard to imagine a much better stress-reducer than the concert held last Tuesday night at TD Garden featuring Mumford & Sons, Ben Howard, and The Felice Brothers. In the debut performance of the Sons’ current U.S. tour, the three groups convened in what seemed an all-male family gathering in which they impressed with the folksy combination of their heartfelt lyrics and earthy instrumentals.
The first opener, Ben Howard, assumed the role of the cool older cousin. Howard was always careful to use his indoor voice, giving his performance the feel of an intimate living room set. Unfortunately, the massive TD Garden was half empty at the beginning of the concert, so the chatter of fans still trickling in detracted slightly from Howard’s indrawn performance.
The set list was short and sweet—perhaps a bit too short—and included lesser-known songs in addition to favorites like “Only Love” from Howard’s first album. Howard was unafraid to wander from the original recorded versions of his songs, easily lengthening chords and drawing out passages in a way that demonstrated his musical prowess. Sitting down with his guitar, he filled the space with his enveloping sound in a way that was simultaneously comforting and melancholy, like wrapping up in a wool blanket on a blustery day.
Later on, even Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons commented on Howard’s remarkably tranquil vibe. In between songs, Mumford complained facetiously to the audience about having to share the stage with Howard—“He’s like the nicest guy you’ll ever meet, and it just pisses you off.”
The Felice Brothers provided a more upbeat transition into the main act, although they sometimes came across like the less mature, younger siblings. Though the band moved between upbeat and downtempo songs, their Bob Dylan reminiscent ballads were all too predictable and their instrumentals did not pack the same kind of focused energy as those of either the Sons or Howard.
Decidedly not a rock band, the group seemed eager to shed its New York roots in favor of Midwestern twang, with song titles like “Whisky in my Whisky” and the occasional sung “sha-na-ny-na” piling country flair onto their washboard instrumentals. Nevertheless, the Felice Brothers seemed confused about their own identity, with two band members wearing skinny jeans and the rest Levi’s. Although the beat of their songs was often too messy to easily sway along with, their happiness felt authentic, and the band members seemed genuinely pleased to be up on stage—qualities all three acts had in common.
After much anticipation, the curtain went up and the show went down. Whereas Howard’s set was reserved and the Felice Brothers’ sounded like a roughly-cut hodgepodge of folkish ditties, Mumford & Sons came onto the stage with all of the finesse and presence of a seasoned father figure, stomping and swaying in their collared shirts with an air that said, “yes, we are what you have been waiting for.” And for all of the hype surrounding their latest album and speculation over whether the band can forever live up to its self-proclaimed “unashamed” sound, the Sons indisputably delivered.
From the first chord of their opening number, “Babel,” the crowd was hooked. Mumford & Sons played each note with the well-rehearsed vision that has earned them their international rock-star status. It took nearly an orchestra of musicians to produce the kind of sound in the incredibly polished “Winter Winds,” but whether the four men were playing by themselves or surrounded by trumpet players, there was nothing uncertain about the way they performed; their lyrics saturated with emotion and instruments working as hard as the light crew, Mumford & Sons gave clearly more of a show than the other two acts. This seemed to be just fine with the audience, who at times raised their palms to the sky in mock religious observation.
Speaking to Mumford & Sons’ widespread appeal--middle-aged fans outnumbered teenagers by far (perhaps due to the steep price of tickets) and seemed just as enthused as their younger counterparts. Sweatshirts and baseball caps abounded, although the concert did draw the occasional hipster.
One of the band’s biggest criticisms is that all of its songs sound the same, but while Marcus Mumford’s now iconic croon powered each song, the set list packed enough energy to never seem repetitive and demonstrated considerable variety of chord progression and tempo, contributing to a show that had just the right amount of ebb and flow. Opening crowd-pleasers like “Little Lion Man” and “I Will Wait” built up a mood of enthusiasm that lasted throughout the night, even for less sensationalized numbers.
Mumford & Sons has excellence down to a science. They know how to please a crowd, how to throw themselves into their songs as though performing for the first time, and it makes for a fantastic concert. With sweat dripping from their once-coiffed hair, they finished the show by suddenly emerging on a different stage for the encore. Singing a cappella, the men ended on a more subdued note by performing a few gentler numbers, but not before imploring the crowd to be “really fucking quiet,” which naturally lasted all of thirty seconds.
Between the bittersweet melodies of Ben Howard and the infectious energy of Mumford & Sons, the concert was accessible while still showcasing ample artistic talent. Perhaps because they play instruments like banjos and acoustic guitars, all three groups performed the kind of music best seen live, and their distinct styles complemented each other nicely. As such, it was a uniquely moving concert, marked by the passion of the performers and the delight of the audience.

The Harvard men’s tennis team earned a third-place finish in the ECAC Men’s Indoor Tennis Championship on Sunday with a 4-3 victory over Princeton (3-3) at the Reis Tennis Center. The team bounced back from Saturday’s 4-2 defeat in the semifinals to its hosts, Cornell. The Big Red upset second-seeded Columbia on Sunday to win the tournament in front of its home crowd in Ithaca, N.Y.
The Crimson (6-4) entered the tournament as the first seed and took down rival Yale, 4-2, on Friday but ran out of gas against Cornell. According to head coach Dave Fish, the team was still very happy with its performance this weekend after the rebound against the Tigers, especially given the circumstances.
“We are still hoping that we can get our whole squad back and assembled,” Fish said. “So I think what we’ve done so far has exceeded our expectations.”
HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 3
On Sunday, Harvard played without its No. 1 player, sophomore Denis Nguyen, due to injury. Its usual No. 3, sophomore Alex Steinroeder, moved up to the second slot despite having been in the hospital the night before.
Even with the adversity, the rest of the team stepped up and delivered. The match began with singles on Sunday. Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, playing at No. 1, went down to Princeton’s Matija Pecotic, the third-ranked player in the country, but junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and freshman Nicky Hu both won to give the Crimson a 2-1 lead.
Steinroeder lost a close match, 7-6 (5). 6-4, and freshman Kelvin Lam, stepping in at No. 6, lost in three sets. But co-captain Andy Nguyen tied it at 3-3 after a comeback victory, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, so doubles were necessary to decide the match.
In doubles, Andy Nguyen and Hu took an easy win on the first court, 8-3. On the second court, Lam and MacMaster were down a break, 6-5, but broke the Tigers’ serves twice to win 8-6 and give Harvard the 4-3 victory.
“It was really just tremendous play,” Fish said. “The tennis quality was so high, and the team just didn’t quit.”
CORNELL 4, HARVARD 2
On Saturday, both Harvard and the Big Red came into the match hot—each team had won its last three matches—but Cornell was the team that got off to a fast start. MacMaster and Denis Nguyen got an easy 8-2 win in No. 1 doubles, but Steinroeder and Chaudhuri went down 8-5 at No. 3, leaving the doubles point up to Andy Nguyen and Hu.
The pair led, 7-6, but eventually lost, 8-7(4), giving the doubles point to Cornell.
In singles, the Big Red won three matches in straight sets to gain the victory. At No. 5, Hu went down, 6-2, 6-4; Cornell’s Quoc-Daniel Nguyen took down Andy Nguyen, 7-5. 6-3, on the fourth court; and Denis Nguyen lost, 6-2, 7-5, in the first slot.
Chaudhuri gave credit to the Big Red for competing hard.
“They played a really good tournament,” Chaudhuri said. “Nobody really expected them to pull it out, but they came prepared and played well the whole weekend, so hats off to them.”
HARVARD 4, YALE 2
On Friday, in its first round matchup, the 47th-ranked Crimson took down the archrival Bulldogs, 4-2.
For the second straight year in the tournament, Harvard was too much to handle for eighth-seeded Yale, starting in doubles, where Hu and Andy Nguyen scored an 8-5 win on the second court.
Chaudhuri and Steinroeder followed with an 8-5 win of their own to give Harvard the doubles point. Next, in singles, MacMaster beat the Bulldogs’ Zachary Dean, 6-2, 6-2, at No. 6, and Hu staked Harvard to a 3-0 lead with his 6-4, 6-4 win.
Yale would come back from the deficit by winning two singles matches, winning three-setters over Chaudhuri and Steinroeder to make the match 3-2.
But Andy Nguyen, playing on the No. 4 court, finished the match off for Harvard. Nguyen outlasted Bulldog freshman Jason Brown, 10-8, in the third-set tiebreaker for a 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (8) victory that gave the Crimson the 4-2 final margin.
“The tournament was the first time we faced Ivy League opponents,” Chaudhuri said. “I feel like seeing our competition this weekend is helpful because we now know what we need to work on and improve on to be ready for the actual league season.”
The ECAC Championships showed the team the physical and mental toughness necessary as it moves forward toward Ancient Eight matches.
“We had to reset emotionally [after the Cornell match], and we learned a lot about handling pressure,” Fish said. “Unless you go through it, you won’t be ready for the Ivy League season.”

With a historic win against Princeton two weekends ago in the books, the No. 16 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had just one dual meet left on its schedule. Having taken down all other opponents, the Crimson (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) had its eyes set on an undefeated dual meet season. All that stood in the way was one last matchup against conference foe Penn.
“That [win against Princeton] was huge for us,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We had never beaten Princeton in their home pool before, so we had a tremendous amount of momentum coming off of that. Everyone was really excited to get back to the pool.”
Harvard would have to wait an extra week to face off against the Quakers due to weather conditions that made travel near impossible last weekend. But it was business as usual for the Crimson, who took down Penn, 195-98, to conclude its perfect season.
“For this meet, more so than in the past, [we] were orienting ourselves for our championships meets at the end of the season,” fellow co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “Today was really about toughness and competing and staying aggressive. We did that.”
Harvard got off to a hot start, as sophomore Chuck Katis and juniors Jack Pretto, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite combined for a time of 1:30.66 to win the 200 medley relay. Lee went on to pick up a victory in the 100 butterfly later that afternoon.
The Crimson picked up wins in the next three straight events. Sophomore Mike Gaudiani finished with a time of 9:23.61 to claim a victory in the 1000 freestyle. Roop edged out teammates freshman Ty Rocca and senior Ryan Cutter for a 1-2-3 finish for Harvard in the 200 freestyle. Pretto hit the wall in a time of 50.24 for a win in the 100 backstroke.
The Crimson concluded with wins in eight of the final 12 events, for a total of 12 victories on the day. Freshman Christian Carbone and classmate Christian Yeager won the 200 butterfly and the 200 backstroke, respectively, and junior Danny Crigler picked up a win in the 50 free. Crigler also finished second to sophomore Griffin Schumacher in the 100 free. Roop rounded out the top three in the event for another 1-2-3 finish for Harvard.
The Crimson also swept the podium in the 500 free. Satterthwaite finished in a time of 4:36.23 to take top honors, closely followed by Gaudiani and fellow sophomore John Bailey. The trio finished within three seconds of each other and over eight seconds ahead of their next nearest competitor.
Sophomore Michael Mosca claimed top honors in both of the meet’s diving events, taking home first in the three meter and one meter contests. Harvard claimed the top four spots in both events.
The win on Senior Day capped the Crimson’s second undefeated season in the past three years.
“It was a little bit surreal, after the meet when I realized it was the last time I would ever swim a meet in our home pool,” Roop said. “But it was so sweet going out knowing you had beaten everyone in the league.”
In addition to being Senior Day, another added focus for the day’s events was on the team’s “Ironman” challenge.
“We have a tradition on the team every year where the freshman who best exudes the qualities that characterize HMSD is elected Ironman for his class,” Wurzbacher said. “He is required to swim in every single heat of every single event. It’s a really challenging individual thing to do. One of the most fun parts of the season is being out there, supporting him through that.”
This year, freshman Jacob Luna was elected the honors for the Class of 2016. In addition, Katis, a sophomore, competed in all the day’s swimming events as well. Katis, who has already qualified for this year’s NCAA Championships, was unable to complete his Ironman last year due to scheduling issues.
Now with its dual meet schedule concluded, Harvard has its eyes set solely on its championship meets in the coming weeks. The Crimson’s main goal for the entire season has been reclaiming the Ivy League title from No. 20 Princeton.
“The best perspective we can have is to view ourselves as underdogs,” Wurzbacher said. “The facts are that Princeton has won the Ivy League Championship every single one of the past four years. Princeton’s the favorite. They’ve won four years in a row. But we’re going in to upset them.”
In total, the Crimson earned first place in 12 of the day’s 16 events.

With just over one minute to play in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s contest against Princeton, sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi corralled from freshman Siyani Chambers and slammed the ball home. And though the sizable crowd at Lavietes Pavilion got to its feet on the play, the dunk—the sophomore’s second of the night—served largely as an exclamation point, pushing his team’s lead to a comfortable 13 points.
On the penultimate possession of the game, Princeton guard TJ Bray got to the line after collecting his own rebound. But his 1-of-2 effort from the stripe was for naught—the game was already over.
The Crimson (15-7, 7-1 Ivy) worked the ball down the court one last time as the clock expired. And with that, Harvard had outlasted its biggest Ivy competition, 69-57, in front of a packed crowd on Saturday evening.
“I think we had a hunger here [Saturday] that really started for us [Friday against Penn],” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was anxious to see how we could turn it back around and continue that.”
Just 30 seconds into the second half, sophomore Kenyatta Smith converted a layup to stretch his team’s slim lead to six. Though Princeton (12-9, 5-2) held as much as a four-point advantage in a first half that featured 12 lead changes, that was as close as the Tigers would come for the remainder of the game.
Just 8:06 later, a Crimson squad that trailed the Tigers for a solid portion of the first half was up 11 after sophomore Wesley Saunders finished an and-one opportunity.
After Princeton threatened to come back, shrinking the scoring gap to six points off two Denton Koon free throws and a three-point play from Will Barrett, Smith converted a shot from inside with 8:52 to play. One block and 22 seconds later, Smith found his way to the free-throw line, where his two made shots boosted his team’s lead to 10.
From there, the game returned to the back-and-forth nature of the first half once again. But the Crimson was able to maintain its comfortable advantage.
After 20 minutes of play, the Crimson held a slim 32-28 advantage over the only other Ancient Eight team that entered the weekend with a single tally in the loss column.
“We liked what we were doing in the first half and we weren’t trying to change [in the second half],” Amaker said. “We needed to do a better job defending the three-point line. They had a couple in the first half and we were not happy with the ones they got. I thought we did that in a terrific way.”
Although the Tigers led by as many as four points with 11:25 remaining in the half, everything was all tied up with 2:31 to go after freshman point guard Siyani Chambers converted a jumper.
With just under two minutes to play in the opening frame, Saunders stole the ball and pushed it up the court. And although classmate Steve Moundou-Missi—who tallied a team-high eight points on the half, including a monster dunk over Princeton forward Ian Hummer with with 7:56 to go—missed his attempt from midrange, the Crimson found itself with the ball once again in the ensuing scramble.
After another Harvard miss—this time from Saunders—Chambers collected the rebound and found co-captain Laurent Rivard, who knocked down a wide-open three point attempt to secure his first points of the game and put his team up, 29-26.
And although Princeton’s Hans Brase dunked the ball on the other end, Harvard was able to hold onto its lead.
In the final four seconds of the period, Rivard attempted two more threes. Princeton forward Ian Hummer blocked the first, but Rivard collected the rebound and finished his third look from deep at the buzzer.
Smith and Moundou-Missi led the Crimson with 14 points, while Hummer paced the Tigers with a game-high 18.
“I’m a sixth man,” Moundou-Missi said. “I come off the bench looking to rebound the ball and put my team in a good position to win the game.”
With the victory, Harvard remains atop the Ivy standings as the lone Ancient Eight squad with just one loss.
“Our league is very tough and challenging and it has been for my tenure at Harvard, and I have said that every time,” Amaker said. “I’m glad our league is recognized as such.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After knocking off No. 9 Penn State Friday night in straight sets, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was riding high heading into Saturday’s matchup against St Francis. And despite some early hiccups, the Crimson was able to cap off one of the greatest weekends in program history with its second straight-set conference victory in as many days against the Red Flash at the Malkin Athletic Center.
After the team’s first-ever win over the Nittany Lions and an earlier 3-0 defeat of St. Francis on Jan 25th, Harvard (7-2, 3-1 EIVA) entered the game as heavy favorites against its conference rivals. But stretches of sloppy play combined with strong pressure from the Red Flash (5-9, 2-3 EIVA) made life difficult for the home team, which required some late rallies to secure the match.
“We definitely did not play our best,” said junior libero Chris Gibbons, who led his team with 11 digs. “We knew it would be tough coming off such a high-adrenaline win [against Penn State]… and come back and focus on St. Francis.”
Harvard coach Brian Baise acknowledged that his team struggled dealing with the emotional effect of the Penn State win.
“We know that to compete at this level and reach the goals that we have, we have got to be able to play Friday-Saturday matches,” Baise said. “We have to be in shape enough to and strong enough mentally to play hard.”
St. Francis did not appear intimidated early in the contest, and Harvard struggled to control its energy as the Red Flash stormed out to a 10-6 lead. The Crimson began to edge its way back into the game behind several attack errors and kills from junior outside hitters Nick Madden and Kyle Rehkemper, taking a 19-17 lead and forcing a St. Francis timeout. But the stoppage did not halt the Crimson’s momentum, as the squad held its lead for a 25-23 win.
Baise credited St. Francis’ strong play to a solid service game and blocking that knocked Harvard out of its offensive rhythm.
“We were not quite as sharp, but mentally we hung in there and the guys got the point when we needed them,” Baise said. “We were in sync in stretches, and we had to fight and labor a little bit to get through.”
Gibbons also nodded to the Red Flash’s strong play, but acknowledged that his team did not make the match easy.
“[We had] mistakes coming on our side–whether it was passing, defense, or hitting,” Gibbons said. “We had to clean up a few things on our side where we were making errors.”
The second set was a frame of runs for both teams, as they exchanged leads early. But some strong blocking from St. Francis gave the team a slight advantage, 17-15, before Baise called a timeout. The Red Flash continued to hold its ground, extending its lead to 21-18.
But some strong defensive play from the home side, anchored by Gibbons, kept several strong hits from St. Francis alive and allowed the Crimson to cash in some chances. The service and offensive passing began to warm up, as well. Sophomore DJ White notched five of his team-high 12 kills after the Harvard timeout. As Harvard seemed to look more like the team it was on Friday night, the Crimson was able to march on a seven-point run to close out the second frame, 25-21.
The momentum continued for Harvard, as the Crimson raced out to an 8-4 lead to begin the third frame. More attack errors from the Red Flash put the visitors in a deeper hole at 13-7.
But, as it did all night, the Red Flash persisted. After applying some offensive pressure, St. Francis was able to pull within two, 22-20, before Baise called a timeout to settle his squad’s nerves.
The tactic worked, as Harvard and the Red Flash traded points, pushing on to a 25-22 victory for the Crimson.
After not dropping a set all weekend and taking a 3-1 record away from its two Pennsylvania rivals on the season, Gibbons feels his team is ready to handle any competition left in the coming months.
“There are a lot of good teams left to play in our league,” Gibbons said. “We know that we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but this weekend was a good confidence booster. [Friday night] was probably the best volleyball we’ve played all season, so we are very confident going forward.”

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
Getting an authentic taste of Asia in America is a challenge, especially for someone who has lived in an Asian country for most of her life. Takemura, a Japanese-Korean restaurant in Harvard Square, still has some "Americanized" flavors, but it does accomplish the task of satisfying people's cravings for ethnic cuisine.
For an appetizer, Kabocha Nimono ($5.95), or boiled Japanese pumpkin, arouses an appetite for sweet and savory flavors. The naturally sweet pumpkin, diced into three large chunks, is soaked in a slightly watered-down soy sauce.
The Spicy Rainbow Roll ($10.95) is sliced into eight bite-sized pieces. The roll has tuna and salmon on top with white fish and spicy tuna inside. It is certainly not a dish suitable for those who feel squeamish consuming raw fish.
Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap ($15.95), one of Korea's most traditional meals, was a huge disappointment. The dish was supposed to be served in a sizzling stone pot, but instead it came in a lukewarm bowl. The balance between the amount of vegetables and the rice underneath was a bit skewed.
Besides a selection of Korean food and sushi rolls, Takemura also serves tempura, sashimi, and teriyaki.

Ash Wednesday has come and gone, but it's not too late to participate in Lent, a Christian tradition wherein observers give up a luxury for the 40 days leading up to Easter Sunday.
Even though Lent is Christian, and it's already started, the principle of "you don’t know what you have until it's gone" is still in place, and most Harvard students could benefit from a greater sense of appreciation—or fewer Sunday Sundaes—in their lives. For those looking to get into the spirit of Lent, here are some suggestions of sacrificial offerings, ranked by difficulty.
Harvard gear. On those cold and overcast days, nothing seems more comfortable a pair of Harvard sweats or a Harvard pullover to get you through your classes—you don't have think about you're going to wear, and it says "Harvard" on it, so really you're just showing school spirit, right? Wrong. We all know that you're just relying on the Harvard brand, and when that happens, we become this. So just don't.
HBOGO. HSA somehow thought that because Harvard students are already so productive, we'd need free streaming television and HBO to help us let loose and have fun. The result? A 140% reduction in productivity and a 120% rise in "Girls" viewership (Note: Stats are from this writer's intuition and personal experience). So do yourself a favor, and open a textbook instead of HBO.
HUDS Desserts. We're talking about the apple crisp, the double chocolate chip cookies, the pecan pie, and—you know this one was coming—Sunday Sundaes. This is going to be a hard one, especially if HUDS is also serving some form of tilapia or sole the same day, but if you truly love thyself, you should shy away.
Drunk eating. For some inexplicable and frustrating reason, when it's 2 a.m. on a Saturday night, there's nothing more satisfying than an Insomnia cookie, or a Felipe's quesadilla. If you do give this up, just know that while it may be incredibly upsetting to watch your friends scarf down slices from Noch's, some people are actually giving up their smartphones for Lent. Can you even imagine? So clutch your phone closer and ignore the smell of pizza—you're going to get through this.
Coffee. For you ambitious ones skipping to the bottom of the list, this is only to be attempted by the bravest souls. No coffee means no caffeine, which means that you'll be tired during the day, tired in Lamont, tired during your meetings—giving up coffee is going to involve a fundamental change in the way you work and sleep. You have been warned.
