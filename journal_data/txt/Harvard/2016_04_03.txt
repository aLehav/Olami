After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although a popular and internationally reputed composer in his day, Antonio Salieri lives on in the public mind almost solely due to his role as the antagonist in the 1984 film “Amadeus.” Few of his works are still performed widely, least of all his operas. This state of affairs seems particularly unjust after viewing the Lowell House Opera’s charming production of Salieri’s “La Grotta di Trofonio.” LHO’s take on “Trofonio,” which runs through April 2 in Lowell’s (impressively altered) dining hall, succeeds despite vocal and other challenges due to an abundance of energy, enthusiasm, and good-natured humor.
“La Grotta di Trofonio,” directed by Roxanna K. Myhrum ’05, tells the story of Aristone (Ethan Sagin) and his two daughters, Dori (Sarah Mitchell) and Ofelia (Charlotte L. McKechnie ’15), who are both preparing to be married. Their would-be husbands mirror the girls’ natures perfectly; Artemidoro (Andy J. Troska ’17) is as studious and serious as Ofelia, while Plistene (Andrew Sokol) shares Dori’s vivacity and love of fun. A run-in with renowned philosopher Trofonio (Nyiko Ngobeni) and his enchanted personality-altering cave throws everything into disarray, with predictably laughable results.
Vocally, the cast excels at moments and struggles in others; McKechnie and Mitchell perform more strongly than their counterparts. McKechnie’s voice cuts through space beautifully when she hits her upper register—an ability she showcases in “D’un dolce amor la face” and “E un piacer col caro amante.” Mitchell also shines vocally, although her vibrato occasionally seems to take charge of her voice. Her best moment comes at the start of the second act, when she laments Plistene’s sudden change into a stiff, officious would-be philosopher (“Un bocconcin d’amante”). Mitchell’s performance of the aria mixes mischievous humor and a clear, confident delivery of Salieri’s flowing melody with endearing results.
Troska and Sokol, on the other hand, have a harder time executing vocally. At times, both find themselves locked in competition with the orchestra to be heard. Troska is particularly susceptible to this tendency. On some of his high notes, his voice becomes truly impossible to detect (although he manages these notes increasingly well as the opera goes on). Sokol also has moments in which his voice fails to fill the performance space: Mitchell effectively drowns him out for much of the duet “Ne lo stato conjugale” in the first act. However, whatever difficulties Troska and Sokol have vocally they make up for with exuberant stage presence. They infuse their characters with a generous amount of hyperbole, a choice that might seem over-the-top in a different production but suits Salieri’s farcical comedy perfectly (and becomes even funnier when Plistene and Artemidoro’s characters change diametrically).
Surprisingly, stage presence and vocal ability come together most strongly in the opera’s remaining two cast members, Sagin and Ngobeni. Both possess rich, full baritones that seem particularly powerful set against Troska and Sokol’s tenors; during Trofonio’s crucial moments, Ngobeni’s voice holds its own against the orchestra at its full sway. Sagin manages to achieve both resonance and agility in arias like the rapid-fire “Trofonio, filosofo greco—coro di spiriti?” He commands each of his scenes, not only with his vocal strength but also with his humor and charisma onstage.
The opera’s staging exhibits the same mix of verve and occasional clumsiness as the cast’s performances. The set, which is partly a columned courtyard and partly Trofonio’s rocky lair, is ingeniously divided by Mark Buchanan’s lighting, and it is impressively multidimensional for having been constructed within a dining hall—Trofonio’s cave is particularly well-done. Screens on ceiling-high banners framing the stage display the English translation of the libretto in a more visible and convenient way than in some professional opera houses. There are also moments of amateurishness, though: At the beginning of a recent night’s performance, the crew couldn’t find the correct stage lighting for several minutes as the audience waited in increasingly awkward silence. In addition, the surtitles sometimes fail to keep pace with the music, robbing certain moments of their comedic or emotional impact.
While “Trofonio” is not without flaws, none of its missteps prevent the show from being utterly enjoyable. Its zest and cheerfulness, paired with Salieri’s lyrical music (and the goofy-but-engaging storyline), make it an incredibly accessible performance. LHO’s production—the U.S. debut of “Trofonio”—makes a convincing case that Salieri’s operas are worthy of further attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after a disheartening loss to Sacred Heart, the Harvard men’s volleyball team looked to regroup with a pair of home matches against cellar-dwelling Charleston (4-21, 0-12 EIVA).
Two days later, consider the mission accomplished. In a pair of lopsided wins, the Crimson (11-8, 7-3 EIVA) moved beyond memories of recent defeat and slipped into second place in the EIVA.
“These wins were huge for us,” sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch said. “This was a big confidence-booster coming off our loss last week to Sacred Heart.”
HARVARD 3, CHARLESTON 0
The Golden Eagles haven’t had much to celebrate in 2016.
Heading into this weekend’s play, Charleston boasted four wins overall, none in the conference, and a bus full of pent-up energy.
On Saturday some of that excitement found release in the third set, when a service error by Gretsch trimmed Harvard’s lead to 8-6 and elicited an extended scream from the Golden Eagles’ Conner Brandland.
But the celebration turned out to be empty noise, as the Crimson won five of the next eight points and closed out the clean sweep.
“We scouted this time pretty deeply,” sophomore setter Marko Kostich said. “We put in a lot of work to make sure we were in a position to play against their athletic players.”
Most of the match was not nearly as tense, with Harvard taking the first two sets by double-digit margins. Gretsch topped Harvard with 11 kills, Kostich racked up 30 assists—more than double the next highest player—and the team hit .484 overall.
The efficient performance included a first frame in which the Crimson won eight of the first 10 points. Harvard eventually won the set, 25-12, thanks to a .706 kill efficiency.
The only time that Charleston led was in the third set—at 4-3 and 5-4. But a Gretsch service run gave the Crimson breathing room and ultimately facilitated a 25-19 victory.
Three Harvard players—Gretsch, junior outside Casey White, and captain Branden Clemens—posted at least seven kills and a .500 hitting efficiency. No Golden Eagle achieved this feat.
“We polished up our fundamentals, so I think we’re feeling a lot better,” Kostich said. “It’s going to be a battle regardless. I’m looking forward to it because I know we’ve been working hard.”
As in the first set, Harvard never trailed in the second and claimed a 25-15 win.
HARVARD 3, CHARLESTON 1
On Friday night, about 30 minutes into play, the wheels appeared to be coming off for the Crimson.
While Harvard had sped through the first frame, Charleston had taken control of the second with a 7-0 streak that put them up, 16-9.
A Crimson timeout ignited a 5-1 counter-surge, but with the game tied at 21-all, the Golden Eagles had accelerated ahead with a four-point run to take the second frame.
This was the background for a tense third set in which Charleston held a lead as late as 15-14. But a five-point run saved Harvard and granted the hosts the set, 25-21.
“We kind of struggled… but we came back,” Gretsch said. “We were pretty mentally strong, brought a lot of fire.”
On the night, Gretsch led his side with 15 kills on a .565 hitting rate, and Clemens added 14 more.
It was all business in the fourth frame, as Harvard built an early six-point lead and led from then on, eventually powering to a 25-14 frame.
This narrative was similar to the first frame, when the Crimson used a 7-2 stretch to turn a one-point advantage into a gaping six-point hole. Harvard never trailed in the set, which it won, 25-13.
But the Golden Eagles were resistant in the second, thanks to an extended service run in the middle of play. Harvard had hit .571 in the first frame, but was limited to .080 in the second.

In all honesty, I don’t know why we need another Harvard Shop. This marks the fourth of this same store within 2 blocks of each other. I know tourists love to collect gear, but are there really that many of them willing to buy overpriced t-shirts emblazoned with the name of this fine institution? OK, yes, maybe there are… but with all the other tourist trap apparel shops around, the market seems oversaturated, and supply must be so much higher than demand*.
Despite my reservations about the opening of yet another Harvard Shop, I am never one to turn down offers of free food and thus woke up at the absurdly early hour of 11:30am on a beautiful Saturday to let them peddle their wares to me.
By the time I got to The Harvard Shop, it was packed full of students with the same thought process. The Lowkeys performed a fun mashup of Justin Bieber songs, and I got free cookies (and coupons for more free cookies). I think I missed a whole collection of coupons for other restaurants in the square, but I mostly only eat cookies for every meal, so that wasn’t a huge concern.
To my surprise, HSA’s grand opening was a really fun event and an example of what Harvard should be doing for inclusive social spaces (UC, take notes). Any party that has cookies and Biebs mashups is the kind of party I want to be at. I can’t imagine that I will be returning to the newest Harvard Shop to spend my own money, but I am not opposed in any way to eating their free food or enjoying the fun of a grand opening.
*Does using the few economics terms I remember from Ec10 make this a legitimate criticism? Maybe. Am I going to continue to use words from the natural and social sciences to sound like I understand anything other than literature? Definitely.

This Saturday, just after 7 p.m., members of a certain a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine made a feeble, short-lived attempt at humor. Earlier today, Lampoon staffers sent emails over club and House lists announcing that the Crimson president’s chair would “depart on its eternal journey into Space.” This was to be the latest in a long history of pranks between the two organizations, including most recently the Lampoon’s duping of Donald Trump. 
Ever-fascinated by new advances in space exploration, we at Flyby braved the cold with high hopes of seeing new breakthroughs in chair-launching technology—or at least, a mildly amusing prank. Unfortunately, we were met with neither.
Arriving at the Lampoon’s castle at 6:45 sharp, per the email’s instructions, we joined a crowd of fellow Crimson writers.  Even Crimson president Mariel A. Klein ’17 was present, decked out in purple and yellow—the Lampoon’s colors—in anticipation of the big event.
Unfortunately, except for the Crimson squad, turnout appeared to be quite low. The small crowd huddled between Mt. Auburn and Bow Street didn’t appear to be much larger than the membership of the Lampoon. (Perhaps there will be a larger turnout at the Lampoon’s “Farewell Chair” open party tonight at 11 p.m., when people can drink until the Lampoon actually seems funny...)
After about 10 cold minutes, a few dressed-up Lampoon members came forward and began to inflate a large white balloon. We pulled out our phones to begin frantically live-tweeting, only to realize that we would be forced to wait another 10 minutes or so for the actual prank to begin while the ’Poonsters struggled to tie the balloon to a poor imitation of the Crimson’s chair.
After much fanfare and anticipation (and with the balloon finally secured to the chair), the Lampoon set the chair free, watching as it drifted toward space.
Just kidding—the balloon, like the ’Poonsters' future careers in comedy, failed to launch. Only after a member picked up the "chair" and threw it, narrowly missing a car and breaking the chair in half, did the balloon finally escape toward a better place.
All in all, we weren’t surprised that the Lampoon’s prank was a waste of time and not funny, though we do hope they’ll step up their game for the next round of pranks, to prove that they aren’t just full of hot air.
