After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2010-2011 squash season ended in tournament losses for Harvard’s top players, sophomore Laura Gemmell and freshman Gary Power. Gemmell suffered her first collegiate loss when she fell in the finals of the Women’s Collegiate Squash Association Individual Championships, and on the men’s side, Power failed to make past the round of 16.
But, despite the tough endings, both Power and Gemmell dominated during the season. For their play, the duo has a host of accolades.
In his first year on the men’s squad, Power played in the No. 1 spot, meaning he would consistently have to face some of the nation’s best. The freshman stepped up to the challenge, winning 10 of his 15 matches en route to a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy League Team.
Gemmell, following last year’s national championship, continued her dominance in the 2010-2011 season, blowing through the competition until losing to Yale's No. 2 Millie Tomlinson in the Individual National Championship. Despite the loss, Gemmell has still won 97% of her collegiate matches.
With a 16-1 record this season, the sophomore not only made the All-Ivy League team, but she also was named the Ivy League Squash Player of the Year for the second-straight season. Additionally, Gemmell was named to the CSA first-team All-America.
Gemmell’s teammate junior Nirasha Guruge also earned All-Ivy League and CSA first-team All-America honors thanks to a 12-5 record in the No. 2 spot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a widely known fact that Harvard is home to more Division-I varsity sports than any other university in the country. Less widely acknowledged are the numerous club sports teams that also represent the Crimson against other schools and at tournaments around the country.
This is no surprise many Harvard students played sports in high school,  while only a few play at the college varsity level. Despite the  abundance of other extracurriculars that are available at Harvard, there  is obviously something about physical competition that appeals to  students regardless of whether they’re able to make the varsity team or  not.
Some of these club teams are the remainder of the former JV system, and many have varsity counterparts. These teams include (but aren’t limited to): basketball, tennis, lacrosse volleyball, hockey, fencing and baseball. However, unlike in the old days, crossover between club teams and the varsity roster is rarely occurs.
Others club teams, however, have no varsity counterpart. These sports are often less conventional or more modern, like the year-old Quidditch team. Other teams simply more individualistic or less integrated into popular culture. These teams include sports like self-defense, Shotokan karate, ballroom dance and archery. However, despite their lack of widespread popularity, most club sports have found steady followings at Harvard.
Several club teams have also found incredible success: the ballroom team will be hosting their 20th Annual Harvard Invitational Ballroom Competition on April 23-24, and the Radcliff rugby team will be heading to nationals later this spring.
The Harvard men's ultimate frisbee team, Red Line, has proven to be one of the top teams in the nation so far this season, finishing in the top five at three elite national tournaments. After a tournament at UConn next weekend, the squad will prepare for the College Series in hopes of earning a berth to the National Championships, a competition held in Colorado in late May.
Despite the fact that they don’t get the recognition that the varsity competitors receive, you can bet that these Crimson athletes will be giving their all, whether it’s on the court, the field or the ballroom.

Sunday brunch, enjoyed by many Harvard students after long nights of debauchery, features many hearty breakfast staples, including scrambled eggs and made-to-order omelets. Although many students look forward to Sunday brunch all week, the  source of these eggs have recently come under scrutiny.
Most egg suppliers utilize battery-cage methods, where hens are confined to cages measuring only 67 square inches—less than the area of a single piece of paper. In 2007, HUHDS began substituting some eggs from battery-cage farms with cage-free eggs, but not all of them. In an effort to push Harvard to complete the switch to cage-free eggs, Marina N. Bolotnikova '14 is circulating a petition to raise awareness concerning the source of HUHDS' eggs. Bolotonikova said she's confident that her petition could have an impact in convincing HUHDS to utilize cage-free eggs.
"A switch to cage-free eggs right now seems a lot more appropriate than it did a few years ago" Bolotnikova said, citing concerns for animal welfare and the impact battery-cage farms have on the environment as motivation, along with recent victories of similar initiatives at Brandeis and Emerson. According to Bolotonikova, students have been very supportive of her petition, which she is circulating on behalf of the Massachusettes Humane Society. Currently the petition includes over 840 signatures, and she hopes to have 2,000 by the end of April.
Bolotnikova, who has met with HUHDS to discuss the possibility of a switch to cage-free eggs, said that HUHDS' main concerns are financial—a budget increase of an estimated $120,000 would be needed to fund the switch. Bolotnikova said the cost could be passed down to students, increasing tuition by approximately $18 dollars per student annually. Students could also sacrifice an existing menu item to fund the switch, but in either case, she said that the change is "well worth the money." Bolotonikova said that HUHDS is eager to become more environmentally friendly, but hesitant to raise prices.
"We are trying hard to make this a collaboration, rather than trying to antagonize HUHDS," Bolotonikova said.
Alexis A. Fox, the state director of the Humane Society of the United States, is working closely with Bolotonikova. "We are thrilled that dining services and the student body are working together to move the campus away from caged eggs," said Fox, who is also involved with efforts to pass House Bill 458, which would ban the use of battery-cages in Massachusetts.
Students who also feel that Harvard should move away from battery-cage methods are urged to lend their support by providing their e-signature on the "Cage-Free Harvard" petition.
"Student support is most important in bringing about this change," Bolotonikova said.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION:
 The March 27 article "Freshman Leads Petition for Cage-Free Eggs" misidentified Alexis A. Fox. She is the state director of the Humane Society of the United States.

Adams House exchanged classy for country last Thursday night for the Outing Club's semi-annual square dance. Dancers, dressed in outfits ranging from flannel and cowboy hats to jeans and sweaters, assembled from 8:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. in the Adams dining hall to square dance with the live band, Nor'easter.
 
"If you're lost, laugh!" said Will R. Mentor, the caller or person in charge of annoucing dance moves during songs last night.
 
Dancers were quick to follow his advice, doing the dosado and working up a sweat with both friends and strangers.
 
"It's a great group of people here, and it's kind of a different thing to do on a weekend night," Helen E. Bradshaw '11 said. "I'm not very good but a lot of people aren't."
 
Band member Max A. Newman '07 explained that the square dancing tradition at Harvard began back in the 1940s and was extremely popular. Newman helped restart square dancing during his time as an undergraduate and was pleased to see the tradition continue.
 "It's a really different sort of event. Live music, live caller. It doesn't really matter if you dance," said Michael R. Traver '14, an Outing Club leader. "You just get out there and have fun."

ABC's "Wipeout" features contestants constantly getting knocked down by objects coming out of nowhere and having to jump on to huge rotating wheels. Sounds like the source for a few easy laughs, but what about actually competing on the show?
With a generous push from his little brothers, Rodrigo J. Plaza '14, competed and won.
"I started watching the show when I was about 16 years old," Plaza said. "I would always tell my two younger brothers how I could totally win it, but at that point, I wasn't old enough to even apply yet."
Last summer, when he finally turned 18, his youngest brother reminded him of his promise, and after filling out an online form, going in for an interview, and passing a physical, Plaza was told that he had made it on to the show.
In typical Harvard spirit, Plaza figured he should be as prepared as possible. "When I was told that I had to get a physical done, I figured that probably meant I should start working out a bit," Plaza said. "I had a couple months to prepare before I actually went in for the first round, so I started working out a lot at the gym, and even swimming."
But once he got there, nothing could have prepared him for the tasks ahead. "There's really no secret to it. You have no idea what you're about to do, and what you're getting yourself into," Plaza said. "I guess it's all a matter of luck. And a big part of it, too, was perseverance. It was very tolling to constantly get knocked down, but I just had to push through it."
And pushing through is exactly what Plaza did. Making it through four rounds, Plaza won "Wipeout" and now has a freshly signed $50,000 check to boast.
What's he going to do with that great big check? "The only plan I've made so far is to travel to Europe this summer with my girlfriend," Plaza said. "Other than that, I guess we'll see!"
