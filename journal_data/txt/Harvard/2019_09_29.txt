Watching “Downton Abbey” is like being fed freshly baked cookies, petting a soft kitten, and snuggling into a warm bed — all at once. The film does not pretend to be anything else than what it is: an enjoyable two-hour peek into the usual trials and tribulations of the world’s favorite British upper class family and their loyal Yorkshire servants. It is fan service to devotees of writer and creator Julian Fellowes’ TV show in the best possible way, as the familiar actors deliver their signature quippy and sensible British remarks while each storyline gives its characters their diligence.
The film opens on 1927 Downton, about a year after the final season ended. The Crawley family are still as thick as thieves with Mary (Michelle Dockery) and her husband Henry (Matthew Goode), struggling (yet somehow managing) to run the estate with Tom Branson’s (Allen Leech) help. All three of them raise their children with the help of the Earl and Countess of Gratham, Robert (Hugh Bonneville) and Cora Crawley (Elizabeth McGovern). Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), now the Marchioness of Hexham, is showered with social engagements as her new role pulls her away from her old life running a newspaper. The Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) and Lady Merton — formerly known as Cousin Isobel (Penelope Wilton) — still live just nearby, quarrelling and having tea as usual. Downstairs, we see John (Brendan Coyle) and Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) raising their son, Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) still in command as head housekeeper, and a recently promoted Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier) doing a fine job as the family’s butler. The arrival of the King George (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James) in Downton puts everyone in a flurry. Compared to the Royals, the Crawleys are practically Cockney dirt, as outsiders are quick to point out to the loyal staff. When the Royals eventually arrive, the servants are horrified and disappointed to learn that there is a hierarchy even within the servant life: None of them will have the honor of serving the King and Queen, as they have brought their own staff.
Fellowes has continued to craft his signature interlocking storylines, which translate quite easily to movie form. The conflicts, like those on the show, are never too dangerous. The staff must deal with the broken down water pump, Lady Edith’s husband is called away on tour, and Mary struggles with the arrival of the King and Queen. The Dowager Countess plots to return Robert’s fortune after a family spat, and Isobel is not far behind to simultaneously help and hinder her. Though Fellowes engages with some darker issues, continuing to delve into class warfare through Daisy’s hesitation to marry and hedging questions about continuing work at Downton (Sophie McShera), the viewer is always in a benevolent universe where everything will always turn out just right. Just like in the show, these non-problems still sustain any drama-hungry viewer.
Of course, the triviality of these problems spurs the show’s signature jocular dialogue. The viewer might side with the Dowager Countess in one moment, but a particularly biting remark from Isobel forces the viewer to switch sides again. The pattern is familiar and yet it gracefully straddles the line between predictable and reassuring.
Having said this, some of the storylines seem a bit too repetitive or similar to the show — namely Daisy’s storyline. Faithful viewers of the show should be more than familiar with her skeptical ways, her lack of satisfaction with her life, and her inner turmoil about her romantic relationship. For the most part, her problems were resolved in the final season, yet they keep coming back. At least fans will have the satisfaction of seeing Tom finally meeting someone like him — both an aristocrat and an outsider in the form of Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton), a maid and companion to Crawley family member Lady Bagshaw. Mr. Carson, brought to life once more quite brilliantly by Jim Carter, gets one last hurrah as butler. Perhaps Thomas, who after six seasons of being hated by both fans and characters alike finally gets a chance at love, derives the most satisfaction of all the characters. Fellowes shows excellent sensitivity when treating the plight of a gay man in the 1920s. It is this, Thomas’s redemption and discovery of love, that is the light shining through the darkness which best encapsulates the film’s essence and the spirit of the lauded and beloved show.
Not much else can be said about the film beside the superb acting and resplendent costumes and extravagant scenes. Nothing about it disappoints. Maggie Smith and “Downton” newcomer Imelda Staunton put on particularly splendid performances as bickering cousins, but credit is due to all the actors who reprise their characters with gusto. While the Downton Abbey estate might be falling on hard times, the movie shows that it can always be dusted and brought right back to life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As visually stunning and character-driven as Scorsese’s best work, “The Irishman” is destined for an enduring legacy as not only one of the best films of 2019, but an indelible masterpiece amongst all crime cinema classics. As the opener for the New York Film Festival, the world premiere for “The Irishman” was met with a standing ovation and a curtain call for the legendary director, who introduced his latest film in person, along with longstanding collaborator Robert De Niro and actors Al Pacino and Joe Pesci on September 27.
“The Irishman” marks Scorsese’s return to mobster films, and on its surface, his latest film may seem like a thinly veiled excuse to simply recycle his most popular crime genre work, in a similar vein to "Casino.” With a hefty 209 minute runtime and a whopping $159 million budget, it’s not surprising that several major studios turned down Scorsese’s behemoth of a project, aside from Netflix. But if “The Irishman” will teach filmgoers and studios anything, it will be to never doubt Martin Scorsese.
While “The Irishman” delves into similar themes as Scorsese’s other crime films, it takes an undeniably more personal and mature approach, created with the care of a craftsman looking not to simply reminisce, but to build on his earlier works — this time, with the weight of experience. At the film's core is a compelling story about loyalty, family, a tragic hero, and a rumination on what it means to have a legacy.
The film follows Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in his rise up the ranks of the criminal underworld, his friendship with famed labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and his faltering relationship with his children. It stretches across numerous decades, often bounding backwards and forwards years at a time — a feat made possible with new de-aging technology. Clearly, Netflix’s $159 million was put to good use, as the characters look different enough from year to year, but unmistakably recognizable all the same.
The central friendship between Hoffa and Sheeran drives most of the film’s compelling narrative. It may seem difficult to empathize characters who essentially steal, plunder, and murder for a living, but Scorsese has never had a problem humanizing his mobster characters with deep-rooted universal desires. Hoffa is driven by pride, which in turn fuels his desire to build a legacy. Sheeran is locked in a mental struggle between whether to honor a new friendship or "show appreciation" to the mobsters who helped mold him.
Both characters are played spectacularly — and perhaps surprisingly — by veterans Pacino (“The Godfather” and “Scarface”) and De Niro (“Taxi Driver” and “The Godfather: Part II”). It’s easily both of their most respectable characters in decades, as De Niro has taken up questionable roles in infamous movies of late, including the cartoon shark gangster parody “Shark Tale,” and “Dirty Grandpa.” Pacino has arguably fared worse, with his filmography including the nightmare-inducing “Jack and Jill.” But in “The Irishman," the Al Pacino that graces the screen isn’t the one who picked up a paycheck from an Adam Sandler "comedy"; he walks a careful line between affable charisma with impetuous emotional outbreaks, managing audience expectations of his fate (Hoffa famously disappeared in 1975) while staying relatable. De Niro plays a conflicted man lost for place (at home, at work, and with his friendships), and in a heartbreaking sequence, tries to keep his emotions in check in what is supposed to be an emotionless business.
Joe Pesci (“Raging Bull,” “Goodfellas,” and “Casino”) returned from retirement to join Scorsese’s reunion project, which also includes Harvey Keitel ("Mean Streets") in what surmounts to an extended cameo appearance. No longer the hotheaded, aggressive, mobster who flies into temper tantrums, Pesci now plays the measured and calculating crime boss Russell Bufalino. Pesci's transformation an exercise in intertextuality that references Scorsese’s message of that legacies change with age.
It’s worth noting that the film’s denouement has potential to lose steam with general audiences. It feels anticlimactic after the gloriously bloody mobster violence of the first two hours 45 minutes, but it’s also important to see that this was the direction Scorsese seemed to have set up from the beginning, and he takes his time tying up loose character threads. The film's concluding sequence reminds one of “Raging Bull” — where the Bronx Bull has lost his propensity as a fighter, retiring from professional boxing, but the film continues to follow his downfall long afterwards. It’s a tribute to what it means to have a legacy and, in hindsight, makes the choices that characters make throughout the film much more poignant.
Martin Scorsese is arguably the greatest filmmaker of all time. Perhaps Spielberg has made the most beloved blockbusters (such as "Jaws" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark"). Perhaps Coppola has made the most iconic series with "The Godfather.” Perhaps relative newcomers like Tarantino or Nolan have potential. But “The Irishman” cements Scorsese’s greatest strength as a director: his tenacity. Scorsese has now made films for over 50 years, from classics like “Taxi Driver” in 1976 and “Raging Bull” in 1980, to “Goodfellas” in 1990. The fact that “The Irishman” can more than hold its own against the director’s earlier, universally acclaimed classics from a bygone era of cinema is a testament to Scorsese’s ability to continuously adapt as a director — even when he’s already at the top of his game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 30, 2019 at 1:23 a.m.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow apologized Saturday for using the 13th Amendment as an analogy to compare the University’s wealthy donors to slaves at a Tuesday meeting.
The comment — made at an Alumni Affairs and Development staff meeting in Sanders Theatre — upset some of the hundreds of staff members in attendance, according to the Boston Globe, which first reported the story. An anonymous staff member called the remarks “tone-deaf” in an interview with the Globe.
Bacow used the 13th Amendment to explain that just as people cannot own slaves, Harvard's 12 individual schools cannot "own" their alumni and limit their donations to other schools, according to the Globe. Such practices could be detrimental to fundraising efforts by schools with alumni who tend to find jobs in the non-profit or public sector and may subsequently be less wealthy.
Bacow later sent an email to staff Saturday morning stating that he did not intend to offend anyone with his remarks.
“I regret that these comments caused offense. That certainly was not my intent,” Bacow wrote. “I hoped to convey my belief that our collective job is to help our donors achieve their philanthropic objectives, which might include supporting activities in schools where they enjoyed no prior affiliation.”
Natalie Kopp, an international development officer at the School of Public Health who attended the meeting, wrote in an email that the context of Bacow’s comments was a question about collaboration and respect for individuals in the alumni community, but that his analogy was “unfortunate.”
“I think his comparison to slavery was unfortunate and was an off the cuff remark in response to a question from the audience but the spirit of his message was very clear,” Kopp wrote. “I understand why the messaging was concerning but I also appreciate him acknowledging those concerns and his promise to learn from this experience.”
Kopp also noted that at Harvard and other institutions, fundraisers often refer to donors as “my donor,” which she views to be a “harmful” practice.
“When we regularly use phrases like ‘my donor’ behind closed doors, we are falsely claiming ‘ownership’ and control over alumni and benefactors we care deeply about and who care about Harvard,” Kopp wrote. “Our role as fundraisers is to be a philanthropic guide and advisor, not to persuade alumni to give only to their affiliated schools.”
Bacow’s comments were in response to a question about One Harvard — a concept former University President Drew G. Faust adopted as part of the University-wide fundraising effort known as “The Harvard Campaign” — reported the Globe.
Bacow closed his email by saying that he plans to learn from this moment.
“People, appropriately, have high expectations for their leaders and their choice of language,” Bacow wrote. “In fact, you have high expectations for me as your president. I promise to learn from this experience. I do not want to disappoint you as I did some of you during our meeting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Let the games begin.” — Bane, The Dark Knight Rises
While Brown might be the team that gains the most from an exploding playing surface, as anything that deviates from the game of football helps their cause, this is not the reason I chose Bane’s quote from the clearly second-best of Nolan’s Batman films to open this column. Yes, the Ivy League football teams opened up play last week against non-conference opponents. Yes, those were official games that are in the final, overall standings. No, they do not affect the Ancient Eight winner whatsoever.
This week, four teams finally play games that will determine the conference champion, with Harvard and Yale each hosting Ivy League foes. Since I feel that I snubbed the best movie of the trilogy in the first paragraph, I will make sure to devote the rest of the article to The Dark Knight, especially with the possibility that the new Joker movie coming out next weekend doesn’t hold up. I have faith, though. Excited for October.
CORNELL VS. YALE
“If you’re good at something, never do it for free.” — Joker
Yale athletics definitely understand this principle better than Gotham’s gangsters and thugs, judging by its central involvement in the recent college admissions scandal. Kudos to being the only Ancient Eight school, which are barred from granting athletic scholarships, to spin the cash flow in the other direction.
The football team, however, did not violate a single NCAA rule. The Bulldog squad that trots out Saturday will be a completely legal opening to Yale and Cornell’s Ivy League debut. Even Harvey Dent has no dirt on a squad that somehow retained 21 of 22 starters from last year’s team. Should help them out.
Yale by 10
GEORGETOWN VS. COLUMBIA
“You complete me.” — Joker, to Batman
Fun fact: Columbia and Georgetown have a dual degree program between their engineering schools, despite the fact that they are approximately four hours away. You spend three years in the nation’s capital and two in the Big Apple and end up with an A.B. from Georgetown College and a B.S. from Columbia University. Hopefully this weekend’s game doesn’t jeopardize the engineering schools’ relationship. If Vegas is correct, the Gotham Knights shouldn’t have much trouble with the Hoyas.
Columbia by 14.
PRINCETON VS. BUCKNELL
“It’s simple. We kill the Batman.” “If it’s so simple, why haven’t you done it yet?” — Joker and Maroni
The Ancient Eight is so exciting because any team can beat any other team in any given week. For Princeton, however, this doesn’t seem to hold true, as the Tigers haven’t been defeated since 2017. Last week, I favored Princeton by 35 points. They went out and won by 42. It’s gonna take a lot to stop this juggernaut. Even the National Guard couldn’t stop Bane, and that was only the second-best Nolan Batman villain, including Liam Neeson. Bucknell is no Batman.
Princeton by 28
PENN VS. LAFAYETTE
“Madness, as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push.” — Joker
Nobody understands this quick descent into madness better than the University of Pennsylvania Dean of Undergraduate Admissions. Eric Furda, who’s been in the position since 2008, was filmed during the recent Eagles-Lions game voicing his profane frustrations with the Eagles. To be clear, I am in no way criticizing Dean Furda. If I were an Eagles fan this year, I would react similarly. In fact, he seems abnormally sane to me. Luckily for Furda and others, the Quakers are not the Eagles.
Penn by 14
COLGATE VS. DARTMOUTH
“This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.” — Joker
Over the past two seasons, the Big Green Defensive Machine™ (eventually it’ll catch on) has looked like an immovable object. Last week Dartmouth kept Jacksonville in the single digits, allowing only six points. Crimson style mandates that I must write out the text for any number under 10. The way Dartmouth has been playing, my ATIs are going to turn into arthritis.
No one ever goes to Hanover (at least by choice). But for the very few who do, you rarely leave with a lot of points under your belt. Same goes for Colgate.
Dartmouth by 17
HARVARD VS. BROWN
“You know what I’ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go according to plan.” — Joker
It would very much be according to plan for Harvard to defeat Brown this week. The first game of the week is under Friday Night Lights, and the Crimson haven’t needed Coach Taylor’s inspiration to dominate the Bears in recent matchups.
“Everyone loses their minds! Introduce a little anarchy.” — Joker
Brown would definitely have to produce at least a bit of Ancient Eight anarchy this week to upend Harvard. The Bears squeaked by Bryant and will be looking for its first Ivy League win since 2016. It hasn’t topped the Crimson since 2011, getting used to losing its sharpied-in second game of the year.
“Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos.” — Joker
For a conference whose academic institutions represent the very idea of established order in higher education, everything often truly does become chaos. Maybe Brown has more of a chance than everyone is giving them, and maybe the Bears’ first game is a sign of true success to come.
“Let’s not blow things out of proportion.” — Joker
