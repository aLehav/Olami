After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Square Business Association honored Sheldon Cohen, a man known for more than six decades as the “unofficial mayor of Harvard Square,” at a storytelling celebration on Tuesday night.
Approximately 60 community members, including business owners and Cambridge officials, gathered at The Atrium on Church Street to reminisce about Cohen, who founded the iconic Out of Town News kiosk that sits on the central island in Harvard Square.
“Nothing says Harvard Square business more than Sheldon Cohen,” said Denise Jillson, executive director of the HSBA.
“It was such an emotional situation, especially when you’ve spent six decades here,” Cohen said. “Listening to people’s stories—words can’t express.”
Carl F. Barron, former owner of Putnam Furniture in Central Square, remembered the early days of Cohen’s career in his story. For nearly ten years, Cohen and his father hawked newspapers together in front of the Harvard Square MBTA station.
“He was the loudest voice in Harvard Square and could be heard from one end to the other selling those newspapers,” Barron said.
After Cohen’s father died, Cohen continued the family business. He founded Out of Town News, Inc., in 1955. Cohen sold the business to Hudson News in 1994. It is currently operated by Muckey’s Corp.
Cohen also operated Out of Town Tickets, which he recently sold to Ace Tickets. He has been looking to sell his last business, Community Mapping, Inc., since he announced his retirement last November.
Over the years, Out of Town News has become a Cambridge institution.
For many a Cantabrigian—including Anthony D. Galluccio, a former Massachusetts state senator and Cambridge mayor—hawking newspapers at Out of Town was a first job and a welcome opportunity to earn a little pocket money.
“As a hawker, it was one of the most exciting times of my life,” Galluccio said.
Cohen’s trove of historical knowledge and his generosity were also mentioned by attendees as they dined on a meal of chicken soup and spaghetti and meatballs.
“He [influenced] so many people,” said Cambridge Postmaster Kathy Lydon. “My boss gave me a list of things to do when I started, but [Cohen] taught me the history.”
Kelly Thompson Clark, president and CEO of the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce, called Cohen a “guiding light in the business community.”
Daniel O’Neill, community relations director of the Cambridge division of The Salvation Army, recalled that Cohen often donated Red Sox and Patriots tickets to the charitable organization.
The evening ended with a story from Cohen himself, thanking each of the guests for their words.
Cohen, a resident of Jamaica Plain, said he plans to remain involved in the Harvard Square community.
“Now I’m thinking ‘What does Harvard Square need?’ I want the community and future students to understand the Square and the value of it,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard  athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program  history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
 
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
 
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve  selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest  will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
 
Earlier today we took a look at Winters v. Gibbons. Now, we focus our attention on the final first-round matchup on the men's side: squash's Gary Power against lightweight rower Andrew Campbell.
Gary Power – 13-6 record overall, 10-5 record as Harvard No. 1 (2010-11 season)
At the conclusion of his freshman season, sophomore Gary Power finished seventh in the Dunlop men’s college squash individual rankings. Though Power served as his team’s top seed for most of the season and thus faced opponents’ toughest players each contest, the then-freshman boasted a.684 winning percentage in 2010-11, matched only by fellow freshmen Nigel Koh and Thomas Mullaney. Power’s performance helped power his squad to fifth in the country.
The rookie had some big wins in his first season, including a Feb. 9 victory over Trinity's top player, Parth Sharma. Sharma was 12-0 on the year coming into the match.
Power received a first-team All-American selection for his play, making him one of five non-Trinity players to win the distinction. He has also had a strong start to his sophomore campaign, posting a 3-1 record before entering Ivy League play.
Andrew Campbell – Fourth Place at World Rowing Championships, USRowing Man of the Year
 
Harvard has many talented athletes, but only one is in the top five in the world. His name is Andrew Campbell.
The 19-year-old, who was named USRowing Man of the Year, took fourth place in the lightweight single at the World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia, the highest U.S. finish in the event since 2002. Earlier that summer, he took bronze in the lightweight single at the U23 World Championships, giving him the top U.S. finish in the event ever.
On the national scene, meanwhile, it's been Campbell and then everyone else. The sophomore won the US U23 World Championship Trials by over 30 seconds and then won Elite Nationals three days later. This fall, he won the USRowing East Coast Fall Speed Order by over 10 seconds, while posting a time that only one heavyweight rower, Michael Sevigny, was able to beat.
Campbell is currently taking the semester off from Harvard in order to train with doubles partner Will Daly, a 2006 graduate of Boston University, with the goal of representing the United States in the lightweight double event at this summer's London Olympics.

Yesterday we finished off the first round on the men’s side of the bracket. Today we turn to the women, as skier Rebecca Nadler squares off against squash’s Laura Gemmell. Check back next week when the winners of each matchup will be revealed.
 
Rebecca Nadler – 21st-place finish at the World University Games
In only her first season of collegiate racing, Rebecca Nadler did things no Harvard alpine skier had done before. Nadler posted fourth- and sixth-place finishes in her first two college carnivals—the highest ever by a Crimson alpine skier—and followed those up with a 21st-place finish at the World University Games while representing Team Canada. While injuries and illnesses hampered her for the remainder of the Carnival season, Nadler was able to rally in time for the NCAA Championships, where she took 20th in the slalom.
A lifelong skier, Nadler took two years between high school and college to focus on her sport. In the first, she trained with the Quebec provincial team in hopes of making the national team. She spent the following year at the Carrabassett Valley Academy and was the 2009-10 Eastern Cup Champion.
Laura Gemmell – 16-1 record overall, 12-0 record as Harvard No. 1 (2010-11 season)
Harvard’s No. 1 entered the 2011 season coming off an undefeated rookie season that earned her a CSA Individual National Championship and Harvard the CSA Team National Championship. And the Eliot House resident began her sophomore season in similar form, going 12-0 in regular season play.
But Gemmell and the Crimson weren’t able to conjure the same postseason perfection they had the year before. Despite Gemmell winning all three of her matches at the CSA Championships, Harvard fell 5-4 to No. 1 Yale in the finals. Two weeks later, after advancing to the CSA Individual Final for the second consecutive season, Gemmell lost her first collegiate match at the hands of Yale’s Millie Tomlinson. Despite the loss, Gemmell was voted Ivy League Player of the Year, earned All-American recognition, and was honored as an Academic All-Ivy.
