After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The issue of illegal immigration has never been a simple one, nor has the problem been particularly well served by heavy-handed policy. But this is precisely the type of action that the Obama administration has espoused by forcing model employer American Apparel to dismiss 1,800 unauthorized workers. Such a move is tremendously shortsighted and does not represent a refined and intelligent policy, but rather a Band-Aid fix to a problem that needed a suture a long time ago.
In a time when the unemployment rate is flirting with double digits and policy regarding unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. is nebulous at best, this move by the administration seems particularly out of place. Firing these 1,800 workers does not address the issue: There are 11.9 million workers whose deportment would simply be a waste of government resources and whose residency in the United States is impossible to ignore. Coercing companies into firing workers can only lead to a state of paralysis for unauthorized workers in the U.S., a state of residency in which they are neither acknowledged by the government nor given the chance to obtain meaningful employment in order to sustain their families, many of which include natural-born U.S. children who are harmed by poor immigration policy.
This policy cannot even be passed off as a benefit to lawful citizens of the United States. In fact, all evidence points to the contrary. Unemployment has been linked strongly to crime, and perpetual unemployment in the immigrant community does nothing to solve this problem, but rather aggravates it to the detriment of all society.
There is, of course, a systemic problem with illegal immigration to the United States. However, policies like firing workers who are trying to make an honest living in America puts the cart before the horse and politics before people. There are fundamental weaknesses in our immigration policy that need to be dealt with in advance of heavy-handed initiatives to punish violators of federal laws. Immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border has experienced a slight dip but still occurs at a considerable level. We still have not decided as a nation how we are going to solve the issue of assimilating immigrants into the U.S. in a matter that is equitable and ensures that every beneficiary and resident of the United States is accounted for and documented properly.
Firing unauthorized workers is therefore premature and not part of a holistic approach to comprehensive immigration reform, but rather an exclusionary targeting of a demographic and a hollow indictment of employing unauthorized workers. If the Obama administration sincerely wants to solve the immigration issue once and for all, it must dispense with bad policy, not decent people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, just a week after radio and television host Glenn Beck’s 9/12 rally, the special interest group Family Research Council hosted what was essentially the second Republican convention of the month: the annual Values Voters Summit. Many speakers delivered offensive comments; particularly disturbing was youth leader Jason Mattera’s chauvinistic speech about the “hotness of Republican women.” But for the most part, speakers took care not to throw civility overboard with the tea.
More unsettling to this young writer was the dismissive tone of the Democrats’ official response to keynote speaker and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty’s speech. After Governor Pawlenty delivered a two-part sermon to the choir on the perils of health-care reform and the importance of retaining certain traditional Judeo-Christian morals, Democratic National Committee spokesman Hari Sevugan offered the following statement: “It looks like Tim Pawlenty isn’t even going to offer the pretense of being anything but an extreme right-wing radical anymore. At least it’s honest, and if you’ve seen what he’s said on health care lately, you know that’s a rare feat.”
Although Shevugan may be accurate regarding Pawlenty’s political stance, he chose an inappropriate tone for a discussion on “American values.” The response relegated a popular governor’s opinions to the wilderness of unworthy words and offered no counterpoints to Pawlenty’s take on the country’s moral path.
Sadly, Sevugan’s response is indicative of an all-too-present problem with the Democratic Party: It often dismisses talk of “values” and popular concerns with cultural breakdown. For far too long, Democrats have shunned moral language and allowed Republicans to dominate the conversation. We should stop. It is both politically unwise and undemocratic to simply disregard the deepest beliefs of any part of the American citizenry.
On September 18, liberal pundit Rachel Maddow hosted a segment on her show entitled “Should Politicians Value Values Voters?” The answer to that question should be a resounding “yes.” A recent Gallup Poll found that the majority of Americans believe the government should promote “traditional values.” Astoundingly enough, last year’s same poll marked the high point for opposition to government that promotes traditional values since Gallup started asking the question in 1993. Democrats may hold power in Washington, but it seems the country is becoming less—rather than more—socially liberal. Over the past year, more and more Americans appear to be—in the most important sense of the word—values voters.
If only for this reason and this reason only, Democrats should take care not to dismiss, ignore, or lampoon speeches about morals. Although the FRC may not represent the set of traditional values the majority of Americans wish the government to promote, it does not bode well for Democrats to dismiss their points of view as extremist. This only serves to promote the image of the party platform as a mere checklist of economic reforms—an image that has lost us more than one election in the past.
But even beyond concerns of electoral strategy, the Democratic Party would do well to change how it approaches the American values debate. Instead of pretending to operate in a moral vacuum, liberals in the United States must offer a vision of American values to contrast that of folks like Tim Pawlenty. President Obama has tried to do this for some time, but many of his supporters—especially young progressives—refuse to follow suit.
In “The Audacity of Hope,” President Obama writes that “…values—the standards and principles that the majority of Americans deem important in their lives, and in the life of the country—should be at the heart of our politics.” Remembering these words, it’s disturbing not only to hear the offhanded response of the DNC spokesperson, but also to read the comments on the Daily Kos advocating a value-free politics and listen to students talk about crazy wingnuts’ morality.
No citizen, politician, or party should run away from a debate on American values. We would all do well to remember that it is just as bad for Democrats to bleach away discussion of values as it is for their Republican counterparts to talk traditional morals in order to fearmonger. Americans navigate the world with a moral compass, and at the end of the day, ignoring public conversation about shared values could set our shared journey off course.

All of a sudden, American Apparel’s popular “Legalize LA” shirts have taken on a whole new significance. In the coming days, the company will fire 1,800 workers whose papers federal authorities deemed illegitimate. Though it is always a tragedy whenever anyone loses his or her job, the criticism over this new policy of firing is unwarranted.
Estimates show that from 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants currently reside in the United States. Though President Obama favors making all current immigrants legal, there still exists a need to stop further illegal immigration and create policies to deal with the illegal immigrants who are currently in the United States in the meantime. Holding all employers accountable for their employees’ legal status is a step in the right direction.
In August, 9.6 percent of the United States labor force was unemployed. If there is ever a good time to fire illegal immigrants, it is during a recession when citizens and documented immigrants are in need of jobs and able to fill any gaps left by undocumented immigrants. In this sense, the Obama administration’s plan will at least benefit Americans who are currently searching for work due to the recession. Although the expertise that many illegal immigrants have acquired during the tenure of their employment cannot immediately be transferred to their legal replacements, many of the jobs affected—such as those in the American Apparel factory—involve skills that can easily be taught.
Some argue that the government should target sweatshops instead of a company like American Apparel, which pays high wages and touts its humane working conditions. But, in July, Homeland Security released a list of 652 companies that it would be auditing. To make an exception for American Apparel would be to deliberately not enforce a law and would send the wrong message to the other firms on the list. Now, all companies throughout the United States understand that the government will hold them responsible for hiring workers with proper documentation, rather than illegal immigrants.
The Obama policy of focusing on firing, not raids that would result in deportation, is a notable improvement over the Bush administration’s approach. Though economically damaging, at least the firings allow illegal immigrants to stay in the United States rather than being sent home as they would have been under the old regime.
If Obama is truly in favor of controlling our borders and curbing illegal immigration, then it is necessary to make it less appealing to disregard the law and sneak into the United States. By sending the clear message that illegal immigrants will not be hired—as well as convincing employers that they cannot retain illegal employees—other measures such as border security will be more meaningful and effective.
Though it is natural to be sympathetic to the plight of illegal immigrants, one must remember that they are illegal, and hiring them is illegal as well. If the laws are on the books, they should be enforced. As a company that takes justifiable pride in all of its clothes being made in the USA, American Apparel should now be proud that all of its workers will be legal in the USA as well.

Nobody reads anymore. It’s not that we’re illiterate. We’re just un-booked.
Someone in the business recently estimated that there are only 80,000 reliable buyers of serious fiction left in North America. And that was before we lost Michael Jackson. Every year, someone comes out with a study explaining that boys don’t read because, in books, the proportion of car chases to women talking about their feelings tends to be somewhat tilted in favor of the latter. But what’s the excuse for us women?
Maybe we are confused about what a book is. Accustomed to asking the Internet all our life questions, like “Do you recommend this restaurant?” and “What is a ‘bailiwick’?,” we now turn to it for our reading material as well. But this habit can be deadly. As I type this, there are thousands, if not millions, of people reading something called fanfiction—which is what you come across when you search for literature online but are unclear on how to spell the book title. The two are similar, except that where literature usually has things like grammar and themes, fanfiction has things like exclamation points and other exclamation points. You can see how these misunderstandings occur. It’s easy to imagine some poor soul searching the internet for “The Great Gatsby” and finding “The GREAT!!!! GATSBY: My Ending.” “This must be literature,” I can imagine him thinking. “What gives it away is its enthusiasm for its subject matter.”
And if you thought this was the exception, dreaming instead that the Internet could be a great bastion of hope for readers to share their thoughts, think again. On GoodReads.com, someone named Brad has this insight to share: “The Great Gatsby: This book becomes far better when you take all of Gatsby’s mystery and just think of him as Batman.”
As a writer, I find this troubling.
Why aren’t we reading? It’s not that television has gotten more interesting. Or that we have. If anything, we are less interesting than we have ever been before. The other day I spent two hours staring at a wall. This in itself does not indicate that I’m boring, except that I try to tell it as an anecdote at parties. (“Have I told you the wall story?” I ask.)
Reading, unfortunately, demands your full attention. Back in the halcyon days before the Internet, books only had to contend with homework, sports, and television, so it stood a chance at getting some of that mental space. But the shift was taking place, even among people who wound up at Harvard. The thought, “If I’d had cable in my childhood, I’d be able to relate to people better,” crosses my mind several times per day, as my friends debate the minutiae of vintage Nickelodeon shows. These are all people who, if given a book and an ultimatum, would produce an insightful paper on it. But read one? Recreationally? That’s so 1890s.
The reason these new technologies get the jump on reading: You can do them while you’re doing other things. Our generation likes the sound of that. We were born multitasking. Now, we jog along with our iPods and watch online television while we Gchat. But reading is a different matter. I know from personal experience that it is extremely difficult to read while you work out, especially on a Stairmaster.
Pleasure reading has long been an American ideal—generations of schoolchildren have headed home for the summer toting recreational reading lists. But try to pitch it to a group of non-readers and they quickly become suspicious. “This is a book,” you explain. “It’s like a textbook, but enjoyable, and you don’t have to take notes in the margins. You can, of course. William Blake wrote a lot of marginalia in all his books. But, then again, he didn’t bathe very often.” At this point you realize that you are rambling and have to start over. “This is a book,” you say, holding up the rectangular, clothbound object and shaking it at them. “Go sit somewhere quiet by yourself and read it.” They look at you. “It’s not antisocial!” you find yourself shouting. “You have to do it by yourself, but you can talk about it afterward! Oprah does it! Monthly!”
But that may be the rub. For reading is anti-social, and it does require focus. If there are two words that accurately describe our generation, those words are “social” and “unfocused.” And this is a shame. Books are wonderful. They are like people, except they mind less when you put them down and wander off to eat something. A character in a book by Proust once noted that, if you could subscribe to receive a page or two of a great book instead of a newspaper at breakfast every day, everyone would be better off. If only Proust were on Twitter. Instead, we hang with bated breath on the every tweet of people like Al Gore and Miley Cyrus (“Thank you Salt Lake for being so amazing and supportive.”) Sometimes, you just want to get away from it all, to immerse yourself in the words of someone who actually does know more than you do, to sit down somewhere peaceful and think something exciting. Sometimes, you just want to read a book. And for times like that, there’s nothing like a book.

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono: At least after his speech at Harvard this week, he’ll finally be able to say that some Americans have actually heard of him.
White House Interns: The Washington Post caught two White House interns sparring light saber-style in a bout of swordplay reminiscent of Jedi Master Obama. It may have cast some doubt in Washington over their maturity, but we find this the most badass thing ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the morning of June 28, Rodolfo F. Pastor began an unexpected journey to Harvard. As Honduran Minister of Culture, he suddenly found himself threatened, entangled in a military coup against his elected government.
Coup leaders had sought out his colleagues in the ministry, and Pastor feared for his safety. To avoid persecution by the new regime, Pastor went into hiding at a family cabin deep in the Honduran mountainside.
It was there that Pastor, who is also a renowned Latin American scholar, received a call from a longtime friend in Cambridge, Mass.
Harvard Anthropology Professor William Fash had read a contentious quotation in El Tiempo, a Honduran newspaper, criticizing the de facto government and worried that his friend might be in danger.
“It occurred to me that there was a safety factor,” Fash said.
He soon assembled a team which, by July, had secured Pastor a post as a visiting professor in Harvard’s History Department.
Since then, the University post has provided Pastor a means of maintaining a strong connection with Honduras, but from a safe distance behind Ivy-clad walls.
A HEART IN HONDURAS
Buried in the depths of Robinson Hall, Pastor’s new office is bare. No books sit on the shelves, no pictures hang on the walls. His office decor seems to suggest that he won’t be staying for long, that his worries lie elsewhere.
A few minutes into an interview with The Crimson, Pastor’s phone rings, and he immediately jumps to answer. It is his son on the line, calling from Washington D.C, where he serves as a diplomat on behalf of the Honduran government.
Technically, his son is unemployed—he is a diplomat for what Pastor calls “our” government: the administration ousted in June. But because the United States does not recognize the regime that took over in the coup, Pastor’s son has retained his title. Likewise, Pastor still considers himself Minster of Culture, Art, and Sports.
Reverting to Spanish, Pastor speaks on the phone for a few minutes and then hangs up, happy. But he deflects inquiries about the conversation, explaining that because the situation in Honduras is so precarious, anything made public could potentially change the course of events.
“We have news by the hour,” he says. “I can’t tell you much more about Honduras’ future. We get often hopeful about avenues for the future and then get frustrated, so I refuse to speculate.”
In the fourth poorest country in Latin America, Honduras’ pre-coup government had been seeking support for a national referendum that, if held and supported, would have dramatically changed the fabric of the government, a move those in the coup did not want to succeed.
The past months have been tenuous. In mid-August, Pastor flew to the United States, and has been in Cambridge since, safe from the turbulence of his home country. Bur his wife and youngest son are still in Honduras. Pastor’s wife could have joined him at Harvard, but he says her job in Honduras as an anthropologist and museum director prompted her to stay.
Though she is not under direct threat, family and friends of other ministers have been arrested and attacked. “I feel insecure about it,” Pastor says of his family’s decision to stay, “but if they want to reject my invitations or my exhortations that they go away from Honduras I have to respect their decision.”
A NEW RECRUIT
The switch from politician to professor was not without precedent for Pastor, who had previously taught at El Colegio de Mexico, the University of Pennsylvania, Haverford College, and the University of Chicago, and served as a lecturer at Harvard. Though his post in Honduras is a political one, it is a political post for which he is academically trained.
A Tulane University graduate, Pastor received his Ph.D. in history from the prestigious El Colegio de Mexico.
This semester, Pastor is teaching two undergraduate courses, Central American and Mexican (or Mesoamerican) Peoples: 1500-1840, and a freshman seminar, titled Alternative Narratives: An Introductory Seminar on the Modern Literature and Historiography of Latin America.
It took a team, led by Fash, to open Harvard’s doors for Pastor. Scholars at Risk, a nationwide initiative that finds posts for academics who find themselves persecuted and thus unable to pursue their academic work had already hired its faculty for the fall semester. Undeterred, Fash sought a network of support within the Faculty of Arts and Science to gather the resources to find Pastor a position at Harvard.
“The University really took it on the chin this past year so the question became, ‘how are we going to fund this?’ Because you don’t just find 25,000 dollars lying around,” Fash said.
By the end of July, just a month later, Scholars at Risk had partnered with the Peabody Museum, the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, the Freshmen Seminar Program and the History department to offer Pastor the position of visiting professor.
“It was really very heartening that so many concerned citizens could act in such a conjoined and conscientious way,” Fash said. “It’s wonderful that Harvard can rise to the occasion even in our own fiscal crisis.”
FUTURE
While he doesn’t speculate about the nation’s political future, Pastor is a strong critic of the new government. And on his replacement in the new cabinet, he offers what he describes as an old Latin American proverb: “If you can’t say anything positive, you better not talk,” he says.
But Pastor has not shied away from speaking more generally. On Wednesday, the history professor gave a lecture for the Rockefeller Center titled “The Short Story of the Coup.”
“We are living a national tragedy,” he said in the lecture, a week after the ousted president secretly returned to Honduras only to set up camp in a Brazilian embassy.
Though Honduras is currently struggling, Pastor says he still cares about his homeland and what he preserved as a minister of culture. “I believe cultural heritage sights are essential to understanding identity, which is supposedly what binds together a civilized nation,” he said. “I don’t understand how we could live without artistic expression.”
Pastor expects to take up a position at the Colegio de Mexico for the spring semester. Beyond that, his fate is linked with his nation’s. “I am—what is it you call it? A patriot.”

Amid growing controversy surrounding the decision to place brass bars in front of the books in the Dunster House library, House Masters Roger and Ann Porter have taken steps to defend their decision, citing security concerns and new information about the collection’s value.
When the Dunster House library opened Sunday for the first time this school year, residents discovered that their library’s collection had been rendered inaccessible, sparking a minor uproar on their House e-mail list, known as “Moose-droppings,” on Sunday and Monday.
Several students complained that bars would set an unacademic tone for the space, while others said that students should have been consulted in the decision. But the main worry appeared to be that students would no longer be able to access the books in the collection.
In an interview yesterday in the library, Ann Porter defended the decision and down-played the student reaction to the new security measure, striking the same chords she and co-Master Roger B. Porter had emphasized in a Wednesday e-mail to the House community. She added in the interview that students could still request books from the library and will now be able to access them 24 hours following a request, after library personnel have unscrewed the bars to remove the requested books.
The House moved to determine a way to protect the books after a visiting alum informed the House Masters this summer that there were some books in the collection that would be of some value, Porter said. She said she was unwilling to identify the alum out of concern for his or her privacy.
Some books have gone missing from the library over the years, Porter said.
“We noticed, occasionally, what looked like a gap in the books,” she said.
After consulting with officials in the University library system, several options were considered, including placing lockable sliding glass cases over the books, Porter said.
Students were not consulted in the process because it was made over the summer, she said.
Ultimately the Porters decided to go with the least expensive option, commissioning the placement of two rows of brass bars in front of each shelf of books, using already existing holes in the bookcase, she said.
Houses have had to trim costs after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences mandated a 25-percent cut in House budgets, which may have limited the House’s options when deciding how to safeguard the potentially valuable collection.
“It wasn’t our first choice,” Porter said.
She also said she wanted to find a way to maintain the library’s august character when selecting a means to ward off would-be thieves.
While Porter said she did not think many students regularly used the books, Sarah J. Johnson ’11, who sent an e-mail about the move over the House list, said she used the books regularly—particularly the reference books—instead of purchasing books for class.
She said the move goes against the nature of the University.
“My stance is the bars should come off,” she said.
Lorenzo Bartolucci ’11 called it a “sad day” when Dunster did not have enough money “to set up a proper library system.”
Former Dunster Undergraduate Council representative Matthew S. Garcia ’10 said he thinks the Porters’ recent e-mail to the house resolved the controversy.
“Most of it has been cleared up by now,” he said. “I don’t think people are really that upset about it.”
Both Dunster House Committee chairs declined to comment yesterday.
The Crimson broke the story of the new brass bars on its FlyBy Blog on Sunday.

CORRECTION APPENDED
The Harvard Voice is battling media accusations this week that it launched a targeted campaign to stalk “Harry Potter” actress Emma Watson at the Harvard-Brown football game last Friday—and the student publication is returning fire.
A New York Post article titled “Harvard Jerks Stalked Emma” reported yesterday that the Voice organized the harassment of Watson—a freshman at Brown University—with live blog updates throughout the night and actively tried to “draw as much attention to her as possible.”
But Alisha D. Ramos ’12, editor-in-chief of the Voice, called the piece an “outrageous” fabrication. On the Voice blog yesterday afternoon, Ramos denied accusations that the Voice planned to stalk Watson, emphasizing the purposefully “facetious” tone of the live updates and the happenstance nature of a blurry photograph of Watson leaving Harvard stadium that was posted on the blog the night of the game.
In an interview with The Crimson yesterday, Ramos said she stands behind the Voice’s reporting of Watson’s visit, noting that the heavy student interest in the actress necessitated coverage by a publication that focuses on student life.
“We meant absolutely no harm to Emma Watson...We were not actively pursuing her, nor were we orchestrating a mob of stalkers as Page Six put it.” Ramos said. “Our mission is really to report on things that Harvard students care about—and clearly this is something students are talking about.”
Emily X.L. Xie ’12, director of photography for the Voice, declined to reveal the identity of the staff photographer who snapped the picture, which was later posted on the Voice blog. But Xie stressed that “nobody was actually stalking Emma Watson.”
“The fact that we obtained the photo in the end was just as surprising to us and perhaps a bit hilarious as well,” Ramos said.
During the course of Friday’s football game, the Voice posted a series of live tweets that took a Watson-heavy turn around 7:42 p.m—more than two hours before the game began.
Subsequent posts included “EMMA IS HERE” and “WATSON FOUND. i [sic] repeat WATSON FOUND.” The posts—which were intended to parody the obsession surrounding Watson—were written by Voice staffers present at the game, according to Ramos.
The Voice’s evening concluded with a photograph of Watson, posted at 11:34 p.m., which intensified the anger of some concerned readers. “Emma is a person and does not deserve to be treated like a piece of meat,” one comment read.
An item in Page Six, the New York Post’s infamous gossip page, stated on Tuesday that Watson looked “quite shaken” at the game as security guards tried to protect her from stalkers. The information came from a tip e-mailed to Page Six, according to New York Post reporter Neel Shah.
After the publication of the brief, the Post received another e-mailed tip that directed the publication’s attention to the Voice’s reporting of Watson’s appearance at the game, according to Shah, who subsequently wrote the fleshed-out article.
Shah said that he tried to contact the editor-in-chief and e-mailed the general Voice account—but received no responses.
Ramos confirmed that she had seen Shah’s e-mailed inquiry but declined to comment.
“They had a chance to refute the story,” Shah said in an interview with The Crimson yesterday. “I don’t really see what gripe they could possibly have...What was I supposed to do? Drive up there and talk to them individually?”
One Brown student—who met Watson during orientation and has subsequently been on friendly terms with the actress—said that she was unaware of any controversy regarding Watson’s appearance at the football game until she had been contacted for this article.
The individual said Watson strives to keep a low-profile around campus, and the celebrity can often be seen surrounded by friends—not by the paparazzi.
“I think she went to the Harvard game because she wanted to be a normal Brown student,” said the individual, who requested not to be named to protect Watson’s privacy. “Understandably, it’s really not cool to be stalked...But I think there’s more speculation about what’s going on from the outside than there is from the inside.”
Mark Nickel, director of university communications at Brown, said he had no official comment regarding Watson’s visit to Cambridge and whether she had been stalked during the game.

CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Oct. 2 article "Harvard Voice Denies Hermione-Stalking Allegations" incorrectly stated that the Harvard Voice's blog posts about Emma Watson were written by Voice staffers not present at the Brown-Harvard football game on Sept. 25. In fact, the staffers writing the posts were present at the game, according to Voice editor-in-chief Alisha D. Ramos. The posts were put online with timestamps that indicated they were being posted three hours before gametime, but Ramos later clarified that the stamps were simply incorrect.

Overflowing trash cans, cardboard milk containers, Styrofoam bowls—a distressing sight for the environmentally-conscious, but for Aaron C. Fallon ’11 and Iris W. Tian ’11, this scene at Fly-By last fall marked an epiphany.
In search of a topic for their final project for Environmental Science and Public Policy 10: “Environmental Policy.” Fallon and Tian teamed up with classmate Phillip Y. Zhang ’12. Together, they sought to fix what Tian calls the most environmentally unfriendly component of Harvard University Dining Services: their grab-and-go lunch service.
Fallon, Tian, and Zhang sent their term paper to HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin, but with no guarantee that the University would act on any of their recommendations. Spring and summer passed with little word from HUDS.
But two weeks into the fall term, Martin sent the group an e-mail informing them that some of their report’s proposals had been implemented and inviting them to have a look. The report’s authors expect that the adopted proposals—which replace many non-recyclable, non-compostable goods with versions better for the environment—will reduce Fly-By’s trash levels by 90 percent and cut 29,353 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
‘HORRIBLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT’
Created in 1998, Fly-By is an upperclassmen-only self-service lunch program that serves an average of 550 people per day in Loker Commons, according to Martin. HUDS Executive Director Ted A. Mayer says he designed Fly-By to help students who were having difficulty getting lunch because of their schedules or the location of their Houses.
“It was really neat to have a grab-and-go solution, a very basic bag meal of a sandwich, fruit, chips, and a drink,” Martin says. “It’s evolved a lot over time.”
Over the years, HUDS even expanded Fly-By to include hot entrees. But the burgeoning lunch line was serving up more than just food. In their report, Fallon, Tian, and Zhang estimate that of Harvard’s annual greenhouse gas emissions produced by solid waste, 1.4 percent—32,614.4 pounds of carbon dioxide—came from Fly-By last year.
“None of the materials with which Fly-By food is served are recyclable or compostable,” they write in their report. “Even if students take their Fly-By lunch to go as they should, their waste will head directly to landfills.”
They trace the problem to several non-recyclable, non-compostable components of Fly-By: the plastic wrap on sandwiches, the cups and lids that were used for drinks and soups, and the Styrofoam containers used for entrees.
Tian is perhaps the most outspoken of the report’s authors. The only Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrator of the three, she avoids Fly-By because of environmental concerns and still makes time to return to Currier House for lunch in between classes.
“To some degree, any environmentally aware student knows that Fly-By is just horrible for the environment, ‘cause you go in there, you take all these plastic utensils, napkins, cups,” she says. “There were tiny little water bottles that were very small, so I would take three water bottles and then we’d be throwing them away.”
LET THE RESEARCH BEGIN
Mayer has worked with ESPP 10 for three years on different projects related to HUDS and sustainability. The first year, students attempted to develop a way to rate food based on environmental friendliness. The next year, they worked with vendors to improve food sustainability. Last year, their project was about how to effectively communicate HUDS’ sustainability efforts.
Fallon, Tian, and Zhang picked Fly-By for their project because of their exposure to HUDS in the course, the impact Fly-By has on student life, and Fallon and Tian’s observation of high trash levels. Zhang, who is also on the Crimson business board, was a freshman when he took the course and could not use the service at the time.
As part of their research, they collected statistics from HUDS and the Harvard Office for Sustainability. They also conducted focus groups and surveys which found that while most students use Fly-By at least once a week, few actually “fly by,” opting instead to sit in Loker Commons and eat.
Some of the research forced the three to go beyond disciplines within which they were comfortable.
“I don’t know a damn thing about making surveys and what is statistically sound,” Fallon says. “The whole point is that you’re bringing together a lot of academic areas that you don’t know a lot about, but the point of the project was to get knowledge really quickly about a subject and use it.”
Having collected data, they created and compared five plans, ranging from the most radical option of closing Fly-By altogether to a more modest solution, changing how HUDS promotes Fly-By. In their conclusion, they recommended replacing tableware with compostable alternatives, with the ultimate goal of shutting down Fly-By.
TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Martin says that this past spring, HUDS looked at the three students’ report and began the process of figuring out how to implement it. Most of the changes necessary involved simple switches in materials, but others took a little more thought.
“It took some creativity to move the beverages to fountain,” Martin says, referring to drinks now being served out of fountain dispensers rather than in pre-packaged containers. “That was never thought of before.”
The changes came on the heels of a similar switch at Chauhaus, a café at the Graduate School of Design. In January of 2008, HUDS swapped all tableware with compostable versions, and between January and July, according to the 2008 HUDS Sustainability Report, trash levels have plummeted 90 percent.
For Fly-By, HUDS scrapped milk cartons and water bottles, choosing to rely on drink dispensers found in the dining halls. A more environmentally-friendly plastic bag has replaced the transparent version used last year. Styrofoam has disappeared, as have the soup bowls and wax-lined cups. Compostable cups and containers now lie in their stead.
While compostable materials are more expensive, Martin says that the rise in price for materials was offset by the use of fountain beverages. In the end, the total switch was cost-neutral.
GOOD ENOUGH?
Fallon says he was not expecting HUDS to go through with the group’s recommendations.
“I honestly thought that it would not happen at all and that [Martin] was just being friendly,” he says. “It was sort of validating since we spent all this time talking about it, thinking about it, trying to pretend that it was real, and then it did end up being real.”
But now that some of their suggestions have been implemented, will the three authors become regular Fly-By diners?
Zhang says he’s been to Fly-By two or three times since its re-opening this year. But Fallon and Tian say they still choose to avoid it. While Fallon raises culinary objections to Fly-By (“Their food’s not that great,” he says), Tian still refuses to use Fly-By’s throwaway materials—even the more environmentally friendly ones.
“I don’t believe in Fly-By,” she says. “I go back to Currier, and I’m back in time for my 1:00 class. And I think going to Fly-By and using all these disposable things just creates so much waste.”
But, she says, she understands why some students still frequent Fly-By.
“I still think that it would be better if we got rid of Fly-By altogether, but I understand that from HUDS’ perspective and Harvard’s perspective that that’s something a lot of students would complain about,” she says. “It would be hard for that small number of students who really can’t eat lunch and don’t want to get Greenhouse [Café food] every single day because it’s expensive.”
Martin says that HUDS selected the solution that allowed Fly-By to continue operating with the most sustainable practices.
But Mayer is leaving the door open on any potential future changes to Fly-By.
“I think it’s great,” he says. “Does that mean that there aren’t some tweaks that could satisfy you, the student body, that are reasonable? Of course not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Vocal appeals for climate change action filled the lawn outside the Science Center yesterday as Massachusetts Power Shift, a statewide network of students dedicated to environmental issues, sought to build enthusiasm for their cause by representing the impact global warming has had on real people.
“Think of every high school cross-country teenager in Alaska who has to wait until December for the October snow,” said Timothy L.H. Treuer ’10, an Alaska native who was asked to speak at the event.
Mass. Power Shift Coordinator and founder Craig S. Altemose, who started the group with three others in 2007 after attending a national climate change conference in Washington, D.C., spoke at the event. Power Shift currently has chapters at 14 colleges across Massachusetts.
Yesterday’s event was part of a larger Power Shift campaign encouraging Massachusetts to lead the nation with a bill for 100 percent clean energy by 2020. The rally featured speeches from members of the group and was intended to raise Power Shift’s profile on campus.
“I have a story to tell about a planet in peril and your role in saving it,” said Altemose, speaking first.
For the next 20 minutes, Power Shift members tried to give what Treuer called a “human face to climate change.”
Treuer explained how global warming has affected every Alaskan—from the villagers whose homes are being destroyed by storm surges to suburban teenagers.
The rally was Mass. Power Shift’s first official event held at Harvard. “It’s good that we’re now established as a campaign here,” said event organizer Sophia Wen ’12, who is also a Crimson photography editor. “We can start being talked about.”
One of the primary aims of yesterday’s rally was to build attendance for Mass. Power Shift’s organizational meeting today in the Ticknor Lounge at 3:50 p.m. The time for the event is a reference to the figure 350 parts per million, which scientists have identified as the upper threshold of safe carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.
To publicize the rally and the Ticknor event, Power Shift members presented at a meeting of the Environmental Action Committee and sent out group e-mails.
Despite these efforts, all of the participants at yesterday’s rally were already involved with Power Shift.
“Obviously, we would have preferred a larger turnout, but I’ve been at rallies with 200 people and then you never see them again,” Altemose said.
Wen said that she thought the rally achieved its goal of publicizing today’s meeting.
Seven students who were not previously involved in the group signed up for more information, Wen said.
John E. Beatty ’11, who also spoke at the event, said the rally “cast a wide net,” adding that it “was the opening step to what will be a super successful fall campaign.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Red Sox clinched the American League Wild Card on Tuesday, 12 Harvard Law School students sitting in the box seats of the team’s CEO had an extra incentive to watch: course credit.
This semester, Law Professor Alan M. Dershowitz is co-teaching a first-year reading group—the Law School’s equivalent of a Freshman Seminar—with Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino.
“I’ve been a fan of baseball since I was 10, when Jackie Robinson first debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947,” Dershowitz said.
The class, “about the business and law of sports,” covers how to acquire a franchise, how to value players, how to deal with sports agents, the role of antitrust law, and how to get a stadium built. Thus far, the class has met twice—the second time in Lucchino’s box seats at Fenway.
Lucchino and Dershowitz both attended Yale Law School, and Lucchino came to Boston seven years ago when he took over the Red Sox.
When the reporter said he had only ever been to a Nationals game, Lucchino had a ready retort, flashing his team allegiance. “You can’t go see the Nationals,” he said. “That doesn’t count.”
Lucchino said he “used to be a real lawyer,” and explained how he found it “easy to strike up a friendship with Dershowitz.”
During an offseason trip to the Galapagos Islands, Dershowitz “concocted” the idea for the class, Lucchino said.
“It’s good for my personal development to be around the brightness of HLS students,” he said.
Lucchino explained that he “grew up with baseball,” a “part of Americana.”
“The daily competitiveness appeals to me,” he added.
But the spirit of the class is more relaxed, according to students.
“For most of the class, Lucchino and Dershowitz bounce ideas off each other. It’s pretty informal,” said Crosby W, Scofield, a first-year from San Antonio. “I’d never been to Fenway, It was great to see the World Series trophy and the executive meeting room.”
Scofield said that the course was a nice alternative to the 80-person classes typical of the first year of law school, as reading groups contain only ten to twelve students and are not taken for a grade. David M. Zucker, a first-year from Natick, Mass., cited the advantage of being able “to know a professor on a personal level.”
“It was a great opportunity to see the real world applications of what we’re learning in law school,” said Zucker, a “diehard” Sox fan. “[Owning a baseball team] is not the path most people take as lawyers, so it’s interesting to see what people who chose that path do.”
When asked if the new, laid back class meant that he was mellowing out, Dershowitz responded, invoking his Red Sox alter-ego: “No way. No way. No way. I’m the Kevin Youkilis of the Law school faculty. I get very angry when I don’t get my way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At exactly 1:03 p.m. yesterday, a funky jam began to blare in front of the John Harvard statue in the Yard. Within 10 seconds a crowd of at least 40 was circling a cluster of rainbow chairs, dancing freely in an enormous game of musical chairs.
This “spontaneous moment of joy” was the brainchild of American Repertory Theater’s new Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus ’87 and A.R.T. Artistic Fellow Allegra Libonati, but was executed with the help of dozens of unknowing participants strolling through Harvard Yard yesterday afternoon.
Paulus is spearheading the A.R.T.’s “EXPERIENCE THE A.R.T.” program, which “seeks to revolutionize the theater experience through a sustained commitment to empowering the audience,” according to the A.R.T.’s Web site.
“The goal [of yesterday’s performance] was just to bring some life into the Yard and make people talk,” one of the event’s instigators, Lexis B. Ross ’13, said.
Earlier this year, a similar event called the “Human Rights Theater Happening” invited students to engage in performance art at a human rights reception at the Harvard Faculty Club.
Participants from that event received an e-mail a few days ago from Libonati, seeking “instigators” for a “spontaneous moment of joy.” These volunteers in turn advertised the impending event through mysterious e-mails with messages inviting students to “join an undercover mission to create a 15-minute spontaneous, unexplainable, random act of joy.”
Rebecca S. Goldstein ’13, tipped off by one of these e-mails, cautiously approached the John Harvard statue at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. Within minutes, the musical chairs party was in action.
“Everyone I talked to right before said they were just there to watch, but then pretty quickly they all just joined in the dancing,” Goldstein said.
She said she thought the event challenged conventions about what constitutes art and simultaneously challenged stereotypes about Harvard being a “stuffy place.”
The party’s playlist included tracks such as “Hit the Road Jack” by Ray Charles, “Brick House” by The Commodores, and “Lollipop” by Mika.
At the end of the 15-minute game, scores of spectators watched as Libonati awarded the winner free tickets to “The Donkey Show,” an interactive, dance club-inspired rendition of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” co-directed by Paulus.
As the crowd in the Yard yesterday began to disperse, one runner-up yelled “Reset!” in the hopes of sparking a second game. Although the participants continued to trickle out, Ross said Libonati and Paulus would like to facilitate many similarly random occasions in the future, not only at Harvard but in the greater Boston area as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wearing nothing but a silver speedo, sneakers, and paint, a man darted around the atrium of Sanders Theatre last night—sticking out, to say the least, as students, Nobel laureates, and followers of the Annals of Improbable Research filed in to attend the “19th First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony” last night.
On stage, a poker table, a grand piano, a bar outfitted with shaker and glass, and people dressed in vibrant top hats, tails and Gatsbyesque dresses greeted attendees of the Ig Nobels, which honor people for findings that first make people “LAUGH, and then make them THINK.”
The night began with the Boston Squeezebox Ensemble—a set of accordion players in lab coats—processing into the theater following a 15-minute delay due to technical difficulties.
Once inside, the speedo-wearer’s eccentric, silver-bedecked appearance began to make sense: he served as one of three human spotlights that stood on stage and pointed out distinguished scholars as they were introduced throughout the ceremony.
This year’s winners of Ig Nobel awards—centered on the theme of risk—affected a wide range of people, from farmers to bar-brawlers to bankers to expectant mothers. And it was clear from the continuous laughter of the audience and the dozen or so Nobel Laureates onstage that the year’s selection catered to the dual mission of humor and thought.
The 2009 Ig Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for research from the University of Bern, Switzerland. Stephan Bolliger and Steffen Ross sought to determine whether a full or empty beer bottle did more damage when smashed over someone’s head (it was the latter). Bolliger accepted the award with a smile and proceeded to smash a prop bottle over his own head.
Earlier in the ceremony, Anthropology Professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86—with his back arched, abdomen pushed out, and hands resting on his flat belly—described the research, in words and action, that led to his honor.
Lieberman and his colleagues analytically determined why pregnant women do not tip over, despite the balance problems that humans must overcome as bi-peds.
They determined that the third lumbar vertebra that women have (but men do not) allows them to bend from the lower back in order to stay balanced with a swelling belly and higher center of gravity.
“[I had] never thought of this research as significantly funny, but apparently someone did,” Lieberman said. The crowd chuckled as he walked to receive his award with a his oxford shirt stuffed to look like a pregnant belly.
Other award-winning projects showed that cows give more milk if named, created diamonds from tequila, and transformed a brassier into a gas mask for two.
The Economics prize was awarded to officials of four Icelandic banks. None of the award recipients came to receive the award—one of multiple jokes coming at the expense of the banking industry.
This year’s opera, a tradition of the ceremony—performed between speakers, awards, and interludes of scientific experimentation—satirized the financial crisis and made clear that the year’s theme of risk did not only apply to academic experimentation.

Cabot House senior Ariel E.F. Shaker ’10 is in intensive care after suffering a “critical injury” yesterday, according to an e-mail sent to Cabot House residents by Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris late last night.
Shaker remained unconscious early this morning at Boston Medical Center with extensive internal bleeding in her head after she was injured yesterday, according to an e-mail sent to Harvard Polo Club members by coach Crocker Snow Jr ’61.
Snow’s e-mail contained no information about the precise nature of the injury and did not specify that it was sustained at Polo practice, but did state that Shaker had to be taken to the Medical Center by emergency helicopter, and that a team of specialists had arrived at the hospital to “determine whether and how [the] internal bleeding may be relieved.”
A Harvard representative—identified by Snow as the Harvard dean for emergency situations—was at the hospital yesterday evening with a collection of around a dozen of Shaker’s friends, roommates, and teammates, according to Snow’s e-mail.
“Those of you who were at polo practice late today have been waiting for news I promised of Ariel’s condition,” wrote Snow in his e-mail to the team. “Those who didn’t practice doubtless have heard about her accident by now.”
Harris, Snow, and fellow Polo Coach Cissie Snow could not be reached for comment last night.
A Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator and English secondary from Palo Alto, Calif., Shaker only recently joined the Polo Club, though she has long been a fan of riding horses.
Shaker also serves as the Resource Efficency Program representative for Cabot House.
Prior to joining the Polo Club, Shaker was a member of the women’s Heavyweight Crew team.
Jessica L. Flakne ’11, who rowed with Shaker on the crew team, said that Shaker is a “fun-loving person and very easy to be around.”
“She is someone I look up to in terms of being both a great rower and a great athlete,” Flakne said.
Women’s Polo Club captain Alexandra “Za” Tilt ’10 declined to comment on the accident on behalf of the team.
“Our overnight prayers must go out for Ariel, her family and for her attending doctors,” Snow wrote in his message to the team.

The Lehigh Mountain Hawks have yet to win a football game this season; they have suffered losses to Connecticut State, No. 2 Villanova, and Princeton. But their record may not be a clear indicator of their talent, and the Crimson (1-1) should expect to see a physical team in its matchup on Saturday.
“It seems like it could be a trap game,” captain Carl Ehrlich said, “but that’s not how our team’s looking at it at all. We’re going into it as if it’s the biggest game of the year. We’re treating them just like they’re 3-0.”
“Lehigh might be the best 0-3 I’ve ever seen,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy added. “They don’t lack for good players; they’re very big, very strong, very physical, [and] very fast on both sides of the ball.”
Although winless, the Mountain Hawks have made positive adjustments to their run defense in the first three weeks of the season. In its first two games, Lehigh gave up an average of 269 rush yards. In their third game, against Princeton, the Mountain Hawks controlled the Tigers’ offense, allowing only 163 total yards and just 47 through the air.
Lehigh’s defense may prove vexing for junior quarterback Collier Winters and a Crimson offense that has averaged 210 passing yards per game. Winters is coming off of a strong performance versus Brown last week when he went 18 for 27 for 223 yards, threw two touchdowns, and added another touchdown on the ground. The game earned him the New England Writer’s Gold Helmet Award and recognition as the Ivy League’s Offensive Player of the Week.
“Coming out of a huge win against Brown,” said senior running back Cheng Ho, “we have to be aware that there’s no such thing as a letdown. They’re very hungry for a win. They’ll claw, they’ll scratch, [they will] do whatever it takes. We’re expecting great intensity from them.”
Without a doubt, the Mountain Hawks have a ferocious defense and Harvard’s offense may have its hands full. The Lehigh line has racked up 23 tackles for losses—six of which were sacks—accounting for 101 lost yards.
“When we saw them just completely dismantle Princeton’s offense, we were impressed,” Murphy said. “We’re going to have to go down there with no thought of what their record is.”
“We’re not concerned [with] whether they force us to pass or force us to run,” junior receiver Marco Iannuzzi said. “If they force us to run, we’ve got Cheng Ho and Treavor Scales. If they force us to pass, we’ve got hands-down one of the best receiving corps in the league. So whatever they give us, we’re going to take it either way.”
The Lehigh-Harvard matchup has traditionally been a high-scoring one. In the last nine meetings between the two teams, there has been a combined scoring average of 60 points.
“They have a pretty good running game,” Ehrlich said, “but they’ve had trouble with quarterbacks. One of the biggest things for us will be making them one-dimensional.”
The Mountain Hawks’ sophomore quarterback Chris Lum replaced junior JB Clark in the fourth quarter during Lehigh’s game versus Princeton after Clark threw some costly interceptions early in the game. Lum will have to face the Crimson’s veteran defense in his first collegiate-level start, going head-to-head against Harvard’s pre-season All-American cornerbacks senior Derrick Barker and sophomore Matthew Hanson, as well as All-Ivy junior defensive back Collin Zych, who recorded eight tackles and a sack against Brown last week.
As reliable as the Crimson defensive backfield has been in breaking up passes, it still needs to cut down on its number of penalties. Harvard, as a team, has amassed 21 penalties for a total of 212 yards through the first two games, and the Crimson’s defense notched five costly errors last week against the Bears.
“We made way too many penalties against Brown,” Ho acknowledged. “We have great players at every position. We just need to execute and do what we came to do.”
If the Crimson can keep the penalties to a minimum this weekend, then Harvard should be able to contain the Mountain Hawks. But if not, the Crimson could afford Lehigh its first win of the 2009 campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a much-talked-about start in which the team won six consecutive games, the No. 8 Harvard men’s soccer team fell at last to then-No. 3 Wake Forest this past weekend. The loss was the first real blemish on an otherwise perfect season. Now the Crimson (6-1) must bounce back for the first time this season, facing Yale in the Ivy League opener.
Harvard visits the Bulldogs (2-3-2) tomorrow night in the 96th matchup between the two schools.
“[Losing] is not something we are used to,” co-captain midfielder Brian Grimm said. “It’s a little bit humbling.”
Even though the loss was to an extremely talented team, it has endowed the Crimson with a newfound resolve.
“We’re thinking about the loss,” Grimm said. “But we’ve done a lot to prepare ourselves [for Yale].”
“Great teams never lose two in a row,” coach Jamie Clark said. “Anyone can drop a game.”
Though Harvard has had an impressive overall start to the season, and is ranked eighth in the country, the Ivy League schedule is what counts. The Crimson aims to win the automatic NCAA Tournament entry that comes with the Ivy League title.
“Those were all nice asides,” Clark said of the many impressive victories earlier this season. “This [Yale game] is our main focus.”
“We’ve had a great start,” Grimm added. “But that’s all behind us now.”
Both teams will attempt to make their case early as contenders for the Ivy League championship by starting off 1-0.
“You don’t need to win every single game, but it certainly puts pressure on others if you get off to a fast start,” Clark said.
“Ivy League games are always a different sort of battle,” Grimm said. “The Ivy League will be particularly close this year. I don’t think there will be any room for error.”
Based on its performances this season, though, the Crimson will expect to dominate the struggling Bulldogs. Yale had an iffy start to the season and has won only twice, once over St. Francis College and once over Central Connecticut. The squad has lost the previous two games, and most recently was crushed by Sacred Heart 4-0.
“They’re not coming in with momentum or a great deal of confidence,” Clark said.
While Harvard is clearly the favorite, Clark emphasized that the game is by no means a lock.
“They are a team finding their way right now,” Clark said. “You never know what to expect because they’re shuffling in new players, trying new systems…It’s difficult to prepare for.”
The historic Harvard-Yale rivalry adds flavor to the matchup. While not as heated as in football, the game still means a lot to the players, especially due to the fact that the two schools recruit from the same pool of high school players.
“Seventy-five percent of [Yale’s] team looked at coming here and for one reason or another didn’t end up here,” Clark said. “That close connection with both schools makes for a great rivalry.”
Great rivalry notwithstanding, the Crimson has beaten the Bulldogs three years in a row.
But Clark feels that his team still has room to grow. Clark mentioned three midfield players in particular to watch: sophomore Ben Tsuda, junior Alex Chi, and senior Adam Rousmaniere.
“Those three are guys who have performed so well in practice and looked so well in games [that] it’s really just a matter of time before they get in the box scores,” Clark said. “It’s about time that they start appearing aside our big names.”
If Yale is to pull off the upset, they will need to find a way to stop these “big names.” The Crimson’s primary offensive weapons include co-captain Andre Akpan, who has six goals, and freshman forward Brian Rogers, who has two game-winning goals and four overall.
The Bulldogs must also circumvent sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms, who has a .880 save percentage and has allowed only three goals all season. Harms was named this week’s Ivy League Player of the Week—the second time this season that he has received the honor.
Harvard looks to use this game to set a tone for the remainder of the year.
“[Yale] is a huge game for us, based on the fact that we just lost and it’s the first game of the Ivy League season,” Clark said. “It’s the start of Ivy League play. That’s our focus every year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People at this school like to talk about the Harvard bubble. We live with a perpetual haze shrouding our eyes from reality, allowing us only to see a distorted conception of it, one in which every midterm means life or death and thesis deadlines mark the coming of Armageddon.
The illusion permeates every aspect of our lives. Candidates in student elections campaign with an urgency and self-importance befitting a presidential contender. Advocacy groups push for their righteous causes with such vigor and conviction that they might as well be lobbying for legislation in front of Congress.
The only arena seemingly left out of this arrangement of ours is athletics. While the common misconception is that sports aren’t huge here because our teams aren’t good (many of them are), the real reason is that most Harvard students are too immersed in their own great endeavors to care much. But sometimes we’re even able to cover up that reality.
Take last Friday night’s football game against Brown. We were raucous, we were drunk, and by the time the game arrived at its thrilling conclusion, we were really into it. Take away our Crimson Crazies t-shirts, ignore the vast swaths of empty seats (with 6,000 undergrads and 30,000 seats, the math doesn’t add up), and we could have been anybody at any school.
The players of the Harvard football team know that this week, reality sets in again. They might not see their audience hit four digits at a home game for the rest of the season. But I imagine that this brief taste of what they could have experienced every weekend elsewhere must have been nice.
Now they’ll trudge on, in front of their parents, significant others, and not too much more than that. But they’ll do so with their eyes set ahead—not in the stands—looking towards another Ivy League title.
And if they arrive at the Yale Bowl in Week 10 with that goal in sight—or even if they don’t, for that matter—they know we’ll be there, ready to delve into the surreal one more time.
PENN (0-2, 0-0 IVY) AT DARTMOUTH (0-2, 0-0 IVY)
“If you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything,” said my fourth grade teacher, Miss O’Leary. “Never kick a man when he’s down,” said various people in a bunch of movies. “Be nice to Dartmouth,” said the sports editor for today’s issue of The Crimson.
Fine, I’ll just talk about Penn—my “Numbers Don’t Lie, But They Can Deceive” pick of the week. Sure, the Quakers are 0-2. But they hung tough with No. 2 Villanova in Week 1, and fell in overtime to Lehigh last week after coming back from a 17-0 deficit—hardly anything to write Penn off in the Ivy League title race over. The Quakers have even more reason to remain optimistic when they look at their schedule. In the next three weeks, they have perennial Ivy League bottom-feeders Dartmouth and Columbia along with Bucknell, a mediocre-at-best Patriot League squad. That should be an easy 3-0, plus two Ivy wins to launch Penn into at least a tie for first in the Ancient Eight, so don’t count out the Quakers just yet.
Prediction: Penn 35, Dartmouth 13
LAFAYETTE (2-1) AT YALE (1-1, 0-1 IVY)
It’s hard to know what to make of either of these teams. Both have trounced Georgetown, but bragging about that would be like me talking smack after dunking on a third grader on a seven-foot hoop.
Lafayette nearly imploded against Penn last weekend and lost to Liberty—No. 24 in the country at the time, but since proven to be fairly overrated. Yale dropped an ugly 14-12 game to Cornell at home, losing on a failed two-point conversion attempt with time expired.
With neither squad making a strong case for victory, I’m going to go with the Bulldogs under the assumption that the team isn’t in the mood to get embarrassed twice in a row at home and quarterback Patrick Witt is going to have a rebound week.
Prediciton: Yale 24, Lafayette 20
RHODE ISLAND (1-2) AT BROWN (0-2, 0-1 IVY)
Here’s what I wrote about this matchup last year: “Rhode Island is an awful team, and any intrigue provided by the intrastate rivalry between the two squads will quickly dissipate after Brown jumps out to a big lead and clears the stands early.”
Of course, Brown lost that game, 37-13.
The worst part: I could easily write the same exact thing this year. Rhode Island has been outscored by its opponents by 49 points in three games. I am terrified of making this pick.
Prediction: Brown 28, Rhode Island 14
CORNELL (2-0, 1-0 IVY) AT COLGATE (4-0)
With Upstate bragging rights at stake, two undefeated behemoths march into Andy Kerr Stadium in Hamilton, N.Y., ready to prove, once and for all, who is the Sultan of the Sticks, the Baron of the Boonies, the Prince of Podunk. Cornell. Colgate. History begins now.
Actually, Cornell’s record is dubious at best, consisting of a win over the lowly Bucknell and an impressive, but nonetheless fluky victory against Yale. Colgate hasn’t exactly been playing the cream of the crop either, but its juggernaut rushing game and efficient aerial attack should be enough to put them over.
Prediction: Colgate 17, Cornell 10
COLUMBIA (1-1, 0-0 IVY) AT PRINCETON (1-1, 0-0 IVY)
Lions and Tigers and…Oh my, this should be interesting.
I’m still high on Columbia, despite a loss against Central Connecticut State last week. The Lions haven’t had a good offense since before it was my unpaid job to care about Ivy League football, but with a versatile attack featuring plenty of playmakers, they’re flying high this year. The defense isn’t quite there yet, but it’s coming along.
Princeton, on the other hand, hasn’t been able to generate any kind of offense, despite having the best running back in the league in Jordan Culbreath. I think we’re going to see Columbia finally make an early case to finish somewhere higher than “at least they’re better than Dartmouth” place this season.
Prediction: Columbia 24, Princeton 21
HARVARD (1-1, 1-0 IVY) AT LEHIGH (0-3)
Harvard has to drive six hours to Lehigh, Penn. to play a meaningless game against a mediocre opponent. Should be a doozy, but you never know, right?
Prediction: Harvard 27, Lehigh 17
Last week: 3-3
Record to date: 7-7

Cornell students are getting high on Adderall, Red Bull, and caffeine cocktails just to get through the night. “At this point, it’s practically like cocaine,” one student said of Adderall, adding that he's seen students “crush up Adderall and snort it."  Yes, they study at Cornell.  Hardcore, apparently.
More students are raping each other at Penn and Yale. We wonder why?

Now that former Yale Provost Andrew Hamilton has started work as Oxford's vice-chancellor (i.e. president) today, every former Yale provost in the last two decades (there are eight of them) has now claimed a prominent college presidency. Harvard Provost Steve Hyman has also been considered for top posts at several colleges, including Harvard and MIT, but so far has been turned down—for now.
More Ivy League news after the jump.
A controversial Danish cartoonist spoke at Princeton yesterday, revealing that four years after he'd printed a controversial cartoon of the prophet Muhammad with a bomb as a turban, the police still have to escort him to work.
The Cornell Daily Sun prints a biweekly sex column called "Come Inside." FlyBy shudders.
Yale's career services office knows the ins and outs of finding students finance jobs, but can barely help students land jobs in the arts. Sound familiar?
Yale is now scouring for an additional 5 percent in budget cuts from departments, since administrators had planned for an economic rebound that never came, and humanities and foreign language departments are suffering. “The only area where we can reduce costs is the one area where undergrads need us the most, language instruction,” Benjamin Foster, acting chair of Yale's Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations department, told the Yale Daily News. “But it’s chickenfeed compared to the rest of Yale’s budget.”

Yes! It’s the episode Gleeks everywhere have been waiting for: Kristin Chenoweth guest stars on Glee. Find out what’s going on at McKinley High after the jump (spoilers ahead):
This week, Mr. Schue learns that Carmel High is intentionally flunking students to keep them in rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline (no wonder those actors are so old-looking), so he enlists alcoholic dropout April Rhodes (Chenoweth) to replace Rachel. The sinful April wins the club over by corrupting them, and Emma confronts Will about the compromises he’s making. Is Emma right, or is she just jealous of Will’s “first crush”? (Emma’s poor luck in love keeps getting more and more hilarious. The episode implies that she once had an “online flirtation” with Andrew Cunanan.) Meanwhile, Rachel’s prospects are limited to future YDN-reporter Jacob who just wants to see her “over-the-shoulder boulder holder.” Finn swoops in to put the moves on her again, but he's actually wooing her to come back to glee so he can get a music scholarship. Finn, we didn’t know you were capable of manipulative scheming! Shameless. The truth comes out, and Rachel lets him have it -- a welcome change from her tiresome moping. FlyBy loved that she also has a verbal catfight with Glinda the Good Witch Chenoweth herself. April gets her moment in the spotlight, repents (a bit), and steps aside in time for Rachel's overdue return and the finale.
Musical Numbers
“Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey
The song is a good throwback (we were starting to wonder if New Directions was bothering to amass a repertoire or just burning through new song after song) and it serves its purpose of highlighting the club’s dependence on Rachel. But the number is weak, and not just because it’s short. Quinn’s voice cracks, and based on Mr. Schue’s non-reaction, it’s not part of the plot.
C
“Maybe This Time” made famous by Liza Minnelli
April and Rachel both make it their own and skip the Liza impression. Chenoweth nails it, of course. The song’s perfect for her character, and she plays it effortless, funny, and sympathetic. Rachel cleverly turns the optimistic song on its head, making it about unraveling desperation. But while actress Lea Michele hits the notes beautifully, she just doesn’t leave herself quite enough room to act, coming across more shell-shocked than dejected.
A-
“Cabaret” made famous by Liza Minnelli
Rachel camps it up in this snippet, but fascist art director Sandy Ryerson is right – it’s boring. The song’s about living life to the fullest, so why is she holding herself back?
D
“Alone” by Heart
Goodness, does Chenoweth have some crossover appeal. Why is the woman not a pop star yet? April belts and brings back the 80s, while Mr. Schue provides spot-on backup vocals. If only the performance were a little longer.
A-/B+
“Last name” by Carrie Underwood
Glee’s songs are usually very literal choices, so we were a bit thrown by this one. It apparently serves the purpose of introducing April’s character … before she leaves. The choreography is tepid, and the performance is only saved by the strength of the song itself and by April’s sass.
B
“Somebody to Love” by Queen
With Finn’s thin, airy voice sliding up to its pitch, the song’s weak start had FlyBy skeptical. Why tackle this without Freddie Mercury? But as it progresses, the arrangement weaves the main vocal line into a duet and emphasizes the collaborative elements of the song’s choral ending. The choreography is simple, but with Rachel finding her voice again and Mercedes getting a chance to shine, it’s more than enough. Bring on the first competition.
A
Missing Plotlines
Sue’s Corner
Sue’s barely in this episode. We’re sure she’s busy cooking something devilish up – can’t wait to find out what. Best Only line of the week: “I was aroused, then furious.”
The Short Version
Kurt gets drunk. Puck spills the beans on Quinn. FlyBy loves Kristin Chenoweth. Rachel (finally) rejoins New Directions, the “world’s worst Benneton ad.”
Seconds before someone runs out of the practice room in distress: 25
Is Fox-owned Myspace.com a plot point: Yes
Overall: A. Great character development. The strongest collection of musical numbers since the pilot. This episode is going to be a classic when we look back.

The Harvard Voice was really excited when it realized that the Harvard-Brown football game might mean a visit from "Harry Potter" actress Emma Watson. And so the Voice live blogged, all night long. Well, it didn't really blog about any actual sightings of Watson for quite some time, but rather more about its increasing desire to see her. And finally, the Voice saw the crown jewel of England in person. And took a picture. That was when the Voice got in trouble.
The student publication is battling media accusations that it strategically planned to stalk Watson during the night game last week. Here's a title that cuts to the chase: “Harvard Jerks Stalked Emma.” The New York Post article, which was published yesterday, accuses the Voice of trying to "draw as much attention to [Watson] as possible" with its live blog updates and its blurry photograph of her leaving the Harvard stadium. Watson was supposedly "quite shaken," as security guards tried to protect her from a crowd of stalkers, the Post reported in a brief on Tuesday.
So what actually happened? Did the Voice unleash its staffers onto Harvard stadium in vigilant search of Watson? Well, Alisha D. Ramos ’12, editor-in-chief of The Voice, posted an official response to the situation on the Voice blog yesterday afternoon, denying accusations that the publication planned to harrass Watson. Find out more about the conflict in today's article in The Crimson.
