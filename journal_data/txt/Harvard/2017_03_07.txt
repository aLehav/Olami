After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renowned British conductor Nicholas McGegan has been the music director of San Francisco’s Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and Chorale for more than 30 years. Educated at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, the conductor is a specialist in baroque and classical music. His service to music overseas has made him an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, and this past fall, he served a residency as the Christoph Wolff Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Harvard. The Crimson sat down with McGegan before his performance conducting a program of Mozart at the Handel and Haydn Society in Boston on March 3 and 5.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get into conducting?
Nicholas McGegan: Before I went to university in the late 60s, I went to a music school in the U.K., and I was the only one of the group who didn't play a string instrument. I played the flute. So they said that I really had nothing to do, so why don’t I conduct while they play. So I was about 17 or 18 at the time. At this point, I’ve been conducting for 50 years, which is a nice long time. I went to the University of Cambridge (the other Cambridge!) and I conducted there. I conducted all the main orchestras, the chamber orchestra, and the opera. Then I went to Oxford and did much of the same thing. That meant that I never actually studied conducting, I just did it. I didn’t go to a music college. Certainly in Cambridge in those days you didn't study any practical music. The coursework was entirely academic. But since I played the flute, I got to play in orchestras. So I got to see how other conductors worked, and I learned from them.
THC: What is it like to direct the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra? Have you enjoyed it?
NM: I mean, what’s not to like about the Bay Area? Except for perhaps the earthquakes. I absolutely love it out there. I am so lucky to have been with that orchestra for 30 years. Most conductors don't last that long with orchestras, so it has been a real treat to help mold the style and repertoire. And I’ve had a great time there. Maestros basically keep going until they fall off their perch. We don't have a retirement age. We’re supposed to be like good wine! We just get better and better with age … so I’m in my late sixties having the time of my life.
THC: What do you hope to get out of the Handel and Haydn performance?
NM: I think the great thing is that the H&H orchestra tends to play non-dramatic music. But I have come in with a program that is very much not like that. It is very dramatic ballet music. It is quite exciting. We are going in with a Mozart piece that he wrote in four days, which is actually the least wild piece of the night. Then to a ballet, then the last piece is a symphony by a Basque composer who died when he was 19. He had already written a symphony. He died of tuberculosis in Paris in 1826. That is a piece that doesn't get performed very often. Wonderful piece. And, actually, a rather miserable piece. Not surprising when you're dying at 19. One sometimes forgets that these are actual human beings writing this music, and just because they wore nice wigs or whatever that doesn’t mean they didn't have passionate beating hearts.
THC: Is there anything in particular that still gets you excited about conducting after so long?
NM: I mean, I just love music. Part of the job of the conductor is to be an idea person. And that’s fine—I hope I have lots of ideas about repertoire and how the music should be performed. A conductor also has to be a communicator. So my job is to take the music that has to be played and encourage the orchestra to play it a certain way. And of course to be a communicator with the audience. So I suppose a conductor is an interpreter, which is a grand version of the word salesman. There are other parts of the conductor’s job, particularly fundraising and all that stuff. But the music is my favorite part. Being an interpreter, a communicator, and an advocate for the music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We’ve got to ditch Liam Neeson, but ‘Taken’ must go on.” This isn’t a sentence any sane person would say. And yet on Feb. 27, NBC premiered their new series, “Taken,” a Neeson-free prequel to the film franchise.
From almost any angle, this series looks ill-conceived. Liam Neeson carried the “Taken” franchise. As divorced father and retired CIA operative Bryan Mills, Neeson added a bizarre middle-aged twist to the standard action movie form. He famously warned his daughter’s kidnapper that he had “a particular set of skills,” and dispatched a host of gunmen with the same cold and precise efficiency the euphemism evokes—all with a soft Irish brogue and a gloomy, tired expression. Removing him from the franchise excises everything that was memorable about “Taken.”
Instead, the role of the young Bryan Mills is played by Clive Standen, whose primary achievement here is that from the right angle, and in dim lighting, he looks uncannily like a young Liam Neeson. Standen doesn’t do a bad job, exactly, but he certainly does do an uninteresting one. His younger Mills— motivated by a cocktail of rage, regret, and testosterone—lacks the strengths of the original and doesn’t bring any of its own to the table.
Some of the premiere’s action scenes do capture the peculiar charm of the first film. Mills outmaneuvers pursuers in a garage with clockwork efficiency, and when killers creep up to his house he calmly shoots them through the front door. There are a few winks to fans of the films as well: A pursuer comments that Mills has “got some skills,” for instance. (Get it?)
The episode’s plot as a whole, on the other hand, is entirely devoid of charm. Mills’ sister is killed; he embarks on a bloody revenge spree. The pace does pick up a bit in the second half of the episode, but the first half is simply an unpleasant slog.
There are a few things to praise about the premiere. The best performance of the night, such as it was, was delivered by Kris Holden-Ried, playing a onetime comrade of Mills’. His character couldn’t fairly be described as interesting, but there was at least a little nuance. (Ried will not be returning to the show for another episode.) No performance was so spectacularly bad as to distract from the rest of the show. The action scenes were competently handled, and in a few places downright good.
On the basis of the premiere alone, there is very little reason for anyone to watch “Taken.” In the interests of charity, however, it should be noted that the pilot episode is almost totally unrepresentative of the rest of the show: “Taken” appears to be an ensemble show about a team of covert operatives. Apart from Standen’s Mills, none of the other members of the ensemble have really been introduced yet. The pilot demonstrates that neither the leading man nor his backstory will be particularly interesting, but an ensemble show can get by with a bland lead as long as the minor characters are interesting.
With that in mind, I will not pass judgment on “Taken” yet—it may be that the parts of the show that emerge in later episodes will be much better. With that said, no one should have any reason to watch the pilot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I walk through art museums, I often notice half-colored canvases and partial figure drawings, placed prominently in frames beside drawings and paintings that are more obviously complete. Last year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art mounted an exhibition called “Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible.” The exhibition explored the question of why we label some artwork unfinished, categorizing artwork as either pieces whose process was 
halted by some sort of accident or pieces that are purposely constructed with an incomplete aesthetic — in other words, finished in an unfinished way.
The second category finds close parallels in architecture. An “unfinished” aesthetic is not uncommon in modern and contemporary buildings. Even on Harvard’s campus, for example, Mather House trumpets rather than conceals its construction, its unfinished look characteristic of Brutalist architectural style.
Less attention is paid, however, to genuinely unfinished architecture. While I may marvel at a half-exposed canvas in a museum, my instinctive reaction to passing a building under construction is exasperation: The ugly scaffolding is blocking my view of the facade. Architecture that is halted mid-creation is usually labeled “abandoned” rather than unfinished, and visible construction or renovation is considered an eyesore.
So why is it then, that unfinished drawings are beautiful, while unfinished buildings are at best unappealing? In theory, the same things that draw me to unfinished drawings—the visual representation of process—should draw me to unfinished buildings as well. Maybe the difference is an issue of context and scale, or perhaps of the practical roles buildings play. It would be easier to be frustrated by the waste of resources in an unfinished building than a drawing, and a building under construction is often unable to fulfill its intended function. Yet, when I pass a building as I walk down the street, I don’t need it to function, and I don’t necessarily know anything about its funding or history. I interact with it purely visually.
This suggests that the difference lies in our visual experience of each art form, or perhaps in our visual expectations. The concept of an “unfinished aesthetic” depends on a preconceived notion of what a finished piece ought to look like. Without that notion, pieces would simply be finished when the artist stopped working on them. Perhaps our conception of what finished architecture looks like is less fluid than our conception of what finished sculpture or drawing looks like. Fluid expectations for how fine art ought to look allow us to register the unfinished aesthetic while still appreciating the work as a finished piece. The stricter conception of what finished architecture looks like makes it more difficult to appreciate an unfinished building as a piece meritorious in its own right.
It is difficult to know exactly what shapes our visual reactions, and it’s hard to say whether I’ll be able to shake off my instinctive annoyance at construction. I do believe, however, that it is possible to appreciate unfinished buildings as we do unfinished drawings and paintings. The metal grid of the scaffold is no different from the guidelines in a perspectival drawing, and revealed interior beams are the same as a monochrome underpainting for a portrait in oil.

Ballet, known for its physical representation of music, is not often associated with the spoken word. But William Forsythe brings voice into ballet, without obscuring the aspects of technicality and classical style. Far from traditional, but definitely encapsulating the grace of classical ballet, Forsythe’s restaging of his ballet, “Artifact,” ran in the Boston Opera House Feb. 23-26 and March 2-5.
“Artifact” begins without the dimming of lights or the preparation of an overture. Rather, the titular character of the “Woman in Gray,” steps meticulously across the stage. The ballet is split into four parts, each set to a different piece of music—Part II is J.S. Bach’s “Chaconne” in D-minor, while Parts I and IV are accompanied by Eva Crossman-Hecht’s piano improvisations centered around Bach’s “Chaconne,” and Part III is one of Forsythe’s original works.
As the “Woman in Historical Dress,” Dana Caspersen exhibits immense control over vocals and her highly-trained dance background shines through. Caspersen was a member of Frankfurt Ballet for 16 years and then Forsythe Ballet for 10. The fluidity with which she moves across the stage and the way her arms move with her voice reflect the years of dance that she has mastered. Her recitation was engaging and powerful, especially in its raw form in Part III, which was accompanied only by rhythmic sounds produced by the ballet dancers with no instrumental music.
In spite of Caspersen’s mastery over the part, Part III seemed prolonged. The repetition of the same words, “I/you,” “see/think/hear,” and their past tenses eventually becomes somewhat monotonous, especially when the dancers on the sides of the stage who are clapping and stomping along look uncomfortable and stiff.
The dancing is precise and elegant. Many ballet companies of a similar size to Boston Ballet have strong and cohesive women in the corps de ballet, but the same cannot be said for men. However, Boston Ballet exhibits an especially talented force of male dancers in “Artifact.” Forsythe’s choreography highlights an intense and rejuvenating section in Part I, featuring a small ensemble of male dancers displaying both meticulous technique and artistic flair.
In the beginning of Part IV, the spotlights are especially effective in highlighting the dancer silhouettes, set against the backdrop of panels reminiscent of life-sized painted canvases in a museum. The curtain comes down in almost sporadic moments in Part II, with loud clangs each time it closes—at first, creating some confusion, but later effectively leaving the audience wanting more.

For the North American debut of “Artifact,” Forsythe chose a suitable group in Boston Ballet’s suite of dancers. While the lack of dancing in Part III may feel alienating in its divergence from tradition, it’s an innovative piece for Boston Ballet that showed off the company’s versatility. Any shortcomings could be attributed to the nature of the work, because of its unconventionality, rather than the dancers themselves. That said, Forsythe’s staging leaves little to complain about. To enjoy the show, one simply needs the patience to understand, in the words of the Woman in Historical Dress, whether you think “you see what you hear what you thought what you saw what you thought what you heard what you saw what you thought what you see.”

UPDATED: March 18, 2017 at 10:13 a.m.
The diversity and talent of the College was on full display Saturday evening at the Harvard Foundation’s 32nd Cultural Rhythms show. The show—part of a whole week of dialogue around race, ethnicity, and gender—featured many of Harvard’s cultural performance groups. Ranging from Harvard Taekwando to a full mariachi band, every act was distinctly representative of a particular form of artistic expression. Taken in total, Cultural Rhythms was a medley of traditional (and untraditional) performances from around the world.
Of course, the true star of Cultural Rhythms was its guest of honor: actress Viola Davis. Having won an Oscar less than a week before, she became the first black person to win an Emmy, a Tony, and an Oscar. She was in Sanders Theatre to receive the Harvard Foundation’s 2017 Artist of the Year Award. After receiving the award, Davis gave a speech about art as a means of spreading a message and changing minds. Davis said that acting for her means telling the stories of people that might not otherwise get heard. “I want people to be seen,” she said. “I want them to feel less alone.”
The performances lived up to Davis’ conception of art. Starting with Ballet Folklorico, a traditional Mexican dance group, and ending with the Kuumba Singers every act did an incredible job of representing their cultures and putting on an entertaining show. Particularly deserving of mention are the Harvard Breakers, a group of skilled breakdancers; the Asian American Dance Troupe, whose members gave a powerful and acrobatic display; Harvard Mariachi, impressive for both their exuberance and their ability; and of course the aforementioned Kuumba Singers. However, every group was so unique and talented that it’s nearly impossible to pick favorites.
These cultural performances weren’t the only fun thing on stage that evening, as the hosts nearly stole the show. Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 and Karen Chee ’17 were at once gracious and hilarious, with great quips and gags. In an especially memorable moment, after the Breakers performed, Roberts and Chee took turns giving the leaders of the dance troupe their numbers. Chee even held up a sign with her real number written on it, a move she lightheartedly said she regretted even while doing it. If the Oscars are still looking for a host for next year, they could do much worse than Chee and Roberts.
The grand finale of the evening saw all the leaders of the groups come out onstage and dance together to the Jackson 5 Classic “ABC.” Each pair of performers put their own unique spin on the song. Here, the dancers from the Hellenic Society stepped and dipped, while there, Bhangra members leapt and stomped. None of the responses were better than any of the others, and all deserved to be celebrated. Cultural Rhythms more than succeeded in celebrating them.

“XX” is a horror anthology composed of four segments (Jovanka Vuckovic’s “The Box,” St. Vincent’s “The Birthday Party,” Roxanne Benjamin’s “Don’t Fall” and Karyn Kusama’s “Her Only Living Son”), united by their writers’ and directors’ identity as women. A Tim-Burtonesque sequence of misshapen dolls and crawling hands transitions between the four, drawing in themes from each. Each section, as short stories often do, leaves questions unanswered, some more successfully than others.
Failing to heed the warning in its own title, “Don’t Fall” falls flat, lagging behind the other segments in quality. Featuring four friends on a camping trip from hell, it differs enough from the other short films to feel incongruous, and the story is undermined by clichés typical of monster stories. Though it has its fair share of blood and gore, the fear is not lasting. In comparison, “The Box” is stronger, but also not entirely satisfying, and “Her Only Living Son,” while well-done and disturbing, feels slightly abrupt as well.
“The Birthday Party” is the best in the anthology. If the other segments take themselves slightly too seriously, “The Birthday Party” does the opposite. The story follows a mother who refuses to let death interfere with her daughter’s party plans. It is packed with dark humor, from the overall concept to the details—a mix of everything from physical comedy to a panda-bear theme. The segment also pokes fun more directly at horror films. An off-putting household assistant in all black serves as the perfect female parody of the creepy butler so common to the genre. And in one scene, the child, dressed in a white sheet, frightens her mother by yelling “boo,” a self-deprecating jab at jump scares, which the segment makes ample use of. Apart from being funny, the story is also satisfyingly eerie, twisted and frightening, and the effect of its dark comedy is heightened by the more serious short films that surround it. “The Birthday Party” makes the entire anthology worth a watch.
The emphasis on the film’s female directorship invites analysis of its treatment of women. Each segment has a female protagonist, but the question remains as to how they are portrayed. Horror is a tricky genre through which to reconsider traditional gender roles. One common criticism of mainstream films is the sexist trope of the damsel in distress. But in horror, more often than not, all the characters are essentially damsels in distress, victims of some dark force. The resulting sense of hopelessness and impending doom are part of the genre’s draw.
“Her Only Living Son” does the best job of reversing the damsel-in-distress trope. Throughout the segment, the protagonist steadfastly holds on to her son. In the climax, she shows unnatural power and calm in the face of darkness. This scene succeeds in imbuing the female protagonist with impressive strength, without detracting from that terror-inducing helplessness which is crucial to the genre. The concept of female power does not belong to the last segment alone. In fact, each of the four manages to portray women, despite their victimhood, as in control. This manifests in wildly different ways. In “The Box,” the protagonist is immune to a mysterious force, while in “Don’t Fall,” she is all too involved in the gory events. All four, however give the impression that their female protagonists have some eerie knowledge or strength that nobody else does.
There are many ways, however,  in which the film adheres to the classic treatment of women in horror. “The Box” takes Jack Ketchum’s short story of the same title and simply shifts the point of view from the father to mother. Aside from this switch, the film is strikingly loyal to Ketchum’s story, and some of the questionable portraits of gender are preserved. For example, a scene in the book in which the father loses his temper with his son remains in the film as a show of the husband’s masculinity, leaving the woman stereotypically quiet and calm. Instances like this are scattered throughout the film. In fact, by making their protagonists mothers, three of the segments conform to the traditional gender roles of horror at the most basic level.
Yet these instances of conformity should be considered intentional. Rather than depicting women who have risen above the gender-related problems of society, this anthology sheds light on these issues, particularly maternal pressures, by making them driving forces of dark plots and haunting effect. In “The Birthday Party” and “Her Only Living Son,” for instance, loyalty to their children urges the protagonists to engage in activities that turn out to be lethal. Here, the demands of motherhood become an instruments of horror. By placing this pressure at the center of the sinister plots, “XX” uses the common trope of mothers in horror to call attention to the often-overlooked burdens of motherhood. This self-reflexive use of stereotype might be the film’s biggest contribution to the horror genre.

About one in 20 Harvard students takes a leave of absence every year for a variety of involuntary and voluntary reasons. While the decision to leave can be a challenging and complex one, lamentably the process to come back can prove to be just as thorny and stressful—particularly for the students who have to navigate the complex logistical barriers and administrative hoops that await them upon their return to Harvard. As students on leave continue to struggle with obstacles in returning to campus, Harvard must ensure that it remains a welcoming environment by finding ways to facilitate a successful and productive re-entry process.
Currently, the responsibilities and tasks required to return to Harvard rest far too much on the shoulders of students themselves. Students face extensive obstacles such as securing housing on campus by the appropriate deadlines, earning the votes of the Administrative Board, and passing health assessments, among others. Though the College prides itself on facilitating leaves of absence, this onerous process may deter students from taking advantage of a leave of absence at all.
Administrators must also consider instituting changes to the current re-entry process to improve the transition for students returning to campus. One way to address these difficulties would be to establish better communication and outreach so that students have more contact with a House official or another affiliate of the College during their time off. Some students on leave commented that Harvard initiated almost no communication. Efforts to reach out to students would alleviate some of the burden that students face when managing complicated deadlines and paperwork. These changes would further ensure that the students’ House communities remain up-to-date on their plans and are ready to welcome them back to campus upon their return.
Taking a leave of absence is often a valuable—but by no means effortless—experience. It will take continued conversation between students and administrators to improve the transition for those on leave. These conversations may be difficult, especially considering the stigma around certain motives for leaves, but they are necessary.
Given these preconceived notions surrounding mental health and the various other reasons that lead students to take a leave of absence, we especially commend the students who have shared their experiences taking time off. Their candor sheds light on the benefits and challenges of a reality that so many members of our community go through during their time at the College.

Dear Class of 2020,
We’ve been tinkering away for months. We’ve ordered the t-shirts, painted the signs, crafted the Housing Day Videos, and now all that remains is meeting you! House life continues and builds on what already makes Harvard great: the caring, committed mentors who will surround you, the strangers you would have never guessed would become your closest friends, and the odd traditions, old and new, that will make you laugh and question why past generations ever thought of them in the first place.
We imagine your time at Harvard has already shown you that things here never quite unfold as you expect. Many of us remember feeling the jitters you feel this week and soaking up every rumor about which house we should hope for. It turns out, though, that no matter which house comes knocking on Thursday, there are unexpected treasures awaiting you:
In Mather, you can enjoy stunning views of Cambridge and Boston from your very own single or lounge in the sun-filled dining hall, which has the best view of the river on campus. In the spring, get #Clean at the legendary Mather Lather, Cambridge’s only annual foam party. In the fall, enjoy the sophomore beach retreat. And all year, enjoy one of Boston’s best Happy Hours every other week. In the words of our ever-watchful guardian Conan O’Brien, “Finally, I am home!”
If you’re in Cabot, you’ll be able to relax on the Quad lawn or grab a late night beverage at Cabot Café, where you’ll often find Rakesh and Stephanie hanging out and chatting. You’ll be welcomed by the enthusiasm and communal spirit of Cabotians into a house that values compassion, inclusion, and openness.
Or maybe you’ll be just across the street in Pfoho, waiting on an order of piping-hot chicken strips at the Quad Grille or playing with the House guinea pigs just down the hall. You might be cozying up by the fireplace with a mug of cider at Sunday night Hygge—that is, unless Anne and John have prepared another one of their renowned Open Houses. No matter who you are, you’ll find yourself in a Pfamily with as many kooky traditions as “Pf” puns. And just as our double-decker dining hall suggests, we leave space for all kinds of people to make themselves at Pfohome.
Quincy House is the people's house. When you get Q-House, you'll know that your club directors will beg you to schedule meetings because your house is the most centrally located. You'll know that our amazing House staff will take care of you (and guarantee you a single junior year), and you'll learn that whether it's getting way too into Assassins in the spring or sharing some mozz sticks by the grille, there's nothing Q values more than our people.
You could be in Dunster House, whose beautiful courtyard overlooking the Charles is home to our Luau Stein, Goat Roast, and Spring Formal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“All people here do is brag about how little sleep they get.”
This stopped me in my tracks. Usually, my mornings at Annenberg consist of controlling my quaking hands so my coffee doesn’t spill and making up fake lives for other breakfast-goers. The person two tables ahead preps for a marathon this weekend, picks at their egg whites and grilled chicken. The kid with the headphones and a laptop is furiously scribbling the answers to a p-set due in 10 minutes. I was beginning to marionette an alternate reality for the girl sitting diagonal to me, but her conversation piqued my interest.
“One person will say ‘Oh, I’ve got a midterm this week’, and the other will try to one-up them: ‘Yeah, I’ve got two midterms and a paper.’ And that’ll be it.” I take a sip of my coffee; the fault lines in my palms graze past each other, slow their movements. I catch a glimpse of my reflection on my phone screen; dog-tired eyes caricaturing a long night at Lamont, regret tucked soundly under shadows beneath them. I tasted my earlier comment on my own lack of sleep between my teeth, a bitter pill I wish I hadn’t swallowed. “I think it’s pathetic,” she says. Her friends nod their head in agreement. Their conversation stagnates. The boy next to me shifts uncomfortably. After some silence, the group says their polite goodbyes and dissipates. I finish my coffee, wiping the sleep from my face and folding it into my palm, ashamed. I head to class.
What can I say? She’s right—it is a huge component of the general conversation here. Sit down, talk about blocking/midterms/essays/clubs and guess what else? Lack of sleep. I, along with most others, have perfected the “haha I’ve got mountains of homework and responsibilities and haven’t slept but it’s great” look—the personification of the smiling emoji with the bead of sweat hovering at its brow; it never drops, and neither does this image. We out of habit pose ourselves as this tentative Jenga masterpiece, stacking a litany of responsibilities and stretching our capacity so thin just to see how far we can go until the blocks fall apart. Competition is in the air we breathe; from morning to night, wake to sleep, we are in constant flux with the people around us to see who has the stamina, the endurance to accomplish it all. This permeates every aspect of our time here—especially our sleep schedules.
While my interlocutor was right to point out that a lack of sleep should not be used as yet another vessel for competition at this school, dismissing the sleep rhetoric as simply “pathetic” glosses over the nuances behind why one would talk about it. This could be a plea for a shoulder to lean on, a subtle suggestion to others that you might be struggling but don’t want to ask for help. Putting ambitions and an unwavering will to succeed before mental and physical well-being is rote, a staggeringly common habit in this environment. Complaining about a lack of sleep could be a call for commiseration, a search for understanding and support for one’s actions. Too often is this aspect overlooked and deemed unimportant. Students would rather bottle up their exhaustion until it reaches the brim and overflows before they ask for help. This process of ignoring physical and mental health by making one’s lack of sleep a joke and relegating it to an insignificant soundbite is cyclic, rampant, and absolutely detrimental.
So instead of the usual alternate realities I attribute to passersby in Annenberg, I imagine how the girl from breakfast in Annenberg might actually walk through life. She might be incredibly conscientious and organized, fulfilling her responsibilities and completing her homework at reasonable hours. She might get eight hours of sleep a day, gifting herself extra hours on weekends. She might be a napper, and give herself a well-deserved sleep break when the stress builds up too high. She might have it all.
Or, she might have sleeping habits more consistent with the general Harvard student than first impressions suggest. She could spend her nights caged by bookshelves, mornings spent slamming the snooze button, trying to stop time with the weight of her hand. Bobbing her head up in down from exhaustion in lecture like a swimmer gasping for air before they dive right back into the abyss—but she wouldn’t tell anyone this struggle. She would shy away from her problems for fear of sounding like a regurgitation of the competition mentality she despises—and as her lack of sleep mounts, she wouldn’t have anyone to turn to to lessen the stress. It could consume her.
To those of us who don’t get enough sleep—it shouldn’t be a badge of honor, but it shouldn’t be ignored either. It’s not pathetic to talk about your struggles. Recognize them, seek out support, and try to rectify the situation through conversation rather than blanket them under the guise of humor or competition. There are multiple avenues to receive support—or just to have a person to talk to on campus—should this prove to be a large issue in your life.
Oh, and one last thing—get some sleep every now and then. It’ll do you wonders.

Harvard’s Climate Change Solutions Fund awarded about $1 million in grants to scholars from across the University, funding seven projects dedicated to understanding and mitigating climate change.
The fund, started by University President Drew G. Faust in 2014, has so far distributed around $3 million to projects on climate change policy, solar energy technology, and threats to the environment, among other sustainability-related topics.
Projects funded this year include a “bionic leaf” that could reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a work of fiction imagining what a fossil fuel-free future could look like, and a proposal to use Harvard’s campus as a “living laboratory” to improve sustainability in dining halls.
“Universities have a uniquely important role to play in the battle against climate change, and Harvard must continue to be at the forefront of efforts to bring disciplines together, deepen awareness of the issue, and speed progress,” Faust said in a University press release. “This year’s Climate Change Solutions Fund awards will help experts from engineering, medicine, chemistry, public health, public policy, and the arts confront the challenges facing our society and our planet at a moment when the dire consequences of inaction are becoming increasingly apparent.”
The seven projects were as varied in discipline as in focus, with faculty hailing from five of the University’s schools.
Kennedy School professor Henry Lee III ’68 and environmental science professor Daniel P. Schrag, for example, will research obstacles to decarbonization in China, examining the country’s energy dependence on coal-fired power plants and its growing demand for oil.
Environmental chemistry professor Scot T. Martin, meanwhile, will seek to develop a tool to monitor health of the Amazon rainforest. Four researchers from the School of Public Health and the Medical School will study Harvard’s dining halls to find ways to improve nutrition and reduce environmental impact.
Examining climate change from a humanities perspective, History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes and postdoctoral fellow Geoffrey J.S. Supran’s project, “Envisaging the Fossil Fuel-Free Future,” supports a fellowship for writing “fact-based fiction” on environmental issues.
The fund will accept applications for the 2017-18 round of grants later this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month after two Harvard physicists published results detailing the synthesis of the first-ever sample of solid metallic hydrogen, the researchers have lost the sample after trying to further analyze it.
In late January, Isaac F. Silvera and Ranga P. Dias—a Harvard physics professor and postdoctoral researcher respectively—published their discovery of the potential “superconductor,” which could transform the way electricity is conducted. In a paper in the journal Science, they wrote that under extreme pressure and at low temperatures they were able to transform a hydrogen sample into a solid state—a discovery that has eluded scientists for over 80 years.
The team decided to keep the single sample they created in the diamond anvil cell—the apparatus used for the experiment—until their findings were published. After their research was released in Science, they planned on sending the sample to Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago where it could be further studied.
However, before shipping the sample, the researchers decided to conduct a few more analyses. But a test to measure the pressure of the hydrogen went awry.
“We decided that before transporting [the sample] we should measure the pressure because we have specialized apparatus that they may not have,” Silvera said. “Four months earlier we had measured the pressure with a laser and it was fine…We again shined much less laser power into the sample and the diamonds instantaneously broke. We could hear it click. It’s not mysterious, it’s the way experiments end.”
Alexander Drozdov, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, wrote in an email that “disappearing” samples are fairly common in the field.
“When you unload the cell and decrease pressure diamonds will be totally broken. Sometimes we can open the cell and observe just a lot of dust and no diamond at all. It is impossible to find any 10 microns sample in this heap of dust.”
After Silvera and Dias published their findings, several leading physicists questioned the sample's legitimacy. Eugene Gregoryanz, a high-pressure physicist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, wrote in an email that since the sample has lasted for so long—more than five months—it is an indication that is it not in fact solid hydrogen.
“If they had hydrogen as the sample it would have broke months and months before,” Gregoryanz wrote. “Since they kept it for 5-6 months demonstrates that it was not hydrogen—hydrogen at high pressures diffuses out within a day or two.”
Gregoryanz and Drozdov agreed that the experiment must be repeated to prove its validity. Silvera said he plans to attempt to replicate the experiment with a different type of diamond.
In response to the continued disputes over the validity of the findings, Silvera remains confident that the group did, however briefly, have the world’s only sample of solid metallic hydrogen.
“So the diamonds failed in our diamond cell. It could still be there, we just don’t know. Or it could’ve converted into a gas of molecular hydrogen. We just don’t know,” Silvera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 7, 2017 at 3:14 p.m.
Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group currently suing Harvard for allegedly discriminating against Asian American students in its College admissions processes, launched a new website Thursday to recruit students for a similar lawsuit at the University of Texas at Austin.
According to the website, UTnotFair.com, SFFA believes that “the University of Texas at Austin is unconstitutionally discriminating on the basis of race in its admissions process” and plans to “end this discrimination by challenging this process in the courts.”
SFFA’s new website closely mirrors HarvardnotFair.org, a website created in 2014 by SFFA president Edward Blum to recruit students rejected by the College for the then-nascent lawsuit against Harvard.
UT Austin faced allegations of racial discrimination in its admissions practices in two cases filed by  Abigail N. Fisher—and spearheaded by Edward Blum—that reached the United States Supreme Court. Harvard filed an impassioned amicus brief in the second Fisher case, urging the Court to continue allowing universities to consider race in admissions.
The Supreme Court upheld UT Austin's affirmative action processes in 2016.
Cory R. Liu, the new volunteer executive director of SFFA, said the organization believed it was worthwhile to attempt another lawsuit against UT Austin, this time centering on the way the school’s admissions practices consider Asian American applicants.
“As an Asian American, I felt there was an angle that wasn’t really being discussed much in the media and by the judges,” Liu said. “Just talking to people that I know, a lot of Asian Americans and a lot of high school students know exactly what the issue is about and they’re excited about another opportunity to bring this issue to court.”
But Matthew M. Cregor, an attorney representing the group of students defending Harvard’s policies in its current lawsuit, questioned SFFA’s new suit.
“They sure seem to be thinking that the third time must be the charm,” Cregor said.
Harvard and SFFA are currently gathering evidence to be used in their ongoing lawsuit. In Oct. 2016, Harvard notified hundreds of thousands of applicants to the College that their “academic, extracurricular, demographic, and other information” would become part of the lawsuit.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 7, 2017
A previous version of this article indicated that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the University of Texas at Austin in both Fisher I and Fisher II. To clarify, the Court remanded Fisher I to a circuit court, which then ruled in favor of UT Austin.

About two dozen students gathered at Harvard Law School for a conversation with James Wharton, a Conservative member of the United Kingdom’s Parliament and advocate for the U.K.'s exit from the European Union.
Organized by the Law School Dean of Students’ office and international groups like the European Law Association and China Law Association, the talk was part of a discussion series from the Law School’s Journal on Legislation.
Wharton spoke to attendees about his role in "Brexit," the June vote that decided the U.K. should leave the EU, a political and economic union of 28 European nations, of which 19 share a common currency.
Wharton said he proposed the referendum question to Parliament in May 2013, long before leaving the EU was a mainstream proposal. After the bill did not pass in the House of Lords, Wharton blamed obstructionism from opposing political parties. Then in May 2015, Wharton said, former British Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to announce a referendum vote would take place the following year.
In June 2016, 52 percent of voters in a British referendum voted to leave the EU, with some citing a desire to assert the United Kingdom’s independence and to curb immigration from other countries. Cameron announced he would resign shortly after the referendum, and the move will likely reverberate through the economies of the United Kingdom, remaining EU countries, and the United States.
Wharton said that although he expected the talk to focus on comparing British and American politics, he was pleased to advise students on the role of law in creating a more just society.
“[The message I wanted to give], particularly for those who are going to be lawyers, to be judges, to be leaders of industry, this is a place that creates some of the leaders of the future,” he said.
Law students who attended the talk said that even though they had their own opinions about Brexit, they felt that there was value in knowing about different perspectives on British and European politics.
“I think that it is very valuable, even as a [British citizen] studying in the US, to get a British perspective on British and European politics on this side of the Atlantic,” said Samantha R.E. Henderson, a Law School student. “I think that is valuable for the U.S. audience and for a Brit who has been away from Britain for some time now to hear about the developments there.”
Matteo Mantoani, a visiting Ph.D. student from the University of Cambridge, said he disagreed with Wharton’s reasoning, and that Brexit is not in the best interest of the British people or the rest of Europe.
Mantoani called the Brexit decision purely “political,” and said that the country is not prepared to finalize a split from the EU.
“There wasn’t anything planned [in regards to the Leave decision],” Mantoani said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A student-led petition to eliminate Thursday "community night" dining hall restrictions in upperclassmen Houses has garnered hundreds of signatures, with some students saying the rule presents an inconvenience.
The restrictions prohibit students from dining outside of their own Houses on Thursday evenings. They extend to all Houses, with the exception of Currier House.
The College's Office of Student Life implemented the restrictions in 2014 in an effort to boost House spirit. Some students note that although the restrictions are good in intention, they are often a hassle to navigate.
College administrators said at the time that although the restrictions "restrict choice and convenience," they ultimately aim to increase students' "sense of belonging" to their Houses.
Still, students said they feel limited by the policy.
“I have a lot of meetings on Thursdays and I’m in the Yard for most of the evening so it would be so nice for me to able to go and eat in Quincy, but unfortunately, with the restrictions, I can’t,” said Zahra Rawji ’19, who lives in Dunster House.
To channel his dismay with the Community Night restrictions, Joel W. Bateman ‘17, a resident of Kirkland House, created an online petition to draw attention to student frustrations over the policy and bring an end the policy.
“Honestly, I really just threw up a Google Form on Facebook on a whim because it was a Thursday night and I was frustrated,” Bateman said.
According to Bateman, the petition received 275 signatures without any effort to publicize.
“A lot of the comments speak volumes to the problems that Community Night causes,” Bateman said. He added he found a lot of complaints from Quad House residents who wish to eat in River Houses on Thursdays.
While he has not directly pursued the issue with College administration, Bateman said that Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 has access to the petition and has offered to bring the subject up at the Council's next meeting with College administrators. Sachee did not respond to requests for comment.
Bateman suggested potential alternatives to the current Thursday restrictions, including reverting to an old system in which Houses restrict dining hall access on different nights throughout the week.
“I wouldn’t be opposed to a system where people are assigned to a certain table and you get to meet new people in your House, because I’d really love to get to know more people,” Rawji said. “However, right now, the policy just ends up being an inconvenience to most.”

UPDATED: March 7, 2017 at 4:27 p.m. 
Dunster Faculty Deans Roger B. Porter and Ann R. Porter will step down from the head of the House in June after 16 years, the two announced Monday.
Roger Porter joined the Kennedy School as a professor in 1977 after serving in the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan; he later worked for George H.W. Bush. Prior to the couple’s appointment as House Masters, Ann Porter worked in the United States Senate.
Roger Porter, who teaches the popular Government 1540: “The American Presidency” said his departure from Dunster coincides with sabbatical leave from the University.
During the 2014-2015 academic year, the Porters oversaw the first full renovation of Harvard’s ongoing House Renewal project to modernize the upperclassmen residential Houses. A renovated Dunster House opened with fanfare in August 2015.
Both Faculty Deans said they enjoyed their nearly two decades at Dunster’s helm.
“Very quickly we fell in love with the students, and the opportunity to build a community committed to excellence, mutual respect, and genuine concern,” Roger and Ann Porter wrote in an email to Dunster affiliates Monday morning.  “We can honestly say that we have enjoyed this experience every day and every week.”
The couple said they will miss leading Dunster House and interacting with students.
“We have been so blessed to be able to spend time and rub shoulders with students and to learn from them and to observe them,” Ann Porter said. “We’ve enjoyed watching how students support and help each other.”
At times, their tenure as the House’s leaders was marked by controversy when students expressed concerns about the lack of support for BGLTQ students in Dunster. Criticisms over the absence of BGLTQ-identifying tutors in the House were reported as early as 2004. The House subsequently increased its BGLTQ-related programming, established a formal budget for such events, and hired tutors who identified as BGLTQ.
In an interview Monday, Roger Porter said he and his wife were grateful for the House’s inclusive environment and BGLTQ events.
“We have encouraged them in holding lots of events and we have attended all that we could,” he said. “We encourage everyone to come and we want them to be open events.”
The Porters’ departure will leave Dunster with several vacancies to fill in the fall as the College also continues its search for the House’s new resident dean, after former resident dean Carlos A. Diaz-Rosillo left Harvard in January to work in the Trump administration. Mather House is also searching for new Faculty Deans to replace Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten after they announced plans to depart in November.
After stepping down as Faculty Deans, the couple said they plan to travel and spend more time with their grandchildren. Roger Porter said that he intends to continue teaching after his sabbatical and remain involved with Dunster House as a Faculty Dean emeritus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard Law School administrator Darris M. Saylors was arraigned in Cambridge District Court last week, beginning court proceedings involving her and one other former Law School administrator accused of stealing more than $100,000 from the school between 2012 and 2013.
Along with Saylors, Margaret DeMarco, the Director of Student Affairs at the Law School until 2013, has been accused of improperly using Law School funds for personal purposes while an employee. DeMarco is set to appear in court for her arraignment on April 5.
Saylors, who worked as a staff assistant at the Law School until 2013, is accused of purchasing $47,793.66 worth of electronics, clothing, DVDs, and other items using money primarily from the budget for the accommodation of students with disabilities, according to court documents. DeMarco is accused of purchasing $62,832.90 worth of electronics and other items, also primarily from the budget for the accommodation of students with disabilities.
Last week’s arraignment begins a legal process that could last months. Though the alleged thefts concluded in 2013, Arthur L. Kelly, Saylors’ attorney, said charges weren’t filed until 2015 in the Waltham District Court. Those charges were later withdrawn, and with new charges filed in Cambridge District Court Feb. 10. Police were conducting interviews for the investigation as recently as May 2016.
“[The Waltham District Court] charges were filed and then withdrawn and I can’t tell you whether they were withdrawn at the behest of Harvard University, or the District Attorney’s office, or both,” Kelly said.
Elizabeth Vlock, a spokesperson for the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office, said they were not involved in the Waltham Court filings.
Law School spokesperson Robb London said the Law School declined to comment beyond the school’s initial statement last week.
In interviews with the police, Saylors alleged that the former Law School Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove encouraged her to attribute purchases to the budget for accommodating student with disabilities in order to avoid going over budget in other areas. Cosgrove wrote in an email that she only told employees to attribute purchases to that fund if it could be categorized multiple budget areas, writing that the disabilities budget was more flexible.
“There are times that an expense can logically be charged to two separate budgets,” Cosgrove wrote. “For instance, if we hired a sign language interpreter for commencement, I could see the charges being applied to the commencement budget or the disability budget. In cases such as that, my preference was to use the disabilities budget and I direct staff to do that.”
Saylors also alleged that DeMarco and Cosgrove had “created a climate where purchases where it was OK to treat yourself on occasion,” according to court documents. Cosgrove wrote that she played no role in Saylors’ alleged thefts.
“I never encouraged or condoned stealing,” Cosgrove wrote. “I'm confident that the investigations conducted by Harvard and the police were thorough and the actions were limited to the accused.”
DeMarco could not be reached for comment.
Saylors pre-trial conference is scheduled for April 20.

Cambridge City Councillors voted unanimously Monday night to support the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts’s calls for the state to withdraw from a federal customs enforcement training program that looks to tighten immigration enforcement state-wide.
The program in question, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287 (g) program, may deputize state and local law enforcement officers to function as federal immigration officers. City Councillors cited President Donald Trump's anti-immigration executive orders as the main motivation for their action and criticized federal attempts to delegate immigration enforcement responsibilities to state and county law enforcement officers.
“That’s not our police force’s job to go out and enforce those regulations,” Councillor Craig A. Kelley said at the meeting.
Cambridge is one of hundreds of U.S. cities deemed a “sanctuary” for undocumented immigrants. Councillors took time to reaffirm the city’s “sanctuary” status and spoke in support of protecting undocumented immigrants living in the City.
“We’ve always been proud of being a sanctuary city,” Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said. “It’s not enough to just say we’re a sanctuary city but we have to resist and push back against the hatred that’s coming out of the White House.”
The Councillors also voted unanimously to establish the Richard C. Rossi Housing Assistance Fund in recognition of the efforts of the recently retired City Manager. In a letter to the City Council, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale applauded Rossi’s dedication “to the creation and preservation of affordable housing and improving access to affordable housing in Cambridge.” The fund received an initial deposit of $35,641.46 comprised of donations received during the fall of 2016
“This will go a long way in helping folks,” Rossi said, thanking the council and Cantabrigians for their support in providing affordable housing.
Councillors also requested that the City Ordinance Committee invite all landowners in Alewife to a hearing about the future of zoning in the area. Councillors asked the committee to go over previous changes to zoning requirements in the area and to ensure residents have a voice in further changes and development projects moving forward.
“I’ve heard from some of them they’ve not been particularly engaged," City Councillor Leland Cheung said.
Also at the meeting, the Council advocated increasing speed limit signage in the City following the recent city-wide decrease to a speed limit of 25 miles per hour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The family of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia will donate his legal and academic papers to the Harvard Law School Library, the Law School announced Monday.
The papers derive primarily from Scalia’s time on the Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but also from his earlier work in the U.S. Department of Justice and in other roles.
Papers from his years on the Supreme Court and D.C. Appeals court will be made available for study starting in 2020. But documents related to specific cases will be withheld for the duration of the other ruling judges’ and justices’ lifetimes, according to the Law School's announcement. The documents will be added to the Law School Library’s Modern Manuscripts collection, which features the papers of a number of other prominent legal scholars and Supreme Court Justices.
“We are extraordinarily grateful to the family of Justice Scalia for donating these papers to the Harvard Law School Library,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said in the press release. “His papers will be a tremendous resource for students, scholars, and the general public for generations to come.”
Scalia, who graduated magna cum laude from the Law School in 1960, served as an editor of the Law Review during his time as a student. He was known for his strict interpretation of the Constitution and tendency toward more conservative rulings. Scalia died in February 2016, and his seat on the court has remained vacant since. In February, President Donald Trump nominated another Law School graduate, Neil M. Gorsuch, to the Court. He is currently awaiting his Senate hearings, and, if confirmed, is expected to take a similar constitutional approach as Scalia.

The recommendations strengthening the College's policy penalizing members of single-gender social organizations has prompted both skepticism and praise among some of the Harvard affiliates affected by the expanded guidelines.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted a number of recommendations Monday, including tasking the Honor Council with helping enforce the College’s policy and increasing list of fellowships ineligible to members of single-gender groups. These suggestions formed part of a larger report issued by a committee tasked with recommending how to implement the College’s penalties on single-gender social groups.
The policy, slated to take effect next fall, will bar members of final clubs and Greek organizations from receiving certain fellowships, holding athletic captaincies, and maintaining leadership positions in student groups.
Honor Council member Jake H. Hummer ’17 said he first learned that the Council will be involved with the policy’s enforcement after Khurana’s College-wide announcement Monday afternoon.
“I don’t believe that any undergraduates on the Council were consulted about expanding their role to this,” Hummer said in an interview Monday. “I have heard nothing about this, and I consider myself to be in a leadership position on the Council, so if I haven’t heard of it, I’d be surprised if anyone else has.”
Multiple other members of the Honor Council did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Hummer said he “completely disagreed” with the report’s suggestion that the Honor Council assume responsibility for disciplining some students in violation of the College’s policy. According to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, the Council will reprimand members of final clubs and Greek organizations who apply for fellowships barred by the policy.
“If I had known this would be my role on the Honor Council, I would not have joined,” Hummer said.
The report also suggested that The Crimson and the Undergraduate Council be subject to the College’s policy, meaning members of final clubs and Greek organizations—starting with the Class of 2021—would be unable to hold leadership positions in those groups. But Khurana did not immediately accept that recommendation, writing in his email that the proposal required “further deliberation.”
In four of the past five years, at least one UC President or Vice President has been a member of a final club or Greek organization.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, a member of the all-female Bee Club, and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 declined to comment on the committee’s recommendations, but said they will release a full statement Tuesday morning. President of The Crimson Derek K. Choi ’18 said he was pleased with Khurana’s decision.
“Dean Khurana's email correctly acknowledges The Crimson’s longstanding legal, financial, and institutional separation from the College,” Choi said.
Adams House representative Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 was glad Khurana did not immediately accept the recommendation that the UC be subject to the College’s policy.
“This is a big decision to make,” Whittaker said. “He’s got the right move to wait, just because this is a very important decision to make.”
UC treasurer Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said he does not support penalizing students in single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations who seek UC positions.
“I, right now, believe that anyone should be able to be representative of their peers. So if I was going to make a decision right now, I would say that anyone should be able to be elected to the UC, in my opinion,” he said.
Former UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, a former member of the Delta Gamma sorority, also said she opposes the implementation committee's recommendation.
“I really disagree with their recommendation,” she said. “This is the breakdown of government, in a sense, like, if people cannot participate in their government, then who does the government really represent?”
Richard T. Porteus, Jr. ’78 , the graduate board president of the all-male Fly Club, said he was particularly “intrigued” by the report’s suggestion that certain student groups transitioning from single-gender to coed status be required to publish demographic breakdowns of their membership.
“That sounds incredibly invasive and it’s not something that is being applied to Harvard’s recognized activities,” Porteus said. “Is Harvard going to provide the same sociodemographic information regarding the members of its polo team?”
“If Harvard is going to put demands on social organizations then it should expand why it’s not carrying that same test to all of its activities,” Porteus said.

Former President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou discussed his experience in public service and reaffirmed Taiwan’s commitment to improving relations with mainland China at a lecture at the Law School's Austin Hall on Monday.
Throughout, Ma commented on the complexity of the diplomatic situation between China and Taiwan and both nations’ intent to maintain friendly relations. The talk, which was co-sponsored by the East Asian Legal Studies program and Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, brought more than one hundred attendees.
“When I took office on May 20th, 2008, in my inaugural address, I made it very clear in terms of our foreign policy that I want to maintain the status quo of no reunification, no independence, no use of force under the framework of the Republic of China Constitution,” Ma said.
In 2015, Ma met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking the first meeting between leaders from the two nations since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.
He went on to further elaborate on his administration’s stance on China.
“We will not support the idea of independent Taiwan because there is no such need of independence,” he said. “Have you ever heard any country that claims independence twice? We already were an independent country back in 1912. If we do it again, where do we get independence from?”
When asked to comment on the future of the China-Taiwan relationship, Ma responded that he hopes for peaceful “cross-strait relations” and pointed to efforts he made while in office to foster exchange between Chinese and Taiwanese students.
In response to a question from an audience member, Ma mentioned the conditions necessary for the reunification of China and Taiwan.
“The people of Mainland and the people of Taiwan should both agree on reunification, particularly the people of Taiwan,” Ma said. “We have lived in a democratic society for so long. We elect our own president, we elect the members of our parliament, and we run our own business.”
The talk was followed by a question and answer session, during which Ma recounted his time at the Law School, where he recieved a degree in 1981.
“I didn’t know when I attended Harvard Law School I could become the President,” he said. “I studied law here, just like I studied law back in Taiwan. I wanted to make my country based on the rule of law.”
“The reason I spent so much time and energy to attract more students to come to Taiwan is so that young people of the two sides can make friends at early stages in their lives,” he said. “When these students are in a position to make decisions, they will think about their friends in Taiwan.”

Facebook founder and Harvard dropout Mark E. Zuckerberg will return to campus to speak at the University’s 366th commencement ceremony, the University announced Tuesday.
Zuckerberg will address graduates during the Afternoon Exercises of Commencement, which will take place in Tercentenary Theatre on May 25.
He founded Facebook while a sophomore in Kirkland House in 2004 before dropping out to focus full-time on the social media company, which is now worth more than $300 billion.  Widely considered one of the wealthiest and most powerful people alive, Zuckerberg has pledged to donate many of his earnings to humanitarian causes.
“Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership has profoundly altered the nature of social engagement worldwide. Few inventions in modern times can rival Facebook in its far-reaching impact on how people around the globe interact with one another,” University President Drew G. Faust told the Harvard Gazette.
As an undergraduate, though, Zuckerberg did not curry the same favor among administrators. Prior to creating Facebook, Zuckerberg faced the College’s Administrative Board for creating facemash.com, a website allowing Harvard students to rate their peers by “hotness” using ID photos taken from College student directories.
After surviving the Ad Board, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a website meant to replace what were then House-specific directories.
Over a decade later and at the head of one of the largest technology companies in the world, Zuckerberg has pledged tens of billions of dollars to a range of charities and causes. With his wife Priscilla Chan ’07, Zuckerberg has committed to donating 99 percent of his Facebook shares, including more than $3 billion over the next decade to prevent and cure diseases.
“The Social Network,” a 2010 film in which Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg, immortalized Zuckerberg’s rise to fame.
Zuckerberg, who is 32, is the youngest Commencement speaker selected in recent history. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg implored graduates to follow their “intuition” at last year’s ceremony, while former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 spoke during the Afternoon exercises in 2015.
But Zuckerberg is neither the first Harvard dropout nor first tech billionaire to speak at Harvard’s graduation exercises: Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft, spoke at Commencement in 2007.

Saturday’s two matches for the Harvard women’s tennis team could not have been more different, but both managed to end in the Crimson’s favor. After fighting tooth and nail with St. John’s in the day’s first showdown, Harvard dominated Bryant in the afternoon.
The victories over the Red Storm (9-2, 3-0 Big East), a team that has already beaten Yale and DePaul, and Bulldogs (0-7) pushed the Crimson’s win streak to three as the team (7-5) prepares for its final two matches before a spring break trip to Santa Barbara, Calif. Irene Lu led the charge for Harvard, winning both of her singles matches on the day.
“Irene has a lot of natural power and she’s still learning the game,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “She started later compared to a lot of her other freshmen. Right now she’s working on her routine and her shot selection and that really paid off for her this weekend. She came out of the blocks firing and got us on the board early.”
HARVARD, 4, BRYANT, 0
After struggling to win the doubles point for the early part of the spring season, the Crimson appeared to be turning a corner against the Bulldogs. For the second time in three matches, Harvard won all three doubles matches to secure the all-important point. The team has won the doubles point in each of its last three matches.
“We’ve been focusing on doubles a lot at practice,” captain June Lee said. “When we’re playing points and doing drills, we’re setting certain parameters that we have to follow. We’ve really been focusing on being the team that makes the first move or mixes it up before the other team does.”
Sophomore Erica Oosterhout and captain June Lee, the Crimson’s top two singles players and its top doubles pair on Saturday, beat Bryant’s Marion Bouillin and Ryan Brown. The freshman duo of Lu and Natasha Gonzalez won all six of its games against juniors Ashanti Campfield and Nina Luiggi. Harvard first-year Jenna Friedel had the singles portion of the match off but teamed up with sophomore Isabel Jasper to down Stephanie Arroyo and Briana Leonard.
Only needing three more wins to clinch the match, the Crimson made sure got out of the Murr Center in a jiffy. Lee beat Bouillin for the second time, this time at second singles, 6-1, 6-1. Lu picked up her second singles victory of the afternoon by taking it to Luiggi in 12 of their 13 games. Gonzalez brought home the win for Harvard after blowing away Brown, 6-0, 6-3.
HARVARD, 4, ST. JOHN’S, 3
All three doubles matches to begin Saturday came down to the wire. Oosterhout and Lee fell at No. 1 to Jessica Livianu and Anna Morozova. The Crimson’s second and third duos were able to pick up the slack to give Harvard the win. Gonzalez and Lu did not show their age against the experienced European duo of Olaya Inclan Solis and Zofia Stanisz, 7-5. Friedel and doubles specialist Sabrina Xiong edged Stephanie Elgegren and Jaide Collins, 6-4.
“We’re doing a lot more fast-paced drills at practice and the biggest change is our mentality,” Green said. I think our players are a lot more aggressive-minded and our shot selection has definitely improved under pressure so those things have brought us closer [to where we want to be].”
One of the bigger storylines from the match with the Red Storm was the fact that Oosterhout lost her first match since Jan. 29 against Florida State. The Tampa, Fla. native had won her last five matches, all from the No. 1 spot and many coming in dominating fashion.
Gonzalez fell to Inclan Solis, 6-4, 6-1, at the No. 5, but two key wins from the lower part of the ladder ultimately lifted the Crimson. Lu dominated Stanisz, 6-1, 6-0, at the No. 4 while Xiong, playing in just her second singles match of the season remained unbeaten after topping Irina Preotescu, 6-1, 6-2.
“[She] had a really solid singles match,” Lee said. “She was feeling confident and she’s been working with the coaches. She’s been working really hard on improving her back hand and coming into the net and being aggressive so that obviously paid off and gave us a point there that we needed.”
Two of the morning’s six singles matches came down to the third set. After falling to Lee in the first set, senior Anna Morozova took each of the next two sets, 6-3, 6-3 to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Friedel got revenge at No. 3 in her three-set duel, edging Elgegren, 6-2, 6-7, 6-2.
“We were looking forward to a battle and it definitely was a battle,” Green said. “The singles matches were very tight, everyone left everything they had on the court. Fortunately, it went our way. I think this will give us a lot of momentum going forward and it definitely helped us to start against Bryant.”

Harvard freshman Gina Kennedy claimed the 2017 Women's Individual Championship in stunning fashion, upsetting overwhelming favorite and two-time national finalist Reeham Sedky of Penn, by a score of 3-1.
The Briton dropped just one game in four matches this past weekend en route to the 17th individual national championship in program history. The Crimson has produced more individual collegiate champions than any other school,  also boasting 17 Women's National Team Championships.
Harvard's No. 1, sophomore Sabrina Sobhy, decided against traveling to the individual championships, content to rest with the National Team Championship in hand.  Penn's Sedky beat Sobhy twice earlier in the year in battles widely-regarded as matchups between the top two players in collegiate squash. After Sobhy's rain check. the path to the title was even more feasible for Sedky, aptly nicknamed The Hammer. Harvard's No. 2 player, the second-seeded Kennedy, would prove to be a stubborn nail.
Breezing through the first round of play, Kennedy then faced former British junior national teammate and fellow freshman Lucy Beecroft of Yale. Familiarity usually breeds competition, but Kennedy silenced that thought with a clean three-game win--choppings.
The Beckenham, U.K. native faced Penn’s No. 3 junior Marie Stephan in Saturday afternoon's semifinal match. Kennedy coasted to a 3-0 victory.
“I actually went into the match against Marie Stephan quite relaxed because I’d never beaten her before…It had really helped having seen Kayley [Leonard] play Marie in the previous weeks and having her there to help me through because she has a great game against Marie Stephan,” Kennedy said.
In the tournament finale, Kennedy jumped to a quick one-game lead. Kennedy's poise was on full display down 4-8 in the second game with all signs pointing to Sedky regaining her form and staving off an upset bid. But the Quaker could not sustain her rally. Kennedy would win the game 11-9.
“After winning the first game it gave me a little bit of belief that I could compete with this girl. So when I went 8-4 down I was just trying to reset and think about the positives that came from the game before and to focus on my game plan, which was to just absorb the pressure of her hard-hitting,” Kennedy said.
As the possibility of an upset materialized, the game became more deliberate and dramatic. Sedky stumbled and hurt her knee, play resumed, and she built a three-point lead, only for Kennedy to even the score at 8-all. This time Sedky managed to close out the Crimson rookie, winning the game 11-9.
Kennedy, whose play was defined by finesse and agility, grabbed an early lead in the fourth game. Her play kept The Hammer (read: Fisher-Price Hammer) off-balance, limiting Sedky's hard-drives. Stifled in play, Sedky decided to take her aggression out on her racket. Equipment issues persisted as Kennedy accidentally struck her foe’s protective eyewear and a second injury timeout ensued.
Sedky had shown the ability to battle through misfortune the night before when she faced the Crimson’s No. 3 sophomore Kayley Leonard in an equally contentious match. Leonard earned a game ball in the first period, but struggled to close out the game and her opponent pounced on the opportunity to win in three games. Nevertheless, her advice about Sedky was instrumental in Kennedy’s success. She would win the deciding game 11-7 to win the Ramsey Cup.
Kennedy combined with junior Alyssa Mehta, who captured an individual title of her own, winning the Holleran South Championship in three games against Stanford senior CC Ho.
“Even though squash is an individual sport, the fact that you have your teammates out there supporting you, it makes it feel more like a team sport,” Mehta said. “It was nice to be at Dartmouth for the weekend, and to support my teammates who were also playing because although it is an individual tournament, we are still playing to represent Harvard."
Mehta breezed through her bracket, dropping just one game along the way to freshman teammate Eleonore Evans, claiming Second Team All-American honors along the way.

You may have read our post a few years back about Joe Biden's...attractiveness when he was young. We might have found someone even more attractive.
It’s true: Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau—while he is certainly a very accomplished politician—is also quite accomplished in the looks department.
Unlike many of us who had that awkward puberty stage and had to wait to “glow up,” It appears he has just always been this hot. So take a stare or two at his life as a hottie for your mid-afternoon study break:
He could have been your favorite FOP leader.
Or a lowkey member of the Advocate #hipster.
Or one of the only hot lifeguards at the MAC.
Or a member of the AD. We see you rocking that long-sleeved shirt and vest look.
Justin Trudeau, please let us know if you’ll be in the Boston area (aka visiting Harvard) anytime soon whether it be at an IOP event or just to hang out with President Faust. We Harvard students could certainly use the presence of an attractive, humble, and accomplished man.

You ever have one of those days when you can’t quite tell if something is satire or not? That’s what we’re going through right now. Normally you can check the source’s url—if it’s the Onion or some other funny-sounding publication, you can write it off as a joke and move on. But what happens when the source is the most prestigious university in the world? 

In case you missed it, the College’s Implementation Committee for the Policy on Membership in Single Gender Social Organizations (oh god we’re never writing that again) released its recommendations today. If you’re looking for a brief rundown of what’s in their report, check out this article from our main site. If you’re looking for a laugh, look no further:
“We recommend that the College undertake a three-year pilot program of inter-house dining societies, followed by an assessment...Here is how the program as a whole could work. Each society would be “adopted” or hosted by (generally) pairs of Houses, ideally with contrasting physical amenities. Each society would then meet (generally) weekly for a group meal in one or the other of its two host Houses (generally rotating between them)... Societies might set special themes for some of their meals, purchase special desserts, invite special guests, eat in elegant attire, read Chaucer out loud, or anything else they enjoy.” 
That has to be satire, right? We have definitely never been to a party where someone has been like “you know what this rager needs? Some English lit from the Middle Ages.”
That is not lit. Just ask Princeton.
Best response to the news so far? Someone in the comments section on the Crimson’s article about the report wrote that the members of the committee are “detached from all reality, or perhaps hostages desperately signaling for help.”
Don’t worry, folks! We’ll come save you from that good old ivory tower and invite you to a real party sometime soon. You have to promise to leave your Shakespeare anthologies at home.
But in all seriousness, please tell us the College just "Kesh'd" us. This can't be real.

The bunnies roving Leverett House's courtyard are not the only cool things about the house. The biggest upperclassmen house, with roughly 500 students, Leverett is full of unique quirks and surprises. Set right on the river with a view of the ridiculously photogenic Weeks Bridge, Leverett  is the perfect location for the budding freshman photographer or the varsity athlete. And if you’re looking for a pretty spacious suite, the Leverett towers are almost unrivaled amongst the river houses. Not only would incoming Leverett residents be getting one of the most newly renovated houses—they would be joining a community of students whose house pride is truly unmatched by any other house.

You’ll never run out of living options if you’re placed in Leverett House on Thursday. Sophomores can pick from suits in the Leverett Towers, the newly-renovated McKinlock Hall, or overflow housing in DeWolfe apartments. Lev’s F and G towers have large rooms with natural lighting and views of the Charles. The best part? Sophomores—unlike in some other houses—get to pick their rooms before they leave for the summer, so you’ll know what you’re getting into ahead of time. Steffan Paul ’19—one of the social chairs for Leverett's House Committee—said he currently lives in a suite with a “really unnecessarily big common room, two doubles and a single.” Sounds good to us!
Following the most recent renovations to the house in 2014, Leverett is replete with comfy study niches intended for both independent and group studying. According to House Committee chair Belle Lee ’18, the Leverett House Library—which also doubles as a theater space—is a great location to study because it’s quiet and has really good lighting. Lee said both of Lev’s towers are equipped with new Keurig machines, meaning you are likely to start nursing a healthy coffee addiction if you’re placed in this house.
Lev boasts one of the most enthusiastic house communities along the river. We took a walk through the house and chatted with some current House Committee members about the best parts of Leverett's house community:
What made you decide to run for HoCo?
BL: When I came in as a sophomore, the Lev HoCo was super friendly and they really made me and my block mates feel at home, and I just wanted to form a part of that community.
SP: I started last semester because I wanted to be on a team to organize things, and I kept on with it because it’s a really great community of people and they really care about the house.
What are your Steins like? 
Cynthia Kim '18: Our steins are very chill yet super fun and filled with energy. We usually have a theme with some awesome food, amazing drinks, and loud music. It’s a good time for the community to bond together while getting some time to unwind at the end of the week. The room is generally pretty packed and people hang around, eat, talk, drink, play pool, watch a sports game, sing and even occasionally dance. 
Still not sold on Leverett? We asked the ~hard~ questions to some HoCo members and regular house residents:
What would you tell freshmen who are looking to get into Leverett? 
BL: So first of all, I’ll tell all the freshman than any house they get is great, but if they’re lucky and they get Lev, there’s a lot of things they can look forward to. Being in the biggest house, you’ll meet a lot of new friends, so personally for me, I actually had a bunch of friends that I wasn’t able to block with, and they also got Lev just because, you know, probability and statistics. But apart from that, our staff at Lev is probably one of the best things about being in this house. Bonnie, our swiper, in the D-hall, remembers everyone’s names, she’s super friendly, and our building manager is very nice, very funny to talk to, and also our Faculty Deans, and Res deans and the tutors—there’s so many amazing tutors in Lev. And anytime you have a question, it doesn’t even have to be pre-career, or anything related to your concentration, the tutors in your entryway are always there.
What do you think makes your house special?
BL: We have amazing river views in the towers. Literally starting from any of the floors, you can see the sunset on the river, and I love that. Also if you’re in McKinlock, access to the D-hall is super nice when it’s snowing outside, and DeWolfe always is a preferred site with big doubles and a nice common room. But apart from that, I would say the location of Lev is great. It’s right next to Week’s Bridge, so if you want to go over to the stadium or anything for any of our big games like Harvard-Yale, it’s super easy to go to and just being on the river it’s sort of like an in between distance. It’s closer to the yard than Mather and I just think it’s very nice.
If you had to describe your house in 3 words what would they be?
Selena Rincon '17: Big, pretty, I'm really bad at this, sorry. Rabbits.
SP: Bunnies. Fucking. Everywhere.
James B. Jones '19: Please. Ignore. Steffan.
What is your best Leverett House memory?
SR: Housing Day was a lot of fun. They bring a little petting area for the bunnies so it’s really cute.
Can you talk about house spirit/community? 
Kaitlin Tse '19: It’s different than the freshman dorms, I can attest to this. In Annenberg you see all your peers in the same grade, which is great, but it’s not really an intimate connection. But in a house, you have that and it’s not just with freshmen but with upperclassmen as well.
If you had to change one thing about your house what would it be?
KT: The towers are very cell-like, so it's kind of like Canaday.
What is the biggest misconception about your house?
SP: That the towers are uncomfortable and ugly. The towers are great—they're fantastic.
Which superhero is your housemaster most similar to?
KT: Some kind of detective or someone with gadgets. He's a physics guy, so it's always physics night here.
What Hogwarts house would your house get sorted into?

When Alicia Keys sang “Concrete jungle where dreams are made of,” she probably wasn't just referencing New York, but Harvard's very own Mather House as well. While Mather—with its sharp Brutalist architecture—may stick out from the rest of the upperclassmen houses, it also stands out for its strong sense of house community, Happy Hours, #moresinglesmoresex and, well, a lot more.

Sophomores usually live in the Lowrise, which consists of singles and a common room shared with anywhere between four to six people. The common rooms are usually quite spacious and perfect for hosting parties. Seniors tend to live in the Tower, which has larger singles and amazing river views, but sometimes sophomores can get #blessed with a spot. Juniors and seniors lottery for housing in April, and while sophomore housing is assigned by the housing administrator over the summer, student roommate preference is taken into account.
Mather is a house with unparalleled community and spirit, which has prompted many, including House Committee co-chairs Lenny Murphy ’18 and Phillip Ramirez ’18, to get more involved with their house community. Freshmen assigned to Mather will have no shortage of events to look forward to, from Mather's Housing Day Happy Hour (what Mather HoCo fondly calls all of their Steins), where they order 30 pizzas every 30 minutes, to Mather Lather. There’s certainly a lot to look forward to. Murphy jokes that when he first came to Mather after getting his housing assignment, he got lost, but once he found the house, he was “blown away by the spirit of the students and the overall sense of community.”
“People might say that Mather is ugly, but the people are beautiful," Murphy said.
Housing Day is certainly a big day for Matherites—last year, Mather residents said they were actually late to the Yard because they were having such a good time bonding in their courtyard before they left. Aside from Mather’s whipped cream traditions and pizza Happy Hour, freshmen can look forward to all of the Mather Happy Hours (Valentine’s Day chocolate fondue Happy Hour, anyone?) in the Big TV room, watching sports games in the JCR, admiring the signed Conan O’Brien poster in the JCR, or just hanging out in the dining hall, which Ramirez describes as the “favorite chill spot of all Matherites…[with a] laid-back coffeeshop vibe, but with better views of the river.”
Besides Housing Day, Mather has a rich and exciting social life. From Mather Lather, pitched by Ramirez as “Cambridge’s annual foam party,” to ragers within Mather suites, it’s clear that Mather House is a social dorm. Mather was the first house to implement the Fast Track party registration system, and has also undergone minor renovations to make common areas more party-friendly, including replacing carpeted floors with tile floors.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House?
Curtis M. Hsu '19: The inside is more beautiful than the outside.
Matt W. Rodriguez '19: It will grow on you. Trust me.
Patrick R. Tan '18: The walls are very thin.
What superheroes are your faculty deans most similar to?
Phillip M. Ramirez '18: Doctor Mike is Batman, because he has all of his gadgets that he's always tinkering with. He's the hero we need, but not the one we deserve.
Lenny C. Murphy ’18: Christie is Superman, because she is great friends with Batman and they compliment each other very well.
What makes your house special?
CMH: Singles.
Claire A. Criscione '19: A view of the river that beats the view anywhere else.
Nina C. Srivastava ’18: The distance provides a sense of community that other river houses don’t have.
Tell us more about Mather Lather.
LCM: It’s just a dance party in a foam pit. People have a great time. I would like to say that people do not get communicable diseases. It is a very clean space, and if everyone says they have a rash, it is because soap is an abrasive substance.
Anything else we should know about Mather?
LCM: Oh! There is one double in the whole house. But you are never placed into it, you usually lottery for it. It’s a special room: instead of being on the third or fourth floor of the low rise, it’s at the very front of the house.

Few can find fault with Dunster. As the first house to be fully renewed, Dunster even smells new. Its wooden finish is impeccable and its paint untarnished. Some students may argue that the house’s appearance doesn’t compensate for its location as one of the river houses farthest away from the yard, or for the fact that many upperclassmen live in doubles. However, we think that if you’ve been given the opportunity to live in Dunster for the next three years, you can't go wrong.
Sophomores in Dunster are placed into one-room doubles or three-room quads in Dunster House. A select few will get overflow housing in DeWolfe. The upside of living in a house that was just recently renovated? The place looks like a freaking hotel, has a pretty stellar gym and a beautiful, grand dining hall (mini-Annenberg, in a way). For those sophomores that do end up in DeWolfe, expect to have air conditioning, in-suite kitchens and bathrooms, and spacious common rooms. While the house doesn’t exactly have a party suite, some of the larger suites—usually reserved for juniors and seniors—are large enough to host ragers in.
Dunster's House Committee Chairs Timothy Kang '18 and Jiho Park '18 answered our questions about the hotel-by-the-river's house community:
What are the best spots to chill in the house?
Oh boy, where do we start. Post-renovation Dunster has a plethora of spaces where you can get work done, hang out with friends, or meet new people. The Dunster Grille is an indispensable institution that unites the Dunster community late at night with delicious mozz sticks and chicken quesadillas. The Courtyard Lounge, Dining Hall, and Library are great study spaces, while Dunster’s numerous seminar rooms and floor common rooms provide great venues for watching Netflix, playing board games, and the like. The newly renovated basement gym is a great place to lift with friends, play squash or basketball, or go on a run without having to deal with the winter weather.
Describe the general house spirit.
Dunsterites are incredibly proud to call Dunster House their home. We’re incredibly blessed to have a newly renovated house with great facilities, and we all strive to build a welcoming community that continually challenges itself to grow as individuals. You’ll see us super pumped up and excited to welcome freshman into our home on Housing Day, and we’ll definitely make our presence known in the Yard that morning.
What type of Steins do you throw and what are the best events during the year?
HoCo usually hosts Stein Clubs every other Friday, and we try to switch up the theme every time we host it. For example, this year we’ve hosted Glow Stein, ValenStein, and Meet the Parents Stein. Other popular themes include Casino Night Stein, Luau Stein (held outside in our courtyard), and Karaoke Stein.
We also host small events between Stein Clubs like S’mores Night, Chocolate Bonanza, and Game Night. Our favorite large events are the Goat Roast (see below), Winter Wonderland, Hoe Down, and Spring Formal.
How do you do in IMs?
While Dunster House hasn’t won the Straus Cup in a very long time, our spirit is strong and unbroken. We’re led by a very dedicated and passionate IM War Council, and we have healthy interest among Dunsterites for participating in IMs. Our tennis team was undefeated last fall, and we’ve had some great showings in crew these past few years.
What’s the “go-to” event of the year?
Dunster’s go-to event of the year is definitely the Goat Roast, which is held in our beautiful courtyard every year in the spring. Every year, we drive out early in the morning to pick up the goat from a farm south of Boston, and Dunsterites help skin the goat using pieces of obsidian. HUDS helps us marinate the goat overnight, and we spit-roast the goat over a fire from morning until late afternoon. In the meantime, Dunsterites play football in the courtyard, have fun in bounce houses, and this year will enjoy a performance from a student band.
We chatted with a trio of sophomores about their experience in the house. Here's what they had to say:
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your house?
Zahra Rawji '19: “You get your own bathroom if you live in DeWolfe. The gym is amazing—it inspires you to work out.
If you had to describe your house in 3 words what would they be? 
Aidan Connaughton '19: “The best, the best, the best”
What is your favorite Dunster House memory? 
Ben Kruteck: Getting into the house on housing day and getting stormed in my freshman dorm, and also gloating to everyone else that you got the best house on campus.
What is the biggest misconception that exists about your house? 
Sruthi Muluk '19: It’s not that far, and there’s a shuttle every ten minutes.
If you had to change one thing about your house what would it be? 
SM: More rooms with common rooms and singles.
If you had to liken your house to a fruit, what fruit would it be and why?
AC: Strawberry because strawberries are good all the way through...very aesthetically pleasing...”
SM: “...and they’re sweet, like everyone in Dunster, and they’re red like our bell tower”
