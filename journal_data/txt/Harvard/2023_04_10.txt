After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Langston Hughes’ poem “Harlem,” he famously meditates on the question: “What happens to a dream deferred?” Hughes implies that even when faced with systemic neglect, dreams attempt to “explode” forward. No obstacle of delay, regardless of magnitude, can stop one.
As long as we can dream, we will pursue them. So then, it stands to reason: The only way to stop a dream is to interrupt it.
Around 4:15 a.m. on April 3, the dreams of four Black Harvard students were interrupted.
That morning, armed Harvard University Police Department officers raided an undergraduate suite in Leverett House in response to a false 911 call. After more than 48 hours of silence on the matter, Dean Rakesh Khurana sent an email around 10 p.m. on April 5 to the Harvard undergraduate body. The email conveyed a sense of trepidation within the Harvard community, noting that any incident of this kind dispenses “implications, fears, and trauma” in a way that hits close to home for a lot of students of color.
For Black students, those anxieties stem from a violent history of Black dreams being interrupted. But despite this history, the word Black cannot be found once in the entire email.
Although it certainly existed earlier, this historical trauma can be traced back to the Ku Klux Klan. The first iteration of the KKK was founded shortly after the end of the Civil War to terrorize minorities. Then began their night rides. The White supremacist group would ride at night, in armed gangs, raiding Black home after Black home with the sole intention of instilling fear.
A message was clear: There was to be no sanctuary or retreat found in Black homes. Black families were left restless by the onslaught, staying on guard and depriving themselves of sleep for fear of violence. There was no time and no place to dream.
Fast forward to the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, pronounced to the whole world that he had a dream. His words helped to launch a renaissance, brimming with hope: His dream was partially realized in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
But this progress didn’t stop the cycle of interruption plaguing Black dreams. On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated.
At the same time, Black Power organizations like the Black Panther Party sought to create spaces for Black dreams to flourish through active resistance. However, this movement was met with the same response. Around 4:30 a.m. on December 4, 1969, 14 armed Chicago police officers raided the home of Hampton and fired over 90 bullets at a sleeping 21-year-old Fred Hampton — murdering him.
This pattern doesn’t end in the 1960s. Just three years ago, on March 13, 2020, a little past midnight, at least seven police officers in Louisville, Kentucky used a battering ram to execute a no-knock raid at the apartment of Breonna Taylor. Her residence was breached. 32 rounds were fired. And in the comfort of her own home, Breonna Taylor was killed.
The swatting attack that took place this past Monday was not an isolated incident — it can be strung together with a lengthy history of disturbances to Black dreams. The waking terror of having our dreams interrupted has followed us to the present.
Always prevented from getting rest, overworked Black bodies grow tired. Long-term patterns of fractured sleep caused by unease have been shown to lead to adverse physical and mental health effects. The basic object of sleep has become restricted. The harm has been done.
Dreams are revolutionary. The imagination spurred from rest manifests into tangible inspiration. It would not be a stretch to say dreams shape America’s reality. In fact, the foundation of America is a dream. The American Dream contends that prosperity can be achieved through determination and hard work.
Yet, it is apparent that not everyone in America is allowed to dream.
Time and time again, Black dreams are left unsettled. Under sheets and blankets, security should be expected, but only worry is found. The worry intrudes the mind and forces us to ask: Is the safety of my own home the next facade to fall?
Let us sleep. We just want to dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the early morning just last Monday, four students in Leverett House became the victims of swatting — the act of making an illegitimate emergency call designed to harass a target by provoking an armed police response. What resulted was a shocking and terrifying moment for all students on campus, and we recognize the profound trauma of those directly affected.
We join the Editorial Board in offering support to the four Black students that were woken up at gunpoint by Harvard University Police Department officers. We also agree with the Board’s call for a thorough and transparent investigation. And we similarly find the College’s lackluster support disappointing, and hope that they will overall address the situation more directly and openly.
However, the Editorial Board’s renewed criticism of HUPD and militarized policing is, in this case, misguided and detrimental to student safety.
We are concerned with the Board’s refusal to acknowledge the importance of a campus police presence, and its failure to imagine a scenario in which the threat that triggered the swatting was real. According to the update by HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay, the caller warned HUPD that they were armed, claimed that they had unsuccessfully attempted to kill a hostage, and threatened to shoot any responding officers. While the threat turned out to be a hoax, it was certainly credible. We are thankful HUPD took appropriate action.
As the Board has previously argued, we are the generation of mass shootings. While disturbing, it is not hard to imagine a mass shooting event on our own campus. In instances like these, it is necessary to have an appropriately armed and trained police force.
Beyond their flawed logic about police abolition, the Board fails to recognize that the abolition of HUPD would not remove police presence on campus, but rather largely replace HUPD with the Cambridge Police Department. The problems attributed by the Board to HUPD as a policing institution also exist within CPD and are in fact magnified by its relative unfamiliarity with Harvard’s community and campus. HUPD’s acute knowledge of College buildings and culture informed their response on April 3, in alerting officers to the caller’s familiarity with how Leverett rooms are colloquially referenced; this benefit, among others, would be lost were we to abolish Harvard’s police.
Furthermore, it appears that the University must have some level of recourse and oversight over its eponymous police force in HUPD. Although imperfect, this accountability would disappear if HUPD were abolished and CPD filled the policing void — making situations like the swatting at Leverett even less safe for all involved.
Ultimately, we reject the Board’s characterization of the swatting as a consequence of militarized policing. In fact, this incident demonstrates the need — especially at an institution like Harvard — for a police force that is familiar with the community and able to respond actively to threats of violence.
The caller bears full responsibility for the chain of events their call provoked. The trauma caused was the result of their actions alone. We hope that the caller will be punished appropriately, and that the affected students receive the support and acknowledgement they deserve from the University and the Harvard community. But faulting the existence of policing on campus for one swatter’s actions is like blaming medicine for the maladies it is prescribed to address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just last week, at least five armed Harvard University Police Department officers raided a suite of four Black seniors in Leverett House in response to a false 911 call.
While we are glad that there was no actual threat and no physical harm to the students, we must acknowledge that the students were hardly left emotionally unscathed.
To be woken up at 4 a.m. in the morning to the banging knocks and bellows to “open up” of police officers dressed in full riot gear, who then order you out of your suite at gunpoint, is not only unnerving but also deeply traumatic. We can only imagine how, considering the pronounced historical record of fatal outcomes between police officers and Black people, the stakes of the encounter were heightened for the four students involved.
We therefore condemn, in the strongest terms possible, the individual who made the call, as well as swatting at large. We hope Harvard will pursue justice to the fullest extent of the law — and its internal procedures, should the perpetrator be an affiliate — to deter similar appalling events.
In this attack, we see again how a militarized campus police presence can be weaponized to terrorize Black students. This incident therefore warrants, yet again, a discussion of the failure of policing on campus.
As we have opined before, HUPD is just like a city police force — but a worse one that Harvard pays for. Accordingly, it is not immune to the issues that plague militarized police units. One on-campus activist group estimated in 2020 that our University spends $20 million annually on HUPD, which by and large deals with cases of property theft and suspiciously defined “suspicious activity.” Such an institution does not end crime or poverty, but pushes us to imagine a more equitable, peaceful solution to these issues.
The weaponization of policing against Black students is only possible because policing is specifically a construct of anti-Blackness. In the history of the United States, police patrols were first created to respond to early Black resistance in the form of slave uprisings. These tactics went on to inform how policing is used broadly against communities of color today.
None of this understanding of policing’s institutional history appeared in the University’s response to the attack. The administrative response failed to acknowledge that the students were Black, a fact that significantly contextualizes the weight held by this event. The woefully underwhelming email makes only passing references to affected communities, whom it directs towards a generic list of mental health and wellbeing resources.
We are further dismayed that it took over 48 hours for administrators to string together this response to publicly acknowledge and condemn the swatting attack for the first time — longer than it took The Crimson to report on it. When it comes to what’s happening on our campus, we deserve transparency from the people who run it. As our community continues to grapple with the effects of this event, we need to understand what actions are being undertaken in the investigation, and why.
Harvard must take proactive steps to prevent swatting in general, especially given the recent increase in these violent attacks. But the University should also consider the resulting harms as they relate to historically marginalized populations on this campus — a line of inquiry that should move the University to stop perpetuating a policing system weaponized against Black students.
Until then, we extend our support and voices to the four students most affected by this deeply tragic, unfathomable event. As The Crimson’s Editorial Board, our range is often limited to words on newsprint — but we hope that, in the aftermath of this incident, those impacted can also feel the collective concern and aching hearts that penned these words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Council announced Jessica W. Chen — a second-year Ph.D. candidate studying Virology — as its new president on Thursday, temporarily setting aside a motion raised for a new, universal voting system.
The GSC, which facilitates student funding and programming, consists of divisional and program student representatives from GSAS, the largest graduate school in the University. In addition to Chen, the GSC elected Aden Solway, an Art, Film, and Visual Studies student, as its vice president.
“My vision for the presidency is to amplify the voices of students on different issues,” Chen said.
Outgoing President Zachary Lim lauded Chen for her dedication to the GSC and her reliability.
“During this past year, we’ve worked very closely together, and Jessica has been an absolute bedrock for me,” Lim said.
“I think she’s very well positioned to continue to lead the team going forward next year,” he added.
Along with the president and vice president, council members also voted for a treasurer along with six chairs for advocacy, events, recognition, research, technology, and support.
Four division representatives across the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences and four at-large division representatives for international students, master’s students, and students in the Allston and Longwood campuses were up for election as well.
Voters had the option to abstain from voting, and candidates were elected via simple majority, Chen wrote in an email.
Six positions will remain vacant — the support chair, the division representative for the humanities, a division representative for the natural sciences, and at-large representatives for international students, master’s students, and Allston students.
According to Chen, these vacancies will be open for election during the next open meeting, and if they continue to be vacant, they “would be advertised until the positions are filled,” per the GSC constitution.
At the time of voting, only one nominee stood for each position, save the vacant positions and the support chair position, whose two candidates were the two previous support chairs.
Before the election took place, however, Program Representative for Physics Sarah Y. Hoback raised a motion “to set aside the order of the day so that we can discuss the resolution for the universal vote, which gives all GSAS students the right to vote in this election.”
The proposed voting system would allow each GSAS student “to cast one vote,” Hoback said.
“Voting can be done in-person on the day of the election in April or online within a designated time frame no less than 72 hours after in-person voting takes place,” she added.
This proposal was made in part due to perceived exclusivity in the GSC election process, according to Hoback.
“There are 4,850 GSAS students and about 130 representative seats with voting power, and yet only 60 representative seats are actually filled,” Hoback said.
To discuss and clarify the language of the motion, a “two-minute recess” was called, which ultimately lasted for more than 20 minutes.
However, this motion to suspend the usual order of business in favor of discussing the changes to the electoral procedure was not passed because it failed to receive a two-thirds majority vote, with only three students voting in favor of the suspension.
Program Representative for Sociology Aaron B. Benavidez, who was nominated for vice president, advocacy chair, and social studies division representative, withdrew his candidacy from all three positions, citing what he said he believed to be a lack of student access to the election process.
“I’m looking forward to an election — elected by my peers. I would like for myself to say, I had been elected by 25 percent of the student population,” Benavidez said.
After the election, Benavidez motioned to hold at least one additional meeting later this month to “discuss the ramifications of today’s resolution,” which was passed unanimously excluding abstentions.
“I would suggest that we wait. We take as much time as we need and include as many stakeholders as possible,” said Solway, the vice president-elect. “I think we should have as many of these meetings as we can between now and the decision-making process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College and Harvard Law School activists joined Boston-area students and organizers for a rally in Copley Square Sunday in response to police violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
Israeli police forces first raided the mosque early Wednesday morning, resulting in at least 350 arrests of Palestinian worshipers and injuries to 37 Palestinians and two Israeli police officers per the Washington Post. Israeli police carried out a second raid on Wednesday night. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote the government is trying to “calm the situation,” claiming that “extremists” had barricaded themselves in the mosque.
Since Wednesday, dozens of missiles have been fired from Lebanon and the Gaza Strip into Israel. The Israel Defense Forces have subsequently launched retaliatory strikes.
More than 100 people attended the Sunday protest, organized jointly by Boston University Students for Justice in Palestine, University of Massachusetts Boston Students for Justice in Palestine, Harvard Law School Justice for Palestine, the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid, the Palestinian Youth Movement, and the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee.
“We are here today because we believe in the righteousness of our struggle and we understand that Al-Aqsa is more than just a physical space,” said second-year HLS student Tala A. Alfoqaha during the event. “Al-Aqsa is a symbol, a bearer of our national identity.”
Activist Antuan Castro Del Rio described the event as “a direct response to the violation of them going into the mosque” but also a “representation of an 80-year-long fight.”
Lea H. Kayali — one of the event’s lead organizers — described Al-Aqsa as one of the last places in Jerusalem “that is accessible by Palestinians” in an interview before the event. Kayali, a second-year student at Harvard Law School, is a member of HLS Justice for Palestine and the Palestinian Youth Movement.
“There’s been a call internationally, throughout Palestine but also throughout the world, to respond, to defend Al-Aqsa, to show our solidarity for the Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance to this onslaught,” Kayali said in an interview before the event.
Organizers said that violence against Palestinians has become increasingly common during Ramadan, the holy month of the Islamic faith.
“It’s been happening the last few years in a row during Ramadan specifically,” said Nasir Almasri, an MIT Ph.D. candidate and research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs who also helped organize the event.
Members of the Alliance for Water Justice in Palestine and the Jewish Voice for Peace Boston also attended Sunday’s protest as supporters.
“Israel has been enacting a colonist project against Palestinians, the indigenous people of that land, for several decades now,” said Eli Gerzon, a member of the Jewish Voice for Peace Boston.
“We hope that people in the United States, and especially the Jewish community, will live up to our values,” Gerzon added.
Activists called for solidarity between Palestinian liberation efforts and broader people’s liberation movements, adding that these groups are intertwined by a common cause.
“While Israel partners with American police to teach them how to better suffocate their subjects, Palestinians aligned with people globally struggling for liberation to teach each other how to breathe,” said Alfoqaha, an organizer with HLS Justice for Palestine.
Organizers said the event was primarily intended to create unity and awareness, urging protesters to join other solidarity efforts and donate to their campaigns.
“I’ll just close by asking for today not to be the last thing you do for Palestine this week,” Kayali said during the event.
“We have a responsibility to remain steadfast in solidarity with the Palestinian people and to confront Zionism,” she added.
After the event ended, speakers alike joined in a Levantine folk dance, called Dabke. Dabke is typically performed at celebrations.
“Every settler flag that’s been raised can be torn down,” Alfoqaha said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two months after Harvard launched the search for the next dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said during an interview on Thursday that the process is “well underway,” but “no announcement is imminent.”
“We are committed to taking as long as it takes to get the best possible person to fill the role,” he said.
Outgoing FAS Dean Claudine Gay and Garber are co-leading the process to select Gay’s successor, after Gay was named the 30th president of Harvard. Gay will succeed University President Lawrence S. Bacow on July 1.
Gay’s ascension to the presidency created the fourth Harvard dean vacancy. Leaders of Harvard’s School of Public Health, Divinity School, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences all announced last semester that they intend to depart from their roles at the end of the 2022-23 academic year.
The FAS dean is one of the most powerful academic leaders in the University. The role requires leading more than 1,200 faculty members and overseeing four Harvard schools: the College, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Extension School.
Garber declined to provide specific answers about the timeline of the FAS dean search, whether the search is down to a shortlist of candidates, or whether the process will conclude before Gay leaves her post in University Hall in the beginning of July.
“We don’t commit to having it completed by a certain date because our number one priority is to get the best person, and sometimes it can be done relatively quickly and sometimes it takes longer,” he said.
Garber also declined to discuss whether they are considering appointing an interim FAS dean if the search for Gay’s successor extends past July 1, but said that they “always make provisions for continuity of leadership.”
“Once you get late enough in the term before somebody steps down, we tend to make provisions to ensure that we have one or more people in mind as possible interims,” he said.
“I do not think that President Gay will still be dean of FAS Gay at the same time,” Garber added.
Garber said any dean, including the FAS dean, should possess certain qualities, such as “being able to exert intellectual leadership, being able to express a vision, being able to understand and implement the values of the community.”
During the search process, Garber said FAS-affiliated students, staff, faculty, and alumni have pointed to the importance of these characteristics in the next FAS dean.
“Pretty much what we’ve heard from the community is what you would expect,” he said.
Despite some affiliates, including Dean of Social Sciences Lawrence D. Bobo, expressing hope that the next FAS dean will come from within Harvard’s own ranks, Garber would not commit to selecting an internal candidate during Thursday’s interview.
“I have been involved in numerous dean searches in my time as provost, including the selection of all of the sitting deans,” Garber said. “I can’t recall an instance where we said we would only look internal or we would only look external.”
Garber also discussed some of the challenges that the next FAS dean will encounter over the coming years, pointing to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and the need to maintain financial stability.
“This includes funding financial aid adequately for the long term,” he said. “It also includes being able to grow the faculty and staff at an appropriate rate so that we can ensure that we remain at the forefront of the intellectual opportunities that academia has.”
Garber reaffirmed the importance of maintaining balance across STEM, social sciences, and humanities, saying that he doesn’t “see a future in which the dean of FAS will ever sacrifice one area to benefit another.”
“I believe that we need to have leadership who will ensure excellence in the sciences, the social sciences, and the arts and humanities, regardless of their professional background,” he said.

For many Harvard students, staying up until 4 a.m. typically involves a late night spent at Lamont Library to write an essay or finish a problem set.
But one dedicated group of undergraduates at Leverett House is staying up for a different reason — to cook weekly suhoor meals for Harvard affiliates throughout the month of Ramadan.
Iqra Noor ’23 said because “community is very central” to Ramadan, she and two blockmates — Reem Khalid Ali ’23 and Sadia M. Laisa ’23 — wanted to ensure students could come together for the meals.
“We start preparing food starting at 11 p.m. on Friday nights until the mealtime, which is around 4 a.m.,” Noor said. “This is honestly the only all-nighter I would pull any day.”
The ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, Ramadan is observed by Muslims worldwide as a sacred time of fasting, prayer, and reflection.
At Harvard, Muslim students, faculty, and other affiliates are coming together to break the fast at school-sponsored meals at the Student Organization Center at Hilles and student-planned events at undergraduate houses around campus.
Ramadan began this year on the evening of March 22, marking the fourth consecutive year that the month has occurred during the College’s spring classes. It will continue until sundown on April 21.
During Ramadan, observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, eating the pre-dawn meal, suhoor, early in the morning and the fast-breaking meal, iftar, in the evening.
With most dining halls closing by 7:30 p.m. and sunset occurring in Boston around 7:20 p.m. or later, eating at Harvard’s dining halls can be difficult during Ramadan.
Throughout the month, Harvard Muslim Chaplains Khalil Abdur-Rashid and Samia Omar have been hosting iftar each night from 7 to 9 p.m., followed by nightly prayer from 9 to 10 p.m. in the SOCH.
Maryam S.K. Tourk ’25, co-president of the Harvard Islamic Society, said she feels “really grateful” for the nightly gatherings at the SOCH.
“Ramadan is a very communal time, and being separated from that community can be really hard,” Tourk said. “It’s a really cool time where the SOCH kind of turns into a Muslim community hub, where there’s Muslim students from all the different Harvard schools.”
Janna E. Ramadan ’23, a Crimson Blog Editor, said she “really appreciated” the space to break fast in the SOCH among peers.
“It feels different to break your fast with other people who have also been fasting than to break your fast in the dining hall,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in a statement that “funding was provided by the President’s Office to support” iftar in the SOCH but added that he could not disclose the amount.
Tourk said she believes there is a “misconception that Ramadan is a super daunting or challenging time” for Muslims, adding that people “don’t necessarily understand the super positive and uplifting” aspects of the month.
“For me, Ramadan is actually my favorite time of the year — definitely something that is not uncommon among Muslims,” she said.
Hasan S. Quadri ’25, the other HIS co-president, said Ramadan is marked by “community interwoven with individual self-reflection.”
“I know for many students, this is the first time that they may be practicing away from home,” Quadri said. “So to be able to have an individual celebration, in addition to the community, is fantastic.”
While the SOCH offers a space for students to gather and break the fast together each night for iftar, Harvard University Dining Services’ bagged meals remain the primary option for students to get their morning meal.
Quadri said HIS began hosting weekly suhoor meals in various residential areas on campus this year to supplement Ramadan celebrations, gathering more than 50 people together for a “really good bonding experience.”
Ali — one of the Leverett House students who has been helping to cook morning meals — said she noticed a “gap” in Ramadan programming with the HUDS bagged meals provided for suhoor, which she said were “not exactly the most filling meal.”
“I think that, speaking specifically about the Lev suhoors, they’ve come to become literally my favorite thing that I’ve ever done in college,” Ali said.
Noor, Ali, and Laisa were inspired by Mather House students who began cooking suhoor last year, according to Noor.
“We were like, ‘Why not do this?’” Noor said. “It was supposed to be just like a one-time thing, and we did it once and then we had a lot of fun.”
For the month of Ramadan, HUDS established a program where groups can order breakfast ingredients to be picked up the night before.
In addition to taking advantage of HUDS’ program, Ali said their blocking group was able to secure $350 from Leverett to shop for ingredients.
In an emailed statement, Leverett House Faculty Deans Daniel G. Deschler and Eileen E. Reynolds ’86 wrote that they were “happy to support the students with the full amount that they requested.”
Deschler and Reynolds added that they “subsequently worked with them to support additional dollars for the purchase [of] house decorations for Ramadan.”
“We’re really appreciative to both HUDS and Leverett House supporting our initiative,” Noor said.
Nurayn Y. Khan ’26, an attendee of the Leverett suhoor, spoke about missing the familial element of the holiday.
“My family would always eat together, pray together, we’d go to family parties together, and all the cousins would get together,” Khan said.
While Khan said she was “a little bit sad” to be away from home during the month, she saw Ramadan at Harvard as a chance to “reinstate that sense of community and have a really fun time.”
Khan praised Noor, Ali, and Laisa’s work in preparing suhoor throughout Ramadan.
“I think Ramadan is all about being with the community and uplifting each other — and I think those three girls, they do such a good job of doing that,” Khan said. “They really, really put in the work — like they will be cooking all night, and they have so many people who come and the food is honestly amazing.”
Ramadan said there has been “extra support” for suhoor this year compared to last year, adding that there have been organized meals in houses across campus several times each week.
“There were maybe only two or three big organized ones last year, and it was more like you need to go get a bag of snacks and food from HUDS, where this year, every week we have at least one if not two or three suhoor that anyone can come out to,” Ramadan said.
“It is definitely a change that is very sweet, and people are coming out and taking advantage of it,” she added.

Remember when we told you not to go to the Barker Cafe because the drinks were too yummy and the baristas were too nice? Well, I now have another place to add to the list of cute cafes and study spots for gatekeeping. So stop reading and pay attention to your lecture because trust me, you definitely don’t want to know about yet another cozy, student-run spot to spend your Board Plus.
Well, good. Now that nobody is actually reading, what cafe am I referring to, you ask? Here’s the tl;dr.
The What and The Where: 
Cafe Gato Rojo is a good vibes-only, student-run, board plus-taking cafe nestled into the basement of Lehman Hall (the mysterious and scary graduate school building at the corner of the Yard). It finally reopened its doors this semester for the first time post-pandemic and It. Is. Glorious.
The Whys:
Why does its name translate to “red cat”? I don’t know. But I’m inclined to think it’s a reference to our beloved yard cat Remy. And I guess “red cat” was an easier translation than “tabby.”
Why is this cafe a Flyby Blog fave deserving of this whole article? A few reasons.
1. They don’t charge for non-dairy milk. That’s right. For all the lactose intolerant folks who have come to terms with dropping an extra 70 cents for almond milk in exchange for a day without stomach problems, fear no more.

The When: 
Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The How:
How are the good vibes consistently maintained in this space? As not a curator but a visitor in this liminal space, I cannot ever know for sure. But as I sit here right now, I can theorize that it’s the combination of the soft lighting, wall art from local artists, friendly baristas, audible but not distracting music volume, squishy armchairs, and most importantly, lots of OUTLETS. Charged laptops make for happy students.
So yeah. I’m definitely not studying in this cafe three out of five days a week and I hope to NOT see many of you there.
