After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard paid University President Drew G. Faust $875,331 in salary and benefits in 2010, slightly more than the $874,559 she earned in 2009, according to a report in the Boston Globe.
In 2010, Faust received $120,901 out of her benefits package in the form of the use of her Cambridge mansion, known as Elmwood.
Faust is far from the highest-paid university president. According to a report in the Chronicle of Higher Education, E. Gordon Gee, president of Ohio State University, boasted the biggest paycheck among public university presidents in the 2010-11 fiscal year, at $1,992,221 in salary and benefits. In 2009, the Chronicle reported, Yale President Richard C. Levin made more than $1.6 million, making him the ninth-highest-paid private university president. The number one earner that year, Drexel’s Constantine N. Papadakis, took home more than $4.9 million.
Pay for several officials at the Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard’s more than $30 billion endowment, greatly exceeded Faust’s compensation, according to the Globe report.
Jane L. Mendillo, president and CEO of HMC, earned $3.5 million, down from $4.8 million in 2009.
HMC Managing Director and Head of External Management Andrew G. Wiltshire received $5.5 million, making him the highest-paid official at HMC in 2010.
HMC determines compensation for many of its managers based on investment performance, according to a 2011 press release.
Harvard’s endowment grew to $32 billion for the fiscal year 2011, up from $27.4 billion at the close of fiscal year 2010.
Mendillo and other endowment managers “continue to steer the endowment through challenging markets, returning value to the portfolio and the university while positioning Harvard’s endowment for the long term,” University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg '68 said in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the NBA season comes to a close, the rumors surrounding this summer’s free agents are just beginning to heat up. It’s no different for Jeremy Lin ’10.
When the New York Knicks signed Lin in December of 2011, the expiration date of the contract was the end of the 2011-12 season. And since his team was eliminated after a first-round loss to the Miami Heat, reports about Lin’s future in New York have been numerous and wide-ranging.
While much of the media has written about the possibility of two-time MVP Steve Nash heading to the Big Apple, Knicks General Manager Glen Grunwald shot down that possibility on Friday afternoon.
Grunwald told reporters in a conference call that he “can’t see a scenario where we don’t keep [Jeremy] Lin.” If that proved true, Nash would not be joining the Knicks,  thanks to limits imposed by the salary cap.
But in classic GM style, Grunwald made sure to make th­­at statement not entirely definitive.
In other Lin-related news, the Harvard alum is now one step closer to finally owning the term "Linsanity.” According to the Huffington Post, Pamela Deese, Lin’s personal lawyer, stated on Thursday that all applications to own the word other than Lin's were denied by The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, implying that ownership of the term will soon be granted to the former Harvard standout.
For now, all Lin fans can do is hope that by Lin’s owning the term, the magic of Linsanity will be brought back to the point guard and Madison Square Garden once more.
