After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a time and a place to celebrate diversity, open-mindedness, and love for all humankind. That time and place is not, however, in the face of a misguided and hateful group with nonexistent public support. The Westboro Baptist Church’s announcement that it will come to Harvard (again) on Friday, this time to protest outside Harvard Hillel to “remind these Jews that they bear the curse of their forefather’s murder of Christ,” raised the hackles of many, none the least those associated with Hillel. While the planned counter-protest to celebrate diversity is a reasonable and hopefully cheery response to the WBC’s blatant disrespect and negativity, the best way for Harvard to deal with the Westboro protest would be to simply ignore it. Holding a celebration of diversity near Hillel at the same time as the Westboro protest simply draws more attention to the protesters and adds legitimacy to their message, giving them exactly what they want.
Harvard prides itself on its commitment to diversity and its respect for people of all stripes. Our values are not in question; there have been no recent happenings of note that deem it necessary to publicly reaffirm our commitment to said values. Thus, there is no need for an event of this type.  Engaging the protestors will make them seem like they are a credible threat to our community. Harvard’s values and Harvard students are much stronger than a small flock of unpleasant people with a deranged message.
Furthermore, the Westboro Baptist Church is a fringe group—a fundamentalist splinter faction with which an average Baptist would not wish to be associated. The constituency of the church is very small; Its members are mostly from the same family and are largely descendents of the founder, Reverend Fred W. Phelps. Combined with its nonsensical mission, the group’s small size and marginal nature eliminates any reason to debate them.
The Westboro members have a history of coming to Harvard, likely because the Harvard name automatically garners media attention. They staged a similar event last year outside Harvard Law School to protest the “anti-Christ Barack Obama,” and another one outside Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in March 2009. Continuing to acknowledge their presence will only encourage them to return, as they will likely expect to get attention from being here. The less we take notice, the less anyone else will.
In general, we believe it beneficial for members of different religions to meet and have discussions, but we would like to see multi-faith events that aren’t pegged to the Westboro protest. This is the wrong impetus for such an otherwise positive occasion.
For those angered by the Westboro protest, Friday is supposed to be a beautiful day. Take a walk along the Charles. Spend quality time with a loved one. Read the Bible, even. Celebrate love in your own, private manner. That is the best way to protest any message of hate.

The party is over for Loko. At least, it’s the end of the drink as we know it, and the decision doesn’t bother me. The malt-liquor based concoction contains up to 12 percent alcohol and comes in eight fruity flavors. One 23.5-ounce can of Four Loko contains roughly the equivalent of six standard servings of alcohol and five cups of coffee. A University Health Services administrator called Four Loko “badness in a can,” and that describes it perfectly. While some argue that colleges have no right to ban alcoholic, caffeinated energy drinks from campuses, I believe that this is exactly what they should be doing. With the health risks involved, it is no wonder that whole states are forbidding the sale of the dangerous drink.
Four Loko’s combination of caffeine and alcohol can be deceptively dangerous. This constitution means the drink contains both a depressant and a stimulant; the high one receives from caffeine can veil how much alcohol is inside. Students don’t realize how much they really have had to drink, because the caffeine masks many of the signs they are used to feeling. Therefore, students may keep drinking more of this beverage, not feelings its effects or realizing they are intoxicated.
Many college students around the country have required medical treatment in connection with consuming Four Loko. There have even been connections between a recent teenage death and the drink. At other schools, hospitalizations have led to the banning of the beverage by university officials. As cited in The Crimson, Ramapo College of New Jersey outlawed Four Loko after 23 students were hospitalized for alcohol-related reasons. Additionally, Central Washington University banned alcoholic energy drinks after nine freshmen were hospitalized from drinking Four Loko at a party.
It is clear this drink is aimed at college-age students. Chris Hunter, Jason Freeman, and Jeff Wright, the three Ohio State students who developed Four Loko, told The Columbus Dispatch that they got the idea for the drink after noticing that students were mixing alcohol and caffeine in bars.  They then began the manufacturer Phusion LLC and began selling 23-ounce cans of Four Loko at stores around the college. In fact, many adults did not hear about this beverage until bans started to be issued. At around $3 a can, it is the cheapest way for students to start their parties off in the manner they want. As a USC student told The Daily Trojan, “It’s definitely a popular drink among my friends, partly because it’s so low-priced for the amount of alcohol it contains.”
It causes not only heath concerns but social ones as well. One Facebook page dedicated to the drink posts the warning, “You will remember absolutely nothing in the morning, (you) probably acted like a slut, and possibly tried to fight someone. It's a Four Loko thing...” It seems utterly nonsensical that students continue to drink the beverage despite the consequences. Some Harvard students sent out emails over personal and open lists asking if anyone wanted to stock up on Four Loko before the Massachusetts ban was enforced. Despite this effort, it has actually become hard to find the beverage anywhere recently. However, it is easy to spot who has had their hands on the drink at the recent parties I have attended. Generally, these are the people that brag about having the beverage and then make a fool of themselves: dancing on tables, making out with random people, taking off their clothes, and more. Its unofficial slogan, said Charles Schelle at The Ball State Daily News, is “horny, hyper, and happy.”
The misuse of Four Loko shows once again that American teenagers are not responsible enough to consume alcoholic beverages safely. Even here at Harvard, students are refusing to see the dangers of consuming Four Loko and its repercussions. The alcoholic beverage with a caffeine kick briefly captured the hearts—and livers—of America's youth, and it needed to be stopped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night marked the first night of Hanukkah, and menorahs are ubiquitous here in Jerusalem. Plastic candelabras hang from the streetlights of the road near my dorms on Mount Scopus, overlooking the ruins of the Jewish temple liberated by the Maccabees in the second century BCE. With four holiday parties and a weekend trip to Safed on the horizon, I thought, now is the time to bathe myself in candlelight and kick back with some dreidel, jelly donuts, and upbeat Hanukkah-themed acapella music.
But then I received an email from Cambridge. And I am reminded that there is still darkness in this world.
Tomorrow, Fred Phelps’s Westboro Baptist Church, a group known for their bizarre abhorrence of all things beautiful, is planning a demonstration outside of Harvard Hillel. This won’t be its first visit to Cambridge. Last year, the church—if it even deserves this title—brought its unique blend of hatred to the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and Harvard Law School. Its members protested the former for facilitating a gay-straight alliance among its students and the latter for helping spawn our current president, whom they consider the anti-Christ. On Friday, the WBC will continue to exercise its First Amendment rights by reminding Harvard’s Jewish population that they are sinners in God’s eyes. 
In response, a group of Harvard undergraduates is planning a Surprise Absurdity Protest. Intended to be a “whimsical event,” the rally—which already boasts over 450 attendees on Facebook—will feature music, food, and hilariously meaningless faux-protest signs. This solution has been met with opposition from some who believe that the best way to deal with these crazy congregants is to ignore them entirely. But a WBC visit is a terrible thing to waste. If done correctly, Harvard’s counter-protest has the potential to galvanize the community in such an extraordinary fashion that it would far outweigh the damage wrought by paying the church heed.
Those who oppose WBC counter-rallies often do so out of concern that showering the church with attention gives the church exactly what it desires. It is surely undeniable that WBC members crave the spotlight. As it explains on its website, Westboro views the United   States as a den of lust, filth, and corruption. Fashioning themselves as modern-day prophets, members of the WBC believe that exhorting Americans to repent before their wrathful and spiteful God is “this world's last hope” for salvation. Thus, as Brian J. Bolduc ’10 put it in his Crimson column last year, “the WBC [feeds] off the publicity like a cancer.”
Crucially, however, this does not mean that all WBC counter-protests grant the WBC a victory.
When these Bible thumpers come to picket, they expect to be greeted by mobs filled with scorn for their teachings, much like those that greeted the prophet Jeremiah. So when mobs like these do appear and begin screaming and hurling epithets, WBC members are emboldened, not fazed. Furthermore, the WBC literally banks on its counter-protesters turning violent. Fred Phelps has over three decades of legal experience, and 11 of his 13 children hold law degrees. Those whose emotions get the best of them at these rallies often end up paying the WBC’s travel expenses. The church, in short, both lives for and lives off of provoking its detractors.
But what if a WBC counter-protest doesn’t actually engage the WBC? What if activists ignored them entirely and instead utilized the church’s appearance as a method of strengthening communal ties and raising money for charity?
The benefits of such a positive response would offset the minimal attention the church would receive as a result. At Stanford earlier this year, for example, over 800 students responded to a WBC delegation by participating in a fun and spirited gathering designed to boost school spirit and emphasize their shared values. The Stanford Daily later opined that “the outcome of the protest was one of the most positive expressions of commonality we’ve seen on campus since we upset USC.” Similarly, rather than ignore the Westboro congregants, one Manhattan synagogue last year told people to pledge a dollar or more for every minute of their protest. After 50 minutes, the synagogue raised a total of $10,000.
True, rallies and fundraisers like these should occur regardless of the presence of a hate group. But people need a focal point around which they can direct their energies. In both of these cases, a community was able to funnel WBC’s negativity into something extremely positive, and tomorrow’s Absurdity Protest has the same guiding philosophy. So even though the Westboro members may gain some media attention on Friday, as long as we’re able to glean more light than darkness from their appearance, it behooves us to take full advantage of their unintended Hanukkah present.
So come out tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.. Don’t even look at the Westboro clan. Grab a hilariously absurd sign and a bite to eat. You’re not going to convince the WBC of anything, but you will help raise money for some great causes, make new friends, demonstrate the solidarity of our student body, and have some terrific fun in the process.
It is, after all, the season to be jolly.

Every year right around this time, everyone from talking heads to borderline fans start to make noise about the need for a college football playoff. Currently, the larger, more competitive Division I teams are a part of the Bowl Champion Series. At the end of the regular season for the conferences involved, the BCS determines which teams will take part in a variety of “bowl” games, final match-ups such as the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The centerpiece of these bowls is the National Championship Game, and the teams that are selected to play in these games do so based on a combination of polls and quantitative measurements of each team such as points per game, difficulty of schedule.
While this system does not at first seem unreasonable, it has come under fire during instances in which more than two teams have held the same record at the end of the regular season (often being undefeated). Problems also arise when a team is ranked higher than another team that has a better record because of the other factors that go into the ranking process. This scenario occurred in 2008, when Oklahoma University and the University of Florida were chosen to play for the National Championship even though the University of Utah held a perfect record of 13-0 and Oklahoma had already lost a game. This has not been the only time that seemingly worthy teams have been left out of title contention, and it is a product of the subjective nature of the selection process. How do we decide whether just barely beating a team on the road is better than blowing a team out at home? What happens to our assessment of a team if one loss comes at the end of a highly ranked opponent or a school from out of nowhere?
The answer to these questions for many is to institute a playoff system. Rather than arguing for hours about the subjective measurements of the ins and outs of college football, creating a bracket of the four, eight, or 16 best teams would let the teams play out what was otherwise decided by people sitting around a room. A college football playoff superficially represents a solution to the current bowl situation, but it would only further devalue the education of the student football players as well as go against the guiding principles of collegiate athletics.
Division I varsity athletes put a tremendous amount of time into their sports. Between practices, workouts, traveling, and the actual games, many of them do not have adequate time to attend to their schoolwork. Some of the best football teams in the country tout graduation rates below 50 percent for its players, leaving too many students with highlight reels and without diplomas. To remain competitive at the highest level, many of these programs also have no offseasons, continuing to practice and work out during the rest of the school year and summer. Adding an entire three or four more games (each that must be spread a week apart) will only increase the imbalance between sport and school. March Madness, the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s annual college basketball tournament, is one of the most exciting sporting events in the country, but teams that make it until the final rounds spend almost an entire month playing all over the country, providing a fairly large obstacle to school work.
The greater issue with the drive for a college football playoff is the misled desire to determine yearly supremacy. The goal of intercollegiate athletics has never been to decide the national champion in the most accurate way. Rather, as the NCAA states in its core purpose statement, it is “to integrate intercollegiate athletics into higher education so that the educational experience of the student-athlete is paramount.” The NCAA may not have an adequate system for determining which team is the national champion, but that has never been its goal.
The Harvard football team beat Yale for the fourth year in a row before Thanksgiving, ending their season in dramatic fashion. Both teams played at a very high level and it was a genuinely fun affair. This is what college football should be about, instilling camaraderie and school spirit, displaying the talent and hard work put in by the players. There is nothing wrong with it being unclear at the end of the season which team in the country is really the best; healthy, balanced competition and school spirit should remain the winning combination.

Former Ambassador from Pakistan to the United Kingdom Akbar Ahmed discussed the growing gap between American culture and the Islamic world at an event organized by the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program last night in Tsai Auditorium.
Ahmed, who serves as an Islamic studies professor at American University, recently published “Journey into America: The Challenge of Islam,” which examines modern American perspectives on the religion.
In his introduction of Ambassador Ahmed, Associate Director of the Harvard Islamic Studies Program Ali S. Asani ’77 said that the author is “combating this clash of ignorance by educating people.”
In his lecture, Ahmed said that after the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, he knew that “the gap which would open between Muslims and non-Muslims would not be easily closed.”
When Ahmed was asked what issues he thought faced young Muslims in modern society, he cited the “Four D’s: Drinking, Drugs, Dating, and Dancing” as issues that highlight the disconnect between traditional Muslim beliefs and American cultural norms.
Nonetheless, Ahmed said that “America is still the best place in the world to be a Muslim.” The nation’s religious freedom, he said, provides Muslims with the opportunity to succeed.
Commenting on his recent trip across the U.S. interviewing Muslims and non-Muslims alike, Ahmed said that it was not surprising to find that some Americans had never interacted with a Muslim before meeting him.
He also called on several of his research assistants to relay their own experiences interviewing Americans about the Islamic world. The assistants spoke of participants who mistakenly believed that non-Muslims are forbidden from entering mosques, and one who inquired if “Pakistanis loved their children.”
Ahmed said that he was disheartened in the course of his research to realize that many Americans were unaware of the close ties between the sacred texts of Christianity and Islam.
“What saddened me the most in this noise of ignorance was the overlooking of the deep bonds that exist between us,” he said.
Briahna J. Gray ’07, a Harvard Law School student in attendance, said she was impressed by Ahmed’s talk.
“He clearly did a lot of a extensive field work and I’d love to hear all of the stories that he has,” she said.
In an interview at the end of the lecture, Ahmed said that he is continuing his research and his next book will seek to answer 20 of the most pressing issues that Americans have regarding Islam.

In a talk last night at the Graduate School of Design, actor and philanthropist Edward H. Norton emphasized that young people have the tools to change the world.
The lecture, “Social Entrepreneurship and the Built Environment—James Rouse and His Legacy,” discussed advocacy for sustainable urban development by the late James Rouse, Norton’s grandfather.
During the talk, Norton discussed Rouse’s legacy as an urban planner with Jonathan F. P. Rose, who founded an urban development firm. Rouse designed Norton’s hometown of Columbia, Md. and Faneuil Hall in Boston.
“He was very ahead of his time in social ethics,” Norton said of his grandfather.
Rose added that Rouse’s greatest strength was that “he had a holistic view of developing...he could see the whole.”
This “holistic view” was presented as the need to consider all aspects of the urban society, including education, infrastructure and the environment when developing a city.
“A city isn’t just a dense bunch of buildings,” Rose said. “[They] will not work unless people have a connection with nature.”
In spite of the economic downturn, Norton thinks his grandfather would still be optimistic about the future of urban sustainability. “I think he believed recessions are drivers of change,” he said. “He would say ‘go at the hardest things because no problem is insoluble.”
Although the overall message was hopeful, Rose and Norton noted the U.S. cannot always take its position in the world for granted.
In terms of infrastructure, “the U.S. is left behind,” Rose said, citing China’s rapid development as an example.
“I think more young people need to start embracing that we’re not number one,” Norton said.
Attendees said they felt inspired by the messages of Norton, Rose, and, by extension, Rouse.
“Usually at these lectures you get people with great end results but don’t know how to get there,” Allen J. MacLeod ’14 said. “However, they were able to cite examples of what has worked and it was very well conceived.”
Norton himself said he still feels the influence of Rouse.
“He remains a very active presence and inspiration,” Norton said.

Speaking at the Harvard Graduate School of Education yesterday, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice argued that many nations in the developing world are rapidly becoming multi-ethnic democracies, creating a need for these nations to address the issue of racial inequality and the question of what it means to be a citizen.
The lecture served as the second segment of Rice’s three-part lecture series at Harvard, entitled “American Foreign Policy and the Black Experience.”
Rice, who served as the Bush Administration’s chief diplomat from 2005 to 2009, noted that the issue of race and its socioeconomic ramifications has increasingly become a priority for democratically-elected governments in Latin America and Africa.
“I personally went to Brazil in 1993 and when you talked to Brazilians they said that they didn’t ‘have a race problem,’” Rice said. “But you noticed that all the field hands were African, the hotel staff was mulatto and the government was Portuguese. This made you think, ‘maybe [Brazil does] have a race problem.’”
But Rice also illustrated how Brazil has recently begun to address its problems with racial inequality, noting that outgoing Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was the first president to publicly acknowledge this issue.
Rice asserted that, in addressing this issue of racial inequality, multi-ethnic democracies throughout the world are modeling their policies on initiatives implemented by the United States, such as affirmative action in college admissions and corporate hiring.
“It has become apparent to me that while the American multi-ethnic experiment was originally unique to the United States, it is now spreading in very important ways,” Rice said.
Following the event, several students in the audience said they were impressed with Rice’s speech.
“I know of her political background but I never thought of her as an academic,” said post-doctoral student Jennifer Silva. “It was really interesting to hear her speak.”
But Silva also felt that the lecture was not as expansive as it could have been.
“We hear more and more that we live in a winner-take-all society and that has implications for race,” Silva said. “So I would have liked to hear more about the economic aspects of political power.”
Rice’s third and final lecture in the series, titled “Why Democracy Matters: Education, Empowerment and the American National Myth at Home and Abroad,” will be held tomorrow in the Longfellow Building at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

The Immediate Gratification Players, one of two Harvard improvisational comedy groups, will be releasing its first published book, “So You Think You’re Funny: A Students’ Guide to Improv Comedy,” later this week.
The book, a how-to guide on improvisational comedy aimed at students, was written and edited collectively by all the members of last year’s IGP group.
“The book’s 12 chapters take you from doing your first improv scene to performing a show on the stage,” said IGP’s “czar” Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11.
“There are very few books about improv aimed at a true beginner, and even fewer from the perspective of a student,” he said. “This book will truly turn someone from an improv nobody to an improv hero.”
Levin-Gesundheit added that the book’s planning process began nearly a year ago, with the writing occurring last spring and the editing over the summer.
“The idea of writing as an improv troupe sort of came naturally to us,” Levin-Gesundheit said. “Improv performance is thinking as a group and merging minds, and writing together was simply an extension of that.”
The group, founded in 1986, used its nearly 25 years of improv experience to craft a book that will appeal to both improvisation enthusiasts and other students, according to Levin-Gesundheit.
“Other people will want to read the book because improvisation uses a different part of the mind, and makes you think on your feet,” Levin-Gesundheit said. He then added sarcastically, “this book does even more than that—it provides a basic moral framework for day-to-day life.”
“They were very professional despite a lack of publishing experience,” said Theodore Zapel, executive editor at Meriwether Publishing and publisher of the book, in an e-mail. “When I received the IGP book proposal originally titled ‘Funny Kids’ late last year, I thought this book was unique in that it is written from the student’s perspective.”
He added that his company  would  be willing to work with IGP on another book in the future. “Now that they know how the publishing process works, the next book should go more smoothly and swiftly,” he said.
Sarah C. Haskins ’01, a former member of IGP who has read the book, wrote in an e-mail that the book has a “‘DIY’ focus that is valuable for people who want to do improv but don’t have a ready made improv community at hand.”
In reference to the group’s efforts, she added, “as an IGP alum, I am very proud they chose to do something so productive and lasting, whereas normally our accomplishments are silly and ephemeral. I hope they make billions of dollars.”

Last night’s World AIDS Day Rally took both a commemorative and a political tone as more than 100 people gathered in the Boston Common gazebo to honor the millions of lives that have been lost to the disease and to advocate for further funding and support for health care across the globe.
“It took a combined effort to make this work tonight,” said Rumbidzai C. Mushavi ’12 of the Harvard African Student Association. “Obviously the weatherman didn’t cooperate, but the idea is that HIV/AIDS continues regardless of the weather, and so will we.”
Mushavi added that members of many student organizations—including HASA, the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition (HAC), the Black Students Association, the Chinese Students Association, Harvard Queer Students and Allies, and several campus religious groups—as well as students from local universities, had gathered to remember those who have died and to take a stand for further action.
“Let us not forget how far we’ve come and let us not forget how far we need to go,” Mushavi said. “We can eliminate HIV/AIDS in the next generation but we need to act now.”
Patrick T. Lee, who directs the Global Primary Care Program at the Massachusetts General Hospital and serves as medical director for the social justice and health organization Tiyatien Health, also encouraged attendees to take action, emphasizing putting global solidarity into practice by delivering health care across the globe.
“Health workers must be trained, equipped, and paid so they can accompany patients on their road to recovery,” Lee said. “All of you, especially students and young professionals, see the difference between the world as it is and the world as it could be and should be—you are in a position to speak truth to power.”
Members of HAC have been striving to reach out to political powers by communicating with political leaders, hoping to elicit a public move in favor of HIV/AIDS funding. Of communications with Senator John Kerry, HAC member Lulu R. Tsao ’12 said that HAC members have been “dogging him to keep his promise to fight for funding,” but have not received a response.
“We’re not here just to commemorate the victims of the epidemic, but also to call on Senators Kerry and Brown to be public advocates for global AIDS funding,” Tsao said.
At the end of the rally, attendees marched to Kerry and Brown’s offices, chanting and armed with personalized note cards asking the senators to hold Obama accountable to his promises to fund the fight against AIDS at home and around the world.
Marguerite Thorp ’11, another member of HAC involved in the political side of the group’s work, said that their meetings with Kerry’s staff had been “full of rhetoric, but no action yet.” She added that today’s rally occurs at a key moment, as Obama is soon to finalize the budget for the next fiscal year. HAC and other global health and AIDS advocates hope for an increase of at least $1.8 billion for global health and AIDS funding.
The rally featured several speakers, a spoken word piece, and a performance of “Waterfalls” and “There’s Hope” by KeyChange, a Harvard a capella group featuring music of the African diaspora and committed to serving the community.
KeyChange music director Keith B. Doelling ’11 said that music can bring people together and inspire them to action.
“Sometimes we need to focus on the future and work toward not just making words or music, but making change,” Doelling said. “Even with all our daily troubles—whether our busy schedules or addressing issues in global health—we still can have hope for the next day.”

Harvard’s Library Implementation Work Group announced yesterday a major change to the administrative organization of the Harvard University Library, following through on recommendations presented by a task force last fall.
The new administrative structure will have an oversight board chaired by the University provost and comprised of between 9 and 11 professors and deans. The board—whose members will be decided in the next few weeks—will appoint an executive director for the library system.
Current library director Robert C. Darnton ’60, who is also a University Professor, will no longer serve as director after this academic year, allowing another administrator to step into the new structure. Darnton will continue to advise the director, who will also work closely with Librarian of Harvard College Nancy M. Cline.
The Task Force on University Libraries advised the University to make such changes in a report released in Nov. 2009, but until now improvements to the nation’s largest academic library have been slow to materialize.
“The goal of this [administrative restructuring] is to really position Harvard to be more at the cutting edge with regard to developing IT infrastructure, resources—digital being the key fabric for not only research but also the medium for academic content,” said Divinity School Professor David C. Lamberth, chair of the Harvard Library Implementation Work Group.
While the current governing structure remained decentralized, with schools autonomously managing their schools autonomously managing their respective libraries, the new structure is intended to build coordination through a more centralized administration, making disparate libraries more “harmonized,” Lamberth said.
Lamberth said that through this consolidation, however, the library will continue efforts to enlist professors from different schools, ensuring that the Harvard University Library maintains its robust collections in very specialized fields.
In perhaps the most tangible improvement that students might perceive, Lamberth said that he hopes, in particular, to see great improvements in connecting IT resources with the materials on bookshelves.
“What we hope is that students are going to see changes mostly through better access and broader access to materials,” Lamberth said.
“One of the challenges now is finding out exactly what Harvard has. We hope soon to be able to find out quickly and comprehensively what Harvard has to offer.”
Several professors said they trusted the working group’s conclusion, agreeing that the library system was in need of minor improvements, which they believed the new executive body could make.
“These are very knowledgeable leaders making very knowledgeable decisions,” said History Professor Steven E. Ozment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Focusing on the delivery of health care will not only help reform the current, flawed medical system, but will also become the newest frontier in science, Dartmouth College President Jim Yong Kim said in a lecture at Harvard yesterday.
At the talk, entitled “Why We Can’t Wait: Building A Science of Global Health Care Delivery,” Kim discussed his experiences working with diseases that affect impoverished nations.
Kim, who co-founded the international non-governmental organization Partners in Health, discussed how his own experiences in the global health field helped to shape his endeavors today, which include promoting public health programs at Dartmouth.
As that university’s leader, Kim has been involved in the development of the Masters in Health Care Delivery Science program, a joint venture between the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the Tuck School of Business. The program is designed to address the issue of delivering low-cost health care to all types of people.
To reform the current health care system and help more lower-income people, Kim said more scientists will need to study this field.
“It can’t just be one campus,” Kim said. “It has to be every medical school in every country tackling this problem.”
When working with victims of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Africa, Kim said he found a link between morals and epidemiological rationale.
The wealthy often do not take responsibility for the welfare of poor people, Kim said, and they give up when confronted with the difficulties of health care distribution.
Instead, this group should seek new alternatives, he said.
“Every time you think it’s too costly or too expensive, think again,” Kim said. “If you’re serious, take on a fight at every level.”
Speaking on World AIDS Day, Kim also gave a brief history of the expansion of the disease into a pandemic, from its introduction in America during the 1980s, to the protests that erupted years later in opposition to the rapid spread of AIDS.
Kim’s own experiences working with AIDS date back to 2003, when he worked with a former director general of the World Health Organization to create the “3x5” campaign, in which the WHO promised to put three million people in developing countries on AIDS treatment by 2005.
“We couldn’t believe people were saying to the 25 million people in Africa with AIDS: ‘I’m sorry... but you’re dead,’” Kim said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of professors and former CIA agents used the new film “Countdown to Zero” as a jumping off point to discuss the need for total elimination of nuclear weapons at a Kennedy School Forum at the Institute of Politics last night.
Matthew Bunn, associate professor of public policy, Valerie Plame Wilson and Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, former CIA agents, and Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, also discussed citizen engagement with this issue and the necessity of preparation for an imminent attack.
Although they all agreed a nuclear offensive was a real threat and that the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was an important step towards reducing this possibility, the panelists proposed different ways of dealing with and addressing nuclear weapons.
Bunn acknowledged the commonly held misconception about the skill level required to produce a nuclear bomb.
“Many people think it takes a Manhattan Project to make a bomb,” Bunn said, adding that it would be plausible for a terrorist group with the requisite materials to make a crude bomb.
Mowatt-Larssen added that nuclear weapons are appealing to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda because they have significant “implications on our way of life and our values.”
Despite this sobering message, Bunn said, “It is an amazing fact that we’ve had no nuclear weapons used since 1945,” adding that the number of states with nuclear capabilities has stayed constant at nine.
There is little room for error in addressing nuclear issues, according to Mowatt-Larssen, but it is equally important to confront the challenge.
“Fear is not productive,” he said.
“We have to learn to live with the prospect, accept the possibility, so if and when it does happen, we can deal with it more maturely,” he added.
Bunn, along with the other panelists, referred to the new START treaty—the bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty that is currently being debated in the Senate—throughout the evening as a critical step towards combatting possibly destructive nuclear activity.
He also highlighted the importance of individuals in catalyzing change, recommending that people call their senators and donate to causes involved in nuclear non-proliferation.
“Citizens who sit down and think about a problem and make some noise can make a difference,” Bunn said.
On the other end of the spectrum, Wilson cited total elimination of nuclear weapons as the solution. “We cannot do this unilaterally,” she said, “It’s going to take a really long time but we have to start somewhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has introduced a new retirement program for faculty members that will make permanent a revised version of last year’s one-time retirement offer that allows professors to gradually lessen their teaching duties, according to an e-mail FAS Dean Michael D. Smith sent to faculty members yesterday.
The new retirement program, which became available yesterday and will last for “the foreseeable future[,]” according to the program brochure, provides two options to professors aged 65 to 72 and—in a deviation from last year’s program—only one option to those who are over 72. Professors must have served at Harvard for at least 10 years to be eligible.
The plan builds off of a temporary program offered last December that the administration established as it sought flexibility in long-term planning in the wake of the fiscal crisis.
The details of the new program closely reflect those of last year’s. Professors between the ages of 65 and 72 can reduce their teaching and service obligations by half for either two or four academic years before fully retiring. In the two-year option, professors can choose to have two semesters of paid sabbatical if they teach full time for the other two semesters, and receive full salary for the entire two years. In the four-year option, they receive full salary in the first year and half during the next three years.
But, unlike with last year’s plan, professors over 72 can now only choose to halve their obligations for two years, during which they receive half salary.
In addition to allowing faculty members to plan their retirement, the program also enables more accurate academic scheduling by FAS. But according to FAS spokesman Jeff A. Neal, the new launch does not have a target number of professors that FAS expects will accept the retirement offer.
“By knowing who plans to retire and when, we can plan for their departure in advance,” Neal wrote.
According to Neal, the program is also part of a larger process to “bolster our long term goal of supporting an increasingly diverse faculty.”
In last year’s retirement program, 40 of the 46 participants across the University—similar one-year programs were offered at four other schools—were white men, 4 were white women, and only 2 were minorities, according to the 2010 Annual Report from Harvard’s Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity.
One reason why the FAS administration decided to make the program permanent is the positive response from eligible professors who opted into last year’s program, according to the program’s brochure.
“We have learned that a significant number of eligible faculty did, indeed, find the plan useful in planning for their retirements,” Neal wrote in an e-mail.
History Professor Steven E. Ozment said that he was “not surprised” that FAS made the retirement offer permanent.
“You’ve offered a certain number of buyouts. Now you have to make the program fluid.” Ozment said.
“I think the administration is being really responsible... they might sweeten the pot to encourage people to retire,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
These days, it seems like we’re all stuck in transition. With the end of Thanksgiving feasting, Christmas decorations are popping up everywhere and the Holiday Spirit is taking over. Classes may be ending tomorrow, but reading period and finals are just around the corner. Similarly, fall sports are winding down, but that just means winter sports are picking up. Let’s huddle around the water cooler and see what's happening around the Ivy League this week.
The Penn women’s volleyball team earned the League’s NCAA bid last week, defeating Yale, 3-2, in a win that had Quakers fans yelling the familiar chant: “Just like football!” Now, Penn (17-10) will head down to Durham, N.C., to play against Ohio (22-12) in its second-straight NCAA appearance on Friday. The Quakers won their first NCAA match last year in a 3-1 victory over Army and hope to repeat their success this weekend.
Yesterday, the four finalists were announced for the 2010 Asa S. Bushnell Cup, given annually to the Ancient Eight’s most outstanding football player. Harvard senior running back Gino Gordon is in contention alongside Princeton senior wide receiver Trey Peacock, Dartmouth junior tailback Nick Schwieger, and Penn sophomore quarterback Billy Ragone for the title.
The race looks like it will come down to a faceoff between Gordon and Schwieger. By numbers alone, both athletes lead the pack and are neck-and-neck in almost every category.  Schwieger leads the Ancient Eight in rushing for the second consecutive year and tied the school record of 14 touchdowns in a single season. He reached 1,133 yards this season, barely edging out Gordon’s 1,059 yards. On the other hand, Gordon outscored Schwieger this season, with 25 total touchdowns to his name.
But don’t rule out Peacock and Ragone so soon. As with any subjective competition in athletics, there’s always a possibility for an upset. The winner will be announced Monday at 11:30 a.m. Stay tuned.
The weather may be cooling down, but that just means men’s basketball and other winter sports are only beginning to heat up. American East rivals Hartford and Vermont are scheduled to play a total of five games against the Ivy League this week. The Hawks lost 81-76 at Yale last night while the Catamounts host Dartmouth later tonight. Hartford, which will visit Brown tomorrow night, is led by forward Morgan Sabia and guard Joe Zeglinski. Together, the senior standouts consistently average a combined total of over 32 points per game. Meanwhile, Vermont can thank senior forward Evan Fjeld for its strong 4-1 start, which includes two dominant wins over Siena and NJIT. Averaging 21.6 points per game, Fjeld will pose a strong threat to Dartmouth tonight and to Yale this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
December has arrived, and the ECAC women’s hockey season is in full swing. The conference has a clear frontrunner—the top team in the nation, no less—but besides Cornell, the league’s having a rough opening to the season. The Back Page takes a look at who’s trending up and who’s crashing down in the first edition of ECAC power rankings.
1. Cornell (11-1-0, 6-0-0 ECAC, 1st in conference)
This one’s a no-brainer. After blanking Niagara by a combined 12-0 score in last weekend’s two-game set, the Big Red rose to No. 1 in the national polls, and Cornell kept its seven-game win streak going with a 4-1 win over Syracuse last night. The Big Red is far and away the best team in the ECAC, and it should have no problem handling Clarkson and St. Lawrence at home this weekend.
2. Quinnipiac (11-6-1, 4-5-0, 4th)
Though they got off to a rocky start in the ECAC, dropping games to weaker Colgate and Rensselaer early on, the Bobcats are back on the upswing after winning the Nutmeg Classic last weekend. Rookie Kelly Babstock leads the nation in points (33) and game-winning goals (five), and junior Kate Wheeler was named the ECAC player of the week for her five-point weekend.
3. Harvard (4-4-2, 4-2-2, t-2nd)
Harvard has flitted in and out of the bottom of the polls all season, currently out after being swept by No. 7 Minnesota in Minneapolis last weekend. The Crimson hasn’t found a consistent presence in the net, and its penalty kill is the worst in the country. But the offense got going on Sunday against a strong Gopher squad, and if it plays well, Harvard’s got a chance to take down No. 6 Boston College this weekend.
4. St. Lawrence (7-6-2, 3-2-0, t-7th)
St. Lawrence has been on a roll lately, winning its last three games and dropping just one contest in the month of November—a 4-1 loss at the hands of archrival Clarkson. The Saints may be better than their record indicates, as they beat and tied Boston  College Nov. 12 and 13 and played No. 5 BU close back in October. Friday’s tangle with Cornell should give a better indication of just how good St. Lawrence is.
5. Dartmouth (6-4-0, 5-3-0, t-2nd)
After vaulting into the national rankings two weeks ago, traditional powerhouse Dartmouth—which failed to make the conference playoffs last season—has hit a rough patch. The Big Green has now dropped three straight after starting the season 6-1, though those losses came at the hands of respected programs in Harvard and Boston College. Dartmouth gets the weekend off as the Big Green skaters prepare for exams.
6. Rensselaer (5-8-4, 3-3-0, t-7th)
The Engineers have been inconsistent this season, topping Quinnipiac and St. Lawrence while falling to weaker teams like Princeton and Brown. Rensselaer has been off playing mediocre CHA teams for the last few weeks, earning three ties and a win in four games with Niagara and Syracuse, and the Engineers are welcomed back to the ECAC with a set against conference doormat Union. For now, at least, life’s pretty good at Rensselaer.
7. Clarkson (6-8-3, 3-1-1, t-5th)
Overtime is a concept the Golden Knights have become comfortable with in the last few weeks. Three of Clarkson’s last four games have gone longer than 60 minutes, but unfortunately, extra time has not brought extra success, as the Golden Knights settled for draws with lowly Brown and Vermont and allowed a golden goal against Yale. Clarkson bounced back with a 4-0 win over the Catamounts on Sunday, giving it a two-game unbeaten streak heading into a weekend at Colgate and Cornell.
8. Yale (3-7-2, 2-3-1, 9th)
First-year coach Joakim Flygh finally got his team on a bit of a roll in November, as the Bulldogs had won three of four games before falling to Quinnipiac in the Connecticut-based Nutmeg Classic final. Though Yale’s had some good showings thus far—including a tie with Harvard in the conference opener—it’s still a rebuilding team that has a ways to go.
9. Princeton (3-9-1, 3-5-1, t-5th)
The Tigers haven’t won a game since Nov. 6, with their only point in that time coming in a 2-2 tie with Harvard on Nov. 13. Princeton’s had a rough schedule over the last two weeks, facing both the Big Red and Boston University on the road, and it managed to hold Cornell’s powerful offense to a single goal in a 1-0 loss. But the Terriers’ 8-2 thrashing of the Tigers last Friday couldn’t have helped morale much.
10. Colgate (5-11-0, 2-4-0, t-10th)
The Raiders have also spent the last few games off in CHA-land, coming away winless in games with Syracuse and No. 4 Mercyhurst. Colgate’s struggling defense, which is allowing nearly three goals per game, is making life tough for a rejuvenated offense which has scored multiple goals in four of its last five games.
11. Brown (2-6-2, 1-3-2, t-10th)
The Bears managed to string together a four-game unbeaten streak early in November, but that’s been replaced by a three-game losing streak since Nov. 20. Brown’s offense has scored more than two goals just once this season, and that was against Sacred Heart, a team that doesn’t even play a full Division I schedule.
12. Union (1-11-1, 0-5-1, 12th)
Poor Union. At least Brown’s beaten a true D-1 team: the Dutchwomen’s only win so far has come against Sacred Heart. Union’s averaging just 1.23 goals per game and can’t capitalize on the .934 save percentage goalie Kate Gallagher has put up, which is third-best in the ECAC. It seems like the Dutchwomen are doomed to another season of doormat status.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night’s Harvard men’s basketball game started out just like any other: a pass from sophomore point guard Brandyn Curry into the post to junior co-captain Keith Wright for two points.
But by the time the final buzzer brought an end to the Crimson’s 80-57 trouncing of Fordham (2-4) last night at Lavietes Pavilion, it was clear Harvard (5-1) had relied on an entirely different weapon to put points on the scoreboard.
Instead of relying on its post presence as it has throughout the season, the Crimson let it rain from beyond the arc, finishing with 15 three-pointers—two shy of the program record set in 2002. Five different Harvard players connected from deep on the night, shooting a combined 56 percent.
“We had a lot of open looks, and we moved the ball well,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was just a nice offensive rhythm.”
Freshman Laurent Rivard led the way, finishing with five treys on the night. After scoring just four points in the first half, Rivard caught fire in the second, notching a career-high 21 points on 5-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc.
“I love that Laurent really got off tonight because he works so hard and he’s such a great shooter,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “It’s about time something started falling for him.”
The Rams could not keep pace offensively, connecting on just 23.5 percent of its 17 three-point attempts while missing nine free throws.
Fordham finished with just 57 points, its second lowest offensive output of the season. The Crimson, meanwhile, notched its second highest scoring total of the year by shooting at its highest mark from long range.
But despite the lopsided outcome, it took some time for Harvard to take control of the game.
Wright netted three quick baskets to start the contest, but the Rams kept pace in the opening minutes, thanks to a pair of tough finishes in the paint from Fordham’s Chris Gaston. A trey from Alberto Estwick put the Rams ahead 10-6, but the Crimson answered with back-to-back three pointers from McNally and junior forward Andrew Van Nest.
Sophomore Kyle Casey—playing in just his third game since suffering a broken foot during the preseason—brought the crowd to its feet on the Crimson’s next possession, finishing a baseline two-handed slam to put Harvard up 14-10.
But Fordham’s Brenton Butler followed with a runner off the glass and a three to take back the lead.
From there though, it was all Crimson.
After Estwick missed his next three-point attempt, Harvard pushed the ball up the floor, where Curry found Casey open at the top of the key. Without hesitation, Casey let it fly, sinking the deep ball to give the Crimson a 17-15 lead.
“[Casey’s] gaining his rhythm back,” Amaker said. “You just see the growth.”
Casey’s shot ignited a 23-6 Harvard run over the next 8:04 of play.
Sophomore Christian Webster scored seven of his final 18 points during the stretch, getting four points from the charity stripe.
Van Nest capped off the run with 4:51 left in the half, sinking an open look from the perimeter off a pass from Wright.
The Crimson went into the break with a comfortable 13-point lead, but the Rams threatened early in the second period.
With 17:03 to play, Gaston pulled his team within eight, finishing with a two-handed flush in traffic off an inbounds play.
“He’s a workhorse in there,” Amaker said of Gaston, who led the Rams with 14 points and 10 rebounds. “We were trying to see if we could keep him off the glass.”
But eight was as close as the visitors would get, as Rivard nailed his first of five threes on the ensuing possession, knocking down an open shot from the right corner off a pass from Casey.
“My shots were wide open all the time so I can’t really take credit for them,” Rivard said. “My teammates moved the ball really well.”
Harvard continued to find open looks, connecting from deep four times in a stretch of 2:07 midway through the second period.
“[Fordham] didn’t play that many guys so I think they started wearing down defensively,” McNally said. “And we were just being unselfish and moving the ball around.”
Rivard’s fourth three with 8:19 left sealed the win, putting the home team up by 27.
“We’re all good shooters,” Rivard said. “[The ball] just went in today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of one of many long rallies with Dartmouth sophomore Chris Hanson, Harvard freshman Gary Power played the ball directly into the bottom right corner of the court. The ball hit just above the tin and quickly dropped, bouncing just out of reach of Hanson’s racquet.
With that final point, Power claimed victory over the 2010 first-team All-American at the No. 1 spot, helping the No. 5 Crimson men’s squash team (3-0, 2-0 Ivy) extend its undefeated streak to three matches. Harvard defeated the seventh-ranked Big Green (3-1, 0-1) last night at Barnaby Courts by a score of 7-2.
“I was not just delighted with [our team’s] performance, I was proud of the behavior of both teams,” Crimson coach Mike Way said.
After the first game of the No. 1 men’s matchup—a narrow 12-10 victory for Powers—the final match of the day began to draw a crowd. As nearby contests finished, players on both the Harvard and Big Green sides trickled over to Court 1, overflowing the stands until every player and all of the spectators glued themselves to the match.
Hanson won the next two games, 11-9 and 11-8, respectively, after the pair traded points for the majority of both sets. In the fourth game, Power took control, dominating his opponent, 11-2, before eventually securing the final game, 11-7, to claim victory.
“That’s some of the best squash I’ve ever played,” Power said. “I’m really happy with the outcome, because [Hanson] is a very good player.”
The entire Crimson team looked strong as it handed Dartmouth its first Ivy League loss. Sophomore Zeke Scherl rebounded after dropping his first game of the night to secure one of Harvard’s seven victories in four games. In addition to Scherl and Power, five other Crimson players also claimed victories over the Big Green, with freshman Brandon McLaughlin posting an especially impressive performance at the No. 3 spot in the lineup.
But the team victory for Harvard did not come without difficulty. Dartmouth gave the Crimson its first true test of the season, picking up wins at the No. 2 and No. 5 spots. The overall team match was closer than it looked, as the Big Green took nine sets against Harvard players.
At the No. 2 spot, senior Richard Hill dropped a tight match to Dartmouth, 3-1, despite winning the second game by a score of 11-5. Captain Reed Endresen was similarly defeated by his Big Green opponent, 3-0.
“This [Dartmouth] team is much better than they come across,” Power said. “[Their number seven national ranking] doesn’t quite do them justice, because we’re really close to them.”
“This weekend, we’re playing Rochester and Cornell,” he continued. “They’re No. 4 and No. 6 in the country, so I think this match has really prepared us well for the weekend.”
Each member of the Crimson freshman class remains undefeated in his college career, as the four rookies in the lineup defeated their Big Green counterpart by a collective score of 12-3.
“The freshmen are doing extremely well,” Way said. “Of course, the two top freshmen, Gary and Brandon, are such that they’ve brought this dimension, this new aspect to the team.”
“I’ve said it before,” he added. “But, they’re very instinctive players and they’re very attacking players. These aspects [of their style of play] rub off on the players you would classify as more defensive.”
Last night’s matches, particularly the No. 1 and No. 2 contests, featured a greater number of lets and strokes than the typical squash match. Though numerous controversial calls increased tension between competitors, Way was impressed with his players’ composure throughout the match.
“There was some maturity that I saw tonight that I hadn’t seen in some other matches with some players,” Way said.
Harvard appears ready to continue its quest for an Ivy League title after last night’s key victory over Dartmouth.
“[Tonight’s win] builds more confidence and the single biggest thing in sports is confidence,” Way said. “Of course, because it’s a tough match, there’s also a mindset that helps players prepare for [subsequent tough matches].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scandal and controversy that surrounded last year’s matchup was absent last night in Harvard’s 9-0 sweep over Dartmouth, but it was certainly not forgotten.
Last season, the women’s squash team was subjected to a series of inappropriate slurs and derogatory remarks aimed at them from two Big Green frats in the crowd at its game in Hanover, N.H. The language was so offensive that Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim wrote a letter of apology to University president Drew G. Faust and both squash teams.
“We were determined, as was the Dartmouth coach, [to have] the behavior [be] at the standard that it absolutely should be at, and it was,” said Harvard men’s squash coach Mike Way on this year’s rematch at the Murr Center. “I’m extremely impressed by the sportsmanship on both sides.”
Needless to say, without a trace of any bad blood in the air from last year’s match-up, the first-ranked Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) was able to pull out its overwhelming victory without a hitch.
Losing just one game the entire night, the Crimson, in the words of its top player, sophomore Laura Gemmell, “dominated” the Big Green (1-2, 0-1) in nearly every aspect of the match.
“It’s an important win because we want to win the Ivy League title, and so we had to beat Dartmouth,” Gemmell said. “They’re not our main rivals in the Ivy League—we have Princeton and Yale—but they’re a pretty strong team.”
Despite Gemmell’s confidence in her undefeated team, Way noted that while Harvard’s talent was certainly superior to its opponent, some players faltered in their mental performance.
“There were a couple who didn’t play mentally well at the beginning, but then pulled it out,” Way said. “[Junior Cece Cortes] had to pull herself together, [captain Alisha Mashruwala] did, and Laura didn’t play well mentally either. I always tell the players, ‘If you don’t have your A game, then you have to learn how to win with your B game. And we had some of those cases tonight.’”
In the No. 1 position, Gemmell, ranked as the best player in the nation, faced off against Big Green sophomore Valeria Wiens, also ranked among the top 10 players in the country.
Leading the team in a suitable fashion, Gemmell swept Wiens in three games, 11-7, 13-11, 11-7. Gemmell called it her toughest match of the season so far.
“The last schools we played…their number ones were strong, but not nearly as strong as her,” said Gemmell, who is undefeated in games for the season.
The match was characterized by a series of runs, best illustrated in the second game when Gemmell held Wiens at match point from a five-point deficit.
In the No. 3 slot,  Mashruwala’s mental hiccups early in her play cost Harvard its only loss of the night, as the senior was narrowly defeated, 9-11, by Dartmouth sophomore Corey Schafer.
“I was a little inconsistent in the beginning,” Mashruwala said. “I lost some patience during the long points. I went for too much too soon.”
But, fortunately for Mashruwala, she managed to bounce back and eventually claim the match, 3-1, by going on the offensive and using Schafer’s patient playing style to her advantage.
“She’s a really defensive player, and I’m very offensive...so it was just me playing my game, which is a lot of attacking from the middle and the front and holding the ball.”
With its fourth straight 9-0 victory under its belt, the Crimson have coasted through the season thus far. Way emphasized that games such as last night’s are merely building blocks toward the Ivy League title.
“Right now, what do these matches do? They build confidence,” Way said. “There’s so many things that go into confidence building, but nothing beats winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After garnering two gold medals in its first competition at the Garrett Open hosted by Penn State two weeks ago, the women’s fencing team took on Tufts in a duel bout last night. The Crimson emerged victorious by a 20-7 advantage, despite having junior co-captain and defending national champion Caroline Vloka and All-American Noam Mills sidelined for the match.
In the opening bout against Penn State, Vloka took the gold medal in the sabre, showing a promising start for another national title run. Freshman Alexandra Kiefer, who also won a gold medal in the foil against the Nittany Lions, had a strong performance again last night, leading the weapon group to a 9-0 win. Kiefer allowed only one touch scored against her even though the bout was only her second as a collegiate athlete.
“Kiefer stood out again, but [she] admitted she was nervous,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “However, she came out very strong.”
Also contributing to the success in the foil was junior Shelby MacLeod and sophomore Katherine Chou.
Two more standout performers who stepped up in the absence of Vloka and Mills were junior Hailey Levitt and sophomore Alexa Fishman, who fought in the sabre and epee, respectively. Levitt, like Kiefer, had only one touch scored against her and filled in for Vloka.
“Hailey was brilliant in the meet; technically, tactically, she was 100 percent,” Brand said. “She is the most improved player we have.”
Fishman took Mills’ place and won two out of her three bouts to secure a close 5-4 victory in the epee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time this season, Harvard men’s basketball fans caught a glimpse of the Kyle Casey of old. In his third game back since suffering a broken foot during the preseason, Casey finished with a season-high 13 points and six rebounds.
“He came up to me before the game and said he was feeling really good and that he was loose,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “I was like, ‘Oh man, this guy’s about to put some shots up.’”
It didn’t take long for McNally’s prediction to be proved right.
The first possession after Casey checked in with 14:43 to play, the 6’7” forward took a pass in the left corner, up-faked, drove baseline, and finished with a thunderous two-handed slam in traffic.
“That play kind of showed that he’s not thinking about the foot as much,” McNally said. “That was really good to see, and I think that will be something that he can build on as he goes forward.”
After missing his next two shots, Casey converted on a deep ball in transition off a pass from classmate Brandyn Curry to put the Crimson up 17-15.
Before the night ended, Casey knocked down two more three pointers, shooting a perfect three-of-three from deep.
But Casey’s teammates still think it will take some time for the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year to get back to the point he was at before suffering the injury.
“He’s definitely not where he was in the preseason,” McNally said. “He’s a hard worker.  His game improved a lot from last year, and I have full confidence that in the next few weeks he’ll be right where he needs to be.”

Amidst the end-of-semester whirlwind of finals and papers, there remains a light at the end of the tunnel: J-Term. Use these four weeks carefully; it will be the only time during the academic year in which an excess of sleep, food, television, and sunlight won't prompt automatic guilt. But in case you feel like abdicating your beach chair and sunscreen a little earlier this year, we've got a round up of some of the programs that Optional Winter Activities Week can offer you from Jan. 16-23.
Hack Harvard
Hack Harvard is an incubator for web applications that improve campus life, like many CS50 final projects. Participants will work on their projects from home during winter break and then at campus during OWAW. The project will provide workspace, funding, HBS mentors, and training on advanced topics like scalability and marketing. Once the apps launch, the Undergraduate Council will help to publicize them on campus.
Enrollment Limit: Around 10
How to apply: RSVP is available here.
Deadline: Dec. 11
Harvard Wellness Project
This project presents itself as an opportunity to raise awareness about the consequences of all of the unhealthy behavior associated with college. The issue of how to live a healthy life at Harvard will be addressed in a five-day conference during OWAW. In addition to holding discussion groups and workshops, the developers of the project hope to be joined by experts from across the larger Harvard community.
Enrollment Limit: 30
How to apply: Fill out a short application here.
Deadline: Dec. 8
Spoken Word Workshop
If your solitary musings beg to be further explored, this project offers participants the opportunity to spend a week writing, discussing, and rewriting their own spoken word pieces, culminating in an optional—but highly encouraged—performance at the end of the week. Other highlights will include a guest performance and an expedition to the Cantab Lounge's weekly poetry night. Bonus: The Harvard Calendar notes that snacks will "of course" be provided.
Enrollment Limit: 20
How to apply: RSVP to spokenwordextravaganza@gmail.com.
Deadline: Dec. 22
Watercolor Workshop
Doodled absent-mindedly all over your pset? Well, it's happened to the best of us. Continue to express your artistic tendencies in this workshop, which will explore watercolor as a medium of expression. Participants will work primarily from still-life set-ups, with accompanying individual and group discussions and critiques.
Enrollment Limit: 15
How to apply: Dec. 8-9, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. at the Office for the Arts (74 Mt. Auburn Street)
Throat-Singing Workshop
This project challenges you to come sing two notes—but at the same time. Throat-singing, or overtone singing, is a musical form popular in Central Asia. Practitioners are able to manipulate their voice to emphasize a whistle-like overtone above the fundamental note, effectively singing at two pitches simultaneously. The Harvard OWAW calendar adds that no prior experience or singing talent is necessary, except an "inability to be embarrassed by ridiculous sounds."
Enrollment Limit: 15
How to apply: RSVP to kbseah@fas.harvard.edu. Spots are first come, first serve.
 
First-Year Leadership Initiative
For all of the freshmen out there, you can spend OWAW developing your leadership skills. In the morning, participants will reflect upon their own leadership. In the afternoon, students will be able to choose two of the following workshops: conflict resolution, public speaking, teamwork, making presentations, and goal-setting. These freshmen will also enjoy a reception with Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 and learn from the experiences of distinguished keynote speakers.
Enrollment Limit: 50
How to apply: A link to RSVP will be put up on the FDO's website.
Deadline: Dec. 10
Story and the means of "Telling It" with Roland B. Tec '88
Join a two-day workshop with writer, director, producer, and composer Roland Tec '88, who will guide students in exploring the various modes of communication necessary for effective storytelling. Participants will each bring a story they would like to relate on screen or on stage, and they will be directed to explore the story through four distinct communicative tools: pure dialogue, interior monologue, descriptive prose, and silent screenplay. Tec will also discuss the practical issues of producing theater and film projects, based on his decades of experience as an independent filmmaker and theater artist.
Enrollment Limit: 20

With the deadline just one week away, the 525 students enrolled in  Computer Science 50 are scrambling to complete their final projects.
As they attempt to create websites, Facebook applications, Blackberry  and Android games, and other technological projects, many students are  experiencing challenges. "I know what I want to do. Now how do I do it?"  asked Heather V. Hawkes '13. She added, however, that the feeling of  getting it right at last is "incredibly fulfilling."
In the past, several CS50 final projects—such as I Saw You Harvard and CS50 Lecturer David J. Malan '99's own final project Shuttleboy—have become campus mainstays.  Current students say they hope to replicate this success.
Amelia Q. Friedman '14 is working on a website called "Harvard Groups,"  which will feature reviews of various student groups' comp processes. "I  just thought it would be nice if freshmen could get an honest  representation of different comps," she said.
On Ian S. Anderson '14's site, students will find a list of concerts in  the Boston area. "I always hear about these concerts after they happen,"  he explained, adding that he hopes to help other students avoid missing  shows.
Nancy Chen '13 is making a map compiling the best campus spots to study,  hang out, and nap. Her favorite nap spot? "Cabot Library," she said.
We’ll be revisiting these and other projects later in this series. Stay  tuned for our coverage of the CS50 Hackathon tonight and the CS50 Fair  on Dec. 10!

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
 
 
CORRECTION: An  earlier version of the Dec. 2 blog post "CS50 Final Project Rush" incorrectly stated the domain name that  Heather V. Hawkes ’13 is working on for CS50. In fact, Hawkes has not  yet published to the Internet.

As the Cambridge weather nears freezing and our workloads call for all-nighters, one thing remains constant in the life of nearly every Harvard student's diet: the burrito.  In this mini-series, we’ll be posting detailed reviews and rankings of grilled chicken burritos from four different establishments (Boloco, Chipotle, Qdoba, and Felipe's) while judging on criteria ranging from temperature to tortilla thickness. By the end, we hope to have made the lives of inebriated wanderers and starving studiers a little easier, while offering an easy tool for Reading Period procrastination—burrito rankings.
 
Burrito #1: Boloco’s original classic Mexican burrito
 
Includes: Chicken, tomato salsa, cilantro, cheese, pinto beans, and Boloco rice, all wrapped in a flour tortilla.
+25 points for giving the rice a special name.
Price: $6.25
-200 points for changing the menu and draining poor college students’ bank accounts.
Weight: 1 lb, 3 oz.
+75 points for a sizable portion.
Tortilla: Flavorless and exceedingly chewy. Does not sufficiently retain heat.
-100 points for an odd stretch factor and for failing to keep the burrito toasty warm.
Rice: Moist, but lacking zest.
+100 points for adding succulence, -50 points for nonexistent flavor.
Guacamole: $1.50
-50 points for pricey, yet necessary, guac.
Chicken: Bland.
-300 points for tasteless protein, which should be playing a starring role.
Cheese: Shredded and unsavory—unclear whether cheese was even in the burrito.
-200 points. No melty goodness to be found.
Extras: Cranberry sauce (is this Thanksgiving?) and sour cream (too soupy) are free.
-50 points. Strange selection, stranger taste.
Hours of operation: 7 a.m.-11 p.m. daily
+100 points for offering literal “breakfast burritos,” -300 for closing before the hours that we need burritos most.
Deals and steals: Frequent free burrito days, Boloco Card discounts, and offers for Harvard students—perhaps we can expect a "Snowloco" sometime soon?
+100 points for community spirit, +500 points for loving Harvard, +1,000 for free food!
 
The bottom line: The Boloco burrito experience was underwhelming. None of the individual components performed particularly well and they never came together as one tasty, cohesive bite. Though Boloco offers an extensive menu of smoothies, shakes, salads, and breakfast items, the classic grilled chicken burrito was not up to par.
Total points: 650
Final Ranking: 4/4

Winter Formals are fast approaching, and regardless of whether you have a date or plan on going solo, there is one thing most girls have in common: the search for the perfect dress.
For those of you who have not yet found the dress, fear not. Styleta at Harvard is hosting a Formal Dress Swap and Trunk Sale on Friday, Dec. 3 from 12-4 p.m. on the fourth floor of 67 Mt. Auburn Street.
For five dollars, participants will be able to borrow the perfect frock for their formals, and some dresses will also be available for purchase. If you want to loan one of your dresses out for others to borrow, you can bring them to the swap and see if Styleta is looking for more dresses. Our guess is that they are—the more the merrier!
Everyone is encouraged to lend out a dress (or two, or five), and as an added incentive, the swap fee is waived if you bring three. All proceeds from the dress swap will go to charity, so share your designer duds and swap away.
