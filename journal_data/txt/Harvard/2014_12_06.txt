After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Where are the great men of the Renaissance?/We spend our days discussing restaurants!/ Our daughters dress like whores, our sons are rude/These kids can’t scratch their own initials, dude!”
The time is 1666, and you are sitting in a Paris salon among corseted women and foppish dandies. However, as indicated by the lines above, you are not listening to dialogues in standard 17th-century verse. The humor is undoubtedly right here, right now in Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “School of Lies,” a new play that will open at the Loeb Experimental Theater and run from Dec. 5 to Dec. 13.
Based on a modern rewriting by David Ives of Molière’s “The Misanthrope” the production is a satirical romp of French aristocrats who engage in preposterous battles of the wits as they try to win the heart of beautiful Celimène. This flirtatious widow is the best verbal acrobat of all until the misanthropic Frank—a young French man who resists the bootlicking attitude of the others by devoting himself to brutal candor—comes along and flips her world upside-down.
“The plot and characters are definitely from Molière, but the satire is now tackling 21st-century problems,” says Sara K. Rosenburg ’16, who plays Arsinoé, Celimène’s antagonist.
As director Archie I.H. Stonehill ’17 sees it, the play also contains more timeless ideas: “The hypocrisy [of] social interactions was a major theme in Molière’s time, and I’d say it is still very relevant today.”
Despite incorporating terms from the modern internet and texting lexicon, the production has preserved Molière’s rhythmic verses and rhyming couplets. “Much of the play’s humor comes from the anachronisms thrown in the text,” stage manager Victor J. Kamenker ’17 says. “Where else does one find words like ‘dude’ and ‘LOL’ in complete verse?”
Besides the carefully crafted verbal comedy, the production promises other forms of fun that will be sure to entertain a 21st-century audience. “There’s some intellectual humor for sure, but there’s also some great gross and raunchy bits.” Rosenburg says.
Scatological and sexual humor aside, there’ll always be the age-old crowd pleaser of slapstick. “Much of my job as a stage manager of this play has been keeping people on their toes with the rhyme and meter to make the jokes and innuendos as enjoyable as possible,” Kamenker says. “But there’s also some visual comedy that just cracks me up every time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 5, 2014, at 8:30 p.m.
Harvard University IT experienced “intermittent outages” for several hours Friday, with many Harvard affiliates unable to access external websites on University wifi for much of the morning and early afternoon.
The network outages were completely resolved by the late afternoon. HUIT is continuing to investigate the “root cause” of the problem, but does not believe the outages were sparked by any malicious attack, according a statement on the department’s website.
HUIT’s updated services dashboard page suggests that the “intermittent outages” were due to “heavy [Domain Name System] traffic.” In a statement posted at 3 p.m. Friday, the department wrote that it had taken “remedial steps” that improved internet access, but that the outages may not have been completely fixed because it had yet to find the “root cause” of the problem.
DNS servers typically direct the website url to an Internet Protocol, or IP, address.
HUIT first issued an alert around 11 a.m. on its website about the outages, which it said began at 10:30 a.m. Friday. Shortly after 1 p.m., Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan wrote an email to FAS affiliates saying that HUIT was “aware and actively working to address this issue presently.”
Kirwan wrote that HUIT would offer updates as they work to fix the outages.
For most College students, news of the widespread nature of the outages came over House email lists. Friday is the second day of the fall semester’s reading period.
Students on at least one House email list sent out messages around noon, instructing users to modify their DNS server preferences in an effort to solve the outage. HUIT later recommended that any affiliates restore their original DNS preferences to preserve access to Harvard resources.
The Office of Student Life has extended the deadline for winter recess housing applications from Dec. 5 to Dec. 8 because of the outages, according to the office’s website.
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde sent his own email to College students shortly before the end of business hours Friday instructing students concerned about completing an assignment on time due to the service interruptions to reach out to his or her resident dean.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore center Sean Malone returned to the ice with a power play goal and two assists as the No. 9/8 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (8-1-2, 4-1-2 ECAC) defeated Princeton (2-8-1, 1-6-0 ECAC), 4-3, at Hobey Baker Memorial Rink on Friday.
After missing the first 11 games of the season, Malone scored a backhander at 1:35 in the third period to break a 2-2 tie and give the Crimson its final lead of the night. Five minutes later, he assisted classmate Tyler Moy on another power play goal, which would prove to be the game-winner.
“It was stressful at the beginning of the season not playing,” Malone said. “I’m glad to be back and I think I showed that last night.”
With leading scorer Alex Kerfoot out of the lineup for the first time this season, Harvard welcomed Malone’s return. The reigning co-Ivy League Rookie of the Year led the Crimson on a challenging night for the visitors, who peppered Princeton goaltender Colton Phinney with a season-high 55 shots yet struggled to create separation on the scoreboard.
The Crimson jumped out to a two-goal lead early in the second period, but Princeton drew even by the middle frame’s end.
Defenseman Brayden Jaw struck first for Harvard with his first goal of the season at 13:52 in the first period. The junior beat Phinney with a strong shot from the point off assists from junior forwards Luke Esposito and Greg Gozzo.
At 6:52 in the second period, freshman forward Jake Horton pushed the Crimson’s lead to 2-0, powering a drop pass from Malone on the rush at the top of the right slot.
Despite being outshot more than two-to-one, Princeton climbed back into the game in the second half of the second period with a pair of strikes from defensemen.
Sophomore Tommy Davis picked up the Tigers’ first goal of the night on the power play, beating Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek blocker-side with a wrist shot from the top of the right faceoff circle. Freshman Joe Grabowski followed at 18:16, knocking in a rebound after Michalek lost his footing stopping an initial two-on-one opportunity created by forwards Max Becker and Kyle Rankin.
Both goals were collegiate firsts for the blue liners. Princeton’s best defender on the night, however, was in net. Phinney finished with a career-high 51 stops, turning away flurries of Harvard opportunities throughout the game.
In the third, Malone and Moy gave Harvard a new two-goal lead to defend. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey extended his point streak to 11 games with the primary assist on Malone’s goal. Moy passed his freshman goal total from last season at 6:39 in the period with his fifth tally of the season.
After converting on two of four power play opportunities on the night, Harvard has now scored on 32% of its chances this season, tops in the ECAC. Quinnipiac has the next highest conversion rate with 23%.
“We’ve been really successful [on the power play],” Malone said. “Even when we have guys out, we have other guys that can step in and produce.”
Senior Princeton forward Aaron Kesselman cut Harvard’s lead in half with just over three minutes left in regulation, but the visitors held on for their fifth straight win. With the victory, the Crimson moved into sole possession of second place in the ECAC. The team will visit first place Quinnipiac on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With his team down three and less than 90 seconds remaining in regulation, sophomore Corbin Miller watched as teammate Agunwa Okolie’s high-arcing trey soared through the air and ricocheted off the rim. Miller sunk down towards the baseline, positioning himself for the rebound.
Somehow, in traffic moments later, 6’2” Miller came up with the board. He found junior co-captain Siyani Chambers waiting, hands up, on the right wing, and Chambers showed no hesitation in pulling the trigger. The triple was good, knotting up the score, 44-all, and sending the Crimson and University of Vermont men’s basketball teams into extra time.
Then it happened again.
With 16 seconds left in overtime and Harvard down three once more, senior wing Wesley Saunders received a pass from Chambers, before sending the rock to Miller, who was waiting between the top of the key and the right wing. Miller forced up a contested, fade-away three-pointer that fell through the net as the sophomore was still falling backwards. 50-all. The teams were headed for another five minutes of play.
Finally, for the first time all night, Harvard was able to create some breathing room in double overtime. The Catamounts (4-4, 1-0 America East) would score only once in the last five-minute period, enabling the Crimson (6-1) to put the game away with a steady stream of layups and free throws.
It took two overtimes and two clutch triples from its backcourt, but when the final buzzer sounded, it was visiting Harvard that came out victorious, 64-52, Saturday night at Patrick Gymnasium in Burlington, Vt.
“We knew [tonight’s game] was going to be very challenging and very difficult,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “[I]t took a great deal of concentration, a great deal of composure, and I thought it took a great deal of confidence for us to finish this game.”
In a game in which neither team shot above 36 percent from the field or 64 percent from the charity stripe, it’s perhaps unsurprising that neither side led by more than three points for the entirety of the second half.
With both squads struggling to connect, each made basket gained greater significance. And after Vermont failed to score a single field goal between the 10:24 and 3:45 marks of the second half, its three consecutive layups within two minutes of play seemed, comparatively, like an offensive onslaught. With those six points, the Catamounts took a three-point lead with 1:46 left in regulation, setting up Chambers’s trey 40 seconds later.
“[Chambers] has a tremendous amount of belief, and I think he relished being in that situation, that moment where he had to do something for us at a critical time,” Amaker said. “And he certainly did that. We wouldn’t have asked for anything more than that—hitting a big three to tie it.”
But Vermont would have one more chance to steal the game before the buzzer rang, and turned to freshman Cam Ward to do so. With 36 seconds left on the clock, Ward sent up a high floater over co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi’s outstretched fingers. The shot clanked off the rim, and Miller once again came up with a timely board, sending the ball to Chambers who brought it up the floor. The point guard handed the rock to Saunders along the perimeter, who found Moundou-Missi open on the baseline. The big man caught the ball and put up the shot, drawing contact but no whistle. The shot failed to fall, and the game went into its first extra period.
Neither team managed to score a field goal in overtime until Vermont put in a layup with 2:07 to go. Saunders responded immediately, spinning down the left side of the lane and knocking down the bank shot to give Harvard the one-point lead, 47-46.
A Catamount three-pointer from Kurt Steidl and free throw from Trae Bell-Haynes, however, put the home team back in control, 50-47, with just 33 ticks to play.
But then Saunders found Miller for that fade-away, high-arcing triple to tie the game once more.
Bell-Haynes couldn’t respond to Miller’s trey, missing a layup on the next possession. As the teams then traded turnovers on the ensuing inbounds passes, five more minutes were added to the defensive stalemate.
It was only then that Harvard broke the game wide open.
The Crimson won the tip, and senior Kenyatta Smith immediately found Miller open on the arc for a deep three-pointer to put Harvard up, 53-50. Vermont’s layup on the following possession would be the last time it would score on the night, as Saunders shouldered the offensive burden to put the game away.
After the Catamounts’ bucket, Saunders received the ball from Chambers, spun on his defender’s back, and sunk a fade-away bank shot. Just over a minute later, he tipped in Chambers’s missed layup, giving his team a five-point advantage and all but sealing the victory.
“It was just one of those games where [it comes down to] which team is going to wilt a little bit,” Amaker said. “I thought once we were able to get a two-possession lead in the second overtime, it changed the dynamic of things.”
Saunders’s strong play continued a season-long trend for the wing, as he once again led the Crimson in scoring with 25 points. The senior almost doubled the Catamounts’ total number of steals, nabbing seven to Vermont’s four. Saunders was helped down low by Moundou-Missi, who totaled a career-high 17 rebounds in 38 minutes on the floor.
On the defensive end, Harvard tallied 10 blocks and 14 steals, marking season-highs in both categories. It also held the Catamounts to only 30.5 percent shooting from the field, a season-low for any Harvard opponent.
“We were putting so much energy on the defensive end to lock in and try to defend,” Amaker said. “[This was] just a terrific game…a hard-fought game in a hard-fought environment against a ball club that [has had] a tremendous amount of success.”
