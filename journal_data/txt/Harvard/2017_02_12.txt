After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s starting to sound like a broken record, but once again on Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team needed a second half rally to overcome a double-digit deficit in order to put a tally in the win column. This time around, it was a 25-6 run over Brown, sparked by 18 second-half points from freshman guard Bryce Aiken, that pushed the Crimson (13-7, 5-2 Ivy League) past the Bears (11-12, 2-5), 87-74.
The Crimson has yet to lose the front end of an Ivy weekend this season. However, the trend of starting slow and need second half comebacks has made Harvard coach Tommy Amaker wary.
“I wish we could play better prior to [the second half]. I don’t know what the heck that is,” Amaker said. “It’s not a formula we’re trying stay with the rest of the year, we’re not going to be as fortunate. I think we need to play smarter and better prior to the second half, but I am proud of our guys for settling in and showing some composure.”
ROOKIES RUN THE SHOW
The freshman pair of Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns have led the offensive charge for the Crimson for much of the season, as the duo sit atop the lineup in terms of points per game. That pace did not slow on Friday night, as the pair combined for 40 of the team’s 87 points.
While the rookies took on the heaviest offensive burden, both scored in spurts. The first half was all Towns, as he scored 12 of Harvard’s 15 points over a span of 5:40 in the second half. Despite the hot streak for the forward, the Crimson defense struggled on the opposite end of the floor, making it impossible to create a lead.
“It started with him getting to the foul line,” Amaker said of Towns’ offensive burst. “His first points, I believe, were from the foul line and I think that really helped him calm down and get a rhythm offensively.”
Aiken, on the other hand, had just five points in the first half, but burst onto the scene in the second. The New Jersey native thrived on his ability to beat defenses from a variety of ways. Of his 18 second-half points, three came from behind the arc, seven from the free throw line, and the rest from a variety of driving layups and mid-range jumpers. Of the trips to the free throw line, Aiken got there from drawing fouls in the paint and drawing contact on his jump shot.
“STAY READY SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO GET READY”
This is the line that Amaker has used with his bench players to keep them focused in the game, even when they aren’t seeing significant minutes.With the addition of seven freshmen this year and losing only three players to graduation at the end of last season, Amaker has a plethora of players to work with. With the freshmen contributing at a high level early, however, that has meant that some players who previously saw significant playing time have had to take on a new role with the team.
Two players who have experienced a shift in their playing time have been senior forward Zena Edosomwan and sophomore forward Weisner Perez. While Edosomwan has been the bigger name after averaging nearly a double-double last season, Perez also came in for significant minutes during certain games when Harvard needed a smaller forward to improve its matchups. Edosomwan has given up some of his minutes—and his starting role—to freshman forward Chris Lewis, while Perez has moved farther down the bench, with freshman Robert Baker taking on a bigger role as a four who can also shoot from outside the paint.
But on Friday night, Edosomwan and Perez came in in the second half and provided a defensive energy that allowed Harvard to distance itself from the Bears. The duo combined for 14 of the team’s 21 second half rebounds, while Edosomwan also tipped in eight points for the visitors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 12, 2017, at 2:40 a.m.
NEW HAVEN, CT—Behind chants of “Let’s play football,” the Harvard men’s basketball team accomplished something no team has done in nearly two years—beat Yale at home.
Just over 11 minutes into the second half, freshman guard Justin Bassey drove inside and kicked the ball out to classmate Bryce Aiken in the corner. Aiken threw up a three as he was fouled by sophomore guard Alex Copeland—the shot fell and Aiken made the free throw to give Harvard a 55-53 lead and hush the crowd at the John J. Lee Amphitheater.
“It was a terrific pass,” Aiken said. “Terrific pass off his penetration, he kicked it to me in the corner and I let it fly. At first, I wasn’t sure if the ball went in or not, I asked my teammates, they helped me up—but terrific pass and blessed enough to make that shot.”
The Crimson would lead the rest of the way, but for the Bulldogs the game was far from over.
Despite Aiken scoring Harvard’s next four points, freshman guard Miye Oni kept Yale in the game as he hit a jumper and then came right back with a three to cut Harvard’s lead to just a point with 7:22 left on the clock.
Much like it has over its last few games, the Crimson waited until late in the second to close out the game.
It began with a layup from senior center Zena Edosomwan. On the next possession, sophomore guard Corey Johnson connected from deep. Co-captain Siyani Chambers then hit a three of his own and on the ensuing possession drove inside and laid one up off the glass.
Over a span of just over three minutes, the Crimson went on a 10-2 run to take what would be the largest lead of the night at 71-61 with 2:24 left on the clock.
The Bulldogs (14-7, 6-2 Ivy League) came within four after rattling off six unanswered points, but Chambers and Aiken closed out the game at the line to give Harvard (14-7, 6-2) the 75-67 win in New Haven.
“These games are incredibly competitive and obviously we’re fortunate to come out on this side tonight,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “But both teams did incredible things to make this a sensational night for Ivy League basketball. I think our league is a tremendous conference, you start top to bottom, you see some quality teams.”
Despite the late game heroics from Aiken and company, Saturday’s matchup began as a much closer affair. In the first half, Harvard and the Bulldogs traded shots early and often—for the Crimson the offense came courtesy of Aiken from deep and for Yale it was senior forward Sam Downey inside.
A late 8-4 run from the Bulldogs in the first gave them their largest lead of the game at eight, but Aiken answered with a three to cut the deficit to five at the half.
Aiken finished the first half with 12 points on 3-of-6 shooting from beyond the arc while Downey closed out the period with 12 of his own and 11 rebounds.
Early on in the second, however, the Crimson struggled to find an answer to Copeland. Over a period of three minutes, the guard drove inside for eight of the 11 points that Yale would score in that span. He finished the game with 20 points, two rebounds, and an assist on 8-of-12 shooting.
“We’ve known that [Copeland] is very quick,” Amaker said. “Quick feet and he can stop on a dime. He’s got good size for a ballhandling guard so he can shoot over top of others. But he turns the corner really well, incredibly explosive.”
For the Crimson the win came largely as a result of its two guards—Chambers finished the game with 16 points, six assists, and three rebounds while Aiken finished with a season high-27 points, three rebounds, and two assists.
For Harvard, the occasion also marked the first time since February of 2015 that the Crimson swept an Ivy League weekend road trip.
“I’m glad we were fortunate enough to get the win but like coach said and like Bryce said they’re a great team,” Chambers said. “It’ll be a tough challenge when we play them again when we see them at our place.”
