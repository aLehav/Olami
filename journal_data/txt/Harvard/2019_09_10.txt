After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colson Whitehead did not intend to write a heavy, difficult-to-read book, but that’s exactly what “The Nickel Boys” became. Not that there’s anything wrong with that: The novel is a superb read that repeatedly shocks the reader even though it shouldn’t given America’s history of racial violence that continues into the present day. Whitehead writes as any good author should: He envelops the reader into the world of his characters until one reaches a state of familiarity, only to jolt him or her with phrases, sentences, and paragraphs that perfectly express Whitehead’s sentiment of choice, be it shock, fear, injustice, or passion.
“The Nickel Boys” starts out hopeful in a way that signals that things will go wrong very quickly. Elwood is a teenager awakened to the Civil Rights movement by Dr. Martin Luther King, and is described in a way that intensifies his naïveté. On his first day attending college classes as a high school student, he accepts a ride in a car that — unbeknownst to him — is stolen. He is complicit simply by being in the car and is soon sent to Nickel, a facility described to visiting inspectors as a reform school, but which is really the site of unfathomable abuses made all the worse by the racism of Jim Crow era.
Though Nickel is fictional, it is modeled on a school that existed in Florida from 1900 to 2011, around which Florida officials found bodies and unmarked graves. Many of the remains are from black boys, yet few of the bodies have been identified. The state has not yet issued a public apology, in a move that should surprise no one, but dismay everyone.
Turner, one of the only friends (of sorts) that Elwood makes in Nickel, is his polar opposite: cynical, disbelieving of the system, and convinced the only way to get out of Nickel is to bide one’s time and protect oneself at the expense of all else. This bond proves to be a lasting one — and one that keeps both boys sane — as they watch students disappear.
It isn’t often that novels portray sound as effectively as Whitehead does. Yet when he conveys the sound of the fan in the room where beatings take place, he does so with clarity and precision — it permeates the entire campus grounds, and while Elwood can initially take comfort in not knowing why Nickel officials deploy it in the first place, this innocence doesn’t last long. The fan can be heard all over, but in a twist of cruelty, when boys about to be punished stand right next to it, they can hear everything the officials say.
Sound recurs repeatedly throughout, especially the forced silence of the boys who would do anything to get out but find their humanity dulled and destroyed. The narrator, writing from the present day, says as much in a manner that is too bitter to be ironic: “Most of those who know the story of the rings in the trees are dead by now. The iron is still there. Rusty. Deep in the heartwood. Testifying to anyone who cares to listen.”
The end of the novel — which will not be revealed here — is itself a testament to and lament of the dehumanization and deeply entrenched racism which Whitehead chronicles on every page. Naïveté and blind hope cannot protect in the face of hatred: manufactured determination and self-inflicted desensitization perhaps have a better chance. Whitehead points out, however, that this change in boys so young is one of the biggest crimes of all, and is a lesson that follows the men in the story even once they have managed to leave or escape.
“The Nickel Boys” may be fiction, but a similar school was once real, and de facto open in the twenty-first. Elwood’s story points that out to an audience that otherwise, tragically, would not have known, and demands that we confront the legacy of pain that would have otherwise been forgotten.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Jeffrey E. Epstein’s death by apparent suicide while imprisoned on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy, many articles about the disgraced financier include pictures of Epstein donning Harvard apparel. Epstein was not an alumnus, faculty member, or even a Harvard affiliate, yet he boasted long-standing ties to Harvard faculty and a history of donating millions of dollars. After Epstein’s first conviction in 2006, Harvard said it would not return his gift. It has made no change to this statement in the interim.
Once again, Harvard should be grappling with the ethics of accepting a donation from a morally-questionable source. As it does so, Harvard must critically evaluate the full extent of its relationship with Epstein, considering not only the millions of dollars that he directly gave to the University and its affiliates, but also the relationships he forged with University faculty. In conducting this evaluation, Harvard must further recognize that accepting a donation at a given point in time not only legitimates the donor’s reputation, but also implicitly condones what they stand for in perpetuity, unless the University takes clear, decisive action to demonstrate the contrary.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has recently taken such action with their donations from Epstein. MIT issued an apology for accepting the money in the first place and promised to donate the same amount of money to charities that benefit victims of sexual abuse. One of the individuals most closely affiliated with Epstein at MIT, Joichi Ito, even resigned in the aftermath of revelations about the extent of his dealings with Epstein since his first conviction.
While there are crucial differences between the MIT and Harvard cases — most notably that Harvard received Epstein donations before his 2006 conviction and MIT continued accepting them well after — MIT has set a useful precedent for dealing with Epstein’s donations. Harvard should consider following MIT’s lead and donating at least some portion of the monies received from Epstein to charities supporting victims of sexual assault, sexual violence, and sex trafficking.
Regardless of whether Harvard heeds this advice, the University absolutely bears the responsibility to make a concrete statement denouncing its ties to Epstein. People increasingly associate Epstein with Harvard — not least because of pictures in the media of him in Harvard apparel — and Harvard has done little to nothing to distance itself from the convicted sex offender who also allegedly ran an organized child prostitution ring. Not only did this continued silence further Epstein’s reputation while he was alive, it is also unfair to current Harvard students who must live with the knowledge that Epstein touted his affiliation with their school while University administrators stayed — then as now — silent.
The Epstein case raises serious questions about how a well-connected member of the social elite can use donations to cloak himself in prestige while hiding unspeakable depravity. Harvard must take meaningful action to demonstrate, to students, faculty, and the nation as a whole, that it recognizes the role the University played in that legitimation. That action must signal a seriousness of intent to avoid repeating this mistake.
Whether it be donating to charities or some other method of atonement, no comment is simply no longer an acceptable answer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dental insurance is not really insurance. Your health and car insurance are ways to reduce your risk of large, unforeseen payments. You make regular small payments and in return you don’t have to pay for a new car if you are unlucky and get into a major crash. Your insurance covers that. Yet, at Harvard, dental insurance doesn’t work that way. Harvard’s dental plan for graduate students for the 2019-2020 academic year has a premium of $558 for an individual. In return, dental services are fully or partially covered. That biannual cleaning? It’s free when you have insurance.
But two cleanings will only cost you $207 when you go to Harvard Dental Services without insurance. If you are a particularly diligent dental patient, you may anticipate an annual exam with X-rays. That costs $175 out-of-pocket. So, even if you follow all the recommended annual care, you will save $176 dollars by opting out of the student dental plan.
At this point you may still hesitate to forgo insurance. What if you get in the equivalent of a dental car crash? Maybe a lifetime of candy consumption will finally catch up with you. Won’t you be happy in that event to have insurance to protect you from financial hardship?
Maybe.
The plan has a $1,500 plan-year maximum and a $50 deductible. A dental filling costs between $180 and $400. So let’s say you need one filling that costs $250. With insurance, you would pay $50 to cover your deductible and then 40 percent of the remaining cost ($80). Together with the $558 you paid as a premium, you’ve incurred $688 in total expenditures.
Had you instead paid for two cleanings, X-rays, an exam, and the same tooth filling out-of-pocket your total expenditures would have been $632. You save money by opting out of insurance. Even if we increased the severity of your dental misery to two fillings at a total cost of $400 dollars, the savings from having dental insurance is only $34.
You would have to spend at least $343 on basic benefits such as fillings or crowns above all routine preventative care to break even with insurance. This break-even point jumps to $635 if you only intend to get two cleanings in a given year. At most, dental insurance affords you $1,324 in savings (at 40 percent coinsurance) compared to paying out-of-pocket for care because of the plan-year maximum.
With a low plan-year maximum and coinsurance at 40 to 60 percent, dental insurance doesn’t provide the same financial protection as your car insurance. Reframe dental insurance as a pre-commitment payment plan rather than insurance.
As a patient, I used to treat medical and dental appointments as a one-way conversation. The doctor knew what was best and it was my responsibility to follow her advice. As a health policy researcher, my conversations have evolved. I ask my doctors about why they are recommending care and if there is flexibility in the timing and intensity of treatments.
Cost-benefit tradeoffs are personal and complex. The full list of benefits available in the Harvard plan are available online and are worth reading to fully understand how dental insurance can and cannot provide financial protection. These issues are not unique to the Harvard student plan but are systematic characteristics of most dental insurance plans available in the individual market. Premiums are high relative to the financial protection you buy. If the idea of paying for two cleanings (or additional care) is financially untenable, there are cost-effective options at local dental schools such as Tufts University or Harvard.
We are bombarded with financial decisions every day. Dental insurance need not be a difficult one. There are cases where dental insurance makes sense. There are also lots of cases where a graduate student should rationally opt-out. Every year, take stock of your expected needs and think through what dental insurance will really buy you. In any given plan-year it buys you up to $1,500 potential protection. To incentivize you to stay, that can reach up to $3,000 with year-to-year rollovers.
Dental insurance is optional. Optional insurance plans attract two types of individuals: people who expect to need care like multiple fillings or dental implants that warrant the insurance premium and deductible, and people who wouldn’t rationally buy insurance based on their expected needs.
I’ve been in each of these groups. If you are in the latter category and you are up for it, take a chance this year. Pay out-of-pocket for dental care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I lingered at the edge of the hallway next to my professor’s door, a homey office tucked away in the meandering halls of the Barker Center. It was my first time attending office hours for a class — and I was only doing so because he had made it mandatory.
My professor arrived late. He was on his phone as he rushed through the door without a second glance, motioning for me to follow him into his professional abode with large, untranslatable sweeps of his arms. I was terrified.
As our conversation unfolded, however, so too did my apprehension. I eventually found myself sitting in his office for three hours, far longer than the allotted appointment. I remember watching the sun set, casting shadows on my professor’s wrinkled forehead as he expressed admiration for the rhetorical moves of Frederick Douglass. There was nothing similar between us, nothing I could grasp onto; but there was something special in probing his mind and basking in the passion that oozed from the sentences he so easily constructed.
I have never understood how to navigate the politics of office hours. I’m a pretty outgoing person, but there’s something about speaking intimately (or even just speaking) with the leading expert on Frederick Douglass, or American imperialism, or graph theory, that I just can’t seem to get past. I never know if I’m smiling too much, sitting upright enough, or if my legs are crossed just right. And the questions: What kinds of questions could ever justify 30 minutes in the presence of a MacArthur “Genius Grant” or Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, 30 minutes they could spend working towards their next breakthrough? And what happens when I run out of questions, when the awkwardness settles in? I am horrified of merely sitting there, smiling dumbly, staring anywhere but their eyes, to prove that I’m worth this sliver of their time.
My experience isn’t unique. Most first-generation students, students of color, and even freshmen struggle with this form of elite networking, one that is so ingrained into interactions between students and non-students at the College.
No one has ever trained us to engage with prestige, to use long words and “gesticulate,” to slide Faulkner references into casual conversation. When interactions with our professors become crucial stepping stones towards opportunities at Harvard and beyond, it can feel like there’s too much to lose from a bad impression. Often, we opt not to make an impression at all.
My experience is also specific to the social sciences and humanities, which have more seminar-style classes that provide an opportunity to engage directly with professors. Friends tell me that the difficulties of office hours are especially salient in STEM classes at Harvard, which tend to be larger lecture courses or labs, where the primary mode of instruction is not discussion-based. When peer-to-professor interaction is not actively encouraged, students can fail to see the merits of attending office hours, perpetuating their fear of taking the first step themselves.
Some of the problem arises from the fact that students from disadvantaged backgrounds often get to Harvard by proving that they don’t need help, that they can do it all themselves, that they can be the best despite it all. But these stigmas can be debilitating and unsustainable, especially when it comes to the unspoken powers of connections and self-care.
Whenever I meet with freshmen, I try to do my part in chipping away at this cycle. I always mention that they can ask me anything, that I’m there to help and support them. I’ve found that with every new reminder, they become more willing to text me questions, internalizing that I actually care about them.
Encounters like these have taught me that the person in power must take the first step. More professors should emphasize that office hours can be a space for low-stress conversations — all it takes is a short reminder at the end of every class that students are free to sign up for sessions, whether it’s for help or for a friendly chat.
By demonstrating intentional and obvious respect for students both in the classroom and during one-on-one conversations, professors can help shape a new culture with their students. While these solutions cannot eradicate the intricate cultural, social, and economic barriers that comprise the educational accessibility gap at Harvard, making it the norm for students to be themselves within academic spaces is the first brick in a bridge that many students are usually forced to build alone.
As the evening closed, I found myself walking with my professor out of his office, through the halls, down the sweeping, marbled staircase at the Barker Center. I hadn’t done anything during the meeting except prompt, nod, smile; but there was this sense of accomplishment in my heart as we parted ways, as the brisk Boston breeze carried me back to my room in Pennypacker Hall.
Since then, that joy has become commonplace, helping me build relationships with professors willing to share their words and mentorship with me without asking anything in return. I only wish more professors would try to meet students where we are, unfolding their lives to us one crease at a time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard College opens its new Academic Resource Center, some undergraduates worry it may not be able to offer mental health-related services comparable to those offered by its predecessor, the Bureau of Study Counsel.
After Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh announced the opening of the ARC in June, she and Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Sindhumathi Revuluri said the move marked a shift away from the BSC’s “hybrid model,” which sought to address both students’ academic and personal circumstances.
At the time, Revuluri said the BSC’s counseling was not in line administrators’ beliefs that the center should have a primarily academic focus.
“It came about at a time when we did not have institutionalized or robust mental health services. And so things like the Bureau of Study Counsel took on a much more kind of advisory, mentorship, pastoral role, which actually meant that there was a lot less focus on academic issues,” she said.
Since classes resumed and students learned of the BSC’s impending closure, some of the office’s undergraduate users criticized the change. Many noted their positive experiences with the BSC’s approach to academic counseling and cited long lines at Counseling and Mental Health Services.
Madison A. Trice ’21 said she believes the BSC provided a needed service at the intersection of academic and personal issues at the College. She added that she hopes the ARC will employ clinically trained staffers, offer tutoring across all disciplines, and aid students who enter Harvard needing additional academic preparation.
“The BSC was capable of providing additional emotional support, as it pertained to academic matters, and pretty much everything at Harvard is an academic matter,” she said. “I think that there is a need for more than just academic support.”
Revuluri wrote in an emailed statement Sunday that the College’s move does not represent a shift away from mental health more broadly.
“The opening of the ARC does not represent a new shift away from health or mental health. Rather, the ARC is a reinvestment in learning and learning support that is informed by the most recent research and practice in the area,” she wrote.
“We continue to work closely with our partners in [Harvard University Health Services] to ensure that mental health services are available to any student who may need them,” she added.
Benjamin I. Sorkin ’20, who has participated in academic counseling and group programming at the BSC, said he believes that the BSC filled a gap in mental health counseling at the College.
“They were, I think, a largely helpful resource and a place where a lot of people looked to when CAMHS wasn't offering what they were looking for,” he said. “I've heard much more positive feedback from the counseling and services offered by the BSC than a lot of what people were getting over at CAMHS.”
Students have previously criticized long wait times at CAMHS, though the office piloted a program to streamline appointment-making in an effort to remedy the issue last year. CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis has previously said CAMHS has been able to schedule an initial consultation with 80 percent of students within 48 hours of hearing from them.
Frances Hisgen ’21 — who both tutored at the BSC and used its services — said she thinks the Center’s model reflected the nature of students’ academic concerns.
“I'm skeptical that conversations about your relationship to learning and where other identities intersect with learning are best held in sort of a clinical mental health setting like CAMHS,” Hisgen said. “Because often, it's not a chronic condition or an illness that's being treated, but rather something a little bit more broader and about the whole person.”
Claybaugh’s June announcement informed students that the ARC would open in August and the BSC would permanently close in December. The centers’ websites both direct students seeking academic support this semester to the ARC.

Luís Roberto Barroso, current justice of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil and senior fellow of the Harvard Kennedy School, warned that advances in technology will pose new dangers to Brazilian and American democratic institutions in a speech at the school Monday evening.
He said the development of artificial intelligence — which he called the “fourth industrial revolution” — will prompt urgent questions about the proper limits of freedom of expression on the internet, including ways to combat hate speech and fake news.
These innovations are “redefining what it means to be human,” he said.
Barroso also argued that technological innovations in the 21st century will spur debates about the bioethics of cloning human beings, buying and selling human organs, and creating genetically-engineered organisms.
He said the coming decades will increase the need for plans to address climate change.
Barroso’s talk — entitled “Technological Revolution, Democratic Recession, and Climate Change: The Limits of Law in a Changing World” — marked the first in a series of lectures that the Kennedy School plans to sponsor throughout the 2019-2020 academic year addressing technology and ethics in the modern world.
Director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy Mathias Risse decided to launch the series in response to the book “Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,” by MIT Professor Max E. Tegmark, which explores upcoming challenges that technology could create.
Event attendees said they thought Barroso provided global context to the questions surrounding democracy, climate change, technology ethics.
“I’m interested in climate change — especially from a public policy perspective so I just came to learn more about that and see other students that are interested in it,” Kennedy School student Sam Elghanayan said. “Today mixed in a lot of different components so I think it tried to put climate change in a larger context of what’s going on in the world today.”
For Kennedy School student Alex DeVille, the talk provided an opportunity to learn about how democracies can respond to the challenges of the 21st century.
“I think that what it came to at the end was how to push for it [democracy] — if you want to preserve democracy, but I think that the debate seemed reasonably open about, like, ‘Are there other ways of doing this?’” DeVille said.

Cambridge emergency responders briefly cordoned off a large portion of Harvard Square Monday evening following reports of a “suspicious package” in the Harvard Square MBTA station, according to police on the scene.
The station later reopened after an investigation, according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
“The Transit Police investigated a possible suspicious package at the T Station and during their investigation the Harvard T Station was briefly closed. The item was deemed safe following their investigation and the area has been reopened to normal activity,” Warnick wrote in an emailed statement.
MBTA and Transit Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.
At 6:03 p.m., the MBTA posted on Twitter that trains would bypass the Harvard Square station “at the request of police.” Multiple vehicles from the Cambridge Police and Fire departments soon lined the intersection of JFK Street and Brattle Street, blocking vehicle traffic.
Cambridge police officers and MBTA transit police gradually herded curious pedestrians and disgruntled commuters across the street. Some commuters speculated as to the causes of the delay, while others simply glanced at their phones. At one point, more than 50 people had gathered along JFK Street to watch the responders’ activity.
Laura M. Nicolae ’20 said that she was taking the T back from a class at MIT when the train’s path was altered.
Nicolae said the conductor informed passengers that it would not stop at the Harvard Square station “because of police action.”
Nicolae added that passengers were concerned with the news and that people were “rushing off the train” when it arrived at nearby Central Station.
As the sun set on Harvard Square, officers repeatedly expanded the area of their cordon, which began merely blocking the station entrance but at one point extended across the entire center island of the Square.
Molly R. Newcomb, who works for Harvard’s Alumni Affairs and Development office and was waiting for the station to re-open, said that she takes the train home from work every day.
She said rumors were swirling around the crowd as to the cause of the closure, and that she thought “it could be anything” with the T.
“As we all know, there’s been a lot of problems,” Newcomb said.
A few minutes after 6:45 p.m., officers began allowing traffic to return to the Square and informed T passengers that they were safe to enter the station again.

The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration — celebrated this April for producing the first-ever image of a black hole — received the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics Thursday.
Astronomy lecturer Shep S. Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led the team of 347 prize winners, among whom the three million dollar award will be evenly apportioned.
Nearly three hundred scientists operating across 60 institutions and 20 countries produced the seminal and singular image, according to a press release.
Several dozen of these collaborators were Harvard affiliates, according to Doeleman.
“It's been a 20 year odyssey to realize this black hole imaging breakthrough,” he said. “The team here at Harvard, really, has become part of the nucleus of a lot of the effort.”
EHT postdoctoral fellow Dominic Pesce said that he is gratified that the Breakthrough Prize committee recognized each individual member of the group.
“It's not common to see such...large prizes and such big name awards really acknowledging the work of an enormous group of people at the level of individual members of that group,” he said. “To me, that was really something special.”
Physics, Philosophy, and History of Science Professor Peter L. Galison ’77, a collaborator on EHT, said coordination between hundreds of scientists is standard in particle physics, though more “unusual” in astronomy.
“It's not a trivial matter to get all those people come to meetings and talk to each other and be persuaded that the result is not an artifact,” Galison said.
Galison added that imaging the black hole, located 53 million miles away, required “a complicated coordinate of activity.” The project — which he analogized to someone in Boston reading the date on a quarter in Los Angeles — entailed coordinating telescopes across the globe in order to imitate a lens the size of the Earth.
Center for Astrophysics electrical engineer and EHT collaborator Jonathan Weintroub said that the team started small and grew as telescopes were added to the project.
“That was just this sort of tight knit group of people trying to do something extraordinary. And then what happened is we needed more telescopes to make the image,” he said. “And so representatives of all those sort of cultures and regions of the world came on board.”
Inaugural member of Harvard’s Black Hole Institute and EHT collaborator Michael D. Johnson said the sheer scale of collaboration was both “challenging” and “rewarding.”
“We really had to find these airtight arguments where 200 people, or 300 people, could agree on a single takeaway,” Johnson said. “Retaining that group consensus is a really challenging process. But in the end, it's also tremendously rewarding, because there's really a sense of unity.”
Lindy Blackburn, radio astronomer and EHT data scientist at the Center for Astrophysics, said that the group was “humbled” by the thrill the image elicited among the public.
“I don't think any of us could have anticipated the level of interest we got from the public,” he said.
Johnson said that he was also pleased with the general interest the image piqued.
“I think, as researchers, we’re always driven by intrinsic sense of wonder for these problems, but they’re not generally broadly appreciated,” he said. “Usually, you need a Ph.D. just to understand why someone cares. Here, 10-year-olds can find inspiration in the same way as the researchers who are working on it.”
Astronomy Ph.D. student and EHT collaborator Daniel C. Palumbo said that he is grateful to have participated in such a rare “public-facing research experience.”
“I think there'll be a generation of astronomers or simply appreciators of the night sky who see this image and imagine what might be peaking out us from across the cosmos,” he said.
Despite the public appreciation, Black Hole Initiative fellow and EHT collaborator Maciek S. Wielglus said the team was nonetheless surprised to receive the Breakthrough Prize.
“People didn’t really expect this type of recognition — maybe at least not just a few months after the discovery,” Wielgus said. “Usually big discoveries are waiting many years to get the recognition.”
Doeleman said more big discoveries are on the horizon.
“How are we going to take this still black hole camera, and turn it into a motion picture camera? How are we going to make the first movies of a black hole?” he asked.
Doeleman will accept the Breakthrough award on behalf of his team Nov. 3 in a televised ceremony, termed the “Oscars of Science,” according to the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council reiterated its core mission of inter-school collaboration, advocacy, and event-oriented programming at its first open meeting of the semester Monday night.
Helmed by fresh faces — president Bryan O. Buckley and vice president Chanthia C. Ma — the meeting highlighted multiple new partnerships with other student organizations across the University, including the Undergraduate Council and the Graduate Commons Program. The council — which comprises members from each of Harvard’s 12 graduate schools — also created a new executive board position and passed its budget for the 2019-2020 academic year.
Buckley and Ma opened the meeting by announcing HGC’s new relationship with the Graduate Commons Program, a body within the Harvard University Housing Office that organizes graduate student life events. Lisa Valela, the program's director, said at the meeting she will work as an “event consultant” to help HGC plan, fund, and organize large-in-scale inter-school programming.
“What is HGC? It’s the convening of graduate students,” Buckley said. “Harvard is quite wide and very decentralized. It’s very important as we follow our mission to bring graduate students together that we find strategic partners that can help us with our mission and know the landscape.”
HGC will also start collaborating with the Undergraduate Council. The two bodies are hosting Veritas Cinema, a forthcoming film and philosophy series. The UC further connected HGC to the College Events Board, and Buckley said he is confident that collaboration with undergraduates will continue.
“One of the things you saw pass in our budget was being able to have meetings with [the UC] to see if we can think about some of our programming in a collaborative way,” Buckley said in an interview after the meeting. “Whether it's a mentorship program or a speed-dating career type event.”
Buckley also announced the council will appoint members to the External Advocacy Committee in the coming weeks. Created last spring, the EAC is the lobbying body of the HGC and releases statements concerning everything from Boston politics to news coming out of Washington, D.C.
“Anything that can’t be changed by us internally to Harvard, but we’d like to have a stance on, the EAC will be our policy platform,” Buckley said.
The council unanimously voted to pass a budget of $151,020, the majority of which will be used for “student engagement.” Roughly 58 percent of the budget will fund events for students to interact and meet each other, according to Kelly E. Menjivar, an interim member from last year’s HGC board.
Buckley also proposed the creation of a new HGC position — Executive Person at Large — which the council approved. The new office will be responsible for advising HGC to ensure internal accountability and efficiency, according to Buckley.
Buckley closed the meeting by repeating his desire for HGC to bring together students from across the University.
“One of the platforms I used when I ran for president was to think about people, process, and programming, into that theme of how do we collaborate with other people around us,” Buckley said. “Harvard’s really a place that’s inclusive, and I think that inclusive culture has to begin with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students wrap up shopping week and faculty finalize course enrollments, several instructors in the College’s new General Education program say they are confused and frustrated by a rule capping their classes at 250 students.
At the same time, the Gen Ed office is working with Harvard University Information Technology, the Advising Programs Office, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office, and the Office of Undergraduate Education to create a “better” Gen Ed lottery system, program director Laura E. Hess wrote in an email Monday.
The offices began developing the new lottery system this summer and hope to debut it in spring 2020. The new system will run through my.harvard and will allow students to rank course choices and “visualize their lottery participation,” according to Hess.
“This functionality should result in most students being matched with their most desired courses, and eliminate situations in which some students get into multiple courses while others don’t successfully lottery for any,” she wrote.
Currently, students must enter separate lotteries for each course in which they wish to enroll.
Hess’s announcement comes at the same time as multiple faculty criticize — and say they were caught unaware by — the Gen Ed program’s imposition of lotteries on large Gen Ed classes.
Per a decision last spring by the FAS Standing Committee on General Education, the Gen Ed office capped its courses at a maximum of 250 students. The Gen Ed office only implemented lotteries on courses for which “past or early enrollment data” indicated interest might exceed 250 students, and professors can choose to impose smaller enrollment caps if they wish, according to Hess.
GENED 1058: “Tech Ethics: AI, Biotech, and the Future of Human Nature” is the only Gen Ed course that has an enrollment cap larger than 250. The class — which is listed in my.harvard as having a cap of 900 — is an “experiment” in increased Gen Ed course sizes, according to Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology professor Amy J. Wagers, who co-chairs the Faculty committee on Gen Ed.
The new enrollment limits come amid a broader overhaul of the College’s Gen Ed requirements which began in 2015 and rolled out this semester. Under the new requirements, students take four general education classes and three departmental classes in the sciences, humanities, and social sciences.
Wagers said in an interview Monday that the caps are meant to increase interactions between students from “different peer groups” in Gen Ed classes.
“While it is conceivable that one could achieve those kinds of interactions in a larger group, it's more challenging,” Wagers said. “As enrollments increase, you have smaller groups that coalesce and then you're less likely to move outside of your normal peer group, and participation becomes harder in the common dialogue of the class.”
Comparative Literature professor John T. Hamilton wrote in an email to prospective enrollees in his course, GENED 1020: “Security” that the Gen Ed program capped enrollment for his course after more students than originally expected attended the first class.
“I'm not entirely happy with the situation, but I have to respect the decision of the Gen Ed committee,” Hamilton wrote.
Psychology professor Jason P. Mitchell, who teaches GENED 1154: “The Science of Happiness,” wrote in an email to prospective students Friday that he has been “supremely frustrated” by the imposition of lottery process, its timing, and the clarity of his communications with the College about it, adding he wants to let “as many [students] as possible” into the course.
“I wish I knew what was going on, but my queries to the College about the timing of the lottery have gone unanswered,” he wrote. “I’m doing my best to open the course to at least 250 students, although I am now being told that Harvard may not have sufficient resources to support such a large enrollment.”
The Standing Committee on General Education first told instructors last spring that they would limit enrollment in Gen Ed courses to 250 students, according to Hess. “Further communications” during the summer and fall “reiterated this commitment,” she wrote.
But Medical School professor Charles A. Czeisler ’74 said he feels the office’s communications with faculty about course caps leading up to the semester were ambiguous. Czeisler said that based on conversations he had with the Gen Ed office about booking a larger classroom for his course GENED 1038: “Sleep,” he believed it would not be capped — and told the several hundred students who attended the first meeting as much.
Czeisler said he asked for a waiver to the rule but was denied and that his repeated efforts to get the cap removed took time away from his course preparation.
“I stood up there and told the students that they didn't have to worry about a cap, and now this cap is being imposed,” he said. “I tried to plead my case in various ways.”
Wagers said she understands instructors’ frustration, adding that “faculty have to be a bit flexible” as the fledgling program gets off the ground.
“We did the best we could to try to inform faculty where we were going with this,” she said. “I understand that email is difficult for people and sometimes the details get lost in an email, and I can understand if if faculty missed those points.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Volley goals, flip throws, and complete control. Could you really ask for more?
After a masterful 3-0 performance against Quinnipiac, the Harvard women’s soccer team returned to the pitch to follow up with another dominant 2-0 win in its first-ever game against the Northwestern Wildcats. Despite a relatively close score, it was clear that the Crimson had the overall advantage throughout the game due to its relentless offense, overwhelming defense, and great goalkeeping from senior goalkeeper Kat Hess.
However, despite owning possession and fending off attacks from the Big 10 opponent, this was by no means an easy game. While over 1,000 fans sat in the stands on a nice Sunday afternoon, the women on the field battled through intense competition that only got chippier as the game went on. So much so, that the physicality and aggressiveness escalated to a point that elicited much discontent from fans worrying it could boil out of control.
Yet, the intensity only seemed to drive Harvard even more, as junior forward Murphy Agnew and first-year forward Angela Caloia continuously pierced through the Wildcat defense and pressuring their keeper.
Finally, at the 32:15 mark, the Crimson broke through with a beautiful goal from sophomore midfielder/forward Sophie Hirst on a cross from Agnew. The tie-breaking goal was especially important because, even though Harvard was controlling the game, one small slip up could have resulted in Northwestern grabbing the edge.
When speaking on the timing of the goal, Hirst said, “I think our team felt relieved after I scored because at that point in the game, we were getting chance after chance and we finally converted, so it gave us a second surge of energy to finish the half and the game strong.”
Hirst, who finished second on the team in points last season as a first-year, also spoke to the personal importance of the goal. “It felt awesome to score my first goal in such an important game against a Big 10 team, but I also think it was mostly a feeling of relief to score my first goal somewhat early in the season so I can play more confidently and freely later down the line."
As the first half drew to a close, sophomore defender Jordan Di Verniero made one last attempt at a goal with a flip throw-in from the Wildcat end of the pitch. The move, which she used several times in the game, requires incredible athleticism, and although the ball was cleared out by the NU defense, the play was still talked about by fans throughout the remainder of the game.
The second half began with the same intensity, but this time it only took three minutes and 30 seconds for the Crimson to net its second goal. This one came off the left foot of sophomore forward Trinity Thomas, who also played very well for 80 minutes, after which she was subbed out to a massive ovation.
Northwestern tried to battle back, but the Crimson to thwarted every attack thrown its way, eventually securing their second win (and second shutout) of the young season.
Caloia, who finished the game with two assists, now leads the Crimson with seven points. The first-year is off to a great start, and when asked about the beginning of her collegiate career at Harvard, Caloia said, “The first three games have honestly been such a whirlwind. Obviously we didn’t get the start we wanted with Northeastern, and that was an eye-opener for us. We knew we had the potential, but since then, everyone’s been working that much harder at every practice and I think it’s starting to show on the field. I think the growth already is evident, and everyone is so excited to prove how far we can go. I really can’t overstate the incredible culture of the team. I’ve felt so supported and welcomed every day from all of the returning players, and on game day, the only word I can think of is ‘fun’ because it’s when we get to go out and just play. I wasn’t expecting to feel like I’ve been playing with these girls for so long when really it hasn’t even been a month.”
The team-driven mentality can make a huge difference in any sport, and it seems that this squad is embracing it in every way possible. On Monday, Caloia was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week, but she would not even let this recognition distract from the effort the whole team has been putting in. “I was definitely not expecting it and it feels great, but to be honest, I think the recognition should go to the whole team,” said Caloia. “The performance against Northwestern was huge. I’m extremely grateful and can’t wait to keep getting after it.”
With a 2-1 record, the Crimson is over .500 for the first time this season and looks to continue to build on the recent momentum cultivated by the last two shutouts. With five games remaining until conference play, it appears that Harvard is now hitting its stride perfectly after the initial loss to Northeastern.
Despite the win, no one on the team wants to become content. “Something our team focuses on is to improve with each performance,” said Hirst Meaning,” Even though we got the result, we still find things in that performance that we can learn from and improve in the next game, specifically the quality in the final third since we had so many opportunities and chances but only two goals, and quality in our set pieces. As long as we approach each game with the same intensity and grit, but focus on the little things we try to improve from game to game like technique, we should improve as the season goes on.”
The motivated group will return to the pitch on Tuesday night, where they will face off against another in-state opponent in UMass. If the team continues to play the way they have these past two games, it is going to be an incredibly fun and entertaining season.
Buckle up.

As everyone struggles to find all the best hidden gems and fulfill the new General Education requirements, my.harvard has been hindering those efforts. With its persistent outages, it has left all of us in the dark at some point. Here are eight things that are currently working better.
The New Schedule and Having Time to Eat Lunch 
Those 15 minutes at FlyBy are better than nothing, which is what my.havard is often giving us.
McDonald’s (or the Dhall’s) Ice Cream Machine 
While neither work often, at least McDonald’s doesn’t get mad about its own cookies.
The Class Lottery System 
At least someone, somewhere, is getting to take GENED 1074: “The Ancient Greek Hero” (or so we are told).
Your Last Relationship 
Even Chad was more predictable than logging in to my.harvard.
Going to Networking Events 
We are getting nothing out of both, but at least networking events have free food and your mom will stop texting you about going to a networking night.
Paying Taxes 
Yes, our secondary school system may have failed to teach us this (or other useful life skills), but after 45 minutes and three YouTube videos, the tax system will be clearer and my.havard will still give error messages.
Promising Yourself That “This Semester Will Be Different”
Are you really going to do all the readings? Do you actually think you will make it to every 9 a.m.? No, but it doesn’t matter if you can’t enroll in classes because of a my.harvard shutdown.
Curricle, Syllabus Explorer, and Q-Guide Plus
Now, if you actually cannot figure out my.harvard and it’s getting down to the wire, check out these three sites to plan your semester schedule. Curricle will let you search for classes, Syllabus Explorer will show you a past or similar syllabus, and Q-Guide Plus will let you know what the students really think. This way, all that will be left to do is put the classes in your schedule.
