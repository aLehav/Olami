After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a nearly two-week break from competitive play, the Harvard women’s tennis team heads into spring break with a victory.
On Friday afternoon at the Murr Center, gutsy singles play and dominating doubles helped the Crimson (5-3) blank the New Jersey Institute of Technology (8-4), 7-0, in a match that had just been added to the schedule during the previous week.
“It wasn’t actually scheduled, this match,” co-captain Kristin Norton said. “We had two matches cancelled two weeks ago for ‘Nemo,’ so they just scheduled this one right before spring break just to get a head start on our tennis training. We’re just really excited for the matches to come, and we’re trying to get ready for Ivy season.”
But that the match was rescheduled to right before the break had little effect on the team, which will ride a three-game winning streak into its trip to Florida, where the Crimson will face tougher competition, including a top-20 Stetson team.
“This was another building match for us,” head coach Traci Green said. “We just had midterms, and we’re about to go into spring break, so I think it’s one of those matches where we knew we could win, we knew NJIT was going to fight, but I liked the way we came out strong and stuck to our guns.”
In line one doubles play, Norton and co-captain Hideko Tachibana handled their opponents deftly, using aggressive moves to the net to sprint out to an 8-0 victory after just a half hour of play.
“Hideko and I have been playing a lot of doubles since freshman year, but this year we haven’t really played together in the fall, so it’s really great to get to play together again,” Norton said. “We just have a lot of chemistry, and we know where each other’s going to be on the court without saying anything, so that was great.”
The other two doubles matches were much more hotly contested as the Highlanders’ pairs fought for the doubles point. Sophomore Sylvia Li and freshman Amanda Lin won their first game on court three but dropped the next two to their NJIT foes. Serving for the win at 6-5, Lin committed a double fault, but the rookie redeemed herself with a return winner two games later to defeat Natalia Melibeu and Carolina Zagotta, 8-6, and give Harvard its first point on the day.
Freshman Amanda He and junior Amanda Morrill faced similarly tough competition on the second court. After the Highlanders broke He and Morrill in the first game, the two came back, winning a break of their own. The pairs remained on serve throughout the match, before Li and Lin won the match to complete doubles play.
“We’re a little bit rusty in doubles,” Green said. “We haven’t played for a couple of weeks, so that was expected, but we turned things around in singles and got off to pretty good starts in all of the matches.”
On court five, Li lost the only set of the day in her singles match against NJIT’s Jana Luste. Li swept her first set, using a strong serve to pull out a quick 6-0 win. But Luste came back with a vengeance, and lengthy volleys fell to her favor as the visitor picked up the second set, 6-2.
Li bounced back after the setback, employing deep groundstrokes to alternating corners to tire her opponent. After nearly two hours of play, the sophomore downed Luste in a 6-1 victory in the third set to give her team its sixth point on the day.
“Sylvia was fighting the whole way, and it was nice to see her pull through there at the end in the third set,” Green said.
In line one play, Tachibana attacked her opponent’s weaker serve, dropping only one game in a 6-1 set to open the contest. The match became heated in the second set, with a line dispute leading to a re-played point before Tachibana’s pulled out the set victory, 7-5.
Lin and Norton both made quick work of their foes, losing only one and two games, respectively. At line four, He also found victory, taking advantage of her opponent’s propensity to come up to the net at inopportune times to win, 6-3, 6-3.
Despite playing only two sets, freshman Hai-Li Kong and her Highlanders foe, Melibeu, found themselves to be the last ones playing on the court. After Kong picked up the first set in a 6-2 victory, long, fatiguing rallies led to errors on both sides. Eventually, Kong prevailed, rallying past Melibeu, 7-2, to give the Crimson the final point.
I think everyone had great days,” said Norton of the team’s final match of an eight-game homestand. “I think some girls were disappointed in the way they played, but they were still able to find a way to win, so that’s what counts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 10 Ohio State Buckeyes from the Big Ten.
Record: 23-7, 13-5 Big Ten
Best Wins: vs. No. 3 Indiana, vs. No. 6 Michigan
Worst Losses: at No. 22 Wisconsin, at No. 8 Michigan St
RPI: 14
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 7
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 3
Star Players:  Deshaun Thomas (Jr. Forward) 19.7 ppg, 6.1 rpg, Lenzelle Smith Jr. (Jr. Guard) 10.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg), Aaron Craft (Jr. Guard) 9.7 ppg, 4.5 apg
If Harvard matched up with Ohio State, the game would be a battle of the point guards. Junior Aaron Craft—the former Big Ten Defensive player of the year—is as good a candidate as any to take Harvard freshman Siyani Chambers out of the game. Averaging just under 10 points per game and leading the Buckeyes with 62 steals on the season, Craft may prove too much for Chambers to handle.
This season, the Crimson has lived and died by Chambers’ performances. The team is 3-4 when Chambers scores in the single digits. In addition to being the second leading scorer with 12.4 points per game, Chambers has been referred to as both the “quarterback” of the offense and the “most important player” by coach Tommy Amaker for the way in which he directs the offense. Chambers is one of two Crimson players with the ability to constantly beat defenders off the dribble and his ball-handling ability allows shooting guard Wesley Saunders to flourish off the ball in a way he cannot when Chambers is on the bench. Both times out against Penn, Chambers was held to five points as the duo of Tony Hicks and Miles Cartwright limited his offensive output and forced him to give the ball to less efficient shooters.
Ohio State—on the other hand—has lived and died by its defense. With no consistent second scoring threat behind Thomas, the Buckeyes are known for their aggressive defense, which—when broken down—led to upset losses at the hands of lower ranked teams such as Wisconsin and Michigan State. OSU’s ability to guard the perimeter will make it tough for the considerably smaller Harvard lineup, which has struggled this season to find a consistent post presence.
With sophomore forwards Jonah Travis, Kenyatta Smith and Steve Moundou-Missi going hot and cold at different times, the Crimson has relied on consistent three point shooting from co-captains junior Laurent Rivard and senior Christian Webster. However, matchups at Princeton and Columbia, where missed threes made the difference between a loss and a win, showed the fragility of Harvard’s perimeter game.
The Crimson will be hard pressed to find a way past Ohio State’s defense. Craft’s defensive prowess will mitigate Chambers’ contributions and if its shots from afar aren’t falling the scoring will be forced to come inside, a dangerous position for the Crimson to be in given Harvard’s lack of consistent interior scoring.

But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 7 Kansas Jayhawks from the Big 12.
 
Record: 28-5 (14-4 Big 12)
Best Wins: No. 7 Ohio State, No. 10/11 Kansas State (three times), No. 14 Oklahoma State
Worst Losses: at TCU, at Baylor, at Oklahoma
RPI: 10
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 8
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 2
Star Players: Ben McLemore (Fr. Guard) 16.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg, Jeff Withey (Sr. Center) 13.5 ppg, 8.4 rpg, Travis Releford (Sr. Guard) 11.7 ppg, 3.7 rpg
After reaching the national championship game last year and falling just short against Kentucky, Kansas entered the season with its gaze set on another Final Four appearance. But the team’s roster had two big holes, as forward Thomas Robinson, who averaged nearly 18 points and 12 rebounds last season, and guard Tyshawn Taylor, who put up 17 points and five assists per game, were both lost to graduation. Despite the absences of the departed seniors, the Jayhawks have lived up to the ever-present high expectations for the program by capturing a Big 12 regular season co-championship with rival Kansas State. It represents the fifth straight Big 12 title by coach Bill Self’s Jayhawks.
Part of the reason for Kansas’ success this year has been the production of freshman guard Ben McLemore. Hailing from nearby St. Louis, MO, the six foot five inch guard leads the team with just under 17 points per game and is shooting nearly 44 percent from beyond the arc. Although McLemore has provided a spark for the Jayhawks, veteran leadership still makes up the core of the squad. Indeed, after McLemore, the team’s next four leading scorers are seniors—including Defensive Player of the Year candidate senior center Jeff Withey.
In addition to a potentially exciting showdown between McLemore and Crimson guard Wesley Saunders, another particularly tough matchup for Harvard would come in the paint with Withey, who stands a large seven feet and 235 pounds. Sophomore center Kenyatta Smith would be in for a challenge against Withey, who is averaging 13.5 points and 8.4 rebounds per game.
Kansas has played consistent basketball all year long – with one glaring exception coming in early February. The Jayhawks suffered a close, five-point loss to Oklahoma State, which snapped KU’s 33-game winning streak at Allen Fieldhouse. Four days later, Kansas incurred its worst loss of the season against TCU. The Horned Frogs, which ended with only two conference wins on the year, held the Jayhawks to under 30 percent shooting. The losing streak continued in their next game against Oklahoma, and Sooners fans joyfully stormed the court when the Sooners emerged with a 72-66 victory.
The Jayhawks quickly returned to their former selves after the three losses, and (except for a 23-point loss at Baylor) rattled off a number of resume-building wins. But as is the case with any team, if Kansas struggles shooting the basketball, especially from long range, anything can happen – as TCU can happily attest to. The pressure-packed atmosphere of March Madness can only add to the potential for a team’s relapse into bad old habits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team took the lead first in its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2010. But after finding the back of the net in the first period, the Crimson advantage lasted just 60 seconds. No. 4 Boston College evened the score at one and went on to score two more unanswered goals, besting Harvard, 3-1, Saturday afternoon at Conte Forum.
“You create your own luck with your hustle and the tempo of your game, and we just didn't have it today,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We were just a step behind.”
Despite outshooting the Eagles (27-6-3, 17-2-2 WHEA), 31-24, Harvard (24-7-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) was unable to get any pucks to fall after its first goal came on a power play.
Both squads traded power-play opportunities in the first frame, but it wasn’t until Boston College committed a hooking penalty 16 minutes into the period that Harvard buried the puck in the back of the net. Freshman forward Mary Parker notched the goal for the Crimson, assisted by sophomore Samantha Reber and senior Kaitlin Spurling. The contest was Parker’s fourth consecutive game with a goal.
Harvard’s momentum was almost instantly wiped out, when Eagles forward Haley Skarupa skimmed the puck right under freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer only a minute following Parker’s tally.
“When we scored first, it was a big momentum swing, and we almost made it 2-0 immediately after,” captain Jillian Dempsey said. “Their second goal gave them more energy and put us on our heels, which hurt us.”
Maschmeyer had 21 saves on the day, but it was Boston College senior goaltender Corinne Boyles who led her team to victory with 30 saves, outlasting the Crimson’s third period onslaught.
“I think our shot selection was not at a place where we like it to be,” Stone said. “I think we made [Boyles] comfortable by putting a lot of pucks into the basket... right in front of her. We didn't bury the rebounds, but they were there.”
The second frame belonged to the Eagles. Two minutes into the period, Boston College forward Caitlin Walsh broke free and slammed the puck past Maschmeyer and into the corner of the net.
Harvard continued putting more pucks on net than the Eagles did, and had a break-away opportunity from junior forward Gina McDonald, but with less than five minutes left in to play in the frame, it was Boston College defender Blake Bolden who fed the puck to teammate Alex Carpenter and allowed her to up the Eagles’ advantage to two.
“They cleared pucks, they made it difficult, [and] they blocked a lot of shots as well,” Stone said. “I didn't think we were great offensively at all on entry, in the zone, and in possession. We were okay.”
The Crimson came out of the break firing, getting off a total of 13 shots in the last frame. Spurling gave Harvard another close scoring opportunity off of a breakaway just minutes into the period, but Boyles continued to show her strength after two failed power-play attempts by the Crimson. Harvard received its last advantage at the 16:26 mark, after a Boston College tripping penalty. The Crimson fired multiple shots at Boyles and controlled the puck for almost all of the final two minutes. Unable to find the back of the net, Harvard pulled Maschmeyer with a little over a minute and a half left in the game, but the Crimson could not convert, and the score was finalized at 3-1.
“Unfortunately, a couple of fluke pucks found the back of the net and put us in a hole we couldn't get out of,” Dempsey said.
“I think BC took advantage of their opportunities when they were presented to them,” Stone said. “My hat is off to them. They're a very good team and they handled the momentum shifts of the game better than we did.”
With their victory, the Eagles advanced to the Frozen Four and are set to play No. 1 Minnesota this Friday.
Six Harvard seniors, Dempsey, Spurling, Laura Bellamy, Margaret Chute, Kelsey Romatoski, and Hilary Hayssen, suited up for their final game in the Crimson uniform.
“We have so much heart... I believe in this team, and I know the near future will see an NCAA title brought to the Bright,” Dempsey said. “It was an honor to make it to the NCAAs and to wear the Harvard jersey one more time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 8 Michigan State Spartans from the Big Ten.
Record: 25-7 (13-5 Big Ten)
Best Wins: No. 6/7 Kansas, No. 9/10 Ohio State, No. 6/8 Michigan.
Worst Loss: vs. Connecticut (in Germany)
RPI: 6
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 10
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 3
Star Players: Keith Appling (Sr. Guard) 13.5 ppg, 3.6 apg, Gary Harris (Fr. Guard) 13.2 ppg, 2.4 rpg, Adreian Payne (Jr. Forward) 10.4 ppg, 7.5 rpg
In his most recent projection, ESPN’s bracket man Joe Lunardi has Harvard slated to play three-seeded Michigan State in Auburn Hills, Mich. Of all the opponents in all the locations, this might be the worst possible combination for the Crimson.
Depending on whom you consult, the Spartans may have played the toughest schedule in the country in 2012-13 and showed up for just about every game; their only loss to a team rated outside the Top 25 on the day of the game was to Miami (Fla.), which now sits at No. 9/10 in the polls. A reflection of its self-described “blue-collar” head coach Tom Izzo, Michigan State boasts one of the country’s stingiest defenses, allowing just 87 points per 100 possessions, good for seventh-best nationwide. The Spartans’ offense isn’t too shabby either, at 24th in the country in offensive efficiency with 112.5 points per 100 possessions.
For Harvard, matching up with the Spartans is a nightmare at every position, starting at point guard, where Crimson freshman Siyani Chambers would have to check one of the Big Ten’s best guards in junior Keith Appling. At 6’1” and 190 pounds, Appling has 20 pounds and a couple inches on Chambers, not to mention an advantage in quickness. Appling would be able to get into the lane at will, breaking down the Harvard defense and laying the ball off to the Spartans’ big men.
Ah, the big men—this is where the Crimson’s small frontcourt would be drastically exposed. Michigan State’s two starting forwards are probably the strongest, most rugged players Harvard would have seen all season. Senior forward Derrick Nix weighs in at 270 pounds, and that’s after losing about 40 pounds since his freshman season. Nix combines his prodigious girth with a soft left-handed touch in the lane and some deft post moves that belie his bulk. His counterpart in the paint, junior forward Adreian Payne, is considered an NBA first-round draft prospect for his freakish athleticism and improving outside touch, shooting 45.2 percent from three-point range.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has generally played only one forward at a time this year, but he simply couldn’t afford to do so against these two, likely matching up sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi on Nix and his classmate Kenyatta Smith on Payne. Both Smith and Moundou-Missi would have to be on the court for most of the game, something they’re not used to, if the Crimson want to prevent the Spartans from getting easy buckets down low.
And easy buckets are their specialty. Michigan State’s aforementioned offensive efficiency comes despite attempting 14.6 three-pointers per game, 309th in Division I. Michigan State thrives off the slashing ability of Appling and 6’4” freshman guard Gary Harris, who then distribute the ball to be finished at the rim by Nix, Payne, and explosive 6’6” wing Branden Dawson.
At every position, the Spartans are bigger and more athletic than Harvard. They play a conservative offensive style, not taking a lot of risks and looking for high-percentage shot attempts. And they’ll likely be playing in front of a quasi-home crowd in Auburn Hills, at the home of the Detroit Pistons. If the Crimson draws Michigan State on Sunday, this one could get ugly.

With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 13 Florida Gators from the SEC.
Record: 25-6 (14-4 SEC)
Best Wins: Wisconsin, Marquette, Missouri
 
Worst Losses: at Arkansas, at Tennessee, at Kentucky
 
RPI: 8
 
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 1
 
Projected seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 3
Star Players: Erik Murphy (Sr. Forward) 12.9 ppg, 5.4 rpg, Patric Young (Jr. Center) 10.5 ppg, 6.2 rpg, Scottie Wilbekin (Jr. Guard) 9.2 ppg, 5.0 apg
Currently a 14 seed in Joe Lunardi’s latest bracket, the Harvard Crimson have a good chance of landing an intriguing round of 64 matchup against the puzzling Florida Gators. The Gators, currently given a three seed by Joe Lunardi, are ranked 13th in the country according to the AP poll but are given the number one ranking by stats guru Ken Pomeroy.
Pomeroy’s rankings take into account every possession a team plays, calculating opponent-adjusted defensive and offensive efficiency rankings that create a Pythagorean expectation for the squad. The Pythagorean expectation is a metric that calculates a team’s odds of wining based on its play throughout the season and prioritizes margin of victory over actual wins. As such, Pomeroy is more likely to look at the Gators’ stretch of ten consecutive wins in the middle of the season (including an undefeated January) and ignore their four road losses in SEC play.
The discrepancy between the metric and realized wins on the court is displayed by Lunardi’s seeding of the Gators, who have been up and down throughout league play. In addition to blowing out then-no. 17 Missouri, then-no. 16 Mississippi, and then-no. 25 Kentucky by an average of 21 points a game, the Gators have also lost to fringe bubble teams Tennessee, and Arkansas on the road during SEC play. Playing in a weak SEC that will likely get only one team into the tournament seeded six or lower, the Gators have had few chances to make statement wins. During the nonconference season, they blew out Wisconsin (by 18) and Marquette (by 33) but lost two other games against noteworthy teams, falling by one in Tucson and losing by six to Bruce Weber’s Kansas State squad.
What it adds up to is a team that statisticians and pundits are at odds over, as well as a nightmare first round matchup for Harvard. Looking at the Gators’ six losses, only one came by more than six points. The team boasts a deep rotation where eight players average 16 or more minutes a game and the team pursues a breakneck pace up and down the floor. The Crimson have seen nothing like Florida’s athleticism not pressure in Ivy League play and co-captains junior Laurent Rivard and senior Christian Webster will struggle to contain forwards Mike Rosario and Erik Murphy in the open court.
However, there is a silver lining for Harvard against a squad that has played up and down all year away from the friendly confines of Gainesville. Unlike most other teams that Harvard could play, Florida’s myriad losses on the road signify a tendency to play down to the level of their opponents. Even with a possible win in the SEC tournament final against Mississippi, they will arguably not have played a team of their caliber since December.
Harvard employs a valuable giant killer technique in its three-point shooting and if it can lull the Gators into a slower-paced game that favors the less-athletic Crimson, it will have a chance. While the smart money is on the Gators to repeatedly attack Webster and Rivard on defense, exploiting their speed with their swarming press and full-court attack, Crimson fans can take solace in that the season has already shown this Florida team to be vulnerable to inexplicable losses.

But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 14 Oklahoma State Cowboys from the Big 12.
Record: 24-8 (13-5 Big 12)
Best Wins: at Kansas, Kansas State, North Carolina State
 
Worst Losses: at Baylor
 
RPI: 26
 
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 21
 
Projected seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 5
Star Players: Marcus Smart (Fr. Guard) 15.4 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 4.2 apg, Markel Brown (Jr. Guard) 15.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg
Currently ranked as a five seed by Joe Lunardi, the Oklahoma State Cowboys are an unlikely opponent for the Harvard Crimson. However, with Stephen F. Austin being upset in the Southland final Saturday—and with myriad upsets around the nation in other conference tournaments—nothing is out of the question.
The Cowboys revolve around the performances of star freshman guard Marcus Smart, who is ranked third in ESPN analyst Chad Ford’s latest NBA Mock Draft. Smart does it all for the Cowboys, leading them in scoring, steals and assists and ranking third on the team in rebounding. Smart is a physical 6-4 guard who would provide a strong challenge for Crimson freshman Siyani Chambers.
Since the Crimson’s offense revolves around Chambers as the primary ball handler—the freshman plays nearly 38 minutes a game and has no true backup—the key to defeating the Cowboys would be winning the point guard matchup. To do so, Chambers would have to defeat Smart off the dribble and force the larger guard to chase him around screen after screen in hopes of opening up looks for Harvard’s numerous three-point shooters.
The Cowboys are a guard-heavy team—they rank 96th in the nation with 36.4 rebound per game and their top rebounder averages only a hair about six a game. Additionally, they do not shoot the long ball well as a team, averaging 32 percent from beyond the arc with only junior guard Markel Brown averaging more than 35 percent from deep. Both are good signs for the Crimson, who boast a huge advantage behind the arc with a quartet of shooters in senior Christian Webster, junior Laurent Rivard, sophomore Wesley Saunders, and Chambers. With no true size inside—Harvard’s tallest starter is the 6-8 Kenyatta Smith—the Crimson stands a better chance against the Cowboys than a forward-centered team like Michigan State or Wisconsin.
Although Harvard will need Chambers to hold his own against arguably the best freshman in the nation in Smart, the key matchup the Crimson will need to dominate is Saunders-Brown. Saunders is a rangy 6-6 who can hold his own against any shooting guard in the country, and Brown is no exception. Brown is the Cowboys’ second leading scorer and their only legitimate three point shooter, and Harvard will need its top perimeter defender to shut him down. If Saunders can hold Brown to thirty percent shooting or less, the Crimson can pack the paint and dare the mediocre Cowboys shooters to beat them. If both happen, Harvard stands a fighting chance of shocking the Cowboys in what would have to be a 4-13 first round matchup.

But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 6 Miami Hurricanes from the ACC.
Record: 25-6 (15-3 ACC)
Best Wins: vs. Michigan State, vs. Duke, at North Caorlina State
 
Worst Losses: vs. Indiana State, at Florida Gulf Coast
 
RPI: 4
 
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 14
 
Projected seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 2
Star Players: Shane Larkin (So. Guard) 14.2 ppg, 4.3 apg, Kenny Kadji (Sr. Forward) 13.5 ppg, 7.1 rpg
By all measures, the Miami Hurricanes have exceeded expectations this season. The preseason coaches’ poll had Miami slated to finish fifth in a top-heavy, deep Atlantic Coast Conference.  The squad stumbled out of the gate losing to a Florida Gulf Coast team that had more losses in the Atlantic Sun than the ‘Canes did in the ACC. The unit, whose players have never been to the NCAA tournament, won 23 of their next 25 to surge to number two in the national rankings. On the way, they blew a No. 1 Duke squad out of their gym, while taking out NC State and North Carolina on the road.
After finally losing its first conference matchup, Miami, now projected as a No. 2 seed by ESPN, cooled off a bit. But the squad’s strong start was enough to overcome losses to Wake Forest, Duke, and Georgia Tech in the span of a couple weeks to finish first in the ACC
Miami’s biggest strengths lie in its team defense, which ranks second in the ACC in forcing 14 turnovers per game. Miami held its opponents to under 60 points in 12 of 20 conference matchups.  On the offensive end, Miami only commits only 11 turnovers per game thanks in part to sophomore guard Shane Larkin’s 1.9 assist/turnover ratio.
But Miami’s vulnerabilities have become apparent down the stretch. Against both Georgia Tech and Wake Forest, the Hurricanes couldn’t stop their opponents from scoring timely threes. In both affairs, they made bad situations worse by letting momentum get the better of them.
Given the Canes’ tendency to play down to their opponents, Harvard has a fighting chance if it can control the tempo from the outset and capitalize on looks from the outside. Over the last three years the Crimson has scored nearly 35 percent of its points on 3-pointers. Should the draw pit Harvard against Miami, the Crimson, which will be outmatched by Miami’s inside presence, will need a big contribution in this department. If Harvard is able to keep the game within reach, juniors captain Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster will need to step up and play big roles to put the Crimson over the edge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four unanswered fourth -uarter goals propelled Brown to an 11-9 home win over the Harvard men's lacrosse team Saturday night in the teams' Ivy League opener.
The Crimson (2-3, 0-1 Ivy) led the Bears (4-1, 1-0 Ivy)throughout most of the contest, but an unassisted marker from senior attacker George Sherman pulled Brown ahead with 6:15 left in regulation. Sherman crashed the net before launching a successful close-range shot between the pipes.
Harvard held a 19-5 advantage in face-offs, but key stops from Brown freshman Jack Kelly allowed the Bears to control the possession late. Kelly made five of his game-high 15 stops in the fourth quarter. Freshman attacker Henry Blynn, who led all scorers with two goals and three assists, tacked on an insurance marker with 1:44 left to seal the game for Brown.
"It was a frustrating game," Crimson captain Jason Gonos said. "We played well at times. Sometimes I feel like a broken record because we're close. We definitely have to take one more step and kind of get over the hump, and we haven't done that yet. "
The Bears' final two goals of the game came with the shot clock on.
"[Brown] executed with urgency at the end," Harvard coach Chris Wojcik said. "We were playing great and forced the shot clock, but we didn't complete the play. That was the story of the game."
The Crimson jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the first quarter with goals from junior attackmen Carl Zimmerman and Daniel Eipp and freshman attacker Sean McDonough. Zimmerman (1 goal, 1 assist) drew the Crimson even with Brown after a goal from Tim Jacob provided the Bears' only lead of the game before the fourth quarter. McDonagh's goal came unassisted with 11 seconds left in the frame.
In the second, Brown outscored the Crimson, 4-2, in the first half of the frame to draw even with Harvard. But goals from freshman attacker Devin Dwyer (2 goals, 2 assists) and senior midfielder Alex White (2 goals) in the final four minutes of the period put the Crimson back in front, 7-5. White and freshman Brendan Newman contributed Harvard's first two goals of the period.
"I thought we opened the game really well. Offensively, we really moved the ball and generated some really high-quality scoring chances, and we finished our shots," Wojcik said. "We scored seven goals in the first half but only two in the second; we aren't going to be a good team doing that."
Harvard maintained the two-goal advantage through the third. Brown tied the game again with strikes from Blynn and sophomore attacker Nick Piroli (2 goals), but Harvard responded with two goals in the final 1:05 of the quarter. Dwyer found the net on the man-up and Ryan Stevens (1 goal, 1 assist) scored 19 ticks before the end of the quarter to put the Crimson up, 9-7.
Brown controlled the fourth quarter as Phil Pierce pulled the Bears within one early in the final frame. Minutes later, a cross-check from Harvard captain Jason Gonos put Brown on the man-up. Freshman attacker Kylor Bellistri converted off a centering feed from Blynn to draw even with the Crimson.
The Bears won the next faceoff to set up Sherman's go-ahead goal. Minutes later, Blynn struck on the right wing to give Brown some breathing room with less than two minutes remaining.
"[Brown] took advantage of any bad shots and really created transition," Gonos said. "We couldn't really stop them in transition defensively.... They just took advantage of any of our mistakes."
Two saves from Kelly in the game's final minute allowed Brown to kill off a 30-second pushing penalty. With the come-from-behind win, the Bears avenged a 10-9 overtime loss to Harvard in the teams' 2012 Ivy opener. In that game, Jeff Cohen '12 scored three goals in the fourth quarter and provided the overtime winner to lift the Crimson to its own come-from-behind home win.
With Harvard's leading scorer graduated, Gonos was happy to see three Crimson freshmen break through with goals at Brown on Saturday. Dwyer's four points led all Harvard scorers.
"Devin Dwyer has been scoring and distributing the ball really well this year," Gonos said. "He's doing much more than we could have asked as a freshman on the offensive end."
The Crimson will face Bryant at home on Tuesday and will return to conference play next Saturday at Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of Desmond Bryant ’09’s childhood dreams has finally come true.
After four seasons playing for the Oakland Raiders, the defensive tackle finally cashed in on a solid football career on Wednesday when he signed a five-year, $34 million dollar contract with the Cleveland Browns.
"I've always had a vision, since I was a young boy, that I was going to play in the NFL,” Bryant said at his press conference on Thursday. “But I never knew what kind of numbers would be on the contract. As I got older and got into the league and saw what other people were making, it was a goal of mine to be paid like the elite player that I feel I have developed into.”
The achievement of that goal marked the culmination of a long, often obstacle-laden journey to the NFL for the defensive lineman, who experienced his share of ups and downs both at Harvard and in the pros.
COMING TO CAMBRIDGE
After spending his first three years of high school in Middletown, Del.—where he played basketball and football—Bryant moved with his family to Elizabethtown, N.C. during his junior season. The defensive tackle graduated from East Bladen High School in 2004 following a senior year in which his team went 13-1.
After turning down scholarship offers from Duke, Florida A&M, and Towson, Bryant—with a 4.2 weighted GPA and a 1230 on the SAT—chose to attend Harvard.
“Desmond was a raw skinny kid when we recruited him,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy wrote in an e-mail. “It was a bit of a coup for us.”
“I was about 75 pounds lighter than when I came out of high school,” Bryant explained. “I feel like [switching schools] affected my recruiting as well.”
The lineman’s transition to the college game was initially a challenging one.
“At the beginning of the season, I had no confidence on the field and didn’t know what the plays were,” Bryant said at the time. “I didn’t know where I was supposed to be or what I was supposed to do.”
But the rookie soon figured it out and earned a starting job at defensive end by the middle of his freshman season for a team—led by fellow future pro Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05—that went a perfect 10-0.
But Bryant’s progress was halted when Murphy was forced to suspend the lineman for one season after his freshman year for an undisclosed violation of team rules. Murphy allowed Bryant to play the final two games of the regular season, against Penn and Yale, and then the lineman returned for his junior year, when he appeared in all 10 games.
Following that season, the psychology concentrator was forced to take another year off, this time for academic reasons.
But when he returned to campus, he was a better player than ever.
Playing alongside his brother Brenton, then a junior, Desmond led the team with eight quarterback hurries and 4.5 tackles for loss, helping earn him second-team All-Ivy honors.
“He made steady progress throughout his career,” Murphy wrote.
EVERYTHING IS OAK-AY
Bryant was not selected in the following year’s NFL draft, but was able to earn a free agent contract with the Oakland Raiders.
“Coming out of Harvard, obviously it’s difficult to get into the NFL,” Bryant said. “I felt as if I was given a chance and able to make it to a training camp, that once there, I would handle the rest.”
That was exactly what happened for the lineman, who impressed the Raiders coaching staff the in preseason by recording sacks against the 49ers and Saints.
After making the Raiders’ 53-man roster in 2009, Bryant continued to stand out. He appeared in all 16 games during his rookie season, recording 24 tackles. The following year, he recorded his first sack, and then earned the starting job midway through the 2011 campaign, during which time he registered five sacks and 35 tackles.
“I think one of my strengths as a player is being able to rush the passer and affect the quarterback,” Bryant said. “I am out there giving 100 percent on every play. I love to be on the field as much as possible and trying to make something happen.... I like to think I play whistle-to-whistle, sideline-to-sideline on every play.”
The lineman continued to do just that last season, when he registered four sacks. Playing both inside and outside for the Raiders, he continued to establish himself as one of the league’s best run stuffers.
“His size and his athleticism [show] up on tape,” new Browns coach Rob Chudzinski said. “He’s a relentless guy and is solid against the run with really good pass rushing ability as well.”
BROWNIE POINTS
Coming into the 2013 offseason, Bryant was widely considered the best defensive tackle on the market, and the Browns jumped at the ability to lock him up on the second day of free agency.
“Des is a player that we were very anxious to try to get,” said Cleveland general manager Joe Banner, who noted that while working for the Eagles four years earlier he had tried to sign Bryant as a UDFA. “He fits what we are looking for.... We feel very lucky to get him.”
Bryant chose the Browns’ $15 million guaranteed offer over interest from a number of other teams, saying he was excited about the franchise’s future.
“I am ecstatic to be here working with this new group of guys,” Bryant said. “They really know what it takes to help build a winning team. It’s exciting. I can feel an energy in this building like things are really moving in the right direction.”
Bryant’s much-publicized arrest for alleged public intoxication—in which his mugshot went viral online—did not serve to limit the Browns’ interest.
“We looked at everything that we could,” Banner said. “We evaluated his situation, looked at his history and felt very comfortable that he fit the profile of what we were looking for here.”
“I obviously made a mistake,” Bryant added. “I apologize for everything that happened. I feel like I have learned from it and I have moved on from that. I think I have done enough over the years I have been in the league to exhibit that that’s really not the kind of person that I am.”
Chudzinski agreed, saying that the arrest did not reflect Bryant’s true personality.
“Once you get to know Des a little bit, [it becomes clear that] he has a chip on his shoulder,” the coach said. “What he has done with his career is a testament to his hard work. He is a self-made man in that way. Those are the types of guys that we want to have here, that have that type of attitude, that chip on their shoulder to be a great player and to be the best.”
Murphy believes that for newly-affluent defensive lineman, that best is yet to come.
“[Bryant] has improved steadily since he signed a free agent NFL contract,” Murphy wrote. “The bottom line is that he is just reaching his full potential now and in that sense he’s a late bloomer who has yet to plateau.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team was overrun by No. 4 Northwestern, 16-3, Saturday during the program’s first trip to Lakeside Field.
Despite quickly falling behind to the Wildcats (7-1, 2-0 ALC) in the first half off five unanswered opponent goals, the Crimson (0-4, 0-2 Ivy) returned at the beginning of the second half with two quick goals from captain Micaela Cyr to bring the score to 7-3.
Ultimately, Harvard players faltered against tough Northwestern defensewomen and the Crimson was unable to get on the scoreboard for the rest of the game.
“We played well in defense and made defensive stands and got the ground balls,” Cyr said. “We just couldn’t get it to our offense.”
Freshman attack Audrey Todd led the team with three ground balls. Todd had previously recorded three goals in Harvard’s two last outings.
Northwestern closed strong as standout senior Erin Fitzgerald scored her fourth, fifth and sixth goals of the game in under three minutes to put away the contest.
Harvard was only able to get 11 shots off during the game, compared to the Wildcats’ 38. The three goals surrendered by Northwestern are their lowest since Penn State was also held to three in May 2011.
“[It] was really just the play in the middle of the field,” Cyr added. “We had a lot of difficulty clearing the ball.”
Harvard has now started the season with four losses and has only scored a total of eight goals in its last two games.
Northwestern proved too powerful for the Harvard team, with pressure all over the field being the key factor.
“I think that we did a good job being aggressive all over the field and that was something that we really worked on since our last game,” said Northwestern assistant coach Danielle Spencer. “We did a good job of really having pressure on the Harvard players at all times and I think that was a key for us.”
The Crimson was 2-1 against the Wildcats in previous meetings, emerging victorious in the last confrontation in 2003. Since then though, Northwestern has become the team to beat in women’s lacrosse. Formerly a two-time national champion at Maryland, Kelly Hiller took over as head coach when the sport was made varsity again in 2002. In a very short space of time, Hiller manufactured a championship-winning program.
Since 2005, the Wildcats have appeared in every national championship final, losing only in 2010. That run included two undefeated seasons in 2005 and 2009. Northwestern appears to be competitive again this year, with its only loss coming away at then-No. 5 North Carolina.
Leading the team is All-American Fitzgerald. She had scored five goals on five separate occasions prior to Saturday, but in a dominant performance went one better Saturday, putting six past Crimson goaltender Melanie Cook. After only eight games, she already has twenty-eight goals for the season, only three less than the entire Harvard squad has scored so far.
“[Fitzgerald] has been playing really well as of late and we’re just letting her keep rolling with it,” Lewis said. “She’s been a threat all over the field. She’s been hustling [and] she’s been working very hard in the practice setting and her hard work in the practice setting is showing in the games.”
Looking ahead for Harvard, there are games this week away at Marquette on Tuesday followed by a home fixture against Ancient Eight rival Yale.
It has only been four games and there is still plenty of the season left, but the team has suffered from a lack of offensive production thus far.
“We’ll keep trying, we’ll keep practicing hard,” Cyr said. “We can turn it around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team will face the University of New Mexico Thursday in Salt Lake City in its NCAA tournament opener.
The 14-seeded Crimson learned its fate at a gathering of Harvard fans at the Murr Center’s Hall of History Sunday afternoon.
“Obviously we’re incredibly excited and thrilled to see our school’s name come up on that screen,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said moments after the tournament field was announced. “We’re proud to represent our conference and our institution.”
After a 66-year drought, the Crimson will appear in the NCAA tournament for the second straight season. Harvard will look to improve upon last season’s 79-70 loss to Vanderbilt, but the Crimson (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) will have its hands full with the 29-5 Lobos. New Mexico, which is coming off a victory over UNLV in the Mountain West championship, has won nine of its last 10 matchups and ended the regular reason ranked No. 15 in the AP poll.
Junior point guard Kendall Williams leads the Lobos with 13.5 points and 5.0 assists per game. On the wing, New Mexico receives 12.6 points per game from Tony Snell, who has been hot of late. The 6’7” junior has averaged 19.8 points per game in the Lobos last five contests. In the post, seven-footer Alex Kirk paces New Mexico with 11.9 points and 7.9 rebounds per game.
The Crimson and Lobos have shared just one opponent this season—UConn. New Mexico topped the Huskies, 66-60, on Nov. 19 at the Paradise Jam, an annual tournament played in the Virgin Islands. Less than a month later, UConn defeated the Crimson, 57-49.
“With the shorter week, things will have to kick in very quickly for us,” Amaker said. “Get information, get films, and scouting reports, and see if we can start preparing for what we think we’ll see.”
If the Crimson were to defeat the Lobos, Harvard would face either Arizona (25-7) or Belmont (26-6) in the tournament’s third round on Saturday, also in Salt Lake City.
Others teams competing in Salt Lake City will be No. 1 Gonzaga, No. 8 Pittsburgh, No. 9 Wichita St., and No. 16 Southern University. The games will be played in Energy Solutions Arena, home of the NBA’s Utah Jazz.

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: March 19, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the location in which the University of New Mexico beat the University of Connecticut on Nov. 19. In fact, the Paradise Jam tournament at which the Lobos topped the Huskies took place in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, not in Storrs, Conn. In addition, the caption of the photo accompanying this article incorrectly referred to Harvard's opponent in the NCAA tournament, the University of New Mexico.
