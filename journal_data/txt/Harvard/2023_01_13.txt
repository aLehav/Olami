After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Joe Biden lauded former United States Secretary of Defense Ash Carter as “a force of nature” in a memorial service honoring his death at the Washington National Cathedral on Thursday morning.
Carter was the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School until he died from a heart attack on Oct. 24, 2022, at age 68. He served as Secretary of Defense under President Barack Obama from 2015 to 2017.
Friends, family, fellow dignitaries and co-workers gathered for the memorial service. Biden addressed Carter’s family, saying the suddenness of his death makes grief “inescapable.”
“On behalf of our nation, I just want to say thank you,” Biden said. “Thank you for sharing Ash with us and for your own service to our country.”
Biden also spoke to Carter’s deep care for American troops as Secretary of Defense, discussing his determination to improve safety. He shared his knowledge about Carter’s visits to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to comfort the injured soldiers and their families.
“Ash’s connection to our troops and their families was more than a professional duty,” Biden said. “To him, it was personal.”
Current Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin described Carter’s legacy of pushing the Pentagon to “think outside of its five-sided box.” Under Carter’s leadership, combat positions opened to women, and the ban on the service of transgender individuals was lifted.
“Ash gave back. He gave back with his devotion and drive, and he gave back with his mind and with his soul,” he said. “Ladies and gentlemen, we lost Ash Carter way too soon.”
Along with his role at the Kennedy School leading the Technology and Public Purpose Project, Carter was also an innovation fellow at MIT. Former MIT president L. Rafael Reif praised Carter’s skill in applying his scientific knowledge to government service.
“He was as comfortable discussing topics in theoretical physics as in experimental physics, never mind medieval history,” Reif said. “You might never know just by talking with him that he had another full life in the defense and foreign policy arena.”
Carter graduated with undergraduate degrees in medieval history and physics from Yale in 1976.
During his lifetime, Carter was awarded the U.S. Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest civilian honor in the department, on five different occasions. As Secretary of Defense, he oversaw the beginnings of efforts to defeat ISIS.
Carter’s family members believe his most profound legacy, however, “would be the thousands of students he taught with the hope that they would make the world a better and safer place,” his family said in a statement after his death.
“May we be guided by his foresight, his ferocious mind, fortified by his integrity,” Biden said in his tribute speech. “May we always seek the truth, may we always strive to be of service.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Confused and frustrated Cambridge residents confronted city officials at a tense public meeting Thursday in response to the police shooting of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal.
Attendees loudly spoke over, booed, and questioned Cambridge Peace Commission Executive Director Brian Corr, Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05, Police Commissioner Christine A. Elow, and District Attorney Marian T. Ryan about Cambridge Police practices, the ongoing investigation of Faisal’s death, and the name and paid leave status of the officer who opened fire on Faisal.
Faisal, a Cambridge resident and student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was fatally shot last Wednesday by a CPD officer when the department said they responded to a 911 call. According to a Jan 4. CPD press release, the caller reported that a man had jumped out of a window and was harming himself. After a foot chase, Faisal allegedly moved toward officers wielding a knife, and when a “less-than-lethal sponge round” failed to stop him, the officer shot him.
Faisal’s death has sparked international outcry and protests throughout Cambridge, with some alleging racism and police brutality.
The meeting, held at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School in Cambridge, ran over by more than 40 minutes as residents shared personal stories about confrontations with CPD and activists called for defunding or abolishing the department.
Corr, who facilitated the event on behalf of the city, attempted to bring the packed auditorium to order with little success.
“When you have a community meeting, the community is who runs the meeting,” said Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, an audience member who previously served as Cambridge’s mayor and currently serves as the NAACP Cambridge president.
“The NAACP — we’re watching,” he added.
During the meeting, Ryan explained the lengthy investigative process, but told attendees she couldn’t provide a date for when the investigation is expected to conclude.
Elow reiterated that the officer involved will be on paid leave as the investigation is underway, to the dismay of audience members.
Fatema Ahmad, who is the executive director of the Muslim Justice League, was among several attendees who expressed concerns with the decision to put the officer on paid leave.
“It is unclear to me as an expert reading through the Cambridge Police contract why exactly the officer would be on paid leave instead of being actually suspended,” said Ahmad, who spoke at a Monday protest. “How long will this officer be on paid leave while this investigation happens — because you’re saying it will take a long time.”
Pervin A. Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Association of New England, questioned why the police officer who shot Faisal had not been dismissed by the department.
“When I do something wrong at my work, they’re gonna fire me,” she said.
Several attendees, including Ahmad, expressed concern with CPD’s involvement with the District Attorney’s investigation.
Throughout the meeting, audience members were divided on the subject of body cameras, with some calling for their implementation and others citing privacy concerns. Unlike Boston and Somerville, CPD officers have not adopted the practice, though Elow has previously discussed their possible use.
Chowdhury supported the use of body cameras and called on the department to hasten its investigation so officers “can’t hide” the facts “so we can forget about it.”
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick did not immediately respond to a request for comment on protesters’ criticisms.
Attendees also pressed officials on how the city is supporting Faisal’s family. A GoFundMe following Faisal’s death has raised more than $53,000 from residents and other supporters as of Thursday night.
Huang told the audience that Cambridge is “mourning with you,” which was met with jeers and cries of “bullshit” from some attendees.
“It may seem like the city is run by people who are not like the people in this room, but the city is run by people who are like you in this room,” Huang added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five Harvard graduates, including four Democrats, were among the freshman members of the 118th Congress sworn into office last week.
Sen. John K. Fetterman (D-Penn.), Rep. Becca A. Balint (D-Vt.), Rep. Glenn F. Ivey (D-Md.), Rep. Kevin P. Kiley ’07 (R-Calif.), and Rep. Greg J. Landsman (D-Ohio) are the newly elected alumni, joining 77 other freshman members of Congress who took office in 2023.
Senators were sworn in on Jan. 3 — the first day of the session — though representatives did not formally take office until Kevin O. McCarthy was elected speaker of the House in the early morning of Jan. 7, concluding a lengthy contest that required 15 ballots and four days of voting.
Fetterman helped maintain Democratic control of the Senate as the only candidate to flip a Senate seat in the 2022 midterm elections. In a widely-watched race to succeed Republican Patrick J. Toomey ’84, Fetterman beat Republican candidate Mehmet C. Oz ’82 — better known as Dr. Oz, celebrity host of his eponymous TV show.
Fetterman’s campaign found success in poking fun at Oz for living out of state for decades prior to his campaign, producing viral videos that starred prominent New Jersey residents who mockingly noted his “Jersey roots.”
Fetterman earned a Master's in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School in 1999. His Harvard background was at times held against him by critics who pointed out its inconsistency with the working-class aesthetic he developed through his casual appearance and style of speaking.
Balint, a 1995 graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, went on to teach middle school social studies after receiving her degree. Before becoming the first female and first openly LGBTQ representative to serve Vermont in Congress, she was a member of the Vermont State Senate, where she helped pass Vermont’s first gun safety laws and strengthen reproductive rights legislation in the state.
Ivey graduated from Harvard Law School in 1986 and later taught a trial advocacy workshop there each Wintersession from 2013 to 2021. After two prior unsuccessful runs for office, Ivey was finally elected to the House last November on a platform that emphasized affordable healthcare and housing.
Kiley, the sole Republican among the five newly elected Harvard alumni, graduated from the College with a concentration in Social Studies. While at Harvard, Kiley lived in Winthrop House, served as Chair of the Institute of Politics Fellows Committee, and ran an unsuccessful campaign for IOP president.
Before his successful 2022 run, Kiley was a major proponent of the effort to recall California Governor Gavin C. Newsom in 2021. Kiley was endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump and ran on a fiscal conservative platform.
Landsman, the representative from Ohio, earned a Master's in Theological Studies from the Harvard Divinity School in 2004 and later served on the Cincinnati City Council. As a representative, he seeks to lower the cost of living, raise wages, and repair infrastructure.
In 2020, more than 40 Harvard graduates were newly elected or reelected to the 117th Congress.
