After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Omni-directional.” It was this terse response that Brad Laner, sonic virtuoso and Medicine founder, provided when asked to characterize his band’s sixth studio album, “Home Everywhere.” And the man wasn’t lying: deriving influence from Bossa Nova, industrial droning, and harmony-laden folk, Medicine has crafted an album best described as joyous cacophony, impossible to categorize under a single umbrella term. Though upon first listen, the nine individual tracks seem incongruous, even occasionally unpleasant, Medicine’s avant-garde approach to production and song structure is unapologetically itself. “Home Everywhere” is never predictable and always captivating.
Medicine’s capricious musical tendencies mirror the unconventional trajectory of its career. Formed in 1990, the trio of vocalist Beth Thompson, drummer Jim Goodall, and Laner burst onto the alternative music scene with limited success. Merging two tangentially similar, inherently British genres, shoegaze (heavy distortion over barely audible lyrics) and dream pop (breathy, mellifluous vocals), the band divided a fickle American audience. Despite three well-reviewed albums, Medicine disbanded in 1995. However, the original lineup reunited in 2013, releasing “To the Happy Few,” a strong comeback that meshed together the band’s classic ’90s style with a new, clear willingness to take musical risks. Just over a year later, Medicine is back with “Home Everywhere,” exercising similar tactics to captivate die-hard fans and a younger audience alike.
Similar to its last album, the reincarnated Medicine clearly prioritizes instrumentation over vocals or lyrical depth. Thompson’s voice, employed in delicate, lilting coos, is drenched in reverb effects and buried under blistering guitars riffs and relentless metallic clamor. The lyrics, barely decipherable, are often simple, curt and forgettable: the most contemplative line of “It’s All About You” is the trite “I can see through you / And everything that you do.” However, Laner’s sporadic layering of Thompson’s vocals crafts several truly beautiful melodies, which complement the harsh grating of the production well. But Medicine’s strength is not in its vocal talents; it is in the distinct deluge of pure noise dominating every track that elevates the album in both complexity and merit.
Laner never discriminates when choosing what forms of dissonance to weave within Medicine’s repertoire. Indeed, part of the album’s fun is identifying the commonplace noises the band juxtaposes with their melodies: clock alarms, pencil sharpeners, window wiping squeaks and muddy squelches compete with the vocals and gleefully cluttered instrumentation to foster an engaging listening experience. “Turning,” the album’s lead single, couples a pulsing tambourine with smeared, hazy voices. Bolstered by a roaring army of guitars, it is infinitely listenable. A chorus of droning brass instruments and a steady drumbeat consistently interrupt the swirling, summery high of “Cold Life,” yet the two dueling forces work in tandem to create something infectious. And “The Reclaimed Girls” is inherently Medicine: the clamor of pots and pans and shimmering cymbals contends with Thompson’s melodic croons, the entirety of which Laner saturates with distortion. Like the band itself, the track is odd, a bit overwhelming, yet utterly compelling.
With a penchant for padding its songs with a myriad of bizarre sounds, Medicine inevitably creates a few duds. The sauntering “Don’t Be Slow” begins promisingly but eventually descends into the aural equivalent of a pinball machine challenging a buzz-saw to a brawl and losing miserably. It is rare moments like these, in which Medicine’s undeniably unique aesthetic verges on the unlistenable, that instill doubt into even the most ardent fan. Thankfully, the album’s finale compensates for its occasional shortcomings and proves that Medicine’s inventiveness doesn’t exclusively pertain to sound. The concluding title track, “Home Everywhere,” is a rousing, 11-minute amalgamation of genres, melodic allusions, and trippy lyrics (an endless repetition of “Meet me at the rising sun,” for starters). The psychedelic epic, combining Brazilian beats, gorgeous echoing harmonies, and a barrage of abrasive guitars, morphs from a meandering, mellow groove into a plodding industrial march into pure white noise. The song exemplifies how Medicine (and particularly, production mastermind Laner) remains unafraid to experiment with unconventional music structures that could very well scare away a greener, modern audience.
Over 20 years have elapsed between “Home Everywhere” and the group’s critically-acclaimed debut, “Shot Forth Self Living.” Despite this, Medicine’s singular musical identity—a fusion of airy dream pop and unyielding distortion—cements the seminal band in relevancy. In an age where an increasing number of alternative acts eschew innovative, divisive production for a more accessible pop flavor, the band refreshingly refuses to compromise its signature, occasionally strident, sound. With “Home Everywhere,” Medicine remains a panacea for the uniformity plaguing its genre.

Making the jump to the American film market from abroad is a difficult feat accomplished by only a few great directors, notably Alfred Hitchcock and Guillermo del Toro. In “Revenge of the Green Dragons,” Andrew Lau and fellow director Andrew Loo are trying to replicate the feat. Known best in this country for crime thriller “Infernal Affairs,” basis for the Oscar-winning Scorsese film “The Departed,” Lau’s new enterprise seeks to strike a balance between the fast-paced Hong Kong crime films that are his trademark and the American tradition of the gangster film.
Based on Fredric Dannen’s 1992 New Yorker article of the same name, “Revenge of the Green Dragons” follows the involvement of two immigrant brothers, Sonny (Justin Chon) and Steven (Kevin Wu, better known as YouTube personality KevJumba), in the rise of a crime empire in New York’s Flushing Chinatown. Paul Wong (Harry Shum, Jr.), head of the Green Dragons gang, is falsifying immigration papers for Chinese aliens to grow his influence in Flushing, but his increasingly aggressive and ruthless maneuvering within his organization makes Sonny begin to question his loyalties.
“Revenge” is the most high-profile product of a collaboration between Lau and Loo that goes back more than 15 years. “We met socially back in the late nineties—’96, ’97. I was producing a film in Hong Kong, and my wife was producing his film ‘Storm Riders,’ so we sort of met then and continued to work together on smaller things,” Loo said. “In 2005, we did a film called ‘The Flock’ [Lau’s first English-language film]…. When we were finished, then we said, ‘Hey, this is a fun thing—we have compatible thing going here,’ so we decided to start our own company and focus on English-language co-production type of projects.” “Revenge” is the first movie to come out of this arrangement. The directors’ skills were very complementary. “His background is in producing and writing, but me, I don’t like meetings!” Lau said. “I’m on the set. I handle the technical side of things.”
The subject of “Revenge” was especially appealing to the directors. “Andrew’s done his share of gangster films…. Just doing a gangster film isn’t enough to get the juices flowing,” Loo said. “When we read the original article it was based on, back in ’92, it was just a fascinating investigative report on a real gang. It’s all real events, real characters, all true. For us, we were immediately struck not only by the crime aspect of it, but it also happened at a very significant time in the history of [immigrants’] integration in the United States…. For us, it was really an interesting story, not just about crime, which has its appeal but was really for us a story, an American story, about a part of Asians’ history here, who really haven’t had their story told.”
Faithfulness to the news story was one of the directors’ primary goals. “We made a commitment to the original writer, as well as to ourselves, to be as truthful to what actually happened and to the environment in which the Green Dragons existed [as possible],” said Loo. This faithfulness is what motivated them to shoot in New York in spite of the relatively large expense, rather than seeking a cheaper filming locale like Toronto or Chicago. “For us, this wasn’t just an American story or an Asian story—this was a New York story,” Loo said. In spite of the specificity of the plot, the directors still feel that it is a story with broad appeal. “This was a much more universal story,” Loo said. “Finding a better path to walk—it’s something that’s not specific to race or gender or nationality.”
This layering of significance—and the ambivalence that arises from it—is at the heart of “Revenge,” Lau said. “The American dream—everyone comes here from everywhere, and maybe, at the end, it’s a bad dream.” Hopefully, Lau’s American dream will end well. “Revenge of the Green Dragons” is seeing limited release throughout the United States on Oct. 24.

There is a point in “Ouija” where a character states, “I don’t want to be here; it feels wrong.” Whether Hasbro saw an opportunity to market their board game or Universal needed to fill a quota of horror movies to release this year, one cannot help but feel as though this film should not exist. “Ouija” suffers from a serious ambivalence that is reflective of the entire modern horror genre of today. Looking back to the golden days of the horror genre, films had conviction, motivation, and a sense of purpose. But by borrowing from a host of greater films, “Ouija” fails to be original and only reminds us of how genuinely terrifying horror used to be.
Debbie (Shelley Hennig) is a stereotypical blond high school student who is inquisitive in all the wrong ways. She plays with a Ouija board because she doesn’t know any better and eventually hangs herself due to the influence of some malicious spirit channeled through the board game. Debbie’s four other friends discover her death a day later and wish to say their final goodbyes to her using the Ouija board. What’s the worst that could happen?
It is within this opening sequence when that the film decides to give us a taste of every old trick in the book. Doors open and stoves turn on by themselves. It’s puzzling if this is the limit of what director Stiles White has to offer in his feature directorial debut. Surely the Ouija board has granted the filmmakers the potential to tap into something creative and imaginative, along the lines of the superior Guillermo del Toro-produced “Mama.” Unfortunately, “Ouija” becomes nothing more than a missed opportunity.
All of the film’s tense moments hinge upon the jump scare. The sudden appearance of a figure out of nowhere, or the panning of the camera to a presence lurking behind a character. The film utilizes these without earning them. Take, for instance, a scene in which the characters are exploring a dark house and decide to turn on the light. As the lights switch on, another one of the teenagers is suddenly and laughably revealed in the room. Cue the shock. He had no reason to be there and did not even enter the house with the original group—he was just standing there because he felt like it. The entire film is a series of jump scares that shock but do not terrify. They surprise for a moment but do not evoke the sense of dread that leaves one wanting more. It is the immaculately crafted suspense building up to the scare that is most powerful, not the scare alone. Better horror films such as “Alien,” “The Shining,” and even the recent “The Conjuring” are testaments to this craft. This film’s failure stems from a severe lack of atmosphere, an essential component to any piece of horror. And the uninspired cinematography may be best described as passive. The score that is never used during the film’s tensest moments is deficient of dissonant shrills and discordant sounds that could have enhanced the experience. The result is a film that may surprise, but never spooks, unnerves, or sends chills down one’s spine.
While many horror films only utilize the clichéd Ouija board in a few scenes, an entire movie revolving around the board game fails to connect. Halfway through the movie, the board itself is lost in the proceedings as the main antagonist becomes the typical ghost seeking vengeance on ignorant teenagers who, of course, feel no need to seek help from the authorities. Interestingly enough, they seek the aid of their superstitious Hispanic maid, who is conveniently knowledgeable of everything Ouija. While most horror movies do not require sensible plot or characters, “Ouija” becomes so ludicrous that suspension of disbelief is no longer an option. Moments of coincidence, convenience, and absurdity break the sacred illusion and immersion essential to effective horror.
As White’s first film and a product of Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes production company, the film didn’t have much going for it in the first place. Although the climax finally revealed some horrifying images of the ghost, it’s too little and too late. The most redeeming quality of the film is its brisk 89 minute runtime. “Ouija” is bogged down by unintentionally humorous moments, a lack of atmosphere, poor craftsmanship, and little ambition. The film’s most heinous crime is that, while it borrows from so many greater films, it does not respect them or their themes. “Ouija” never attempts to inspire in its audience a fascination for the actual board game, and, fundamentally, the supernatural. In the world of “Ouija,” spirits are simply tools used for cheap scares and nothing more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charles D. Baker ’79 is a strong, principled centrist at best, with an ever so slight tilt to the right. If he wins in Massachusetts, a state with roughly 11 percent registered Republicans, it will not be because the people of the state had a change in heart and were ready to be led by a Republican—three years of living here have thoroughly convinced me of that. He will be elected because the people of Massachusetts understand that it is far better to have their liberal government work efficiently than to have it haphazardly managed with no clear direction. Charlie Baker is the only candidate running who has the experience and vision to make that happen.
In most other states around the country, voters will largely treat the midterm election as a referendum opposing the ideologies of the President and Congress. But Massachusettsans are faced with a different choice: one between two gubernatorial candidates—Baker and Martha Coakley—who have engaged in a battle to prove their competence. Voters are simply deciding who can run the existing Massachusetts government better. From this angle, the case for Baker is actually quite simple: He has both private and public sector experience, and his leadership and customer-focused initiatives are what saved Harvard Pilgrim Health Care when it was on the brink of closure.
In regards to his platform, Baker emphasizes the need to pull away from partisan ideologies. He has crafted proposals that balance a need to create an environment conducive to growth and prosperity with a strong commitment to equal opportunities for all. For example, Baker’s economic polices focus on incentivizing work and job creation, while also ensuring a continued support for welfare and other financial aid programs. He vows not to raise taxes—that’s the “hardcore” Republican flavor in his policies—but he plans to raise the minimum wage to $10.50 (which is $0.40 above the proposed federal minimum wage), while also giving tax credits to small employers so they can feasibly accommodate the increase in minimum wage. Furthermore, Baker plans to implement tax breaks for employers who hire individuals on welfare.
But let’s suppose that you still do not buy that pro-choice, pro-same-sex-marriage, pro-tighter-gun-control-laws Charlie Baker is ideologically different from other Republican candidates. Let’s even put aside the fact that many prominent liberals across Massachusetts—like Mayor Tom Koch of Quincy—and most all of the major news publications in the state—including the left-leaning Boston Globe—have endorsed Charlie Baker.
Even then, a vote for Charlie Baker is a vote for guaranteed accountability.
As many sources have rightly observed, if Baker were elected, he would face a veto-proof majority in both the state House and Senate. He would have to work with the other side of the aisle to get things done. And more importantly, he would provide a much-needed dissenting voice to check and counter the actions of the Massachusetts government.
There are two major takeaways from this election. First, the people of Massachusetts have fashioned their lives around an extremely progressive democracy. What Baker might lack in textbook Republican ideology, he makes up for with a strong understanding of Republican governance, governance that at its core is about devolution of power and letting states be run the way the people of that state deem fit. This means that Baker will govern in a way that allows Massachusetts to be Massachusetts—by materializing and better managing initiatives brought forth by well-intentioned but overly idealistic Democrats.
Which leads to the second takeaway: Martha Coakley is by no means a bad candidate, especially if you give her the benefit of the doubt that she does not stand by the recent comments made by a certain well-known endorser who claimed, “Corporations do not create jobs.” But to alter slightly a quote made by another famous Clinton, there is nothing wrong with Massachusetts that cannot be fixed with what is right in Massachusetts. And what is right with Massachusetts is that the people from this great state are tough, hard working and innovative. They have proven their resilience by recovering from recessions and other state tragedies time and time again. They do not need an ideologue—from either party—to come in and impose an overly partisan agenda upon them. They do not need major changes that can drastically alter lifestyles. At this time, what Massachusettsans need is someone who understands the strength of the people and the wherewithal to build upon that power a functional and reliable state government.
Massachusetts deserves the best, and that is why it deserves Charlie Baker.

No matter whom you ask, Republican control of both the Senate and House of Representatives after the Nov. 4 midterm elections seem increasingly probable, even inevitable. This reality all but assures that President Obama’s final two years in office will be even less productive than his embattled last four.
Incumbent presidents usually fare extraordinarily poorly in their second-term midterm elections, so the Democrats’ woes are far from surprising. The more interesting question is whether the president’s party will receive a “shellacking” on par with 2010. Fielding a cadre of lackluster candidates, they seem increasingly destined for that fate.
Democrats should look no further than themselves when diagnosing what went wrong in 2014. In large numbers, Democratic Senatorial candidates capitulated to Republican messaging, attempting to distance themselves from the president—on matters of popularity, not principles.
Colorado Senator Mark Udall, who has lost a steady lead in his reelection bid, skipped a visit from the president this summer and has been careful not to be seen with him, despite voting for the president’s agenda 99 percent of the time. In North Carolina and Arkansas, embattled Democratic incumbents have either skipped the president’s visits or sought to publicly challenge him before their constituents.
In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell’s Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes has refused to even say whether she voted for the president by citing the “sanctity of the ballot box,” and runs campaign ads solemnly declaring, “I’m not Barack Obama.” Unlike Grimes, Democratic Alaska Senator Mark Begich is unwilling to even say the president’s name, according to the Los Angeles Times.
By engaging in this brand of defensive posturing, Democrats have ceded the narrative to Republicans while accepting an election devoid of ideas.
If there is one redeeming quality to the elections, it is that the Republican candidates are embracing a more moderate social message. At least eight congressional Republicans have endorsed gay marriage, and two openly gay GOP candidates are currently running, including Richard Tisei in Massachusetts’ sixth district. The American people, and now the federal courts, have caught up with the times—the Republican Party is starting to, as well.
Republicans are also slowly acknowledging the existence, and success, of the Affordable Care Act—in states where the number of uninsured has dropped precipitously, Republicans are finding it harder to campaign on repealing the ACA.
It would be one thing if Democrats truly disagreed with the president’s core policies like minimum wage increases, student loan reform, and continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act—but they don’t. Missing a photo op while privately endorsing all the president’s proposals is just the kind the shallow and superficial politicking that has turned Americans against Democratic leadership. The playbook will have to change in 2016.

High school seems like a long time ago. The days of class for eight straight hours, the flurry of activities that followed afterward, the mornings of waking up at the ungodly hour of 6 a.m.—these are all, mercifully, things of the past.
Harvard, or a place like it, was definitely part of the future I then imagined. In class, dreams of academic recognition and glory were not far behind. My pencil would wander down to the scrap piece of paper that I had torn out of my notebook and begin to draw the same thing I had drawn all my life: Lines that would eventually come together to form a mountain-looking object. And then, in the middle of this bliss, I would be snapped back to the reality of class.
I would be proud of my escapades as I looked around at my classmates. “Look at me,” I thought smugly, “dreaming of places beyond Alamance County, South Carolina. Look at these poor schmucks imagining a life not far beyond the county lines.” I was a visionary, more or less.
And now, when I find myself overwhelmed with Harvard, I am afraid of losing that same vision. It doesn’t matter that I find myself in the place where my dreams used to reside.
Recently, I have once again found myself wandering adrift in the middle of class—like a child staring out the window, dreaming about the possibilities in the undefined out there. I still occasionally hear the sound of a lawnmower, or imagine that I do. Even more, I think many of the same thoughts about my Harvard classmates as I did my high school ones. Nowadays, these thoughts run something along the line of pity for these poor, ignorant pseudo-intellectuals stuck high up on their ivory tower. Harvard didn’t get rid of my high school daydreams–because that desire to be somewhere else still exists, that desire to dream about something bigger and higher.
And yet, there is a part of me that is unwilling to part with that feeling. That perhaps I am meant to dream and desire something higher. I find it difficult to believe that the main reason why I am here is to focus on nurturing and expanding my mind in the narrowest sense of the word. That is why I keep doodling when I should be paying attention to how agent morality fails to fit inside the typical model of moral relativism.
Sometimes, I seem to measure my personal success in how well I can do with paying as little attention to the present as possible. This place is weird like that—it encourages you to dream about the future while making you constantly aware of the importance of doing things now, of not missing out on anything now.
It is not as if it is not feasible to have a one foot on the present and another on the future. It is possible to be a stressed—out college student worried about your next paper while harboring dreams about what life outside of this place holds for you. Perhaps my example is too specific—an indication that my experience speaks more to my own troubles than the problems the rest of my classmates face.
Usually, these pieces are filled with some sort of call to action. To stop doodling and pay attention in class. Or perhaps to continue dreaming and throw all that this institution tells you to do to hell, wrapped in those same scrap pieces of papers. And yet, I can find no answer for this dilemma. To doodle and pretend to pay attention, or simply to pretend?
I know that my drawings have never amounted to anything. While I have seen people beside me create or recreate works of art, my little grassy knolls and weird anteater-shaped humanoids embarrass me upon a second viewing. And yet, they’re just as important a part of my education as anything I learn in class. I don’t view them as a distraction—I view them as my way of trying to process whatever I’m learning and how to relate to the real world.
Oftentimes, as much as I may want to believe it, learning about Aquinas’ argument for the existence of perception does not do me much good. Dreaming about my future career plans as a Very Important Person in a Very Important Place doesn’t do much for me either. The natural result of these two coming together, obviously, is something that looks like it belongs in a bad animated TV show. And maybe the answer lies somewhere in there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 30, 2014, at 10:35 p.m.
Former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who worked closely with Harvard presidents on projects in Allston and the Longwood Medical Area, died on Thursday morning. He was 71.
“At just after 9 a.m. this morning the Honorable Thomas M. Menino passed into eternal rest after a courageous battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his devoted wife Angela, loving family and friends,” longtime Menino spokeswoman Dot Joyce said in a statement, according to The Boston Globe, which first reported the news.
Menino, who left office earlier this year, had been fighting advanced cancer. Last spring, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws at Harvard’s Commencement Exercises.
Menino was Boston’s longest serving mayor. He took office in 1993 and was consistently re-elected by double-digit margins. Even as he announced in 2013 that he would not seek a sixth term in office, he confidently declared that he could win again if he wanted, a pronouncement few disagreed with, as his approval ratings often eclipsed 70 percent.
“No one I've known has personified Boston’s heart and soul, its drive and its resilience, more than Tom Menino. I have been privileged to call him a mentor and a friend,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement on Thursday. “All of us can learn from his powerful and humane example, and his countless friends and admirers across Harvard will greatly miss and long remember him.”
A ‘UNIQUE’ MAYOR
Menino worked alongside four Harvard presidents and countless University employees assigned to massage Harvard’s relationship with the city. On Thursday, many of those Harvard officials remembered Menino as a unique politician.
“He was an absolutely extraordinary person, totally candid, totally unpretentious, always frank in his discussions with anyone,” Neil L. Rudenstine, Harvard’s president from 1991-2001, said in an interview.
Still, under Rudenstine, Harvard’s relationship with Boston, and its leader, had its share of ups and downs. In June 1997, the University disclosed that under a covert program launched under Bok in 1988, it had anonymously acquired over 50 acres of land in Allston and was preparing development plans.
The secret holdings blindsided Menino and touched a nerve. The partnership did not recover until Lawrence H. Summers was named Harvard’s new president in 2001. Summers made a point of visiting Menino soon after he was elected, and the men became close friends and partners. Though they too had their minor disputes, Summers and Menino worked together to craft and approve Harvard’s ambitious plans in Allston.
“Tom Menino was a great friend to Harvard and to me,” Summers said on Thursday. “In his own unique way, he saw how by working together a great university and a great city could be greater still. I’ll always treasure the memory of our times together.”
‘THAT’S WHAT LEADERSHIP SHOULD BE’
After Summers left the Harvard presidency in 2006, Menino said he was left unsure about the direction the new leadership would take.
“When there is a transition of administrations, you never know what the new administrator is going to do,” Menino said last year in an interview with The Crimson. “We didn’t know how it was going to end up.”
When Faust was picked to replace Summers, she quickly paid Menino a visit in Boston. The trip began a tradition for the two leaders, who met from time to time for breakfast either in Boston or at Faust’s official residence in Cambridge.
Just over a year after that first visit in 2007, Faust went to see Menino again with the difficult news that Harvard would suspend its ambitious building projects in Allston.
“I drove out to his house in Hyde Park because he had just had an injury to his knee and couldn’t leave the house, and so he received me there and was deeply concerned but also pretty understanding,” she said in an interview on Thursday. “He asked a lot of us but understood what the limits were.... He was tough on me but also understood.”
It was a far cry from the bitterness of ten years’ prior, when Menino characterized the relationship as “no relationship.” In his second two terms as mayor, Menino began to actively work with Harvard students during visits to campus and through fellowship programs that landed Business School and Kennedy School graduates on his staff.
“Nobody worked harder than Mayor Menino. You couldn’t log enough hours to outwork him. He was terrific to work with and for,” remembered Meredith L. Weenick ’90, who went to work in Boston City Hall as an HBS fellow in 2002 and became a close adviser to Menino. Weenick returned to Harvard as the vice president for campus services this spring.
As Faust and Menino began to work closely together—Harvard has now restarted its development in Allston—the Harvard president said she took certain cues from the veteran Boston politician.
In Menino, Faust said on Thursday, she saw a leader who again and again earned and validated the trust of his people. That trust was on display, Faust remembered, during the bombings at the Boston Marathon in April 2013. When he heard the news, Menino, confined to the hospital with a broken leg, demanded he be released. Two days later, he stood on that very leg during an emotional speech at a memorial service in Boston’s south end.
Faust, who was in attendance that morning, remembered being overtaken by Menino’s strength.
“He was about his city and about his community [that day], and nothing was going to keep him from performing that service for all of us, which was to be our leader, to be the inspiring person who brought us together, who himself showed the strength that was part of Boston Strong,” she said in an interview on Thursday.
“His leadership was so validating at that moment, and that’s a powerful lesson,” Faust added, describing Menino’s work during the aftermath of the bombings. “That’s what leadership should be.”

Wonder Woman crashed through Johnston Gate, escaped the chains of patriarchy, and soared as a feminist icon in the early twentieth century, argued American History professor Jill M. Lepore in a lecture on the superheroine’s history and connection to Harvard on Thursday afternoon.
More than 100 attendees packed the Knafel Center at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to hear Lepore retrace the academic and feminist influences on Wonder Woman and her creator, William Moulton Marston, who graduated from the College in 1915.
Radcliffe historian Susan Ware set the alternately irreverent and sincere tone for the lecture as she introduced Lepore, interspersing her informative comments with humor.
“I’m delighted that Lepore is introducing the wonderful rich histories of suffrage, birth control movements, and modern feminism to general readers, although they may learn more about the history of bondage along the way than they expected,” she said.
Lepore, whose latest book “The Secret History of Wonder Woman” was released earlier this week and formed the basis for the talk, claimed that her titular heroine was originally a pro-women's equality propaganda figure.
“If you want to tell me that Wonder Woman is not a feminist project, we’ll have to take that outside, because the project is very explicitly feminist,” she said. “Its promise is to teach boys and girls that women can do anything.”
Lepore then delved into Marston’s connection with Harvard, explaining that the young psychology student was profoundly influenced by the College’s decision to bar radical suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst from speaking at Sanders Theatre. Decades later, Marston would depict Wonder Woman bursting through the gates of a fictional college, symbolically carrying on Pankhurst’s struggle, according to Lepore.
Lepore also connected Marston’s research in the Psychology Department­—he helped to invent the lie detector—with Wonder Woman’s nemesis Doctor Psycho, arguing that the exploitation of women in the labs inspired the character.
“The central conceit and plot of Wonder Woman involves exclusion of Radcliffe women from classrooms at Harvard, and the use of women as objects of study by Harvard professors,” she said.
Lepore also shared that Marston himself was intimately acquainted with the feminist movement of the early twentieth century: his mistress was the niece of birth control activist Margaret Sanger, and feminist symbols of balls and chains recur throughout his comics.
“Wonder Woman is bound up not because it’s fetishistic S&M, but because it’s an allusion to suffrage,” she said.
Although Marston died in 1947, Lepore argued that his works provide a bridge between seemingly disparate “waves” of feminism.
“When you put Wonder Woman back in the 1940s and you realize that she is inspired by these suffragists and feminists in the 1910s, it’s a source of continuity,” she said. “Gloria Steinem and others of her generation talk about how they were reading Wonder Woman comics, and it’s like the missing link is finally there. The twentieth century makes sense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The President’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault will begin hosting student focus group sessions early next month, according to an email sent Thursday from Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. Four discussion sessions, open to the undergraduate community, will run nightly from Nov. 10-13.
Lassonde wrote in the email that he hopes undergraduate input will allow the task force members to “develop a better understanding of how sexual assault and sexual harassment happens at the College, as well as to spark creative ideas about how to stop it.”
Earlier this month, Steven E. Hyman, the chair of the task force, referenced the student sessions in an announcement detailing a campus “climate survey” scheduled to be distributed the spring.
The announcement Thursday comes only weeks after investigators arrived on campus as part of a Title IX investigation prompted by a complaint filed by at least one undergraduate last year. The Undergraduate Council has also recently criticized the University for a perceived lack of student inclusion in policy discussion.
UC leaders, however, recently applauded the University for pledging to involve undergraduates in an upcoming review committee on the University’s new sexual harassment policy.
While UC President and Vice President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said they were “thrilled” at the formalization of the focus group sessions, they added that they hoped students are similarly included on policy feedback.
“[Harvard administrators] seem to trust students a lot and give them a lot of voice when it comes to asking them about how we can change our own culture, and we hope that they will see students as equally important when it comes to changing policy. These are two important parts of the same equation.” Goffard said.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, expressed hope that the University might commit to providing avenues for “actual, concrete change.” She added that the task force must ensure it will solicit feedback from a “wide variety” of students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two experts in educational inequality exchanged diverging opinions on race-based affirmative action in the college admissions process at a forum at the Graduate School of Education on Thursday.
The forum, titled “The End of Race-Based College Admissions,” featured Sheryll D. Cashin, an alumna of the Law School and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, and Richard J. Rothstein ’63, a visiting scholar at the GSE and a research associate at Economic Policy Institute.
During the discussion, there was disagreement between the two experts on different aspects of the topic. Cashin argued that affirmative action in higher education should be primarily based on social class, whereas Rothstein advocated for a race-based policy that favors African Americans.
Cashin said that colleges’ admissions policies should take into account the socioeconomic background that the student comes from.
“We should de-emphasize standardized test scores… and compare the achievement of the students to the resources that they have available,” she said. “The valedictorian of Ferguson, Missouri deserves a leg-up. The person who has had to overcome these enduring structural disadvantages—I don’t care what color they are—needs and deserves a leg-up in admissions.”
She added that students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are much more likely to give back to society by working in public service after they graduate.
Rothstein said he favors a raced-based admissions process partly because American society has a “moral and constitutional obligation” to remedy a history of discrimination against African Americans.
“I’m concerned with how we as a society remedy centuries of caste based public policy that has relegated African Americans disproportionately to the lowest social classes and the worst neighborhoods,” he said. “Policy makers don’t need less race consciousness; they need more.”
When Cashin pointed out that African Americans are not the only racial group that was discriminated against in American history, Rothstein said that Latinos are integrating into American society better than African Americans in some places. This is evidence that the African American case is a unique one, he said.
Audience members said they appreciated the points made by both experts.
“I think the two speakers articulated their positions very well. They clearly disagreed on a lot of things very strongly but the discussion was very rich,” said Alexander W. Dean, a student at the GSE.
Lindsay M. McKenzie, a student at the Law School, agreed.
“It was a very timely debate,” he said. “Affirmative action is in a difficult situation now; there are a lot of reforms. It’s very spirited. There’s a lot of disagreement, which I liked.”

David Zweig, a social science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, spoke on Thursday about the dangerous “game of chicken” that led to the ongoing Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong and the long-standing socioeconomic inequalities that the month-long pro-democracy protests have highlighted.
The event, which was moderated by retired East Asian professor Ezra F. Vogel, comes about a month after the start of the protests in Hong Kong on Sept. 26 and demonstrations of solidarity on Harvard’s own campus on Oct. 2.
Zweig argued that a “game of chicken” between the Chinese government and the Pan-Democratic camp, in which both sides refused to compromise over their ideals, culminated in the Umbrella Movement protests.
“Nobody wanted to show their full hand,” he said. “The Democrats, the Pan-Democrats, never showed where they would move in terms of negotiations.”
This resistance to compromise between the Chinese government and Hong Kong protesters is, according to Zweig, characteristic of the larger political divide in Hong Kong. A primary disagreement within Hong Kong concerns the minimum threshold of votes necessary for chief executive nomination by Hong Kong’s Election Committee: conservatives argue for a high percentage of votes, whereas the “student position, the radical democratic position, and even the moderate democratic” position calls for universal suffrage with no nominating committee, he said.
The minimum votes threshold was recently set to 50 percent, and Zweig argued that this decision effectively “foreclosed” the Democrats, who can only make up a maximum of 12 percent of the committee in its current form.
This change to 50 percent, he said, was the catalyst for the Occupy Central civil disobedience movement.
“[Chinese government officials in Beijing] knew that they would get Occupy Central if they came out with the 50 percent threshold,” Zweig said. “But they’d rather put up and survive Occupy Central rather than have a chief executive who is not patriotic and doesn’t love China.”
Zweig said that, contrary to arguments by the media and the Pan-Democrats, China has kept its promise under Hong Kong’s Basic Law. “China never promised that there would be no nomination committee,” he said.
Zweig also spoke about the demographics of the movement, characterizing it as student-driven and youth-driven. The movement lacked broad support until the government’s use of tear gas against protesters galvanized opposition, he said.
He wrapped up the event by discussing the socio-economic issues that the Umbrella Movement and Occupy Central have highlighted.
“The conservatives, the tycoons, the business elite can really control the legislature and prevent any kind of social welfare policy,” he said. “Beijing has to realize that they have a social problem—it’s not just a political problem.”
The discussion was part of the Modern Asia Series, sponsored by the Harvard University Asia Center, the Modern Asia Seminar, and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.

Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker and Philosophy professor Susanna Siegel argued that an integration of the humanities and sciences would enrich and bring new insights to both disciplines in a discussion Thursday afternoon.
The conversation, which was organized by the Mind/Brain/Behavior Graduate Student Committee, spanned topics including the relationship between the sciences and the humanities, the role each plays in academic inquiry, and what each can reveal about the human mind.
Both professors advocated for consilience, the unity of principles from different disciplines.
“There is a pressing imperative on modern intellectual life to integrate,” Pinker said. “Integrating the sciences with the humanities is a culmination of a process that has long been unifying supposedly incommensurable metaphysical realms.” As an example, he cited the gradual convergence of theories of the philosophy of the mind and the study of cognitive science.
Pinker said that connecting the sciences and the humanities could help to address “some of the malaise in the humanities,” which has faced declining enrollments and funding levels in recent years. Integration of the disciplines could increase the number of opportunities for discovery and attract more students to the humanities, he said.
In addition, Pinker said that deeper connections between the humanities and the sciences would benefit the sciences as well. “The sciences have an enormous amount to gain from the greater attention to [the subject under study] that humanities brings,” he said, adding that the humanities could enrich “laboratory studies that can often be sterile and misleading.”
Siegel similarly described how the integration of the sciences and humanities could enrich both fields through the use of different investigative methods. She said that humanites allows individuals to understand human experiences through immersive methods, such as “reading textured, detailed descriptions of experience,” reaching a higher level of detail than some analogous scientific descriptions and case studies.
Siegel argued that the humanities can contribute to the body of knowledge by broadening the conception of what's plausible through the use of imagination.
“Science is all about relying on entrenched judgments of possibility,” she said. “In the humanities, we rely heavily on imagination because we’re interested in what’s possible.”
The discussion concluded on conciliatory terms, with Siegel saying that the “aim is for harmony without hierarchy” and Pinker calling for more innovative cross-disciplinary interactions.

BOSTON—Barrie Landry, a board member of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF and donor to the new graduate-level child-protection program at the School of Public Health, was honored at the UNICEF Children’s Champion Award Dinner with the Helenka Pantaleoni Humanitarian Award Thursday night at the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston.
Landry was recognized alongside UNICEF supporter and supermodel Heidi Klum. Other notable attendees included “Project Runway” co-host Tim Gunn and Boston Red Sox player David Ortiz.
Landry’s $1 million Harvard donation initiated a pilot program for the child-protection program that launched this fall through a joint initiative between UNICEF and the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at HSPH. The program is the first master's program in child protection.
It aims to prepare “a cadre of really well-trained child protection professionals,” Landry said.
The program will also educate UNICEF officials each year, said Susan Bissell, chief of child protection at UNICEF.
It is offered as a sub-concentration in HSPH, and students who complete a specified number of credits from the child protection curriculum will graduate from the HSPH master's program with a certificate in Child Protection.
Bissell said HSPH “provided a platform to bring together international academics in child protection."
President and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF Caryl M. Stern noted that the child protection program could be beneficial in responding to crises such as the current Ebola crisis, which has infected and orphaned children.
As for the future of the program, “I am funding the pilot program and hopefully it will draw a lot of attention and become self-sustaining,” Landry said.
Barrie Landry was married to Kevin Landry ’66, also a major supporter of Harvard, before he died in 2013. In 2010, he was awarded the Harvard Medal, the highest honor the University gives to alumni for extraordinary service.

At a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Thursday evening, Allston residents reiterated community concerns with construction management issues that they feel Harvard has not addressed.
The meeting’s primary intention, though, was to give updates on the upcoming demolition of the old Charlesview apartment complex adjacent to the Business School.
Interior demolition at Charlesview will be completed in early November, according to Edward G. LeFlore, a consultant hired by the University for construction management. The property was obtained in a land swap in 2007 and its residents relocated in the summer of 2013. The interior demolition allows for a quick dismantling of the walls and foundation to begin afterwards.
Demolition will continue through the spring of 2015, with the expressed goal of clearing the land by the completion of the Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons, which broke ground in Dec. 2013.
Construction will then begin on the site starting in late 2015 with a new street to be called Academic Way. It will cut through the property and also assist with traffic mitigation for the construction of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in 2016 and 2017, according to Kevin Casey, the University’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications.
Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for Allston set aside much of the site for a six-to-nine-story administrative building, known as a “gateway site.” However, Casey said that interest from faculty has initiated an internal discussion among University administrators as to whether the building should be used for academic purposes instead.
He added that the gateway site’s intended use will be determined by the time of the next task force meeting in late December.
Comments from Allstonians, however, mostly focused on the Barry’s Corner project across the street from the old Charlesview complex.
Harvard leased the 2.67-acre site across the street from the old Charlesview to Samuels & Associates, its real estate partner for the project. Parking for the Charlesview project is all on-site, while Harvard asks that Barry’s Corner workers pay a $15 daily parking fee at a nearby garage. Most neglect to do so, filling the streets with cars, according to community members.
Although Casey and LeFlore confirmed that Harvard was working on a response after receiving a letter on the subject this week, Allstonians were not satisfied, saying that they had brought these concerns before the University early in the planning process.
“To say at this meeting that you are looking at the parking issue, which is deeply important to the community, and that you will plan for the future when you have had over a year to review it is simply disappointing,” task force member Bruce E. Houghton said.
Other task force members also mentioned property damages from construction vibrations from the Barry’s Corner site, as well as community concerns about safety at nearby Library Park, citing a lack of police surveillance that was especially worrisome as Harvard works on an abutting Rena Park, which will open in 2015.
Allstonians were clear in their desire for extra meetings regarding the new developer for the last phase of the new Charlesview project and regarding solutions to the Barry’s Corner issues. Officials from Harvard and the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which hired the task force, agreed to host more meetings.
“Even while Samuels & Associates is operating its own project with its own community outreach,” Casey said in an interview after the meeting, “Harvard is very much a partner and has an interest in the project going well and responding to the community’s concerns.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council elections have kicked off amid some confusion about rules for soliciting petition signatures via Facebook, with two tickets so far receiving penalties for posting photographs in violation of election rules.
As of Thursday night, four potential tickets have been soliciting signatures to run for president and vice president, respectively—Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16  and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17, Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and  Ema H. Horvath ’16, and Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16. All candidates are current representatives on the Council, excluding Horvath and Jackson. Nasrollahzadeh, Goyal, Kanuparthy, and Yang are all on the UC’s executive board.
The pairs must each garner 150 undergraduate petition signatures for their names to be automatically placed on the ballot. So far, the Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal ticket has already surpassed that amount, while Yang and Jackson, as well as Kanuparthy and Horvath, are “incredibly close” to reaching the requisite signatures, according to UC Election Commission chair Matthew C. Estes ’18. Heine and Turban have “yet aways” to reach the quota, but have, like all candidates, until Monday at midnight to do so, Estes said.
The Election Commission, independent of the Undergraduate Council, has so far levelled sanctions against two tickets, Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal and Yang-Jackson, for rules infractions.
Just last week, the Council passed this year’s set of election rules. The rules are, by and large, the same as those of last year’s elections, but starting this year, potential candidates are allowed to solicit petition signatures on Facebook.
The scope of this approval, however, appears to be a point of confusion among candidates.
On Tuesday, the Election Commission asked Goyal and Nasrollahzadeh to remove one post from Facebook that featured a photograph of him and Nasrollahzadeh indicating that they were entering the race, according to Estes. The post bordered on campaigning, which is forbidden during the petitioning period, Estes said.
Goyal, for his part, said that the sanction came as a result of a “misunderstanding” concerning the new rule, and that he quickly complied with the Commission’s request.
“We had no intention to break any rules whatsoever,” Goyal said.
Yang and Jackson were also forced to remove a Facebook post of their own, which featured them clad in capes and superhero-like attire, climbing one of Harvard’s gates.
“Campaigning, in any form, like with photos like that, is explicitly forbidden before campaign period,” Estes said about both tickets’ posts. Estes added that the Commission “practically immediate[ly]” asked the candidates to take down the posts.
Yang and Jackson are currently serving a three-day ban on soliciting petition signatures because, Estes said, he made clear in a correspondence to them beforehand that they were not allowed to publish a post of that sort on Facebook. Estes added that he does not believe their campaign will suffer greatly from the sanction because they are just about a couple dozen signatures shy of the 150 mark.
Yang, who said she was unavailable to speak on the phone, wrote in an emailed statement that the Commission had clarified some confusion about the rule and whether posts with pictures were permitted. She added that her campaign has not been negatively affected.
Goyal said that he and Nasrollahzadeh had reported the Yang and Jackson post to the Election Commission after seeing it shared on Facebook, but that the the Commission had already been aware of the post in question. Estes confirmed this account in an email Thursday night.
Yang wrote she was not aware that another ticket had reported her campaign, but was “glad to hear that all the candidates are keeping everything in check, making sure this is a fair election.”
Estes said he expects all four tickets to garner the requisite signatures by the deadline Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From Ufa, Russia, to Potsdam, N.Y., the scene is the same.
A smooth-skating forward accelerates up his opponent’s wing, waiting for a teammate’s quick feed. Once he gets it, he knows what to do with it.
The result, whether it’s a far-side wrist shot for Team USA or an overtime one-timer for the Harvard men’s hockey team, speaks for itself: Jimmy Vesey was born to score.
IN HIS BLOOD
Vesey enters the 2014-2015 season as the Crimson’s great goal-scoring hope. The 6’2” junior has led the team in goals in both of his first two collegiate seasons, displaying an uncanny ability to generate offense off the rush and get pucks on net.
“One-on-one with a defender, he’s impossible to stop almost,” said Harvard junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo, who will join Vesey on the team’s first line this year.
Vesey’s speed, skill, and long reach have produced memorable moments and high honors in recent years.
As a freshman, Vesey earned Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors and won a gold medal for the United States at the IIHF U20 World Championships in Russia, bolstering the team’s front line and netting a goal in the semifinal to upset Canada.
Last season, he adjusted to an enhanced role in Harvard’s offensive scheme and netted an overtime winner at Clarkson to secure the Crimson’s first three-game winning streak in over two years.
This year, he carries the expectations of a preseason first-team All-ECAC selection­—the only such honor for the Crimson.
On Saturday, Vesey will scan the stands of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center as he joins his teammates on the blue line for the first national anthem of his team’s season. He will be looking for about 10 to 20 friendly faces—cousins, aunts, and uncles—led by his father, Jim Sr., and his mother, Amy.
“They’ve sat in the same section [behind the Harvard bench] for the last two years at every home game,” Vesey says. “I always look up there during the starting lineups, national anthem and just kind of take a peek at who’s there.”
The Veseys will likely choose a different section this season, as the Crimson’s newly-renovated home facility has the team’s bench on the opposite side of the rink. Either way, the clan’s presence will remind the junior of the legacy and city he represents each night on the ice.
The name “Vesey” holds important sway in Boston hockey circles. Vesey Sr., a native of Charlestown, was a star center for Merrimack College in the 1980s and still holds the school’s all-time scoring record. After a seven-year professional career that included 15 games in the NHL, he retired in 1995 to focus on raising his two young sons, Jimmy and Nolan, with his high school sweetheart.
The two boys took after their father, who coached them from the time they could skate until the day they started high school.
Nolan, the younger of the two, starred as a top scorer for Austin Prep in Reading, Mass. and just began his first college season at Maine. Last June, the Toronto Maple Leafs selected him in the sixth round of the NHL Entry Draft.
Jimmy, meanwhile, earned a third-round selection from the Nashville Predators in 2012. After three years at the Belmont Hill School, Jimmy bolstered his pre-draft credentials by breaking the Eastern Junior Hockey League’s season points record with the Foxboro-based South Shore Kings in 2011-2012.
Vesey Sr. speaks proudly of his sons in a rich Bostonian accent. He considers their scoring abilities a gift, or at least something genetic.
“They were born to score,” Vesey Sr. said. “People always say, ‘You can teach skating, [but] you can’t teach height, [or] you can’t teach goal-scoring either.’ You can work on your shot, but from my experience, you’re born with it.”
Vesey Jr. speaks with a softer accent than his parents, who first met many years ago in a Charlestown elementary school. Born in Charlestown himself, Vesey lived the first seven years of his life in Boston’s oldest neighborhood before his family moved to North Reading, Mass.
Despite the distance, the town remained a central part of his upbringing. Vesey spent much of his pre-collegiate summers honing his hockey skills against cousins and friends at The Kitchen, a large roller hockey court just off Charlestown’s main street. He takes pride in his Boston identity as something he tries to honor, both on and off the ice.
“My parents are blue collar people, and Charlestown is a blue collar town,” Vesey said. “So I think it’s kind of in my blood…just the fact that I was raised in an environment where my parents tried to instill…a blue collar work ethic into me, and that’s something I’m trying to implement into hockey, school, and stuff like that.”
UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Vesey’s lunch pail mentality has forced coaches, teammates, and trainers to take notice in recent months.
This summer, Vesey dedicated himself to improving the finer points of his defensive game in the hopes of becoming a more complete prospect.
Vesey trained with a group of 15 teammates at Harvard’s Palmer Dixon Strength and Conditioning Center and spent a week at the Predators’ prospect Development Camp.
Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91, a former Boston prep school and Harvard hockey standout himself, has observed an extra pep in Vesey’s step in the team’s first practices this season.
“As a coach, when you have guys that are special players, guys with some special talents, it’s really nice to watch them improve,” said Donato, who was a part of the Crimson’s only national championship-winning team as a sophomore forward in 1989. “They can do some things every day on the ice in practice where you shake your head and smile.”
Donato says that Vesey’s development reminds him of a young Alex Killorn ’12, a second line forward for the Tampa Bay Lightning and Harvard’s latest alum to break into the NHL.
The most dramatic improvement for Vesey this year has been his strength and conditioning. He committed himself to a more balanced diet last summer to trim body fat and add muscle.
Last fall, Vesey clocked in at 16 percent body fat. By last month, he had lowered that number to 11.5 while maintaining roughly the same weight.
“My eating habits the last few years were pretty bad,” Vesey said. “I am kind of a picky eater.”
Vesey has cut out soft drinks from his meals and pays attention to the proportion of starches and proteins on his plate. His commitment to the plan reflects the business-like approach that his family and friends say he takes to his game.
“He’s a guy who’s always competing,” Criscuolo said. “He’s not going to take a drill off.”
Every time he steps on the ice in a Harvard sweater, Vesey puts pressure on himself to produce. Last season represented a learning process for the then-sophomore, who became the opposition’s main target on a young team that suffered from injuries down the stretch.
His season shots on goal total skyrocketed from 79 to 145, but he edged his freshman goal mark by only two, 11 to 13, thanks to a difficult final seven games that held him scoreless. The Crimson finished second to last in the ECAC and was swept by Yale in the conference tournament’s first round.
This season, Vesey says he will try to relax more and let his “natural instincts take over.” His new linemates Criscuolo and sophomore center Alexander Kerfoot should help in this area. The pair propelled Vesey to a three-goal, one-assist performance in a preseason scrimmage in Montreal earlier this month.
Despite his conscious effort to manage expectations, Vesey is unafraid to speak of his season goals in concrete terms.
He wants to become the first Harvard player since Killorn to break the 20-goal barrier, and he wants to win the Crimson’s first Beanpot in over 20 years.
“He told me [that] Harvard hasn’t won a Beanpot since the year he was born, ’93,” Vesey Sr. said. “So that’s a kid thinking there, looking at stuff. He wants to put that jersey back on and get the respect back at Harvard that Donato and those guys who played before him had.”
As he begins his upperclassman campaign, Vesey looks to close on unfinished business.
“I came to Harvard because I believed that by coming here, we could be a team that competed for a national championship, and Beanpot, and ECAC titles,” Vesey said. “I wouldn’t want to leave here without achieving at least one of those goals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a crushing 6-0 defeat to Northeastern in the first round of the Beanpot on Feb. 3, the silence in the Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s locker room suggested one thing: change was now necessary.
Having dropped five of its last six contests, the Crimson had things go from bad to worse, leaving the team in desperate need of a spark. With his squad sitting 10th in the ECAC at 6-12-3 overall, Harvard coach Ted Donato '91 looked to the end of his bench in search of a solution.
For much of the season, then-senior Raphael Girard had maintained a stranglehold on the starting netminding job, posting an impressive .924 save percentage on the year. But after a poor showing at Madison Square Garden against Yale on Jan. 11, the senior began to fall out of favor. Following the team’s latest loss at TD Garden, Donato elected to make a switch to then-sophomore Steve Michalek.
For Michalek, this was nothing new. The 6’2” goaltender from Glastonbury, Conn., had been down this road once before—just not this side of the street.
As a freshman, Michalek impressed right out of the gate, beating out Girard for the starting job and holding it for over three months. The rookie started 20 of the team’s first 23 games in 2011-2012, compiling a 6-6-8 record over that span.
However, after surrendering three first-period goals to Quinnipiac that February, Michalek discovered that his job status was hardly secure. The rookie was pulled in favor of Girard, who rose to the occasion in relief, stopping all 26 shots that came his way and making a strong case for playing time in the process.
“It felt great,” Girard said after the game. “I always have to be ready to jump in the game, and I just used my opportunity and played well.”
Liking what he saw from the Quebecois sophomore, Donato gave Girard the start in nine of the team’s final 12 games, including all five of its postseason contests. The Crimson went 5-2-2 in those matchups, making it to the ECAC championship game, which Michalek watched from the bench.
Fast forward two years to 2014, and the script had been flipped.
Four days following the Beanpot debacle, Michalek reclaimed his position between the pipes for a home tilt against Dartmouth and never looked back. The revitalized sophomore made 21 saves that night, the first shutout of his collegiate career.
With 56 saves over the course of the following week, Michalek seized the starting job for good. The goaltender aided the Crimson to a win over Boston University in the Beanpot consolation game and then another on the road against No. 14/15 Clarkson.
Led by this new presence in net, Harvard had its first three-game winning streak since 2011, when Michalek was watching Girard orchestrate the team’s improbable playoff run from the bench.
But now, it was Michalek in the spotlight—something that the fifth-best goalkeeping prospect in North America according to Central Scouting envisioned when he declined offers from several schools, including Yale, to play for the Crimson back in 2010.
The netminder was well prepared for this kind of attention, having arrived in campus with plenty of experience already under his belt. In 2010, Michalek suited up for the United States U-18 team in Slovakia, starting three of the team’s five contests at the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. He also received the nod in the gold medal game against Canada, in which he saved 23 of 24 shots in a 1-0 defeat.
The following summer, shortly after graduating from the Loomis Chaffe School, Michalek reached the pinnacle of his pre-collegiate career. In the sixth round of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, the Minnesota Wild selected Michalek with the 161st overall pick.
Playing in the NHL had always been a dream for Michalek, so there was no shortage of excitement from the goaltender after the draft. But following Michalek’s first couple years of college, that excitement had begun to evolve into uncertainty.
After Girard took over netminding duties in 2012, Michalek’s role shrunk significantly. Furthermore, the Connecticut native took a leave of absence the following year, instead playing for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders of the USHL.
Thus, when Michalek returned to campus for his sophomore year, no one knew what the future held. But once given the chance, Michalek quickly provided an answer, posting a 1.66 GAA over his final seven regular season starts to get the Crimson, as well as himself, back on track.
“I try to take it as motivation,” Michalek said about his draft selection. “I obviously want to play at the next level, but if you start getting caught up in thinking about the future too much, it’s just unnecessary pressure.”
Aiming to reach that next level, Michalek will look to make this season his best one yet. For the first time in his time at Harvard, Michalek will no longer have Girard by his side. The junior’s competition will include classmate Peter Traber and freshman Merrick Madsen, who have just four collegiate starts between them.
“Ever since [Michalek has] played here, he’s played a lot of minutes,” junior defenseman Patrick McNally said. “It’s not like losing Girard means we’re going to throw a kid in there who doesn’t have a lot of experience. He’s a great goalie, and we know he’s going to be a big part of our team this year.”
With the other goalies’ lack of experience, Michalek surely will have a firm grip on the starting job. But given what the goaltender has been through in the past, Michalek is not jumping to any conclusions.
“It’s no one’s job, especially with the college season the way it is,” Michalek said. “Whoever’s winning is going to play, so it’s my job to keep winning.”
Predicted to finish ninth out of 12 in the ECAC Preseason Coaches’ Poll, Harvard will need Michalek to do just that in order to become a legitimate threat within the conference. In the goaltender’s opinion, that will not be a problem. He feels that the Steve Michalek who appeared down the stretch a year ago should be the one standing in net all season long in 2014-2015.
“I think everyone always has something to prove,” Michalek said. “We have a lot of high expectations for ourselves. We’re going into our season expecting to contend for the league title, and that’s all we’re really concerned about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two returning Olympians­—junior Michelle Picard and senior Lyndsey Fry—won’t be the only members of the Harvard women’s ice hockey team with weighty international hardware this year.
Despite having yet to start the official season, freshman forward Karly Heffernan already can claim two gold medals as a star of Team Canada’s U18 World Championship team. Heffernan, who scored the overtime goal that gave Canada top billing in 2013, is just one of a formidable cadre of first-years making up one of the Crimson’s strongest recruiting classes in recent memory.
Anchored by the lauded Alberta native, this year’s freshman class has six members (five forwards and one defender), all of whom will jostle for ice time on an already-stacked roster of Olympians and ECAC heavyweights. In a group of skaters that has so much talent and proven success, it remains to be seen exactly how newcomers with such potential will integrate into some of the most potent lines in collegiate women’s ice hockey.
“I have cautious optimism,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I think freshmen just need to play hard. They shouldn’t have tons of expectations on them. They’re learning the ropes and what it’s like to be a Harvard student.”
After just one fixture at the Bright-Landry Center, Stone’s optimism is well justified. During a preseason 3-0 victory over McGill, Heffernan, whose two shots and two-for-three face-off record may not light up stat books, was a presence all over the ice, with plentiful possession time and a speed that will prove crucial as the Crimson continues to stump defenses with rapid breakaway plays.
“[Heffernan is] good; that’s why we wanted to get her here,” Stone said after the win. “She’s going to be terrific. I think she showed a lot of what she’s capable of doing tonight, and we’re looking for her to finish a bit more as we go, but a great effort from her.”
Heffernan wasn’t alone. Four of the other five rookies suited up and hit the home ice during the win over the Martlets on Oct. 17. That quartet—composed of forwards Nikki Friesen, Dani Krzyszczyk, Lexie Laing, and Haley Mullins—combined for 10 shots.
Laing, the younger sister of sophomore backup goalie Brianna Laing, chipped in an assist on the third and final goal of the night and battled nobly for possessions, with a team high 10-for-13 face-offs. Laing and Mullins are two of the now eight members of the squad who hail from local hockey powerhouse Noble and Greenough, a school that won four straight league titles during the pair’s tenure.
Whatever may not have occurred against McGill has certainly been seen before through the pre-collegiate experience the incoming players bring to the table. Krzyszczyk and defender Chelsea Ziadie have both earned spots in Canada’s top junior programs. Krzyszczyk is a three-time member of Team Manitoba and a member of Team Canada’s U18 summer team in 2013 while Ziadie has starred for Team Quebec and played on U18 championship teams in 2011 and 2013.
“I think being exposed to the international level of play and that standard definitely has helped transition [us] to Harvard hockey,” Ziadie said. “But at the same time the girls here are all older and stronger and more developed, so that was a stepping stone and this is a higher level technically for us as freshmen.”
With so many questions left—especially whether the Crimson can finally deliver on the ECAC and national crowns that have evaded the team for the past few seasons despite overall success—the role of the rookies is certainly one more. Contending with silver medalists Picard and Fry, and among numerous All-ECAC honorees, how will the freshmen fit in? For Stone, the winningest coach in the history of Division I women’s hockey who is entering her 20th season in Cambridge, it may be less about the numbers in a box score and more about sheer determination.
“We just want them to play as hard as they can and do their best,” Stone said. “It’s not about whether they score goals or keep pucks out of the net; it’s really about their effort and their commitment level right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A journey of more than 5,000 miles and a plane ride of over 15 hours separates Cambridge, Mass., from Sochi, Russia. That was the trip that Harvard women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone, along with senior forward Lyndsey Fry and junior defenseman Michelle Picard, embarked upon in February 2014 to compete for the United States at the Winter Olympics.
But even though all three took the trip from the same city, the road to Sochi has varied for each team member.
Stone, Harvard’s veteran coach starting her 20th season with the Crimson, had coached the U.S. national team to one silver and two gold medals in the past three years of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) championships.
A Connecticut native, Stone grew up on the New England hockey scene and became the winningest coach in the history of Division I women’s ice hockey in 2010.
Stone was chosen as the coach of Team USA in June 2012, making her the first-ever female coach of a U.S. Olympic hockey team in the sport’s history.
But the call to serve her country from the bench came with a price—the end of her streak of 19 consecutive years coaching from behind the boards in Cambridge.
The coaching duties for the 2013-2014 season were passed on to then-assistant coach Maura Crowell, who had been the Crimson’s second in command for the previous three seasons. With Stone away, Crowell stepped in as interim head coach and led Harvard to a 23-7-4 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament.
“I think it’s really important to be yourself when you are a head coach, even if it is an interim role,” said Crowell, now associate head coach. “That being said, a lot of the knowledge I gained as an assistant for three years with Katey obviously went into play with what we were teaching the kids. I tried to keep a lot of the staples of Harvard hockey in the system.”
Picard, a native of Tauton, Mass., had played for the U.S. U-18 team on her way to becoming an Olympian.
Fry, who participated in the same national program, had taken a more unconventional route up the junior ranks from her warm-weather hometown. The Chandler, Ariz., native has been playing hockey since a young age and attributes her success to her community and family.
“For me personally, [the Olympic experience] had so much to do with my family and everyone who supported me back home,” Fry said. “I’m from Arizona, which is not exactly the hockey capital of the world, but the great thing is that the hockey community there is so small and tight-knit. So when I first stepped onto the ice in Sochi for practice, just seeing those Olympic rings, all I could think of was all the people who had ever supported me.”
Over the course of last season, Stone, Fry, and Picard were never away from the team for long, holding Olympic training right outside of the Boston area in Bedford, Mass.
Fry even lived in Cambridge during the year off, enabling her to stay connected with Harvard hockey while training with Team USA.
Stone, too, kept tabs on her team from afar, often coming to practices and games to support her players and coaching staff.
“I love my job at Harvard and love the program that we built here,” Stone said. “I always had an eye on what they were doing and kept in contact with the coaching staff while staying focused on the task at hand, which was coaching the Olympic team.”
After going 3-2 in the Sochi Olympics and bringing a silver medal back to the United States, Stone, Fry and Picard are back at home in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for the 2014-2015 season. Both Fry and Picard posted ice time in all five of Team USA’s contests, although neither of the duo managed to tally any points for the Olympic squad.
The transition back to the Crimson has been seamless for both players and coach, as they return to familiar surroundings with a renewed appetite for success.
“Coming back is awesome,” Fry said. “I absolutely love it…. I missed these kids so much. It’s just so fun, and we have a blast every day. During those months that we were training [for the Olympics], four people still had to get cut. That was really stressful, so it’s nice to be able to play, have fun, and work hard.”
The returners certainly have some catching up to do with the team both on and off the ice. After a year away from Harvard, they join a team that includes two classes of players whom they must become acquainted with.
Since the 2012-2013 season—the last time Fry and Picard took the ice for Harvard—14 players have joined the roster. This includes six freshmen and eight sophomores who have yet to play a game under Stone’s coaching style.
“There are two classes of kids that need to get to know me and I [need to] get to know them, versus just one freshman class,” Stone said. “With the sophomores there’s an adjustment period, and we’re sensing it now. So I’m going to try and spend a fair amount of time with them so they can get to know what my expectations are.”
Under Crowell last year, the Crimson notched the team’s second-highest winning percentage in the last five seasons, while finishing second in the ECAC regular season behind Clarkson, the eventual national champion.
A 2-1 loss to Wisconsin in the first round of the NCAA tournament proved that Harvard could compete with some of the top hockey programs in the country.
This year, the hopes of maintaining that competitive edge have prospered, as the Olympians return to Cambridge with a renewed energy and excitement that comes with being back around a team they love and know well.
That said, the overall mindset of the team has not changed drastically since last year.
“I think every year we try to instill some key work ethics into our program,” Crowell said. “Number one is working hard. We have a bigger roster this year and a lot of depth. With that comes a lot of new faces and making sure that they’re brought along and taught how to be fast, be aggressive, and be a really good puck possession team. I think we’re heading in that direction.”
A silver medal is not the only thing that the Olympians have brought back from Sochi.
Competing for Team USA gave the trio a chance to bring invaluable of the sport knowledge back to Harvard, and they are eager to share those tips with fellow teammates and coaches.
For Stone, the time with Team USA allowed her to become acquainted with a new and different mode of training.
“[When you coach an Olympic team], you’re really coaching for a 10-day tournament in February as opposed to coaching for the team to play every week,” Stone said. “It’s a different mindset and a different preparation model, but I enjoyed it. It gave me an opportunity to focus on coaching and learn more about the sport.”
This season’s squad will continue to strive toward and improve upon the success of last year’s team.Looking to pick up right where it left off two seasons ago, Harvard women’s hockey now occupies center stage for all members of the team.
“Our goals are definitely to win as many games as we can,” Picard said. “At the end of the day, we want to win a national championship. We just have to take it one day at a time and makes sure we are playing Harvard hockey every day and getting better every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s ice hockey team takes the ice this season, the Crimson will feature several new and returning faces.
With a diminished roster in 2013-2014 following injuries and Olympic team berths and its head coach out for the season while at the helm of Team USA, Harvard defied odds and expectations throughout last year’s campaign.
The Crimson ended the campaign with a 23-7-4 record, just one win shy of its previous season’s total, while contending for an ECAC championship and playing in the NCAA tournament.
With the return of veteran players from Sochi, a highly touted freshman class, and Harvard coach Katey Stone back at the Bright-Landry Center, the No. 3/4 Crimson has all the pieces in place to achieve its ultimate goal of clinching the NCAA crown this year.
The absence of some key playmakers from the Crimson’s depleted squad last season left room for growth in the young but talented group.
“Our team had a fantastic season last year and great leadership by [interim coach] Maura [Crowell] and her staff,” Stone said. “A lot of kids stepped up and filled gaps that were needed. They really pulled the train, and other kids fell into place.”
Four of Harvard’s top five scorers last season were underclassmen. Then-sophomore Miye D’Oench led Harvard with 21 goals and 18 assists, a far cry from the 13 points she tallied in her first season with the Crimson. Classmate Mary Parker added 13 goals and 12 assists, while Hillary Crowe notched 30 points for Harvard in her junior season.
The more prominent roles and increased ice time for these players ensured that this season’s squad has a core of experienced veterans. Harvard also welcomes the return of co-captains junior Michelle Picard and senior Lyndsey Fry, who spent last year training and competing under Stone’s leadership for Team USA.
Harvard also welcomes a heralded recruiting class, further bolstering its lineup. The fresh faces are a welcome addition to a squad that carried only 18 players last campaign.
“[Last year], we had a really tight group which was great, but it was really limiting in other [respects],” D’Oench said. “Even at practice, what drills we can do and what games we can play in a regular practice is night-and-day from this year to last year.”
The biggest question will be if Stone can juggle the bevy of talent the Crimson possesses on the ice.“We’ve done a lot of different things already with the lines,” D’Oench said. “It just shows all the options we have and the firepower that we can utilize in games.”
It seems as if Harvard is primed for success in this season’s campaign, but Stone is quick to avoid the Crimson looking too far down its schedule.
“The landscape is really challenging,” Stone said. “I think if we work really hard, we outwork people, stay committed to each other, you never know. But women’s college hockey is really competitive.”
Harvard will open its 2014-2015 season with a pair of home contests before heading on a five-game road stint.
The Crimson will likely face its toughest test of its early schedule when it takes on No. 2 Boston College over Thanksgiving weekend. Harvard hosts one other top-10 matchup before the holiday break, a Dec. 6 game against No. 5 Quinnipiac.
A short winter break will serve as a quick respite before the Crimson takes on the bulk of its regular season schedule. Harvard will look to clinch its eighth ECAC championship and third-straight Ivy League title.
But despite the horde of talent and experience across the bench, the Crimson still has a long way to go in its quest for the program’s first-ever NCAA title.
“I would like us to put ourselves in a position to win a national championship,” Stone said. “That’s what we’re going to try and do every day. But along the way, we’re going to hit some potholes, and we’re going to see how resilient we are when we do.”
For now, Harvard will have to see how the pieces fit together in its first regular season outing against Rensselaer on Oct. 31.
“It’s a long offseason,” D’Oench said. “We work really hard on and off the ice throughout the year, so this is the time when we finally get to show it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March 8 marked the last time that the Harvard men’s ice hockey team took the ice during its 2013-2014 campaign.
Up one goal against Yale with less than 11 minutes left in an elimination game in the ECAC playoffs, the squad conceded two quick goals, and the Bulldogs proceeded to knock the Crimson out of the tournament. It is a memory that the entire team would like to put behind it. Harvard probably also wouldn’t mind forgetting about its 16 other losses from last season, which included a first-round Beanpot blowout and a grab bag of frustratingly close contests in conference play.
Harvard’s young skaters entered last season on a wave of expectations, yet inexperience and injuries came to bear in a 10-17-4 campaign that placed the team in the lowest quadrant of the ECAC for the second straight year.
This month, under new leadership, the team will set out to prove that it is worth another look.
“Last season was a little disappointing,” junior defenseman Patrick McNally said. “We definitely all thought we could have had a better year than we did…but everyone had a bad taste in their mouth[s]. ”
Over the offseason, the Crimson picked up veteran Holy Cross coach Paul Pearl, who will join coach Ted Donato ’91 on the bench as associate head coach. Pearl led the Crusaders to multiple NCAA tournament appearances in 19 seasons with the team and will provide the perspective of a former college defenseman for the Harvard squad.
“Paul brings a wealth of experience,” said Donato after the announcement of Pearl’s hire in May. “He’s done a great job off and on the ice of developing guys, and I think he’ll be a great addition to our staff. He’ll give us some heft in all the areas.”
The Crimson also made a surprising decision in April when it named rising juniors Kyle Criscuolo and Max Everson co-captains. The pair will serve as the team’s first co-captains since 2011 and first non-senior captains since 1946.
“They’re two great leaders, and everyone on the team looks up to them,” Donato said. “It’s good that we have one forward and one defenseman so that we have guys who can lead in both positions.”
Critical to the Crimson’s attempt to climb ranks in the standings is the continued growth of star junior forward Jimmy Vesey. The Nashville Predators prospect led the team with 13 goals last season and is Harvard’s only preseason all-ECAC selection for 2014-2015.
“His all-around game is ready to take a big step,” Donato said. “Not only in the goal-scoring department, but [in] becoming a complete player. He’s committed to being a guy we use in all situations.”
Last year’s rookies also stepped up and made an immediate impact. Five of the eight point leaders from last season were playing their first years of collegiate hockey, including center Sean Malone, who contributed a team-high 14 assists en route to Co-Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors. Forwards Tyler Moy, Luke Esposito, and Alexander Kerfoot also put up double-digit points in their first seasons. All three should help Harvard address the void left by last year’s senior class.
Graduated goaltender Raphael Girard ’14 ranked third in the conference in save percentage, but then-sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek proved himself equally capable last year, posting a percentage just 0.3 behind Girard in his 18 games.
On the blueline, the Crimson said goodbye to captain Dan Ford but say hello to four freshman recruits. Everson and McNally return as the team’s top pair and will look to improve on the defense’s conference-low four goals from last season.
Harvard’s eight freshmen should provide considerable contributions on all areas of the ice this season. Six-foot-seven defenseman Wiley Sherman and 6’5” goaltender Merrick Madsen lead the 2018 recruiting class as the only draft picks. Forwards Seb Lloyd, Joey Caffrey, and Eddie Ellis will also likely see significant ice time.
“All the freshmen that are coming in can play some minutes,” McNally said. “They’re all good players who [had] proven themselves before they came here.”
The rookies and the veterans will nevertheless have to prove themselves again this season. Despite the return of last year’s core and the influx of new talent, the team enters the year ranked lower in the ECAC preseason coaches and media polls than in 2013 after last season’s disappointing results.
Yet, as the Crimson upperclassmen well know, expectations are a funny thing.The Crimson thinks it has the pieces in place to prove the pundits wrong. The coming months will be a matter of execution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Grave news greeted the Harvard men’s ice hockey team 10 minutes before the scheduled start of its last meeting with Dartmouth.
The Zamboni was dead.
The Bright-Landry Hockey Center’s sole ice resurfacer had stalled on the rink, and the Feb. 7 game hung in the balance.
Only the valiant efforts of an emergency Zamboni repairman and a timely assist from several strong Crimson skaters, who pushed the vehicle off the ice, prevented indefinite postponement. The first puck dropped 109 minutes behind schedule, and Harvard skated to a 3-0 win—the first of a three-game winning streak.
“I don’t know if that will ever happen in my career again,” said junior forward Jimmy Vesey, one of the Zamboni pushers. “It’s something that I’ll always remember.”
The pregame activities before Saturday’s Crimson-Big Green contest also promise to be memorable, but hopefully for more predictable reasons.
Harvard will open its 115th season with a dedication of its newly renovated rink. The ceremony will lead into a compelling matchup of evenly-matched rivals.
The two teams matched each other punch-for-punch last year, splitting their season series and tying for 10th in their conference.
When the ECAC announced its tournament pairings, however, Dartmouth had the upper hand with an extra win, earning the tiebreaker and the right to play Rensselaer in the first round. The Big Green took advantage, upsetting the Engineers in three games, while Yale swept the 11th-seeded Crimson in New Haven.
On Saturday, Harvard and Dartmouth will carry similar strengths into their first games of the season. Both teams will return all of their multi-goal scorers from last year and start reliable junior goaltenders.
“Dartmouth is a worthy opponent,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “It’s going to be a tough game and obviously they’re going to want the first win of the year as well.
Criscuolo, Vesey, and sophomore center Alex Kerfoot will see their first ECAC action together on the Crimson’s top line since Nov. 8, when an injury to Kerfoot forced Harvard to reshuffle forward combinations. The fast-skating trio will line up against an equally quick collection of Dartmouth forwards, who will be led by a pair of seniors—reigning Ivy League goal scoring champ Eric Neiley and Vesey’s former Belmont Hill School teammate Brandon McNally.
“They’ve got some good offensive players who can make some things happen, so we’ll have to watch out for those guys, some of their guys on their top lines,” Criscuolo said. “But overall I think we will match up well against a lot of teams this year if we can use our speed.”
On the blueline, 6’7” freshman and Boston Bruins draft pick Wiley Sherman will have an immediate impact alongside Patrick McNally and co-captain Max Everson, Harvard’s top junior defensive pair. Behind the Harvard bench, newly hired associate head coach Paul Pearl will be evaluating the early work of his new pupils on defense.
“He’s giving a lot of help to the [defensemen] in practice,” senior forward Tommy O’Regan said of Pearl. “He breaks up the drills a lot and calls the D over. I think he’s a real huge help defensively, and I think he brings a really good attitude to practice.”
The game will also feature a netminding duel between junior Steve Michalek and Big Green junior Charles Grant. Michalek led all non-senior Ivy League goaltenders in save percentage last season while Grant received a Second Team All-Ivy nod.
In the Zamboni game, Michalek stopped 21 shots to earn his first collegiate shutout.
For the Crimson, the last month has been like an extended Zamboni delay. The icemen say that they have felt season-ready since the start of school, yet Ivy League rules have forced them to wait to start their campaign this weekend—more than 20 days after most other college teams began theirs.
O’Regan and his teammates are anxious to get things started.
“It’s been a long month of watching other teams play.” O’Regan said. “So there’s a lot of built up passion and momentum and all that kind of stuff. I think everyone is looking forward to getting the first game under their belt.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask a week ago, and any member of the Harvard football team would have said Princeton represented its biggest game of the year. Seven days and 49 points later, that answer no longer remains valid.
After the Crimson (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) cruised to a blowout win against the Tigers last Saturday, the most formidable obstacle in the team’s pursuit of an Ivy League title becomes Dartmouth (5-1, 3-0).
Both teams enter the weekend undefeated in conference play. With the Ancient Eight season rounding the halfway point, the Saturday afternoon battle in Hanover is not only for first place, but also for firm control of the conference driver’s seat.
“[Dartmouth] is a very good football team,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “It’s a football team that’s a championship caliber team, and we’re going to have to play our best game of the year by far to win. They just don’t have any weaknesses.”
While Dartmouth no doubt is a balanced team—its offense and defense both rank in the top half of the conference—the most intriguing matchup of the day will occur when the Big Green has the ball. The Dartmouth offense has demonstrated its explosiveness throughout the year, but the Harvard defense has shown it can hold any opponent in check.
Led by a fierce defensive line and captain Norman Hayes in the secondary, the Crimson defense has allowed a league-best 10.5 points per game. Even more impressive is the fact that the starting unit has surrendered just two touchdowns in the last five games.
But Harvard will be pushed to its limits come Saturday. Led by the dynamic Dalyn Williams at quarterback, the Dartmouth offense is staffed by veteran players who know how to move the chains.
In an early October matchup at Yale, the Big Green found itself trailing by 14 points midway through the second quarter. Dartmouth climbed back into the game and captured a 38-31 victory with a late two-yard Williams run.
The junior quarterback, who threw three touchdowns in the victory, is as much of a threat with his arm as he is with his legs. Williams has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to turn a seemingly hopeless play into a gain by scrambling away from oncoming tacklers.
“He came into the league as a great athlete, and he’s now become a great quarterback,” Murphy said. “He’s now got that confidence and swag that not only allows him to be one of the best players in the league, but it also makes everybody around him better.”
Williams, however, is not the only veteran quarterback who will draw on his athleticism to make plays on Saturday. Senior Conner Hempel demonstrated that ability in sparkling fashion against Princeton, throwing for a career-high 382 yards and three touchdowns, along with rushing for an additional two.
The game was Hempel’s first since a back injury he incurred in the season opener, and it also featured the return of senior tight end Tyler Hamblin. Finally at full strength and fueled by a first-rate offensive line, the Crimson offense hopes to build on its record-setting performance in New Jersey.
“I think we always have the capability to [play that well],” Hempel said. “If we do it once, we can do it again. But executing like we did last week is difficult. It all starts with preparation, both in practice and in the film room.”
In 2013, a last-minute field goal was the difference in a 24-21 Crimson win over Dartmouth. If Harvard has what it takes to contain the rapid-fire Big Green offense and earn a road victory, it will find itself alone at the top of the Ivy League standings with just three games to go.
“As an older guy, as a leader on the team, you have to teach the young guys how this sprint works until Thanksgiving,” junior linebacker Jacob Lindsey said. “It’s big on your seniors and juniors who have played to continue that motivation and drive in practice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I apologize in advance for going a little off-script here. This space is normally reserved for getting you up to speed on the state of Ivy League football outside the Harvard bubble. But doing that just doesn’t make sense this week.
To explain why, here is a quick quiz. Below are the records for each of the four Saturday matchups. Which do you think is the most interesting?
A) 6-0 vs. 5-1
B) 5-1 vs. 0-6
C) 3-3 vs 0-6
D) 3-3 vs 1-5
English concentrators, I’ll wait. Ok, got an answer? Yes, 6-0, 3-0 Ivy Harvard’s trip to 5-1, 3-0 Ivy Dartmouth this weekend is the only meaningful contest on paper, so that’s the game I will talk about first. Predictions for the other games will come after (Plus, this is the first time in the history of ever that Hanover was the center of anything, so it deserves recognition.).
Concerning the meaningfulness of this week’s game, the Big Green Athletic Department agrees.
“Dartmouth football hosts #18 Harvard on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in the biggest game at Memorial Field in 17 years,” the school’s athletics website reported this week.
For Harvard, this is the biggest game since last Saturday. That says a lot about the recent history of these two programs.
Wondering why Dartmouth was so specific about the “17 years?” Well that’s when Harvard coach Tim Murphy killed Big Green football. In 1997, Dartmouth was coming off an undefeated 10-0 season and had beaten the Crimson in five of the seven previous matchups. But Harvard routed the Big Green that day, 24-0, en route to Murphy’s first conference title. Since then, the Crimson has won a share of six more championships and beaten Dartmouth in 15 of 16 contests. The Big Green meanwhile went from 8-2 in ‘97 to 2-8 each of the next three seasons. It has not registered a seven-win season since.
Given all of that, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens has been watching Terminator for some tips on a project he’s been working on in his garage.
But maybe he’ll be able to finally let it go this weekend. The Big Green is back. It is 5-1 after handing Yale its only loss three weeks ago and skating by Columbia last Saturday.
Some of the most exciting players in the league wear green again.
Dual-threat quarterback Dalyn Williams has a big arm and a big propensity for breaking big plays. At 6’0”, 210 lbs., he’s also flat-out big.
Then there is explosive wideout Ryan McManus and linebacker Will McNamara, who is averaging two more tackles per game than anyone else in the league.
Murphy said it’s the most athletic, talented team he has seen in Hanover in a long, long time. And it will be the biggest test for Harvard before The Game—only matchups with 1-5 Penn and 0-6 Columbia stand in between.
So will the Crimson get to Week 10 with a chance of going undefeated for the first time in 10 years? I think so.
Dartmouth’s record and star players are eye-catching, but there are concerns too. The Big Green only beat Holy Cross by three at home and Columbia by 20 (that sounds like a lot, but it is the closest game the Lions have played this year). Harvard has posted better offensive and defensive numbers in terms of yards, and with quarterback Conner Hempel back healthy behind a still-dominant offensive line, expect that gap to grow wider Saturday.
Dartmouth has relied on a bend-but-don’t-break defense. Saturday, the Crimson will break them, and Teevens will head back to Terminator for more clues about how to go back in time to wipe out the last 15 years.
Prediction: Harvard 41, Dartmouth 27
Now for those other games…
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
After last week’s 49-7 loss to Harvard, Princeton (3-3, 2-1 Ivy) would probably fall to No. 4 in the Ivy Power Rankings, but it is far from out of contention with games against Yale and Dartmouth remaining. Look for the Tigers to lick their wounds this week and lick Cornell (0-6, 0-3 Ivy) in the process.
Prediction: Princeton 45, Cornell 6
YALE AT COLUMBIA
The battle of the Blues will probably end with the Lions (0-6, 0-3 Ivy) singing the Blues, again. The much more competitive contest will take place on The Daily Spectator’s website afterwards, where the comment section is always a treat. Here are a couple from last week after a 27-7 loss to Dartmouth:
Anonymous: “Horace Mann could beat this Mangurian coached team. Please wake up alumni and demand change immediately!” (I assume he is referencing the K-12 independent school, but I’m also not sure Columbia could score on the 19th-century education reformer. Despite graduating from Brown in 1819, I bet Mann still has a couple years of eligibility left.)
They weren’t all negative though.
Rich Forzani ’66: “Whatever the reason, I was finally able to see passes caught, interceptions made, and runs stopped. It looked like a football game and I hope it continues.”
Some even complimented the opponents too.
Anonymous: “Classy of Dartmouth not to run up the score”
There is also a 610-word rant that I considered pasting instead of writing anything this week, but i’ll let you enjoy it in context. I suppose it makes sense that the fans have gotten so good at commenting after so much losing. They’ll get another week of practice this week.
Prediction: Yale 55, Columbia 10
BROWN AT PENNSYLVANIA
Somehow, this battle is the second best of the week. The Bears (3-3, 1-2 Ivy) have given up 20 points in regulation just once (22 to Harvard), and they shutout Penn (1-5, 1-2 Ivy) last year, 27-0. Another performance like that one would cement Brown as the fifth-best team in the league. That’s as much intrigue as I can provide here.
Prediction: Brown 21, Penn 13

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team has yet to play a single minute of regular season hoops this year, and yet the anticipation to see what the Crimson can do is as high as it has ever been.
Despite losing three key rotation players to graduation last year, the team learned on Friday that it had earned a spot in the Associated Press Top 25, one of what coach Tommy Amaker called the “two main polls” in collegiate hoops. The Crimson tied with Utah for the 25th spot, while recent NCAA Tournament opponents New Mexico and Cincinnati failed to make the list at all. The Bearcats received just eight points compared to Harvard’s 98.
Earlier this month, Amaker’s team also tallied 47 points in the USA Today Coaches Poll, falling just nine short of tying Iowa for No. 25. After a few wins under its belt in the early weeks of the season, Harvard should be able to crack into the rankings, especially given the difficulty of the Hawkeyes schedule. Iowa is slated to play No. 10 Texas and No. 6 North Carolina in the first month of play.
Amaker, however, was careful to stress that his team is more interested in maintaining its “internal standards”—guidelines that each player on the squad must hold himself to in order for the group to succeed—than paying attention to “external expectations,” set by polls and the media, that he believes are extraneous to Harvard’s aspirations.
“We don’t deal with [the expectations],” said Amaker on Thursday, shortly before the AP Poll was released. “[We focus] on our internal standards and our identity and our goals. That’s what has made us who we are, and there has been no interest or feeling whatsoever about anything from the outside that says we’re good, we’re bad…it doesn’t matter. We’re living up to our standards internally, and that’s been an incredible way for us to go about running our program.”
Amaker added that, inevitably, it’d be “really neat” to see his mid-major squad break into the top 25.
“But we’ll see,” he said. “It’s a long horse race, a long season, and…we’re just hopeful that we’ll stay focused on what’s right in front of us, day by day, getting better.”
Friday’s selection marks the first time in over two years that the squad has nabbed a ranking in either the AP or Coaches Poll. The last time it was ranked, the Crimson had yet to win a single NCAA Tournament game in program history and junior co-captain and floor general Siyani Chambers was still in high school.

It's the start of Halloweekend, and unfortunately being at school usually means missing out on the quintessential haunted house experience. Of course, there are haunted locations in and around Boston, but in case you’ve already indulged in too much candy corn to leave your dorm, it doesn't mean you have to miss out! Honestly, your room is probably already the stuff of nightmares. Here are some of the pretty scary things that are all around you every day!
Your Dirty DishesThe swarm of fruit flies you’ll attract will make the night air look especially foggy, and the moldy food sticking to your plates is the real American Horror Story.
Your LaundryAs if the dishes weren’t enough of a mess, the weeks of clothes you keep telling yourself you’ll get around to washing tomorrow are piled high enough to create a maze of ungodly stains and smells in your room.
The Lamonster RoommateShe’s finally returned from her third consecutive all-nighter. You’d best steer clear unless you want to face the wrath of an exhausted, unshowered maniac on the way to turn in that pset seconds before it’s due.
The Freshman 15This manifests itself in the empty beer cans and greasy Insomnia boxes littering the floor of your room. Just try to fit back into the clothes that were already tight when you moved in.

It’s Halloween season, and things are about to get real spooky! You’ve earned a reward for all the papers and midterms you’ve crushed, and All Hallows’ Eve is your chance to claim it. Flyby cares about you, so we’re going to help get you in the Halloween mood with some spirits and songs.
For All My Werewolves:
The Full Moon1.5 oz moonshine1 oz sour mix1/2 oz simple syrup1 oz hair of the doglemon slice garnish
Werewolves, those timeless beasts with an abundance of raw sex appeal, deserve their seat atop the monster-hotness hierarchy. Embrace your inner lupine self, and invoke primal lunar energy with moonshine. Make it bearable (and less throat-scorching) with sour mix, and finally add some simple syrup because you’re probably pretty sweet.
Juicebox Jam: “Wolf Like Me” by TV On The Radio
This underappreciated hit remains the premier example of the werewolf lifestyle. It covers the practical (“when the moon is round and full / gotta bust that box gotta gut that fish”) as well as the mysterious (“when the moon is round and full / gonna teach you tricks that'll blow your mongrel mind”). The song is a very sensual experience, and a drink or two (or five) will only make it better.
For All My Vampires:
Friday, Bloody Friday2 oz vodka1 oz cranberry juice1/2 oz simple syrup2 bat wings1/10 oz garlic
This one stings like vodka, tastes like berries, and looks like blood. The ol’ trifecta. And the best way to build up your immunity to garlic is 1/10 oz at a time. Drink up, and help make vampires cool again.
Juicebox Jam: “Dracula’s Wedding” by Outkast Feat. Kelis
Leave it to Outkast to make a romantic and groovy vampire-themed track to guide your bloodsucking ways. Listen to Andre 3000 when he says, “I wait my whole life to bite the right one / Then you come along and that freaks me out.” Spend this Halloween with the ones you love, and then bite them (in the fun way).
For All My People Who Dress Up In Professional Uniforms:
The Nine-to-Fiver2 oz scotch whiskey3/4 oz vermouthyears of thankless workcherry garnish
You want to be a cop for Halloween? Go for it! You want to be a doctor, or a sexy doctor? Sure! How about a cowboy or a cowgirl? Power to you. Your costume is a working person’s costume, so treat yourself like one. Demand the strong stuff, and take a load off.
Juicebox Jam: “San Francisco (You’ve Got Me)” by The Village People
No group better embodies the dress-up tradition of Halloween than the Village People. They didn’t let their careers as musicians limit their costumes, and neither should you. Bikers, construction workers, karate masters—they’re all Village People. So, “Dress the way you please and put your mind at ease.” Except for the Native-American costume that they used to do. Don’t do that.

Happy Halloween! Hopefully you have exciting plans for the weekend! Here are some questions you might ask yourself before going out:
1) How many pregames am I going to tonight?: Do I want to show up to the party classily sober, decently tipsy, or so shamelessly crunk that I don’t really remember what my costume is even supposed to be anymore?
2) Is my costume waterprooft?: Am I going to start melting at a sweaty and crowded party or have pit stains in all of my pictures? What about when five million drinks are inevitably spilled on me (mostly by myself, but still)?
3) What kind of pictures do I want to take tonight?: Am I going to nag that friend with a DSR to take professional-looking pictures of me for a classic Halloween Facebook prof pic/cover photo change or am I going to take a bunch of grainy muploads?
4) Is Halloween actually going to be fun this year or underwhelming as always?: This question is so real. We guess only time will tell.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREIt’s going to be a high of 53 degrees today and 46 degrees at night for your Halloween festivities! There’s going to be a 20 to 30 percent chance of rain though, so you may or may not want to make your umbrella a “prop” for your costume!
IN THE D-HALLSLunch:Fried Calamari RI StyleHam & Swiss PaniniVegetable Lo Mein with Tofu
Dinner:Chicken Mole PoblanoPulled Pork with ChipotleTortilla Veggie Pie
ON FLYBYWhat Should John Harvard Be For Halloween?: Forget your own costume, this is the one that’s going to be in the photos of ten million tourists by the end of the day tomorrow.
IN THE NEWS1) Menino, Longtime Boston Mayor, Left His Mark on Harvard: Former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who worked closely with Harvard presidents on projects in Allston and the Longwood Medical Area, died on Thursday morning. He was 71.
2) Lepore Unmasks Wonder Woman’s Feminist Origins: Wonder Woman crashed through Johnston Gate, escaped the chains of patriarchy, and soared as a feminist icon in the early twentieth century, argued American History professor Jill M. Lepore in a lecture on the superheroine’s history and connection to Harvard on Thursday afternoon.
3) Profs Argue for Integration of Sciences, Humanities: Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker and Philosophy professor Susanna Siegel argued that an integration of the humanities and sciences would enrich and bring new insights to both disciplines in a discussion Thursday afternoon.
4) Sexual Assault Task Force To Host Student Focus Group Sessions: The President’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault will begin hosting student focus group sessions early next month, according to an email sent Thursday from Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde.

Way back when we believed Carly Rae Jepsen had a promising musical career, it seemed that just maybe our very own baseball team did, too. You might remember that Harvard’s men’s baseball team performed a dance to Jepsen’s hit Call Me Maybe in their van on their way to a game.
The video garnered nearly 18 million hits and led to our boys appearing on various morning talk shows. Alas, both Jepsen and the baseball bros fell from stardom as quickly as they rose, leaving behind only the annoyingly catchy tune, which you’ll now only ever hear at sweaty dorm room parties.
But that’s not where the throwback ends, and in the spirit of Halloween, we want to throw back to October 31 2012, six months after the viral video, when Nicole Bulcher, a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, tweeted a photo of herself and fellow cheerleaders dressed up as none other than our baseball team for Halloween. True, the idea was not really topical because everyone knows that anything that’s viral has a strict lifespan of a month tops (just ask Robin Thicke), but we still appreciate the recognition. It’s probably the only time a Cowboys cheerleader will ever be in a Harvard Baseball players pants.
