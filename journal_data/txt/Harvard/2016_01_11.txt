After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team put in a promising performance against a nationally-ranked team on Friday, but came up just short to pick up its second loss in as many games. The Crimson (0-2) took on No. 7 University of Hawaii (2-0) at the Outrigger Resorts Invitational in Honolulu, Hawaii and fell in straight sets, 3-0, but each set was hotly contested with continuously shifting momentum.
“I thought we played very well, especially with a large crowd and a great team on the other side,” said sophomore middle blocker Riley Moore. “We fought very hard, and showed a lot of character fighting until the end of the match.”
Despite the fact that the team lost in straight sets, it was a night marked by strong individual performances. Three Harvard players garnered 10 or more kills. Junior outside hitter Casey White contributed 11 kills, while senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman and captain Branden Clemens each tallied 10 of their own. Junior libero Samuel Murphy also chipped in 10 digs on the night to keep Harvard in the game.
“[Murphy] played an amazing game,” Moore said. “He had a lot of good plays and he impressed our team with a strong performance out of the back row.”
However, some commanding attacking play from the Rainbow Warriors, including a breakout performance from freshman opposite Stijn van Tilburg, propelled Hawaii past the Crimson. Tilburg racked up a game-high 18 kills, while senior outside hitter Sinisa Zarkovic added 12. The duo contributed to a potent Rainbow Warriors attack that bested Harvard in hitting percentage, kills, and service aces and ultimately proved too much for the Crimson to handle.
Harvard was also undone by a string of attacking errors that allowed Hawaii to build up momentum. In every frame, the Rainbow Warriors were able to pull away on a run of unanswered points fueled by mistakes in the Crimson offense. Seven of Harvard’s 11 errors on the night came in the final six points of sets, while Hawaii committed only three of its 13 in the same frame.
“As a team we need to focus on limiting our errors and stopping the opponent from winning several points in a row,” Moore said. “If we can do that we will have a lot of success this year.”
Despite the errors plaguing the team, Harvard kept the game close throughout the night, with the Rainbow Warriors never leading by more than five points.
The Crimson established its willingness to fight in the first frame, as the teams traded the lead back and forth in a set that saw 14 ties and three changes in advantage. Harvard eventually pulled away for a 21-20 lead, but Hawaii stole the advantage back with a 5-1 run to finish ahead, 25-22.
The second set saw more of the same, as the Crimson leaped out to a two-point lead, only to end up down by five points, its biggest deficit of the night. Harvard clawed back to reduce the margin to three, but the Rainbow Warriors held firm to take the frame by four points.
The Crimson regained some of its footing in the final stanza, holding Hawaii’s advantage to one or two points for the majority of the set.
“A major focus was to keep our offense firing at all cylinders throughout the match,” Clemens said. “I think our offense clicked more consistently throughout the entire match last night [than it did against Lewis].”
However, on the back of seven kills from Tilburg, the Rainbow Warriors’ attack kept one step ahead of Harvard, as the Crimson never led in the final frame. Hawaii was able to once more pull away from Harvard in the final few points to seal the set and the game.
Despite the outcome, the result against a top-10-ranked opponent is a promising one for Harvard as the team heads into the regular season.
“I think we are continuing to prove that we can play against some of the top teams in the country,” Clemens said. “We've seen that we can play tit for tat with these teams, and even take the lead against them, we just need to learn to stay consistent and execute in tight situations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It came down to the last bout of the afternoon. After three dual meets and dozens of matches, the Harvard wrestling team gathered around to watch the deciding match, one that would alter the team’s mood depending on the result.
Junior Nick Gajdzik, wrestling in the heavyweight class, defeated Duke’s Brendon Walsh, 3-2. This victory gave the Crimson (2-1) a 23-17 victory over the Blue Devils (1-4) at Saturday’s Pitt Duals, earning Harvard a winning record on the day after it defeated Bloomsburg (1-11) and fell to No. 4 North Carolina State (16-0).
“We wrestled well against a quality Duke team,” coach Jay Weiss said. “We were down a couple guys in the lineup, so that was good. I really pleased by how they fought today after a very difficult week in practice. It proved that it worked, and they did a nice job today.”
HARVARD 23, DUKE 17
Harvard’s win over Duke featured a number of close matches; captain and No. 7 Todd Preston, senior Michael Mocco, and sophomore Josef Johnson all joined Gajdzik in winning by decision, all matches decided by two points or less. For Preston, it was his third victory on the day.
“Obviously, [Todd’s] our cog,” Weiss said. “He gives you everything he’s got every time he goes out there. He’s the one who drives this team. I’m very happy with how he did; he got into some close matches and came out on top.”
Junior Jeffrey Ott won by technical fall in 133, outmatching opponent Brandon Leynaud, 20-4. Harvard then won by forfeit in 125, occupied by freshman Nolan Hellickson. It is a weight class that the Crimson has struggled to fill in past years, but this time the six points gained ended up being the difference in the meet.
After jumping out to a 14-0 lead through three matches, the Crimson saw its advantage cut to 14-13 after sophomore Kanon Dean came up short in the 165s. Victories in three out of the final four matches, however, saw Harvard retake the initiative.
“I think we had a pretty good day,” captain Patrick Hogan said. “It was really exciting beating Duke, as it came down to the last match. The team was really happy about that…. We’ve been putting in a lot of work, and it’s nice to see that coming into the dual meet season, we’re getting some victories.”
HARVARD 40, BLOOMSBURG 3
The opening meet of the day was a blowout in the Crimson’s favor, as it won nine out of ten matches against the Huskies.
Hellickson pinned Jon Haas in the first match after losing to the Bloomsburg wrestler earlier this season in an individual tournament. It took the Des Moines native six minutes and 47 seconds to earn all six points for his team.
“Nolan keeps getting better every single today,” Weiss said. “[Beating Haas] is a huge turnaround in such a short period of time, from losing to pinning a guy. It shows you the adjustment he’s making in the room. Being a freshman is difficult, but he’s taking huge strides.”
Ott, Mocco, and Gajdzik all recorded their first of two wins on the day against Bloomsburg, while Hellickson, Hogan, sophomores Tyler Tarsi and Josef Johnson, and senior Josh Popple also earned victories for Harvard.
“We started strong, real strong, against Bloomsburg,” Weiss said. “Not so much the score, we kind of beat them up, but more so how we did it: we were really working on things that we’ve been working on in practice, and they were following through, executing it. I was really pleased with that.”
NORTH CAROLINA STATE 37, HARVARD 6
The Crimson endured a difficult meet against the Wolfpack in the middle of the day, winning just two matches—both by a single point.
Hogan was one of eight Harvard wrestlers who came up short against N.C. State, losing by major decision to Sam Melikian.
“I work best when I’m attacking my shots,” Hogan said. “[Against NC State], I think I was a bit too passive, whereas I was a lot more aggressive in the first match. It’s something to work on going forward.”
That may have been true across the entire roster, with the Crimson struggling to get on the front foot against a higher-ranked opponent.
“I thought our guys gave [NC State] a little too much respect,” Weiss said. “We were in matches that we could have won, but obviously they’re a strong team.”
Preston and sophomore Logan Kirby were Harvard’s lone victors in the meet. Preston was expecting to face Kevin Jack, the No. 3 wrestler in his weight class, but the latter could not compete.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After winning its Ivy League opener, the Harvard men’s basketball team (7-8, 1-0) looks to get back to .500 in the final contest of its five-game homestand against Ryerson (7:00 EST). Beat writer David Freed has three things to watch for in the Crimson’s penultimate non-conference game of the year.
CHANGE OF THE GUARD
Through the team’s first eight games, it appeared that freshman Tommy McCarthy had sown up the leading point guard spot for Harvard. After junior Matt Fraschilla went down with an ACL tear in the team’s second game, McCarthy and junior Corbin Miller were the only true point guards left on the roster. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker responded by giving his freshmen a longer rope, giving him at least 25 minutes or more in all but two of the first 10 games through long stretches of turnover-ridden play.
Recently, however, Amaker has begun to tighten the rotation. Since a six-turnover, zero-assist effort against Auburn, the freshman has struggled to get on the floor. Either because of foul trouble (Oklahoma, Wofford) or injury (Vermont), the freshman has not hit the 25-minute mark since the Auburn game. Backup Corbin Miller, by contrast, a steadier presence on the floor, has played at least 24 minutes in each of the last six games after hitting that mark just three times in the first nine contests. Against Ryerson, it will be interesting whether Amaker chooses to stick with the youngster if he struggles early.
LEADING FROM THE BACK LINE
In a Dartmouth game where his classmates exploded for career highs and 49 combined points, captain Evan Cummins’ contributions were a footnote. However, the unheralded captain has excelled recently, scoring in double digits in four of the last five games after accomplishing the feat just twice in the first 10 contests. He has developed good chemistry with junior forward Zena Edosomwan, who found Cummins four separate times for baskets against Dartmouth. Versus a small Ryerson front line, Cummins and Edosomwan should be able to be dominant.
CROSS-BORDER BATTLES
Ryerson is the second Canadian team that the Crimson has played in 2015-2016. In an earlier scrimmage against McGill, Harvard struggled, scrapping out a 66-63 victory on Nov. 7. Ryerson, who beat McGill by three in October, has been the better team thus far this season. The Canadian squad beats opponents behind the arc, shooting an average of 34 threes a game and converting 35 percent. More than half of their attempts come from behind the three-point line, as guards Ammanuel Diressa and Roshane Roberts take nearly 12 combined treys a game. The Crimson holds opponents to just 26.6 percent shooting from behind the arc while shooting 41.4 percent themselves, and the game will likely be decided behind the arc.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team and No. 1 women’s team started off 2016 with Ivy League play against No. 1 and No. 2 Penn, respectively. The teams returned to the Murr Center after a couple of weeks of rest on Saturday, and both came out strong against their Ivy League rival, picking up identical 6-3 wins.

A winless men’s team (1-1, 1-1 Ivy) struggling to find its rhythm began its five game home stretch against an undefeated Penn (6-1, 0-1), which had had its best start to a season since 1985-6. It looked to bounce back from its season opener loss against Dartmouth in December, the first loss of the kind since 1977.
“We made a lot of tactical and mental changes to our games leading into our match vs. Penn that clearly paid off,” said junior men’s co-captain Devin McLaughlin. “We had better game-plans and were far more mentally tough, and that showed come game day.”
At the No. 1 position, Penn’s sophomore Anders Larsen broke sophomore David Ryan’s undefeated streak, but not without giving up two games in the match. At the No. 2 and No. 3 positions, sophomore Bradley Smith and junior co-captain Bryan Koh both took down their opponents, 3-2.
There were only sweeps in the second flight, with junior Dylan Murray and McLaughlin picking up wins over their opponents in the fifth and sixth positions. This is Murray’s first win of the season, while McLaughlin remains undefeated this season.
It was also sophomore Seif Eleinen’s first win of the season at the No. 8 position, with a 3-1 decision over senior Tyler Odell. Freshman Alexi Gossett earned his first win with the Crimson at the No. 7 position in convincing fashion with a 3-0 sweep over his opponent. In the last position, sophomore Mandela Patrick was unable to best freshman Jonathan Zeitels.
“I was extremely pleased with how our team played this weekend,” McLaughlin said. “We were united, focused, and professional, which were things that weren't necessarily as apparent a few weeks prior.”
The women’s team (3-0, 2-0) had never dropped a New Year opener under head coach Mike Way, but could have faced the possibility of ending the streak as it faced the Quakers (4-1, 0-1)., which is the last team to which Harvard had lost. Coming into the game, Penn was also undefeated, having outscored opponents 107-1 and dropped only one game.
“This is always one of our bigger matches, so there was definitely a lot of excitement around it,” co-captain Isabelle Dowling said. “We felt very confident in our lineup, however, so I think there was more excitement than nervous energy.”
The match at the No. 1 position was a battle of the freshmen breakouts, as Harvard’s Sabrina Sobhy took on Penn’s freshman Reeham Salah. Salah had swept all of her opponents and gave up more than three points only once—that is, until she faced Sobhy, where her Crimson counterpart soundly defeated her 3-1. This is Sobhy’s first win of the season at the first position.
In the second flight, senior Michelle Gemmell and sophomore Sue Ann Yong both defeated their opponents 3-1 at the fifth and sixth positions, respectively, while junior Katherine Tutrone was unable to best Penn’s sophomore Marie Stephan, who swept her.
Junior Dileas MacGowan’s undefeated streak was broken at the hands of senior Haidi Lala, who edged MacGowan out in a hard fought 3-2 battle at the No. 7 position. Freshman Sophie Mehta and co-captain Saumya Karki both easily handled their opponents in the last two positions.
Fellow freshman Kayley Leonard swept her opponent at the No. 2 position. Sophomore Alyssa Mehta rounded out the top flight, and though she won a game against Penn’s senior Yan Xin Tan, she ultimately fell 3-1.
“I thought everyone did a very solid job of executing their game plans,” Dowling said. “Our fitness work over the past couple of weeks definitely paid off.”
With these wins, both Harvard teams handed Penn its first loss of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first Ivy League matchup of the season, the Harvard women’s basketball team came away with a win over Dartmouth on Saturday night. Playing in Hanover, N.H., the Crimson held its opponent to a season low 43 points on 32 percent shooting from the field.
In its last matchup of a five game road trip, it was Harvard’s defense that made the difference in the matchup. Forcing 19 turnovers and out-rebounding the Big Green (5-12, 0-1 Ivy) 45 to 36, the Crimson (6-8, 1-0) never trailed after tying the game four minutes into the first quarter.
“Everybody stepped up,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Everybody on the team rebounded and that’s the kind of effort that we need. There was a big difference in our intensity and our grit on defense.”
Despite shooting 35 percent from the field and 25 percent from beyond the arc, Harvard came away with the 56-43 victory with four players in double digits. The Crimson’s three seniors—AnnMarie Healy, Kit Metoyer, and Shilpa Tummala—lead the way with a combined 35 points and 20 rebounds. Junior forward Destiny Nunley added 11 points and seven rebounds.
After opening the period with a layup and a three, Dartmouth was held to a single field goal over the next nine minutes of play. During this time, Harvard was able to put up 12 consecutive points and ended the quarter up 15-7.
“Defense has been our focus through the whole season and it was great to see our team play such great team defense,” Healy said. “I think they definitely had some strong players who really knew how to shoot and get their shot and go to the basket and we were able to lock in. Everyone was able to shut them down through help defense and rotation.”
After trading shots for much of the second quarter the Big Green pulled within six points off three made jumpers in a row. The Crimson responded with three in a row as well, putting the lead back at 12.
With Dartmouth playing zone, Harvard was forced to take a lot of shots from outside. Despite being forced outside the paint, the Crimson still managed to put up 26 points down low to the Big Green’s 10.
“They played zone most of the game which is why we took a lot of threes,” Delaney-Smith said. “Again, we shot below par. You can’t win a ballgame shooting like that, but you can if you work hard on defense, and hold a team to 43 points, and out-rebound them.”
For Harvard, the defensive effort went beyond the boards. The Crimson stole the ball nine times, with five coming from Tummala. Harvard doubled the Big Green’s points off turnovers with 14 to Dartmouth’s seven. Despite shooting 28 percent from the field in the third quarter the Crimson ended the quarter up by 12 on a three from Tummala and a layup from Nunley.
“This whole game can be described in one word and that’s ‘team,’” Healy said. “On offense it was great because we were sharing the ball and they played a lot of zone and we were able to be slow and controlled and find the open player.”
After shooting 15-of-48 through the first three quarters the Crimson’s offense lit up in the fourth quarter. Shooting 50 percent Harvard pushed the lead to 19 off three jumpshots and two threes. Metoyer would score seven of her 12 on 3-of-3 shooting in the period.
Despite a 9-0 run from the Big Green late in the fourth the Crimson would hold on for the win. After going 2-6 on the road the win was well welcomed.
“For us it’s huge,” Delaney-Smith said. “We let a lot of games slip that we felt we should have won. When you have a young team then it chips away at your confidence. Every coach in the world will tell you that winning cures all so it was a really big win for us.”
