After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It can be quite tricky, even futile, to criticize a novel when its author openly acknowledges its imperfections. In the opening pages of Daniel Torday’s “The Last Flight of Poxl West,” fifteen-year-old Eli stumbles upon a New York Times Book Review critique of “Skylock,” his uncle’s memoir, which happens to comprise the majority of Torday’s own book. The reviewer complains that “Skylock” contains “some odd formalities of language” and “its second half is stronger than its first.” A cheeky, meta-fictional means of explaining away the novel’s faults? Perhaps. It would be a risky move if “The Last Flight” proved lackluster; fortunately, despite the fictional critic’s astute observations, Torday’s breathtaking, vivid descriptions of war-torn Europe and undeniable storytelling skills render his debut mesmerizing. Though the book hits a few patches of rough air early in the story, “The Last Flight of Poxl West” ultimately soars: it’s a masterfully crafted, wise examination of the enduring ache of lost love, the veracity of memory, and the disparity between the stories one wants to hear and those one needs.
“The Last Flight” revolves around Eli Goldstein, a baseball-loving Jewish teenager who idolizes his surrogate uncle, Poxl West (né Leopold Weisberg). With Eli’s encouragement, West pens and publishes “Skylock,” a memoir detailing his sensational adventures in the midst of World War II, including fighting for the Allies as an RAF bomber and his ongoing affair with a Dutch prostitute. But the memoir’s surprise success elicits rumors of possibly fabricated material, challenging Eli’s perception of Poxl, heroism, and the importance of truth. The narrative, which shifts between excerpts from “Skylock” and Eli’s memories of his uncle’s fall from grace, is ambitious for a first-time novelist and ultimately somewhat peripheral to the novel. While Torday’s ability to recount the same events from diametrically opposite viewpoints is impressive, it does little to enhance the emotional and intellectual heft provided by the already powerful happenings within “The Last Flight.”
Choosing to tell the story from two distinct perspectives necessitates the creation of two unique voices, generations apart. Here Torday generally succeeds, particularly with the plucky Eli. Though over three-fourths of the novel is dedicated to Poxl’s journey, Torday manages to fit in a full transformative arc for his young protagonist. Eli’s evolution from naive child tirelessly devoted to his uncle to scrutinizing adult probably reads so realistically because decades ago, Torday was Eli—a teenage Jewish-American seeking comfort in baseball stars and older heroes. He was not, however, an elderly, former RAF pilot who may or may have lied about his past, which makes Poxl slightly more difficult to flesh out. Torday perfectly captures the heightened, occasionally awkward phrasing of those learning English as a second language, but Poxl’s decisions sometimes fail to align with his clearly stated rationale, lessening the believability of his character.
While Torday’s sweeping vision of the intertwined narrative occasionally falters, his prodigious talents as an author compensate for the novel’s structural faults. Having amassed both critical acclaim for stories in the short fiction collective Glimmer Train and a National Jewish Book Award for his novella “The Sensualist,” Torday has already begun to prove himself a literary force. In finally penning a novel, he’s allotted himself more space to plumb the depths of his creativity, and the results are astounding. Torday possesses an uncanny, painterly eye for detail; his prose is lucid, elegant, and, more often than not, tantamount to pure poetry. Midway through his time fighting in the war, Poxl notes, “I had come to see my destiny as a line stitched in a glove: bending and bobbing above and below leather—but always by design”; years later, these events trail him “like the sweet whiff of cherry tobacco from a pipe smoker’s coat.” Torday’s insistence on transforming even the most mundane of events or ideas into visually resplendent feasts, each word meticulously chosen to improve the aural aesthetic of a line, prevents "The Last Flight" from wavering even during unusually lengthy lulls in action.
Luckily, Torday didn’t devote his time solely to constructing a plethora of gorgeous metaphors; it’s clear from the precision of his details that the author also researched the look and energy of a World War II-era Europe. From Poxl’s life in the idyllic Czechoslovakian countryside to his time in bustling Amsterdam, from driving an ambulance through the burning streets of London to piloting an RAF bomber through the clouds of Germany, Torday ostensibly covers every major facet of life during the war. Herein, however, lies the fundamental problem with "The Last Flight”: he stuffs his novel with countless plot points, and so many of them go undeveloped. Torday so generously describes minute, ultimately irrelevant details—the chiseled stone of British buildings, the sunlight peeking over treetops, sheets of rain pattering against metal roofs—that he eschews developing major relationships and critical aspects of the plot. He flies through Poxl’s life faster than a Spitfire across an open sky, causing Poxl’s decisions to feel hasty or shallow. Torday’s writing is brilliant, but but in the future he needs better to determine what elements of his story truly merit such detailed accounts.
As a novel-within-a-novel, packed with two interwoven narratives, five acts, and a myriad of settings, “The Last Flight of Poxl West” is busy, a massive undertaking that would intimidate even the most established of authors. Admittedly, the novel does have a tendency to feel both incredibly detailed and rushed. But Torday’s indisputable, immense talent as a writer and storyteller manage to keep "The Last Flight" from dipping dangerously close to the haphazard. The previously mentioned, faux New York Times Book Review article ultimately deems “Skylock” unforgettable: “I don’t think I’ve been so moved by a book in recent memory,” the reviewer writes. While "The Last Flight" itself is strong, it’s Torday’s writing style—dazzling, witty, and heartfelt—that make his novel one to remember.

T. C. Boyle is an award-winning novelist and short-story writer who teaches English at the University of Southern California. Over the phone, he’s calm and affable—his slightly-accented voice immediately puts you at ease. He tells you that you don’t need to record this phone call—the TSA already has that covered. You don’t question it; he sounds very sure. Boyle is currently on tour promoting his newest novel, “The Harder They Come,” and on April 22 he gave a talk at the Brattle Theatre sponsored by the Harvard Book Store.
The Harvard Crimson: You’re in Portland right now promoting your new book. How’s the touring lifestyle treating you?
T. C. Boyle: The most difficult thing…about being on the road on an endless tour is underwear. What are you gonna do about your underwear? You have to be in the same hotel for two days to get your underwear washed. What I’m working on in my basement lab is the concept of the edible underwear. Why bother to wash it—just eat it.
THC: Eat it?
TCB: You have to use cellulose. Remember that our appendix is a vestigial organ that once allowed us, in our naked days, to digest cellulose—as, for instance, the beaver can. So first we have to re-stimulate that with a patented drug that I’m also working on. Then we could easily have all our clothes—everything—made out of newspaper. You’re into newspaper—why recycle it? Just eat it! Of course you’ll have to have a ton of some delicious sauce.
THC: Very eco-friendly. Has the environment always been a passion of yours?
TCB: I’ve been at USC more than 30 years, and when I first came to California to live in L.A., I couldn’t stand it! So I found a place in the Sierra Nevada—in the Sequoia National Parks. Only 19 people live there year round, it’s at 7200 feet, and I’ve been going there ever since for several months. Winter and summer.… When I’m there, you know, I feel that life isn’t so bad and that people aren’t so bad as opposed to when I read the newspaper at home. And when I’m done with work, instead of hassling with normal life, I am out in the woods on my own. In fact I describe myself as an environmentalist not because I’m marching in the street with placards but because I like to be in the woods by myself.
THC: Sounds like you do a lot of writing out in your cabin. Do you think that isolationist streak has influenced your development as a novelist?
TCB: As a writer, I’ve been so fortunate to be able to follow what interests me and to see what my themes are. The themes go back to the environment, really, and what attracted me to this particular story is… going back to the wilderness.... The ability [we once had] to go off into the wilderness and get out [our] aggressions is over. So I wonder—and I’m not a sociologist, but I just wonder—if maybe this is why we find this tremendous antipathy towards society and its rules. I mean antipathy way beyond simply being rebellious, but really hating society to the point of wanting to take it down and take everybody with you.
THC: It seems like a lot of your work tends to focus on people on the fringes—those who can’t quite align with the dominant currents of society.
TCB: I’m always interested in the people on the outside of society. And in this case, as the book begins to evolve, [it] turns out to be about this deep-seated American anti-authoritarianism. It’s part of all of us…when you’re in school, they teach you to be skeptical of authority and not to march in lockstep with everybody and to think independently. Great, that’s who I am. But on the other hand, we have a society where everybody’s freedom impinges upon everybody else’s…. The book is specifically about a shooter who goes crazy and wants to take society down with him. So what is society, and how do we decide where we’re going to agree to have a limitation on our individual freedoms to do anything that we want in order to respect what somebody else wants to do?
THC: Any closing thoughts?
TCB: I’ve been very lucky to have an audience for my work so that I just make my own art in the way that I want. I don’t calculate, I don’t sell—I don’t care about that. Once it’s published, of course, I go around like I’m doing now—the publisher sends me here and there... But my work is just my own meditation on the world. I’m able and all my life have been able to do this and not have to answer to anyone.

The fluorescent lights glare against the all-white walls and furniture of the jail visitation room. Two men sit across from each other, each accused of a crime. “So I read the paper,” says Jonah Hill (in the role of Michael Finkel) to James Franco, who sits across from him at a jail visitation room table, playing the role of alleged family murderer Christian Longo. “Did you do it?” Without missing a beat, Franco fires back, “I should be asking you the same thing.”
This brief exchange encompasses the two largest ways in which Rupert Goold’s latest film fails. First, delivered with a sad attempt at sincerity, these lines showcase the fact that the typically comedic duo of Franco and Hill never actually achieves a serious or believable tone; Second, the moment represents the overdone symbolic comparison Goold forces. Look at these men, the film seems to demand, and explain how they are any different—neither one honors the Truth. Ultimately Hill and Franco spend 100 minutes attempting to prove their merit as serious actors in a film that, for its part, detrimentally places an overwrought attempt at symbolism above any appreciable plot.
Based on a true story, the film traces the relationship that develops between the two men when, after being arrested in Mexico, Longo identifies himself as Michael Finkel. This grabs the attention of the failing journalist, who has just lost his job at the New York Times Magazine for fabricating parts of his most recent cover story. With no other employment prospects, Finkel travels across the country to cover Longo’s story, eventually turning it into a book titled, naturally, “True Story.”
The heavy-handed attempt to force a connection between the characters begins in the film’s opening scenes. The entire exposition is done in parallel fashion, interspersing moments from Finkel’s life with moments from Longo’s. This technique is utilized most blatantly to suggest that both men are guilty of lying, scenes of a recently disgraced Finkel mixing with shots of an imprisoned Franco. The shots in themselves are not poorly done, but the blaringly obvious message they are meant to convey takes away from any artistic merit they might have otherwise possessed.
While the blatant parallelism is bothersome, it does at least contribute to the overall plot and leaves nothing to be resolved. Such is not true for other lengths the film goes to in order to draw connections—most notably, the similarity in the men’s writing styles. Early in the movie, Longo writes his illustrated life story to Finkel. In an eerie moment, Finkel (who has been obsessively scouring the pages, nailing them to the walls of his girlfriend’s house) realizes that they are designed exactly like his personal journals, complete with small in-text illustrations and self-made page borders. This understandably rattles him, but unfortunately this riveting coincidence is not brought up again. It merely is tossed into the trashcan full of undeveloped and unnecessary comparisons.
While these elements are frustrating, the film is not entirely without merit. At times Goold’s cinematography is impressive, if not haunting. One such instance is a scene in which Longo calls Finkel’s girlfriend Jill (Felicity Jones) late at night, claiming that he feels like he already knows her from his conversations with Finkel and wants to be her friend while relaying intimate details of her life back to her. As she moves through the room, obviously uncomfortable, Goold captures her image through the windows. Interspersed with shots of Longo running his fingers over the telephone, the scene expertly conveys a deeply troubling sense of voyeurism.
The cast is, likewise, not completely disappointing. While Franco and Hill fail to produce stellar performances—it is consistently impossible to distinguish whether Franco as an actor is delivering his lines without sincerity or playing a character who lives and speaks from behind a poorly constructed veneer, and Hill consistently over acts, coming across more as the star of an unfortunate high school play—Jones shines. Her portrayal of Jill never feels forced or overdone. Perhaps the film’s most damning mistake was not featuring her more.
“True Story” is ultimately a failure in that it takes a genuinely intriguing story and manages to take it nowhere. When initially deciding to tell Longo’s story, Finkel is met with some resistance. “I’m not sure Christina Longo deserves to have his story heard,” says one doubter. “Everybody deserves to have their story heard,” Finkel responds. Taken as an inspiration for the film, this statement raises a question—if every story deserves to be heard, does it also deserve to be told well? Judging from “True Story,” the answer would appear to be no.

It is a curious world we live in, where a fake newscaster is the king of real news. While the top-rated news anchor leaves in disgrace, it is the Comedy Central comedian who retires with a Cronkite-like following. Such contrasts are testaments to Jon Stewart’s talent—it is his natural charisma and hard work that transformed the Daily Show from a fringe comedy broadcast to a major staple of millennials’ media diets over the course of Stewart's 16-year hosting tenure.
A large part of Jon Stewart’s appeal stems from the way in which he has made news and politics accessible to a wide audience; through the Daily Show, Stewart has created a means of presenting serious issues in an entertaining and incisive manner. Heads of state, senators, Nobel Prize winners, and movie stars alike now appear on the show, turning the Daily Show into an invaluable source of information and entertainment for a wide audience, both at home and abroad. Stewart must be commended for his work, and he will surely be missed. Filling Stewart's shoes is sure to prove a difficult task. But until Stewart's replacement, Trevor Noah, has confronted that difficulty, judging his comedic ability is misplaced.
Noah is certianly untested: Noah was chosen after just three appearances on the Daily Show as a correspondent. Some have questioned the lack of women in comedy; others have questioned Noah’s Twitter account; others still have questioned his comedic ability and lack of experience. But even a comic great would have mammoth-sized shoes to fill, given the impact that Stewart has had. In truth, it is difficult to imagine how Noah can compete with the shadow of his predecessor, who has built one of this generation’s great cultural icons nearly from the ground up.
Ultimately though, we have yet to see who Noah will truly be as the host of the Daily Show. He will begin his tenure right as the 2016 presidential campaign and all its attendant mudslinging kicks into high gear; it is not inconceivable that the top story most nights will be about an electoral process in a country that he moved to only four years ago. Yet to be seen is his grasp on American culture and politics—vital for a show that, despite its international appeal, is firmly grounded as an American comedy program. Also uncertain are his interview skills, central to a third of each broadcast, his style of delivery, sense of humor, and presence. These are all attributes that separate the good comedians from the greats; we do not know yet whether Noah is one of the former or has the makings of the latter.
It is a far too early to know the answers to all these questions, and at this point the strong negative reaction to Noah’s appointment is far from warranted. When he takes over this fall or next spring, we will surely quickly discover the answers to all our most pressing Daily Show questions. But until then, we can only wonder about our fake news and laud Mr. Stewart for the tremendous job that he has done.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few things make me happier than drinking coffee on the broken tailgate of Jake’s pick-up while the summer sun rises over the farm. Cutting heads of lettuce with one perfect, clean stroke is one of them. Picking wineberries from thorny bushes until the marginal cost of bloody hands catches up to the marginal pleasure of their sweet, tart taste is another.
The type of happiness I derive from these things is an intoxicating brand of exotic pleasure. Read the first sentence of this article again. Tell me it’s not weird. Tell me you didn’t roll your eyes. An Ivy League millennial—let alone an Indian boy from New Jersey—shouldn’t engage the farming idyll. And maybe that’s why I do. Farming is the closest I’ve gotten to a cocaine addiction. It makes up for years of absent teenage angst and rebellion in a guy whose badassery had been limited to talking trash at his third grade Field Day.
This forbidden and unordinary value that we—that I—place on agriculture attracts fewer people to the field than an increasingly insatiable America needs. Around this time of year in 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack aimed to increase the number of American farmers by 100,000 by now. Instead, the volume of new farmers has plummeted by 20 percent. Naturally, this means the country has a disproportionately old (read: dying) population of farmers, only six percent of whom are 35 or younger.
There’s a problem here—one that should be addressed with policy. Many young prospective farmers give up on careers in agriculture because of high start up capital costs, which are often compounded by the burden of student debt. The federal government created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program as an incentive for young people to enter careers that provide public good by subsidizing or forgiving their outstanding loans. The program currently comprises budding teachers, doctors, and other obvious do-gooders but does not recognize farming as a public service. The National Young Farmers Coalition and other organizations are advocating on behalf of young farmers whose careers are obviated by the contents of their wallets to try to change that. Young farmers are serving our most universal, most fundamental need: the need to eat. They are true public servants even in the strictest sense.
But policy can only do so much. The real issue at hand is educated America’s exotification of agriculture. At this critical juncture, where an aging and conformist class of farmers is being phased out, farming must be rebranded to turn those with the skills and passion for innovation into a new generation of sustainable, forward-thinking agriculturists. They don’t need an agriculture degree as much as business savvy, social capital, and a desire to learn. Most importantly, they need the moral courage and foresight to get over educated America’s allergy to a profession that may not have the glamour of the finance-consulting-law school trifecta, but has far more utility. It’s time to retire the myths that make agriculture foreign and third-class. You don’t need to wear a John Deere hat to drive a John Deere.
Consider agriculture. Join this food job opportunities email list. WWOOF somewhere. Or at the very least, don’t dismiss a friend who does any of this as an irrational soul-searcher overcompensating for an absent cocaine addiction. He might be one, but whether he cares or not, there is great social and intellectual value in producing our nation’s food supply—no matter what Mom, Dad, or OCS says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve never been sexually assaulted. I’ve never been afraid for my personal safety during a sexual encounter. I’ve never been physically forced to do something I didn’t want to do.
On a related note, I have a Johnson.
This doesn’t mean I haven’t had sexual encounters in which I failed to give constant affirmative consent—encounters that would be deemed sexual assault under a yes-means-yes policy. It also doesn’t mean that I haven’t had highly regrettable sexual experiences—ones that weighed heavy on my psyche for months after they happened.
However, when I look at the systemic problem of sexual assault on a macro level, I have a hard time seeing why I, or other men, should take up airspace talking about our experiences being assaulted by women when women are still so much more likely to be assaulted by men.
After all, even when I’ve failed to affirmatively consent in the past (even when I’ve technically been assaulted) I have always been in control of the situation. As a man, I’ve always known that the country’s institutions, courts, and wealth are controlled by people of my gender—that if I report a crime, I will be heard, and if I fight back, I will be able to escape. Women cannot say the same thing.
This is why I was so disappointed when I clicked “submit” on Harvard’s highly-publicized sexual conduct survey without having to answer any questions on whether or not I’ve ever been the perpetrator of sexual violence. How can our school claim to be conducting a comprehensive survey on sexual assault without attempting to determine the presence of assaulters? Isn’t this kind of one-sided questioning the moral equivalent of investigating a murder by asking everyone in a society whether they, too, have been murdered, instead of whether or not they have killed anybody?
If we only allow students at Harvard to play the role of victim, we are failing to take ownership over our environment. We are allowing men to view assault as a passive act—as something that just happens to someone, instead of something that someone (generally, a male) actively does to someone else (generally, a female). We are effectively choosing to say, “Women were raped,” instead of, “Men raped women.”
In doing so, Harvard and Westat, the independent research firm that created the survey, implicitly absolve Harvard’s male students of responsibility. This kind of hands-off approach to targeting assaulters (an approach that depicts Harvard as a place where people are either assaulted or innocent) creates the impression that Harvard students don’t commit sexual assault and that men aren’t disproportionately guilty. In the process, Harvard and Westat establish a destructive false equivalency between the physically, socially, and culturally different experiences of men and women who face assault.
I recall one night in high-school when I took this equivalency to heart and told a girl who made a move on me that I was “too drunk to consent, and [didn’t] want to be raped.” Sure, I may have had a few too many drinks that night, but I was never in danger and I never feared for my personal safety; we also definitely weren't going to have sex. So, telling her that I was too drunk to consent—and then, telling all of my friends the story—perpetuated the idea that all sexual assault (and, in this case, rape) is something that can be avoided with a light-hearted joke, when, in reality, women do not have that luxury.
According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 38 percent of sexual violence is committed against men, and obviously, if we had infinite resources at our disposal, we would work tirelessly to put an end to all sexual violence. To this point, so-called manrape in prisons and schools remains a serious issue with serious consequences. But when 20 to 25 percent of women in higher educational institutions will be victims of completed or attempted sexual assault by the time they graduate, when 9 out of 10 female victims know their offender, and when women have to be careful about leaving their drinks out at parties and leaving parties with people they see as friends, female-on-male rape becomes almost irrelevant.
As a man, I make 100 cents on the dollar, I’m almost always physically in control, and, yes, I have a Johnson.
I am not a victim.

Harvard University Dining Services is increasing focus on sustainability at this year's Yardfest, the College’s outdoor concert headlined by Jessie J, with a buffet featuring completely compostable dishware in an effort to reduce waste at the event.
According to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin, the dining service has eliminated aluminum soda cans from the offerings and offering a "‘hydration station’ of infused waters and agua frescas, all of which are served in compostable cups.”
“We offer the meal as a buffet, which limits waste and packaging, and serve it on compostable disposables,” she said.
In addition to providing sustainable dishware, the College Events Board, which organizes Yardfest, worked with HUDS to develop a menu consisting of environmentally-friendly food, according to Dakota D. Santana-Grace ’16, co-chair of the CEB.
The menu, which was released by the CEB via email on Thursday, will consist of burgers, Caesar salad, pasta salad, ice cream sandwiches, and agua frescas.
Santana-Grace added that the food and beverages were the primary environmental concerns associated with the event, which will be hosted in Tercentenary Theater on Friday afternoon.
“In terms of the actual event, we have low waste levels, since most of it is reusable,” he said. “The electronics that we bring are reusable, and the gates that we put up around the Yard are used for other events.”

With the goal of finding the perfect combination for Harvard diners, Harvard Campus Services continues to experiment with the selection of food trucks serving in the Science Center Plaza under the University’s Common Spaces Initiative.
For years, Harvard has been bringing food trucks from local companies to the plaza, and Campus Services continues to experiment with the diversity of offerings. The current selection of six regularly scheduled food trucks includes Bon Me, Captain Marden’s Seafoods, and Rhythm and Wraps.
“We feel like we found our niche,” said Aaron Cohen, owner of Rhythm and Wraps, which operates a food truck for lunch on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
According to Cohen, Rhythm and Wraps was invited by Harvard to operate in the Science Center Plaza for a “brief trial period” that took place this past winter. Now, Rhythm and Wraps is staying at Harvard for an extended trial period, which is expected to last through summer.
Campus Services uses trial periods to determine which food trucks are most popular among Harvard affiliates, inviting only the most frequented to stay.
“All you need is to look and see the line for Bon Me and know that’s a popular choice,” said Meredith L. Weenick, the vice president of Campus Services.
The daily combination of food trucks available is determined by a strict schedule controlled by Campus Services. Each individual food truck company is told exactly which days of the week they can operate in the Science Center Plaza. As part of the agreement between Harvard and the trucks, food trucks must pay a $50 fee each day they conduct business in the plaza.
According to Weenick, Campus Services manages the times when trucks operate both to ensure the safety of people in the plaza when the trucks drive in and out and to minimize crowds on days when special events or fairs are scheduled to take place. On those days, Harvard may invite fewer food trucks in order maximize the use of the Science Center Plaza.
“We are still in the experimentation phase,” Weenick said. “Last summer, we had an ice cream truck. I don’t think he’s coming back. So, we are still trying to figure out what the right mix is.”
The Common Spaces Initiative is a program launched in 2009 that seeks to nurture a stronger sense of community by establishing areas for communal activity. Their past projects include art exhibits, outdoor performances, and special events and activities.

A man allegedly exposed himself to a Harvard student at about 11:45 p.m. on Wednesday, according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. There has not been an arrest.
This incident, which took place on Mt. Auburn St. near the corner of JFK St., according to Warnick, comes after another case of indecent exposure that occurred nearby Quincy House on Sunday.
The two cases, however, seem to be unrelated, as the description of this suspect does not match that of the alleged Quincy House perpetrator, Warnick said Thursday afternoon.
“This appears to be a random incident,” Warnick said.
According to Warnick, the victim, whose identity has not been released, appears to have initially reported the crime to the Harvard University Police Department. A HUPD officer had joined the victim by the time CPD arrived.
The alleged crime, however, falls under CPD's jurisdiction, because it occurred outside of Harvard property.
After hearing the victim’s description of what had happened, CPD took the victim to a group of other individuals who had been stopped by another officer in the area in an attempt to identify a potential suspect, Warnick said.
No potential suspect was identified among the group members, Warnick said.
“It’s an officer awareness situation at this point, in terms of utilizing that description that was provided to us, and keeping a keen eye in that particular area for someone that may match that description,” Warnick said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speakers from the arts and technology sectors came together on Thursday for “Art, Technology, Psyche,” an all-day conference hosted by the Digital Futures consortium and the Digital Arts and Humanities Group, which aimed to spark a dialogue among those interested in the intersection of the two fields.
“Art and technology are both human creations; the wisdom underneath that is what we’re trying to get to,” said Christopher Morse, a research computing specialist at DARTH, who co-organized the event with Susan Berstler, information technology coordinator for Tozzer and Cabot libraries.
Tod Machover, a professor of music and media at MIT, opened the event with a keynote address titled “Meditated Music: From Robot Operas to City Symphonies and Beyond.” Machover, who is currently composing symphonies compiled from sound files collected in various cities, spoke about the “empathy” behind his cross-disciplinary work and how melding art and technology together resonates with the psyche.
While Machover views technology as a common language of the 21st century, Berstler added that “it’s the dialogue about it that’s the important part.”
In addition to Machover, Henry “Trae” Winter III, an astrophysicist with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, spoke about digitally analyzing images of the sun, and James Yamada, a creative technologist with metaLAB, spoke about origami and its analogues to digital modeling.
The artwork on display featured a large-scale collaboration between the Harvard Ceramics Department and the Graduate School of Design, which utilized computation and information technologies in ceramic design.
The event took place at Arts @ 29 Garden, a space intended to facilitate creativity amongst students, faculty members, and others affiliated with Harvard. According to Berstler, the space was chosen because it allowed for two levels of simultaneous events, as well as a space for attendees to sit and converse. Attendees said the event made progress toward collaboration among fields that, while related, are not inherently collaborative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2015, at 12:25 a.m.
Academy-award winning actress Natalie Portman ’03, known for her roles in psychological thriller “Black Swan” and the “Star Wars” prequel trilogy, will be the College’s 2015 Class Day speaker.
Portman, who studied psychology at the College, has acted in more than 35 feature films and was the first College graduate to win an Academy Award for best actress, which she received in 2010 for her role in “Black Swan.” She acted in 11 films before she graduated.
Most recently, Portman wrote, directed, and acted in the movie “A Tale of Love and Darkness,” which will premiere at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.
Portman has also served as an ambassador of hope for the microfinance nonprofit FINCA and an ambassador for the charity Free The Children. Recently, she signed an open letter calling for University alumni  to gather in Harvard Yard for the Harvard “Heat Week” protest.
After Portman won an Oscar for Best Actress in 2010, Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, who taught a course called “Neurophysiology and the Law” that Portman took, commented that “she would be a great psychologist, and she’s a great actor.”
“She probably influences more people in her acting,” he said in a 2010 Crimson article, adding that “her psychology background helped her in formulating the role for ['Black Swan'] ... She’s an actor who uses her academic background.”
While a student at the College, Portman also worked as a research assistant in the lab of former psychology professor Stephen M. Kosslyn.
The selection process for Class Day speaker began last fall when seniors were surveyed about potential candidates, according to a press release. A subcommittee of students led by two class marshals convened and deliberated on the speaker suggestions, ultimately selecting Portman.
Class Day, scheduled for May 27, honors students graduating from the College the day before the official Commencement ceremony.

Two attorneys from the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice solicited input from College students Thursday as the group prepares to intervene against a pending lawsuit that alleges that Harvard uses “racially and ethnically discriminatory policies” in its admissions process.
The group seeks to file an intervention lawsuit and join in on the University’s opposition to the Project on Fair Representation’s original suit against Harvard. According to staff attorney Matthew Cregor, student input has been a critical part of a counterclaim filed in another PFOR lawsuit against the University of North Carolina.
Through filing an intervention, a third party can request to join an ongoing lawsuits.
The lawyers met with students at an off-the-record meeting hosted by the Black Students Association. They discussed a possible timeline for legal action against PFOR’s discrimination lawsuit.
“The student voice in prior lawsuits was a really effective thing...we encourage students here to be in touch with students in North Carolina,” Cregor said. “If this is a lawsuit that students are opposed to, we want to know.”
Priya A. Lane, who represented the Lawyer’s Committee along with Cregor, said the organization is interested in intervening on behalf of students.
Cregor said federal cases involving third-party interventions can take a long time and that his organization is a non-profit that works on behalf of clients pro bono. He added that he plans to follow up with some students who attended Thursday’s meeting.
The Facebook page promoting event said the lawyers’ deadline to file their claim is Monday.
This is the organization’s first visit to Harvard’s campus, according to Cregor. He declined to comment on the specifics of how the meeting with BSA was arranged. He also declined to comment on whether his organization was coordinating with Harvard in its legal filing denying claims of discrimination. Harvard has denied all of the allegations made by PFOR.
Students who attended the meeting said that while they thought attendance could have been better, they found the discussion informative.
Winnie Wu ’16 said most people who attended the meeting were minority students, and that it seemed “the general consensus was that the [PFOR] lawsuit was bad.”
Lane also said that generally students in attendance seemed to be against the suit by PFOR.
Abby Duker ’18 said that during the question and answer period, students asked the lawyers various questions including about possible backup plans.
“Everyone in there seems very passionate about making Harvard a more inclusive place for minorities,” Duker said.

Jonathan B. Losos ’84, professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, spoke about the relevance of islands to the study of evolution at the Geological Lecture Hall on Thursday evening.
This presentation preceded a special preview of “Islands: Evolving in Isolation," a new exhibit which will be on display at the Harvard Museum of Natural History beginning Saturday. Janis Sacco, director of exhibitions for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, spearheaded the creation of the exhibit, which Losos also advised from inception to realization.
At the event, Losos emphasized the integral role of islands to the study of evolutionary biology, citing as an example the way that Charles Darwin pooled evidence from species on the Galapagos Islands to support his theory of evolution by natural selection.
“We don’t study islands because we are interested in evolution on islands,” Losos said. “We study islands because they are a particularly good place to understand evolution in general.”
The small scale of island ecosystems allows for greater insight into evolutionary patterns exhibited therein, Losos said. He spoke about islands’ ability to serve as “nature’s test tubes of evolution” by illustrating what evolution is capable of in very diverse environments.
Attendees of the event said they were drawn to the talk for reasons ranging from an interest in evolution on islands, the new exhibit’s unveiling, and Losos’s notoriety as an influential researcher in the field of evolutionary biology, with his specific research involving evolutionary radiation of Caribbean Anolis lizards.
“Seeing how the ideas about diversity are generated from isolated populations that undergo their own selection events from certain traits in the environment is really cool,” said Jasmin Camacho, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
The exhibit is designed to reflect many of the themes that Losos discussed, including the depiction of complex intersections of biodiversity and evolution, which use a vast array of plant and animal specimens from islands across the globe.
“The novel thing about it is putting all these examples together in one place, and taking advantage of the great specimen collection that we have to illustrate these processes,” Losos said.

Krzysztof Wodiczko, the artist behind the large-scale video projection animating the John Harvard Statue in Harvard Yard this week, discussed the role of art in public space to generate community at Harvard and create a forum for a diversity of voices.
Wodiczko, a professor in residence at the Graduate School of Design, spoke Thursday evening at the Carpenter Center, followed by a brief panel featuring moderators James Voorhies, the director of the Carpenter Center, and Silvia C. Benedito, an assistant professor at the GSD.
Wodiczko stressed the importance of the public space as a canvas for his work.
“The public space seems like something frightening, but it also brings hope,” he said. “It’s a place to escape from the private space, one in which we can open up and communicate with one another.”
Wodiczko described his journey to find the public space that did not exist in his native Poland under the Soviet Regime.
“I never really found it, and I came to realize that that space must be created,” he said. “If you bring it into the open, into public discourse, you create the public space.”
Ruya Gunergin ’18 said she identified with Wodiczko’s talk.
“As an international student from Turkey, I was able to resonate with what Krzysztof Wodiczko said about the importance of public space,” she said. “It truly facilitates communal discourse as well as being the backbone of democracy. I appreciate his work.”
During his presentation, Wodiczko described his previous public works in Germany, Poland, Montreal, and New York City. His 2008 projection on the Adam Mickiewicz monument in Warsaw, Poland, was his first piece using video to animate a statue.
The artist went on to discuss the technical difficulties of the John Harvard projection.“The projection mapping was a complicated negotiation with the statue’s body and the Harvard students,” he said.
Benedito referred to the empowering effects of Wodiczko’s work.
“Krzysztof is arming these people, in which speech becomes a weapon,” she said. “There is a constant presence of community in his work.”
The artist expressed a desire that his work would leave a lasting mark on the Harvard community.
“Once all of [the John Harvard projection] has been switched off, my hope is that it will still be there, an after-image,” he stated.

A candlelight vigil called “Take Back the Night” attracted a crowd of more than 50 people to stand together in support of the survivors of abuse and exploitation on Thursday.
“We want people to know that they are cared for and are not alone,” said Alyssa R. Leader ’15, a member of Response Peer Counseling. The event was organized by Response, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and Harvard CAARE.
Leader said she hopes people will “come together and embody the type of community that we hope to create and sustain for survivors of violence not just during Take Back The Night but every night.”
TBTN originated as a national movement in the 1970s and was recently brought to campuses around the nation in order to address and increase the dialogue about campus sexual violence, according to Leader. She emphasized the importance of TBTN in creating a non-judgmental, non-directive space for anyone wanting to discuss these issues.
“TBTN is a wonderful catalyst for what we hope will blossom into a much larger conversation on confronting rape culture and on generating sex-positivity” said Megan G. Jones ’16, a member of CAARE. Jones said CAARE hoped to empower, support, and respect those who spoke at the vigil.
Participants marched the perimeter of Harvard Yard holding candles during the event. Most of the walk was silent, though it was broken by regular stops during which participants read poems about thriving after enduring violence. The event concluded with a circle in front of Memorial Hall to hear letters written by anonymous survivors.
“It’s not about anger, tearing apart the perpetrators of the heinous crime that is rape,” said Cliff F. W. Goertemiller ’17, who attended the event. “It’s about empowerment and love, because that’s what will get the healing started.”
Harvard CAARE, Response, and OSAPR have planned another event in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, according to Jones. On April 29, the groups have organized “Harvard Wears Denim,” a daylong event on which Harvard affiliates can show their solidarity by wearing denim or posting pictures of themselves in denim to social media outlets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring has officially arrived in Cambridge and with the new season comes a multitude of venues for Harvard students to procrastinate on their end-of-semester assignments. Marathon Monday took place this week, proving that college students really can get out of bed before 9:00am, especially for a local holiday. For those more musically inclined, the 2015 edition of Yardfest takes place this weekend, featuring Jessie J, who is still somehow an upgrade over last year’s mediocre headliner. What was her name again? And, of course, the NHL and NBA playoffs are in full swing, and Major League Baseball just kicked off its season a few weeks ago.
As we get closer to closing the books on another semester, Harvard athletes are also finishing up the spring sports season, with most teams completing regular season play this weekend. With some free time on their hands as practices and p-sets come to an end, the Crimson’s best athletes took to Twitter this week to discuss everything from walruses to the Game of Thrones season premier.
Let’s count down this week’s best tweets from Harvard athletes.
6. Senior women’s squash player Amanda Sobhy, who sealed her fourth consecutive individual national title this past season, gave the Twitterverse a sneak peek into how she stays on top of her game.
“That moment after leg day when you are trying to walk and it looks like you just crapped your pants #currentstatus #waddlewaddle”
Maybe more college squash players should take up your leg routine, Amanda. They’d be waddling their way to a national title in no time.
5. Senior forward of the men’s basketball team and longtime “Tweets of the Week” contributor Jonah Travis took to Twitter to vent his frustration with Harvard transportation.
“Tired of the shuttle making me late for class”
I’m sure your professors are tired of it too. #quadlife
4. Women’s hockey freshman forward Karly Heffernan had no fear in tweeting something we all think, but don’t have the courage to say.
“After you watch Nicholas Sparks movies you instantly want a boyfriend. You can’t deny it.”
That’s weird. When I watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, I instantly want to stop watching a Nicholas Sparks movie. I can’t deny it.
3. Senior men’s basketball wing Wesley Saunders couldn’t wait to get back to HBO’s most popular show ever.
“Game of Throneeeees”
2. Freshman football tight end Alec Coyle-Nicolas shared Saunders’ excitement.
“Been saving up my free time for months for this one hour #WinterIsComing”
I think a prayer to the old gods and the new couldn’t hurt come exam season.
1. Grant Solomon, a freshman on the men’s tennis team, earned the top spot with some of the more insightful tweets of the week.
“If you think about it, glasses are really useful if you can’t see. But then, what good are glasses?”
“Unanswered questions: would you rather sleep with a walrus or have everyone think you slept with a walrus?”
“Things I ask myself: if the grass is greener on the other side, the soil on this side is useful for growing pumpkins #commonknowledge”
Luckily for you, Grant, Harvard offers a concentration in Philosophy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the smoothest of days, when cars sail up I-93 North beneath a cloudless sky, it takes about 40 minutes to travel from the black gates of Harvard University to the red wooden sign that demarcates the Harvard Polo and Equestrian Center.
Beyond the sign, there are fields. Beyond the fields, there is a stable, filled with 29 stalls.
Four days a week, the Harvard Polo Club makes this trek from the loud urbanity of Cambridge proper to the relatively sleepy suburbanity of South Hamilton, Mass. From crowds to open space: even at its namesake home, the Harvard Polo Club remains hidden from the casual view.
This lack of recognition belies one of the most incredible backstories of any sport at Harvard, which is no small claim. Boasting a nation-leading 42 varsity sports, Harvard has witnessed an impressive amount of athletic history, ranging from the first instance of intercollegiate competition to the invention of the catcher’s mask and the forward pass.
Still, the basic narrative of Harvard Polo—why it exists, how it operates, and what it stands for—is too unusual and often too bizarre not to stand out from the pack.
It is a story about Tommy Lee Jones ’69, the Hollywood actor and leading Harvard Polo benefactor, who discovered polo and fame at roughly the same time. It is a story about a family of polo lovers: five sons overall, three professional players, and one father-guru who currently coaches Harvard’s team.
The story involves training in Texas and competition in China, lifelong cowboys and trained jumpers, torn jeans and white britches. But most simply, Harvard Polo is the collective tale of the roughly 30 students who participate in the program.
Some of these players commit up to six hours a day, four days a week, but in return, they receive an athletic experience quite unlike anything else that Harvard has to offer.
BACK IN FAVOR
When the Harvard Polo Team was founded in 1883, it was the first collegiate program in the country. Newly imported from England, the sport meshed well with the affluence of the student body and blossomed in the 1920s.
As polo fell out of favor across the country, however, it also fell out of favor at Harvard. For several decades, Harvard Polo had an unstable existence, intermittently folding and restarting depending on the commitment level of interested players.
This past decade has provided some stability, largely thanks to a steady stream of financial backing from Jones and others. The team has purchased the Harvard Polo and Equestrian Center and expanded to include men’s, women’s, and junior-varsity teams.
United by a love of horses, Harvard’s players hail from a diversity of geographical backgrounds and boast varying levels of polo experience.
Men’s captain Neil Purdy occupies one extreme of ability. Purdy grew up in Minnesota, “on the line where it turns from suburban homes to cornfields,” and about a quarter of a mile down the road from the Twin City Polo Club. Along with a group of friends, Purdy hung around the club for hours at a time, and the current sophomore recalls learning how to wield a mallet through trial and error.
By the time he applied to college, polo had assumed such a large role in his life that he made sure to investigate the programs of different schools.
“When I came to Harvard, I knew polo was something I wanted to do,” Purdy said. “I was really happy that they had a polo program and that I could join it when I got in as a freshman.”
But the polo team has been a draw even for those without prior experience.
Freshman Luke Murnane grew up around Choteau, Mont., population less than 2,000. Although he came from a rodeo background, he had never played polo prior to his arrival in Cambridge.
“Since Harvard didn’t have a rodeo team, I thought that this was the next best thing,” he said. “That was one of the key things that led me to come here—the fact that I was able to get out, ride horses, and connect with something that’s been a big part of my life.”
Not everyone has the riding experience that Purdy and Murnane do, but familiarity with horses is not a prerequisite for involvement.
Team sports often pave the way into the world of polo. Many current members of the team played soccer, lacrosse, or hockey in high school, which women’s captain Aemilia Phillips, an inactive Crimson editor, cites as a significant benefit.
“People are drawn to the combination of horse sports and the team aspect of it,” said Phillips, who is a former soccer player. “Having athletic experience...is a huge plus for joining the team. People tend to pick [polo] up faster and are better with the hand-eye coordination required by a mallet.”
The embrace of multi-sport athletes alongside lifelong polo enthusiasts has aided the growth of the club and, to a certain degree, ensured the future stability of the program.  But just a decade ago, that future did not exist. Neither, for that matter, did the Harvard Polo Club.
KEEPING UP WITH JONES
In some ways, the creation story of Harvard Polo took place several decades ago, in a dusty ranch community just outside of Hollywood.
The creator? Tommy Lee Jones ’69.
“He certainly was instrumental,” Harvard coach Crocker Snow ’61 said. “Harvard is very important to him, and polo and horses are very important to him.”
But years before involving himself with the team, Jones was just a recent Harvard graduate trying to make it big in Hollywood.
In those early days, Jones, who grew up riding horses in San Saba, Texas, earned additional income by working as a ranch hand. It was during this period that Jones first encountered polo.
At Harvard, Jones played varsity football, competing in the famous 1968 Harvard-Yale contest that ended in a 29-29 tie, but polo captured his imagination and soon became a constant passion.
Mallet by mallet, horse by horse, and then ranch by ranch, Jones moved progressively deeper into the world of the sport. To this day, the right conditions can coax Jones into a friendly contest, often alongside his wife, Dawn, who boasts a professional ranking in the sport.
Midway through the 2000s, Jones found a way to integrate his appreciation of Harvard and polo into a new project: the Harvard Polo Club.
“One-hundred percent, it would not have been financially possible without Tommy Lee Jones,” Purdy said. “Not just his finances. Once he heard this renewal was underway, he was fully onboard and wanted to help out however he could.”
Jones’s commitment has remained steady over the years as the actor buys ponies for the program, funds financial aid, and even hosts the team on regular visits to his ranches in Texas and Argentina.
On these occasions, team players have a chance to hobnob with a celebrity over casual meals, but at least according to Crocker, the charge of meeting someone famous fades fairly quickly.
“I think [Jones] enjoys our dinners,” Crocker said. “He doesn’t think that Harvard students or undergrads or faculty would be star-struck in general…. Their parents are probably more star-struck than they are.”
A FAMILY LEGACY
If Jones forms one half of the soul of the Harvard Polo Club, then the Snow family, Crocker included, constitutes the other.
The group’s involvement with polo stretches back decades before Jones had even picked up a mallet. Crocker’s father played, Crocker played, and now Crocker’s sons play, creating a multi-generational chain that spans much of the past century and is intricately connected to the Harvard Polo narrative.
“The simple answer is yes, we’ve got a lot of connections with the game of polo,” Snow said.
The more complicated answer has to do with a Harvard hockey player who, for some reason, got extra kicks out of riding a horse.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Crocker Snow competed on the varsity ice hockey team but also pursued a semi-secretive passion for polo.
When Crocker arrived on campus, he discovered a group of experienced polo players that travelled from college to college, bartering games whenever possible.
Crocker got his start during the summer, but play soon spilled over into the school year, which meant integrating his newfound passion into a demanding hockey schedule. The balance was not always simple, and Crocker occasionally had to hide his polo commitment while in-season for hockey.
“I did it once or twice on the sly,” Crocker said. “We were playing down at Yale, and I snuck out afterwards to play polo against Yale. It was sort of ad hoc.”
Crocker graduated from the College in 1961, but his polo obsession persisted. Despite taking on a time-consuming journalism career, Crocker made room for polo matches every once in a while.
This lifestyle meant that when Snow raised his five sons, the kids grew up not only on a small farm just north of Boston but also in a polo-rich environment.
Two generations removed from his introduction to polo at Harvard, Crocker now stands atop a formidable lineage of polo players—a family tree that includes some of the brightest lights on the American stage in the past 25 years.
Adam, the eldest son, reached the highest levels of excellence in the sport. After starring at Yale as a hockey captain and lacrosse player, he took the world of polo by storm, becoming a 10-goal player, the highest rank in the sport. He was the last American to achieve this feat.
Crocker’s next son, Andrew, followed a similar path: college ice hockey and lacrosse at Middlebury and then a professional polo career, culminating in a six-goal ranking.
For the purposes of Harvard Polo, however, the most important of the Snow brothers was the second-youngest. As a sophomore at Harvard, Nick Snow ’09 dropped his spot on the varsity hockey team in order to focus on reviving the polo program at the college.
Crocker and Nick teamed up to bring back the program, with the elder Snow providing coaching and administrative support.
Looking back, Crocker does not remember whether he contacted Jones first or vice versa, but once finalized, this connection proved essential for the program.
Jones purchased a trio of horses within a couple of years, the Athletic Department pitched in some grant money, and the Harvard Polo Club rose out of the past once more, this time manned by a unique father-son combination.
“Harvard Polo would not exist without [Crocker],” Phillips said. “He knows the game better than anyone, but he’ll give it to you straight.”
Crocker still controls the reins, bringing a unique quality—players call it “charisma”—to each session. In tense moments on the sideline, he stamps his feet and sometimes curses. Team members know him as “Crocker;” they only use “Coach” in a kidding, half-satirical sort of way.
“He’s a character,” Purdy said. “He’ll let you know that you played terribly, but then he’ll make some funny comment.”
A DIRTY JOB
A Hollywood darling and a Hollywood-esque family of professional polo players might seem like an appropriately glamorous origin for a sport such as polo.
In some ways, this perception of the sport as a luxurious activity hits the mark. Brand names including Ralph Lauren and Ferrari have emphasized the high-class appeal of polo, and such advertising images dovetail with the reality of certain white britches, champagne celebrations, and professional-caliber competitions.
Yet members of Harvard Polo report a wildly different experience.
“Most people that know little or nothing about polo think about it as a very elite sport,” Crocker said. “That is part of the image that polo has marketed, so it’s not surprising that people think that. But that is not the reality of the sport, and it is absolutely not the reality of college polo.”
Each practice, for example, team members spend more time doing horse-related chores than actually playing polo. They currycomb hair; they pick hooves and adjust saddles.
And then there is mucking—that gloriously onomatopoeic activity that involves pitchforks, wheelbarrows, and lots of horse poop. Depending on the number of helpers, mucking can take between an hour or two every day.
These tasks are not luxurious—not by any stretch of the imagination—but after enough familiarity, neither are they worthless.
“You can’t shovel poop with people without getting really close to them,” Phillips said. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
If players are covered with dirt off the field, then they are covered with sweat on it.
As a multi-sport athlete in high school, Purdy has a special ability to judge the intensity of polo against other activities. But rather than downplaying the difficulty of the sport, Purdy’s athletic background has led him to emphasize the challenges of swinging a mallet on horseback.
“It can be one of the most tiring physical experiences that I’ve found, way more so than playing a full game of lacrosse or running for 90 minutes in a soccer game,” Purdy said.
A SPORT WITH PRIVILEGES
As messy and exhausting as Harvard Polo can be at times, playing on the team does confer certain privileges.
For more common sports, such as baseball and basketball, pre-collegiate participation on travel teams can carry the chance to travel across the country to play, but the worldwide popularity of polo means an opportunity to compete internationally.
Last summer, the team flew to Tianjin, China to represent Harvard at the Metropolitan Intervarsity Polo Tournament.
Sponsored by the Tianjin Golden Metropolitan Polo Club, the event was intended to raise awareness of polo, both in China and worldwide. Along with Harvard, teams from schools such as Stanford, Yale, Cambridge, and Oxford came to compete in the all-expenses-paid tournament.
“Being able to play twice a day for 10 days straight makes a huge difference,” Phillips said. “It’s a really great opportunity.”
But the most consistent benefit of team participation relates to Jones’s largesse as the actor hosts the team on near-annual trips to his ranches in San Saba, Texas, and Lobos, Argentina. The players provide their own airfare, but the actor foots other expenses.
Usually lasting about 10 days, the trips provide some opportunity for relaxation. Last time in San Saba, players hiked across the empty landscape; in Lobos, players took a day off to explore Buenos Aires.
But make no mistake, the trips are not vacations. The team rises early to care for the horses, plays through two-a-day practices, and labors under the guidance of an on-site professional coach.
“Every morning in Argentina, we’d be waking up, looking at what’s wrong with our bodies,” Phillips recalls. “It’s kind of a mutual strength thing where you know that everyone else is hurting [too].”
In the end, even these so-called privileges can boil down to more hard work.
ON THE RISE
The intensity of these training sessions has not stymied student interest in the program as Harvard Polo has experienced modest increases in popularity over the past several years. Purdy estimates that at the fall activities fair, 80 people signed up, 40 showed up for tryouts, and 20 eventually made the cut.
“I think the team is growing in recognition,” Phillips said. “I think more people are familiar with it now than even three years ago.”
Growing interest presents a novel sort of problem, as the team can only take as many players as there are available horses. Beyond resource difficulties, the revived program remains young, which puts Harvard at a recruiting disadvantage to top competitors like Cornell, Virginia, and Texas A&M.
Still, members of Harvard Polo laud the experience of team participation. For Purdy, polo continues to function as a “great escape” from daily concerns; for Phillips, the sport has been the “best part” of her undergraduate experience.
And for Crocker, who is nearing six decades of involvement with the Harvard program, polo has maintained that blood-rushing, adrenaline-pumping quality that first invigorated him as a college student, when he snuck out of a hockey rink in pursuit of a polo match.
“Polo is a very narcotic sport,” Crocker said. “If you like competitive sports, if you like contact sports, and if you like animals, there’s nothing that gets close to it. Once you’ve played a little...then chances are you’re going to get hooked.”
