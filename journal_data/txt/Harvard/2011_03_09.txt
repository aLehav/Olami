Can for-profit businesses promote social good?
Our generation’s tremendous enthusiasm for merging enterprise and social impact suggests that the answer is a resounding “yes.” The success stories are many, from the archetypal microfinance programs offering small loans to poor populations to businesses like HelloRewind, which gives former sex trafficking survivors employment in making recycled laptop sleeves.
Despite these successes, some people argue that doing business is fundamentally incompatible with doing good. In a 2005 article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Deborah Doane claimed just that, asserting that business objectives and social outcomes simply cannot align. In the long term, she argues, the ultimate need to bring in profits will always trump social objectives. While Doane’s view is extreme, the widespread criticism of corporate social responsibility--companies’ efforts to do social good--suggests it can be tough for existing for-profit businesses to make a real social impact.
CSR is often “largely nonsense,” according to a quote from consultant Gaurav Gupta in the New York Times. Gupta’s opinion is a fairly common one. While CSR has become increasingly popular among corporations in the past decade, it is widely criticized for placing an emphasis on improving a company’s public image and for the routine failure of CSR initiatives to make a real difference. In fact, The Economist has argued that CSR “can be positively harmful.” Even when it is not, CSR is often nebulously defined and sometimes consists of little more than philanthropic donations and companies’ efforts to protect their reputations. In a 2006 article in the Harvard Business Review, Michael Porter and Mark Kramer pointed out that many companies’ CSR programs are “uncoordinated initiatives to demonstrate a company’s social sensitivity.” Problematically, these initiatives are not always aligned with overall corporate strategy. For instance, the same article in The Economist pointed out that Toyota promoted environmental sustainability with its launch of the Prius but lobbied against the creation of tougher fuel-economy standards in the United States.
All of this underscores the difficulties of aligning business objectives with social outcomes. But doing so is not impossible. Indeed, when done well, using business for social good can not only help communities but also bolster companies’ competitive advantage, as Porter and Kramer have noted. In their Jan. 2011 article in the Harvard Business Review, they asserted that “[b]usinesses acting as businesses, not as charitable donors, are the most powerful force for addressing the pressing issues we face.”
A recent initiative being pioneered by PepsiCo, Inc. supports this view. In the past three years, Pepsi has begun buying corn directly from small farmers in Mexico, providing much-needed employment in poor communities in the developing world. Indeed, Mexican corn farmers have faced economic troubles since the adoption of NAFTA, when the Mexican government stopped subsidizing corn production and Mexican markets were flooded with corn from the United States. This depressed the price of corn, hurting Mexican farmers’ ability to subsist off corn sales and exacerbating issues like poverty and immigration to the United States. Pepsi’s new partnership with these small farmers, which has resulted in substantial increases in the farmers’ incomes, is contributing to alleviating poverty, decreasing immigration, and perhaps reducing marijuana production.
Moreover, the deal is highly advantageous for Pepsi’s business strategy. Pepsi no longer has to pay transportation costs to ship corn from the United States to their local factories, which are located near the Mexican farms Pepsi is now buying from. The company has also gained access to corn better suited to their products. Through this project, the corporation is improving its business and simultaneously promoting social good in a way that is distinct from the oft-criticized work of typical CSR initiatives.
Other businesses have also found unique ways to align social impact and profit-making. Philips Electronics has created cheap solar-powered lighting products being sold in Africa to people otherwise lacking access to electricity. Through its “Hairdressers Against AIDS” initiative, L’Oréal is leveraging its networks with hair salons in 24 countries to help hairdressers raise awareness and educate customers about how to prevent the spread of AIDS. These types of initiatives, in which businesses tackle social issues related to their corporate interests, reaffirm the potential for corporations to help build a better society. Perhaps, then, businesses really can do good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Thursday morning, the contents of a single envelope will drastically shape the following three years for Harvard freshmen. Leading up to housing day, most have an idea about which house or houses they want to get into. Some will be mindful of location, others about a house’s particular spirit, and others simply about the quality of the rooms. Housing Day morning can be either an extremely joyous or disheartening event, but in the hours that follow, a strange pattern unfolds. By the end of the day, or at least when freshmen return from spring break, the housing lottery’s random computer has succeeded, and most students are generally satisfied with their placement.
What happened?
It seems like the rowers who wanted to be close to Weld Boathouse are now pleased with Cabot, and the boys from Mower who really wanted to live in Mather are now ecstatic about moving into Quincy. Each blocking group in its own way comes to terms with its placement regardless of whether the assignment was its first choice, but often the rationalization process goes even further.
Clearly, it is a good skill to see the positive in a situation when you are given no alternative, and it is natural to emphasize the perks of your new house. But the more interesting case of reasoning is students “realizing” that their initial preferences for residence were skewed all along.
As reflective seniors, students often say that they cannot imagine having lived in any other house, and given the chance to do things over they would not switch to the house they had thought they wanted. However, this line of thinking can be worrisome. At the core of this reappraisal of one’s earlier thoughts lies the fear of going through a phase of life that is not ideal. For many Harvard students, life has largely gone according to plan, and every desired grade, trophy, and scholarship has been attained. Not getting into the house of your dreams complicates this plan, and so rather than dealing with that divergence, making that house the top choice realigns students with their identity as goal-seekers and goal-achievers.
The danger of avoiding sub-optimal situations does not just force self-contradiction, but it fundamentally prevents an accurate assessment of current situations. This problem does not just come to bear itself at Harvard, or during college in general, but can easily pervade the rest of adult life. When in the job hunt, we may be unable to recognize that sometimes we have not been admitted to our top choice, and accept that setback with an understanding that can help us act in the future.
Every house at Harvard is a fantastic place to spend three years, but clearly there are pros and cons of each one. Enjoyment of the residential experience necessitates highlighting the pros you have been sorted to enjoy, but avoiding any consideration that another house might have actually been better is intentional and unhealthy ignorance. Our lives will provide us with many exciting experiences, but we should not fear an accurate and objective reflection on how our given path compares to others we might have taken.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, I chose to relocate my family from Cambridge, Mass. to Cairo rather than to Beirut mainly due to its stability. Ironically, I began writing these words as we evacuated Cairo’s upheaval. During my short stay in Egypt, I have born witness to the first instance of a “genetic mutation” inspired by social media. Fear has dominated “the Arab genome,” a metaphor I used in a class I taught this past year to stress the depth to which the oppression of governments had become a personal, rather than cultural, facet of Arab life. This fear gave way to a thirst for freedom within a span of an hour on Friday, Jan. 28th. I observed the early seeds of this transformation right in my own classroom.
In the second week of January, I started a lecture at the American University in Cairo on the history of the Middle East’s economic development with the provocative title: “Freedom: The Missing Arab Gene?” We were discussing The Economist’s 2010 Democracy Index, which ranked Egypt at number 138 overall. The remainder of the Arab world fared equally miserably. “This all will change on Jan. 25th,” Omar, one of my students, challenged me. He shared with the class a Facebook page that called for popular protests on that day to demand basic freedoms, democracy, and social justice. “We will mutate the Arab genome on that day,” he boldly stated. I enjoyed his and his fellow students’ naïve optimism and pitied their inevitable disappointment. Within a few days, that page had a million followers.
I stood corrected on Jan. 25th, one of the happiest days of my life.
Social media enabled large masses to coordinate their action. In doing so, it broke the government’s monopoly on orchestrating the actions of large groups of people. In the context of the Arab world’s infamous mukhabarat—its internal secret intelligence services—this shattered its ability to crush opposition swiftly. I witnessed the pathetic attempts of Egypt’s ruthless security forces to crush the endless flood of protesters only to fuel them in the end.
The Egyptian regime responded to people’s demands for freedom in the only way it knew how—trying to terrify its own people. Within the span of half an hour on the evening of Jan. 28th, not a single policeman could be seen on the streets of Cairo. In a city of 20 million people, this means chaos. This was further exacerbated as regime-backed thugs looted and terrorized people, and the regime facilitated a mass escape from prisons. As my family returned home after scrambling to get some food and finding an ATM that had not yet been depleted, we found our female neighbors screaming and our male ones gathering weapons. They were fearful of fast approaching thugs whom they were told had looted and raped nearby communities. An old neighbor walked up to me, and in his shaking hand he held a pistol. He handed me a rusty sword to defend my family and neighborhood. I stayed up with the neighbors till daybreak wielding my car’s steering-wheel club to prevent outsiders from entering our neighborhood. Similar groups sprung up throughout the community, with mosque minaret calls providing reinforcements for any group coming under attack.
We had to stand for hours to get few loaves of bread. Supermarket shelves were emptied, gas stations closed, Internet shut down, TV news media scrambled, cell phone communications blocked, curfews enforced, but nothing stopped the people’s march for freedom. As I came back to Egypt right after Mubarak’s removal, I found myself in a new Egypt, one where ordinary citizens take it upon themselves to clean the streets and paint public property. I even saw Egyptian soldiers share their meager food rations with street kids. On Feb. 18, I joined millions of Egyptians in Tahrir   Square as they celebrated not merely the removal of a dictator but the newfound and almost palpable sense of freedom, pride, empowerment and hope that engulfed the country.
I did not hear a single protestor shout against America or Israel; they shouted for their right to self-determination. This transformation is 100 percent Arab, absent of foreign instigation and, sadly, tangible support. As the rest of the Arab world erupts in yearning for freedom, America’s best foreign policy now is to be on its side, on the right side of freedom and history rather than the dark side of despotism. The current U.S. stand is nothing short of a total lack of effective and long-sighted foreign policy. The U.S. should not alienate millions of young Arabs who believed in President Obama’s global cry of “Yes, we can!” The idea that the U.S. must choose between stability or democracy in the Middle East is inherently fallacious. After all, al-Qaeda and extremism were not prevented by Arab dictatorships—it fed off of them.
My wife and I relocated to the region in a large part to expose our two children to their Arab and Islamic cultural heritage in a resigned recognition that their destiny lies outside its stagnant and despotic realm.  This revolution might, happily, prove me wrong yet again.

On the eve of Housing Day, the College is abuzz with House spirit—but largely in the form of buzzing smartphones as students receive videos and emails advertising the superiority of each House over all the others. This speaks to the nature of community at Harvard; on a campus of busy people, we often socialize more over our virtual social network than our real ones.
But during these anxious days for freshmen and House communities alike, emails with content directed specifically at the recipient are exciting to say the least, and almost refreshing among the stock-brand event spam that crowds email lists during the rest of the year. Open email lists have been regrettably diverted away from their use as a community forum due to the inundation of event notifications which often translate to recipients as self-promotion rather than personal invitations. Although event spam may seem innocuous, its presence on our House email lists indicates a larger problem with the way undergraduates treat their House communities over the course of the year. Students should bring the positive spirit of Housing Day past Mar. 10 by respecting and dedicating themselves to using House email lists as community-building forums rather than as publicity platforms.
Houses are an excellent structural conduit for community-building across academic and extra-curricular interests. They unite a random selection of students who may have nothing in common besides their shared House identity. As we have said before, the House system is the best social tool the College has in fostering the healthy sense of community that is lacking from campus culture. Moreover, an important facet of this culture is the open email list, which ideally serves as a house-wide forum for discussion, advice, and debate. At this point, however, many open email lists are used for one-way publicizing rather than for dialectical and personal communication. How many students categorically delete, digest, or sort House emails into a separate category rather than carefully reading and processing each email as it comes out? The entire credibility of open email lists as a dynamic and reciprocal forum should not be undermined because of the promotional tendencies of its constituents.
In one sense, the problem finds its root in the decentralized nature of events notification on campus. While Harvard has the Gazette Events Calendar and the CS50 events calendar, event spam on email lists still thrives, suggesting that students appreciate email reminders above all else—a strong hypothesis in the age of smartphones. Why does Harvard not have a centralized notification system like Brown’s Morning Mail service, which sends out a list of all the happenings on campus in one daily email? The service is optional and can be pared down by the recipient to his or her desired group affiliation, such as year or academic interest, rather than CS50’s designation of whether the event has “Free Food” or not. Institutionalizing such a service would help reduce the stress level of students by simplifying their inboxes and helping them calmly approach which events seem of interest to them. An events calendar that is universal, unified, and regular will free up virtual social space for the more important task of building interpersonal ties.
But in another sense, the problem lies with the attitude students have toward their Houses. Viewing House open lists as a publicity forum reflects the deplorable mentality that one’s fellow undergraduates are each an opportunity for one more filled chair at a lecture or seminar, rather than for a new friendship. We should value our local communities more and see past the day-to-day game of making our individual events successful. In this vein, while enforcing any severe restriction on events spam on email lists would be difficult if not impossible, it is up to every student to help reduce this phenomenon both by sending out fewer event notifications and by contributing to productive discussions on open email lists.
Although it may seem silly to take the role of email so seriously, the reality is that it plays an outsized role in our lives. Therefore, we must take just as much care in maintaining the healthy and constructive nature of our virtual social networks as we do our real-life ones. The Houses have a great deal of potential to make the Harvard social experience a better one, but only if we invest in them—both in person and online.

After several years of planning, Lesley University received a special permit from the Cambridge Planning Board last week approving the relocation of the Art Institute of Boston from Kenmore Square in Boston to Cambridge’s Porter Square.
AIB, founded in 1912, merged with Lesley College to become part of the university in the late 1990s.
The zoning amendment was passed by the City Council this past June but required a special permit due to the scope of the construction project.
The zoning proposal includes moving the former North Prospect Church south of its parcel of land and creating a four story Arts Plaza on Mass Ave.
The church, built in 1845 and moved into its current location in 1867, was purchased by Lesley University in 2006 when the church’s congregation decided to merge with another in Medford. Since the church is currently designated as a historic landmark, its reconstruction required approval from the Cambridge Historical Commission.
The new facilities are intended to serve as art galleries, an art library, and a gathering space for artists.
Councilor Craig A. Kelley, the only councilor who voted against the zoning ordinance, said that this project is getting “active resistance from four or five people who are questioning whether the zoning is valid.”
According to Kelley, those against the move submitted an appeal to the court more than six months ago. If the appeal passes, Lesley University’s project could be terminated.
But according to Lesley University Public Affairs Director Bill Doncaster, the university has been having an ongoing community discussion to integrate Porter Square residents into the planning.
A committee of volunteer neighbors assembled by the Cambridge Community Development Department, named the Lesley/Neighborhood Working Group, has been meeting with Lesley administrators since 2006, according to Doncaster.
“Cambridge is a dense urban environment and finding a suitable facility for the college is a challenge,” Doncaster said.
For Lesley College student Jerimiah Bergstrom, the project’s budget was a significant concern.
“There’s already been instances before with Lesley being over-ambitious with their budget,” Bergstrom said, referring to other construction projects the university has had to delay, but ultimately completed.
Bergstorm, who has lived in Allston for the past four years, added that he has seen first-hand the negative effects of a university unable to fulfill its construction promises to a neighborhood—referring to Harvard’s halt on construction on the Science Complex in the neighborhood in 2009 due to financial constraints.
Bergstorm said he does not want Lesley to follow suit.
“Lesley has been in its own area for the past 100 years and the community has grown up with it,” Bergstorm said.

Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg encouraged young women to reconsider traditional perceptions of beauty at an event presented by Massachusetts General Hospital’s Harris Center for Education and Advocacy in Eating Disorders last night at the Business School’s Burden Auditorium.
Von Furstenberg—who rose to prominence in the fashion world after she designed an iconic wrap dress in the early 1970s—presented on the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day.
She spoke about the complex relationship between the world of high fashion and eating disorders, a topic that has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years.
Greeting the audience with a hearty “Happy International Women’s Day,” von Furstenberg discussed her personal history in the world of fashion and the inspiration that she gained from her mother, a woman who she said at one time weighed roughly 50 pounds not because of an eating disorder, but because of her forced imprisonment in Auschwitz during the Holocaust.
“I always say that the most important thing in life is the relationship that you have with yourself,” she said, recalling an important lesson she learned from her mother.
Von Furstenberg also spoke about the importance of celebrating womanhood in order to develop greater self-confidence among young girls.
Reflecting on the hardships she encountered while juggling family and a burgeoning career, she light-heartedly noted that “terrible moments become your best souvenirs—at least after they happen.”
In recent years, von Furstenberg, as president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has spoken out against the immense pressure to stay thin in the fashion industry.
Director of the Harris Center and Harvard Medical School Professor of Psychiatry David B. Herzog, whose research focuses on eating disorders, also spoke about the importance of “helping young models better meet the challenges they face” in their careers.
Commenting on the demand that models remain dangerously thin, Herzog added that “there is no simple cause and there is no simple solution.”
When asked about the media’s unrealistic portrayal of body image, von Furstenberg criticized modern reality television programming for pressuring women to maintain an unhealthily slim physique.
“There’s a worse obsession now. How about having fake tits? What kind of a role model is it to objectify women in such a way, on such shows like The Real Housewives?” she asked, to audience laughter.
Reminding her audience that the ideal of beauty is health, von Furstenberg implored those in attendance to reconsider how they view themselves and how they perceive others.
“Beauty is perfect in its imperfection,” she said.

The official deadline for professors to submit grades may be earlier next fall semester, according to Tengbo Li ’12, the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee chair.
Because many deadlines fell on or near Christmas in 2009, the submission deadline for last fall was set back to Jan. 3rd, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in a December e-mail to The Crimson.
But following last semester’s changed schedule, some students expressed concern that they had still not received some of their grades, even after the Jan. 3 deadline had passed.
In last Wednesday’s Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting, Harris proposed a return to the typical fall rolling grade deadline, according to which grades are due four days after final exams, CUE member Samuel F. Himel ’12 said.
“Students want their grades, and administrators want to take informed action after the break,” Himel said. “Harris hoped that returning to the old system would facilitate that.”
Regardless of whether Harris’ proposal for next fall is approved, the typical four-day rolling grade deadline will stay in effect for the current spring semester.
Since the fall semester ends just before Christmas, requiring course leaders to submit grades on or around Christmas has posed problems in the past.
But the proposed return to the traditional schedule, which is still subject to faculty review, is intended to reduce the number of outstanding grades, give the administration time to resolve grade anomalies, and provide students with advising resources as soon as possible in the spring semester, according to Himel.
Also a CUE member, Li said he thinks the proposed change would benefit students applying to graduate schools, internships, and jobs.
“For those students who have those early deadlines, it gives them an opportunity to send in transcripts that have the whole set of grades,” he said.
Li said he thinks that regardless of the date of the deadline, all students should receive their grades at the same time so that no students are unfairly disadvantaged by incomplete transcripts in their applications.
“The problem now is that some students get all their grades and some don’t,” he said. “If everyone’s on the same plane, that’s fine.”
Li added that he thinks an earlier grade submission deadline will help reduce the negative consequences of late grades.
“Having an earlier submission deadline allows for that human error,” he said. “If professors are turning grades in late, they won’t be as late as they would have been.”
Himel said he thinks an earlier grade deadline will make it easier for students to reflect on their grades.
“A grade is potentially a feedback tool,” he said. “If you get it as soon as possible, it has the most weight and you can reflect on it as meaningfully as possible.”
But Registrar Michael P. Burke said that the proposed deadline change may be difficult for professors.
“The most challenging burden in setting an earlier deadline falls on the faculty who would have less time to grade,” he said.
Burke said that the administration is working hard to address student concerns about timely grades.
“I understand the desire for students to have grades as early as possible and we’ll do what we can to meet that expectation,” he said.
Harris declined to comment on the proposed deadline change because it has not yet been presented to the Faculty.

College students across America “came out” as feminists yesterday, showing their support for women’s issues.
At Harvard, about forty students assembled in Ticknor Lounge to celebrate the second annual Feminist Coming Out Day last night.
The event coincided with International Women’s Day and was part of Harvard College Women’s Week 2011 “Stand Up and Stand Out” campaign.
Wearing shirts with the message “this is what a feminist looks like,” students participated in spoken word performances, poetry, and photography to urge people to rethink their notions of feminism and gender equality.
“A lot of times, saying you’re a feminist has such a negative connotation,” said Suzanna E. H. Bobadilla ’13. “We want to promote a positive meaning. We are not promoting that women are better than men. We’re just saying that we are equal. Some people are threatened by it.”
The event was a collaboration of the Radcliffe Union of Students, Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, and the Athena Program. It was part of a larger campaign that has spread nationwide to college campuses at Yale, Stanford, Wellesley and others.
“Too often, feminists are seen as only white, middle class, straight women,” said Abby P. Sun ’13, co-president of Radcliffe Union of Students. “We wanted to change that myth. We wanted to put a face to feminism.”
The Feminist Portrait Project was intended to do just that. Many college students across the nation changed their Facebook profile picture to photographs of themselves in a generic frame labeled “this is what a feminist looks like.”
“We are trying to fight stereotypes,” Daily Guerrero ’14 said at the event, “Our society often has negative notions of powerful women. Women in power are often called ‘bitches.’ We want to redefine this image and show that women can have authority and confidence.”
Many attendees voiced their frustration at the limited portrayal of women’s issues and feminism in general.
“[Feminism] is often stereotyped as an aggressively women-driven movement, but it’s all about equality,” Christopher J. Masterson ’14 said. “You don’t have to be a woman to be a feminist.”
The Harvard College Women’s center will continue to hold events relating to women’s issues throughout the week. A follow-up event, “Blogging and Activism in the Feminist Blogosphere,” will take place on Thursday.
“We would love to continue and make it larger than ever ... not just one day,” Sun said. “The fight for justice is never over.”

The burning of African-American churches by white supremacist groups may seem like an issue of the distant past, but a panel discussion at the Kennedy School of Government sought to raise awareness about the problem of church burning in contemporary society.
The discussion, called “The Fires This Time: Black Church Burnings in Contemporary America,” featured activists, scholars, and speakers whose communities had been affected by church burning.
One of the church burnings took place as recently as 2008 in Springfield, Mass. at the Macedonia Church of God in Christ, a predominantly African-American church led by Bishop Bryant Robinson Jr.
The church was allegedly burned by three young men just hours after President Obama had been elected, according to Robinson.
“Their affidavits revealed that they did it because Obama was elected President,” Robinson said.
National Coalition for Burned Churches Executive Director Executive Director Rev. Rose Johnson-Mackey said from 1995-1996, Ala. and Tenn. saw a wave of church burnings.
“Volunteer firefighters were allowing the churches to be burned to the ground,” Johnson-Mackey said.
But due to collective efforts by the communities affected and Harvard student activists, the response by local governments has grown much swifter in recent years, according to Robinson.
Johnson-Mackey also said that her organization’s involvement in these cases has helped to push the issue and put pressure on the state and federal government to acknowledge the urgency of these events.
To help encourage community leaders to work towards bringing the criminals to justice and to help rebuild the places of worship destroyed, Robinson and the other panelists started a volunteer team about a decade ago that includes many current Harvard students and alumni.
Among the crowd of at least 20 student volunteers present at the discussion, Joseph B. Gaspard ’12 was one of the student leaders on a trip to towns affected by church burning.
“It’s one of those things where you love the work that you do but you hate the fact that you do have to do it,” Gaspard said.

Adding to the national dialogue on funding for women’s reproductive health care, speaker Andrea Miller argued at a “Women’s Week” event yesterday that a woman’s right to control her body transcends financial concerns.
Miller—Executive Director of NARAL: Pro-Choice Massachusetts—spoke to a packed Women’s Center about the economics of birth control.
“It’s terrific we’ve got dollars and cents arguments, but this is about how each of us navigates questions about sex and relationships and families,” Miller said.
Miller shared statistics on the benefits of federal funding for birth control resources, noting that for every dollar spent on family planning, Medicaid saves $3.74. In 2008, those savings summed to about $5.1 billion, she said.
But Miller broadened the scope of the discussion by posing a hypothetical assignment to attendees: how would you write a term paper about the cost-effectiveness of birth control?
The paper, she said, might touch on the three most “cost-effective” methods of contraception: intrauterine devices, birth control pills, and vasectomies. But economic efficiency alone cannot dictate which method is the best choice for a given individual, she said.
“What I thought would be more interesting would be to think and talk ... about what kinds of costs matter in our own lives,” Miller said.
The discussion then turned to tradeoffs and investments in the personal rather than economic sense.
“I think one of the most salient points she made was that what’s going on right now in the House of Representatives and in the public debate about reproductive health is fundamentally about whether women can control their lives and make their own choices,” Karen A. Narefsky ’11 said. Narefsky is co-director of Students for Choice, the organization that hosted the event.
Attendees Melissa V. Perez ’13 and Amanda J. Villani ’14 said that, among the discussions on health insurance and Planned Parenthood funding, they were especially struck by the statistics.
“When she told us that one in three women will have an abortion by the time she’s 45 and told us to look around the room, seeing the number of girls who hypothetically would have abortions was quite startling,” Villani said.
Miller said an average woman spends 5 years pregnant or trying to get pregnant, and about 30 trying not to get pregnant.
“I think it’s really important that women our age are thinking about their reproductive lives, access to birth control, and other parts of women’s health care,” said Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, another event planner. “At Harvard, we have so many resources, so it’s important that we advocate both for ourselves and for those who cannot advocate as effectively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard student startup ideas—including a program to track news articles written about friends and a website that helps student filmmakers to gain exposure—were on display last night in the Radcliffe Gymnasium as part of the Harvard College Innovation Challenge Showcase and Awards Reception.
This year’s challenge was the largest and most competitive in the event’s four year history. Eighty-four teams, composed of 222 participants from over 30 different concentrations, applied to the competition last semester, vying for the chance to win prizes ranging in value from $500 to $10,000.
Semifinalists, whose work was on display last night, were selected by a panel of businesspeople, investors, and innovators, many of whom are Harvard alumni.
The student entrepreneurs set up stations and enthusiastically shared their projects with attendees, who included members of the local business community. Many students arrived in coat and tie and handed out business cards and literature about their ventures.
The proposals were presented in various stages of development, with some students displaying posters and diagrams and others showing off fully functioning programs.
A number of teams, including the designers of pARTake—a website that allows musical groups at Harvard to communicate, offer ideas, and share their music—set up laptops to demonstrate their services.
Some of the ventures on display last night seek to connect people using innovative social networking features. Several speakers at the event attributed this piqued interest in social media to the recent release of “The Social Network,” which dramatizes the life of Facebook founder and former Harvard student Mark E. Zuckberberg.
For example, Newsle, the product of Jonah L. Varon ’13 and Axel R. Hansen ’13, allows users to follow their friends through news stories—rather than Facebook or Twitter feeds—by finding online articles or blog posts that mention them.
The application already has 4,000 users and is tracking news about more than 1.2 million people—friends, contacts, and public figures that the service’s users choose to follow.
Varon and Hansen were among the handful of entrepreneurs who won top awards last night, taking home a $10,000 grant along with recognition as the best commercial startup.
Another social venture, Nexus, won the Harvard Student Agency Prize. The site—created by a team of five sophomores and juniors—aims to connect students with alumni clubs and employers.
The hosts of the awards reception emphasized that, though the selection of winners may seem to conclude with yesterday’s competition, it represents only the beginning for many of these startups.
Varon and Hansen said they were thrilled to be recognized for their hard work.
Like many of the other teams, they said they plan to keep developing their project this summer, and hope that the award funding will help them as they look toward a full release of their program next fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The night before blocking forms were due, Graham M. Frankel ’12 and his soon-to-be blockmates suddenly realized that their potential blocking group included nine people­, one more than the maximum of eight.
In a “down-to-the-wire last-minute deal,” Frankel and his blocking group were forced to resolve the situation. Since Frankel wanted a single bedroom and didn’t have a natural roommate in the group, Frankel was left alone as the other eight blocked together. Frankel would link with their group but block as an individual—a form of blocking that has been dubbed “floating.”
Although linking guaranteed that his friends would be in the same neighborhood, Frankel entered Pforzheimer House alone. Two years later, he serves as co-chair of his House Committee and is friends “with over half the house,” he says.
There are a variety of reasons why people choose to pursue Frankel’s path and float.
Some, like Frankel, have too many people in their blocking group, forcing one individual to go it alone. Others failed to find their niche freshman year and want to use sophomore year to explore new social environments. Still others use floating as an opportunity to meet more people.
TO BLOCK OR NOT TO BLOCK
Every February, discussions in Annenberg Hall and freshman dormitories revolve around the creation of blocking groups. But fewer conversations center on the possible benefits of floating.
Kip C. Christianson ’13 says that by November, he already knew that he wanted to block individually.
He says that although he had offers from several blocking groups, he considered joining them for “all of five seconds” before choosing to stick with his decision to float. He says that he met many interesting people over the course of his freshman year, and he thought that floating would facilitate a repetition of that experience sophomore year.
“I knew that in my freshman year the people I had associated with had been generally similar to me,” Christianson says.
“The decision to float came from a desire to experience more of what Harvard had to offer,” he says.
Christopher A. Hopper ’13 says that like Christianson, he was excited by the opportunity to meet new people and therefore was not seriously concerned when he realized that his entryway mates in Stoughton North had already filled the blocking group he had intended to join.
Hopper says that although blocking might add some security to the Housing situation, he was ambivalent because he said he is “an adventurous person.”
Among those interviewed, most floaters described themselves as “adventurous” and as harboring a desire to broaden their network.
André B. Crutcher ’14, like Frankel, had a potential blocking group of nine people.
But he says, “I’m kind of in a rut. I feel like meeting more people.”
Crutcher says that in addition to deciding to float, next year he plans to take on more extracurricular activities in order to meet new people.
Frankel acknowledged that there is often a stigma attached to floating. Some say that floaters tend to lack a solid group of friends or have problems interacting in social situations.
But Frankel points to his own experience as proof that the situation differs from person to person.
“I’m very social, and I floated,” Frankel says.
THE STIGMA OF FLOATING?
Administrators agree with Frankel, saying that it is impossible to categorize all floaters as one particular type of person since there are many reasons why a person might choose to block individually.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 says that students have often approached him to discuss both the merits and disadvantages of floating.
According to Dingman, when a person is particularly concerned about the prospect of blocking alone, the Freshman Dean’s Office works hard to help them find a new roommate.
But sometimes, he says, students approach him with concerns about how floating will impact their social status.
“Some have simply wondered what it means about themselves in other people’s minds, and that, it seems to me, is unfortunate,” Dingman says.
He says that the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life have been working hard to try to remove some of the stress of the blocking process by asking all freshman proctors to meet with their entryways to discuss the lottery. Floating is among the issues that the proctors are supposed to raise with their entryways, Dingman says.
Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh says that he is “cautious” about making assumptions regarding people who float.
According to McIntosh, the Office of Student Life does not prefer some Houses over others when assigning Houses to one-person blocking groups.
“Despite popular belief and mythology to the contrary, the process of assigning students to Houses is completely random.” McIntosh says of the Housing lottery.
He says that House administrators, who are in charge of rooming, are made aware of the presence of one-person blocking groups when they receive a list of their House’s rising sophomores listed by blocking group.
Given the variety in the size of rooms available for sophomore Housing, it is up to the individual Houses to determine how to room floaters, according to McIntosh.
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 says that in Adams, floaters are not guaranteed singles, nor do they always ask to be housed alone. He says that the House tries to accommodate their wishes and make them feel comfortable in their new House.
“I think it would be unfortunate if you just had floater rooms that were singles where people would just come in and not know anybody,” Palfrey says. “It would be sad.”
FLOATING INTO BLISS
But that’s not the case.
Frankel describes his decision to float as “the best choice that I could have made.” He says that entering Pforzheimer without a set group of friends forced him to become closer with other members of his House.
Similarly, Christianson says that although he has maintained his friendships with the people he chose not to block with, he too has become closer with his House because of his decision to float.
He also says that he appreciates having a new roommate whom, until this year, he had never met.
“It’s really been an incredible experience,” Christianson says. “It’s an opportunity for growth.”
Christianson adds that he believes that he and his roommate may have been assigned their two-room double, which he describes as “one of the best rooms in the House,” partially because of his decision to float.
He spoke with the Winthrop House administrator, Joanna G. Miller, before entering the House, and advises that other incoming freshman floaters do the same.
“Try to give them as much information as you can because the House administrator really does contribute to your future,” Christianson says.
Floating might not be for everyone, but those who are considering it should not be discouraged from doing so, Hopper says.
“If you want security, you might want to block with someone. But just do it if you’re not afraid to meet new people and not afraid to take a risk,” Hopper says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Amanda N. Holm ’05, the soccer field that served as her backyard growing up was more than a playing field.
It was the location of various camp activities over the summer, home to her first business—where she would sell kool-aid to the athletes playing and practicing—and where some of her fondest memories had been formed.
That the soccer field was home to Ivy-League games and that her customers and counselors were Harvard students made no difference to her. She felt Harvard was another world she could not access—until she attended the University herself.
“I really was torn for awhile, it felt like I had to be two different people,” says Holm, who grew up in The Charlesview Apartments, a concrete cluster of low-income housing units located near Harvard Business School.
Raised in Lower Allston and attending Harvard, an institution that has long had a tense relationship with the community, Holm says there has developed a dissonance between loving her school and having a deep personal knowledge of the impact it has had on her neighborhood.
“I wasn’t aware of any tension of where I was—I loved it there,” says Holm. “It’s just coming now that maybe I should have felt differently about these things.”
FEW IN NUMBER
Over the past four years, nine Allston students have been admitted to the Classes of 2011-2014 with eight matriculating to Harvard, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. There are two members of the freshman class who grew up in Allston: Ada D. Lin ’14 and Samuel M. Wallis ’14, though neither they nor Holm attended high school in Allston.
Holm and Lin went to the Boston Latin School, while Wallis attended Buckingham, Browne, and Nichols, a private day school in Cambridge.
Although the neighborhood is located between Boston University and Harvard, and—according to Fitzsimmons—students in Cambridge and Boston are given geographic preference, Lower Allston has low college attendance rates.
Wallis says that one reason for the low numbers may be that high schools in Allston do not provide students with the same academic preparation as other competing high schools.
“It’s made me wonder: Was I admitted for academic caliber or am I a diversity number?” says Wallis.
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS
Attending Harvard, Holm says she has begun to relate with those students to whom she had once sold kool-aid at the edge of the University’s soccer field.
But Holm says that growing up in the Charlesview exposed her to situations completely foreign to those of most of her current peers.
“I’ve seen a lot of things and lived through a lot of things that others had not lived through,” she says.
Holm says she disliked growing up in Charlesview, a set of buildings that has been involved in a tenuous relationship with the University for several years. In 2007 a land swap agreement made between the University and the Charlesview board of directors was drawn up to allow Harvard to consolidate its land holdings in the neighborhood while providing residents with new housing and amenities.
“It was very self-contained and I had a lot of great friends but I saw a lot of things you don’t see normally when you’re that young,” says Holm. As a result of attempting to distance herself from the past, Holm says she views herself more as a “Boston kid” than an Allston resident.
But not all the Allston natives attending Harvard grew up personally experiencing the tensions between the neighborhood and their future alma mater.
Both Lin and Willis say they spent more time playing with kids in other neighborhoods.
Though both students had family members who attended community meetings, voicing opinions on the University’s expansion into the neighborhood, neither developed a strong, emotional attachment to what Lin calls “Allston culture.”
Lin says she identifies more as a Harvard student than an Allston resident.
Wallis and Lin say that attending schools in different neighborhoods presented them with a different set of circumstances, limiting their cultural connection to Allston.
“I feel guilty because I was going to private school in Cambridge, hanging with kids from the suburbs,” Wallis says.
A NEIGHBORHOOD IN FLUX
Lin and Wallis say they are worried about the University’s impact on the neighborhood, which they say has both many longtime residents and immigrant families.
“It’s a historic neighborhood. My worry is that they’re going to keep on expanding so that my side of the river ... won’t be as much of a neighborhood as it is a campus,” Lin says.
They recall when the full extent of Harvard’s expected presence in the neighborhood was revealed in 1997. It was then that Allston residents discovered that the University had secretly bought land in the neighborhood under a subsidiary of a different name, leading to community outrage.
Growing up, Lin and Wallis remember seeing the physical changes along Western Ave.—the Star Market turning into a Kmart, the warehouses becoming vacant—but they did not attribute these changes to Harvard specifically. To them, it was just the way things were.
Although admittedly unaware of the specific details of Harvard’s present proceedings with Allston, Lin and Wallis were aware of some of the community projects the University has engaged in over the past few years—such as building a miniature golf course, having a farmers’ market, and more recently developing plans to build an Innovation Lab and Library Park.
But the 2009 halt in construction on the $1 billion Science Complex—slated to be the first in a number of University building projects in the neighborhood—marked a change in relations between Harvard and Allston for Lin.
“You can’t promise a whole neighborhood of people an increase in jobs and living spaces if you’re not going to follow through,” Lin says of the University’s decision to stop construction due to financial constraints.
For Holm, reconciliation between her identity as a Harvard student and an Allston native came with distance and time.
“It wasn’t until after I graduated until I could put the two together,” Holm says. “I feel very positive about both parts of my identity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some members of the Class of 2014 say that they plan to take part in “River Run,” drunken festivities to take place on Housing Day eve tonight, despite the administration’s condemnation of the event.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 sent an e-mail to the freshman class last week denouncing River Run—a recent tradition on the eve of Housing Day during which freshmen move from House to House, drinking shots of alcohol at their favorite ones in the hopes of being placed in their preferred House the next day.
Some students also attempt to burn boats on the Charles River containing the names of Houses they either do or do not want.
In his e-mail, Dingman called the tradition “dangerous,” pointing out that boat burning is “a violation of local law.”
“If you build a boat, and attempt to launch it on the Charles River, you will be stopped by the police,” Dingman wrote.
He also condemned the consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol this evening.
According to Dingman, security guards, Harvard University Police, Cambridge Police, and Massachusetts State Police will be present tonight to enforce laws regarding underage drinking.
Most students said that they were undeterred by the administration’s threats.
“I’m taking shots at every House,” said one freshman in Annenberg.
Some students said they did not plan to participate in River Run because they had midterms the following day. Still others said they had never heard of the activity and therefore did not plan to attend.
Several students said that although they intend to take part in the drinking component of River Run, they do not plan to burn boats out of fear that such antics would draw the attention of the police.
“Traditions like this are fun,” said a freshman boy in Matthews. “If you kill it because of a few liabilities, it’ll crush school spirit.”
But Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh said that he did not define River Run as a “tradition,” as it began only four years ago with members of the Class of 2011.
It was not until 2008 that the boat-burning and house-hopping traditions associated with modern River Run emerged, and very few students participated in that year’s River Run festivities, McIntosh said.
But though River Run may be relatively new, Housing Day festivities have a more storied history.
The Crimson reported two years ago that William F. Abely ’99 and his blocking group were the first to perform a sacrificial ritual on the eve of Housing Day.
“I don’t know where the genesis for the idea came from but we ended up taking our plant from PBHA sale at the beginning of the year and brought it down to the Weeks foot bridge, doused it in Jack Daniels and lit it on fire and dumped it over the edge of the bridge and hoped for the river,” Abely told The Crimson in 2009.
The group ended up in a suite overlooking the river in Leverett House—their first choice.
The antics of the Class of 2012, which Dingman described in his e-mail as “extreme,” required the Cambridge Fire Department to respond to a possible fire at the Weld Boat House.
Members of HUPD and officers of the Cambridge and Massachusetts State Police forces were called.
“My observation from two years ago is that these activities were very unsafe for students,” McIntosh said.
Concerned over safety and liability issues, administrators last year banned River Run, implementing the same restrictions for Housing Day eve that are in effect tonight.
According to McIntosh, although some students still participated in illicit River Run activities, last year represented a great improvement.
“There certainly was a very dramatic shift from the year before that, when I feared that significant numbers of students were engaging in dangerous activities,” McIntosh said.
The Freshman Dean’s Office hopes that instead of drinking, students will attend “Fresh Fest,” an alternative event tonight in Annenberg organized by the First-Year Social Committee at the same time that River Run festivities could potentially occur.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s softball team boasts a special pair of co-captains this year: Ellen Macadam and Emily Henderson. Not only do they work well together on the field, they’ve also built a relationship as roommates for the past three years.
But together, the pair has not had as much success as they would have liked for their team. After finishing second, third, and second again in the Ivy League, the two are hoping to win a championship—this year more than ever.
“We’ve had so many great seasons and one not so great one. We’ve had a lot of disappointing endings,” Macadam reflects. “But I think it’s left us with a lot of drive and hunger to really make this season what we want it to be.”
What both want is for the team to come out on top and win an Ivy title. Furthermore, they hope to communicate this goal to the team, and it sounds like they certainly have.
“They’ve been pushing us so hard in the off-season, we can tell they really want [the championship],” junior pitcher Rachel Brown says.
It’s a twin thing
When Macadam and Henderson journeyed to Cambridge from Atlanta, Georgia, and San Jose, California, respectively, the pair clicked from the start.
“Even on our recruiting trip, we hung out with each other right away,” Henderson says. “It was automatic. I was very comfortable with Ellen right away, and I hope she was with me.”
Over the years the two have spent a lot of time together, both in season and out. They dine, study, practice, lift, and organize team-bonding activities together. They share a room in Winthrop and a love of comedian Brian Regan and cookies (Henderson is touted as the “best baker ever”).  The two are also known to show up at team meals unintentionally wearing the same outfit.
“Emily will leave for class, and we will be wearing the same thing by accident,” Macadam says, amused. “Everyone on the team laughs about it.”
“Happens all the time!” Henderson adds.
For new members of the team especially, it’s hard not to get the two seniors confused.
“A lot of girls on the team can say they have mixed up their names so many times,” Brown jokes.
Harvard Charmers
Individually, the two have had very successful careers in the Crimson uniform.
“Ellen and Emily are both very committed and disciplined players. Each has grown a lot in their four years here,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard remarks.
Henderson was named to the All-Ivy First Team her freshman year, when she set the Ancient Eight record for single-season steals. Her sophomore year, Henderson was tabbed for the All-Ivy Second Team.
Macadam earned a place on the All-Ivy Second Team her rookie season when she posted the highest batting averages, hits, runs, and doubles for the Crimson. In 2010, Macadam was named to the Louisville Slugger/NFCA Northeast Region First-Team and the All-Ivy League First Team.
“They’re great to work with. They’re on the same page in terms of their goals for the team,” Allard adds. “They compliment each other well.”
As co-captains, Macadam is a strong voice in the infield. She has a “focused intensity” about her, as Allard describes. Henderson, the leader from the outfield, has found her voice in the past few years, directing the team with persistence and a positive image.
“I sound ridiculous, but we really don’t see each other very often at practice,” Henderson says. “We kind of joke when we get back to the room and say, ‘So how was practice for you?’”
As natural leaders of the team, the two will have more responsibility as they try to lead the squad to its first Ivy title since 2007.
“I expect both of them to be sparks in the lineup. As captains we expect them to set a great tone and have good pull for the team,” Allard says.
“Ellen’s very vocal. She’ll be the first one to speak after we come in, and her speeches really fire us up,” Brown says. “Emily is the one to put her arm around you if you’re having a tough time. She makes sure everyone on the team is doing well.”
Teammates for life
On top of the fun they have as co-captains, the pair each describe a deeper passion for softball and the team.
“Softball’s really been everything to me here,” Macadam says. “The team is my family.”
“The team is like having 20 other sisters,” Henderson adds.
As they look forward to the season, the two mention another set of goals they have in common: to treasure every game as a team and leave the program better than when they arrived.
“For me personally, the friendships on the team are really the part that lasts,” Henderson remarks. “And [hopefully] we can make the program more competitive and improve it more than it already has.”
“Above anything else, [we want to be remembered] as great teammates and great friends to everyone on the team,” Macadam echoes. “Also, to have made an impact on the program.”
Their strong desire to be remembered has already left an impression on the rest of the squad, Brown emphasizes.
“We’re not going to let them leave without a ring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In each of the past two seasons, the Georgetown Hoyas have defeated the Harvard men’s lacrosse team by one goal.
But yesterday, the tides finally turned, and it was the Crimson (2-1) that emerged victorious by a single point, pulling out a 16-15 victory over No. 20 Georgetown (2-2) on a chilly day at Soldiers Field Stadium.
“It was a really hard-fought game,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “Both teams played their hearts out.”
The Hoyas started the scoring 1:55 into the contest, when junior midfielder Zack Angel cut across the middle and fired a shot over Crimson sophomore goalie Harry Krieger’s shoulder to put Georgetown ahead, 1-0. But Harvard would go on to dominate the rest of the quickly-paced period.
Junior Jeff Cohen responded 30 seconds later with a game-tying score. A half-minute after that, with a Crimson man-up opportunity winding down, co-captain Dean Gibbons and sophomore attackman Peter Schwartz passed the ball back-and-forth before Gibbons fired on net, beating Hoyas senior goalie Jack Davis to put Harvard ahead.
Just six seconds later, after Harvard won the ensuing faceoff, Gibbons took a pass from freshman Eric Slingerland and scored.
At 10:44, Georgetown attackman Rickey Mirabito came around the net from the right side and fired a groundball shot past Krieger to cut the lead to 3-2.
After taking a pass from junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan, Schwartz then picked up with his first goal of the contest from far out on the right side to put the Crimson up 4-2 with 8:24 remaining in the period. Three minutes later, sophomore Alex White took a cross-field pass from junior Terry White, and Alex White, cutting across the middle moving left, fired it past Davis on the run.
Hoya Stu Shannon was then able to take advantage of a Sam Steyer pushing penalty and beat Krieger for a man-up goal. With 3:24 left in the first period, after a long Harvard possession, Vaughan, moving towards the Hoyas’ net, hit Cohen right in front, and Cohen, diving low from the left, fired it in to put Harvard up 6-3.
The Crimson would tack on one more goal before the first period was up, when freshman midfielder Daniel Eipp came from behind the net to beat Davis with 1:30 to go.
“Both offenses played really well,” Wojcik said. “We had trouble at stretches stopping them, they had trouble at stretches stopping us.”
After the high-scoring opening quarter, both defenses came out much stronger in the second, with the first goal not coming until 11 minutes into the period. After Krieger made a big save on a shot attempt by Georgetown’s Travis Comeau, the goalie hit Schwartz, who went streaking down the sideline. Schwartz threw a cross-field pass to sophomore Jack Doyle, who put the ball past Davis after finding himself wide-open in front of the net.
But the Hoyas responded with four unanswered goals. Attackman Brian Casey came up the middle and scored unassisted despite a lot of contact at 2:43, and Mirabito added his second goal under a minute later.
With 54 seconds to play in the period, Mirabito came around the net and found teammate Davey Emala open in front, and Emala beat Krieger to make the score 8-6. Just 10 seconds later, Emala intercepted a Harvard pass attempt back to Krieger, and catching the goalie out of position, threw it past him to cut the Crimson lead to one heading into the half.
“In the second quarter we got a little stagnant,” Wojcik said. “We started holding the ball too much. At halftime we met, talked about some of the things we were going to adjust, and I think we came out and offensively moved the ball really well.”
Four minutes into the third, junior Mark Scalise streaked up the right side and sent a cross-field pass to Gibbons, who went low and beat Davis to put Harvard back up by two. Comeau responded with an unassisted goal on a fast break at 9:07, but Eipp struck right back with a score of his own to make it 10-8 Crimson.
At 5:20, Doyle came around his defender moving right and beat Davis unassisted to put Harvard up three, but Georgetown would fight back again.
Comeau beat Krieger high after a give-and-go with Mirabito under a minute later. With 3:43 remaining in the period, Hoyas midfielder Max Seligmann came around to the left and dished off a short forward pass to Emala, who was able to push it past Krieger despite a big hit from a Harvard defenseman. Emala hit the post on his next shot attempt, but was able to pick up the bounce-back of his own rebound and fire it home, tying the game at 11 with 51 seconds to go in the third.
The Crimson retook the lead 3:25 into the fourth. Senior attack Matt Hull came down the end line and passed off to Alex White, who hit Cohen in front of the net for the goal. Thirty-two seconds later, Gibbons came around from the right, spun, and fired over Davis’ right shoulder to give Harvard a two-score lead.
Angle responded for Georgetown at 10:04 after spinning and beating Krieger high from the left. But Cohen would find Vaughan cutting from the right side behind the net, and Vaughan would score to put the Crimson ahead 14-12 with 6:16 remaining in the contest.
After a Davis body save two minutes later, Alex White picked up the rebound and put it back in to make it 15-12. Shortly thereafter, Eipp came around the net on the left side and found freshman Eric Slingerland wide-open on the right, who scored with little effort.
“Sixteen goals is great against anyone, but especially against Georgetown,” Cohen said. “Their defense was flying around. This is something we’re really proud of.”
The Hoyas would not go quietly, as Emala, Dan McKinney, and Casey added scores to cut the lead to 16-15 with seven seconds to go. But in the ensuing faceoff after Casey’s goal, Georgetown couldn’t handle a groundball, and Harvard held on for the victory.
Gibbons led the Crimson with four scores, while Cohen added three, and Eipp and Doyle had two. Emala had five goals to pace the Hoyas. Harvard outshot Georgetown, 47-40, but the Hoyas won 21 of 33 faceoffs, had four fewer turnovers, and owned a 33-32 advantage in groundballs.
“Today was obviously a huge win,” Cohen said. “The last two years they got us by one down at their place. It was nice to get a little bit of revenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With nothing more than pride on the line for the women’s basketball team, Harvard (18-10, 10-4 Ivy) closed out the season with a 62-55 win over Dartmouth (7-21, 3-11) last night in Hanover, N.H.
Coming off a tough loss on Saturday against Princeton that extinguished the Crimson’s postseason hopes, Harvard’s senior class, led by Emma Markley, delivered one last performance in a crimson and white uniform. Markley had a strong showing, scoring 13 points and adding eight boards as well as a block.
But it was youth that helped the Crimson get out of its first-half slump against the Big Green. The leading scorer for the visiting team was rookie guard Christine Clark, who had 19 points—17 of which came in the second half.
“[Clark] had a great game,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “She’s always working hard and has been very clutch for us throughout the year, so what she did tonight is nothing new.”
Harvard won the previous matchup between the two teams, 82-49, at Lavietes Pavilion and looked to dominate once again at Leede Arena.
But the game began poorly for the Crimson, who came in shooting 44.5 percent from the field during the season but shot only 25 percent during the first half. Harvard also shot 15 percent from beyond the arc in the first half compared to 35 percent throughout the season.
The sloppy offense by the Crimson led to a low-scoring first half that ended tied at 20—not even close to the normal pace needed to reach Harvard’s 72-point average per game.
“At halftime, we knew that we were playing well defensively and that we were getting good shots off that we normally hit,” Matera said.  “So we knew we had to grind it out for the final 20 minutes knowing we would eventually hit shots.”
With 18:04 left in the second half, Dartmouth took the lead, 23-20, on a jumper by senior Louise Vanden Bosch. But the Crimson turned the game around, going on a 12-2 run to give it the lead with 15:45 left to play.
After allowing the Big Green to score four quick points, Harvard responded with nine unanswered points, including two corner threes coming from Clark.
“In the second half, she helped us create a bit of space between us and Dartmouth,” Matera said. “She hit two big threes and took the ball to the basket hard.”
With a 12-point lead and 11:31 left in the game, the Crimson seemed to be closing the game up, but the hosts had other plans and clawed their way back. Scoring eight points without allowing a Harvard basket, the Big Green brought the deficit down to six points with 8:26 on the clock.
After exchanging baskets for the next four minutes, Dartmouth capitalized on a shooting foul on senior Cassie Cooper, making it a four-point game with 4:03 left to play. On the next possession, the Big Green responded with another two free throws to slim the lead to just two.
The pressure was on, but the Crimson responded with a long jumper by Clark, making it a two-possession game. Then Vanden Bosch responded with a long corner three-pointer to bring the lead to just one with 2:47 to go.
In need of points, the team looked to veteran Markley, who responded with a short jumper inside the paint. She finishes her career eighth all-time in scoring with 1,285 points and 10th all-time in rebounds with 645 boards.
After a foul on the other side of the court and Dartmouth over the foul limit, sophomore Victoria Lippert went to the line and converted both of her free throws with 1:27 left to play to extend a lead that the Big Green couldn’t overcome.
“We toughed it out and we did what we had to do to win,” junior Brogan Berry said.
The point guard had a solid all-around game, contributing 17 points with seven rebounds and four assists while adding three steals.
The visiting team’s 33.3 field-goal percentage edged out Dartmouth’s 29.5-percent shooting, but Harvard was outrebounded, 45-44.
The season comes to an end for a Crimson senior class that had aspirations of winning its second Ivy League Championship after bringing the title home its freshman year. Though the team ended up in the second spot for the third consecutive year, the seniors have high hopes for what is yet to come.
“As last words go for the team, just work hard, be disciplined, and enjoy every moment, because the four years go by so quickly,” Matera said.
“It was an experience that I won’t ever be able to replicate,” Markley added. “We’ve got a lot of talent and leadership returning ... We also have an incredible recruiting class coming in. I think next year the team can learn from our experiences this season and only grow from there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team—which captured its first Ivy League title on Saturday—must win one more game to earn its first berth in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament since 1946.
In the last regular-season contest, Princeton beat Penn (13-15, 7-7 Ivy), 70-58, on the road yesterday to force a one-game playoff with co-Ivy champion Harvard on Saturday.
Riding  on that game at Yale—selected as the neutral host for the play-in contest—is the league’s guaranteed spot in March Madness. The losing team will almost certainly not receive one of the tournament’s at-large bids.
Regardless of the outcome of the next game, the Crimson (23-5, 12-2) and the Tigers (24-6, 12-2) will share this year’s Ivy League title.
After defeating Princeton on Saturday, the Crimson was a half-game ahead of the Tigers in the Ivy League, and a Princeton loss yesterday would have sent Harvard to the tournament.
The Quakers kept the game close throughout the first half, but Princeton capitalized on Penn’s poor second-half shooting to take the must-win game.
For the first 21 minutes, a win seemed possible, as the Quakers built a 27-19 lead at the Palestra. But with a strong second-half performance, the Tigers pulled away from Penn, shooting 78 percent from the field and 4-5 from behind the arc.
“They had a tough first half, but the second half was unbelievable,” said Harvard junior co-captain Oliver McNally. “[Princeton forward Kareem] Maddox really dominated the game in the second half.”
Harvard dropped its first game against Princeton this season, 65-61, on Feb. 4. But after Brown upset the Tigers three weeks later, the Crimson again had a shot at the league title. Harvard evened the season series with its 79-67 win over Princeton last Saturday to take its share of the Ivy crown.
Despite Princeton’s strong second-half performance, the Crimson—who watched the game at Lavietes Pavilion—said that it will not change its preparations going into the weekend.
“Princeton did exactly what we thought they were going to do,” McNally said. “We were fully expecting them to win, so nothing’s really changed.”

Pforzheimer, Kirkland, and Winthrop have released new Housing Day videos, each in the style of popular musical videos. 
"Quad Can't Handle Me" is an ode to Pforzheimer House to the tune of "Club Can't Handle Me" by Flo Rida. Based on the new lyrics, it seems like future residents will handle it just fine.
 
Winthrop has released its first Housing Day video titled "Tonight (We're Throppin' You)," based off of the song "Tonight (I'm Lovin' You)" by Enrique Iglesias.
In fact, Winthrop's take on the song sounded so much like the original that YouTube blocked the video from being uploaded on copyright grounds, according to House Committee member Beau M. Feeny '13. 
"Apparently the track was too close to the original song, but we didn't have time to edit it," he said. 
 
Kirkland House goes on the offensive with the video "Kirkland House: Fuck Yeah." Based on the theme song of the movie "Team America: World Police," the video attempts to show why Kirkland House is "number one."

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
For a tiny House, Kirkland has a way of being the center of attention—a tragic drug-related murder occurred in its basement in 2009; Adam Wheeler faked his way past the Harvard admissions office and right into this House; and the now-storied birth of Facebook took place in a Kirkland dorm room.
Yet for a House that has been the site of some bad news, it is Kirkland's strong points that will make headlines on Housing Day: beautiful facilities, a prime location, and a warm, cozy community.
Dining Hall: Kirkland's sunny dining hall offers an elegant eatery complete with gleaming chandeliers and huge windows. With plenty of intimate four-person tables, you'll feel more like you're dining in a European café than an institutional cafeteria. Some think that the classy atmosphere goes too far; House Masters Tom C. and Verena A. Conley have expelled the napkin dispensers found on each table in other Houses, claiming that they are unattractive and entice people to gratuitously waste paper. You'll need to remember to grab a few napkins as you leave the servery if you want to avoid stains and spills far more unsightly than the prosaic dispensers. To make up for this quirky inconvenience, however, Kirkland may be the only House with original Minute Maid lemonade (not the watered-down light version) in its drink machine.
Facilities: Kirkland's best-kept secret might be Hicks House, a white house situated right behind Kirkland on JFK Street which contains a library restricted only to Kirklandites. Other study spaces are less desirable; the constant clanging of pipes makes the underground lounge area which formerly housed the Kirkland Grille a rather dismal place to work. People headed to the pool table or the laundry room pass right through the House gym, giving exercisers a disconcerting lack of privacy—but with the MAC so close by, Kirkland residents don't really need their own gym anyway.
Rooms: Whether you want to have one suitemate or seven, you can probably get your choice of room configuration. That being said, rooms run on the small side. Some sophomore rooms are extremely cramped, and you'll probably have to put up with walkthroughs or other sub-par setups until you finally get n+1 housing as a senior. Residents of the Annex enjoy a pretty, secluded courtyard between their building and the main House, but they must walk outside (though only a short distance) to get to the dining hall.
House spirit: Kirkland's annual winter formal is called IncestFest. That should tell you everything you need to know about how much this small community loves Kirkland—and each other. Residents enjoy a House ode, stein clubs on the patio in the gorgeous Kirkland courtyard when the weather is warm, and a weekly "Boat Club" which seems to have more to do with cookies than crew nowadays. Most notably, Kirkland holds an elaborate annual Secret Santa gift exchange in which the dining hall becomes the stage for hours' worth of sweet, silly, and strange presents from elves to their “santees” each night.
Location: Kirkland's lucky residents are just a quick jaunt down Dunster   Street from all the excitement of the Yard and the Square. They can pick up a Starbucks coffee from the Garage on their way to class and still be on time; and at night, they live in the very closest House to Noch's.
Quirks: The House proudly sponsors "Conversations with Kirkland," a lecture series that draws a remarkable line-up of heavy-hitting speakers to Kirkland's Junior and Senior Common Rooms each year. Visitors this year alone have included Chris Matthews, Lewis N. Black, and the filmmaking Farrelly brothers. These lectures are open to all students, not just Kirkland residents, though those who don't arrive early for these popular events may find themselves crammed into corners or sitting on the floor.
Rating: Although it may offer lackluster housing, Kirkland's beautiful courtyard and the warm community that populates it make this House a gem. For these reasons, Kirkland is rated third out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
3. Kirkland
4. Eliot
5. Pforzheimer
6. Quincy
7. Dunster
8. Leverett
9. Currier
10. Mather
11. Winthrop

Housing Day is quickly approaching, which means that Houses have been quickly releasing videos in the final days to make a positive impression on freshmen. 
 
Eliot's new video is a take on a Nike commercial featuring Lebron James. Unlike most of  the other videos, this one is dramatic.
 
Kirkland's latest housing video is much less aggressive than its previous effort. The video, "Waka Waka (This is Kirkland House)," is based off of the similarly titled Shakira song. Cabot also has a musically themed video and wishes the Class of 2014 "the best of luck." 
 
Mather takes the music video idea to a new level in "My Beautiful Dark Concrete Fantasy." The House which lays claim to the first Housing Day video keeps up the  pioneer spirit with the first Housing Day album. Will we see more of  these next year?
 
Watching  Charlie Sheen seems to be the new national pastime. Quincy has  capitalized on this by channelling the "passion" of the tiger-blooded  actor in "Quincy House: Bi-Winning." The video portrays Sheen as a Harvard freshman who is confident that his future residence will be Quincy.
 
Missed a Housing Day video? Have a favorite you can't seem to find? Don't worry—a new Housing Day channel on ShortForm displays almost all of the Housing Day videos and will be updated with new ones.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
At the center of attention on Mt. Auburn Street, Lowell House boasts two courtyards and a historical bell tower with an attitude. Easily accessible from all the River Houses and the hustle and bustle of Harvard Square, Lowell is a convenient home base where everything is just a few steps away.
Dining Hall: Who doesn't love a yellow-papered dining hall to brighten up their day? The social atmosphere of the dining area is hard to beat, but the practicality of the servery could use some work. During Sunday Brunch, the kitchen grill moves out of the servery and turns into an omelet table spread right in the dining hall—the extra personal attention is definitely a real treat. But watch out when the Lowell House Opera moves in during the Spring. The dining room space gets cut in half, and restrictions are more strictly enforced.
Facilities: The Lowell Grille under O entryway may not be an actual grille, but it's a nice hangout nonetheless. Cozy couches, foosball, and pool tables complete the common space perfect for parties or large meetings. Elsewhere in the Lowell basement, you can find two classrooms and a mediocre dance studio transformed from a squash court. The Junior Common Room across from the dining hall is warmly decorated and plenty spacious. The Tower Room under the Lowell Bells houses a historic collection of the Russian Bells photos.
Rooms: There's a very good chance that you'll be put into one of Lowell's walkthrough doubles as a sophomore. The rooms are small, and the stairs steep, and it doesn't get much better as a junior. But with such proximity to everything else at Harvard, why would you complain much about your small, dank room anyway? Lowell's party suite is the Lowell Labyrinth, the nine-room senior suite located above the library.
House Spirit: House spirit has definitely improved recently, but with many of the residents, the energy's a hit or a miss. The House list, for instance, isn't exactly the place for lively discussion. It's probably the lack of an actual mascot or the fact that everything has basically been accounted for, but Lowellians don't need House spirit to compensate for much.
Location: It may not be overlooking the Charles, but it's definitely the center of attention. Just a few blocks away in every direction from any prominent part of campus, Lowell certainly has the location perks down pat. It even sits adjacent to the Community Garden.
Quirks: If you love tradition or don't mind a little extra noise, the Lowell Bells will ring every Sunday at 1 p.m. The weekly Masters' Teas with House Masters Diana Eck and Dorothy Austin are a must. There's a bouldering wall that sets up challenging routes every semester. Lowell Bacchanalia is one of two most popular spring formals. Hear student speeches in the dining hall at 7:20 p.m. each weekday.
Rating: Due to its prime location, beautiful facilities, and many quirks, Lowell House is ranked second out of 12.
Our rankings so far:

3. Kirkland
4. Eliot
5. Pforzheimer

Although some lucky seniors have already turned in their theses, many are still furiously researching and writing. As an aid to those who have yet to turn in their magnum opus, we've compiled a list of places in the Square that will print your thesis for you (once it's written).
FedEx Office Print & Ship Center
1 Mifflin Place
617-497-0125
According to FedEx Manager Greg E. Downing, the copy center can typically turn around a thesis in 4 to 12 hours, depending on how busy they are. Black and white printing on thesis quality paper costs $0.22 per page for both single-sided and double-sided printing. FedEx can also coil bind your finished work for an additional $5.50. Downing estimates that a few dozen students print their theses at FedEx.
FlashPrint
99 Mt. Auburn St.
617-492-7767
FlashPrint, located in the basement of 99 Mt. Auburn St., charges $0.15 per black and white single-sided printed page of high quality bond stock paper. Alan I. Shapiro, FlashPrint's owner, estimates that hundreds of students print their theses at FlashPrint.
"We see students come in who haven't slept for 36 hours. We try to appease them, but it's not always easy," Shapiro said.
Gnomon Copy
1308 Mass. Ave.
617-491-1111
Gnomon Copy charges $3.00 for a digital upload of your thesis, $0.08 per page for black and white ($0.55 for color) printing and an additional $0.04 per page for thesis quality paper. Gnomon Copy attempts to print theses while students wait in the store, but students are suggested to come back in a few hours if they are busy.
Staples
57 JFK St.
617-491-1166
Staples can print a thesis in approximately an hour, provided there are no other orders in the queue. At Staples, it will cost about $21 to print a 50 page, double-sided thesis on thesis quality paper (we suggest you bring your Staples Rewards Card—you'll get 10 percent back in the form of a coupon at the end of the month). Hundreds of hysterical and panicked students use Staples for their thesis printing needs each year, according to Manager Wajeeh Anwar.
Downing, Shapiro, and Anwar all urged students not to procrastinate and leave thesis printing to the last minute.  Good luck putting the finishing touches on the bane of your existence (at least for these past few weeks) and proceed with the important final step of printing.
