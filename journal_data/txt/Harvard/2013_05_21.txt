After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Nieman Foundation of Journalism has named 24 journalists from across the globe to the 2013-2014 class of Nieman Fellows, who will take temporary leaves from their journalism careers to study at Harvard.
The mid-career fellowship gives journalists with at least five years of professional experience the opportunity to engage in a specific area of research, audit courses from across the University, and participate in various seminars for 10 months starting in the fall.
“It’s an intensity that is not focused on producing a story for tomorrow’s newspaper or magazine or radio station. It’s a chance to focus on skill-building and intellectual pursuits,” said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation.
The Nieman Foundation selected 12 U.S. journalists and 12 international journalists as Fellows, and received 136 U.S. applications and 136 international ones.
“It’s a chance for me to step back from a daily pressure and sit back and think about some of the bigger questions of trends I’ve been covering,” said Jeffrey R. Young, one of the 2013-2014 Nieman fellows, who covers technology as a senior editor and writer from the Chronicle of Higher Education.
While at Harvard, Young will study the impact of massive open online courses on higher education. Young said in an interview that he is specifically excited to be researching this issue at Harvard, where he will have the opportunity to connect with people from the Berkman Center, the Graduate School of Education, and EdX—Harvard and MIT’s joint online education venture.
“This new idea of doing online education in this way has raised a lot of questions and there are a lot left unanswered,” Young said. “I feel very much like a new student coming in.”
Tammerlin Drummond, another Nieman fellow and a metro columnist for the Bay Area News Group, said she is interested in engaging with professors at the School of Public Health to study gun violence as a public health issue.
“In order to get a full view of it, you have to take a step back from the day-to-day, going from the funerals and the homicide days,” Drummond said.
Dina Temple-Raston, a counterterrorism correspondent for National Public Radio, is the first to receive the Murrey Marder Nieman Fellowship in Watchdog Journalism, named in memory of Murrey Marder, a former Nieman Fellow who passed away in March.
Lipinski had been conversing with Marder last year about the future of watchdog journalism and how to integrate his interests with the Foundation.
“It’s great that [Temple-Raston is] a Washington journalist. I think Murrey would have liked that,” Lipinski said.
In addition to the individual projects, Nieman fellows will have the opportunity to meet and collaborate with each other. While 24 Nieman Fellows were picked for the coming class, Lipinski said she and the other members of the selection committee thought with 25 in mind.
“The 25th [fellow] is the character of the class. We want them very much connected to each other and finding opportunities in each other’s work,” Lipinski said.
For the 2012-2013 Nieman Fellows, crowdsourcing was a popular topic of collaborative study. Many of the fellows focused on the huge presence of social media in the coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings, Lipinski said.
“The extent to which their working together in teams has been part of what makes a class coming together, I see a lot of potential for that from the incoming class,” Lipinski said.
Many of the fellows are looking into the future of the journalism industry and how to take advantage of digital platforms. Tyler Cabot, a new Nieman Fellow and an article editor at Esquire, said he will explore long-form journalism.
“It’ll be great to trade notes with the other people in magazine. And in the end, we’re all doing storytelling in different ways,” Cabot said.
The Nieman Foundation will be celebrating its 75th anniversary in the fall, where the newest class will be able to participate in reunion programming.

Sarah E. Thomas, director of Oxford University’s library system, was appointed vice president for the Harvard Library, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in a press release Monday.
Thomas will take over the responsibilities formerly held by Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy, who is leaving Harvard to lead the New York Public Library as its Chief Library Officer.
Thomas, a member of the faculty at Oxford, was the first woman and non-British citizen in four centuries to lead the Bodleian Libraries, a group of nearly 40 libraries that serve the university. She previously worked as the university librarian at Cornell.
“Sarah Thomas is a leader in her field with an exceptional record of success running major academic libraries. She is uniquely capable of building on the progress we have made thus far in responding to the evolving expectations of the 21st century scholar,” Garber said in the press release.
After graduating from Smith College in 1970, Thomas earned a master’s degree in library science from Simmons College in 1973 and received her Ph.D. in German literature from Johns Hopkins University in 1983.

Fifteen institutions of higher education joined edX on Tuesday, expanding Harvard and MIT’s one-year-old virtual learning venture for the first time to Asia and more than doubling the rapidly expanding platform’s size.
The 15 schools span the globe, with six additions from Asia, five in the United States, three from Europe, and one from Australia. Their addition brings the total number of universities in the nonprofit X Consortium to 27.
“As we continue to grow the X Consortium and offer courses from institutions as diverse as our global community of students, we are moving forward with our mission to reimagine education,” said Anant Agarwal, president of edX, in a press release announcing the additions. “These schools, with their unique faculties and student bodies, will help us conduct collaborative research on best practices which improve education online and on campus.”
The new additions in Asia include many of the continent’s most prestigious universities. They are Tsinghua University and Peking University in China, the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong, Kyoto University in Japan, and Seoul National University in South Korea.
With the addition of Cornell University, edX will expand to its second Ivy League school. The other American institutions joining edX are Berklee College of Music, Boston University, Davidson College, and the University of Washington.
The expansion into Europe includes Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet, Belgium’s Université catholique de Louvain, and Germany’s Technical University of Munich. The addition of the University of Queensland marks Australia’s second entrant into edX.
The new members will offer courses on the edX platform beginning in late 2013 or 2014. These institutions will offer courses in topics ranging from the sciences and humanities to political science and language. Hong Kong University will offer “Vernacular Heritage in Asia,” “Chinese and Western Philosophy,” “Infectious Disease and Public Health,” and “Law, Economy and Society,” while the University of Queensland courses will include “Tropical Coastal Ecosystems” and “The Science of Everyday Thinking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University will call its upcoming capital campaign “The Harvard Campaign,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin confirmed Tuesday.
In an email sent last Thursday whose subject line served as the first acknowledgement of the campaign’s title to large portions of the Harvard community, University President Drew G. Faust outlined seven “overarching principles” that will guide the initiative’s fundraising efforts.
The message, sent to Harvard’s faculty and staff, identified those seven points as interdisciplinary research and learning, investment in students and faculty, novel teaching and learning techniques, the globalization of knowledge, exploration of civilizations and values, hands-on discovery, and the creation of a physical campus that captures Harvard’s goals.
The campaign is projected to raise billions of dollars across Harvard’s various Schools and will launch in September, ending a two-year quiet phase focused on gauging donor interest and determining campaign priorities. Donors have predicted that the campaign will seek to raise more than $6 billion, likely topping Stanford’s recent record-breaking $6.2 billion fundraising drive.
The overarching principles, Faust wrote in the email, “will propel Harvard towards its fifth century of intellectual distinction, enabling us to solve pressing problems, to educate leaders, and to generate ideas that meet the complexities of our times.”
Galvin said the University chose not to use a name resembling a slogan, as peer institutions have done with similar initiatives. “The Stanford Challenge” and Yale’s $3.88 billion “Yale Tomorrow” each ended in 2011 and Princeton’s $1.88 billion “Aspire Campaign” came to a close in 2012.
Although “The Harvard Campaign” may differ in tone from other titles, Faust’s email framed the initiative as a way to get one step closer to attaining “the broader power of one Harvard,” an ambition for a more unified and interconnected University and a concept that Faust has emphasized numerous times during her presidency.
“You will hear a great deal in the months and years to come about The Harvard Campaign,” Faust wrote. “It offers us an extraordinary opportunity to strengthen each School and to work together across School boundaries in pursuit of larger common purposes.”
