After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Re: HUDS Suspends Purchases from Israeli Soda Company
We read with dismay in the December 17 issue of the Crimson that Harvard University Dining Services had decided to suspend the purchase of water machines from a company linked to the Israeli company SodaStream. This decision, made as a result of pressure by a number of campus groups like the Harvard College Palestinian Solidarity Committee, which supports the anti-Israel Boycott, Divest, Sanction movement, is short-sighted and extremely disappointing.
SodaStream is a company that employs some five hundred Palestinians alongside Israeli Jews; it goes without saying that company employees are treated as equals in everything from salary and benefits to religious freedom (the factory includes a mosque). Attacking companies like SodaStream, where Palestinians and Israelis interact on an everyday basis, and in which Palestinian workers can earn a sustainable livelihood, is directly detrimental to the coexistence that exists in areas where Muslims and Jews are neighbors, like Jerusalem and its outskirts.
It is furthermore dismaying to us that HUDS or any other Harvard body would cave in to the demands of the anti-Israel BDS movement. Regardless of one’s views on the politics of the Middle East (which would hopefully be informed by a watchful view of current events in Syria, Iraq and Yemen), BDS’s tactic of delegitimizing Israel as a state is to be censured rather than given official voice via Harvard policies.
As proud alumni, we applaud the initiative of University President Drew G. Faust to reevaluate this hasty and unfortunate decision.  We urge Harvard’s administration to promote the positive connections with Israel that have for so long characterized Harvard as an institution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard guard Kaitlyn Dinkins was heating up.
On the Crimson’s last possession, Dinkins had answered a Louisiana Tech three-pointer with a trey of her own. Now, with 15 minutes left in the second half, the senior guard watched as another of her long-distance heaves fell through the net.
The Harvard bench erupted. After facing a 17-point deficit earlier in the half, the team had clawed back to trail, 50-41. The corresponding shift in momentum was large enough to cause the Lady Techsters to motion for a timeout.
“It felt good to be able to help my team climb back in the game,” Dinkins said. “I was set up very well by my teammates for all of my shots.”
But Harvard’s celebration ended when play resumed. Over the next two minutes, Louisiana Tech (5-5) rebuilt the lead with a 9-0 run that ultimately doomed the Crimson (5-5) to an 83-64 loss in the first round of the Georgia Tech Holiday Classic in Atlanta.
Louisiana Tech first took control by holding Harvard scoreless for an eight-minute period that spanned the end of the first half and the beginning of the second.
“We didn’t execute our offense,” Dinkins said. “I think it was less about their defense and more about us. They crashed the boards hard, and we didn’t match their intensity.”
With 5:29 left in the first half, Harvard forward Erin McDonnell converted a free throw to tie the score at 26 apiece. The Crimson would not score again until three minutes into the second half. By that point, the Lady Techsters owned a 17-point advantage.
Louisiana Tech relied on strong box-outs to keep Harvard at bay. On the game, the Lady Techsters outrebounded Harvard, 53-39, and six players grabbed five or more boards.
“Going into this game, we knew that rebounding was one of Louisiana Tech’s strengths,” junior forward AnnMarie Healy said. “Unfortunately, we were not able to control this part of the game due to an inconsistent effort and mental commitment.”
The Lady Techsters rode bench contributions to victory. Louisiana Tech’s second unit racked up 51 points, including a gritty 19 from Tiara Davenport. The freshman guard repeatedly attacked the basket despite contact and finished with seven points from the charity stripe.
“They pushed it very well in transition,” Dinkins said. “We didn’t get back quick enough or make the adjustment.”
Meanwhile, the Crimson’s bench accounted for 15 points on a combined 4-for-20 performance.
After parrying Dinkins’ three-pointers with a convincing run, the Lady Techsters never gave Harvard much of a chance of getting back into the game. For the rest of the second half, the Crimson never got closer than 13.
Senior forward Temi Fagbenle led the Harvard attack with 16 points on 8-for-11 shooting and seven rebounds. The performance furthered a yearlong campaign in which Fagbenle is averaging a double-double, putting up 14.4 points and 11.7 rebounds per game.
“[Fagbenle] is not only a vocal leader, but also leads the team by doing,” Healy said. “Her success comes from her dedication to this team, commitment to consistency, and ability to lead by example, not just words.”
Forward Erin McDonnell finished with 15 points, and Dinkins contributed 12 by shooting 4-for-5 from three-point land.
Although the Crimson had not played in nine days, the team showed little rust in the early going. After Dinkins sank a three-pointer in the first 10 seconds, Harvard intermittently held the lead until the 14-minute mark of the first half, when the Crimson’s scoreless stretch began.
Harvard’s defeat denied the team an appearance in the final of the Georgia Tech Holiday Classic. Instead, the Crimson will face Lipscomb University, which lost by 18 to Georgia Tech later on Monday, in Tuesday’s consolation game.
“It comes back to inconsistency,” Healy said. “I love playing for this team and have so much faith in our success…. [It’s] disappointing after how hard we all worked in preparation for the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4/4 Harvard men’s ice hockey team was firing on all cylinders entering its break for final exams, reeling off a six-game winning streak and nabbing a share of first place in the conference race. The Crimson hopes that the 24-day hiatus from conference play hasn’t cooled the team off.
In its last game of the calendar year, Harvard (9-1-2, 5-1-2 ECAC) resumes its ECAC slate as it hosts Rensselaer in Cambridge on Tuesday. The Crimson returns to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for intercollegiate play for the first time in over a month to try to keep pace with No. 15/15 Quinnipiac for first place in the conference.
“This is our only league game in a while, so these two points are enormous,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “We need to play like we’re a first place team.”
Coming out of their own two-week break, the Engineers (6-12-1, 4-4-0) are hoping to reverse their luck. RPI has not won since before Thanksgiving and is riding a five-game losing skid. The Engineers have not lost by fewer than two goals since November 28.
RPI will also be looking to erase the memories of an earlier blowout loss to Harvard on home ice. Two power play goals from junior forward Jimmy Vesey and 14 saves from junior goaltender Steve Michalek powered the Crimson to a 4-0 win at the Houston Field House in early November.
“We need to make sure that they don’t pin us in the corners at all,” Criscuolo said. “We just need to use our speed to take advantage of their defensemen [like last game].”
Vesey has added seven more over the course of conference play, which has him ranked second in the conference in goals scored.
The Engineers have had troubles on defense in recent games. Led by senior goaltender Scott Diebold, RPI has averaged five goals against in its last four contests. Such a slide does not bode well for the Engineers against a high-flying Crimson offense that has averaged four goals in its last four games.
The Crimson had four of the 10 highest point scorers in the league entering its break, despite having played fewer games than most teams in the conference. Vesey ranks fifth with 17 points. Criscuolo, sophomore forward Alexander Kerfoot, and junior defenseman Patrick McNally are not far behind.
McNally has provided key production from the blue line this season. The Milton Academy grad leads all Division I defenders with 1.25 points per game.
“Pat’s a versatile player,” Criscuolo said. “He’s great defensively, has a great stick. Offensively, he’s deceivingly fast and uses his reach well and finds some guys in front of the net. He’s been huge for us in terms of logging ice time.”
The Crimson hopes not to have to rely on its hot scoring to pull out the win against the Engineers. Harvard ranks third in the conference in goals against, while Michalek ranks second in save percentage with a .944 success rate.
While RPI ranks near the middle of the conference in goals for, a scoring star has not yet emerged for the Engineers. Sophomore Riley Bourbonnais and junior Milos Bubela lead the team with four goals each. Three of Bourbonnais’ goals on the year came in a hat trick against Union on Nov. 1. Harvard has six players who have beat the opposing goalie at least four times on the year.
“Depth this year is definitely one of our strong suits,” sophomore forward Tyler Moy said. “We have a lot of players who are contributing on offense. Obviously people can’t be their best every night, so it’s nice to know you have players by your side who can pick up your slack when things aren’t going well.
A win for the Crimson would accomplish something that has not been done in over a decade. Harvard has not won seven games in a row since March 2004.

2015 is surprisingly only a couple of days away, and we’re all probably wondering what in the world we’ve accomplished this past year (with the exception of procrastinating, napping, and going to Lamont only to be on Facebook for 3 hours). Unless you’re spending your time vacationing in a foreign country or volunteering in an NGO, here are some of things to do if you want to squeeze in a little productivity before the year ends:
1) Making space on your phoneA new year means new music, new gifs and new photos, so you should probably remove all those old pics to make room. Because if a moment isn’t uploaded to Instagram, did it really happen? Do you actually need all those embarrassing bathroom selfies you took at those parties from last semester? And no, you don’t need 20 blurry pics of you trying to get a photo of the Harvard turkey en route to class. Besides, you need room for all those New Year's Eve selfies to post on FB.
2) Catching up on all the shows you’ve missedIn between all the studying and networking you’ve been doing, you might’ve fallen behind on your favorite TV shows or put off starting new ones.  How embarrassing would it be to say that you haven't finished "House of Cards" by the end of this year– social faux pas much? Maybe binge on "Orange is the New Black" or listen to "Serial." If you can complete a ten page paper in a single night (don’t deny it), you can definitely watch all the (few) episodes of "Ivy" and "Absent."
3) Helping Someone Out With their College ApplicationsThough most of us blacked out life before college, don’t forget that many high school seniors are working on their applications to college right now. Whether it’s a family member or someone from your old school, there's probably someone out there who’s procrastinated on their apps. Maybe you’re feeling super charitable from the holiday season or perhaps you’re feeling guilty about the lack of community service you’ve done this past year, but give out last minute tips, help edit essays, or tell high school seniors any iteration of “You’re (insert synonym for amazing/awesome/great/wonderful)” incase they’re assessing their self-worth entirely on what they wrote in their Common Apps.
4) Planning for the next semester and summerIt’s a great time to start thinking about what you want to do this summer, applying for programs and funding, or re-editing your resume for the tenth time. You might also want to start shopping for next semester’s classes on the CS50 site. But then again, what even is college if you don’t procrastinate, aka wait until the last day of break to see what classes you’re going to tomorrow?
