After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’re on fire. The grins of approval from your classmates. Snaps echoing through the lecture hall. Maybe even a nod from your professor. It's the academic validation and social reward that every Harvard student craves. Maybe it’s what compels you to ask a question in class, one for which you already know the answer, or make a comment with the ulterior motive of brandishing your wokeness.
By no means am I saying that all or even the majority of classroom contributions are inherently theatrical. All of us have comments to make that can improve our collective academic experience. It is also important to acknowledge that it takes courage to speak up in a lecture hall or to disagree with someone in a position of power. In fact, it should be the bare minimum to call out racism, homophobia, classism, and any other form of discrimination in our classrooms.
The issue arises, however, when we contribute to a self-righteous, narcissistic culture of truisms, and ultimately lower the bar for our academic discussions.
Eloquent analyses of social groups and oppression become boxes to check in our classroom monologues of glory. Buzzwords and SAT vocabulary shine, but our commitment to critically thinking about social problems dwindles and our dedication to advertising our moral superiority grows. Sharing an intellectual analysis of Marx’s Das Kapital – making sure everyone in your class knows you read theory – becomes more important than meaningfully engaging in classroom discussions or listening and reflecting on the lived experiences of our classmates.
Beyond being annoying, performative acts in the classroom weaponize social justice, redirecting the focus on rewarding individuals for their social awareness rather than dismantling oppressive structures. Social justice has become a race to prove our self-righteousness, and superfluous attempts at proving ourselves as anti-racists have ultimately co-opted the spaces where critical discussions centering rigorous self-questioning and comprehensive debate occur. This culture of conversation rewards performance over nuance and delivery over content, with some of the most insidious forms of hypocrisy and tokenism sacrificing meaningful intellectual growth.
We are all left with this strange and disingenuous feeling that our ideological truisms should be advertised, but even more, that social justice is just a glossary of jargon to be used as pawns in a verbal battle of intellectual justice, one you win by using the biggest words and speaking with the most conviction.
Worst of all, this culture encourages students to limit their activism to the classroom, and in the classroom only. I mean, what’s in it for us to think that climate change is real if our classmates can’t pat us on the back for it, right?
We end up thinking that we don’t have to commit ourselves to social justice because our work in the classroom is enough validation to be labeled a patron for equity and inclusion. In the ivory towers of our Harvard classes, we get to put on the temporary activist hat, appointing ourselves as spokespeople for marginalized groups to which we may not necessarily belong, but ultimately overlooking the victims who feel the brunt of injustice far beyond any classroom.
It’s time for a mindset shift. In class, we should not see ourselves as performers on a stage or soldiers in an intellectual battle. As gratifying as we feel it is to speak up in class, we should feel the same zeal for listening and introspection, appreciation for the endless potential that classrooms give us to look inward and expand our own ideological spectrums.
This semester, let's reinterpret our classrooms as mediums for critical self-reflection and vulnerability, opportunities to interrogate our preconceived biases and educate ourselves to be more mindful learners. After all, in a world of finger-pointing and constant self-defense, classrooms are one of the safest places for us to swallow our pride and look inwards, and what may momentarily feel like defeat in a heated class discussion can later blossom into a pivotal moment for growth.
So, the next time you raise your hand in your lecture, your section, or your seminar, ask yourself if you’re truly interested in contributing to the discussion or if it’s the attention and the approval you crave. Because for marginalized folks and each of us who experiences life beyond the classroom, social justice means more than just outwardly flexing your intellectual muscles or name-dropping obscure social theories – it involves real world issues with real-world implications.
Starting from 2023, let’s choose active listening and introspection over mindless interjections, or vulnerability over stubborn dogmatism. It’s time that we raise the bar for what constitutes a meaningful classroom contribution, for ourselves and for others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m not a pessimist.
I don’t dwell on things that have gone wrong or might go wrong. I do my best not to be miserable in the face of, well, the state of the world. In fact, on occasion, I’ve been known to look forward to things with a sense of hope — wild, I know.
But recently, as I have doomscrolled through my Twitter feed, watching politicians and celebrities alike sink to new lows and crying at the cancellation of a concert I was really looking forward to after the band broke up, my perspective has been colored somewhat differently. It seems, when something can go wrong, it most certainly will go wrong. If these past few pandemic years have taught me anything, it’s that maybe a healthy dose of pessimism is a good thing. In fact, being sensibly pessimistic is a wonderfully optimistic way to live your life.
Hear me out. I come from the United Kingdom, a famously miserable place. You’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t have a bone to pick with the government, their neighbor, or God himself for making the weather so consistently rubbish. Complaining and being generally grouchy is what we do. But one of our favorite national pastimes is making fun of the particular brand of west-coast, Hollywood-smiles, good-vibes-only optimism that has spawned a self-help revolution. Quite frankly, we were doing fine before we were told “You Are a Badass” or how to harness “The Power of Now” (yes, those are real books).
While there is evidence that having a relentlessly optimistic outlook on life has positive effects on happiness, it conjures a different image for me — namely, that of someone hanging a “Live, Laugh, Love” poster in their soft-walled cell as they laugh maniacally about how comfortable their straitjacket is. I just don’t get it. How grating must it be on one’s friends and family to hear nothing but glib platitudes while they go through incredibly tough times? Nothing is more infuriating than someone living in a fantasy land while those around them suffer; it’s like telling a depressed friend to just cheer up.
Instead, perhaps counterintuitively, one of the healthiest things we can do is recognize that the world is absolutely falling apart right now. Our democracy is in decline, civil rights are being systematically rolled back, and the climate disaster is raging on — pick your favorite apocalypse. While thinking positively may be good for one’s health, it’s a matter of perspective: beaming as the world crumbles around you is borderline psychotic.
Imagine, if you will, traveling back in time to meet your boomer relatives as children. They’d look at you like you had three heads if you so much as hinted at the state of the world you’d come from. It would be tough to convince them not to be pessimistic while you told them your wish for 2023 was for the world to finally shake the last vestiges of a deadly pandemic so you could stop carrying a spare mask around when trying to see a movie. That is, if the movie theater hadn’t been destroyed by a routine freak weather event. And if the staff all hadn’t quit because their boss refused to pay them a living wage. Oh, and if the production company hadn’t scrapped the entire movie for cost reasons. Really takes the shine off the golden days, doesn’t it?
Here’s where the optimistic part comes in, though. The pandemic changed how I make plans — contingency plans are a requirement on every holiday, last minute cancellations are no longer a surprise, and frankly, I’m surprised when any public transport or mail is on time anymore. I and many other optimistic pessimists set expectations very low, so as to be either prepared for the worst or pleasantly surprised by anything better. When you think about it, what could be a more optimistic outlook than that? Imagine every single thing in your life being either exactly what you expected, or a nice surprise. The most powerful good-vibes shaman in the world could only dream of a set of outcomes so favorable.
This is not to say that I advocate for misery or detest hope. I firmly believe that we as a generation have the power to fix the problems we face, and to do so will require more than a little faith and belief in ourselves. It is also not to say one should not be resilient — one thing I’ve always admired about Americans is their ability to keep getting up with a smile, no matter how many times they’ve been knocked down. I just think it’s worth taking a look at the world before setting our expectations too high. Take the wins when they come, and don’t worry when it all goes wrong — because it will.

Glenda R. Carpio is Chair of the Department of English, a Professor of African and African American Studies, and lecturer for the flagship freshman literature course Humanities 10, otherwise known as Hum 10.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Why did you want to teach [Hum 10] when you came to Harvard?
GC: I think one of the major reasons why Hum 10 is so important is that it allows us to rethink the Great Books course. That template is so problematic.
I think about what it would be like to convey to first-year students coming in the importance of literary history, the importance of deep thinking across time, in different genres, that we still really believe in that.
I think Hum 10 at Harvard has tried — especially in the last few years — to really revise that structure to provide for students the benefits of Great Books courses without its Eurocentric biases. Of course, you can never quite get away from it. We repeatedly get criticisms from students that it doesn’t include this and doesn’t include that, but I don’t think you could ever have a perfect Hum 10.
FM: I was going to ask about that, getting that bad rap for being too white and too old and too male. I’m wondering how that shows up in your conversations in seminars and how you and your colleagues have tried to be inclusive of identities and different perspectives.
GC: We try different things. One year, Professor Greenblatt taught “Othello” but paired it with Toni Morrison's play “Desdemona,” which takes the perspective of Desdemona, and it becomes a conversation between Shakespeare and Morrison.
It was really productive for students to be able to talk about a Shakespeare play that’s controversial, but to have Morrison also, as someone — an ally — who’s there thinking through difficult questions. I think we have also tried to diversify who is at the helm. For instance, this last year, Professor Namwali Serpell delivered a few great lectures on “Frankenstein” and on Morrison’s “Beloved.”
We can never get away entirely from canon wars, but I think we are chipping at it.
FM: I’ve heard that there is a really good conversation that happens around the idea of the immigrant success story and how immigrants are treated in the United States generally. I’m wondering what you think about that. What are the questions that you ask your students in the conversation you start?
GC: When you think of immigrant literature, you're likely to think of a story about how one comes to America and makes a life in America. And, for me, I think that’s been a really important story and needs to be told again and again. But I do think that that acculturation plot papers over other major concerns that people are writing about when they write about immigration.
We need to think about things like undocumented migration. We need to think about how climate is already impacting migration, and I think keeping with stories that are about a singular person or community doesn't give us the broad perspective that we also need to understand migration. Some of my research in this area has informed our discussions in seminar.
I hope it’s an invitation for students to be curious about a whole set of artists who are not writing the acculturation plot and are employing different formal means to get us to think about migration in connection to climate, to politics, to economics, and not just the Bildungsroman of someone’s individual life or a community trying to acculturate.
FM: Where do you think Harvard fits into this spectrum of immigrant narratives from acculturation to really being a social and political examination of how the country works?
GC: There’s a spectrum, and one part of the spectrum is if you’re an immigrant and you’re at Harvard then you are the poster child of the so-called American Dream. So I think in that way Harvard is a kind of marker of a very well-rehearsed mythical story. And I think there’s a lot under that that’s more complicated. If you’re an immigrant at Harvard you also have a kind of social tax — do you really belong at Harvard? Experienced from the other side, there’s a sense of, it doesn’t feel like an American Dream at all. It feels like something else. It’s very challenging.
It’s a comforting American myth for those who are not immigrants, but see immigrants at Harvard. The underbelly of that is much more complicated for people who are actually immigrants at Harvard. And then somewhere in the middle of that spectrum is the reality that Harvard is also a place that hasn’t embraced migration as much as it could as an area of inquiry.
With the restructuring of arts and humanities — I’ve been part of the committee with Dean Kelsey — we’re really thinking about how we need to make that more of an area where students can come and understand migration from different vantage points. Not just from literature, from economics, or from politics, but really investigate this area of life that’s so affecting the world.
FM: I want to know a little bit more about your own immigration to the United States and what that was like for you.
GC: I came to the States when I was 12. I didn't speak English, and that was really rough, because 12 is a hard age for anybody.
I went to middle and high school in Westchester, New York — not very diverse. In high school, some really stupid people used to nickname me Taco Bell. It’s really rough stuff that can leave marks — I mean, really nasty, you know? I think it’s really important to understand just how much migration hurts psychologically, emotionally. But I also think that it’s important for me not to dwell on those things publicly, because I am one of the many, many people who have suffered, and sometimes I think the plot of acculturation is solipsistic.
Acculturation takes the suffering that you go through and says, “Yes, but look I’ve survived, and I’m successful!” I’m less interested in that and more interested in the millions of people who don’t make it — like what happens to those who undone by the violence of having to be uprooted, often separated from families, living under what I call carceral migration, which is the kind of waiting for papers, being undocumented. I think it behooves us to look up and see what I call in my book “migrant solidarity.”
FM: How did your experience in high school and your initial years in the United States bring you to the Teach for America program?
GC: In college, I remember I didn’t want to go work for “the man.” I have to do something, right? So I went to Compton. I was only 21 and, as an immigrant, I had traveled from the so-called third world to the first world. But I hadn’t actually seen how the third world can be within the first world.
Compton looked to me and felt to me like Guatemala, and it made me ask really big questions about why. I was teaching eighth grade my first year, and I had students who were basically illiterate. They couldn’t really read and write, and they had a great deal of shame about it. And I really asked myself, “We’re like a half-hour drive from Hollywood, and what disparities of wealth and power — how?” So I think that made me want to go to grad school and understand America, not as the place that I longed to acculturate into but as the phenomenon that includes so much injustice within this democratic structure. So for me, Compton was a real school.
FM: Why did that lead to English and African & African American Studies as your specific areas of scholarship?
GC: With my eighth graders in Compton, we would listen to books and read along, so that those who couldn’t really read could hear, and they started to be able to know stories about Malcolm X or Frederick Douglass, or really hear ideas and concepts that they didn’t associate with school. They associated school with doing time. For them, the carceral and school were very much interlinked.
I think some of the bigger questions that my students and their lives there made me ask led me to specialize in African and African American Studies and to writing about Black humor, which has a whole different set of intellectual questions about why we laugh. It’s such a big part of the human experience. I wanted to explore that and see how humor has been used not just as a coping mechanism, but also as a way of protesting without falling into sentiment or falling into straight aggression.
FM: When do you think that change in public awareness or public conversation happened where we started to focus so much on what's not funny? When did we change the way we joke?
GC: I’m about to teach a course that I haven’t taught in a long time, which is my “Black Humor” course, and so I think this question that you asked is a real pressing one, for which I don’t have a straight answer.
It’s not just political correctness, which was something else in earlier decades. It’s something like, we’re so hypervigilant about truth and not truth, and like fake images and fake narratives. I think it’s part of a broader question about how our realities are made and when we don’t share the same reality. Humor is about having an understanding, that you have a basic point where you do meet. You might not find it fully funny — people laugh in and out of synchronicity, depending on your race or gender — but I think the common denominator is a respect for humanity.
FM: I’m wondering when you think humor is more effective: when it's used for the cause of social justice — like the jokes people use to reappropriate things that have been used against them — or when it's used to reinforce stereotypes about an oppressed or marginalized group?
GC: There are so many times when we find ourselves confronted by humor that is just really evil. Condemning it wholeheartedly is actually not the best strategy, because it seems to push it down, and inevitably, it comes up anyway. One of the things humor does is to keep yourself nimble and to be able to see something that’s life-threatening and to be able to skirt it somehow.
I think we need to know that our particular social moment is particular because people didn't have the internet before, you know. But there have been instances where similar challenges have been posed to humans, and we could learn from the past.
FM: I heard that you split your time between Cambridge and Venice. I’m wondering how Cambridge could ever compare?
GC: One of the things about Cambridge is that really, it’s about the intensity of Harvard. We have so many people come through when the semester is going that it does feel like there’s a kind of intensity that’s like New York, which is my other city.
It’s not as beautiful as Venice, but few places are. One of the things that Venice allows for as well for me is some perspective. When you’re at Harvard — often because of the intellectual richness, but also because it’s very aware of itself as a brand — people lose perspective. It’s a great university, it’s an amazing place, but the world is bigger. So when I leave, I appreciate that perspective, because I think it makes me better when I come back to Harvard.
FM: My very last question is if you could tell me something that no one knows about you? As in, no other writer.
GC: This is pretty personal, but I had to divorce my family, which is very painful, so it made me have to think about the concept of family. I think that when it works, it’s amazing. I have many dear friends, and their families are so lovely, and I’m invited to be part of that. I think when family works, it’s an amazing institution. But when it doesn’t, it also shows you that it can be a very oppressive cultural institution. Even though it wasn’t easy, it did show me that you don’t have to follow societal norms. If your wellbeing is challenged by that norm, that norm needs to be gone.
FM: Thank you for sharing that. I’m glad I asked, because I think I’ve met a lot of students who could benefit from hearing that advice.
GC: I think we should be able to say more about that. It’s often not because people are evil. It's just that people have intergenerational trauma. And it gets to a point that somebody has to break it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander S. Vindman, a key witness in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial, has been appointed to the Hauser Leaders Program at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, the school announced Tuesday.
Three other prominent political figures were also tapped for the program, including former Afghanistan Minister of Women’s Affairs Sima Samar, former U.S. Representative Jane M. Harman (D-Calif.), and Regis Pecos, the former governor of Cochití Pueblo. Over the semester, the four leaders will advise students, deliver guest lectures, and conduct research alongside HKS faculty.
“Some of our priorities through the program are bringing in leaders who are doing things that we hope that our graduates and alumni are doing when they go out into the world,” said Anastasia Trainque, assistant director for special programs at the Center for Public Leadership.
Incoming leaders said they look forward to sharing their expertise and collaborating with HKS students and faculty on pressing public issues.
Samar said she hopes to share her experiences and knowledge with “the future leaders of this planet” during her time at HKS.
An advocate for women’s rights in Afghanistan, Samar faced threats from her conservative colleagues who wished to silence her during her six-month tenure as Minister of Women’s Affairs. Samar was eventually forced to leave her post in 2003.
Using Afghanistan as a case study, Samar plans to lead several events on how reproductive rights are influenced by factors such as child marriage and religious extremism, according to Trainque.
“I think that it’s really important to pass the knowledge and that information and the truth to the younger generation everywhere,” Samar said. “The world is connected.”
“If in one corner there’s an injustice, it’s injustice everywhere,” she added.
Harman, who led a panel on the Electoral Count Act amendments last fall as a Hauser leader, said she is “delighted” to return for another semester.
“There is an environment at the Kennedy School where people in both parties can talk civilly to each other and can realize something that I think has always been true — which is that coming together to solve hard problems is the only way they really get solved,” she said.
“The Kennedy School functions a lot better than the U.S. Congress does at the moment,” Harman added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirty-two Muslim Harvard undergraduates embarked on the University’s second Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, over winter break — one of two religious pilgrimages within the Muslim faith.
Umrah is an optional pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of the year and involves a series of rituals in Mecca. The other — known as the “grand pilgrimage” or Hajj — is obligatory for Muslims to complete at least once in their lifetime, if they are able, and takes place on specific calendar days over the course of five to six days.
After Harvard organized its first Umrah trip in 2019, more than a dozen students who heard about the trip were eager to join in 2020. Due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the trip was canceled.
When the trip was rescheduled for January of this year, many students who intended to attend in 2020 quickly registered again.
Apart from three first-year students, the majority of undergraduates who attended the trip were juniors and seniors. Other Harvard affiliates joined the group for a total of 67 participants, including graduate students and family members of undergraduates.
Harvard Muslim Chaplains Khalil Abdur-Rashid and Samia Omar co-planned and co-led the pilgrimage.
A generous donation from a graduate of Harvard Business School and a parent of two current Harvard undergraduates allowed the University to offer the trip at no cost to first generation, low-income Muslim students. The donation for this year’s trip reportedly totaled approximately $100,000, according to Abdur-Rashid.
Omar said the significance of the Umrah in the Islamic faith makes the trip particularly meaningful for students.
“The journey is the dream of so many Muslims all over,” she said. “For the young students to be able to do so without really paying a lot of money, as they get supported from Harvard, this is something that changed their life.”
The group visited the city of Medina first and toured various historical sites in the city where the prophet Muhammad is buried, according to Omar. The group then took a train to Mecca, where they performed the actual rites and pilgrimage of the Umrah, she added.
Yousuf A. Bakshi ’23 described the trip as one of “the most memorable parts of my college experience so far.”
Thanks to Harvard’s global reputation, he added, the group gained access to several experiences that are normally closed off to the public. These included meeting with a member of the Saudi royal family, as well as the minister of Hajj and Umrah, and learning about how the world’s largest pilgrimage cities operate.
“Obviously, the Harvard name can get you some cool perks all around the world,” Bakshi said.
“I’m a low-income student, so for Harvard paying for me to go, basically, as part of financial aid, was just a really incredible opportunity,” he added. “I will always remember this the rest of my life.”
Tabish Soleman ’25 said the trip was a “very spiritually stimulating” experience and praised chaplain Abdur-Rashid for sharing his extensive knowledge of Islam.
“I was just honestly blown away by how much I learned solely just from sitting on the bus and listening to Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid just talk to us,” he said.
Abdur-Rashid lauded Harvard’s support of faith and religion on campus.
“The University has come leaps and bounds in the direction of more and more and more support for religious life in general for all faith traditions on campus, and I think that is a major change,” he said. “It’s a new Harvard.”
Clarification: January 29, 2023
This article has been updated to clarify that Khalil Abdur-Rashid and Samia Omar co-led and co-planned the University’s second Umrah pilgrimage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 240 people have emailed top Harvard administrators as of Thursday night to demand that the University fire John L. Comaroff — the embattled Harvard professor who returned to teaching this academic year after the school placed him on leave for violating its sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
The emails come after more than 100 students staged a walkout Tuesday from Comaroff’s class, African and African-American Studies 172X: “Colonialism and its Postcolonial/Decolonial Afterlives: Critical Readings.” As students gathered at the Barker Center, which houses his office, organizers encouraged everyone to take out their phones and send the email.
Comaroff, a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology, has been the subject of national controversy since an eight-month investigation by The Crimson in 2020 found that at least three female graduate students had filed complaints with Harvard’s Title IX office alleging he engaged in verbal and physical harassment and professional retaliation.
Following the allegations, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay placed Comaroff on paid administrative leave in August 2020. After a pair of internal investigations found that Comaroff’s verbal conduct violated Harvard’s policies around sexual and gender-based harassment and professional conduct, Gay placed him on unpaid administrative leave for the spring 2022 semester.
Upon his return to campus in fall 2022, Comaroff’s first class also elicited a walkout and student protest.
The emails — sent through an EveryAction form created by Rosalie P. Couture ’26, an organizer for the student activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better — call Comaroff a “known sexual abuser” and demand his immediate termination.
According to Couture, the emails are addressed to a slew of top Harvard administrators including Gay, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench, and Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana — as well as Comaroff himself.
“He is a danger to students,” the email script reads. “His employment creates a culture that accepts sexual violence on Harvard’s campus and globally. Harvard has a responsibility to protect its students and use its influence to create a more equitable, just, and safe world for all. We demand Comaroff is fired.”
The email script also says that Comaroff has “multiple well-documented allegations of sexual abuse from both UChicago and Harvard students.”
In February 2022, Anthropology graduate students Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava filed a federal lawsuit against Harvard alleging that the school repeatedly and continuously mishandled their complaints of alleged harassment and retaliation by the professor. The plaintiffs filed an amended suit in June 2022 detailing three more allegations of sexual harassment during Comaroff’s time as a professor at the University of Chicago.
In an emailed statement, Comaroff’s attorneys — Janet E. Halley, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, and Norman S. Zalkind — wrote that the claim that Comaroff was a sexual abuser was “simply false.”
The attorneys said allegations of sexual misconduct from the 2022 amended lawsuit were “completely untested, anonymous, and second-hand at best” and that no requests were ever made to investigate alleged misconduct at UChicago.
Comaroff’s legal team has consistently denied claims of sexual harassment against the professor and continues to highlight that the results of Harvard’s investigations did not confirm that Comaroff engaged in physical sexual harassment.
“The idea that Harvard would fire him based on unsupported allegations, ignoring the results of its own very thorough investigation, is disturbingly incompatible with basic values of fairness and due process,” they wrote.
“All members of the Harvard community should find that disturbing,” they added.
Annabelle J.L. Finlayson ’23, an organizer with Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she feels optimistic about the number of people who have used the form to send emails.
“The whole point of the email form was to help put pressure on administration, because obviously they’re not doing enough,” she said. “We are pretty excited about the number of people who have been interested.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the email campaign.
Our Harvard Can Do Better is planning another protest for next week.

Harvard students, staff, and faculty gathered on the steps of University Hall Thursday evening for a candlelight vigil to honor the victims — who were predominantly Asian and Asian American — of three shootings in California in the last week.
Attacks in Oakland and Half Moon Bay occurred on Jan. 23, while a shooting in Monterey Park occurred on Jan. 21, the eve of the Lunar New Year. In all, the shootings left 20 people dead and 14 injured.
Chinese immigrant farmer Chunli Zhao has been charged with seven counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the Half Moon Bay shooting. Huu Can Tran, an immigrant from China who California police suspected of killing 11 people in Monterey Park, was found dead after the shooting. Police are still investigating the Oakland shooting.
Jada Pisani Lee ’26 said hearing about the attack in Monterey Park was a “punch to the gut,” especially as she prepared for the Lunar New Year festivities with her family.
Pisani Lee, who is from San Mateo, California, said hearing about the subsequent shooting in neighboring Half Moon Bay was “a second punch I got right after the first one.”
Graduate School of Education student and vigil organizer Catherine G. Huang said that the loss “hits our Asian American and Pacific Islander community particularly hard.”
“The shootings happened the weekend of Lunar New Year and targeted members and elders from our AAPI community in California,” Huang said in a speech. “On a day and during a time when we should be celebrating with our communities, we are instead forced to learn how to mourn, process, and grieve the loss of life and safety.”
The vigil was intended as a space for people to “come together” and “recognize that this grief is real,” Huang said in an interview following the event.
“We have the right to take the time for ourselves. We have the right to grieve. We have the right to care for our mental health, especially when Harvard keeps moving and the world kind of keeps moving, too,” Huang said. “I just wanted to offer that space for those who might be seeking it.”
Huang said that she felt a “sense of frustration” over the “lack of a statement from Harvard even recognizing that this incident even happened.”
A University spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.
Margarita Rosa, a 2021 Advanced Leadership Initiative Fellow and a resident scholar at Adams House, emphasized the importance of solidarity with students of color.
“I thought it was very important to show support for the people affected, and it’s not only the Asian American community,” Rosa said in an interview after the vigil. “I think it’s all people of the faith, who really care about other humans and are grieving the most recent loss of members of our community.”
The vigil was followed by a space for support and solidarity hosted by the Harvard Foundation, where attendees and organizers reflected on the shootings and their grief.
Harvard Kennedy School student Jonathan Loc, who grew up just one mile from Monterey Park, said he attended the vigil because he “wanted to pay respects in some way.”
“I knew that probably other people like me are from that area or identify in some way with the community and are looking for support, and I’m looking for support,” Loc said. “It just helps to be together and to support each other.”
Loc also said that “it feels especially difficult this time” because the Monterey Park shooter was himself Asian.
“I think it’s important to rely on one another, to seek help from one another, and also to destigmatize seeking mental health care or even just counseling in general,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ushering in the Year of the Rabbit, student groups across campus celebrated Lunar New Year with plans of banquets and dinners in the near future.
This year, the Lunar New Year fell on Jan. 22 — the day before spring semester classes began. Through their celebrations, affinity groups and some upperclassman houses hoped to bring the feeling of home to Harvard.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association will host their annual Lunar New Year banquet next Friday, featuring performances from the Harvard Taekwondo Club, a traditional lion dance, and a multicourse family-style dinner.
Christy Zheng ’25, co-president of the Chinese Students Association, said she was “excited to bring everyone back together again.”
“Lunar New Year is just such an important holiday to the Asian community, and normally, we would be at home celebrating with our families,” she said. “But since we’re at college, we wanted to create a space where people could come and celebrate with their friends and still have the big feast and performances that they might have at home.”
“Lunar New Year as a holiday is just the most important, and it’s a symbol of growth and renewal — just like the new year,” she added. “And so we wanted to make sure that there’s a space to celebrate that.”
Amy Huang ’24, another co-president of the Chinese Students Association, said it is important for students to celebrate with others during the Lunar New Year.
“I think it’s really important to a lot of people here — a lot of students — to be surrounded by that community,” she said.
Henry Kuo ’23, co-president of the Harvard Taiwanese Cultural Society, said the organization plans to hold a dinner gathering in the next few weeks to celebrate Lunar New Year.
“It’s to bring together people in a community,” Kuo said. “I think people bond through eating.”
Kuo described Lunar New Year in Taiwan as a time for families to get together and see relatives they have not visited in the past year.
“This is probably the only time when everyone is on holiday,” Kuo said. “It’s kind of like Christmas in Taiwan — and everyone would go and visit their grandparents and eat together, have fun together.”
“It’s more of a family gathering for us — for TCS,” he added.
On Thursday, the Harvard Vietnamese Association hosted a Vietnamese New Year celebration — Tết — in the Lowell House dining hall. The event featured traditional food, as well as music and games.
Anna G. Luong ’25 said she attended the event because she found it difficult being away from family for the New Year.
“I think — especially being away from home and being away from family — having a little bit of an experience of what at home would be called Tết with my peers is what really drew me to this event,” she said.
“Also, they have amazing Vietnamese food,” Luong added.
Luong said that her appreciation for Lunar New Year has deepened as she has grown older.
“In the past, I would have said, ‘Oh, it’s a means of getting some extra money throughout the year,’” she said. “But now that I’m older, it really symbolizes for me appreciating my family and being able to grow up a little bit — sit at the adults’ table and talk to them, let everyone know how I’m doing, and staying in touch.”
Ethan N. Phan ’25 — social chair of HVA — said he enjoys HVA events because they feel “a little bit like being at home.”
“I really miss home and I miss my family,” he said. “And going to the Vietnamese events really feels kind of comforting and reminds me of home. It makes Harvard feel more like a welcoming space.”

The family of Luke Z. Tang ’18, a Harvard undergraduate who died by suicide in 2015, has appealed the December dismissal of a wrongful death lawsuit which alleges the University and two residential deans were negligent in their care of Tang.
Filed in 2018 by Tang’s father, the complaint accuses the defendants — Harvard itself, Senior Resident Dean Catherine R. Shapiro, former Lowell House Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03, and Counseling and Mental Health Services employee Melanie G. Northrop — of “negligence and carelessness” resulting in Tang’s death.
Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Brent A. Tingle heard the case on Nov. 1. Last month, he dismissed claims against Harvard, Shapiro, and Casey, writing that the parties sufficiently satisfied their duty of care to Tang following an initial suicide attempt in spring 2015.
The appeal, which was filed in the Massachusetts Appeals Court on Jan. 19, argues that because Harvard and its deans were aware of Tang’s previous suicide attempt, they carried an “affirmative duty” to Tang which did not cease until a medical professional declared he was no longer at risk of suicide. The appeal argues the court “erroneously made a factual finding” that Harvard did not owe Tang care.
“The non-clinician has an affirmative duty to make sure the at-risk student is receiving the ‘comprehensive coordinated’ care he/she needs regardless of the student’s words or actions,” the filing reads.
According to the filing, the College — by requiring Tang to enter into a “care contract” and providing mental health services through HUHS — “assumed a duty of reasonable care” to Tang. This duty renders Harvard liable for harm due to a failure to provide this care for Tang, it claims.
“No one at Harvard did anything affirmatively to make sure Luke was receiving the treatment it knew he needed and required him to have,” the filing reads.
David W. Heinlein, the attorney representing Tang’s family in the suit, could not be immediately reached for comment following the appeal.
Both the original complaints and arguments made in the appeal by Tang’s family are built on precedent originating from Nguyen v. MIT, a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case concerning a student suicide on MIT’s campus in 2009.
The ruling in that case established specific conditions in which universities can be held legally responsible for a student’s suicide, including the student informing university officials of suicidal ideation or past suicide attempts.
Heinlein’s appeal explicitly references the precedent set in Nguyen v. MIT.
“Despite the controlling mandate of Nguyen, and the factors of this case which indisputably give rise to a duty of case under it, the Superior Court — in an almost unheard-of fashion given the applicable standard of review — granted summary judgment to the defendants on the issue of breach of duty — an element of the claim that must be considered by the jury,” the appeal reads.
The filing also argues that the University still owed a duty of care to Tang even after he “continually denied” to officials that he was still suicidal.
“One known suicide attempt is enough to trigger the affirmative duty,” the filing reads. “What is absent from the record is any evidence that a medical professional opined that Luke was no longer at risk of death by suicide or that Luke no longer required counseling.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the appeal.
In November 2022, Tingle allowed claims in the suit against CAMHS employee Northrop, who served as Tang’s case manager after his suicide attempt, to proceed. Her case will go to a jury trial if it is not settled out of court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Turnpike realignment effort in Allston has hit a temporary roadblock following the U.S. Department of Transportation’s rejection of a request from the city and state for $1.2 billion to help fund the $2 billion project.
The state had aimed to begin construction in late 2022 or early 2023, though the project was first introduced almost a decade ago in 2014. Without a clear source of funding for the project, however, its timeline will likely be pushed back.
As it stands, the major strip of highway runs parallel to the Charles River before taking an above-ground detour as it bisects the neighborhood of Allston.
The area subject to construction is called the Throat, because it funnels train tracks and 12 lanes of highway through a small strip of land by elevating some of the lanes above Soldiers Field Road. Currently, the highway circumvents a large plot of land now owned by Harvard, but under the proposed construction, the road would cut directly through Harvard’s property.
Allston residents and drivers on the Mass. Pike said they widely support the realignment in principle.
“No one likes what’s there now,” said Allston resident Harry E. Mattison. “What’s there now is a massive unused parcel in a very prime location.”
Despite the potential of the project to bring new development to Allston, including a commuter rail station, the rejection did not come as a shock to government officials and residents.
“I don’t think we were surprised that we got turned down the first time,” said Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civics Association and a Harvard-Allston Task Force member.
“There are still things that need to be worked on and the design needs to be refined even more,” he added.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07, who discussed the funding rejection on Radio Boston Monday, explained her tempered expectations for the initial application.
“Many of the projects ahead of us in the queue were further along in their design and planning and had been in the application process for a long time,” she said. “We’ll keep going.”
Despite strong support from the city and state, however, the environmental advocacy group Charles River Watershed Association remains opposed to the project’s current form.
In December, the group said in a statement that they oppose the current plan because it would push construction and traffic up against the Charles, bringing increased pollution, heightening flood risk, and adversely impacting river health.
Emily Norton, executive director of the CRWA, said the funding request’s rejection marks an opportunity to discuss lane reduction.
“It’s 2023. We should not be building 12 lanes of roadway on the banks of the Charles River,” she said.
CRWA Deputy Director of Advocacy Jennifer Ryan wrote in an email that the current design would be detrimental to the city’s sustainability goals.
“MassDOT’s current at-grade proposal doubles down on failed 20th century highway design — reenforcing dependence on cars, taking us further from our climate goals, and continuing to pollute both Allston and the Charles River,” Ryan wrote.
In an emailed statement, a Boston city spokesperson wrote the city believes the project still holds potential due to improvements it could provide for public transportation, city infrastructure, and housing and job opportunities.
The spokesperson said Boston remains committed to working with the state, Allston, Harvard, and the federal government to design and finance the project.
In May 2022, then-University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ’04, a former Crimson editor, in support of the project.
“Alongside other stakeholders and members of the community, Harvard shares a vision for the Project that will advance mobility, connectivity, and regional economic growth while also addressing civic and community needs across Allston-Brighton,” the letter reads.

From the moment she finished her Ph.D. in Government at Harvard nearly 25 years ago, Claudine Gay was one of the most sought-after young scholars in the country.
Jennifer L. Hochschild, a Princeton politics professor at the time, recalled trying to recruit Gay to the university — only to have Gay choose Stanford instead, where she attained tenure in just five years.
After coming to Harvard, Hochschild got a second chance to persuade Gay to work with her in 2006, when she served on another search committee seeking to hire Gay.
This time, Hochschild succeeded.
Since then, Gay has had a meteoric rise through Harvard’s administration. Within a decade, she was tapped as dean of Social Sciences. Three years later, she was appointed dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Less than five years after that, on Dec. 15, 2022, Gay was selected as the 30th University president.
Gay, 52, will make history on July 1, when she will become the first person of color and only the second woman to lead America’s oldest institution of higher education. But despite Gay’s historic appointment, many of her colleagues and friends say they were unsurprised by her selection to Harvard’s top post.
In many ways, Gay is an insider in the elite academic world, having walked the halls of some of the nation’s most prestigious institutions: Phillips Exeter Academy for high school, Princeton and Stanford for college, and Harvard for graduate school.
The daughter of Haitian immigrants, Gay was born and raised in New York with her older brother, Sony Gay Jr. After attending the City College of New York, her mother became a registered nurse and her father a civil engineer.
Gay also grew up in Saudi Arabia, where her father, Sony Gay Sr., worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Gay later moved back to the U.S. where she lived in Georgia and Colorado, before attending the elite preparatory high school Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire.
Roxane Gay, Claudine Gay’s first cousin, said she believes the experience of growing up in several countries and cities prepared her cousin for a career of adjusting to new circumstances and challenges.
“When you live abroad you have to learn how to navigate other cultures and you have to learn how to not necessarily assimilate, but adapt,” Roxane Gay said. “If you do that from an early age, that enables you to be able to thrive in almost any situation.”
At Exeter, Claudine Gay competed on the women’s track team and served as director of circulation for the school’s newspaper, the Exonian, before graduating from the school in 1988. Her cousin, Roxane Gay, also attended the school, graduating in 1992. Claudine Gay currently serves as a trustee at Phillips Exeter.
Roxane Gay said her cousin is still the same as her younger self: “Very resolute and badass and confident of her place in the world.”
Claudine Gay first enrolled in Princeton University as an undergraduate, but she transferred to Stanford after her freshman year because she needed a change, according to a 1989 article in the Stanford Daily.
“Princeton is cold, traditional and austere. Stanford has a much more nurturing, humane environment,” Gay told the Stanford Daily. “Everybody at Princeton was already middle-aged. At Stanford people are working but still seem to be having a really good time.”
Gay majored in economics at Stanford and also served as a resident assistant on the second floor of Kimball Hall, an undergraduate dormitory.
Angela E. Rickford and John R. Rickford, who served as Kimball Hall resident fellows at the time, said they received around 100 applications for the position of resident assistant before narrowing it down to 30 people.
During the interview process, the Rickfords individually evaluated each applicant with a letter grade. When they compared notes at the end, both realized they gave an A+ to only one person: Claudine Gay.
“She was outstanding from the beginning,” Angela Rickford said.
Angela Rickford said she remembered being nervous that Gay would decline their offer — despite Kimball Hall being a popular location for resident assistants — because she expected everyone would try to hire Gay.
“I remember saying to John, ‘I don’t think we will get her because if we both independently gave her an A+, then everybody else who is interviewing her is probably going to give her a high grade and she’ll end up having lots of options,’” she said. “But, lucky for us, she did choose us.”
Gay graduated from Stanford in 1992, winning the Anna Laura Myers Prize for best senior thesis in the economics department. She moved to Harvard for graduate school and completed her Ph.D. in 1998, receiving the Toppan Prize for best political science dissertation.
Taking the podium where Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 had just announced her as the next president, Gay laughed, shook her head, and covered her mouth in disbelief. Gay, the otherwise formal and composed Harvard administrator, was visibly overwhelmed by emotion as she faced the cheering crowd who now recognized her as their future leader.
“This is crazy,” Gay said, laughing.
But many of Gay’s current and former colleagues disagree, pointing to her intellectual talent, leadership abilities, and personality.
Hochschild, who taught several Harvard seminar courses alongside the future president, said Gay’s talent was easily recognizable from the start.
“Since coming out of graduate school — which of course she did here — it’s just been real clear that she is just a very high quality person,” Hochschild said.
Barry R. Weingast, a professor of political science at Stanford, said that Gay stood out among her peers when she started teaching at Stanford University.
“She was not nervous as many assistant professors are,” Weingast said. “She knew where she was going. She knew what she needed to do.”
Gay received “early tenure” at Stanford after publishing several articles that gained widespread recognition before she was poached by Harvard in 2006, according to Weingast.
A scholar of political behavior, Gay has written numerous articles focusing on issues of race and politics in the United States. She has co-edited a book with Hochschild and two other scholars, but she has not authored a book.
“She just thinks very clearly,” Hochschild said. “She has the capacity to hone in on what really matters.”
Ariel White, a former graduate student in the Government Department, said Gay — the chair of her dissertation committee — was a “brilliant scholar” and someone she was lucky to work with.
“She always listens very attentively, and then she asks these very simple-sounding questions that get right to the heart of the matter,” she said. “That was the thing that made me realize, ‘Oh, this is the scholar who I want reading my work and reacting to it and making it better.’”
In 2015, former Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith tapped Gay to serve as dean of Social Sciences.
“Her name came up with lots of fantastic comments by many of her colleagues about the kinds of skills and actions that she’d already been doing simply as a faculty member within the Social Sciences,” he said.
Smith recalled being “severely impressed” by Gay during the hiring process and praised her diligence as dean.
“I loved working with her day in and day out on the issues that would come up,” he said. “When she would come to our meetings, she was always extremely well-prepared, understood the issues that we needed to be talking about when we had difficult problems.”
Three years later, Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow appointed Gay to succeed Smith as FAS dean.
“She is a scholar of uncommon creativity and rigor, with a strong working knowledge of the opportunities and challenges facing the FAS,” Bacow said in a July 2018 press release announcing her appointment. “She radiates a concern for others, and for how what we do here can help improve lives far beyond our walls.”
When Bacow announced in June 2022 that he would step down, Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey said he immediately knew who Bacow’s successor should be.
“My first thought was that Dean Gay should be our next president,” he said.
As Gay prepares to move from University Hall to Massachusetts Hall, colleagues said they expect intellectual and demographic diversity to be key items on her agenda.
Kelsey highlighted faculty appointments and curriculum changes as important issues for Gay’s tenure.
“She’s been really determined to ensure that we have the faculty we need to meet the challenges and to match the interests of a new generation,” he said. “I think she will continue to do that from Massachusetts Hall.”
During her time as dean of the FAS, Gay worked to bring more ethnic studies scholars to Harvard, hiring three ethnic studies professors last year. In an April 2022 interview, Gay said she supports the creation of an undergraduate concentration in ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration.
Taeku Lee, a Government professor who joined Harvard in 2022 as part of the ethnic studies cluser hire, wrote in an emailed statement that he joined Harvard in large part because of Gay’s “vision for and leadership on the Ethnicity, Indigeneity, and Migration initiative.”
“I am filled with hope for the University and, no surprise, for the future of ethnic studies by her selection as Harvard’s 30th president,” Lee wrote.
As president, Gay will also face a decades-old demand for an ethnic studies department.
Dean of the Social Sciences Lawrence D. Bobo said Gay “fundamentally has bought into the core aspirations” of the push for a department.
“She has worked very hard to build a faculty that is not only more intellectually diverse along these lines, but really demographically more diverse,” he said. “She will certainly, I would expect, continue that as a priority.”
Bobo said he would not be surprised to see the creation of an ethnic studies department during Gay’s tenure, but said that it is “not obvious” to him that a department is “the form it ought to take.”
“There are several options here,” he said. “I want people to be able to sit down and design it knowing that — if they reach consensus on a plan and lay out the intellectual case for it — knowing that they’re going to have a very receptive institutional leader in Claudine Gay.”
Gay also steered the FAS through several scandals related to sexual harassment during her tenure as dean.
In summer 2019, Gay stripped Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez of his emeritus status and disinvited him from the FAS campus after an investigation. Gay also suspended Economics professor Roland G. Fryer Jr., who faced accusations of sexually harassing co-workers. In 2021, the school reinstated Fryer’s teaching and research roles.
Following a 2020 Crimson investigation that uncovered allegations of sexual harassment in the Anthropology Department, Gay stripped professor Gary Urton of his emeritus status and sanctioned professor John L. Comaroff for violating the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Harvard faculty also praised Gay’s leadership of the FAS after the Covid-19 pandemic forced students to depart campus in March 2020.
Bobo pointed to a meeting in early March 2020 when Gay informed FAS leadership that campus would be closing and learning would shift online.
“She handled that meeting with extraordinary aplomb and confidence and planfulness,” Bobo said. “Over the months that followed, she exhibited what I can only regard as really exceptional clarity of purpose, steadiness at the helm, and exuded a real confidence that we were going to make a very difficult situation work.”
Kelsey agreed.
“She never seemed shaken by the pandemic and the challenges that it posed,” Kelsey said. “She kept the team together.”
Hochschild, who served as the Government Department chair for the first two years of Gay’s tenure as FAS dean, said Gay has “strong views.”
“She’s not shy about expressing them or about wanting to implement them when it was her job to make a decision in her role as dean,” Hochschild said. “But she’s very committed to participation in the process of reaching the right answer.”
Smith described Gay as a “straightforward” person who is “not playing any games.”
“She doesn’t feel the need to hide any aspects of herself, and I don’t see any reason why she would because she has so many strong attributes,” he said.
“You can’t push her around, and I think that’s a fantastic quality,” he added.
When moving into Haskins Hall as a first-year graduate student at Harvard, Gay brought the three things “that seemed most essential to my success at the time,” she said at the December press conference: “A futon, a Mac Classic II, and a cast iron skillet for frying plantains.”
Gay continued to share her love for cooking at Harvard several decades later as a professor.
Hochschild said that Gay would invite their whole class to her house at the end of every year.
“She was the one who organized it and brought in lots and lots of food and made sure that everybody was engaged and talking,” she said.
While Hochschild said Gay was funny and a “very good hostess,” Gay also maintained her classroom persona during these informal gatherings.
“She never loosened up a whole lot, or at least not in broad company,” Hochschild said.
Kelsey said Gay also enjoys going on runs and eating hot lunches, adding that she “does not like a cold buffet.”
White also praised Gay for being a “genuinely warm and caring” mentor despite her hectic schedule.
“She was getting pulled in a million directions,” White said. “But invariably, when I had a meeting on the calendar with her, and I got into her office, she had always read the thing that I had sent her. She had thoughtful comments on it.”
“During that time that we were meeting, it was like I was the only person she had to talk to that day,” White added.
With degrees from Exeter, Stanford, and Harvard, Gay’s ascension through the ranks of academia seemed almost inevitable. Her cousin, Roxane Gay, recognized this potential in Claudine Gay from a young age.
“I think she was always well-suited for academia,” Roxane Gay said. “She’s always been graciously curious and interested in how things work and how people work and how we can do the business of life better.”
Roxane Gay said she knew her cousin could reach the top in academia if she set her mind on it, adding that she can’t imagine a better person to serve as “the face and the heart of Harvard in the public sphere.”
Bobo said the presidential search committee made the right decision by far.
“I don’t think there was anybody else who was genuinely a close second,” he said. “This was very definitely the right outcome — and an exciting one.”
Roxane Gay also recognized the history behind her cousin’s selection.
“It’s always nice when institutions like Harvard that are so steeped in tradition and steeped in resisting change are able to move forward and be a part of the world as it is, instead of as it once was,” Roxane Gay added.
Lee, the first hire in Claudine Gay’s ethnic studies faculty search, wrote in an emailed statement that Gay is the president that the Harvard student body has “long awaited and rightly deserve.”
“We often tout our students as the future leaders of their communities and of the world, yet the example of far too many in positions of power today is deplorable and demoralizing,” Lee wrote. “So I am also filled with hope for our students, who can now take from Dean Gay as president a shining example of what ethical, impactful leadership can be.”
More than three decades later and thousands of miles away from where they once lived in Kimball Hall together, Angela Rickford said some of Gay’s characteristics have not changed.
“She’s just a winner,” Rickford said. “Always was.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a month-long pause for winter break, Harvard’s women’s ice hockey team (6-12-3, 5-8-3 ECAC) returned to campus seeking to refocus and breathe new life into a season that has not gone it's way thus far. Although the Crimson’s results in the win column were up-and-down, its performance on the ice was remarkably improved.
“I think our team is pretty focused,” head coach Katey Stone said. “We had boot camp, which we call two-a-days for a couple of days when they came back, and they were locked in. We have played some good hockey and haven’t gotten all the outcomes we wanted, but we are doing a lot of things better than the first semester.”
With no classes in session, the need for the usual Friday and Saturday game schedule is upended during the winter break. For Harvard, this translated to playing six games over the course of 14 days. Thus, finding the perfect balance between recovery and practice is essential to a team’s performance during winter break play.
“It was a lot of games, but at this point in the season, you want to be playing games,” said Stone about the slate of winter break contests.“Kids know what to do. We are just trying to sharpen our tools in practice and get going on game days.”
Following the matchup against Quinnipiac at Frozen Fenway, Harvard kicked off its return from winter break by traveling to Hobey Baker Rink on its 100th anniversary for a matchup against Princeton (9-10-1, 5-9-0). The Crimson’s offense came out firing on all cylinders: Harvard outshot the Tigers 11-10 in the first and 14-10 in the second. Great chances generated by first-year defender Jade Arnone and sophomore defender Mia Biotti almost opened the scoring in the second.
Princeton pushed the Crimson’s strong penalty kill to its breaking point in the third frame. A major penalty against sophomore forward Paige Lester and a minor against sophomore defender Jenna MacDonald set up a five-on-three advantage for the Tigers. While playing with the two-skater advantage, Issy Wunder scored off a redirect to give Princeton the edge. After Wunder’s opening goal, the Tigers got a boost from the 1500 fans packed into the arena. Wunder and Sarah Filler each added another goal to seal the 3-0 win.
Next, Harvard welcomed St. Lawrence (11-15-2, 5-7-2) to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for a 10:30 am puck drop. The Saints dominated the first period. After outshooting Princeton in the first period last time out, the Crimson was outshot 19-7 in the first. Along with the shot advantage, St. Lawrence led 1-0 after the first period. Aly McLeod scored seven minutes into the game with a shot that rocketed past sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci.
For the second straight contest, Harvard’s penalties led to a goal. In the second, the Saints jumped out to a two-goal lead as Kristina Bahl snuck the puck past Pellicci to capitalize on Arnone’s two-minute interference penalty. Not even a minute later, Biotti responded with a goal to cut the lead in half.
From just inside the blue line, Biotti launched a shot on goal that found its way into the back of the net. In the final minutes of the second, sophomore forward Hannah Chorske knotted the game up at two. After picking the pocket of a St. Lawrence defender, Chorske skated up the ice and beat the goalie with a quick shot. The game remained tied the rest of the way as the Crimson failed to convert on a third-period power play, and neither team was able to gain momentum in the overtime period.
The 800 sixth graders in attendance for the second annual education day hosted by Harvard Athletics spurred the Harvard comeback. The matchup also saw the emergence of sophomore forward Gabi Davidson Adams in the starting lineup. Davidson Adams has experienced an offensive explosion this year as she already has six more points than her last season total.
“She keeps getting better and better,” Stone said. “She makes the right play at the right time, and she is good around the net. We thought it was time for her to get an opportunity there, and I think she is a very good compliment to [senior forward Anne] Bloomer and [senior forward Kristin] Della Rovere.”
After the stalemate, the Crimson traveled to Hanover for a matchup against Dartmouth (6-15-0, 2-12-0). Following a scoreless first period where neither team had double digits shots, both offenses kicked into gear in the second.
The Big Green struck first as Lauren Messier fired a shot into the back of the net as she collided with the post. The fourth time was the charm for the Harvard power play as it converted on Dartmouth’s fourth penalty of the game late in the second. Bloomer tied the game at one by following up on a shot from Della Rovere.
The script of the third period was identical to the second. The Big Green regained the lead on a snipe by Jenna Donohue, and once again, the Crimson tied it up. Lester found the back of the net moments after the Dartmouth goal. For the second straight game, Harvard played an extra frame. However, this time the three-on-three play would go in the Crimson’s favor. Della Rovere took a perfect pass from Davidson Adams and guided it into the goal for the game-winner.
Looking to build upon its win against Dartmouth, Harvard faced Sacred Heart (13-13-1, 10-7-1 NEWHA) in a contest full of firsts. The matchup was the first in history between the two programs. The game was also the christening of the Martire Family Arena.
The Pioneers began scoring four minutes into the match as Delani MacKay beat Pellicci with a quick shot from the slot. Seconds later, Lester extended her goal streak to two games on a wraparound shot from behind the goal. In response to the fast-paced first, both goalies locked in for the second and third frames, combining for 50 saves the rest of the way.
In overtime, Sacred Heart secured the win with a breakaway goal. The game also included another milestone as Della Rovere moved into the NCAA lead for faceoff wins.
The Crimson concluded its winter break play with a homestand against RPI (7-18-1, 3-11-1 ECAC) and Union (11-14-1, 4-10-1). Halfway through the first, the Engineers were the first to light the lamp as Taylor Zahirnyi skated the puck all the way up the ice from her defensive zone before lacing a shot into the net from just inside the blue line. However, after the goal, it was all Harvard. Bloomer got the Crimson on the board late in the first with a shot that was deflected high into the air before bouncing awkwardly past the goaltender. Davidson Adams extended the lead with a score after using several fakes to get past several defenders. Junior forward Shannon Hollands scored an empty netter in the third to ice the game.
In the winter break finale against Union, Harvard scored the opening goal. The score marked Harvard’s first 1-0 lead since its November matchup with UNH. Sophomore forward Ellie Bayard gave the Crimson an early advantage with her third goal of the season. While Harvard dominated the first period, the Dutchwomen roared back in the second. This time the Crimson was on the wrong side of a 3-1 scoreline. Goals by Carmen Merlo and Emily King gave Union a 2-1 lead at the end of the second. Any hopes of a Harvard comeback faded as Riley Walsh scored an empty netter to close out the game.
As the season winds down and each game becomes more meaningful, the Crimson’s offensive focus will be finishing and converting shots into goals. Since returning, Harvard has outshot its opponents three times, matching the number from before the break. Additionally, Harvard is averaging north of 35 shots per game in its post-break contests.
“I think we have gotten some good ones as of late,” said Stone about the Crimson’s shot generation. “It’s just time for us to finish.”
The results over the break kept the Crimson at the middle of the ECAC table and in contention for a round one home playoff series. Harvard’s upcoming weekend series versus Cornell (12-7-2, 9-4-1) and Colgate (20-4-1, 10-3-0) has significant playoff implications. The Crimson currently sit in sixth place, nine points behind Cornell, which sits in 4th — the last seed to be awarded a home playoff series. Harvard will look to continue its high level of play and capitalize on its underdog status.
“We need to take the mentality of being the hunter and not the hunted,” Stone said. “The pressure is on everyone else.”
