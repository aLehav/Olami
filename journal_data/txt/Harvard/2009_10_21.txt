After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United Nations Security Council has chosen its next five non-permanent members, to begin serving next January in the body charged with global security. What Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Gabon, Lebanon, and Nigeria will accomplish in their two-year terms remains to be seen, but already clear is the dire need for systemic reform in the structure of the Security Council.
The Security Council exists to maintain the peace and security of the international community—no other UN body can impose mandatory decisions upon member states. With such responsibility, it makes sense that the great military powers of the world—the United States, China, and Russia—all hold permanent seats. The two-year inclusion of five other countries, however, demonstrates just how limited non-permanent members’ influence must be. Bosnia is a nation divided, barely functioning as a country. It must look inward to reviving its own government in addition to now presumably eyeing global security. Lebanon, for its part, currently has UN peacekeepers within its borders following Israel’s invasion in 2006—and only two days ago new Israeli spy devices from that war were found within its borders. On the council, these nations, and the other non-permanent nations, will not have veto power and will almost certainly be dominated by the same powers that have led power blocs within the UN since its conception.
Symbolic, useless two-year stints on the Security Council will not bring representation for much of the world. Expansion of permanent membership, however, would be a timely and productive measure to consider. Brazil, one of the new visiting members, would be an interesting choice to consider, as it exerts great strategic influence in South America, both militarily and environmentally (a growing global-security issue). Most clearly, however, Germany and Japan must be considered for permanent membership. The Security Council’s post-1945 composition obviously does not include those defeated Axis powers—Germany was not even one country for decades after the council formed. The geopolitical balance of the world, however, has changed since then. Germany is again a leader of Europe in population, economic clout, and—perhaps for a first time—peacekeeping efforts. When European Union peacekeeping troops are sent to an unstable state, German troops are likely to be involved. Why, then, leave this important world player out of global security? Similarly, Japan plays a critical role through its own economic influence and anti-missile defense systems. Neither country can be perceived as a threat to start wars in this century. Yet both would be valuable contributors in their prevention.
The Cold War’s geopolitics have passed, and the concept of a regional superpower is following on its heels. Simply leaving ultimate security to those nations that won the Second World War and positioned themselves to lead the United Nations in the 1950s does not make sense for this upcoming century. The Security Council, as the peacekeeping arm of that body, should similarly reflect the political landscape of the times.
Of course, shifting geopolitics will involve the United States, China, and Russia for at least many more decades. These nations should reconsider the permanent club of the Security Council that they control, though we acknowledge that reform may go against the immediate interests of these “Big Three.” We encourage these nations, however, to recognize the long-term benefits of voluntarily enacting a better, more adaptable council structure. Adding permanent members and restructuring will be easier the sooner it is begun.
Wrinkles face such reforms, most notably the veto question. Though we call for the expansion of permanent membership, we do not believe that new permanent members should automatically receive the veto vote currently held by all ten permanent members. Such weighty power of office should be granted to countries depending on their relative power and ability to intervene in world conflict. The veto helps keep major powers such as Russia from conducting military actions unilaterally against the other council members—new members to whom this condition applies would have to be considered for a veto vote.
Thus, while we congratulate the new non-permanent members for their upcoming stints on the Security Council, we call upon the permanent members to consider the difficult task of self-reform. Revising the Security Council now falls under their stated mandate, the long-term security of the global community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not often that a six-year-old can claim to be a spokesperson for education reform, but spokesperson is exactly what Zachary Christie of Newark, Del., has become. Over the past month, Christie has harshly criticized the unfairness of his school’s zero-tolerance policies, and for good reason—Christie himself was recently suspended from school for bringing in a Cub Scout tool that can be used as a knife, fork, or spoon. This seemingly innocuous item violated the district’s no-tolerance policy on weapons; Christie may now have to serve 45 days in reform school.
Zero-tolerance policies have always come under fire for being too strict. Christie’s case illustrates just why more flexibility may be necessary; the consequences seemed to far outstrip the crime. Indeed, although zero-tolerance policies are necessary measures for ensuring the safety of America’s schools, fairness requires that the punishments assigned for violating these policies be discretionary.
In Christie’s school district, the zero-tolerance policy is clear: Weapons are not allowed in school “regardless of possessor’s intent.” Although many have claimed that, in Christie’s case, intent should have been taken into account, the district’s injunction is an essential one in creating a secure school environment. When students bring knives or any other implements that can be used as weapons into school, they are engaging in inherently unsafe actions. Even if, as in Christie’s case, the weapon is innocently brought in out of excitement or pride, dangerous situations can result. Christie could have taken out the knife in anger during a fight, or another student could have stolen it from him; in both cases, his intent in bringing the weapon into school may have been completely innocent but still could have culminated in a risky situation. Zero-tolerance policies are necessary to keep students safe from any such contingencies; they cannot be invoked or revoked on the basis of the possessor’s intent or the specific conditions of the case.
Nevertheless, Christie’s parents and other members of the community are right to express outrage at the facts of the case. Christie is only six years old, and he brought the knife in because he wanted to show off his new Cub Scout tool at lunch. The rationale behind suspending him and potentially sentencing him to a month and a half in reform school seems highly questionable: Christie is not a student with violent or disruptive tendencies, so the question remains as to which aspects of his behavior need to be “reformed.”
While the suspension may have been justified, the only additional disciplinary measure merited by the case was to inform Christie of his school’s rules, since he has not shown any pattern of disobeying them once he understands them. In fact, sending Christie to reform school will likely achieve precisely the opposite effect desired, actually hindering his education by forcing him to miss 45 days of regular class instruction. Although violations of zero-tolerance policies should certainly be punished, the precise nature of the punishments applied needs to be discretionary to account for students’ intentions, personal situations, and, most importantly, educational needs or interests.
Christie’s case in Delaware is reflective of a dangerously increasing trend in school suspensions and zero-tolerance policies. Twelve percent of students in Baltimore schools were suspended during the 2006-2007 school year, and 40 percent of high-school freshmen in Milwaukee faced suspensions over the same period. Blanket applications of zero-tolerance policies and the suspensions or expulsions associated with them are keeping too many kids out of school unnecessarily. Administrators need to be constantly vigilant about how they apply these policies and discipline students—otherwise, safety in the educational environment will come at the cost of education itself.

T  he Boston winter is fast approaching, and the falling temperature is simply a delayed reminder of what is to come—the upcoming flu season. With sanitization stations dotting the campus, e-mails from deans reminding us to wash our hands with soap and water and sanitizer, and special rooms on campus quarantining sick students, we would be hard-pressed not to notice the particular attention paid to this year’s flu season, especially with the spread of the H1N1 flu.
Yet even with all these warnings, people still hesitate to use vaccines, given the results of a recent survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health in which 41 percent of adults say they will not get vaccinated for H1N1. This statistic may seem surprising, since vaccinations have long been considered a safe and effective means for preventing serious illnesses. There are reasons why, as a child, we get a host of vaccinations that prevent us from contracting diseases ranging from polio to rubella to, now, chicken pox. And while chicken pox may seem like just a rite of passage for children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that,  before the vaccine, more than 10,000 people were hospitalized and about 100 to 150 people died from chicken pox in the U.S. each year. While these vaccinations do not prevent all instances of their diseases, they do help prevent the occurrence of these diseases with minimal risks of side effects. With already more than a million people in the U.S. infected, you would think H1N1 vaccines would be an obvious choice.
Nevertheless, people will still refuse to get vaccinated, which will greatly increase their chances of contracting the virus. They can then become carriers who can contribute to the further spread of the disease. The resolve to avoid vaccination is bolstered by popular personalities like Glenn Beck, who said on his radio show that the vaccine could be “deadly,” and comedian Bill Maher, who on his Twitter feed called anyone who received the H1N1 vaccine an “idiot.” Regardless of the validity of these claims and the science that strongly indicates otherwise, do people have a right to make what may be an unhealthful decision?
In line with the government’s stance on recreational drugs, the State of New York attempted to say no—when it affected its health-care workers. Until a State Supreme Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, it was state policy to require all health-care workers to be vaccinated or risk losing their jobs. Still, the state’s health commissioner believes in the vaccination policy and will appeal the ruling. This mandate was intended not merely for the safety of health workers; it was primarily to ensure the safety of patients. The rationale is the following: Health workers interact with people who come to hospitals to treat illnesses. Unvaccinated workers greatly increase the chance  of passing on an illness to a patient, undermining the entire health facility.
While this intention is laudable, such a practice undermines important rights that we hold dear. First, how would we feel if we were forced to take a vaccine for a disease we do not usually get, but then get sick from the vaccine after the vaccine was intended to prevent sickness in the first place? This policy can implode if we see even minor side effects. Alongside these immediate health concerns, there are larger ideological arguments. How can the government decide what we put in our bodies? And with these mandates, do we open the door for the government to take more control in other matters? The government walks a fine line when it issues such forceful mandates—on the one side, there are the rights of the workers; on the other, the safety of patients.
With the health workers, regardless of how statistically safe these vaccinations are, there are relevant concerns with getting vaccinations. For example, the H1N1 vaccine packaged in a multidose vial contains the mercury compound thimersol, which though present in trace amounts, could still bother consumers. And there is the infamous case from 1976 when the vaccine used to treat swine flu was associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, causing paralysis in some patients. There are few data to provide conclusive evidence of causation, and scientists now assure us that the production of vaccines has greatly improved in the last 30 years, but consumers may still be worried. If the worker feels confident that the risks of contracting the diseases are not worth the supposed risks of the vaccines, they should not be mandated to take it.
With the patients, their safety needs to be taken into account. If some workers are not going to get vaccinated, patients should be informed about this and be given the choice to be treated by a vaccinated caregiver. Or maybe there are less invasive options for non-vaccinated caregivers, such as facemasks and gowns, which may prevent the spread of viruses. In a health-care facility, the care of patients is tantamount and must be the primary focus of the workers.
However ill-conceived people’s conceptions of vaccines may be, they should not be forced to take them for fear of losing their jobs. Though such a solution may require compromise, a mandatory H1N1 vaccine would be a step in the wrong direction. Unless such a vaccine is proven absolutely critical for the performance of their job, health workers’ right to choose must be protected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I approached my interview with Rachel Wagley, co-president of True Love Revolution, as an opportunity to rethink my perspective on TLR’s platform. Time allowing, I also hoped to track down the Harvard students whose “casual, liberationist sentiments toward sex, sexuality, and relationships” the group denounces. (For purely journalistic purposes, of course.) Unfortunately, the discussion fell short in both respects.
TLR describes itself as a student group whose mission is not only to “promot[e] abstinence,” but also to “focus...on objective truth, virtues, self-respect, the strength of morality, and upholding the community.” As an officer in the group, Wagley has ventured far outside her comfort zone, from Radcliffe Union of Students meetings at the Women’s Center (gasp!) to hour-long debates about abstinence, feminism, and homosexuality with editorial columnists. As little as she seemed to enjoy our chat, she stressed the importance of this type of outreach. “I of all people love passionate opinions on either side of the aisle. My only problem is people who are totally apathetic,” she claimed.
Luckily for Wagley, I am nothing if not passionate.
The core of TLR’s views is a condemnation of moral relativism, particularly with regard to sexual morality. “Really what’s been TLR’s mission from the beginning is a front against relativism in culture, and a front against the idea that there is no objective right and there is no objective wrong,” Wagley said.
On an individual level, this means proselytizing, presuming to know what type of behavior would make Harvard students happiest. In a post warning about the dangers of oral sex, for example, TLR’s blog interrogates its audience. “Do women feel better if a guy dumps her if she ‘only had oral sex’ with him? Isn’t that as emotionally damaging as if she had had ‘real’ sex with him?” I find this argument hard to swallow. While being dumped is less enjoyable than spending a Saturday night in Stillman (not that I would know), the underlying assumption is that engaging in sexual activity places a woman in a vulnerable and subservient position. When I argued that, while some women approach sex from this angle, others view the act as empowering, Wagley at first resisted and then changed the subject. “I do not think that legitimizes the hookup culture, because people can do it unemotionally. Because I think that [it] actually hurts people.”
How so? Funny you should ask. Wagley blamed what she termed “hook-up culture” for everything from high divorce rates to suicide, as I sat across from her silently having a seizure. At a particularly low point, she blamed promiscuity for sexual assault. “We’ve made sex so immensely available to men, so when you’re in a precarious position, the reason men don’t...respect women anymore...is because we’ve treated sex as a recreational activity that doesn’t mean anything.” The connections were shaky at best. The only statistics presented came from the conservative Heritage Foundation, relied upon self-reported measures of happiness, and ignored direction of causality and confounding variables like religion.
When asked to rely on ideological arguments instead of personal anecdotes or surveys, Wagley seemed incapable of doing so without reverting to inconsistent or illogical claims. She described TLR’s views as being in line with mainstream Americans’ but later claimed that the organization has been persecuted and stigmatized. She presented “sexual surrender” to one’s partner as a crucial part of the institution of marriage but acknowledged that sexual desire should not be a motivating factor in the decision to wed. And, in a particularly puzzling and drawn-out exercise, she asserted that traditional marriage, between a man and a woman, was “the best” way to live, but claimed not to believe that it was “better” than homosexual marriage.
So what’s TLR to do? Wagley was fond of comparing TLR to institutions like Queer Student Alliance, claiming that both groups promote alternative lifestyles. But there is a crucial difference—the QSA doesn’t demand that everyone become gay. One organization promotes tolerance; the other argues that its lifestyle is superior and should be adopted by others, who as it stands are objectifying themselves and their sexual partners, sullying the institution of marriage, and making rape socially acceptable. TLR ought to scale back its mission and become a forum where abstinent students can find comfort and support. But when it comes to a group that simultaneously cites arguments while questioning their relevance—and advocates for one lifestyle while refusing to address the perceived flaws of others—apathy is preferable to ignorant intolerance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time ever, and just two weeks before the Cambridge Public School Committee Elections, the Cambridge public school district has been labeled “in need of improvement” due to the results of last spring’s Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) testing.
The MCAS are annual achievement tests administered in Math and Language Arts to third through tenth graders, and in Science in grades five, eight, and ten.
Districts that do not meet the Math and English Language Arts targets for their states two years in a row, or their individual improvement targets based on the school’s prior year’s performance, are labeled as needing improvement.
For the second consecutive year, the Cambridge district’s test scores fell below the state target.
The city was 10.1 points below the 84.3 Massachusetts state target composite performance index for Math and 6.8 points below the 90.2 state target composite performance index for English Language Arts.
Despite the fact that the district spends $25,000 on each student, more than almost any other district in Massachusetts, Cambridge students performed below the state average. The district scored 4.3 points below the state average in Math, with a composite performance index of 74.2, and 3.1 points below the state average in English Language Arts, with a composite performance index of 83.4.
Additionally, the achievement gap—a nationally-seen disparity in the test scores of white and minority students—was particularly salient in the results. Overall, the composite performance index in both subjects for White and Asian students was actually higher than the state average, but Black, Hispanic, and low income students all fell far below the state average.
While 62 percent of White 7th graders in the district were proficient or advanced in math, only 18 percent of Black students were, and while 79 percent of White 7th graders were proficient or advanced in English Language Arts, only 44 percent of Black students met or exceeded standards.
Not surprisingly, school committee members were not pleased with the results of the MCAS.
Committee member Patrica M. Nolan ’80 called the results “devastating.” “We have to get our scores up as a district,” she said.
However, the committee members saw the MCAS as an imperfect measure.
“We need to take it in context,” said school committee member Marc C. McGovern. “They are one measure—an important one—but they don’t tell the whole story.”
Regardless, committee members said they felt that a system that holds teachers more accountable while supporting professional growth is necessary.
Specifically, an MCAS and Adequate Yearly Progress Report released last night outlined measures for improving teaching and learning strategies.
One suggestion included partnering with Harvard “to identify promising practices that are effectively narrowing the gap in student performance.”
Ultimately, McGovern offered an optimistic perspective.
“What we are committed to is a well-rounded, exciting, enriching curriculum and we should not be distressed by the results,” he said.

A small group of alumni from the Harvard Class of 1969 renewed its criticism of compensation paid to University endowment managers in a letter sent to President Drew G. Faust yesterday, citing the nearly 30 percent investment loss sustained this past year.
“This unprecedented loss is treated as a rather small blip on a generally upward curve, giving us little confidence that Harvard is addressing the scope and nature of the current problems,” the nine alumni wrote. They said that the University’s annual financial report, which was released on Friday, “fail[ed] to acknowledge any fundamental mistakes or to suggest any major changes in the way the endowment is managed.”
The group, which has long condemned Harvard Management Company for paying what it says are exorbitant bonuses, called on Harvard to report how much of that money has been retracted after the endowment’s recent underperformance. According to HMC’s policies, which emphasize sustained, long-term growth, internal investment managers are awarded bonuses if they grow the value of the endowment above benchmarks set by the HMC Board, but those bonuses can be retracted in later years if the fund underperforms benchmarks.
A “substantial number” of portfolio managers had bonuses “clawed back” last year, Harvard’s financial report noted, but a small group of managers retained bonuses and even earned additional compensation.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to provide further details on the compensation retractions.
In 2008, compensation for HMC’s president and top five officials totaled $26.8 million. In 2003, when managers were paid $107.5 million, many of the same alumni issued sharp protestations—which reportedly disgruntled many HMC managers and motivated them to leave Harvard to found private firms.
David Kaiser ’69, who signed the letter to Faust, emphasized in an interview with The Crimson that the global financial crisis has exposed fundamental flaws in the aggressive strategies used by investors around the world. He acknowledged that HMC has for years delivered spectacular endowment growth, but said that the drastic budget cutbacks now plaguing the University illustrated the need for “slower but more sustainable rates of growth.”
Harvard, which currently manages 30 percent of its funds internally and uses external investors to oversee the rest, says that its investment model allows it to achieve extraordinary growth at a fraction of the cost of hiring comparable outside managers. Nevertheless, Kaiser emphasized the need for lower compensation—even if it means that Harvard is forced to abandon the successful but arguably risky investment strategies that have served it well in the past.
“The managers of the Harvard Endowment...shared—indeed, led the way—in many of the practices that have brought us all to this pass,” the alumni letter said. “We think Harvard University can now take the lead in finding a way out, if it chooses to do so.”

Former Crimson President Stephen R. Barnett ’57, a First Amendment professor emeritus at the UC Berkeley School of Law, died last Tuesday after complications from a cardiac arrest. He was 73.
Colleagues remember the prominent critic of the California state court system as a “mainstream gadfly,” who frequently dissented at the law school’s faculty meetings.
“He was not afraid of controversy in a way that most of his colleagues understood and usually appreciated,” said Berkeley law school professor Richard M. Buxbaum, who had known Barnett for 40 years.
Since he joined the law school faculty in 1967, Barnett was known to champion the freedom of the press and to levy harsh criticisms against the California Supreme Court’s decision making process.
But details of Barnett’s professional pursuits often escaped Karine, his wife of eight years, who said she had not known about the bulk of his accomplishments until she read his obituaries. Karine recalled a different Steve—a peaceful and quiet presence in the home.
“He was very shy, very humble, very private,” Karine said. “He wasn’t very talkative. You could hardly get even an ‘I love you’ from him.”
Barnett would often be completely absorbed in his work that he brought home, Karine recalled, sometimes not realizing his son was trying to talk to him.
But Barnett’s professional experience proved to be influential in his stepson’s recent decision to study criminal justice, Karine said.
Despite Barnett’s reserved demeanor with his family, colleagues and former students remember his sharp wit and engaging conversations.
“Some professors are extremely warm and fuzzy,” said Jess Bravin ’87, Supreme Court correspondent for the Wall Street Journal and former Crimson editor. “He was a sardonic, somewhat irascible character ... [but] very accessible, and quite concerned with students.”
Barnett once told his class of first-year students to “grow up” so they could face the often gruesome issues they would likely be dealing with in litigation.
Born on Dec. 25, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, Barnett was raised in West Hartford, Conn. and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College, where he was president of the Harvard Crimson for only two months. The College asked him to step down after he was caught sneaking his girlfriend through a tunnel from his dormitory past the 8 p.m. curfew.
Barnett graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1962 and later clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
Longtime friend and former president of the California State Bar Jeff Bleich said he would miss the unmistakable twinkle in Barnett’s eyes when catching others off guard in the middle of a debate.
“He loved causes, and he didn’t let go of them easily,” Bleich said. “He was always willing to poke at sacred cows.”
Barnett is survived by his wife, Karine, their son, Alexander, 5, and his stepson, Levon, 23.

Cambridge may be in for one of the coldest winters of this past decade, the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center reports, and students were pleased to find out last week that budget cuts at the College have left the annual freshman “coat fund” untouched.
College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds sent 300 freshman an e-mail Thursday—a few days before Sunday’s sudden snowfall—informing them of their eligibility for the annual coat fund, which allows students to purchase or be reimbursed for $100 worth of winter gear.
This figure has not changed since last year, though students were awarded twice the amount in 2007.
“We hope this ‘winter coat grant’ positively contributes to your experience at the College and makes your time in Cambridge a little warmer and happier,” Hammonds wrote in the e-mail.
The unusually cold and snowy weather in store for this winter is caused an abnormally weak El Niño, a warming current in the Pacific Ocean that is can be used to predict weather patterns, according to the National Weather Service’s website. Strong El Niño currents are often correlated with warmer-than-average winters in the New England region.
In the past, the Harvard College Financial Aid Office and the Freshman Dean’s Office set aside these funds primarily for students who come from warmer climate areas, though Financial Aid Director Sally C. Donahue said that all freshmen who demonstrated significant financial need this year were eligible for the program.
Last weekend’s snow flurries caught many by surprise, though temperatures are expected to be back up temporarily in the high 50s to low 60s next week.
“I thought it was really fun, but I wasn’t quite mentally prepared for it yet,” said Stephanie E. Herwatt ’13, a native of Napa, California.

The sexist portrayal of women politicians in the media is “not just a right wing thing” but a problem spanning across the ideological spectrum, said former President of National Organization of Women (NOW) Kim Gandy in a forum held last night in Emerson Hall.
The event—hosted by the Harvard College Women’s Center—featured the screening of television video clips followed by Gandy’s commentary and an interactive discussion between the current Kennedy School Institute of Politics fellow and  audience members.
Gandy called attention to the apparent double standard that exists in the media’s treatment of women either running for or serving in public office, with the majority of the night’s conversation  focused on Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential primary elections.
“I did not expect such a degree of sexism to happen in the context of elections for the U.S. presidency,” Gandy said. “Here, people are running for the most powerful office in the world and I did not think that they would stoop down to this almost grade-school level name calling.”
Gandy pointed to the disparity of subject matter in criticism that Clinton faced in comparison to male politicians, citing the media’s repeated references throughout the election season to Clinton’s hair, voice, figure, and clothing.
Gandy further noted that Clinton’s general characterization in the media as “ambitious and calculating” carried a negative sentiment that would never have been applied to her male counterparts, Barack Obama or John McCain.
“If you run for president, you are, by definition ambitious, and yet for women that is somehow an unattractive quality,” Gandy said.
She also cited the usage of specific diction in characterizing Clinton’s laugh and voice, including the denotation of Clinton being “cackling” and “shrill” as “completely gendered terms,” asking the audience when a man has ever been described as “shrill.”
“Gender in politics is something I’ve been aware for a while but hearing Kim talk about it really opened up my eyes,” forum attendee Matthews K. Mmopi ’11 said. “Here are these people who are supposed to be well-respected voices in the media and yet they can get away with so much.”
Gandy said the most effective way to spearhead change was to contact media outlets directly, adding that individual letters or e-mails carry more weight than mass petitions.
“You have to keep pointing it out but networks do respond and eventually get the message,” she said.
Women’s Center intern and event coordinator Kelsey B. LeBuffe ’10 said she hoped that the forum was to able to raise a general awareness about sexism in politics.
“It’s something that people talk about individually but doesn’t always get the coverage it needs publicly,” LeBuffe said.

The No. 9 Harvard men’s soccer team earned its second consecutive win Wednesday afternoon by aptly applying the idiom, “better late than never,” to its performance at Providence University.
Seniors Desmond Mitchell and Andre Akpan scored two late goals to pull out a 2-1 victory for the Crimson, who improved to 10-2-1 (2-0-1 Ivy) on the season. After defeating Brown 1-0 at home on Saturday, the team picked up another win against a Rhode Island team by knocking off the Friars, who fell to 5-6-3 (2-4-2 Big East) on the year.
Whereas Harvard scored early in the second half against Brown and never looked back, the squad had to wait until the final minutes of yesterday’s game to pull ahead.
The match was scoreless until the 88-minute mark of the second half, when Mitchell scored his third goal of the season from seven yards out.
Mitchell, who only played 49 minutes total, had entered the game just three minutes before his goal.
“Adam Rousmaniere took the ball down the line and had a great cross in. I was able to get across my defender and hit it into the goal,” Mitchell said.
But the Friars struck right back with a goal on a redirection by midfielder Marc Cintron with just 27 seconds remaining in regulation.
For Cintron, a freshman, it was his first career goal. He scored it after sophomore John Raley drove the ball into the 18-yard box. Cintron found the pass and redirected the ball from five yards out past Crimson sophomore goalie Austin Harms.
Just thirteen seconds later, Harvard was awarded a penalty kick after the Friars were whistled for a foul inside the box. The Crimson turned to its star, reigning Ivy League Player of the Week, Akpan, who placed the ball into the low right corner of the net past diving Providence goalie Timothy Murray to seal the victory.
Akpan’s goal, which came with just 14 seconds remaining, was his team-best ninth of the year.
Compared to the back-and-forth exciting final moments, the rest of the game was more cat-and-mouse, with great goaltending and defense on both sides.
“I think we were playing great offensively, we just weren’t making that final pass,” Mitchell explained. “Our buildup was great, we just weren’t able to complete the play.”
His coach felt the same way.
“One thing that let us down early was we got into wide areas, but didn’t deliver balls that we could score off of,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said.
The Friars held a 6-4 edge in shots in the first half, but were unable to score against Harms, who has rebounded nicely by giving up just one goal in two games after giving up four at Connecticut last week.
“This week he’s back at his normal; the one today he had no chance on,” Clark said. “I think he’s only let in one tough goal all season.”
Though Harvard was only able to muster two shots on goal the entire game, the team made them both count.
Providence, on the other hand, was able to get off three shots on goal. Both unsuccessful attempts were headers saved by Harms.
Clark explained that he was particularly pleased with the play of players such as Mitchell and Rousmaniere.
“When we’re getting points out of those guys, we’re doing very well,” Clark said. “We can’t count on other guys like Andre and Brian [Grimm] to score us goals every game.”
He explained that Harvard is only an elite team when they, “get [production] from other areas.”
Despite the victory, Harvard was outshot 10-7 and lost the corner kick battle 5-2. But Clark said this did not particularly bother him.
“They were a counterattacking team, transitioned well, [and] took some shots,” he explained. “Statistics are a funny thing...it’s about how many real chances you make.”
The Crimson certainly made the most of its chances in this game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With ten minutes left in yesterday’s Harvard-Yale women’s soccer game, the Bulldogs snuck a shot past senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann.
But, right before the ball crossed the goal line, Crimson junior defender Katie Kuzma made a crucial sliding stop. The play helped secure Harvard’s (7-5-1, 4-0 Ivy) exciting 3-2 victory over Yale (8-5, 3-1 Ivy). The win in New Haven also maintained the Crimson’s perfect league record.
“It’s one of the top ten games I’ve ever seen,” Harvard Coach Ray Leone said after the match.
That is not a small accomplishment considering Leone has coached at the collegiate level since 1986.
The players agreed with their coach’s excitement.
“It was a great game—a typical Harvard-Yale game,” senior co-captain Lizzy Nichols said.
The Crimson started the game strong, opening with a goal 29 minutes into the first half.
Junior co-captain Gina Wideroff scored for the second time this season off a long pass from Kuzma, who was able to bypass the Bulldogs’ back line with the ball. Harvard kept the Yale defense on its toes, recording four shots in the half—all on goal.
Going into the break, the Crimson felt good about its play.
“I think we had a really good first half,” Nichols said. “We got a goal early that let us feel good going into halftime with some confidence and the momentum.”
At the start of the second half, the Bulldogs came out with powerful play and established a lead barely ten minutes into the period.
“We looked stronger in the first half,” Leone said. “But [Yale] responded and dominated for a long time in the second half.”
Bulldogs’ forward Miyuki Hino scored off a header to tie the game, and her teammate Becky Brown put away a loose ball to give Yale a 2-1 edge with 38 minutes remaining.
But Harvard did not let its opponent get too far ahead.
“We bent, but we didn’t break,” Leone said.
Crimson sophomore Patricia Yao entered the game later in the second half and quickly made her mark with a tap-in goal off an assist by freshman Alexandra Conigliaro to make it an even match.
“[Yao] came off the bench and scored right away,” Nichols said. “It’s the definition of a superstar to come off the bench and contribute like that.”
Harvard reclaimed its lead just seven minutes later with sophomore Melanie Baskind’s goal off of a deflected pass by junior teammate Katherine Sheeleigh. This kind of composure was what made a road win possible.
“It was a bit of back-and-forth,” Nichols said of the latter part of the game. “But we were persistent and I’m really proud of the way our team responded.”
With a little over ten minutes left in regulation play, the Bulldogs set out to prove that no game is finished until the final whistle blows. Yale’s Kristin Forster managed to get a shot past Mann and it looked like the teams would be even again. But Kuzma, who is also a Crimson sports editor, slid into the net to stop the ball from crossing the plane into the goal.
“The difference was that stop on the line,” Leone said. “Otherwise it’s a 3-3 tie game and we’re going into overtime.”
Harvard kept its play strong and preserved its 3-2 lead to give the Bulldogs its first Ivy League loss in one of the best games of the season.
“Both teams played well, [and] all five goals were awesome,” Leone said. “Both of us tried to work our strengths, and it came down to us being able to put the ball in the back of the net one more time than them.”
The Crimson will defend its first place position and undefeated status in the Ivy League this Saturday against the Princeton Tigers at 11 a.m. at Ohiri Field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Athletes are admired for the sacrifices they make for their sports—they wake up early to go to the gym, they force themselves through painful conditioning, and they spend hours practicing when they could be doing something more fun.
But rarely does someone sacrifice something as basic as sleep.
Harvard junior Richard Hill, of the men’s varsity squash team, did just that, going nearly seven months without sleeping for more than two hours at a time.
Hill is Singaporean, and in 2005, after high school, he joined the Singapore Armed Forces to serve the mandatory two-year tour.
An avid squash player from a squash-loving family, Hill at first found himself unable to practice his sport except on weekends.
After nine months, when his basic training was complete, Hill became an infantry sergeant and was posted to the Field Defense Squadron at an air base.
At this point, he negotiated a deal with his superiors, in which he was allowed to leave the base from 3 p.m. to midnight to attend squash National Training.
This leave essentially counted as his shift off, and in exchange for it Hill was forced to be on duty from midnight to 6 a.m., and active for the rest of the day until 3 p.m.
So when did Hill sleep?
He slept, he reveals, when he was on duty. Stationed at night at the base, Hill was in charge of distributing and taking back ammunition at every change of guard. The guard changed every two hours, so Hill slept on a bed in his office for three two-hour increments each night.
Catching up on sleep later was not an option either. Hill slept in this manner five days a week, for nearly seven months straight.
“I had to do my job along with the rest of the squadron,” Hill explains. “But managed to work something out with my superior officers.”
Due to his dedication, Hill represented Singapore in the 2006 Asian Squash Championships in Taiwan. In the past three years, Hill has also become an integral part of the Harvard team. He will likely play number two or three on the ladder this year.
“He just pushes himself through where most people would not be able to,” co-captain Frank Cohen notes.
Few would be able to put themselves through such an experience, but Hill knew squash was his top priority.
“There were times when I came back at night and was really bummed out,” Hill recounts. “It was tough mentally. I told myself to pull through it—this is the game that I love.”
Nonetheless, there were times when Hill second-guessed his decisions.
“I asked myself why I was doing this,” Hill remembers. “I don’t miss [the schedule]. It was mentally and physically very draining. My time here at Harvard has been much more relaxed.”
Hill thinks too that his experience has changed him as a person. The sheer difficulty of his day-to-day routine, he notes, has built a lot of character, and Hill knows he would not be the same person without it.
Now, a junior with the Crimson, Hill finds himself playing squash in about as different a setting as possible. His years in the army, though, are never far from his mind.
“Sometimes I do think about it,” Hill says. “I use that moment in the army as motivation, that if I set myself a goal I could achieve it. When I feel down in the dumps I think about what I put myself through in the army.”
“Knowing where he came from, it’s less of a surprise as to what he’s like on the team,” Cohen adds. “[Hill’s story] explains a lot in terms of his work ethic, his motivation.”
Hill’s military service may help motivate him, but he needs nothing to encourage him to give squash his all. Even talking about the sport gives Hill an obvious degree of pleasure.
“I was very passionate about my squash [ever] since I was back in middle school and high school,” Hill says earnestly.
“My love affair with the game has not been diminished. It has only grown with time. I love the game too much to let it all go.”

Universitiesandcolleges.org' September survey of university-run Twitter accounts  recently revealed some pretty interesting results: Harvard has the the most Twitter followers out of any U.S. university—with 18,955 total. (Stanford is a distant second with 10,873 followers.)
Harvard has accumulated so many followers partly because it operates over a dozen different Twitter accounts—including @HarvardSummer, @HarvardFASGreen, @harvard_uos (University Operations Services), @HUDSInfo, @HBSJobs, and of course @HarvardGenEd. The University's official Twitter account boasts 4,207 followers: only 22 percent of Harvard's total stalkers.
Here are Harvard's FAS Green Offices, for example:

All right, Harvard is getting defensive about an A- by mentioning that no one got an A. Also, two of the three grades that dragged Harvard's grade down were for Student Involvement (a B) and  Endowment Transparency (a C).  Surprised?

The lone pitchers of water  added insult to injury for the up and coming academics about to attempt  the hardest job market in decades. The irony of food cutbacks for  this meeting was simply cruel.
The event, a panel on the faculty application process for grad students entitled "The View From The Search Committee," drew 100 plus mostly humanities graduate students to Dudley House Tuesday afternoon.
The troubles  of today’s market were temporarily overshadowed by the more immediate concerns  of going through the application process, but the downturn was far from forgotten.
Panelist and Government Professor  James E. Alt, who also serves on his own department’s search committees, emphasized to students that  search committees would be especially particular about their choices  this year, because they “haven’t gained the confidence that next  year will happen.”
“It’s a super difficult  year,” Brendan Karch, a 6th year graduate student in the History department, told Flyby at the event. “You just have to go  out there and hope that the prestige of Harvard will help get your foot  in the door.”
The panelists weren’t too optimistic.
“Put yourself in the position  of a committee member,” said Alt. There are 250 others applying, he  explained. “Just. Like. You.”
Crushingly, it sounded all too  similar to that other application process. Then comes grad school. Then this?
A quick summary of the advice,  in a mix of one-liners and clichés, after the jump:
Alt:
“Time is short” (Committee  members average 5 minutes per app).
Ask help from advisers because  “you know they must be good at it because they have a job.”
“Be oblong” (Well rounded  but particularly strong in one area).
Romance Professsor Mary M.  Gaylord:
“Summarize Proust” (Time  is short during the job talk, too. See “Monty Python”).
“Dress so as not to distract.”
“Never apologize.”
Anthropology Professor Michael Herzfeld:
“Perfection is a form of arrogance, but so is not doing the best you can.”
“Less is more.”
“Don’t babble and don’t gabble” (don’t be nervous).
Herzfeld ended the event with perhaps the best advice anyone can offer. “I wish you good luck. The rest is in your hands.”

Ever want to cheer up a friend stressed-out by midterms, but too busy studying for your own midterms to buy them a gift? Ever wish your parents could buy you Berryline from 1,000 miles away?
Well now they can.
You can send your friends/family/loved ones/crushes/randos/enemies/anyone-whose-phone-number-you-know a gift without getting up from your chair at KangoGift.com, a week-old site based in Cambridge.
But enough with the overly promotional verbiage—basically, you log on to KangoGift.com, select what you would like to purchase as a gift, enter the recipient's phone number, pay via credit card, and then the gift-receiver will get a text message that entitles them to whatever you purchased for them from whatever store sells it. Currently at KangoGift.com you can buy gifts for people at Berryline, Daedalus, Trata, Finale, and a local flowershop.
More information on deals this week, including two-for-one Berryline, after the jump.
Through the upcoming parents weekend KangoGift is offering discounts on the normal price of products. You can buy a gift of two small Berryline dishes for the price of one (and you can always have it sent to yourself). Also, entering the promotional code "hparents" gets you 15 percent off purchases through Freshman Parents' Weekend.
“I’m very proud to say that in the US we are the first company to go to market with this specific approach,” said co-founder and owner Todd Horton. “Cambridge is just an awesome spot to launch a company like this.”
Similar companies will be opening in the U.S. soon, predicted Horton, who holds an MBA from Yale. Horton said his company charges the same rates as in stores or lower and gets its cut from participating companies. He also said cell phone numbers would only be used to send the text with the gift code and would not be used for advertising.

If you walked by John Harvard today, you probably saw a small group of freshmen staked out in front of the statue.
Were they protecting it? No.
Protesting? Nope.
Punching? Initiating? Bingo.
The students, who claimed to be “guarding” John Harvard, spent the day preventing tourists from taking pictures. It was a measure of increased campus security, they said.
In reality the freshmen are Hasty Pudding punches initiates, or “neophytes” as the club likes to refer to them.  FlyBy wasn't lucky enough to be one of them, but those who made the cut received an email shortly before midnight on Tuesday that asked them to pretend to be John Harvard bodyguards from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. today, in one-hour shifts.
Said one neo, who asked not to be named for fear of offending the club’s leaders,
How did the camera-wielding tourists respond? More on the prank, after the jump.
When one tour group approached, led by an admissions office student tourguide, a neo dressed in all black explained that no picture-taking was allowed, because Ben Affleck was filming in the Square, and because President Obama would be in town soon. “We can’t have any clumping here,” the neo told the crowd.
“But we’re clumping even if we’re not taking pictures,” the confused tour guide replied. “Okay, back up guys,” the tour guide instructed her group. A boy on the tour yelled at the neos, “It’s America, brother.”
One woman went to a HUPD officer to ask permission to take a picture, then returned to the statue and demanded that she be allowed to photograph John Harvard without the neos in the picture. Being courteous, well-bred young men and women, they obliged.
According to one neo, eventually a HUPD cop showed up and asked what was going on. When the neos explained it was part of a punch, reportedly HUPD said they could carry on, as long as they weren’t rude, or doing anything illegal.
One neo thought the task was pretty funny:
The President of the Hasting Pudding Kate Harris could not be reached for comment.
