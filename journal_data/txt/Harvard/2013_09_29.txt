After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Robert A. Caro, a 1966 Nieman Fellow and an acclaimed biographer of Lyndon B. Johnson, described his decades-long journey of uncovering the former president’s life and political career in front of an audience of other Nieman Fellows on Saturday as part of the Nieman Foundation’s 75th anniversary celebration.
 
For his research, Caro said he moved to the Hill Country region of Texas to further understand Johnson’s upbringing and developed close relationships with the president’s family and acquaintances. The former president had a duality as an opportunist who “had a real problem with the truth” and a visionary who fought against poverty and race issues, Caro said. 
More than 1,400 past fellows and Neiman affiliates from as early as 1963 came to Harvard from all over the world to celebrate foundation’s anniversary this weekend. The series of events included Soundings—a Nieman tradition where fellows share their journalistic backgrounds and experiences—and a presentation of the I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker.
 
The events on Saturday began with “The 90-Minute Nieman,” during which Harvard and MIT faculty offered inspirational messages to the journalists. 
“During our Nieman year, it’s a year of constant thought-provoking messages, but we don’t [usually] get this kind of thing,” said Geneva Overholser, a professor at the University of Southern California and a 1986 Nieman Fellow. “So all of us now, coming together, and getting to hear from these tremendous speakers, it’s been wonderful.”
 
Since its establishment in 1938, the Nieman Foundation has hosted over 1,300 fellows, including 102 Pulitzer Prize winners.
 
This reunion is “just a way for people to relive their Nieman year,” Ellen Tuttle, a spokesperson for the foundation, said.
  
Each year the foundation hosts 12 U.S. and 12 international journalists for a 10-month stay at Harvard to explore any topic of interest to them. During their time at Harvard, the fellows have access to classes, professors, seminars, and master classes. The foundation also hosts a few visiting fellows for a shorter period of time each year.
 
“The fellowship experience is very special and they create lifelong bonds … they are able to have those professional and personal connections around the world. That is why I think people want to come back and come to a big reunion like this,” Tuttle said.
 
James Geary, the foundation’s deputy curator and a 2012 fellow, said that he has experienced the benefits of getting to know other fellows.
 
“We’re there for each other around the world, wherever you are covering a story, you know you can get on the phone and talk to a Nieman Fellow who’s going to be nearby,” Geary said.
 “When you need help or council, fellows are there for each other.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 3, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of past Nieman fellows and affiliates that came to Cambridge for the Nieman Foundation’s 75th anniversary celebration. In fact, the celebration attracted more than 1,400 past Nieman fellows and affiliates, not more than 400.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Look for forward Andre Akpan ’10 on ESPN tonight as his New York Red Bulls of the MLS take on the Seattle Sounders at 9 p.m. The former Crimson captain and NCAA All-American was named Ivy League Player of the Year during his senior year, and ranks as Harvard’s all-time leading scorer with 127 points. He was also a semifinalist for the Hermann Trophy for three straight seasons. 
 After starting at The Oakridge School during high school, Akpan began his career at Harvard with tremendous success. As a freshman, he was unanimously voted as the Ivy League Rookie of the Year and was named to the First Team All-Ivy League. After graduating in 2010, Akpan was drafted by the Colorado Rapids, and played for the Real Maryland Monarchs club and FC Tampa Bay for brief periods as well. He was traded to the Red Bulls last March and made an assist in his first game a month later. Akpan also contributed an assist in his second playing opportunity last May, and scored four goals for the Red Bulls Reserves earlier this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard men’s soccer team played 80 minutes of hard-fought scoreless soccer, but its fate had already been decided.
Nine minutes into Sunday afternoon’s matchup against St. Francis (5-2-1), the Crimson (1-5-2) let in the only goal of the game and fell at Ohiri field in its final match before the start of Ivy League play.
Harvard attacked early and won its first corner kick of the game less than two minutes in. Senior defender Ross Friedman connected with sophomore defender Mark Ashby in the box, but Ashby’s header went wide. The Crimson possessed the ball and held the Terriers to zero shots in the first eight minutes, but a corner kick in the ninth minute would be Harvard’s undoing.
While the Crimson was unable to capitalize on its early set piece, St. Francis seized its first opportunity. Senior defender Riccardo Milano tracked down a corner kick by senior midfielder John Johansson and headed it into the lower left corner of the net for his first goal of the season.
Down early in the first half, Harvard came back firing with three opportunities—including two shots by sophomore forward Oliver White—in the next ten minutes.
“I think the key for us is always to regroup after a goal against us, to get together and talk through what went wrong and fix it going forward, and to make sure we have the mentality of attack,” senior midfielder Kevin Harrington said. “You’ve got to play like it’s 0-0 and the game is still yours.”
The Crimson’s effort would not be enough, as it was scoreless in its second straight game and for the fourth time eight games. Of Harvard’s 12 shots, only four were on target, and Terriers Junior goalkeeper Jack Binks made the four saves to preserve his second consecutive complete-game shutout.
Harrington led the Crimson with four shots—including two on goal—for his highest total of the season. Harvard outshot St. Francis in the second half, eight to seven, but was unable to find the back of the net despite a number of close calls.
“If we finish two of those chances, the result changes today,” Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer said. “Look at any of those games where we have six or seven chances in the six [yard line]. If those get finished, we’ve won two or three of those [games]. I think they know how close they are, and its frustrating not to have turned the corner yet, but we’ll keep going at it.”
As shot after shot went wide, Harvard continued to dominate the possession game, playing the majority of the second half in the Terriers’ territory. The Crimson’s best chance of the period came 30 minutes in, when freshman forward Daniel Smith headed the ball towards a gap in the St. Francis defense. Though Binks could not get there in time to make the save, the ball ricocheted off the right post and out of bounds.
Despite being unable to covert on offense, Harvard’s strong defensive performance kept its deficit at one. Senior Brett Conrad and sophomore Evan Mendez split time in goal for the Crimson and combined for seven saves.
After starting the previous two games, Mendez came in at the half and put up his second straight shutout performance. He made two quick saves within five minutes of entering the game, including a free kick by Terriers junior forward Kevin Correa that made it over Harvard’s defensive wall. Mendez was able to get a hand on the high shot and tip it over the crossbar for a St. Francis corner kick.
Twenty minutes later Mendez made another acrobatic save, diving far to his right to deflect a Terriers header out of bounds with one hand.
“All you can ask for is an opportunity to win the game, and we had that today,” Harrington said. “We didn’t quite capitalize on it, but you have to take the positives out. We played good enough defense to keep them to only one goal, and we could come out with a win if we could get those opportunities in.”
The Crimson’s losing record in the non-conference heavy portion of its season will not preclude the team from a shot at the Ivy League title, but Harvard is looking to learn from its early losses to reverse the trend.
“From here on out, we can no longer have these losses,” Harrington said. “We’ve got to finish off our chances and keep pushing forward and putting the ball in the back of the net.”

Because there just weren’t enough Buzzfeed articles about it, and we guarantee that this post will someday save your life, here is a Harvard Student’s Guide to Spotting a True New Yorker.
First, in order to identify a true New Yorker, one must define a true New Yorker. A true New Yorker lives in New York City—no, not suburban Westchester or Long Island—and Buffalo, who are you kidding? Sure, technically “New Yorker” refers to anybody from New York State, but let’s be real—nobody pictures the spacious valleys of Ithaca when thinking of New York. You may think you’ve got us New Yorkers figured out, but there’s more to us than just rudeness and impatience (although that’s a pretty big part). Here are six classic cases.
1.  The Confused Pedestrian Who Doesn’t Know How to Respond to Nice People.
We’ll probably look at you with a dumb look on our face if you’re a stranger that just wanted to wish us a good morning. Do we wave back? Do we pretend not to notice? Do we run away? We will have this same dumbfounded look when a car stops to let us cross. New York drivers stop for no one—they’ve been known to treat a traffic light as more of a suggestion than a law. Don’t be surprised when we don’t know how to respond to kindness—we don’t get a lot of that back home.
2. The Speed Walker.
New Yorkers are born crawling at a rate of five miles per hour, so you best get out of their way. If you happen to accidentally stop walking in front of a New Yorker (bless your soul), don’t be offended by the foot tapping, the rolling eyes, and the glares. It could be worse—it takes all of our energy not to tackle you then and there. Just move it along, we’ve got things to do.
3.  The Crowd Weaver.
 
New Yorkers are always on a mission, and weaving through the death trap of Times Square and the 2 train during rush hour has taught us to master crowds with the utmost efficiency—we can probably do it blindfolded with a cup of coffee in hand. We know the crowd. We feel the crowd. We own the crowd.
4.  The One Who Refuses to Believe Cambridge is a City. 
 
You think this quaint town of just over 100,000 inhabitants is a city? That’s cute.
5.  The New Jersey Hater.
The armpit of New York has a habit of trying to compare itself to the greatest city in the world. Sure, New Jersey may have its moments, but the home of Snooki is really barking up the wrong tree. Also, no matter how many times a Jerseyan has crossed the border, as long as you’re not going home to one of the five boroughs, you’re not a New Yorker. (You guys can have Staten Island back, though.)
6.  The Proud New Yorker.
Within seconds of meeting us, we will make sure you know that we’re from New York (New York City). We’ll give you a second to soak in our glory. We’ll then go on our usual spiel complaining about how smelly the subway system is and how there are too many people; but don’t you dare join in our complaints.  We’ll casually talk about our morning runs on the Brooklyn Bridge and shopping in SoHo. We’ll bring up the time we saw Neil Patrick Harris at Starbucks and Jake Gyllenhaal on the 6 train like it’s no big deal. The Knicks, Giants, and Yankees are the best teams (but we’ve learned to keep quiet about the last one in Boston). New Yorkers think we're the greatest, because we are.
If you see anybody acting in any of the ways outlined above, you’ve got yourself a true New Yorker—so be sure to get out of their way and be sure to ask them about The City. We love it.

The crop of Harvard-related social media sites seems to grow by the day. From the Tumblr devoted to HUDS Haikus to I Saw You Harvard, these blogs and webpages run the gamut from poetic to stalker-ish. Here’s a roundup of a few of the notable ones.
 
On Twitter:
  Parody accounts to the max. According to the imaginations of the students behind these accounts, the thoughts of administrators like Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman '67 and President Drew G. Faust and statistics professors Joseph K. Blitzstein and Michael I. Parzen center around “boozin',” rap music, and stat-related pick up lines. Yeah, apparently they’re a thing.
  More entertaining than all of these was the short-lived @HarvardProbz, which ran for a few weeks last winter, accurately identifying many “problems” Harvard students face—from being photographed during Primal Scream to shoeless people in Lamont. Perhaps this is one account that someone should revive.
 
On Tumblr:
   Sleeping at Lamont, Sh*t Harvard Students Say, and What Should H Call Me are a few Harvard-related tumblrs, though all three now seem to be mostly dormant. What’s up with that? How else are we going to share our great picture of the obnoxious kid from section spotted drooling in an armchair in Lamont Café? Calling all freshmen: let’s bring these back.
 
On Facebook:
 The already-reviewed Harvard Crushes, Harvard Confessions, and Crimson Compliments live on and live strong—okay, one of them does. Harvard Crushes has grown to be the most popular of these three Harvard Facebook pages, with posts ranging from the adorable to the incredibly sketchy.

A little over a week ago, we lamented that it was more convenient to get to the Yard for students using Wellesley’s bus system than for students in the Quad using Harvard’s own shuttles—but now it looks like Harvard has taken the lead in the battle for better transportation.
Harvard recently announced plans to bring back its weekend morning shuttle service to and from the Quad, so as of Saturday, shuttles leave over four hours earlier on weekend mornings than they did previously. The Crimson Cruiser now begins its weekend route at 8:15 a.m. at Mather (a far cry from the post-noon departure time of yesteryear).
 
This change is taking place within two weeks of Wellesley updating their weekend Senate bus schedule, a move which made it arguably more convenient for Harvard students to get to and from Wellesley’s campus than it was for them to commute to the Yard from the Quad.
Maybe Harvard noticed the foolishness of this discrepancy, because it’s finally taken action to correct the oft-criticized shuttle weekend schedule. In any case, improving the shuttle schedule is one ride we’ll tag along for.
It may be hard to believe, but summer has officially ended and the college admissions cycle is in full swing. Hopefully, you’ve started to make some headway on your applications, but exactly how far along should you be? Deadlines are deceptively far away at this point (even for all you early action/decision people), but it’s important to not fall behind. At the end of every month, our advice team will bring you the By Now feature, a handy list to keep you on track.
1. The Common App
You should have a draft of the Common App essay and some brainstorming ideas for your supplementary essays. Nothing has to be finalized, but it’s good to have ideas down on paper. Start the proofreading process by asking friends and family for input, and revisit your essay often.
2. Recommendations
You should have asked for your recommendation letters by now. Give the writers a friendly reminder a week or two before the deadline. For those of you who already have your recommendations, be sure thank your writers!
3. The College List
You should be visiting schools you’re interested in and finalizing your application list. Be sure to mark all the different deadlines on your calendar, and be sure to check for applications to scholarships and programs unique to each school.
4. Test Scores
You should have almost all of your test scores, unless you were planning on a last minute fall SAT or ACT. If you’ve finalized your list of schools, figure out which scores you will need to send to each. Pay particular attention to schools that require SAT Subject Tests.
5. Right, High School
It’s easy to get caught up in applying to college, but stay focused on your academics. This semester is very important, so make sure to stay on top of it.
6. Start Shopping
Keep an eye out for sales on interview-appropriate clothing. A sharp blazer or nice skirt goes a long way in making a good first impression!
Enjoy senior year of high school, but don’t assume that everything can be done right before the deadlines. Realize that while this process is stressful, you’ll come out of this it with a much better sense of what you want for the next four years of your life. Being prepared and being proactive is your best plan of action.
