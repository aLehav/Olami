After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cutting an 11-point deficit to three with just under two minutes to go, the Harvard men’s basketball team had a chance to tie the game late.
With two seconds left on the clock, freshman guard Corey Johnson found the ball in his hands. He had hit a nearly identical shot in pre-game warmups–a deep three from dead center. After receiving the ball from junior guard Corbin Miller, Johnson found an opening and let the ball go. But as the buzzer sounded and the backboard glowed red, Johnson’s shot clanked off the rim to send the Crimson (6-8) to a 65-62 defeat to Vermont (8-7), its first loss of 2016.
“I know it’s been a brutal stretch for us with travel and the Diamond Head Classic,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “But we’re home and we [had] an opportunity to play against a quality team and I’m disappointed that we didn’t play better.”
Getting the lead to three itself required a furious comeback. With 5:32 left in the contest, a layup gave the Catamounts their largest lead of the game at 11. After Harvard cut it to six, Vermont pushed it to nine on a three by Ernie Duncan. Then, the Crimson mounted its comeback.
First, sophomore Chris Egi hit one of two from the charity stripe to cut the lead to eight. On Harvard’s next possession, senior Agunwa Okolie scored on a jumper to cut the lead to six. After forcing a Vermont turnover, junior Corbin Miller got the ball on his favorite spot on the floor, draining a three under duress in front of the Harvard bench.
Though Vermont did not score in the last four minutes, its defense shone. All day, the Catamounts played lockdown defense on Edosomwan, the Crimson’s leading scorer. Edosomwan was limited to eight points on only six shots from the field and fought against near constant double-teams.
“I’ve learned also when you get the double team there’s someone open and dump back in,” Edosomwan said. “But they did a really good job today and I think a big part of their gameplan was at least not letting me try to score at all, whether it was anytime I caught the ball or any place to not get the ball in my hands so they did a great job.”
The Crimson similarly struggled to generate offense in a 27-point first half. The team was dealt a major blow when starting point guard Tommy McCarthy went down with a knee injury, worsened when he would not return. Harvard, already thin at point guard after junior Matt Fraschilla tore his ACL earlier in the year, turned to Miller to run the offense when McCarthy left after just seven minutes.
“Corbin is a guy that settles our offense, settles our team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s a very respected guy in our program so you look at him as a leader and so handling the ball for us, running our team, being the quarterback comes natural in that regard.”
Sophomore Andre Chatfield, who has battled injuries of his own all season, saw limited action at the point to give Miller a brief respite. While Amaker said he did not expect Chatfield to have to step up as much as he did today, he praised the sophomore’s defensive contribution.
“I thought Dre really did a nice job for us defensively, which is what we need from him, to be active and to guard the ball,” Amaker said.
After trailing by just five at half, the Crimson was unable to take the lead in the second half. Twice Harvard went on a run to tie the game, but Vermont responded in both cases, taking advantage of 17 Harvard turnovers. On the day, the Catamounts had 23 points on Crimson giveaways.
Amaker said that he was disappointed with the team’s performance given its recent play. Before Sunday’s loss, Harvard had won four of its last five contests.
“A little bit of a setback for us obviously, kind of the way we’ve been playing,” Amaker said. “Give credit to Vermont, I mean they were very focused and I thought they played in a tough manner... We’re just disappointed and that’s what we’re discussing with our team, especially because we felt like we made some huge strides and had some great growth prior to today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two of its best playmakers looking on from the bench, the Harvard men’s basketball team (6-8) lost its first game of the new year, 65-62, to visiting Vermont (8-7). The Crimson turned the ball over 17 times, leading to 23 Catamount points, and never led in the second half.
TURNOVERS, TURNOVERS
The Crimson started the game quickly, taking a 4-0 lead in less than a minute on two assisted baskets. Passing the ball well, Harvard looked like the team that had 22 assists on 30 field goals against Wofford, not the unit that averages 15 turnovers a contest.
Regression to the mean was swift.
After a series of crisp passes led to a wide-open freshman Corey Johnson three-point attempt on the next possession, junior Zena Edosomwan turned the ball over on consecutive possessions. In the next time five minutes, the Crimson had five giveaways and no points.
“We kind of got the confidence that we can play with anybody and today we just didn’t do a good job of execution,” Edosomwan said.
The situation worsened when freshman Tommy McCarthy exited the game with an apparent injury after seven minutes. McCarthy, who played just seven minutes and missed his only two field goals, would not return for the rest of the game. After the game, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said that he didn’t know what his point guard’s status would be moving forward.
Joining McCarthy on the bench was senior Patrick Steeves, who did not dress for the game after playing 25 minutes in the team’s last contest. The duo are not only the top two distributors for the Crimson, averaging a combined 6.6 assists per game, but also two of the team’s best three-point shooters.
Without their two top passers, the team finished with five fewer assists than turnovers. Senior Evan Cummins and sophomore Andre Chatfield were the only players to finish with more assists than turnovers, as Edosomwan and senior Agunwa Okolie combined for seven turnovers against just one assist.
“Pat’s a huge asset and honestly he’s made such a big difference in our turnaround,” Edosomwan said. “He comes off the bench and there’s so many things he can do. We lost Tommy pretty early in the first half so that was also tough but at the same time we’re the type of team where we don’t make excuses.”
STEPPING IN, STEPPING UP
With McCarthy on the bench, Amaker turned to junior backup Corbin Miller. The steady upperclassman kept the team in the game with five treys, none bigger than his triple with 1:41 to go that cut the lead to three. Miller’s 15 points were his second-highest effort of a season and good for second on the team.
Miller and backcourt running mate Johnson barely sat in the second half with McCarthy out and Cummins and Edosomwan in constant foul trouble. Johnson, Miller, and Okolie—who combined for 45 of the team’s 62 points—sat for a combined five minutes in the second half.
Okolie in particular was more aggressive to compensate for the team’s loss of spacing. The senior took 11 shots, nearly twice his season average, including seven in the second half. He had two blocks, two steals, and three rebounds in playing the entire final period.
“We need him to rebound and we needed so much more out of him today from an offensive standpoint, given the way we’ve been played,” Amaker said. “He didn’t shoot as well as we would’ve liked from the foul line, but he got there eight times and that’s what we need from an active, athletic player.”
Despite the absences, however, after the game, Amaker, noting his disappointment, said that he was unwilling to chalk up the loss to adverse circumstances.
“I’m sure there are a lot of factors that played into why we played the way we played,” Amaker said. “… You gotta figure it out and keep going. They played better than we did and deserved to win and we didn’t.”
