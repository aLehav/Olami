Every year, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. This award has undergone numerous changes in title and qualifications since its conception in 1959, shifts that may be indicative of a lack of consensus about how to categorize musical comedy. The synthesis of comedic and musical influences blurs the boundaries of the two forms, making it difficult to definitively identify and organize the genre.
Recent viral videos further bring these boundaries into question. The Lonely Island, an American comedy trio, has achieved widespread popularity through their work on Saturday Night Live with music videos like “I Just Had Sex” and “YOLO.” The Gregory Brothers, known for their catchy autotune creations—most famously the “Bed Intruder Song”—similarly use music as a vehicle for comedy. Music itself doesn’t seem to be the primary goal of these projects; the melodies are often supplementary to the lyrics and the content of the videos they accompany.
It is this use of music as a means rather than an end that distinguishes The Lonely Island from artists like Johnny Cash and Eminem, who employ humor to enhance their music. In “A Boy Named Sue,” Cash sings from the perspective of a man named Sue who struggles to come to terms with his feminine name. The humor of the premise makes the song’s social commentary on gender norms more palatable than, say, a straight-faced rant might be. Likewise, Eminem’s “The Real Slim Shady” jokes about drugs, masturbation, and other potentially unsavory subjects, and in doing so engages with difficult issues that might otherwise be tricky to confront. One might consider these tracks “comedy folk” and “comedy hip-hop,” respectively—subgenres in which comedic elements play into specific, long-established musical traditions.
Parody artists like “Weird Al” Yankovic and Jon Lajoie may exemplify the most balanced marriage of music and comedy by parodying musical traditions themselves. Their works integrate the two forces by humorously adapting pre-existing musical melodies for satirical effect, with discographies that span genres, drawing from multiple styles  either to shed new light on the source or rework it completely for their own purposes. Jon Lajoie illuminates musical tropes by combining them and breaking them down. “Everyday Normal Guy” juxtaposes an archetypal hip-hop beat with lyrics like “If you wanna mess with me I think you probably can / Because I am not confident and I am weak for a man,” subverting the expectation that rap artists have to be tough and aggressive. Weird Al, on the other hand, is known for rewriting the lyrics of popular songs. His work’s humor lies in its complete departure from the intent of the original artist. In “Foil,” for example, he turns Lorde’s “Royals,” a critique of contemporary artists’ lavish lifestyles, into whimsical musings on leftover restaurant food and conspiracy theorists. For these artists, neither music nor comedy is subordinate to the other, for they have inextricably morphed the two into a single entity.
Regardless of how comedy- or music-centric a work of musical comedy is, in order to be fully appreciated it is often necessary to know the context or reference material for the humor. As with most forms of comedy, understanding the background of the subject can be crucial to comprehending its wit. A song that utilizes humor for social commentary relies on the listener's understanding of social norms, while a piece parodying a certain genre assumes the listener is aware of the stereotypes and hits songs of that style. Despite dependence on the primary material, this relationship creates space in which a new product may even surpass the original. In all its iterations, the union of comedy and music has the potential to inspire enlightening discourse on humor, art, and the social issues of our time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was hard not to remember that the first joint she’d ever liked had been from his lips. In college it’d been all dark rooms, cheap beer, men’s and women’s hands moving under her sweater, over her skin, smoky air, and a dullness that drifted down into her gut and would surface as a headache if she woke too early the next morning, wrappers from burgers, tinfoil off burritos, cartons of dried, cold Chinese takeout, and a mossy taste in her mouth the only indicators of what’d happened. Then she’d smoked with Lai, a few months into their relationship. He’d lit the joint and passed it to her. She remembered it. The sharpness of the light on the other end of the paper. That small flame. The way he’d carefully nurtured it, not let it get too big as she had, sucking in too much smoke, her coughs already feeling distant as the weed hit.
They’d already kissed by then, but it was different when they put their mouths to the same thing that would take them to who knew where. She’d known that with the first joint and with all those afterwards. There was still ash on the railing of the staircase. It’d been too many days. She didn’t think the insurance company was going to give them much money. She should tell Lai. She opened the door to his office and shut it very carefully, facing it. She felt it click in her fingers. Lai was watching her when she turned around. The monitor of the computer displayed the desktop—he’d minimized everything. His wallpaper was a generic photo of a flower that had come pre-installed.
She sat in the chair next to him. At first she stared at the desk. He’d cleaned it. There were only a few loose papers on the left side of his keyboard now, the right side occupied by the legal pad on which he took notes. He’d scrawled down some words, indecipherable to her from this angle. But she knew he’d started a new story.
She’d promised herself she wouldn’t cry, but when she looked at his face, she nearly did. She had to clear her throat. Lai watched her.
She looked down. Her hands were strangely still, half-curled into fists against her knees.
“I love you.”
A breath like a tidal wave rolled over her. Lai’s hands were digging into the sides of his chair. He breathed out again. His breath smelled humid.
She touched one of those hands. “I love you,” she said again. “I hope you’re not angry with me.”
“A little.” He was frowning, but he took her hand into his. His skin was cold, hers a little damp. She wanted to pull away and rub off the moisture before letting him hold it again. Their hands rose and fell as he took another breath.
“And I’m sorry about the fire.” His eyes widened. “I’m sorry that happened.”
When he didn’t reply, she said, “I don’t think the insurance men are going to be generous with the claim. I heard them talking when you went to get them water.”
She said, “It was careless.”
“Yes.”
“I know.” The words sounded too quick in her ears, fading thin. She didn’t want to meet his eyes but forced herself to, and even then narrowed her own so it didn’t feel as much like looking into the sun. His eyes were still on her face. Her own kept darting their gaze—from each of his pupils, inside which she could see herself, huge and round, distorted, to his mouth, to the point of his nose—until she looked down. Closed her eyes. “I’m sorry,” she said.
She realized she didn’t want him to tell her it was all right or that she was forgiven or that it hadn’t been her fault. All throughout the house, there was evidence it had been—films of ash that looked soft but came away gritty on her fingers, black marks of boots, swirls of soot they weren’t allowed to touch for another few days, or weeks even, but she didn’t know how it all worked, if one day she and Lai would wake up in the same bed again to a clean house or if they would sell this one and move away, the spaces where they slept growing farther and farther apart, if she would ever not think of his unmoving weight in bed, if he would tell her, one day, that it’d been okay to make him wait so long and stew in the question of his unwantedness. That it’d been okay. They’d been okay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday, America will celebrate the 240th anniversary of Paul Revere’s “Midnight Ride” with, like, a Google doodle or something.
At midnight, if you look at my window in Canaday courtyard, you might see a light, just as Paul saw lantern signals in the Old North Church—“one if by land, two if by sea.” If you see a light in my dorm room, I’m at my desk doing homework on a Friday night. And if you don’t, I’m at my desk doing homework on a Friday night, and I’ve closed the blind because I’m embarrassed.
It’s not a particularly complicated system. Most Friday and Saturday nights, you can find me studying unabashedly in my room. Except not that unabashedly, because the blind is usually closed.
I’m not a total shut-in. I get out there every few weeks, and I spend the requisite two or three hours bobbing my knees and wondering how soon I can leave. I get plenty of invitations. I’m supposed to be at a party as I write this, but I begged off at the last minute. “I have an essay. Bawling emoji. Bawling emoji. Bawling emoji.” And I have friends to go with, including several who make me beam every time they ask, again, if I’ll go out with them (a sick pleasure, since I usually say no).
I’m just scared. I’m scared because I don’t know if I know how to dance and because I don’t want to get drunk and look stupid. (And I definitely don’t want to be sober and look stupid.) I’m scared because I really do have an essay that’s due soon, and because I’m probably going to hurt my joints with all this knee bobbing. I’m scared that everyone knows I’m scared. I’m scared because I don’t want to do the wrong thing, and I don’t know how to release my anxiety for even an hour.
So I close my blind, do some homework, and send apologetic texts. I let my friends drink peach Rubinoff without me, and I spend another night biting my nails and avoiding my fears.
But then, in between response papers, I thought about something my mom used to say. She told me, “Get outside your comfort zone,” and I know this is just what she meant.
It’s ridiculous to pass up a great night with the best people just because I’m afraid. Nobody’s watching me. Everybody’s intoxicated. And there’s no reason to worry that I don’t know if I know how to dance, because obviously I don’t know how to dance. That one is settled. I should really just go for it.
So next Friday night, when America celebrates the 240-and-one-week anniversary of Paul Revere’s “Midnight Ride,” you can look up at my room above Canaday courtyard, and the light will probably be on. I’ll be at my desk, studying, because overcoming social anxiety is easier said than done. And also I do have an essay to write. Like, actually.
But I probably won’t close the blind. Because the first step is admitting you have a problem. And because I just published this nonsense, so it’s not really worth the energy to stand up and walk three feet to my window.
Plus, sometimes I do have great fun. Like if I’ve really knocked an essay out of the park, I’ll blast “I’m Sexy and I Know It” and shake my ass while I brush my teeth.
What can I say? I’m wild.

MOSCOW—It’s a cool Sunday night on the Kremlin, and Vladimir is Putin on the ritz. An attaché enters the gilded office with pink wine—the vodka’s just for the cameras—and a television remote.
“Mad Men” comes on. Smoking, terribly mustachioed oligarchs drinking themselves to death—it’s a transatlantic tale. Like all episodes, this one is self-consciously opaque, and Putin is uneasy, despite the perfectly timed delivery of an old fashioned by the keen attaché.
Donald Draper, the show’s disturbed center who deserted the army and mostly concerns himself with wallowing in self-pity, has never been a favorite of Putin’s. But the upstart junior account man Pete Campbell hardly makes an appearance in the premiere.
It’s 1970s America, and the millionaire characters strut about wearing Hans Hofmann paintings, shuttling between the cloistered enclaves of New York and Los Angeles in embarrassing luxury. Putin remembers that Matt Weiner said that the series will end in the present day, and wonders what events of history will make the bubble pop: Afghanistan, Reagan, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, me.
Brezhnev had control then. Then Brezhnev died, and Chairman Andropov succeeded him. And when they asked Andropov whether the Russian people followed him, Andropov replied they can either follow me, or they can follow Brezhnev.
The mood darkens and the channel flips. “The Americans,” FX’s series about two deeply embedded KGB spies, comes on. But the frown didn’t disappear, the attaché notes, as the offer for another drink is waved away.
What was once exciting has gone the way of all American television nowadays, Putin thinks. Elizabeth and Philips’ espionage have become less important than Elizabeth and Phillip’s personal struggles, the ends are lost sight of in meaningless moral kerfuffles over the means. And who gives a damn about Paige, anyway.
Berlin, Putin remembers. When the wall fell, he stood outside the KGB offices and kept the incensed East German crowd from ransacking the files with nothing but a pistol and his fluent German. The files were destroyed, and the Soviet state secrets were left to be entombed in their unopened archives. Now that's service for one’s country, back when that meant something.
Something impersonal and geopolitical is needed. Ale is brought. “Game Of Thrones” is put on. Putin brightens.
Silly Starks, he thinks, as the scattered shards of that once proud family are displayed—they were always putting honor ahead of family, ahead of self-preservation. He remembers how the unsuspecting Robb Stark was betrayed by Roose Bolton, just like his unsuspecting father was betrayed by Lord Baelish. And his favorite words of Baelish’s echo:
“Chaos isn’t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but refuse. They cling to the realm, or love, or the gods…illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is. But they’ll never know this. Not until it’s too late.”
Baelish’s cunning is highly respectable, his irresistible rise from the mediocre Fingers to the highest posts in Westeros admirable and not unlike his own, but Putin will never root for him. Aside from his debilitating weakness for Catelyn Stark-resembling objects, Littlefinger, just like Varys, only hatches his plans from the shadows.
But that’s not power. To be able to declare one’s intentions openly and to hear no dissent echoing—that is power.
No one grasps this better than Tywin Lannister. But now Putin remembers his unfortunate toilet incident last season, and hopes that the best has come for this most admirable of characters.
Alas! Tywin’s not well at all, and the kingdoms of Westeros splinter. The spine of the kingdom is broken, and the subjects hurriedly depart from its orbit. He’s seen it with his own eyes, and wonder whether Russia will see it too after he’s gone.
Putin’s evening isn’t going well. But then a thought comes, and he remembers something he watched during one of the 10 days he took off from being president to watch Netflix.
The attaché puts on the third episode of the third season of House of Cards, sets down a golden bottle and glass, and takes his leave for the evening. On screen, a gloriously churlish President Petrov talks with his American counterpart President Frank Underwood of outlasting his two predecessors, outdrinks everyone at the state dinner, manages to deface the White House, and even gets away with kissing the First Lady.
“За тебя!” Putin shouts as he empties the shot.
For the first time of the night, Putin smiles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five years is a long time. In 2010, people thought that the iPad would turn out to be a silly punch line of a device. Many more felt outrage about the British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon oil spill and compassion in the wake of a tragic earthquake in Haiti that killed hundreds of thousands of people.
Five years ago, administrators promised students that the release of details about the often-mysterious proceedings of the Administrative Board was imminent; they announced plans to create a comprehensive database of Ad Board cases that clearly shows the outcome of many cases. At the time, the Ad Board had even hired a “management fellow” to direct the project. In 2010, that fellow, Megan Mitrovich, who has not worked at Harvard in nearly three years, told The Crimson, “The hope is that students will be able to use this [the release of information about past cases with identifying details removed] as a ground for appeal or to determine that they have no grounds for appeal.” Although the Ad Board has continued to release five-year aggregate statistics every year, just as it did before 2010, it has fallen far short of its promise to release information with any level of detail about particular cases.
This lengthy delay in releasing more details about its proceedings is absurd. Students facing discipline from the Ad Board are left in a constant state of uncertainty due to the complete lack of a reliable database with details of the Ad Board’s proceedings. The numbers currently provided by the Ad Board constitute the lowest possible denominator; there is no context given to help students understand the decision making of the Ad Board. While we understand the necessity of protecting the confidentiality of individuals involved in these cases, we have little doubt that the cases can be redacted such that any privacy issues are mitigated.
Further, the manner in which the College is currently handling the discussion of the database’s potential release is dishonest. The constant delaying and resetting of deadlines for the release of this database is simply unacceptable. If administrators are still planning on making this vital database a reality (as they should), they need to set a timeline for its release and abide by their promise. If, on the other hand, they have changed their minds and decided not to renege on their earlier promise, that too must be communicated clearly. While we are firmly opposed to this second outcome, a final decision is nevertheless a better option than the current uncertainty.
As we have previously opined with regard to the Honor Council and sexual assault statistics, transparency in disciplinary proceedings is vital. Five years should have been plenty of time for the Ad Board to create this database, if only they had prioritized their promise; instead, the Ad Board’s inaction has forced students to face cases in front of the College’s highest disciplinary board with insufficient preparation. If Apple can change the way that people think about portable computers in five years, the Harvard administration can surely create a basic database as a service to students facing the uncertainty of an Ad Board case in the same timeframe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 16, 2015, at 12:03 a.m.
Environmental activist group Divest Harvard blockaded Massachusetts Hall for a fourth day on Wednesday, continuing to demand that Harvard divest its endowment from fossil fuels even as some top University officials largely ignored them.
The group of protesters launched the planned blockade of Harvard’s central administrative building on Sunday as part of its “Heat Week” demonstration, which so far has also included a four-hour blockade of University Hall and an occupation of the Harvard Alumni Association in an attempt to confront the administration about divestment. While protesters have successfully evoked responses from some administrators, others have not publicly reacted to the disruption as they have gone to work elsewhere.
After a nearly two-day sit-in that spanned Monday and Tuesday nights, protesters calling for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels left the Harvard Alumni Association at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning, unsuccessful in their attempt to meet with alumni office leadership to discuss divestment during their occupation.
Alumni supporters of Divest Harvard took to HAA headquarters on Mt. Auburn Street beginning on Monday at 2 p.m. to demand a meeting with the organization’s leaders. About a dozen protesters stayed overnight on Monday and Tuesday.
At the sit-in, alumni signed pledge cards for a fossil-free fund, an alternative to donating to the University’s endowment, that stipulates Harvard will only receive the donations if it publicly commits to divestment by Dec. 31, 2025. They presented around 60 pledge cards with donations up to $5,000 to Shannon Gerah, the human resources director for Alumni Affairs and Development, and plan to present another 40 to HAA that have been filled out at Mass. Hall, according to Collin Rees ’12, a coordinator for environmental activist organization 350.org.
Philip W. Lovejoy, executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, wrote in an email that the protesters did not try to set up a meeting prior to occupying the offices on Monday, though he or one of his colleagues generally meet with those alumni who request meetings in advance. He said he has offered demonstrators a meeting later in the month at a mutually convenient time.
“The alumni protesters were very civil and good guests,” wrote Lovejoy, who brought donuts for the alumni occupying his office Tuesday morning. “They vacuumed before they left this morning.”
Board chair of 350.org KC Golden, who camped out in the office on both nights, said the alumni do plan to meet with Lovejoy per his offer, but added that he was disappointed that they did not get a meeting during the sit-in. Still, Golden said the protesters gave it “a good college try.”
“We played out our best effort to generate a serious discussion,” he said. “Ten minutes of those 44 hours could have been mutually convenient.”
Meanwhile, protesters continued to blockade Mass. Hall on Wednesday, rallying outside the building. University President Drew G. Faust, whose office is located in Mass. Hall, has repeatedly argued against divestment as a means to address climate change and has condemned some of Divest Harvard’s previous demonstration tactics, such as the group’s February occupation of the same building.
At about 3:30 p.m., roughly 30 protesters, seeking to confront her, walked to Emerson Hall, where Faust was scheduled to deliver introductory remarks at a 4 p.m. lecture. The protesters, signs in hand, stood silently outside both the front steps of Emerson and a side entrance between Loeb House and Emerson. Several Harvard Police officers and metal guard rails blocked off the protesters from the side entrance near Loeb House, where Faust ultimately entered the lecture hall.
The protesters retreated to their blockade after Faust’s remarks, at about 4:15 p.m.
After several days of continuous protest, Divest Harvard has not received the response it wants from University administrators, some of whom have essentially ignored them, at least publicly. Divest Harvard co-coordinator Jasmine P. Opie ’16 said Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has checked in with demonstrators outside Mass. Hall periodically. But administrators whose offices have been affected by the blockades have relocated to work elsewhere, while police officers have not arrested any protesters for the blockades.
Protesters acknowledge that their efforts have not been met with the response they desire from University leaders.
“It's deeply disappointing for student groups who feel like the administration isn’t engaging in the ways we want,” Opie said. “In that sense, we will be disappointed if [Faust] doesn’t respond to us.”
Divest Harvard has said that it will continue its blockade of Mass. Hall through Friday, April 17.

Fifty years ago, Harvard sent acceptance letters to 20 percent of roughly 6,700 applicants to the Class of 1969. By 2006, that figure had dropped to 9.7 percent for the class of 2010 and since then has continued on a downward trend overall, reaching a record-low 5.3 percent acceptance rate earlier this month.
According to admissions experts, the historic decline in admissions rates will continue and has been driven by students applying to larger numbers of colleges, as well as universities stepping up recruitment efforts to grow their application pools.
“I think that colleges are trying to diversify in a lot of different ways, and that adds students to the pool,” said Bari Norman, co-founder of Expert Admissions. “What places like Harvard are doing is reaching out to people who wouldn’t have considered applying to Harvard,” Norman said, adding that she thinks the acceptance rate decline will continue.
While Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 has speculated that the Admissions Office’s use of a new low-income student outreach program called Harvard College Connection may have contributed to a larger pool of applicants than in previous years, he said the university’s recruiting methods do not target unrealistic applicants.
“It’s counterproductive for us to encourage people into the pool who don’t have a chance of getting in,” he said in a recent interview. “We’ve been very careful to make sure that the [search list] is a good list.”
David Mainero, director of operations at admissions consultancy InGenius Prep, also said he thinks the admissions rate is likely to stay on a donward slope.
"Top colleges are not substantially increasing the size of their incoming classes, and more students are applying to college every year," Mainero said. "International applications will continue to skyrocket, and domestic applications will steadily rise.”
Anna Ivey, founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, said overzealous recruiting to drum up a large application pool causes some colleges to “end up being like car dealers,” but agreed with Fitzsimmons that Harvard’s recruitment strategy is relatively conservative.
Still, Parke P. Muth—former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia who now runs a college consulting business—predicted the University would continue to expand its outreach programs and broaden the applicant pool, and said that the declining acceptance rate shows no signs of slowing.
“Harvard has the impossible task, because if they get more applications, people are going to condemn them, but if they don’t get more applications, especially from low-income kids, they’ll also get condemned,” he said. “But are great students all over the world and U.S., so why not encourage them?”
Experts also pointed to broader trends in higher education and an emphasis on rankings among top schools.
“Schools are in competition, and they’re after ranking rights about who’s the most competitive school in the country to get into,” Muth said. “The reputation you’re the most selective, elite school is going to help you come out No. 1 or 2 in the U.S. rankings.”
The Common Application, used by over 500 colleges, has consolidated the application process, expanding applicant pools and driving down acceptance rates, according to Norman.
“The Common Application makes the process more manageable and it also makes it easier for students to apply to more schools,” she said. “Despite the fact that I don’t always advise it, students will throw in extra schools because it’s easy to apply when they have an essay that they can tweak or there’s no additional essay.”
Ivey, for her part, compared applying to a large number of schools to “throwing spaghetti on the wall, hoping something sticks.”
“That to me is a sign that they’re not being very thoughtful in terms of what they want out of the experience, and of their competitiveness,” she said. “Submitting a thoughtful application for 12 schools is actually very time-consuming.”
However, Muth said he knows one student who applied to 50 colleges in search of the best financial aid, and he encourages lower-income students to apply to a higher number of colleges because “it’s really unpredictable in terms of how aid is going to be packaged.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment, spanning seven of Harvard’s schools and courses, have signed up for the group’s “teach-in” this week, agreeing to speak about divestment to their students amidst demonstrations by activist group Divest Harvard.
Fourteen of the 20 professors who signed up to devote class time to the teach-in also indicated the name of their course; most of the courses listed were not related to issues of the environment or divestment. Faculty members said that, as a result, their advocacy often happened right before or after the course, including talking to students about the argument for divestment and distributing pamphlets with frequently asked questions.
Because the week’s demonstrations, dubbed “Heat Week,” had not been detailed before the beginning of the semester, group members said divestment had not been incorporated into course syllabi.
Group members who have participated said the classroom is the venue where faculty members can be effective in advocating for issues they care about.
“We as a faculty group felt that it was the perfect opportunity that individuals in this profession who recognize the gravity of the situation can act in civil society and in our professional capacity that makes a difference,” Harvard Medical School professor and group member James A. Recht said. While he does not teach in a classroom but rather takes on a supervisory role in his teaching, Recht spoke with some of his students about his support for divestment after clinic rounds this week.
For his part, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in a statement that “we fully support the academic freedom of our faculty.”
Harvard Faculty for Divestment, composed of about 250 faculty members who have signed an open letter urging the University to withdraw its investments in fossil fuel companies, has helped pass out flyers at this week’s demonstrations and plans to hold an open forum on divestment on Friday afternoon.
The “teach-ins” come amid efforts by Divest Harvard, including a sit-in at the headquarters of Harvard Alumni Association, a temporary blockade of entrances to University Hall, and a blockade of Massachusetts Hall that began Sunday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Teaching Campaign is making a final push for signatures on a petition that calls for a 12-student cap on section sizes before delivering it to administrators.
Organizers plan to deliver the petition to Massachusetts Hall—the home of several of Harvard’s central administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust—next week, according to the group’s website.
As of Wednesday, the petition had received 1,827 signatures from a combination of undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and alumni, according to the Teaching Campaign’s website. Members of the movement, which seeks to reduce section sizes to 12 students each, have recently been contacting undergraduate students over House email lists in an effort to bolster the number of signatories.
“We call on the University to fulfill its promises of excellence by committing to a maximum of 12 students per section or lab group,” the petition reads. According to the Teaching Campaign website, the movement has been gathering signatures for over a year.
Aaron T. Bekemeyer, a graduate student involved in the Teaching Campaign, said he thinks turning in the petition will help increase the visibility of the movement.
“I think it is going to make a point about the amount of support we do have,” he said. “And because it won’t just be dropping off the petition, but it will be a number of us dropping it off, I think it will really highlight the importance of us.”
Graduate Student Council President Summer A. Shafer wrote in an email that she is not satisfied with the speed with which Harvard is addressing the movement’s concerns.
“This is a no-brainer for the administration. Of issue is the pace with which they'll make the changes faculty, students, alumni, and graduate students have asked for,” she wrote.
The graduate student movement has gained momentum in the last few months as several departments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have endorsed the campaign. More than 10 departments, including History and English, have announced their support for capping section sizes at 12 students.
The renewed effort to gather signatories and increase publicity for the upcoming event at Mass. Hall coincides with the beginning of a separate movement among graduate students to form a union. In early April, some students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences said they had started organizing to unionize.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Living at the epicenter of the weeklong Divest Harvard blockade, leaving for class has become a multi-step process for Massachusetts Hall resident John D. Bowers ’18: “We sort of have a system worked out at this point where we will knock on the door before opening so we don’t bang anybody on the head,” he said.
As Divest Harvard blocks senior University administrators from accessing their offices inside of Mass. Hall in protest of Harvard's investment in the fossil fuel industry, the activist group has tried to engage the 14 freshmen who reside on the fourth floor of the campus’s oldest standing building.
According to Bowers, the freshmen who live on the fourth floor of Mass. Hall were contacted by both Divest Harvard activists and Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard, weeks in advance of the protest. According to Ranen, the group “reached out to every single one of the students and the proctor assuring them that they would be able to go in and out and offered to meet with them individually before it started."
“We as the inhabitants of Mass. Hall knew exactly what was going to happen before it happened,” Bowers said. “There was no fear or confusion—there was very sort of natural progression into the protests.”
Now that the "Heat Week" demonstration has started, the freshman residents walk in and out of their dormitory as protesters stage a blockade at their doors.
The entrance to Mass. Hall is limited to a set list of students during the protest week to ensure the safety and security of the fourth floor residence, according to Ranen, although the protest began with a slight hiccup: At the start of the protest on Sunday night, the Harvard University Police Department did not yet have a list, and some students were initially denied entry.
Now allowed in and out of their building, some Mass. Hall residents have helped the protesters stage their demonstration. Charlie A. Gibson ’18, a resident of Mass. Hall who has attended Divest Harvard meetings in the past and was involved with this week’s protests, said freshmen in the building were divided on the question of whether to allow Divest Harvard to hang a large banner from their windows. Ultimately, only a handful of rooms decided to allow Divest Harvard to hang banners from their windows.
While several students praised Divest Harvard for being proactive, others expressed dissatisfaction over the interruption of their daily routines.
“Divest Harvard could have been more disruptive in terms of noise, but I still consider the clutter outside our only entry a nuisance,” Mass. Hall resident Daniela A. Veloza ’18 wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In preparation for contract negotiations that will tentatively begin in the next three weeks, leaders of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers convened with University administrators and faculty during two “pre-negotiation” information meetings focused on health care last week, according to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger.
Jaeger originally predicted that contract negotiations would begin in late March, but he said Wednesday that HUCTW and the University have only begun assembling negotiating teams in the last two weeks, informally meeting to discuss the “content, schedule, and structure” of the upcoming talks.
The “pre-negotiation” sessions held last week, which separately featured Economics professor David M. Cutler ’87 and School of Public Health professor Meredith B. Rosenthal, each drew around 50 participants and focused on healthcare issues, Jaeger said. He added that they served as “warm-ups” for official negotiations.
In a newsletter from University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, HUCTW and University meeting organizers said in a joint statement that the information meetings addressed “the use and impact of patient cost-sharing features in employer-based health plans,” as well as “promising new approaches by employers for managing the total cost of health care.”
“We’ve had some difficulty with healthcare issues in the past few years, and there’s certainly the possibility that these negotiations will be challenging on some of the issues about the health plans,” Jaeger said. “To start by getting exposed to some new ideas together, union and management people, was actually invigorating.”
At the meetings, Cutler and Rosenthal presented recent trends in healthcare, utilizing case studies from other large employers regarding healthcare plans and policy, Jaeger said. Other topics of discussion included the possible implementation of greater wellness programming as a new initiative and the impact of increased patient cost sharing.
“It’s wonderful that we have that kind of expertise right here, and we can talk to these faculty members who are trusted both by the union and by Harvard management and really by the community at large,” said Amanda H. Wininger, a member of the HUCTW executive board and negotiating team. “I think it was a real show of good faith. I think if we could continue in that vein, we would have a really interesting conversation about what happens next with health care at Harvard.”
Jaeger echoed Wininger’s sentiment and stressed the benefit of drawing on the University’s faculty for negotiation preparation.
“I think we agreed all around we were looking for a way to hit the refresh button, and we’re hoping that this did that pretty well,” Jaeger said.
The HUCTW negotiations come a semester after University administrators formally unveiled changes to the University healthcare plan for faculty and nonunion staff last September, citing the burden of rising healthcare costs. The plan included reduced premiums and introduced deductibles for the first time, prompting outcry from members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, some of whom called the new plans “regressive.”
While the health benefits changes for faculty and nonunion staff do not extend to HUCTW, Jaeger said that health care will be a focus of the union's upcoming negotiations.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 70 Harvard Medical School postdoctoral fellows, professors, and administrators signed a letter arguing that recent changes to the University’s health benefits plan may disproportionately burden Harvard postdocs, whose salaries are often lower than many other non-union employees'.
Little more than a week after they attended a town hall meeting on March 16 about the changes, a group of nine postdocs sent a letter to the University Benefits Committee and top Harvard administrators, including Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. In the letter, dated March 27, the postdocs criticized the new health benefits policy, arguing that it potentially increased unpredictable costs and financial burden on postdocs. The letter also called for the creation of a new advisory committee to the UBC, which recommended the recent policy changes that have prompted pushback from faculty members.
UBC Chair and Medical School professor Michael E. Chernew sent the group an email acknowledging that he received the letter. Chernew previously said the March 16 meeting made clear that postdocs “earn substantially less than faculty members in general, and they are concerned that the cost sharing that is imposed on them is particularly burdensome given their income level.”
The group has not heard back from the other administrators, according to two of the letter’s authors.
Kristin Krukenberg, a postdoc and one of the letter’s main signatories, said the benefits changes resulted in potential increased uncertainty and cost-sharing and argued that they harm the financial security of postdocs more than other non-union employees at Harvard, as their incomes are often lower.
“A lot of the concern is that the committee was not fully aware of the circumstances postdocs are in,” she said. “Even if premiums are higher, at least knowing what you have to pay is better.”
The recommended annual salary for Medical School postdocs begins at $42,000 for no years of experience and increases to $55,272 for seven years or more, according to the Medical School's website.
The postdocs' letter argued that offering a plan with more cost predictability is “critical to the financial survival of many low-paid employees,” including postdocs.
Rebeccah Lijek, another of the letter’s main signatories, said that despite her doctor’s recommendations, she chose not to seek physical therapy for a running injury because she cannot “sensibly” afford costs under the new healthcare plans.
“Given my salary as a Harvard Medical School postdoc and given the changes in the 2015 benefits plan, I can no longer sensibly afford that additional care, especially when I am trying to save for my retirement and am saving for a house,” Lijek said.
Signatories of the letter also called for the formation of a new committee comprised of “representatives from all levels of the Harvard employee community, including postdocs” to advise the UBC in creating its proposals.
Krukenberg said the signatories have reached out to other groups on campus, including the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, to get their input on accommodating the plan to lower-income employees. She argued that alleviating the concerns of postdocs is difficult because of the temporal and disparate nature of the group.
“Maybe because it’s temporary, postdocs often feel isolated from the rest of the University community,” she said, “and the responsibilities are not at all standardized.”
The group also sent the letter in an email to Garber, Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier, Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann, Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, and Director of Labor and Employee Relations William J. Murphy.
UBC members have previously indicated that they are considering adopting some changes to the health benefits plan for 2016. When asked for comment, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement that "we and the members of the University Benefits Committee are very interested in hearing everyone’s views so that they all can be thoroughly considered as the UBC plans for the coming year."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2015, at 12:17 a.m.
Night fell on day five of Divest Harvard’s blockade of Massachusetts Hall with the protesters still in place after University President Drew G. Faust offered to meet with demonstrators on the condition that they stop blocking the building’s entrances.
“I would be happy to meet with you and a representative group of your student colleagues when you have ceased disrupting university operations,” Faust wrote in an email on Thursday to Divest Harvard co-founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, according to a copy of the message shared with The Crimson.
Maxmin responded a few hours later with a response signed by the group requesting a meeting with Faust and the Harvard Corporation “to formally negotiate about Harvard’s divestment.” Faust, who normally works out of Mass. Hall, wrote back late Thursday evening.
“I am sorry you have again chosen to decline my offer to meet. I am also sorry you have chosen to mischaracterize my invitation as an offer to ‘negotiate,’” Faust wrote. “I remain open to meeting with you again to hear your views, just as the university has made every effort to allow you and your colleagues to express your position despite the substantial disruption your activities have caused to the many people who work hard to serve Harvard, its students, faculty and staff.”
The protesters, who began their planned “Heat Week” protests on Sunday, are demanding that the University divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies.
In addition to their ongoing demonstration at Mass. Hall, roughly two dozen protesters from the group blocked entrances to University Hall for the second time this week, from about 6:15 a.m. on Thursday to about 5 p.m.
Faust wrote in her first Thursday email to the activist group that she had not received a request for a meeting from students until she saw a sign held by students on Wednesday afternoon at Emerson Hall, where demonstrators silently stood in protest outside a lecture she was introducing.
Faust made a similar offer to meet with student protesters when they occupied Mass. Hall in February on the condition that they vacate the building, but the protesters declined. Faust has repeatedly argued against divestment as a means to address climate change.
On Thursday morning, many Divest Harvard members gave speeches for the group’s “students day.” In the afternoon, the group held a student open forum outside of Mass. Hall and also staged a demonstration in the Yard, taping fossil fuel company logos to the John Harvard statue.
Divest Harvard’s Thursday actions follow several days of protest. The group organized a similar blockade of University Hall on Tuesday that lasted until protesters left after about four hours. Tuesday’s University Hall protest drew little response from administrators, who went to work in other locations around campus.
Cornel R. West ’73 and Tim P. McCarthy ’93 are scheduled to visit the Divest Harvard protests on Friday. The group plans to end its “Heat Week,” which also included a close to two-day occupation of the Harvard Alumni Association in addition to the blockades, with a final rally at 6 p.m. at the Science Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Three errors and five walks plagued the Harvard baseball team Wednesday afternoon as the team allowed eight unearned runs in a loss to Boston College, 13-10. Playing its sixth game in five days, Harvard had to use six pitchers in the team’s third consecutive loss. Following Monday’s loss to UMass in which it left 12 runners on base, the Crimson (16-17 overall, 5-7 Ivy League) was able to bounce back on offense against the Eagles (18-18, 6-11 ACC).
“We were pretty poised in the box,” Harvard coach Bill Decker said. “Monday was like a hangover Monday for us. I told the staff I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years and that was one of the top five [worst offensive performances].”
Harvard jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the top of the first. Senior centerfielder Mike Martin started the scoring, taking Eagles starter Kyle Dunster deep to lead off the game. Sophomore shortstop Drew Reid continued his hot hitting, doubling before being driven in by junior second baseman Mitch Klug.
Dunster was pulled after just two-thirds of an inning and was replaced by junior lefty Tyler Hinchliffe, who shut down the Crimson for the rest of the first and the next three frames.
Freshman Ian Miller got the start for Harvard but he also did not make it past the second inning when, after being held scoreless in the first inning, Boston College rallied for three runs in both the second and third innings.
In the second, Miller loaded the bases and a sac fly by sophomore Johnny Adams cut the Crimson lead in half. A flyball to Reid looked like it would end the frame but the ball bounced off the sophomore’s glove, allowing two more runs to score.
“As an infielder and as a position player, it’s tougher to see errors out there,” Reid said.
Junior Sean O’Neill surrendered three more runs in the third on two doubles and a triple before the Harvard offense finally got to Hinchliffe in the fifth. After the junior walked two, unleashed a wild pitch, and allowed a single to Martin, Klug hit a sac fly that Pellagrini Diamond’s spacious center field kept in the yard. Captain Ethan Ferreira subsequently crushed a double to cut the Eagles’ lead to one.
The wheels started to come off for the Crimson in the bottom of the fifth. With a runner on second and one out, a routine fly ball to right field appeared to be dropped on the exchange from Connor Quinn’s glove to his right hand but the umpires ruled that the freshman never established possession.
“We have to catch that infield popup in the second inning and that ball in right field,” Decker said. “But that’s what baseball is, you have to minimize that and offensively, you have to build on the positive things that happened.”
The error came back to bite Harvard as sophomore Michael Strem drove in a run and Adams lined an offering from junior Joey Sliepka over the left field wall for a three-run homer to put BC ahead 10-5. The Eagles offense tacked on to its lead with three more runs in the sixth and submariner Travis Ferrick slammed the door on Harvard as the shadows crept in on the Heights.
BC was able to turn a 4-6-3 double play in the seventh to stop a Crimson rally that had produced three runs, leaving it ahead five. As Harvard sought to make a comeback, a bright spot on the mound was junior Shaun Rubin. The lefty worked two scoreless innings, surrendering just one hit and striking out three.
Freshman Austin Black picked up the first two hits of his collegiate career and drove in two runs. The top of the Crimson’s order bounced back after struggling to pick up key hits in Monday’s loss to UMass. Harvard’s one through six hitters combined for 10 hits and nine RBIs.
“For the offense, I think we’re trying to stay through the middle, trying to hit the ball in the deepest part of the ballpark,” Reid said. “It’s a finicky game like that, a little adjustment like that can work big time. I think we’re really coming into our own and swinging the bats pretty well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, the Harvard softball team (17-17, 8-4 Ivy) will travel to Boston College (16-18, 1-11 ACC) for a non-conference matchup on Thursday and will return home for a pair of doubleheaders versus Ancient Eight rival Yale (7-17, 2-8 Ivy) on Saturday and Sunday.
After a nine-game winning streak that included seven victories over Ivy League competition, the Crimson has dropped its last two games. Most recently, Harvard dropped its first game on home soil–a 6-2 loss to Boston University on Tuesday.
“We need to show up on Thursday ready to play,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We have a great opportunity on Thursday to get dialed in for the weekend. We’ve had strong weekends the last two weekends, and we need to bring that back [against Yale].”
It is do-or-die time now for Harvard, which currently sits in second place behind Dartmouth in the North Division of the Ivy League. With just eight conference games remaining on the schedule, four of those this weekend against Yale, the Crimson will need to get back on the right track if it wants to secure a spot in the Ivy League Championship Series at the end of the season.
Before it can set its sights on the Bulldogs this weekend, Harvard must first battle Boston College, who the Crimson beat twice in last year’s campaign by a combined three runs.
“Midweek games provide the opportunity to improve the things that were weak from the previous weekend and get things sharpened and ready for Saturday,” senior pitcher Laura Ricciardone said. “This team will need some strong performance leadership from its senior class and every pitcher on the pitching staff will need to be effective in our outings.”
That pitching staff has faltered slightly as of late, giving up an average of six earned runs per game in its last three outings. Ricciardone, who leads the Crimson with a 2.63 ERA in 16 starts, will help provide a much-needed spark to the Harvard pitching corps.
However, the Slidell, La, native will have experience on her side in facing Yale, as Ricciardone recorded all four wins in Harvard’s four matchups against the Bulldogs last year.
Even more remarkable, the senior faced 74 Yale batters in those four games and did not give up a single earned run.
The Crimson will also rely heavily on its seniors on the offensive end, including senior infielder Katherine Lantz, who brings a nine-game hit streak into Thursday’s contest against Boston College.
A Harvard offense that managed only two runs in each of its last two games, both ending in losses, will need Lantz to continue her current offensive tear, as she leads the Crimson in home runs, triples, and slugging percentage.
Harvard will need its offense firing on all cylinders, as Yale brings a pitching staff that has allowed the least home runs and walks in the Ancient Eight. While the Crimson hopes to capitalize on experience, the Bulldogs will rely on youth as freshman Francesca Casalino and sophomore Lindsay Efflandt spearhead a rotation with a combined ERA of 5.05.
This upcoming stretch of games for the Harvard squad should feel slightly familiar, at least for the upperclassmen who played in last year’s campaign.
In the 2014 season, the Crimson carried a program-record 18 consecutive wins into a weekday faceoff with Boston University, where the Terriers snapped Harvard’s streak with a 2-1 win. The Crimson went on to lose three of its last four and finished in second place in the Ivy League North Division.
This year, the team faces a similar challenge, as it currently sits in second place in the Ancient Eight following a loss to Boston University.
Ricciardone, insists that her team is certainly capable of making a run at the end-of-season Ivy League Championship Series.
“We just have to consistently put all three facets of the game together [offense, pitching, defense] and fight for each game,” the senior said.“We have had to battle adversity throughout this season and the last Ivy weekends will be no different. Nothing will be given, we’ll earn each win, but we believe in our ability to do so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 34 Harvard men’s tennis team (17-6, 3-1 Ivy League) will finish its regular season with matches against Yale on Friday and Brown on Sunday. The Crimson will be playing away in New Haven but will be hosting the Bears at the Murr Center for its Senior Day on Sunday.
The four seniors who will be honored, co-captain Denis Nguyen, co-captain Alex Steinroder, Shaun Chaudhuri and Henry Steer have been a large part of Harvard’s 77-22 record over their four years. With three trips to the NCAA tournament under their belts, the seniors also hope to steer the Crimson to the NCAAs one last time.
“It’s a big weekend for our seniors,” Steinroder said. “It’s our last home match, it’ll be fun but also sad that we’re leaving. We’ve had four good years together so [the matches this weekend] should be exciting for us.”
After a close 4-3 win against Princeton last weekend, Harvard is battling for second place in the Ivy League with Dartmouth (11-10, 2-2) and Princeton (18-6, 3-2). After losing the doubles point against the Tigers, the Crimson fought back to win all four points of singles play against the Tigers to move into sole possession of second place.
“We’re hoping to keep improving our doubles play because we dropped a couple of doubles points [last weekend]”, Harvard coach Dave Fish '72 said. “If we end up being productive [in the doubles] we won’t have to win four singles matches.”
Fish stressed that the margins were thin and that the team’s chances could hinge on small shifts in its strategy and approach.
“Essentially what the team is doing is to try and take the lessons they learned competitively and put them into action,” he said. “I guess this sounds boring but it’s really about getting just a few more points.”
Harvard’s previous matches against the Bulldogs and Brown have been victories. The Crimson defeated Yale 4-0 earlier in the season, with clean sweeps of both singles and doubles matches. The Bears lost to Harvard last year with a 4-2 defeat.
“We’ve beaten Yale earlier this year and we beat Brown last year pretty easily,” Steinroder said. “But they’re both good teams and we know they’re both going to fight really hard because all teams in the Ivy League are good and they’re all tough. If [Brown and Yale] commit and focus on playing well, it will definitely be two very close matches.”
The Bears and Bulldogs were both defeated by Cornell, 7-0 and 5-2,  respectively,  last week. The Big Red fell to Harvard earlier in the season, 4-3, putting the Crimson in a comfortable position heading into the weekend. Harvard boasts a 11-2 record at home this season, its only two losses coming from No. 23 Vanderbilt and No. 28 Columbia.
Harvard’s No. 1 player, Nguyen, will face Yale’s No. 1 Tyler Lu. Harvard’s co-captain is ranked 34th in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and has an overall record of 16-11 along with a 10-7 record in dual matches. The Crimson’s first All-American since 2005 last year, Nguyen will hope to remake an appearance in the men’s singles draw.
“Nguyen, our number one, played a fine match last weekend,” Fish said. “He’s going to play a sophomore who’s been known to give trouble before, a very fast and talented player at Yale, Tyler Lu.”
Nguyen will pair up with sophomore Brian Yeung in doubles. The duo has notched 19 wins this year and are ranked No. 17 in the country. Yeung also performs solidly as a singles player, owning a 17-6 record overall. The sophomore has perfect marks at the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 6 positions and has won eight of his last 10 matches.
“For us, it means if we can maintain our present ranking nationally, then we could earn a spot in the NCAA tournament,” Fish said. “In addition to trying to wind the Ivy League, you’re trying to get in the NCAA tournament. It’s a real mark of accomplishment for any team.”

I never thought that my sense of smell was terribly good, but I’m pretty certain that the yard smells like poop. To the displeasure of many Harvard students, at least once every semester a wave of aromatized feces seems to invade the everyone’s nostrils.
Nobody really knows why this happens. During my time here, I’ve casually asked some friends for their opinions. An interesting hypothesis is that once the winter’s layers of snow melt away, old pet droppings become exposed to the outside world. Another friend hypothesized that the Divest Heat Week protesters probably haven’t bathed in weeks, although that’s surely not true—it’s likely only been a few days since they’ve last bathed.
As the respected investigative reporter that I am, I felt like it was my duty as a Crimson Kid and a Harvard student to get to the bottom of this controversy.
Last week, I tried to interview a man driving what could only be described as a brown-dust-spewing machine on why the particulate being expelled from his tractor-like contraption smelled so bad, but I couldn’t really hear him over the rattle of the engine.
Feeling defeated, I sent Harvard Yard Ops an email. When Anthony J. Pacillo, Associate Director of Residential Facilities, told me that “the smell you may be referring to is the ‘organic fertilizer’ we use in the Yard,” I was shocked.
I just stood there for many minutes, staring into the computer screen. How could the fertilizer be the culprit? How could the substance we look up to for bringing grass (and thus summer happiness) to the Northeast be so aromatically abrasive?
I would have asked more questions, but a tear started to roll down my cheek and I replied with a simple “thank you” in fear of my waterfalling tears damaging my keyboard. I then went to the Google and did some research. I first googled “poop plants,” but that gave me many unpleasant results. I then looked up “manure fertilizer” (a far more scientific term). After literally two minutes of research, I found from an article on fertilizers from the San Francisco Chronicle that manure “makes an excellent fertilizer and soil conditioner,” which is dandy.
However, my research also made me privy of something far more alarming than a stinky odor. According to the article, manure-based fertilizer is rich in “the presence of harmful pathogens [and] parasites.” I’m no scientist, but I’m pretty sure pathogens and parasites can make people sick.
Is Harvard trying to intentionally make its students sick? Is this part of a larger plot by the University to funnel ill children into the new CVS and buy increased amounts of medicine? This warrants future in-depth investigation…
