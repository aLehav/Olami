After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The music video for “Up in the Air” by Thirty Seconds to Mars features animals and bugs, celebrities and athletes, and fancy tricks and performances. The band members—Jared Leto, Shannon Leto, and Tomo Miličević—add to the drama of the video with intense stares and deliberate moves. It was directed by Bartholomew Cubbins, a.k.a. Jared Leto (a pseudonym inspired by a Dr. Seuss character).
The video starts off with a seizure trigger warning for people with photosensitive epilepsy, which indicates its incredible level of artistry. The reason for this is that the video is random, colorful, and powerful. The characters of the video are not only the members of the band, but also performers like burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, writer Neil Strauss, Olympic gymnasts McKayla Maroney and Jordyn Wieber, masked figures, drummers, bees, butterflies, zebras, etc…
The diversity of the video participants (human or otherwise) suggests that the only similarity between them all is the beauty they offer. The athletes and performers display their crafts as the animals offer the colors and patterns visible on their flesh. They then throw colorful chalk at each other at the end of the video, as if celebrating their external allure.
The power of the music resonates through the video with provocative imagery. A burlesque dancer rides a mechanical bull. A gap-toothed model named Ashley Smith shows off her cleavage. Images of a lion pacing, drummers harshly beating their drums, and fencers duelling emphasize strength.
The editing makes the short film noteworthy. The images quickly move and the scenes reverse in a sort of organized chaos. “Up in the Air” suggests that objects thrown in the air or sky will return to Earth (as that is the law of gravity). Yet one does not know when and how they will do so.

In each of Andy Warhol’s silkscreen prints of Marilyn Monroe, the vivid colors encapsulate the multifaceted personality of the actual person behind the famous face. After creating the iconic Marilyn face shortly after her death in 1962, Warhol revisited the piece again in 1967, creating a portfolio of ten silkscreen prints in varying hues. Every Monday between Sept. 11 and Oct. 2, the Harvard Art Museums are displaying six of the ten Marilyn screen prints.
At the Art Study Center, visitors can request to see any of the museum’s collection of 249,000 of works of art. Viewing the Marilyn Monroe prints as a group proves to be a unique way to interpret them, according to Mary Schneider Enriquez, Houghton Associate Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.
“He makes her face into something that we see in different ways, in different colors, and because we are able to see so many versions together. We get to see her as someone that is more than a mask and popular image” she said. “I wasn’t able to see this until they were all side by side.”
This collection is a special event at the museum’s Art Study Center, which holds open hours each Monday afternoon. Mary Lister, manager of the Art Study Center, said that she anticipates other interesting programs to come after the Warhol collection. “Sometimes we connect it to a gallery talk[...], where the curatorial colleagues will ask to have specific works up in the space that connect to their theme,” she said.
The showing of Warhol’s pieces at the Study Center is timed to coincide with the American Repertory Theatre’s upcoming show, WARHOLCAPOTE. Unbeknownst to many, Warhol and Capote were great friends, and they recorded a series of conversations over the course of two months in the late 1970’s. The A.R.T. is also opening itself up to collaboration with the museums, hosting a talk after the show. Schneider Enriquez, who will be speaking at the talk, said it’s crucial for the two to have an open dialogue about the practice of creating art and performing in the past and present.
Schneider Enriquez said that she sees the programs as ways to explore connections between visual art and performance. “In many ways, Andy was a performer. He presented himself in a certain way for years and years [and] had many followers. But he also was an artist,” she said. “Having this topic is the perfect opportunity to think about Warhol’s presence in 20th century art.”

Three years after Vampire Weekend’s magnum opus, “Modern Vampires of the City,” the band’s guitarist, keyboardist, and producer Rostam Batmanglij announced he was leaving the group to pursue his own ventures. After producing other people’s songs for years, Rostam finally released a solo album that shows who he really is. While “Half-Light” has its flaws, it succeeds in showing exactly how valuable Rostam is as a producer and instrumentalist, as well as in highlighting his songwriting craft.
As one might expect given Rostam’s background, “Half-Light”’s biggest strength is its production. Rostam plays almost all of the instruments on every song, and as a result, it sounds a lot like his work in Vampire Weekend. The sound is far more subdued than the baroque-indie-pop Vampire Weekend is known for, but nonetheless it’s strikingly similar. Songs like “Don’t Let It Get to You” sound a lot like previous Vampire Weekend songs but with a more electronic bend. Rostam’s more recent production credits are diverse, from Carly Rae Jepsen and Charli XCX to Frank Ocean and Solange, so it wasn’t clear how he’d sound on his solo debut. Apparently the answer was a superior Perfume Genius. Rostam’s voice glides along the beat in a similar manner, but he has the sensibilities to make the instrumentation fascinating. On every song, there’s a glowing, warm backing that fills “Half-Light” with a cheerful tone reminiscent of groups like The Magnetic Fields, although with less depressing lyrics. Songs like “Woods” buzz and compliment the wistful and ethereal quality of Rostam’s voice. The ensuing mesh makes the album texturally vibrant.
One of Vampire Weekend’s most unique traits was how happy they sounded. Rostam continues this effect on “Half-Light” with songs that are joyous, wistful, or curious. His voice is light and airy and creates a general feeling of comfort. Rostam sounds far less assertive than Ezra Koenig does, however; he sounds like Taylor Swift on “1989.” This isn’t a problem at all, actually. Instead, it makes “Half-Light” a romantic exploration of youth, an avenue that Vampire Weekend never ventured down. Rostam uses many of these songs, especially “Don’t Let It Get to You” and its reprise, as motivational pieces to emphasize these emotions. Even the saddest songs express a general longing more than anything else. “Half-Light” is an exploratory album in this sense.
While his voice suits the material, however, Rostam can’t quite vocally perform on the level the album needs. Lacking Koenig’s vocal chops, Rostam often sounds submerged within his bright production. While the instrumentation is of high enough quality to make up for this, it still is a problem on songs like “When” and “Warning Intruders,” on which he sounds nearly incomprehensible. While Rostam’s voice isn’t bad per se, it’s so deemphasized that he always sounds like he’s singing background vocals without a lead.
Despite this shortcoming, Rostam’s production and cheeriness carry the album. Every song is a delightful listen, and it’s in large part because of the way Rostam has masterfully arranged his instruments. The way he vocally glides along the album reminiscing about New York and his love life is hypnotic and heart-warming. “Half-Light” is a delightful electropop album, and even though it was such a departure from much of Rostam’s previous work, somehow it puts all his strengths on display. Throughout “Half-Light,” Rostam showed what he really brought to Vampire Weekend. Even though he doesn’t stand out as a singer, his songwriting craft and the fact that he’s one of the best multi-instrumentalists of the century shine through and help make “Half-Light” a great listen.

To the Editor:
I sympathize with Professor John Stauffer, who has made himself a scapegoat in the case of Michelle Jones.  But his letter to The Crimson is an attempt to blame the messenger.
A dose of veritas:
Stauffer writes, “In his article, ‘From Prison to Ph.D.,’ published last week in the New York Times, Eli Hager argued that Harvard University did not give Michelle Jones a fair review, owing to her criminal record.”
Actually the writer makes no such argument. He quotes members of the Harvard History Department criticizing the decision, and he quotes others explaining it. The officials who had the final word declined to be interviewed or to answer written questions.
He continues, “In developing his argument, Hager said that ‘top Harvard officials’ rejected Jones’s admission ‘out of concern that her background would cause a backlash among rejected applicants, conservative news outlets, or parents of students.’ This is simply wrong.”
Stauffer doesn’t specify what part of this excerpt he deems wrong, but the fact that Jones’s enthusiastic reception by the History Department was overruled by top officials—and the reasons for that decision—are copiously sourced. Read the article.
He claims that the article “misrepresents what I emphasized in my interview, which was that Jones’s Ph.D. application garnered widespread support, including my own, despite concern about possible backlash.”
The widespread support for Jones at Harvard was the crux of the story. Professor Stauffer’s own position on Jones’s candidacy, which we quoted at length, was a bit more ambiguous than simple “support.” “If officials who take a careful look at the case decide that Harvard should move forward,” he and his co-author wrote, “then we think that the university should do everything in its power and ability to welcome Jones here and support her, and we are indeed happy to play a part in that effort.” What prompted officials to “take a careful look at the case” was the memo Professor Stauffer co-authored, which questioned whether she had minimized her crime “to the point of misrepresentation.”
Stauffer alleges that “Hager further suggested that the memo my colleague, Daniel Carpenter, and I circulated was a highly unusual procedure.”
No, he said that the decision to overrule the judgment of a department regarding the admission of a Ph.D. student was highly  unusual. Which no one disputes.
Finally, for the record, the Marshall Project is a news organization that reports on the criminal justice system. We are “an advocacy group” only in the sense that we advocate honest, independent, fact-based, and fair journalism.
Bill Keller is the Editor-In-Chief of the Marshall Project.

Peyton Manning is a great football player, but what does he know about pizza? Tallying more career passing yards and touchdown passes than any other quarterback in the history of the National Football League, the five-time Associated Press MVP and fourteen-time Pro Bowl selection still holds more than 50 league records. It’s unclear if Manning knows pizza as well as he obviously knows football, but this hasn’t stopped Papa John’s Pizza from showcasing him in their television advertisements.
With that winning smile and down-to-earth Southern swagger, Manning has starred in Papa John’s commercials for the past several years, advertising with red aprons and NFL mascots a product in which he has no professional expertise. It’s all very charming, but it’s downright silly to think Peyton Manning is qualified to tell us the best pizza to buy. So why did Papa John’s bypass actual pizza critics to make Manning, the legendary NFL quarterback, their spokesperson?
Since Peyton Manning is so revered by generations of football fans the world over, his opinion on pizza gains credence because of who he is, not what he actually adds to the conversation. As Manning demonstrates, we have a habit of basing a person’s credibility on their identity and not on their ideas.
Another Manning shows just how far this fallacy extends beyond football and pizza. Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf’s decision to rescind Chelsea Manning’s appointment as an Institute of Politics Visiting Fellow has drawn criticism from everyone from students to media critics to Twitterverse belligerents. In response to pressure from high-ranking Central Intelligence Agency officials, Elmendorf, now notoriously, declared Manning’s appointment “a mistake”—a miscalculation in comparing how much she would add to the Kennedy School’s intellectual forum as a military whistleblower versus how much she would contradict the School’s values as a convicted criminal. Most of the ensuing outcry and approbation, however, has focused less on what Manning offers the Kennedy School than who she is. We seem to care less about her ideas than her identity.
Things got personal from the start. Manning responded to her canceled invitation with a sardonic tweet about being Harvard’s first “disinvited trans woman visiting... fellow,” whereas conservatives criticized Harvard for extending the fellowship to a national traitor in the first place. On either side of the controversy, the Dean’s decision has been condemned or praised largely because of who Manning is—in terms of her gender identity or criminal record—not what she would contribute to the IOP’s intellectual discussions. This Manning may not be selling pizza, but we still far too readily award—or rescind—her credibility by judging her identity before evaluating her ideas.
Alarmingly, this habit isn’t limited to TV spots and newspaper controversies; it’s steadily crept into Harvard culture. In discussion sections, lecture halls, and even online forums, students without the proper identity credentials can no longer credibly opine on controversial issues—regardless of the intellectual merit of those opinions. As the logic goes, I must be a female minority to have a credible opinion about PC culture, since white males, having never experienced the brunt of political incorrectness, cannot possibly have a compelling stance on the issue. I must be a female to be a feminist, since men have no conception of a woman’s struggles and simply sabotage the movement they claim to support. I must be a racial minority to talk about prejudice, since a white person can never understand minorities’ struggles. And if I am so unfortunate as to be “privileged,” I am disqualified from commenting on practically any issue—from final clubs to campus values—affecting Harvard today. If my identity doesn’t make the cut, in other words, my ideas don’t matter.
It is undoubtedly impossible for a white student to fully understand the struggles of a black student, a male to grasp the difficulties of being female, a middle-class student to fathom the strain of inner-city poverty, or for any person to completely appreciate a situation they’ve never experienced. Empathy is certainly feasible, but it’s ultimately an insufficient substitute for personal experience.
This lack of first-hand knowledge, nonetheless, shouldn’t disqualify thinkers from contributing to controversial conversations. Expertise and intellectual insight aren’t contingent upon race, background, sexual orientation, or gender, so it makes little sense to discredit ideas simply because of who came up with them. Such discussions actually draw strength from views outside the affected circle, which offer innovative ideas and solutions frequently difficult to see from the inside. If, however, we insist on maintaining discriminatory standards for who can credibly opine on such issues as discrimination, minority rights, and campus culture, we’ll end up with a circular quibble over identities, and not a productive debate about ideas.
We don’t have to admire, agree with, or identify with someone—let alone name them an IOP Visiting Fellow—in order to recognize their ideas as valuable additions to the difficult debates that should happen at a university like Harvard. If we can remember to consider the weight of someone’s insight over the weight of their identity, we may not end up with better Papa John’s TV commercials, but we’ll certainly end up with better pizza.

The Harvard College House system can count its successes in the friendships forged and community fostered. Its success can also be measured in the number of lives saved and the many students who otherwise have few other spaces to belong to at Harvard. As an Asian American woman who transferred to Harvard College in 2008, I have seen the difference that the House staff—in particular resident tutors, deans, and other support staff—make both in diversity and inclusion and in mental health support by being present among and working with the undergraduates in the House community.
Today, I’m in my fifth year as a Ph.D. student. I am paid a stipend by Harvard to conduct research in the climate sciences and agriculture. The majority of resident tutor positions at Harvard are staffed by graduate students like me: compensated by housing and meals in the dining hall and tasked with interacting with students as emotional, social, and academic resources.
As a resident tutor in Mather House over the last three years, I dealt directly with several cases of potential self-harm among undergraduates. More than once, I was designated the first-responder. I left my position last July because I realized that I was not professionally trained to find a dead body behind a dorm room door or to console a distressed, let alone psychotic, student. Not only were we unprepared for these situations, but we were often completely unsupported in their aftermath.
Despite our lack of training, we were unable to say no to the responsibilities we are tasked with. This system works in part by exploiting our conviction that it is a moral obligation to mentor and help our undergraduates, one that may feel especially strong for those of us from underrepresented backgrounds. And Harvard pays us in kind, with food and housing—compensation that is far below the cost of hiring professionals who are trained to deal with psychiatric emergencies, to ghostwrite recommendation letters, or to counsel students on distress associated with inclusion and belonging.
This is how Harvard works.
Instead of matching clearly delineated responsibilities with both appropriate compensation and an employee who is trained for the position, Harvard instead relies on the untrained compassion of its graduate students. It depends on the tension that the graduate stipend is meager enough for graduate students to see housing and food to be a boon, worth any cost to our own mental health, time, and the research activities that are our primary occupation. One does not need to look far at Harvard to see severely under compensated labor, marketed as a resume-building or “social justice” position.
I recently inquired about the details for the newly-announced Diversity Fellow position specified for graduate students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. I was told that for an expected commitment for 10 to 15 hours per week, the compensation would be $3,000 for the full year in addition to weekly meals at Dudley House. Over the eight months of the school year, this stipend would amount to below Massachusetts minimum wage, even without considering the occasional 20-hour weeks cited by the ad. That only GSAS graduate students are targeted warrants scrutiny: Why would Harvard seek out full-time graduate employees for additional work that is clearly anywhere between quarter to full-time, without adequate compensation?
A university is first and foremost a research institution with a teaching mission. Recognizing the diversity-related problems that stand in the way of this mission, Harvard has also committed to mitigating the socioeconomic, racial, and gender-based inequalities that are endemic to American society and rarefied within the academy. But the critical hard work of fulfilling this commitment rides on the goodwill of certain students spending valuable time away from their research. Graduate students staffing these types of positions, often from underrepresented groups in our community, are the ones who may not only need the additional money most but may also feel the strongest moral obligation to inform institutional change toward ameliorating inequalities—all at the expense of their research and teaching careers.
With inadequate compensation for these diversity and inclusion support positions, Harvard perpetuates and exacerbates the very problems it set out to solve by creating these positions.
The Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging wrings its hands over what it means to belong, and indeed, defining these feelings is difficult. But the starting point of these problems—why so many of us have a hard time belonging on this campus—can be traced to the University’s treatment of its labor on campus.
If not graduate students as resident tutors or Diversity Fellows, then who would fill these very necessary positions? Our undergraduate students would be better served if a psychiatric medic were on-call within the Houses and the first responder in cases of possible self-harm. They would be better served by professional preventative mental health resources and therapists equipped to work with students from underrepresented backgrounds. They would be better served if those working across our campus were professionally trained with compensation and benefits befitting the number of hours worked and skills required.
Our graduate students would be better served if the University administration respected the critical teaching and research work we do and adequately compensated us for the additional work that they recognize needs to be done. The Harvard community deserves better than these administrative and performative stopgap solutions to some of the most difficult issues facing academia today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 10 percent of Harvard’s registered groups were put on probation last Thursday after club leaders failed to attend the annual student leader training. While we agree with critics that the penalty is harsh, we also believe that it was a reasonable action, and we are hopeful that these actions will reduce the redundancy in Harvard organizations.
The Office of Student Life communicated training opportunities as early as this past spring semester. Although Harvard students are extremely busy, we do believe that each group could have found at least one student leader with an open slot on their calendar four months later.
The incentives for attending the student leader training were also quite high. The OSL has over $300,000 of funding that groups not on probation can apply for. It also makes Harvard rooms available for bookings for these organizations. We therefore urge student groups to attend meetings and trainings that are marked as mandatory and have important repercussions on the breadth of a club’s freedom.
Despite the preventability of this situation, however, we are aware and sympathetic of the difficulties that this freeze in funding has created for active groups such as the Black Students’ Association, the Association of Black Harvard Women, Harvard Hong Kong Society, and the a capella group the Harvard Opportunes.
It is highly possible, however, that many of the groups on probation are inactive or mismanaged. The College recognized over 442 recognized student organizations before the probation, which is an incredibly high number for a student population of 6,700 students. Putting groups on probation will allow help reduce redundancies by filtering out those without effective leadership structures.
As September draws to a close, we remind groups that are now on probation that they should attend the make-up training on October 4. Attending this training will restore them to all the benefits from which they are currently excluded. Trainings may be a lot of work, but so is looking for money and space without Harvard’s help.

Harvard will honor rapper and actor LL Cool J, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, and several others with the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal—the University’s highest honor for contributions to African and African-American culture— next month.
The ceremony, scheduled for Oct. 4 in Sanders Theatre this year, is an annual event that recognizes preeminent thinkers, businesspeople, politicians, and artists.
This time around, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Microsoft Chairman John Thompson, artist Kara Walker, and Ford President Darren Walker will also be recognized. In years past, University President Drew G. Faust has presented awards, alongside African and African American Studies professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and department chair Lawrence D. Bobo.
The Du Bois Medal was first presented in 2000, and past winners include Oprah Winfrey, Muhammad Ali, Maya Angelou, Steven Spielberg, and Chinua Achebe.
In 2015, former U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. and hip-hop artist Nas were among nine to win the Medal.
“These are the things the kids need to see,” Nas said in his awards speech.

More than 15,000 people have signed an online petition condemning the Kennedy School of Government for rescinding a fellowship invitation to Chelsea Manning.
Last week, the Institute of Politics announced that Manning, a transgender activist and former U.S. Army soldier who went to prison after leaking classified government documents, would serve as a visiting fellow this fall. But soon after backlash from conservatives and some national security officials, including the current and former directors of the CIA, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf rescinded Manning’s invitation.
The petition, sponsored by a group of Harvard graduates, criticizes Elmendorf’s decision.
“By caving in to pressure from present and former top officials of the CIA, you have jettisoned academic freedom,” the petition reads.
Harvard graduates Victor E. Wallis ’59, Margaret M. Gullette ’62, David G. Gullette ’62, Inez K. Hedges ’68, and Yoshiaki Shimizu ’59 sponsored the petition on the website RootsAction.org. It joins a wave of backlash from some undergraduate groups and commentators across the country denouncing Elmendorf’s decision.
In an interview, Wallis said RootsAction organizers he had worked with before approached him with the idea for the petition and asked him if he would deliver it to the Kennedy School. He agreed and enlisted his friends, the other four Harvard graduates who are supporting the petition, to accompany him.
In addition to finding fault with the Kennedy School for uninviting Manning, the petition criticizes the school for inviting former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to serve as an IOP Visiting Fellow.
“[Spicer] was definitely not a truth teller—he was anything but,” he said. “He had the role of a PR person on behalf of Trump, whose whole campaign was based on lies right from the start.”
Wallis said he approves of Chelsea Manning’s decision to leak because the documents shed light on American practices during wars abroad.
“It's a question of truth-telling,” Wallis said. “Harvard's motto is ‘veritas,’ commitment to the truth. Chelsea Manning disclosed truths that are uncomfortable to those who make U.S. policy, but it's important for people to know them.”
A Kennedy School spokesperson could not be reached for comment.
The petition’s criticism of the Kennedy School for hiring Spicer comes days after hundreds of Harvard alumni signed a letter to University President Drew G. Faust and Elmendorf arguing that the IOP should not have offered Spicer and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski fellowships.
Lewandowski was fired from Trump’s presidential campaign after police charged him with misdemeanor battery.
The five Harvard graduates plan to deliver the petition to the Kennedy School on Friday morning. They will also hold a news conference to discuss the petition.

Artificial intelligence will likely transform the American economy—but not necessarily for the worse, technology leaders and economic experts agreed at the Institute of Politics Thursday.
The forum, called “Will You Still Have a Job When the Robots Arrive?”, featured Google senior counsel Wilson White, IBM “AI Ethics Global Leader” Francesca Rossi, and Kennedy school professor Jason Furman, the former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. Wall Street Journal commentator Greg Ip, who moderated the discussion. challenged the panelists to examine whether AI is in fact an unprecedented technological advance or merely the next step in a longstanding trend toward automation.
“We shouldn’t assume that the headlines we read … ‘Robots are going to take our jobs’… are in fact true,” White said. “These headlines go back to 1800.”
Rossi also emphasized that AI is not a new concept. She pointed to GPS technology as “an algorithm that’s in every AI textbook,” though many people wouldn’t immediately associate the mapping technology with with artificial intelligence.
Furman said he believes AI will ultimately have a positive impact on the economy.
“Ninety percent of what humans did in the year 1900 is now done by machines,” he said. “You invent new technologies, those new technologies create new kinds of jobs, but they also make us richer.”
Furman pointed out that the unemployment rate today is similar to what it was in 1901. White also suggested job losses from AI could be offset by new occupations.
“I absolutely think we should be optimistic,” White said. “I think we have new types of jobs. For example, at Google, we have a whole team that’s AI researchers.”
Furman said that AI is much more likely to displace low-skill, low-wage jobs.
“The higher you are on the education scale, the more likely you’ll be a complement to AI than be substituted by it,” he said. “We need a much better social safety net,” he added.
Citing a Google machine learning system that can detect early forms of diabetic retinopathy, White said that artificial intelligence could also significantly improve aspects of healthcare.
In any case, Rossi said, AI would bring about a “big transformation” in the economy.
“I want to stress the word ‘transformation,’” Rossi said. “The advice to policy makers is to collaborate...to really understand how and what needs to be regulated and with what mechanisms.”
Rachel Y. Hong ’21 said she enjoyed the panel’s discussion of both computer science and public policy issues.
“The fact that it was so interdisciplinary was fascinating to me,” she said.

Vegetarians at Harvard can now eat meat. Or at least something like it.
Beginning today, Clover Food Lab locations in Harvard Square will sell a sandwich featuring a soy-based “meatball”—a chunk of the “Impossible Burger,” an environmentally-friendly, vegan alternative to the traditional hamburger. The product was the subject of an event Thursday hosted by Patrick O. Brown, the founder and CEO of Impossible Foods, which sells the Impossible Burger.
Clover Food Lab, which recently opened a new location in the Science Center, will be the company’s first vendor in Massachusetts.
Impossible Foods has faced regulatory hurdles as it seeks to brings its genetically-engineered “meat” product to a wider market. The Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve the usage of one of the product’s key ingredients, soy leghemoglobin, which produces a protein called heme and gives the burger its meat-like taste. According to internal FDA documents obtained by the ETC Group, the FDA “believes the arguments presented, individually and collectively, do not establish the safety of soy leghemoglobin for consumption.”
At the event, Brown sought to downplay any risks associated with the ingredient. “From a biochemical point of view…..[there] is zero incremental risk,” he said.  He added that “everyone eats thousands of different heme proteins in their diet every single week.”
Following the event, attendees were given the opportunity to taste the company’s invention across the hall at the Science Center Clover. Several attendees at the post-event tasting session said they liked the company’s product, but had differing opinions over whether its taste and feel resembled that of real meat.
Henrique V. G. Vaz ’18 said he enjoyed the meatballs, but highlighted their clear different from real meat. “As long as it tastes good, it’s fine. It doesn’t need to taste exactly like a hamburger,” he said.
Elizabeth N. Gummer ’21 said the meatballs tasted “exactly” like meat, despite what she deemed to be over-seasoning.
In its six years of existence, Impossible Foods has garnered over $250 million in investments and has expanded to over 50 restaurant locations across the United States. Although its product is not yet available online or in grocery stores, the company recently opened a new production facility which will produce over a million pounds of product per month at full capacity.
Brown sought to temper expectations of a wide expansion of the Impossible Burger across the country in the near future, though.
“Let’s remember that even at full capacity, we will still be producing less than one-tenth of one percent of U.S. ground beef production,” he said.
Paramount for the company right now is “establishing that beachhead and building our own brand,” said Brown.
By 2035, the company aims to have “completely eliminated animals from the food system.” And Brown seems fully confident in his company’s capacity to achieve that objective: “Ours is getting better everyday while the cow’s is not,” he said, referring to the Impossible Burger.

Harvard’s endowment posted an 8.1 percent return on its investments for the fiscal year. It’s an improvement on last year’s returns, which saw the University in the red, but Harvard continues to lag behind its peers. Here’s what that means, and why it matters.
This is an updated version of a story from last year.
Harvard’s endowment is the $37.1 billion sum of money the University invests in a variety of financial markets. It’s the largest university endowment in the world. Harvard uses the endowment to fund a number of operating costs and programs and to ensure the University will have that source of funding for the foreseeable future. It’s not a giant bank account that can be spent however Harvard pleases: it’s actually around 13,000 individual funds—the majority of which are restricted in some way—that are invested collectively in a variety of assets.
Harvard takes a percentage of the money from these thousands of invested funds and uses it to fund University programs. That percentage is usually around 5 percent, though Harvard and other big universities have been growing increasingly dependent on their endowments, drawing more money each year. It’s Harvard Management Company’s job to oversee these funds and grow the endowment— essentially, to put more money in Harvard’s pocket through annual investment returns.
Any first semester Economics concentrator can tell you about the beauty of financial growth; as Harvard’s endowment grows larger, the 5 percent that it gives to University operations each year becomes an increasingly larger sum. As the endowment grows, so does Harvard’s capacity to fund research, financial aid, House renewal, and the like.
About a third of Harvard’s annual operating budget comes from the endowment; last year, it contributed around $1.7 billion to Harvard, or over a third of the University’s entire operating budget. That spending supports all the vital functions of the University, from professorships to the library collection to financial aid. Harvard’s 12 schools are funded by the endowment to different extents: The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, for example, receives about 50 percent of its funding from the endowment, while the School of Public Health—many of its expenses provided for by a $350 million gift from 2014—takes only about 15 percent of its budget from the endowment.
Because the endowment is heavily supported by donors, per Massachusetts law, Harvard has to follow the rules and conditions that those donors place on their gifts. And many of those gifts have strings attached; in 2015, 84 percent of the endowment—about $31 billion—had restrictions on how it could be used. That still leaves 16 percent of a multi-billion dollar endowment unrestricted, but oftentimes, donors specify the school they want their gifts to fund. Discretionary funds do exist, though, allowing University President Drew G. Faust to fund projects like [BLANK] Party and the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration.
In short? Donations. The University has raised more than $8 billion in its record-shattering capital campaign so far, and still has a year to go.
When someone donates money to Harvard, they’ll often designate it for a certain program or initiative, like a new professorship. Because both Harvard and the donor want these new programs or research efforts to exist in perpetuity, Harvard invests the donor’s money. The goal is to grow the sum the donor gave to Harvard and use that money to fund the effort forever. (Not every donation goes into the endowment, though: some donors choose to fund more specific short-term short-term projects.)
Of course, the returns on these donations can soon begin to overshadow the donations themselves, so the endowment is a mix of recent gifts and decades-old money earned by investing donations.
While $37.1 billion may seem like a lot of money—and it is—endowment losses can still make an impact on the day-to-day operations of the University. After the world economy crumbled in 2008, Harvard’s endowment plunged by $11 billion, losing more than a quarter of its value. As a result, the University was forced to make sharp cuts to its budgets, laying off hundreds of employees and paring down student services. Hot breakfast still hasn’t returned to the Houses.
When the endowment posted negative 2 percent returns in fiscal year 2016—its lowest returns since the nadir of the financial crisis—a University report warned that budgets could be “constrained” for years to come.
At the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, that has started to manifest. The school announced in the spring it would cut graduate student admissions by 4.4 percent in an effort to manage costs. Then, professors and graduate students learned they would receive a salary increase that is outpaced by the rate of inflation.
Complicating matters is a threat originating not from the endowment, but from Washington D.C. Faust and other university administrators are worried about the threat of deep cuts to federal research funding, which would hinder the academic mission of Harvard’s schools.
That depends on the metric you're using. Some would argue that HMC’s investment returns for fiscal year 2017, 8.1 percent, are a marked improvement on how the firm has performed in recent years. It’s much better than the negative 2 percent Harvard returned in fiscal year 2016.
Even though this year’s returns were higher, the firm’s freshman CEO N.P. Narvekar was not celebratory. He called the firm’s performance for the fiscal year “disappointing” and a sign of “deep structural problems at HMC.”
If you’re relying on a strictly comparative lens — which the firm’s CEO and some experts have cautioned against — Harvard is not stacking up well against its competitors. Once the envy of the finance world, the University is again behind its peers; of approximately 20 large endowments that have reported their returns this year, Harvard has the worst. Most posted double-digit returns for the fiscal year, attributing a boom in public markets to their success. For example, Dartmouth College reported 14.6 percent in returns. And MIT, Harvard’s neighbor down Mass. Ave, posted 14.3 percent.
Everyone is waiting to see what returns Yale — Harvard’s eternal competitor and one of the best-performing endowments in the last decade — posted for fiscal year 2017. Stay tuned.
We don’t know for sure. But the world got a glimpse of HMC’s internal culture in a review conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey and Co. in 2015. In the review, some employees of the firm called the culture “lazy, fat, and stupid.”
The review went on to talk about a“performance paradox” at HMC, where the firm’s employees manage to hit their internal benchmarks while the firm overall struggled. McKinsey said that’s partly because the firm has a history of setting low internal benchmarks for its returns. When those benchmarks are hit, regardless of whether the returns are objectively positive, employees receive bonuses.
HMC’s investment practices have also fallen under increased scrutiny. Until January, HMC used a “hybrid” investment model, employing in-house and external money managers. The cost of that was steep, because Harvard had to pay its finance executives competitively with leading hedge funds, and those salaries add up quickly.
Plus, there’s been a lot of internal turnover at HMC. N.P. Narvekar is the firm’s fourth CEO in a decade, and every new chief executive brings their own ideas to the job. That kind of strategic whiplash can be dangerous when endowment investment rely on a consistent, steady hand, some experts say.
HMC’s new CEO has made more than a few changes to the firm since he took over in December. There are larger, structural changes, like moving the firm away from something called a “silo” investment model, where its managers focus on the performance of individual asset classes like natural resources or private equity. It’s a model that Narvekar has argued stymies the growth of the entire endowment by preventing open dialogue between the firm’s many managers.
HMC is also moving towards an external management system, where the majority of its assets are invested by out-of-house managers. In the process, the firm has laid off half of its internal staff, cutting its payroll down to a little more than 100. That means it’s paying less for in-house staff. But there’s a catch: using external managers is expensive, and may even end up costing the firm more money than if it had kept its managers in house, experts warn.
So he’s instead striking out towards a “generalist” model, which will task all of the firm’s employees with thinking about how to improve the overall value of the endowment.
And he’s putting his money where his mouth is. For fiscal year 2018, compensation at the firm is going to be tied to the performance of the overall endowment in order to align the interests of the firm’s employees with the goal of improving the endowment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Black Students Association published a statement condemning the assault of a black Cornell student last Friday, encouraging students at Cornell, Harvard, and other institutions to support each other in the wake of the attack.
This week, Ithaca Police charged Cornell student John P.A. Greenwood with two misdemeanors related to the assault. A video from the night of the assault depicts several men calling a black student a racial slur, though only one arrest has been reported. Police also charged Greenwood with punching the student.
In their statement, the BSA executive board wrote to support the assault victim and other black students at Cornell.
“The Executive Board of the Harvard Black Students Association vehemently condemns the attackers, and we are calling on the administration of Cornell University to support Black students at Cornell, as well as other students of color that are currently under attack,” the statement, which was published on BSA’s Facebook page, read.
Quoting the statement released by Cornell’s Black Students United, the BSA board wrote, “We are ‘paraded around yet never protected.’ Be sure to reach out to and check on your friends of color at Cornell, here at Harvard, and at other institutions.”
Hasani A. Hayden ’19, the president of BSA, said he felt it would have been “irresponsible” for BSA to neglect to respond to the violent incident at Cornell.
“If it could happen at Cornell, it could happen here at Harvard,” said Hayden.
On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of students occupied Cornell’s Willard Straight Hall, a student union building. At the occupation, Cornell’s Black Students United issued a series of demands to the university’s president, including the expulsion of any student found to be involved in the assault and the conversion of the Psi Upsilon fraternity house to a student cultural center.
Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19, a member of the Undergraduate Council Black Caucus, said he is ready to push “for whatever the black community feels needs to be pushed for” in response to the attack at Cornell, but noted that the caucus had not made any decisions yet.
Whittaker said the UC Black Caucus exists “to protect the black students” and is the institutional bridge black students at Harvard can use to raise their concerns with University administrators.
“It’s 2017, we have the science to back up the impact the ways in which mental health can suffer under racism,” Whittaker said. “What I would like to see is a real examination of what the value of hate speech has on our campus. I think we as a community and we as individuals need to realize how much words and dialogue and discourse impact us everyday.”
Hayden said leaders of black communities across the Ivy League campuses are “working to compile information” and “looking for next steps” in the aftermath of the attack.
A comment posted by the Cornell Black Students’ United Facebook page thanked Harvard’s BSA for “standing in solidarity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As President Donald Trump’s immigration policies have created a sense of crisis for undocumented young people at Harvard and nationwide, Act on a Dream—a student group that advocates for immigration rights—has grown in size and scope amid an outpouring of support.
In the last year, Act on a Dream’s membership has doubled, according to the group’s Co-Cirector Daishi M. Tanaka ’19, with its executive board expanding from six to 13.
The increase, which began at the end of last semester, has allowed Act on a Dream to grow both its presence on campus and activities in the wider Boston area in a time when immigration reform has become a “hot topic,” according to Laura S. Veira-Ramirez ’20, the group's Advocacy Co-chair.
Earlier this month, Trump said he would end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that allowed undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States. More than 60 students at Harvard benefit from the program, and Act on a Dream has made advocating for DACA a priority.
“We decided there was more need for people. We saw there was more of a need to work with administration to make sure that there were resources in place for students,” Veira-Ramirez said.
Almost 70 students attended the group’s first general meeting this year on September 14, according to Tanaka.
“In comparison to our first general meetings a couple years ago, when I started, there were only like seven people [or] eight people in a room talking about these issues, talking about undocumented [issues]. But now, our first general meeting last Thursday, was in a big lecture hall with around 60-70 people,” Tanaka said.
“We were getting so many requests from people to help, but they didn’t know what to do. It was kind of a town hall for people to come and tell us how they want to help us,” Veira-Ramirez added.
Act on a Dream’s second general meeting occurred Thursday with a focus on media messaging, according to Tanaka. A crowd of 30 people attended the meeting in the basement of Memorial Church.
Aside from their increased attendance at meetings and working groups, the organization has added chair positions and committees in the departments of communications, external affairs, and intersectionality to give more students leadership positions, according to Veira-Ramirez.
“The intersectionality committee, which will be starting soon, will engage really all the affinity groups at Harvard and making sure that immigration and undocumented students in different organizations and different areas of campus are being heard,” Tanaka said. “[We want] to make sure that, moving forward, a lot of our goals recognize that immigrant rights are intersectional.”
With the repeal of DACA, however, Act on a Dream has placed emphasis on outreach efforts outside of the Harvard community with a strong focus on contacting legislators as well as partnering with similar organizations at Boston schools like Tufts, according to Veira-Ramirez.
“[We want] to make sure that we have some call-a-thons and letter signing campaigns to make sure we reach some congressmen in this six month period before DACA is repealed,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Tomorrow, the Harvard women’s soccer team begins its defense of the Ivy League championship title.
The Crimson guns for its fourth title in five years as it first takes on Penn (1-5-2, 0-0 Ivy League) for both teams’ conference-opener. Harvard (6-3, 0-0) will be returning home to Jordan Field after having some time to recover from last weekend’s double-header, away games at Villanova and Seton Hall. While the squad fell to Villanova 2-1, it regrouped to blank Seton Hall, 3-0.
“We’re in a good place,” said Crimson coach Chris Hamblin. “It’s good to have a week’s reset after playing three games in five days; that took its toll on us, but the team is resting, recovering, and excited.”
On Saturday afternoon, Harvard looks to get a head start in conference play, coming off the heels of last year’s nail-biting triumph that came down to the last weekend of the season. Going for the crown again, however, will mean adjusting to the loss of last year’s top three scorers, including two-time Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year Midge Purce ’17.
So far, the new squad has proven to be up to the challenge. Senior co-captain Caroline Chagares emphasized the team’s “young talent,” saying “everyone has stepped into new roles” on the team. Hamblin agreed, praising the “positive team culture.”
“The way that the team accepted the young players and really supported them through their transition to college is a huge component [of] how we’re able to be in sync right now,” Hamblin said. “For us, this year, we’re focusing on being the best version of ourselves.”
The Crimson’s best version of themselves is perhaps the version with solid defense. After posting four shutouts in its first eight games, Harvard did it again, recording its fifth shutout of the season against Seton Hall.
The Crimson now sits on a goals-against average of 0.65, a number that may perhaps pose a challenge to Penn’s offense. Goalie Kat Hess’s four saves also tied a career-best.
“Defending for us is really not a positional thing, it’s a culture,” said Hamblin. “We’ve been really proud of how we’ve executed that plan, but you can’t spend your whole time defending. You’ve got to attack as well, and we’ve done a much better job of finding that balance over the last three games.”
On the offensive end, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi leads the team in goals (4) and points (9), the latter of which ties a career high. The team has had an average of 9.1 shots a game, including a season-high 11 against Syracuse.
On the other hand, Penn is coming off a two-game losing streak, having been outscored 3-8 this season. Sunday’s loss against George Mason also saw the Quakers shut out, 2-0.
But the scoreboard doesn’t reveal it all—Penn has also had high shot totals so far, and it’s perhaps only a matter of time until the shots start to pay off. Quaker senior Erica Higa leads the team in goals (2) and points (4).
“All the Ivy League teams have been playing tough competition in non-conference games in order to better prepare themselves,” Chagares said. “Penn is always a great team regardless of some recent results, and we know it’s going to be a really competitive game.”
One year ago, Harvard also took on the Quakers in opening its Ivy League season. The similarities are few, though; Penn was just as hot as the Crimson last year, and the game was played in Philadelphia.
“I don’t really think it makes sense to compare teams,” said Hamblin. “Every year you have a new team.”
Still, Harvard will hope that history repeats itself. The Crimson has won its Ivy opener, whether home or away, against Penn since 2013.
Speaking of history and repeating, Harvard will also set its sights on the Ivy League title. The Crimson went back-to-back in 2013 and 2014, and the team does not plan on aiming for any less this year. But they’re careful not to get ahead of themselves.
“We’re just trying to make the most of every game,” Chagares said.
“We know that winning Ivy League championships isn’t something you wish for, it’s something you work for,” said Hamblin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This coming Saturday marks the first time since 2011 that Harvard will open the Ivy League slate with a zero in its win column. Six years ago, the Crimson returned home from a first-week loss at Holy Cross in which the Crusaders prevailed, 30-22.
It seems as though this early defeat motivated the 2011 Harvard team, as coach Tim Murphy’s band took care of business in Week 2 at Harvard Stadium, winning 24-7. The hosts picked off Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero twice, and the Crimson defense recovered three of four forced fumbles en route to staunchly halting the Bears’ attack.
Harvard heads into its 2017 matchup versus Brown in nearly an identical situation: a week ago, the Crimson kicked off the fall with another close loss to a non-league opponent on the road. The team is already clamoring to get back onto the field to make up for a disappointing start to the season.
“We feel confident in our game plan going into this game,” senior linebacker Alex White said. “We have a lot to prove, and it was an emotionally charged game, and obviously what happened [to Ben Abercrombie] is on everyone’s mind. But from a defensive standpoint, giving [Rhode Island] 17 points is not acceptable. We can’t expect to win games by giving them 17 points.”
Rhode Island exploited some gaps in Harvard’s secondary, as wide receiver Aaron Parker amassed 103 yards on only three catches, including a long gain of 51 yards for a touchdown. The Crimson’s safeties and defensive backs were notably aggressive throughout the Rhode Island game, and though this strategy can produce interceptions, it also tends to open up holes.
The Bears will introduce junior quarterback Nicholas Duncan, a dual-threat signal caller who has two years’ experience on the sideline and who can create plays with his feet just as well as he can in the air. Look for Brown coach Phil Estes to test Harvard’s secondary, as he has been wont to do in the past.
“They’re going to try to stretch us deep like they did last year a couple of times, and they might catch us with a couple of guys out in coverage and they might get loose, but it’s all about rallying to the ball,” senior safety Tanner Lee said. “Hopefully we’ll keep them contained.”
“We feel pretty good going against dual-threat quarterbacks,” White added. “We have some dual-threat quarterbacks on our team that we practice against every day. Definitely keeping an eye on the quarterback, stopping his scrambles, that’s the game plan.”
Perhaps the most outstanding aspect of the Crimson football team after the season opener is its running game. Junior Charlie Booker III and freshman Aaron Shampklin took the majority of the handoffs in Week 1, and they sliced through the Rams’ front seven all afternoon.
Once Booker breaks through contact, he has the ability to explode for huge gains, as evidenced by his 50 and 57-yard runs in Kingston, R.I. Though the junior battled the injury bug his first two seasons in Crimson, he seems fully healthy and will be an important weapon against the Bears.
Any running attack depends on good protection from the offensive line. Though Harvard’s line appeared shaky at the outset of the season, Murphy is pleased with its progress through camp and the first game, despite numerous penalties that set the Crimson offense back. This unit will be key this Saturday based on how the Brown defense operates.
“They do a lot of blitzing, a lot of twisting with their linemen and backers which is always expected of them, so protection was an emphasis this week,” Booker said.
Of course, one of the notable absences on the field this week will be cornerback Ben Abercrombie. The freshman is recovering from neck surgery after sustaining a cervical injury during the Rhode Island game. The team has rallied around Abercrombie over the past week, giving this upcoming game added significance.
“We have a lot more to play for,” Lee said. “This week the guys have really come together as a team more than we had in the past. It’s kind of hard to think about really, but we’re going out there and playing for Ben. His nickname is Badger so our motto is ‘Fight like a badger.’”
One would have to go all the way back to 2000 to find a season in which Harvard lost its home opener. While history is bound to repeat itself sometime, the Crimson is favored as it heads into its Saturday showdown with the Bears, though Murphy was quick not to dismiss Brown’s competitiveness.
“They don’t necessarily have a long-term rival, so we’ve become that de facto team for them,” Murphy said. “Our kids sort of understand we get everybody’s best shot, and we certainly get Brown’s best shot every year.”
