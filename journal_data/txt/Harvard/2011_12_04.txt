After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some say that they would do anything for love, but how many people would use a man-eating plant to win over the girl of their dreams? Through soaring musical numbers and a fantastic set design The Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “Little Shop of Horrors”, directed by Charlotte H. Alter ’12 and running from November 29 to December 3 on the Loeb Mainstage, explores this question. “Horrors” is a darkly comic musical with a fiery and feisty cast that also examines serious issues such as abuse, jealousy, and redemption.
“Little Shop of Horrors” revolves around Seymour Krelborn (Matthew J. DaSilva ’12) a lonely and pathetic orphan, who wastes away as a virtual slave in the Skid Row Flower Shop, run by the incorrigible Mrs. Mushnik (Emily B. Hyman ’13). To add to his troubles, he is in love with fellow shop worker Audrey (Yasmeen E. Audi ’15). Audrey, oblivious to Seymour’s affections, is in a self-destructive relationship with the lunatic dentist Orin (Steven D. Bombino ’12). After a solar eclipse, Seymour discovers a horticultural wonder in the shop that fails to thrive until it gets a taste of his blood. As the plant grows, its appetites grow larger and larger, and soon it is devouring whole people.
The design of Skid Row, created by set designer Isabel Strauss ’13, looks like some of the dodgier areas of New York City, and provides an excellent setting for the drama. Its depiction of the dirty streets and run-down flower shop shows a significant attention to detail. The washed-out look of the store contrasts nicely with Audrey II—as Seymour lovingly named the plant—who is almost bursting with color.  One of the highlights of the show is the plant itself, which literally grows with every scene change. As the play progresses, Audrey II becomes more intricate and complex until it literally takes over the whole stage.
The cast is both dynamic and engaging, and complements the over-the-top set with some well thought out and nuanced performances. DaSilva uses his solo numbers very effectively to show his character’s development over the course of the play. For example, as he struggles to understand the power of the alien plant, his powerful voice on his solo “Grow for Me” allows him to transcend his nerdy persona and explore Seymour’s newfound confidence. Hyman plays the role of Mushnik very convincingly, but her lack of emotional growth over the course of the play leaves the character feeling stilted. Audi steals the show as Audrey; she is able to maintain her character’s timid persona even while belting out some of the show’s biggest songs. Whenever she walks, for instance, she shuffles her feet; details like this come together to create a well-rounded character. Bombino’s grandiosity stands in stark contrast to his love interest’s timid nature. One of the standout moments in the show is his final number in act one, in which he sings that being a dentist is the perfect job for someone who had sadistic tendencies as a child. His larger-than-life character is a whimsical study in irony. He combines camp acting with a delightfully silly vocal style, which highlights the absurdity of his words.
Alter’s direction is both nuanced and effective. She manages to derive humor from the set’s run-down aesthetic by having an actor pop up out of one of the trashcans, much like Oscar the Grouch, during the opening number. She also handles the more technically difficult scenes with wonderful imagination. It’s hard to have a character be eaten gracefully by a giant plant, but Alter blocks scenes that are both visually interesting and hilarious.
The play does, however, suffer from some poorly handled sound issues. For the first several minutes of the show the orchestra overpowers the opening monologue, rendering it almost incomprehensible. Likewise, towards the end of the play appears a gun that is mysteriously silent when fired; it renders what should have been a dramatic scene almost meaningless. Still, these moments are minor distractions from an otherwise triumphant performance.
“Little Shop of Horrors” is a dark comedy that oscillates between humor and horror. Amazing set pieces combine with inspired direction and fantastic singing to create a one-of-a-kind musical experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team appears destined for the Associated Press Top 25 for the first time in program history.
With the Crimson’s 80-70 victory over Seattle University Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard (8-0) likely secured itself a spot in the national rankings, which will be released Monday afternoon.
“Obviously it would be a neat thing if it happened for us,” said Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, who earned his 250th career head coaching victory with Sunday’s win. “I know our players would be very excited, and I would be very, very proud of them if that were to take place. If not, the sun would come up, and we’ll have somebody to play and get ready for the next one.”
On Sunday, Harvard was led by a breakout performance from freshman forward Jonah Travis, who notched 19 points, 10 rebounds, three assists, and two steals, all career-highs. The rookie worked in an efficient manner, shooting 6-of-8 from the field in 19 minutes off the bench.
“Jonah is a monster—one of the hardest-working players I’ve ever seen,” said junior point guard Brandyn Curry. “[He’s] relentless on the boards—always attacking. He’s just a beast. He gave us a lift that we definitely needed against this team.”
Travis wasn’t the only reserve to step up for the Crimson. Rookie Steve Moundou-Missi added a career-high eight points and six rebounds in 27 minutes playing in place of junior Kyle Casey, who struggled with foul trouble.
Sharpshooting sophomore Laurent Rivard finished second on the team in scoring, posting 14 points on 3-of-8 shooting in 23 minutes off the bench.
“We are gaining a great deal of confidence in our young players and our bench in particular,” said Amaker, whose bench outscored Seattle’s, 46-22. “I think we have good balance on our team.”
The Crimson, which led by 12 at the half, extended its lead to as many as 17 with 14:41 to go after sophomore Rivard took a handoff from Travis at the top of the key and buried a three-pointer. But the Redhawks (2-4) managed to fight their way back into the game, as Seattle’s Clarence Trent (14 points) went on a personal 7-0 run to bring the visitors back within single digits, 58-49, with 11:26 to go.
“They just came out really hard, and I don’t think we were as prepared as we should have been for how fast and how hard they were going to go at us,” said Curry of Seattle, which posted more points against the Crimson than any of its previous opponents.
Led by Curry, Harvard answered. The junior scored six points in less than three minutes of play to lead the Crimson on an 8-2 run. Coming out of a timeout, Curry capped off the run by nailing a three-pointer from the right wing off a skip pass from co-captain Oliver McNally, putting Harvard ahead by 15, 66-51, with 8:01 to play.
“On that play, after I cut through, if they over-help on [co-captain Keith Wright], then the look is to skip it over to me,” Curry explained. “Oliver hit me with a good pass, and I just stepped up and made it.”
Seattle was unable to recover from the deficit, and Harvard’s lead did not dip into single digits the rest of the way.
While the Crimson eventually took control of the contest, it took time for Harvard to gain separation from the visiting Redhawks. After the Crimson took its first double-digit lead of the game off a jumper from junior Christian Webster with 7:50 to play in the first, Seattle made it a two-possession game after Prince Obasi knocked down back-to-back three-pointers.
Travis answered on the ensuing Crimson possession, pulling down an offensive rebound off a Webster miss, and then exploding to the basket. Travis finished an and-1 layup, extending Harvard’s lead to eight. The Crimson’s lead never fell below seven the rest of the way.
The victory extended the Crimson’s winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion to 19 games, marking the ninth-longest current home winning streak in the nation.
Now that the Crimson is likely to find its way into Top 25, preserving that home winning streak might be more difficult.
“All that [being ranked] means is that the target just got a lot bigger on us,” Curry said. “Being in the Top 25, people are going to really, really come after us, so we’ve got to be prepared. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”

Should actor, writer, and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star Larry David soon add a Nobel Prize for efforts fostering Middle East peace to his cache of Emmy awards and nominations? Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz' answer might surprise you. In a recent interview with "The Columbia Current," the Harvard Law School professor revealed that he recently sent a copy of his favorite episode of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in the hope that it might serve to facilitate Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
In Dershowitz' favorite episode, "Palestinian Chicken," David and friends start eating at Al-Abbas, a Palestinian restaurant that apparently serves undeniably delicious chicken. The chicken is so good that David declares the Palestinians should send it over to Israel—if they did, he says, the Israelis, "would take down all the settlements in the morning." When the restaurant announces plans to open a new venue next door to a Jewish deli, however, David finds himself torn between his Jewish friends, who demand he protest the opening with them, and a beautiful Palestinian woman from the restaurant he has begun seeing.
Dershowitz said that when he sent the episode to Netanyahu, he suggested that the prime minister and President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas watch the show together. "Maybe if they both get a good laugh, they can begin a negotiating process," he said.
While we await a day during which Netanyahu and Abbas bond over Larry David, Dershowitz remains hopeful. "I know that Netanyahu has received the DVD, and he was looking forward to watching it."

Maybe it's not such a good idea to review the work of a self-proclaimed "vendetta person."
 
Last April, asked by The Guardian whether he ever forgives a slight, Harvard history professor Niall Ferguson replied, "Never. I'm completely unforgiving."
 
After publishing a damaging review of Ferguson's latest book, "Civilization: The West and the Rest," it looks like the London Review of Books is about to find out just how truthfully Ferguson spoke. In a letter to the editor, Ferguson responded to the review by accusing the writer, columnist Pankaj Mishra, of portraying him as a racist. He demanded an apology for this "libelous and dishonest article." A back-and-forth row ensued.
 
Reached for comment, Ferguson maintains that his latest work "explicitly disavows all racial explanations for Western economic and political predominance." In his assessment, the whole point of the book is to demonstrate how good institutions can work "regardless of the country where they are adopted, regardless of culture tradition, regardless of skin color."
 
Ferguson said he intends to keep up his complaints in the press until the reviewer relents.
 
"The really important point to get here is that I have received many critical reviews in my time, and I accept criticism where it is warranted in my work. But this was not a legitimate critique of my book; it was primarily a character assassination," Ferguson said.
 
It now looks like this very public spat may move from the pages of the London Review of Books into court. "I can't imagine why the London Review of Books wanted to stand by this man. But, clearly, I have to reserve the right to take legal advice if they are not going to apologize," Ferguson said.
 
In Ferguson's opinion, the review stands to hurt the publication commercially too: "Any serious person will conclude that it is not worth reading the London Review of Books anymore because they don't employ serious reviewers," he said. "They employ hacks, liars, defamers—that's really what this boils down to."
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 7, 2011.
An earlier version of the Dec. 4 post "Niall Ferguson in Literary Spat with London Review of Books" misquoted Niall Ferguson. In fact, Ferguson referred to "culture tradition" in paragraph four of the article.
