After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Sunday, My Bloody Valentine released their first album since November 4, 1991, two days before the KGB officially became defunct. The release of "mbv" brought them back to immediate relevance, to the delight of their fans. MBV isn't the only band returning to prominence this year, though—here are five other artists coming out of hibernation in 2013.
Justin Timberlake—"The 20/20 Experience"
Remember when JT was a musician? It seems as though since the release of "FutureSex / LoveSounds" in 2006, nobody has really been sure what to call the renaissance man—Musician? Actor? Sean Parker? The recent single "Suit & Tie" was a popular success, which bodes well for the album. But the only thing that Timberlake seems to provide with regular certainty is his unfortunate inability to name his tours. "Justified & Stripped Tour" and "FutureSex/LoveShow" have been the only members of the "Terribly Titled Timberlake Tours" list for far too long. We're ready for "The 20/20 Sexperience."
David Bowie—"The Next Day"
The one thing we remember David Bowie doing since his 2001 cameo in "Zoolander" is voicing Lord Royal Highness in the Spongebob Squarepants made-for-TV movie "Atlantis SquarePantis." This year, though, Bowie is out to prove that he can emerge from a long-kept silence to reassume his iconic role as a controversial, androgynous rock star.
The Avalanches—TBA
The Avalanches released "Since I Left You" in 2000 to critical acclaim and have been silent since. The 18-track debut release of weirdly foreign electronic pop left critics and fans desperate for more. Their second album was informally announced in 2005, but it's taken eight years for it to come to fruition. 13 years of silence can change a lot of things—The Avalanches announced via their website that their second album is "so fuckin' party you will die."
The Knife—"Shaking the Habitual"
The Knife haven't exactly been quiet since "Silent Shout" in 2006. Singer Karin Dreijer Andersson released an eponymous solo album under the name "Fever Ray" in 2009, and she and Olof Dreijer wrote an opera based on Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" in 2010. Nonetheless, it's exciting to see The Knife come back together to announce the release of their long-awaited follow-up album. A standout duo birthed from the rich Swedish electronica scene, Karin and Olof often refuse to attend even their own award ceremonies—and when they do appear in public, they frequently wear carnival masks and creepy makeup.
Deltron 3030—"Event II"
Deltron 3030 is a supergroup made up of producer Dan the Automator, rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, and DJ Kid Koala. Their eponymous debut, an alternative hip-hopera that detailed Deltron Zero's fight against corporations in the year 3030, was released in 2000 to critical praise. Originally planned for 2007, the release of "Event II" has been pushed back countless times—but it seems as though Deltron 3030 is finally ready to release the second installment of their saga. Del has warned fans not to expect an eventual trilogy, so this may be the last we hear of Deltron Zero.

Twenty-two years is a long time for anyone to stay dormant. Even before My Bloody Valentine announced “m b v,”—their first album since 1991’s “Loveless,”—2013 seemed to be destined to be the year of the comeback for artists who have long been out of the limelight. But David Bowie has released six albums in the past 22 years. It’s only been seven years since Justin Timberlake’s “FutureSex/LoveSounds.” Entire careers of other shoegazing artists, such as Lush, would have been born and dissolved in the span of 22 years—twice.
My Bloody Valentine’s first album in two decades is and probably will remain the biggest drop of 2013, an already promising year in which Skrillex was featured on an A$AP Rocky track. Perhaps the quietest My Bloody Valentine album yet, “m b v” lacks the teeth of “Isn’t Anything” and fails to match the stunning innovation of “Loveless.” But thanks to the band’s newfound level of intimacy and its inspired style, “m b v” is a universally accessible album that showcases the band’s expertise, even after an extended hiatus.
 
The opening track, “She Found Now,” defines the sound palette for the rest of the album. As the guitars buzz and frontman Kevin Shields croons soft, indecipherable sounds, My Bloody Valentine immediately establish “m b v” as more intimate than “Loveless.” Instead of making the album seem unadventurous, however, this closeness is welcoming. The familiar blanket of sound knit by “She Found Now” instantly brings with it memories of the murky guitars on “Loveless,” albeit in a more understated manner.
 
Part of the intimacy of “mbv” comes from the meticulously recorded drum track that was cut first by Jimi Shields, removed, and then redone by their original drummer, Colm Ó Cíosóig. With the exception of the tracks “In Another Way” and “Nothing Is”—which feature brazen drum tracks that share center stage with the usually uncontested sound of guitars—“m b v” explores a wide array of unobtrusive drum tracks, most parts sinking into the blanket of sound rather than providing their own distinct timbres. Even the more upbeat “Who Sees You” uses Cíosóig’s track in a textural way, the repetitive beat eventually becoming the wheels on which the song churns forth. 
 
The finest example of this understated sound comes in the minimalistic and daring “Is This and Yes,” a meditative amalgam of ringing synthesizers and seemingly wordless vocals. The track sounds almost like a tone poem in that the interest lies in the transition between one tonal quality to the next rather than in the details of any particular instrumental or vocal tracks. As the fourth track on the album, “Is This and Yes” comes a little too soon to feel like a truly introspective oasis within the framework of “m b v,” but it still makes its point: My Bloody Valentine are no longer defining shoegazing—they’re exploring it. 
 
Although “m b v” is deeply personal, it also stands as a much bigger album than the sum of its parts, thanks to its experimental nature and its relationship to My Bloody Valentine’s larger discography. It has all the makings of what would have been a classic album had it been released in the 1990s, when much of its development occurred. But today, it is evident that in My Bloody Valentine’s two silent decades, the album has only aged well.
 
My Bloody Valentine’s “m b v” rounds out their trio of full-length LPs perfectly. “Isn’t Anything” arrived in 1988 with a sound that was explored and tested through “Loveless.” But it is only on “m b v” that My Bloody Valentine really master the shoegazing sound. On this album, Shields proves that he is comfortable enough to take risks with unconventional song structure and compositional choices.  A prime example of this experimentation is the track “Nothing Is,” which features Shields and Cíosóig jamming on a single chord, creating a broken-record effect that tempts listeners to check their discs for imperfections. “Nothing Is”—along with “In Another Way”— rounds out “m b v” with confidence as they carve a new facet of noisy, driving energy into the classically mellow genre of shoegazing. 
 
This daringness contributes a sense of honesty to My Bloody Valentine’s latest album—shoegazing isn’t new anymore, and embracing this revelation seems to have untangled all the reservations in My Bloody Valentine’s sound. “m b v” is the frank work of a master who understands his genre better than anyone. Shoegazing still isn’t a genre for perfection, but by acknowledging this, “m b v” comes closer than ever before.
 
This new album doesn’t herald a heroic return of classic My Bloody Valentine, nor does it feel like a simple regurgitation of their previous material. Rather, “m b v” provides an immersion into Kevin Shields’s 22 years of silence. The quiet, closed-doors approach of the album makes it seem as though Shields is pointing a satellite dish at these lost decades, picking up the faint echoes and remnants of noise left by “Loveless” and rearranging them in both familiar and innovative patterns. The result is equally personal and remarkable—an album that finally cements My Bloody Valentine’s lasting legacy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is the start of a new semester, which means shopping week frustration, frantic book purchasing, and, for a growing proportion of students on campus, rushing one of several social organizations that fall under the umbrella of Greek life on campus. This past week marked the beginning of sorority recruitment, a process whose spiking interest has forced the school’s Pan-Hellenic Council to add another group, women’s fraternity Alpha Phi. While we have previously bemoaned the increasing prevalence of Greek life on campus, we now recognize that students who look to the sororities or fraternities for vibrant social life are responding rationally to the College’s stringent drinking policies. Greek organizations are an ultimately positive force for the Harvard community.
Our earlier critique of the Greek system noted its genesis as an outgrowth of Harvard’s abject failure to create a satisfactory social scene for those interested in fraternizing with classmates outside of section. We also lamented the gender division present in Greek life, which we still find regrettable. However, the positives of Greek life, such as added social vibrancy and a relatively inclusive rush process, appear to outweigh the negatives of gender exclusivity. And while we still sympathize with the College’s interminable crusade to promote campus community, it is unfair to expect current students to sit by the inoperative fireplaces in their dormitories and wait patiently as the Office of Student Life brainstorms how to improve social life. Harvard has thus far been stunningly bad in making progress on this issue. At the moment, the school’s paternalistic alcohol policies make students feel unwelcome even in their own environs, a situation that inevitably creates the natural curiosity about friendships possibly attainable outside the confines of in loco parentis.
Harvard creates a particularly demanding environment, both academically and socially, and the average student should have the inalienable right to, as Supreme Court Justice and Harvard Law graduate Anthony M. Kennedy ’61 put it, “define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” In writing the decision for Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he went on, “People have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society.” The College should let students organize the relationships they please by recognizing Greek organizations, especially considering the overbearing policies the College imposes upon its residents.
Most graduates of Harvard College emerge with impressive résumés and extensive LinkedIn profiles. Yet while Harvardians may enter the world with thick Rolodexes full of future contacts, we believe the administration’s regime begets a fundamental deficiency in the development of a meaningful life on campus outside of academia. It is up to individual students to define their own concept of existence here, a daunting task for a sizeable portion of the population. Some students are able to find fulfillment in a capella groups or cultural clubs, while others seek it within their House Committees or sports teams. We see no reason that Greek organizations should be maligned or stigmatized for filling a similar role on campus.

Originally a 2009 Teach For America Mississippi Delta Corps Member, I am now a fourth-year teacher of low-income and minority students at a public charter high school in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. I would not be a teacher today without the support of TFA, and the majority of my incredible colleagues are Teach For America alumni. My principal—the most effective school leader I have ever witnessed as a teacher or a student—is a TFA alumnus.
But February 15 marks the final deadline to apply to be a 2013 TFA Corps Member, and you should not click “submit.”
Unfortunately, many TFA alumni (including myself) allow sentimentality to blind us to the harsh practicalities of TFA and its place in the education reform movement. The truth is, TFA teachers within their two-year corps commitment window do not, by and large, have tangible positive impacts on their classrooms. The natural extension is that if you join TFA, you will most likely have a neutral or negative impact on the academic gains of the students that you teach.
TFA paints a rosy picture for its prospective applicants when it glows that TFA corps members enable “students in high-need communities [to] make the academic progress that expands their opportunities.” But this statement isn’t bolstered by fact. TFA is not a traditional teacher-education program. In lieu of obtaining extensive preparation in multi-year undergraduate teacher credentialing programs, TFA corps members complete a five-week training program called “institute” in the summer immediately before they begin teaching. One study on the subject has shown that when compared a relatable cohort, teachers in the same schools who are untraditionally prepared and less likely to be certified, novice TFA teachers perform equivalently—but not superior—to those colleagues.
This seems disappointing but not terrible. You might not be the next Jaime Escalante (Stand and Deliver, anyone?), but surely you’re not going to de-learn your students as a first-year corps member, right?
Not so fast. Compare the performance of Teach For America corps members to another cohort: credentialed, non-TFA corps members. The same study indicates that novice TFA teachers actually perform significantly less well in reading and math than credentialed beginning teachers at the same schools. Keep in mind that to “perform significantly less well” as a teacher is quite literally to have a group of 10, 100, or even 200 students learn less than they would had you not been their teacher.
A professed mission of Teach For America when it was founded was to “provide an excellent education for kids in low-income communities,” especially in classrooms staffed by permanent or non-permanent substitutes and “emergency hires.” (My own students’ Algebra I teacher died in the fall before I came, and the students did not see a licensed or credentialed teacher for the rest of the year. Every child was passed on to geometry, yet 91 percent of them failed a low-rigor state Algebra I assessment.) In situations like that, a TFA teacher can be an injection of energy into a “failing” school. In those schools, TFA teachers are no more inadequate than their alternative, and the chance that these corps members might stay past two years and develop into strong teachers is small but worth taking. Unfortunately, these scenarios are becoming less and less frequent.
According to the study, TFA has been placing teachers outside of those roles that cannot be filled by certified or experienced candidates, in positions that could be filled (or in some cases, were previously filled until rounds of layoffs) by effective, veteran teachers. Although an initial skim of data released by the U.S. Department of Education reveals a large number of regions suffering from teacher shortages, a closer look reveals that TFA placements are “largely outside” of those highest-need areas. Therefore, the fact that TFA teachers are equally or more effective than their unqualified colleagues becomes irrelevant as we realize that the teachers who were once the inadequate alternative are, in fact, no longer the alternative at all.
There is some limited statistical evidence that TFA can be at least marginally impactful. But so few TFA teachers stay in the classroom beyond three years (more than 50 percent leave after two years and more than 80 percent leave after three), that the potential positive impact of TFA is rarely felt by the people who matter most—the students. In short, TFA may be pumping alumni who “understand” the achievement gap firsthand into various professions and fields outside of direct instruction, but it is doing so at the academic expense of the highest-risk kids who have the greatest need for effective teachers
If you feel inspired to teach, I beg you: teach! There are young people who need “lifers” committed to powering through the inevitable first three years of being terrible at teaching sinusoidal curves to hormonal 17 year-olds. I encourage you to pursue an alternative route to licensure and placement: one that encourages and actively supports longevity in the classroom and does not facilitate teacher turnover by encouraging its alumni to move into policy or other professions. If you feel compelled to Teach For America instead of teaching for America, please preference a region that has demonstrated a high need for novice teachers due to verifiable teacher shortages. And then stay in the classroom. For a long time. Feel at home teaching, and feel even more at home learning how to get better. Sit. Stay a while. Then stand and deliver.
Emma M. Lind '09, an editorial chair emeritus, is a public charter high school teacher in Brooklyn, New York.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
America’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were predicated upon the notion that a safe haven for terrorists anywhere threatens America’s national interests. This idea made sense when a mostly Saudi group of terrorists managed to murder nearly 3,000 Americans in the September 11, 2001 attacks.  The world has grown only more interconnected since.  The U.S. was largely successful in driving Islamic militants out of much of the Middle East, a result of a decade of ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a continued use of unmanned drones as far away as Yemen.
Many of the Islamic militants driven from the Middle East moved into Africa, particularly Mali, and managed to take over an area larger than all of mainland France.  Allowing any safe haven for terrorists, President George W. Bush would have argued, goes against our national interest, and, as such, we have a right to use military force to stop them.  France’s President François G. G. N. Hollande seems to have used this rationale when he decided to send the French military into Mali to combat the militants there.
Bear in mind that the French president that decided to involve the military was not Nicolas Sarkozy, the right-wing leader who further entangled France in Afghanistan, Libya, and the Ivory Coast.  No, the President who engaged militarily in Mali is Hollande, the Socialist politician who was widely perceived to be softer than flan and more indecisive than Hamlet. One could conceivably claim that Hollande needed to play the part of a warrior to toughen his image at home, but I have a difficult time believing that a Socialist leader who would cut government spending by €12.5 billion in the interest of fiscal health would engage in a costly military conflict without good cause.
France’s decision to invade Mali in many ways vindicates the Bush Doctrine.  France has sent its military into sovereign territory in order to protect itself from perceived threats, emulating one of the hallmarks of our last administration’s foreign policy.  The United States, Bush maintained, had the right to use force against countries harboring terrorist groups.  At the time, France was one of the most public critics of America’s aggressive foreign policy stance.  In a largely unnoticed role-reversal, America has become the tepid partner trying to avoid the costs of war.
Some key differences do persist between the wars of Bush and Hollande.  France is doing everything in its power to leave Mali as soon as possible and turn over military control to African forces.  Furthermore, France has limited its actual combat as much as possible rather than take over all of Mali in one fell swoop.  These welcome policies do mark a shift from the more troop-heavy, longer-term wars of the Bush Administration.  However, the inescapable fact remains that France committed ground troops in order to fight terrorists on another continent in the name of national interest.
President Barack Obama is not an adherent to Bush’s foreign policy.  So why is Hollande?  Perhaps the war in Mali was orchestrated as a political move of sorts, in which the primary motive has more to do with perception than the reality on the ground in northern Africa.  More likely, though, is the probability that Hollande simply determined that allowing Islamic militants to control much of Mali posed a national security threat to France.  The Bush Doctrine, it seems, is alive and well—in France.
The past four years have seen an eclectic mix of American foreign policy maneuvers.  While Obama has embraced and drastically expanded the use of unmanned drones to target individuals, he has assiduously avoided committing troops to any conflict.  He eagerly embraced democratic change in his speeches as the Arab Spring swept the Middle East, but refrained from more actively supporting democratic agents, such as those in Syria.  With the exception of Obama’s widely lauded commitment to keeping our troops out of combat, no unified doctrine seems to be guiding his decisions, for better or for worse.
Obama has not quite rejected Bush’s foreign policy, but he certainly hasn’t embraced it, either. François Hollande, on the other hand, has caught critics flat-footed in his seeming emulation of George W. Bush’s foreign strategies.  A year ago, few would have guessed that Bush’s legacy would be carried on by a socialist French administration.  But Hollande has in large part justified Bush’s foreign policy with his own intervention in Mali. We’ll call it the Hollande Doctrine, because Hollande is probably not the biggest fan of Bush.

Since its release on January 15, the book Total Frat Move by W.R. Bolen has rocketed into the New York Times Best Seller list. Hailed as the next Animal House, TFM glorifies everything that makes Greek life one of the most stereotyped parts of American college culture. According to the jacket cover, TFM is a “national update on college fraternities” where “the amount of alcohol that is being consumed, promiscuous sex that is being enjoyed, and intense drug-induced raging that is taking place on campuses across the country has quietly reached ridiculous new heights.” While the accuracy of W.R. Bolen’s representation of fraternity life at American universities is certainly debatable, the book’s rapid ascent through the bestseller charts testifies that the public continues to be fascinated by the prevalent, yet mysterious culture that exists on over 800 U.S. and Canadian campuses including Harvard’s.
Though the final clubs at Harvard have long dominated fraternities because of their histories and more prominent real estate, Greek life is becoming increasingly visible at Harvard in the form of sororities. In 2011, recruitment numbers for Harvard’s sororities reached a peak of 268 women. While that number dropped slightly last year to 250 women, the consistently large numbers of potential new members has caused Harvard’s Pan-Hellenic Council to add an additional sorority to campus. This year Alpha Phi will join Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma in recruiting new members. Even with this growth, Harvard remains staunch in its refusal to recognize Greek life on campus.
Despite the lack of recognition, on February 2 potential new members flocked to the first night of recruitment for many reasons. Some like freshman Julia Kee were looking to “find a group of like-minded people.” Others were seeking a family away from home, philanthropic opportunities, or a broader social scene. No matter what their reasons were, that night they entered into a world that may not breed success, but from which successful individuals certainly spring. According to George Washington University’s “Greek Speak” website, though only 3 percent of Americans were once involved with Greek life, 76 percent of the United States Congress were once involved. All but two U.S. Presidents and Vice-Presidents since 1825 have been fraternity members. On a more feminine note, the first female senator and the first female astronaut were sorority members, and they are joined in Greek life by 71 percent of the “Who’s Who in America.” Harvard women have decided that the benefits of Greek life, in addition to its correlation with future success, outweigh Harvard’s lack of support.
Of Harvard College’s approximately 6,700 students, 3,350 are female. Delta Gamma has 135 members; Kappa Kappa Gamma has 125; and Kappa Alpha Theta has 108. Two hundred and fifty women went through recruitment again this year, which means that 618 Harvard women were involved or were interested in becoming involved with Greek life on campus. That is almost a fifth of Harvard women.
Eighteen percent is a number that rivals some of the largest student organizations on campus. At 1,400 volunteers, the entire PBHA program makes up 21 percent of campus. In 2010, Harvard reported having 1142 athletes playing 42 varsity sports, which is about 17 percent of the student body. These numbers demonstrate clearly that Greek life is a prominent and, arguably, a dominant part of women’s’ lives on campus. By not recognizing Greek life, Harvard ignores a powerful segment of the student population.
I can understand Harvard’s qualms about Greek life. I would imagine that college administrators have watched Animal House, and the recent success of Total Frat Move certainly confirms the belief that Greek life is a breeding ground for immoral and illegal behavior. Perhaps Harvard does not wish to associate itself with such negative stereotypes—despite the many benefits of Greek life, such as scholarship, service, networking and philanthropy, which have been called “some of the most rewarding parts of Greek life” by sophomore and Kappa Kappa Gamma council member Anna Menzel.
Recently, Harvard has chosen to associate itself with both a BDSM sex club and a group that promotes premarital abstinence and a traditional view of marriage, the Harvard College Abscombe Society. In recognizing socially controversial and contradictory groups, College administrators have clearly shown that though they may not agree with the values or actions of particular student groups, they still believe that these groups should have the right to exist on campus. Additionally, though allegedly Greek culture promotes underage drinking and other illegal activities, most students could easily name many Harvard recognized student groups that also engage in such behaviors. With this in mind, and in the light of recruitment season, Harvard needs to lay down its copy of Total Frat Move and reexamine its stance on Greek life and social organization recognition.

For more than 40 years, Oona’s Experienced Clothing has cultivated a reputation as an old-fashioned vintage clothing seller tucked away on Mass. Ave. in Harvard Square. But since it came under new ownership two years ago, the store has begun to move in a new, more modern direction.
Young business owner Eleanor “Ellie” Mueller, who took over the store in August 2010, has already made changes to the interior of Oona’s and is looking to introduce new modern merchandise and expand the store’s online presence in the coming weeks.
This month, Mueller is launching an online store on Oona’s existing website, where she will sell current and designer brands in addition to the store’s vintage stock.
She plans to also begin selling current and designer brands inside the store by mid-March.
“When I started thinking about someone else taking over, I thought of its potential and all of the things someone could do to hold on to what was great about it, but reinvent it a little bit,” Mueller said.
To celebrate the launch, Mueller is hosting a fashion show, which will be open to the public, on Sunday, Feb. 17, at UpStairs on the Square. The runway will hearken back to the store’s vintage roots by featuring approximately 20 models wearing some of the store’s most unique and high fashion pieces.
“I think there will be a pretty good mix of different eras on our runway, but they all have that unusual and refreshing quality to them,” she said.
To go along with her product changes, Mueller has also looked to transform the physical appearance of her store. She has undertaken several store renovations, such as redecorating the shop with rugs and furniture to give customers the sense that they had entered someone’s home.
“Most people react to the space a lot now,” she added.
Mueller said she believes the store’s new direction will create opportunities for creative and business success.
“I’m always just looking for interesting designs, and I think by not taking modern clothing, we’re really cutting ourselves off from offering all these amazing pieces to people,” Mueller said.
Still, Mueller said she sees value in her store’s traditional vintage merchandise. Mueller said that while modern fashion is dominated by a specific trend each season, vintage clothing offers people a broader variety of styles and allows them to decide for themselves what to wear.
“For me, [vintage] is not about recreating a different time period, but more just valuing what they did well,” she said.

The Harvard Divinity School announced a $10 million gift from James R. Swartz ’64 and former Divinity School artist-in-residence Susan Shallcross Swartz last Wednesday. The donation—one of the largest in the school’s history—will fund the creation of the Susan Shallcross Swartz Endowment for Christian Studies, supporting new professorships, fellowships, and programming at the Divinity School.
“My hope is that the endowment will inspire scholarship and reinvigorate debate, service, and teaching for generations to come,” Susan Swartz said in a press release.
The gift comes as Harvard plans to embark on a University-wide capital campaign as soon as late 2013.
Swartz said she hopes the endowment will “allow [Divinity School] Dean [David N.] Hempton to take the School into the future, and to improve the currency of the leadership that HDS exercises.”
The donation is the first notable gift received by the school since Hempton became its dean in 2012.
“The Swartz Endowment will expand our ability to assemble the leading scholars and thinkers in the field—and to draw the talented students that they attract. We are deeply grateful to Susan and Jim for their generosity, and for their continued faith in our mission,” Hempton said in the press release.
Susan Swartz served as the Divinity School’s first artist-in-residence in 2005 and has also served on the school’s Dean’s Council. She now works as a professional American landscape painter, working from studios based in Massachusetts and Utah.
According to her website, Swartz is "inspired by the natural world and the intersection of spirituality and art” in her paintings.
Swartz, who served as artist-in-residence at the Divinity School under former dean William A. Graham’s tenure, said in the statement that she was impressed by Graham’s commitment during his leadership to “keeping the oldest divinity school in the country a vibrant place of scholarship and reflection” and hopes that the $10 million donation will help keep this energy alive and flourishing.
James Swartz is active in venture capital, serving as a founding partner of Accel Partners—a global venture and growth equity firm that funds companies from their inception and throughout their growth.
The last major donation to the Divinity School prior to Susan and James Swartz’s donation happened in Oct. 2011, when the Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation gave $2.7 million to support the founding of The Buddhist Ministry Initiative­—a program to foster the training of Buddhist ministers at the Divinity School.
The school has a history of attracting substantial donations, dating back to January 1954 when John D. Rockefeller Jr. gave $1 million towards the Divinity School’s endowment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Office for Sustainability has placed clear, blue, e-waste collection tubes in over 50 locations across campus. The new program strives to increase the degree to which Harvard students recycle smaller, handheld e-waste from laptops, batteries, chargers, and phones that is harder to keep track of than the larger waste already collected by building managers and other personnel.
Until now, students, faculty, and other members of the Harvard community have had to submit their smaller e-waste to building managers for proper disposal. The new collection program seeks to imitate e-waste recycling efforts that already exist at the Harvard Divinity School that seek to eliminate the middle man in the recycling process by having easily accessible collection receptacles that quickly fill up with laptop batteries, old phones, and other hazardous waste.
“The small, white buckets in building manager’s offices weren’t really conspicuous or noticeable, but we’re hoping that the blue tubes are much more visible and accessible,” said Akshay M. Sharma ’14, freshman yard captain for the Resource Efficiency Program, an undergraduate program under the Office for Sustainability.
Once filled, the blue tubes are sent to a sorting facility in Allston where local students from Minuteman Regional High School organize the waste. The students are part of the Career Directions Program of the LABBB Education Collaborative, an initiative that seeks to provide career development skills to students with learning disabilities and developmental delays. In addition to e-waste sorting, the students also help the Office of Sustainability with the organization of books, clothes, and other donated goods, as well as the repair and reassembling of computers.
The toxicity of the heavy metals in batteries such as cadmium, mercury, and lead make it illegal to dispose of them in regular trash receptacles.
“If you don’t care about yourself, worry about the birds, bees, and people that are harmed because of contamination in landfills,” said Robert M. Gogan, Harvard’s associate manager for recycling services.
Gogan cited the precious metal content of these goods, and the potential to reuse them, as another reason for the program’s importance. Coltan, a material the mining of which is said to fuel the Ituri conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is used to make the tantalum capacitors used in many of the electronic devices collected under the new program.
“We need to start collecting the phones because it’s going to be a lot cheaper and better for the people of central Africa if we get Coltan for the new generation of cell phones from the last,” said Gogan.
According to Gogan, the e-waste recycling movement at Harvard is set to continue this month with E-cycleMania, a national competition in which Harvard will try to collect more e-waste than other universities. This year, the goal is to collect 500 pounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two feet of snow coated Harvard’s campus this weekend as winter storm “Nemo” became Boston’s fifth-largest snowstorm on record, with 24.9 inches of snow measured in the city according to official reports.
All non-residential University facilities including Harvard’s libraries closed at noon on Friday in compliance with a blizzard warning issued by the National Weather Service. The University shut down all shuttle operations at 3:30 p.m. after Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 declared a state of emergency and banned all non-emergency vehicles from state roads.
Harvard Campus Services—which is responsible for facilities upkeep and snow removal—spent Thursday engaged in various activities preparing for the storm, including inspection of energies and utilities, inventory of supplies, and staffing accommodations. According to Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin, employees continued to work throughout the weekend to clear roads and walkways across campus, even during the height of the storm.
The statewide road ban, combined with the shutdown of the MBTA Friday afternoon, created a tremendous obstacle for Harvard University Dining Services as staff workers were left stranded on campus and other employees had no way to travel to Harvard and offer relief. As a result many workers who started their days at 6 a.m. on Friday did not leave until Saturday night.
According to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin, staff members stayed overnight in hotel rooms and open House dorms to ensure continued service in the dining halls. HUDS reduced its menu offerings and switched to disposable dishware in an effort to cope with the staff shortage.
In many Houses, students and other House residents pitched in and helped out dining workers.
In Eliot House, during dinner hours on Saturday, students took shifts volunteering in the back washroom, washing dishes and taking over duties usually covered with ease by a full dining hall staff. Eliot residents Lucy A. Walsh ’15 and Gillian C. Stein ’15 helped sort silverware and stack plates.
“The staff has been doing a terrific job and we did not even notice that they were undermanned or struggling,” Walsh said enthusiastically. “But when we heard they could use the help, it was a no-brainer, plus, we thought it could be fun.”
Robert W. Lothman ’13 also joined the efforts in Eliot.
“Cleaning dishes and taking out the trash are chores I do at home,” he said as he emptied a bag of trash from the dining hall during his impromptu shift. “The dining staff here is so awesome and I would do anything I could to help out.”
Others students spent their time during the storm enjoying the snow day in more conventional ways.
With intense snowfall and high winds starting Friday afternoon and lasting throughout the night, many students reported that they remained indoors, watching movies, playing games, hanging out with friends, or studying.
Though most students could remain warm in their rooms, the heat in much of Ridgley Hall—one of three buildings designated as swing housing during the ongoing renovation of Old Quincy—stopped working on Friday night and was not fixed until the following afternoon, making for a frigid night for its residents.
“I noticed it getting pretty chilly in the room early Friday night,” recalled Emma R. Lipshultz ’15. “I didn’t think anything of it until I woke up on Saturday and was freezing, even with two sweatshirts and wool socks on.”
Katherine M. Kulik ’15, a Crimson photography editor, told a similar story. Kulik said she and other Ridgley residents tried to stay out of their rooms and enjoy the warmth of the main Quincy House building in rooms like its dining hall and Junior Common Room.
As the snow subsided on Saturday, groups of students could be seen across campus enjoying the winter wonderland that the storm left behind. Snowmen of all shapes and sizes began popping up in House courtyards, snowball fights broke out in the Yard and MAC Quad, and students used dining hall trays to sled down the snow-covered steps of Widener Library.
Students involved in varsity sports also got the opportunity to enjoy some of the fresh powdery snow, as many scheduled varsity competitions were either canceled or postponed due to weather.
Melissa L. Mullins ’14, a varsity basketball player, commented on the constantly changing schedule and how strange it was to wake up with a “game day mentality” only to find out that it would not be game day after all. For some players this happened multiple times as games were postponed on both Friday and Saturday.
“It was obviously a bummer to have games pushed back after spending the day preparing, getting excited to play, and even having our pregame meal,” Mullins said. “But it didn’t affect us because not only did we get to play in the snow, but we had three days to prepare for Cornell instead of just one.”
After spending the weekend surviving Nemo, the University stands poised to return to life as normal Monday. According to an email sent Sunday evening by Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison, shuttle service resumed Sunday afternoon and classes will follow a regular schedule on Monday,
“Harvard University and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will resume normal operations on Monday,” Ellison wrote.

Teams of volunteers worked around the clock to keep Cambridge’s homeless population out of harsh weather conditions during a weekend when more than two feet of snow fell on the city of Boston.
The student-run Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which is normally open only at night, housed 30 individuals all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, according to Kelly A. Sullivan ’14 and Charles A. Hobbs ’13, who are both administrative coordinators at the shelter.
Sullivan said that starting on Thursday night, teams of volunteers from the shelter and government agencies began combing the streets for homeless individuals, warning them of the oncoming storm, telling them where they might find shelter, and distributing passes for the MBTA. Sullivan said that Hurricane Sandy, the last unusually dangerous storm to hit New England, made it apparent that the homeless may be unaware of dangerous conditions even when many are scrambling to prepare for them.
“What we realized during Hurricane Sandy was that, even though we had seen Hurricane Sandy all over the news, people on the street may not be hooked up to that kind of information,” Sullivan said.
She said that because of building capacity restrictions, the shelter was unable to accommodate extra people, but it did remain open all day. The shelter guaranteed beds throughout the storm for those who stayed on Thursday night and helped arrange transportation for some people to travel to other, larger shelters with more flexible capacities.
“I think it worked fairly well,” Hobbs said. “Nobody came to us in the middle of the night.”
Hobbs said that some individuals who were not comfortable staying in the shelter remained outdoors even during the storm.
“They’re a whole different challenge,” Hobbs said, adding that volunteers worked to provide those people with blankets, food, and hot drinks. That effort, he said, was based at the First Parish Cambridge Unitarian Universalist Church in Harvard Square.
While the shelter’s policy is to stay open all day when the city of Cambridge declares a “snow emergency,” neither Sullivan nor Hobbs could remember a time when it housed people for three full days in a row.
“In the four years that I’ve [worked at the shelter], there’s never been a snow event that’s been this large,” Hobbs said. “It was a really crazy weekend for a lot of different reasons.”
Hobbs said that he was proud that the shelter was able to keep people out of the storm with “a lot of work from a lot of people.”
“Most of the folks who do need shelter—who want shelter—are able to find it,” Hobbs said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly series by The Back Page, Harvard beat  writers will discuss topics about a Crimson athletics team. In this  edition, basketball beat writers Hope Schwartz and David Freed discussed  the men’s basketball team’s future in the Ivy League as well as their  frontcourt rotation and ability to close out games.
 
David Freed: What worries me about this  team is that they always seem to play down to the level of its competition and that they can't hang onto leads. It happened in the  first game of the season against UMass and again this weekend against  Brown. Luckily, the Bears aren't as good as Chaz Williams and co. but it  did cost them against St. Mary's and they needed a huge comeback against  Dartmouth just to win that game. I see Harvard having trouble when it  can't push the ball or Siyani needs to take a rest just because the  offense really revolves around his drives. Also, free throw shooting has  not been up to par recently. Thoughts?
 
Hope Schwartz: On the flip  side of playing down to its competition, we've also seen this team play  up in amazing ways. While it definitely worries me that they needed an  epic comeback and a whole lot of luck to beat Dartmouth (literally the  worst team in the Ivy League... sorry Gabas Maldunas, but facts are  facts), Amaker and co. need only to look back to the end of 2012 to remember what  this team is capable of. In an upset win against Cal, we saw Wes  Saunders step up on defense against Bears top scorer Allen Crabbe, and a  strong offensive showing by the Crimson allowed the team to overcome  Crabbe's 27 points. Against St. Mary's, Jonah Travis came through huge  with 19 points and a dominant post presence, something the team has been  lacking all season. The point is that all the pieces are there, but it  remains to be seen whether it can all come together.
 
DF: Speaking of Travis, to me he's probably the most  interesting players on the team. Catherine Coppinger’s feature on him  last week does justice to the way he hustles and scrapes for loose  balls, even though he's a six-six center. However, down the stretch  Travis rarely will see the floor. Against Dartmouth, the entire comeback  was essentially made with Steve on the floor and Travis riding the  pine. I get that Steve is a better defensive player and compensates a  little bit more for Harvard's lack of length on the outside, but Jonah is a  more polished offensive player and, crucially, he shoots 65% from the  line against Steve's 57%. Especially looking forward against Princeton  and Ian Hummer, one of the two has to step up for Harvard to take down the  Tigers in two games that will probably decide the Crimson's season. On that note,  what do you make of Princeton? They were really underwhelming in  nonconference play—they could only score 42 points in 45 minutes against  Wagner—but they've gotten out of the gates strong with three straight  wins. Hummer leads them in literally every offensive category (points,  boards, assists, etc.) but is he good enough to beat  Harvard—essentially—on his own or will they need other players to step  up and make room? Hummer matches up with the weakest part of Harvard's team,  interior D, so moving forward it'll be important to try and make other  Tigers beat the Crimson.
 
HS: The Travis vs  Moundou-Missi debate is one of the most underrated story lines of the  season so far. After starting Mondou-Missi in the first five games of  the season, Amaker didn't seem too impressed with him averaging fewer  than five points per game. Travis is clearly the more powerful post  presence, but--and here I would disagree with you--he lacks the polish  necessary to be a consistent impact player down the stretch in close  games. Travis' scrappy style of play puts him at risk for foul  trouble, and he's fouled out three times this season. Moundou-Missi, on  the other hand, seems to be the more balanced player, coming down with  nine key rebounds against Brown and averaging more than twice as many as  Travis during conference play. However, going up against a player like  Hummer, it may be necessary to take a risk with Travis to compensate  with power on the other end. What would you do in Amaker's situation?
 
DF: Much like what the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics did  against Howard, it might be worth it to start with Travis and let him  get fouls and then just sub in Steve and Kenyatta as needed. Between  them there are 15 fouls Harvard can use to bother Hummer. That might be the  most effective strategy since the Crimson can try and tire him out of the course  of the game and take him out of the action. With Missi being the less  foul-prone of the two, I agree that it probably makes sense to use him  to end games, especially in close games where fouls can really harm us.  With Princeton losing Saturday, if Harvard can win the game at home  Saturday, it doesn't even need to win in Jadwin. But that only makes  this game—and Amaker's strategy going forward—that much more important.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It couldn’t be much worse for the Penn men’s basketball team.
After an underwhelming 2-12 non-conference record, the Quakers came into Ivy League play looking to silence the critics. The potential was there, with guard Miles Cartwright and forward Fran Dougherty combining as the league’s highest scoring duo. But Penn couldn’t get it done, falling to Cornell and Yale at home as the team played itself out of contention.
The Quakers haven’t just lost conference games; now they have lost key players as well. Dougherty—the team’s second leading scorer with 13.8 points per game despite missing eight games with mononucleosis—went down against Cornell with a dislocated elbow. He will likely be out for the rest of the season.
Junior guard Steve Rennard didn’t last much longer, reportedly tearing his plantar fascia in practice last Monday in Penn’s second season-ending injury of the week. Although he has averaged only 4.2 points per game this season, Rennard has been the Quakers’ most efficient scorer in conference play, shooting 60 percent from the field—including 57 percent from the arc.
Last time out, Penn was able to overcome the absence of the two juniors against Brown, and the Quakers picked up their second conference win of the season on Saturday. Penn started slowly but gradually accumulated momentum on offense, taking the lead by the break and closing out the game with a convincing 71-48 victory.
The Quakers looked towards Cartwright to get it done, and he stepped up, putting up a career-high 28 points and adding seven rebounds. Penn’s defense held the Bears to 23 points in the second half.
As the Quakers look to adapt to the new starting lineup, it remains to be seen whether Cartwright can continue to carry the team. Penn will need another source of offensive production, and the team is looking towards freshman guard Tony Hicks—averaging 12 points per game in conference play. Hicks, who has started three of Penn’s five Ivy League games, was the only other scorer in double digits against Brown with 15 points.
For the next two weekends, the Quakers will be on the road—starting with a stop at Lavietes next Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four hours before its tipoff against the Columbia Lions (10-10, 2-4 Ivy), the Harvard men’s basketball team (13-7, 5-1) remained one of two undefeated teams atop the Ivy League. After Yale pulled off a stunning upset at Jadwin Gymnasium Saturday night, defeating previously undefeated Princeton, the Crimson entered its Sunday matchup as the sole Ancient Eight squad without a loss.
It wouldn’t last.
The Lions gave Harvard its first loss in February, 78-63, and performed well in every facet of the game. Columbia’s performance was arguably its most complete of the season. The Lions shot 51 percent from the field—including 53 percent from behind the arc—outrebounded Harvard by eight, and boasted 18 assists against 10 turnovers (the Crimson finished with six assists against 13 turnovers).
“Certainly an outstanding performance by Columbia,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was obvious how well they played this afternoon.”
No opponent in Ivy League play had eclipsed the 50 percent mark against Harvard from beyond the three-point line before Columbia’s outburst on Sunday. The Lions scored more than any other Ivy League opponent had against the Crimson, boasted the largest rebounding margin (+8) of Harvard’s Ancient Eight opponents, and shot the highest percentage (50.9 percent) of any Crimson conference opponent this season.
FRANK(oski) AND SIMPLE
A large portion of the Lions’ damage was done by junior guard Steve Frankoski, who led the team with 27 points Sunday. Frankoski nailed five of the seven three-pointers he took, with many coming in transition as point guard Brian Barbour found him time after time as the trailer.
“I thought Frankoski was an amazing offensive weapon that they had today,” Amaker said. “They shot the ball well, got  him out of the blocks early and kept us on our heels throughout the game. We had no answer for him and I thought they played off of him really well.”
A 6’2” guard, Frankoski shoots nearly 46 percent from three-point territory. He stole the ball from Harvard co-captain Christian Webster on the first play of the game and a minute later started off the Columbia scoring with a three-pointer from the wing. Thirty-eight minutes later, he finished the night with two free throws from the line.
In the first half, Frankoski was the difference. Although the Crimson trailed by one or two for most of the half, the New Jersey native took over with five minutes remaining in the period. Nailing two free throws, Frankowski proceeded a minute later to nail back-to-back three-point jumpers from the corner. That brought the lead from one to seven and gave Frankoski 20 points at the break.
SHINING IN A LOSING EFFORT
Despite the loss, Harvard had a pair of stars submit noteable performances against the Lions. Sophomore Wesley Saunders had his most effective game of the season, missing only three total shots on the night. Saunders ended the day with 27 points on only 11 shots, earning himself 10 trips to the foul line and knocking down long jumper after long jumper in the first half to keep the Crimson in the game.
Saunders was the lone Crimson player to shoot over 50 percent as the rest of the team staggered to poor shooting nights. Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers made eight of 10 from the line but missed four of six shots and had five turnovers against only three assists. Webster missed five of his seven shots, including four of five treys, and sharpshooter junior Laurent Rivard connected on only two of his six attempts from behind the arc.
In total, the team hit only four of its thirteen shots from three for a 31 percent clip, 10 percent below its season average.
On the defensive end, sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi gave Harvard valuable bench minutes. With a small rotation in place (Harvard’s other bench players combined for 13 minutes, one point, and no rebounds or assists), Moundou-Missi is the Crimson’s key reserve. On Sunday, he put up six points, seven rebounds, and six blocks in just 27 points of action.
“I thought Steve gave us great energy and effort,” Amaker said. “He made up for mistakes on dribble penetration. He protected the rim as much as he could. I thought he did as much as he possible could do. Looking at his stat line, we can’t ask for much more from Steve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years ago this month, on Feb. 1, 2010, a highly-touted freshman and sophomore went head-to-head for the first time at TD Banknorth Garden.
The rookie, Boston College’s Chris Kreider, scored a goal to help lead his Eagles to a dominating 6-0 Beanpot semifinal win over Harvard, whose own talented forward, Alex Killorn ’12, registered three shots on net in the loss.
The pair would not meet again until Sunday night, when they faced off once more in an NHL Arena.
But this time, at Madison Square Garden, the intracity rivals were no longer collegiate stars. Instead, they were representing their professional teams—Kreider is on the New York Rangers, and Killorn, making his NHL debut, was playing for the Tampa Bay Lightning.
The right wing was called up by the Lightning on Sunday, marking a rapid ascension to hockey’s highest stage for the former Crimson standout who graduated just nine months ago.
“We’re happy for him,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He's a great kid, was a great player for us, a great person and he's worked really hard. We’re very happy to see his dream coming true, having a chance to play in the National Hockey League. And what a great venue, Madison Square Garden. So we'll be pulling hard for him and we're very proud of how far he's come.”
Under the lights at the world’s most famous arena, wearing No. 17, and playing on the road team’s third line, Killorn made an immediate impact, registering an assist and two shots on goal in a 5-1 Rangers win. He also accumulated two minutes in the penalty box for high-sticking Kreider, who left Boston College during his junior year to join the Rangers late last season.
“I think I got the jitters out of the way in the first period,” Killorn said. “I felt a lot better in the 2nd.”
His parents—who postponed a vacation to Puerto Rico—as well as other family members and friends were in attendance to see the game. Killorn told The Syracuse Post-Standard that his mother cried when he told her the news of his call-up.
“It's a really good feeling,” Killorn said. “You don't know when it's going to come.”
The feeling finally came on Saturday, when Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman—a former hockey star in his own right—made the decision to waive wing Dana Tyrell and promote Killorn, a third round pick by the team in 2007.
"He's a big body that protects the puck extremely well," Lightning coach Guy Boucher told The Tampa Bay Times. "He's got a great shot and is extremely smart."
The Harvard grad said he received the news from Syracuse GM Julien BriseBois, who woke him from a pregame nap.
"He asked me if I was ready to come help Tampa beat the Rangers," Killorn told The Tampa Bay Times.
Though he was unable to do that, the wing’s promotion nonetheless represented a rapid rise to the NHL for the former All-American, who ranked in the top five in the country in goals and points per game as a Crimson senior.
Late in the 2011-2012 campaign, Killorn joined the American Hockey League’s Norfolk Admirals for the playoffs, scoring two goals and tallying four assists while helping his team to a league championship.
After the season, the Admirals were dropped as the Lightning’s developmental affiliate in favor of the Syracuse Crunch, for whom the Harvard alum played in 44 contests this year.
During that span, Killorn scored 16 goals and registered a team-high 22 assists. His 38 points were good for 17th-most in the league and were third most among rookies.
“We talked to him not to get frustrated,” Donato said. “He didn't get brought into camp when the season started…[but] it was just a matter of time. He earned that opportunity.”
Killorn’s call-up makes him the third Harvard graduate currently playing in the NHL, joining the Pittsburgh Penguins’ Craig Adams ’99 and Dylan Reese ’07.
A number of his other former teammates expressed excitement over the news on Twitter on Saturday.
“Big congrats and goodluck to @Akillorn19 suiting up for the Lightning tomorrow at Madison Square Garden,” sophomore Tommy O’Regan tweeted.
“Big congrats to my idol @Akillorn19 on making his NHL debut tomorrow. Surprised it took this long. Guy deserves it,” wrote senior Connor Morrison.
“So pumped for you @Akillorn19 Congratulations. Crush it and stick up there man. No better debut than under the lights of MSG,” added Ryan Grimshaw ’12.
Killorn, for his part, said he is looking forward to getting his professional career started.
“I'm going to want to play big, use my size, be reliable defensively and chip in offensively,'' Killorn said.
"It's going to take a little time to adapt," he added. "But if I play my game, even if I make a mistake...[things] will be fine."

The Harvard men’s tennis team emerged victorious on all fronts this weekend: not only did it avoid the blizzard that swamped Cambridge with a trip to Evanston, Ill., but it also earned two wins this weekend at the Combe Tennis Center at Northwestern University.
On Saturday, the No. 47 Crimson (4-3) squeaked by the host No. 33 Wildcats (9-3), 4-3, after two doubles tiebreakers gave the decisive doubles point to Harvard. Then, on Sunday, the Crimson defeated No. 40 Vanderbilt (5-3) by the same score.
“It was a great weekend,” co-captain Andy Nguyen said. “We fought hard and it was definitely good to get these big wins against good [major conference] schools.”
HARVARD 4, VANDERBILT 3
Although the Crimson beat the Commodores by the same margin as it did Northwestern, it was a much more comfortable 4-3 victory.
Fish spoke well of his team’s play relative to its play against Northwestern.
“We were even better [than on Saturday],” he said. “We came at them from the beginning.”
Unlike in Saturday’s tiebreakers in the doubles matches, Harvard earned easier doubles victories against the Commodores. On the second court, freshman Nicky Hu and Andy Nguyen scored an 8-3 victory over Vanderbilt’s Gonzales Austin and Suresh Eswaran, and the No. 1 team of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster took an 8-4 win to give the Crimson the doubles point.
In singles, sophomore Alex Steinroeder and Andy Nguyen both won easily—6-1, 6-2, and 6-1, 6-1, respectively—to give Harvard an early 3-0 lead that would ensure they would not have to come back as they did against the Wildcats.
The Commodores made things interesting by winning three singles matches, including No. 17 Ryan Lipman’s fifth straight match victory. He beat the Crimson’s Denis Nguyen 6-2, 6-3 at No. 1. But Harvard sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri pulled away in the third set for a 7-6, 2-6, 6-0 win to give the Crimson its fourth point and the victory.
HARVARD 4, NORTHWESTERN 3
Although Northwestern entered the weekend with an 8-1 record, Harvard was able to produce a dramatic and narrow 4-3 triumph.
The Wildcats started things off with an 8-4 victory over Steinroeder and Chaudhuri in No. 3 doubles, but the Crimson struck back when the No. 2 team of Andy Nguyen and Hu edged Northwestern with a 8-7 (7-2) victory.
Harvard completed the doubles comeback when the first team of Denis Nguyen and MacMaster survived a challenge from the Wildcats’ Sidarth Balaji and Raleigh Smith, winning 8-7 (13-11) to give the Crimson the doubles point.
That comeback would prove pivotal in giving Harvard victory.
“In both doubles matches that we won we were down multiple match points,” Andy Nguyen said. “So we were very lucky to get the doubles point.”
Northwestern responded in singles, though, when No. 3 Balaji rolled over Steinroeder, 6-2, 6-2, to tie the score. The Wildcats then claimed a win at No. 6, and by the time Northwestern’s Raleigh Smith beat Chaudhuri 7-5, 6-2 in the second slot, the Wildcats had jumped out to a 3-1 overall lead while the rest of the singles matches were all in the third set.
The Crimson needed to win all three matches to claim victory, and they did just that. First, at No. 5, Hu defeated Northwestern’s Chris Jackman, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. In fourth singles, Andy Nguyen won the second and third sets for a 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 victory that evened the match.
The No. 1 singles match would decide the contest, and Denis Nguyen came back from a first-set hole in defeating the Wildcats’ Spencer Wolf 5-7, 6-1, 7-5 to complete the 4-3 win.
“We were lucky to get [the win] but really excited at the same time,” Andy Nguyen said. “We feel really good, especially because both matches could’ve gone either way.”
Fish was encouraged by the way his players fought for victory.
“The best thing about yesterday was the players continuing to compete,” he said. “We dug in and came back, and won at the end.”

Now that the semester has begun in earnest, long hours at Lamont and nights when you "meant to go to brain break for 15 minutes but stayed for three hours" are just around the corner. Fortunately, Flyby has compiled a study playlist to help guide you through your most unproductive evenings.
9:00 p.m. "I'll Make a Man Out of You" from "Mulan"
When you have a pset to finish, you've caught up on all your TV for the week, and you're ready to get down to business.
10:12 p.m. "Junk Food Junkie" by X-Ray Spex
When you've been in the library for 72 minutes and have only checked Facebook five times. Hightail it to brain break for some well-deserved peanut butter jelly time.

When eating alone is pathetic, and you've gotta get with your friends—and tell them that there's salsa at brain break.
11:38 p.m. "Hakuna Matata" from "The Lion King"

We may have to go back to school on Monday (while both Yale and Boston Public Schools get the day off—boo you, Harvard), but luckily this weekend allowed us two and a half days of fun in the snow before the inevitably unenjoyable Monday morning trudge.
Flyby hereby invites you to take a few minutes to relive the good times of Blizzard Nemo in its pre-slush phase. Enjoy!
For starters, we asked Harvard students to send us their snowstorm snapshots via Instagram or Twitter using the hashtag #flybysnow, and we got some great submissions.
You can find the #flybysnow gallery here. (*An asterisk next to the photographer's name indicates that he or she is an inactive Crimson editor.)
Some of you sent us videos and images that were far too hot for Twitter or Instagram to handle. Crimson Staff Writer Armaghan N. Behlum '15 shared his 360-degree photospheres of Quincy House Courtyard and Tercentenary Theater, and others sent videos of friends sledding down Widener Steps.
Crimson Staff Writer C.C. Gong '15 reported that John T. Hoffer '16 and Jack F. Weyen '16 spent three hours constructing an igloo in front of Canaday on Saturday, then dragged a futon and some pillows in. They planned to have a party in the igloo, which could fit about a dozen people.
We at Flyby spotted the ever-adorable Dean Thomas A. Dingman '67 swiping students into lunch in Annenberg on Saturday. We're glad he was able to lend a hand to the tireless HUDS workers who, along with FMO staff, have been working since Friday morning to keep us fed and clear the snow. They're the true heroes of this blizzard-y weekend, and Harvard students know it.

You may have heard of the new dating app Tinder, in which you look at the name, age and profile picture of local singles and swipe left or right based on your approval. If the feeling is mutual, it's a match, and you can start communicating immediately.
In the name of scholarly research and objectifying men, I downloaded the app. Two days later, I have over fifteen matches and only one restraining order. Now an expert at Tinder, I've decided to provide you all with a few of my tips for success.
1. Add an animal
It's a well-known fact that a man with a group of women, or a woman posing next to a man, makes him or her psychologically more desirable. What is less of a known fact is that animals have the same effect. If you put an animal in your profile picture—be it a cat, a dog, or a starfish—people are more likely to like you. 39-year-old Dave just used a picture of a bear. Damn! I'd swipe that.
2. Always assume the worst
When you are looking at a photo with multiple people (or multiple animals), always assume that the single person in question is the least attractive of the lot. If it is a pair at the beach with one member shirtless, your potential match is probably the fully dressed and less toned of the two. When looking at large group photos, don't be surprised if your match is the one with the paper bag covering his or her face, or, as in many cases, the person taking the photo. But don't let this stop you from liking them; a good photographer is hard to come by!
3. Use emoticons
Words can be awkward. So if you do get a match it is best to start the communication with emoticons. When someone says "heyyy," try responding with a winky-face or an Emoji of a bowl of Ramen. I always like using the chicken-hatching-out-of-the-egg emoticon to get the conversation rolling. There is nothing sexier than subtle allusions to cage free produce. Only use the English language when it becomes completely necessary, which would be to clarify your absurd use of emoticons.
4. Blame a friend
If things get out of hand—if a random food emoticon goes unanswered or a match refuses your job offer to photograph your sister's wedding—blame it all on a friend. "Sorry," you should communicate with a bashful-looking smiley face emoticon, "my friend took my phone." Not only does this save face, but it also creates the impression that you have a friend.

Dear Harvard,
 
Welcome to "Listen Up," Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed up seniors from their futon in Winthrop. Senior spring is a time for writing a thesis, reflecting on your time at Harvard, and finding a job. We're avoiding these things by taking on your problems instead.
 
To get our advice-giving endeavor off the ground, we need your questions. Everything is anonymous, so don't be nervous! No one will find out how crazy you are. We've yet to meet anyone on this campus who doesn't need a good weekly (daily?) therapy session, so we know you're out there and you need us. Are you a freshman boy shivering outside The Fox? Not sure how speak to/make eye contact with that cute boy in section without terrifying him and embarrassing yourself? Is your roommate stealing your cheese sticks?
 
We can help!
 
Maybe.
 
Send us your pressing life questions here! 
 
Love and Life Lessons,
Sarah & Julia
