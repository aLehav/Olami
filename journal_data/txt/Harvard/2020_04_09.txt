After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All rom-com sequels are bad. I cannot claim to have seen every single romantic comedy sequel, or make the executive decision that they are all individually terrible. But the rom-com sequel itself is conceptually flawed and needs to be retired.
Let’s consider what a rom-com aims to do in the first place. Romantic comedies are built to be pure entertainment. The comedic elements keep an audience engaged and upbeat while the romance provides some escapism, maybe even a window into the viewer’s ideal relationship. Whether the ending entails a confession of love, a proposal, or even a breakup, a rom-com always leaves its audience with a “happily ever after.”
Let’s then consider the premise of a sequel: to build on the broader universe of an original story.
What does an “expanded universe” look like in a romantic comedy? If the first movie ends in a wedding, does the second movie show the same couple applying for a mortgage and driving their kids to preschool? Where’s the escapism in that?
Some sequels knowingly go through the motions of the first film again. But what reason would there be to repeat the plot of a rom-com? Maybe the couple has broken up by the time the sequel starts and the protagonist now has to find love again, but that just destroys the entire story that was originally established.
Let’s look at some concrete examples. Recently, Netflix released a sequel to their rom-com smash hit “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.” The first movie ended as all high school rom-coms should, with Lara Jean Covey and Peter Kavinsky kissing on a football field. The sequel falls squarely into the “expanded universe” category, as we see the beginnings of Lara Jean and Peter’s newly official relationship. But because it’s a movie, and movies have to find a way to create tension and drama to bring the story to a climax, the two almost break up! Why make a sequel if it risks destroying the picture-perfect relationship that drove the first film?
Or take the “Legally Blonde” sequel, “Red, White & Blonde.” This franchise goes the route of rendering the original romance entirely pointless in the plot of the sequel. Elle and Emmett aren’t even in the same room for most of the movie — all the romance we see is them figuring out wedding details over the phone. In my book, it doesn’t even qualify as a rom-com.
Finally, let’s look at the “Miss Congeniality” sequel, “Armed and Fabulous.” The love interest from the first movie, Eric, doesn’t even appear in the sequel as he breaks up with Gracie over the phone within the first 20 minutes. The sequel essentially goes through the motions of the first film all over again. What’s the use of making a sequel in the first place if it regurgitates the plot of the original?
Rom-coms often get a bad reputation for being too vapid, but their unique element of mindless entertainment gives them value. What is truly vapid is the concept of creating a sequel to stories which have already reached their clear, rightful conclusion. Let the stories end where they end, and let the audience imagine the perfect future that awaits our protagonists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During her high school days, boys called Megan a “stallion.” At first, she worried it was an insult. But when her uncle explained it to her — “that means you tall and fine,” he told the 5’10” Houston native — she decided to own it. “Oh yeah, that is me!” she told her CheatSheet interviewer, and “since then, everybody’s just been calling me ‘stallion.’” Of course Megan Thee Stallion’s famous confidence isn’t reserved for her appearance. Her meteoric rise is a product of that same strong personality. More than anything though, Megan’s strength and boldness shine when she raps, always without an ounce of doubt in her voice. Her latest work showcases exactly that bravado. At the chilly beginning of spring, Megan gave her quarantined listeners a taste of hot girl summer with the release of her newest EP, “Suga.”
“Suga” is a statement about who Megan is, and while it appears similar in lyrical content to her previous works, she offers fresher takes on the badass she’s always been. “Ain’t Equal” kicks off the EP both vulnerable and strong as Megan raps, “I lost my mommy and my granny in the same month.” She juxtaposes the darker content with a pointed beat and a fast paced flow that signals to listeners that she is unafraid to confront the obstacles that come her way. Megan targets her haters and makes sure they understand who they’re dealing with. “Ain’t Equal” comes across as powerful and unstoppable.
In a similar vein, “Savage” describes Megan as a sexual woman who towers over men and women alike, highlighting her strengths with its bouncy flow and badass lyrics. Megan punctuates each descriptive word with a laid back sense of control, leisurely rapping while simultaneously staying on top of the beat. Megan pairs this flow with her signature confident lyrics like “Let’s play a game, Simon says I’m still that bitch, ayy,” keeping her disses and braggadocious claims short, simple, and rhythmic. She clearly states who’s boss; in one of the hardest lines of the entire EP, she refers to the man she plays around with as trash. “Bitch, that’s my trash, you the maid, so you bagged him,” she raps. She’s scathing, smug, and irresistable.
New perspectives emerge in softer songs that hint at a more emotional Megan. “Hit My Phone” uses a g-funk beat reminiscent of older hip-hop songs. It also features Kehlani, who brings a more melodic and delicate undertone to the song, and lyrically creates a compelling story about Megan and a man she has her eyes on. The song fades out at the end, generating a nostalgic feel that emphasizes the emotions of the singers. On the other hand, “Crying in the Car” has Megan singing “All of them nights that I cried in the car / All them tears turned into ice on my arms” in autotune, with background vocals and a plea to God in the chorus grounding her content in real, human emotion.
Despite the more vulnerable approaches in her songs, Megan is at her best when she is in charge. In “B.I.T.C.H.,” she is in charge lyrically. “I ain’t turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy I been that / You tryna make me something that I ain’t, and I ain’t with that,” she raps. Throughout the song, Megan scoffs at the assumption that she needs a man.
Another highlight of the track is “Stop Playing” featuring Gunna, whose words drip with ease and swagger. Megan not only complements Gunna’s style with a heavy-sounding, deep voice — she occasionally dips lower than Gunna’s raps, and subtly shows who’s wearing the pants.
Throughout “Suga,” Megan both embraces and innovates on rap tropes. She may be known for her explicit lyrics, or lines that she’s “all about money,” but her music goes deeper than brags. Rather, when she sings about sexual liberation while leading an all-women team of backup dancers, as in the video for “B.I.T.C.H.,” she uses rap posturing to invert the role of women in pop culture from object to in-charge. Through Megan Thee Stallion’s videos and music music, sexuality is not weaponized against women — rather, “me and my friends,” as she describes her dancers, are taking control on their own terms.

H.G. Wells’ influential science fiction novel “The Invisible Man” has spawned a myriad of adaptations since its publication in 1897, notably a critically acclaimed film in 1933 and several more movies and TV series since then. But writer-director Leigh Whannell’s 2020 rendition of “The Invisible Man” is more than a rehash of the same familiar story; Whannell freshens the classic tale by following not the titular invisible man, but a new character instead. Enter Cecilia Kass.
Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is a woman fleeing her abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), an expert in the field of optics. She seeks refuge at the home of longtime friend James (Aldis Hodge) and his teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Just two weeks into her stay with them, Cecilia’s sister (Harriet Dyer) informs her that Adrian committed suicide, meaning she no longer has to live in fear of him. Sinister occurrences, however, lead Cecilia to believe that Adrian is not dead but instead using his technology to turn invisibile and continue to torture her. With this new storyline, Whannell’s “The Invisible Man” is an engrossing, well-paced rollercoaster that not only arouses fear but also effectively portrays the toxic and harrowing nature of abusive relationships.
Moss delivers a gripping performance with a difficult role — a tortured woman led to doubt her own sanity. Though Cecilia is convinced that Adrian is still alive, everyone around her believes that post-traumatic stress is causing her to lose her grip on reality. “He said that I could never leave him, that wherever I went he would find me,” she tells Adrian’s brother, desperate for him to admit that the suicide was staged. Scenes with only Cecilia and the invisible Adrian place more pressure on Moss as the sole actor, but she holds her own as she convincingly portrays the at once frightened yet defiant character.
The lack of a visible villain could have been a detriment to “The Invisible Man,” but it ultimately adds to the suspense. While Adrian’s harassment of Cecilia begins with small, if sometimes clichéd actions, like burning her breakfast and pulling off her sheets at night, it gradually escalates to acts of extreme violence.
Whannell intelligently conveys the manipulative behavior of domestic violence as Adrian expertly uses his invisibility to isolate Cecilia from the people that care about her, leaving her alone and vulnerable. H.G. Wells’ novel leaves room for sympathy for the titular character, rendering his violent behavior the result of his irreversible state of invisibility; in the film, however, Adrian can become visible again whenever he wants. With this significant alteration, the film allows audiences to see the often disregarded narrative of victimized women. Whannell’s film thus empathizes with victims of domestic violence and highlights the cruel nature of gaslighting that can feed unequal power dynamics. Throughout the movie, Cecilia maintains her version of the truth, even when Adrian’s stunts and manipulations set her up to appear crazy. In one of the few scenes where Adrian is shown without his invisibility suit, he’s just as controlling and deceptive as Cecilia has described him to be. “I need you, Cecilia,” he says, trying to convince her that their relationship is codependent. Though Adrian is charismatic with his good looks and smooth talking, he never crosses the line to become a likable character.
Although formulaic in structure, “The Invisible Man”’s talented cast and updated plot differentiate it from the plethora of other horror films. Aldis Hodge is naturally likable as James, Cecilia’s well-intentioned but disbelieving friend, and Oliver Jackson-Cohen effectively captures the cunning nature of the sociopathic Adrian. It’s Elisabeth Moss’s multifaceted and authentic performance, though, that truly holds the film together. Her strong-willed and fearless character, at the helm of a storyline far more substantive than most horror films, is the highlight of this tense and riveting remake.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, “The Invisible Man” is now available for rent early on video-on-demand.

“Waves,” the latest A24 film directed by Trey Edward Shults, takes us on the roller coaster ride of suburban American adolescence. But what makes the film so unique is that it doesn’t stop there: After the ride ends with Tyler’s (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) psychological breakdown, “Waves” blurs the lines of conventional narrative by continuing after the conclusion of its central arc. Schults makes clever artistic choices to mirror his film’s ever-changing tone — namely immersive camera work and judicious editing.
The film is tonally split in half, with the first part of the movie following Tyler, a high school senior who has everything going for him — a good girlfriend, athlete status, and a supportive family. But with all these gifts comes great responsibility, and Tyler ultimately cracks under the pressure. The latter half of the film follows the rest of the family, consisting of his parents Ronald (Sterling K. Brown) and Catharine (Renée Elise Goldsberry), and his sister Emily (Taylor Russell), navigating a life where Tyler must pay the price for his destructive behavior. The film takes on two very different realities, pre- and post-tragedy.
From the opening scene on, the camera is an active participant in the film, and by extension, so is the audience. The film opens with Tyler driving with his girlfriend Alexis (Alexa Demie), who rides shotgun on a gorgeous summer day, with music blaring and Alexis’ hair blowing in the wind. The camera, situated between the two characters, pans around and around in circles, from Alexis to Tyler, back to Alexis, back to Tyler. Schults’ active lens injects the shot with vigor, life, and playfulness. The role of the participatory camera is essential throughout much of the film. In one scene, where Tyler is at a bonfire after breaking up with Alexis, the fluid, wavy motion of the camera almost shares in his confused sorrow.
Schults also uses choppy editing to reflect Tyler’s chaotic life. In the first half, these cuts are decisive and create a disjunction that establishes a fast pace paralleling the frenzied nature of Tyler’s life. For example, in the beginning of the film, there’s a series of jump cuts from a shot of Tyler’s room to photograph prints of him to a beach day with Alexis to a friend’s party and back to the car.
When Schults needs to change the tonal direction of the film, he accompanies this with appropriate formal elements. In this way, the camera movement and editing become self-effacing, which lends a sense of calm. However, this calm comes across as emptiness when put together with the sobering visuals of a broken family: Emily is almost always alone or with her new boyfriend, Luke, and the few shots of Ronald and Catharine are of them either grieving or arguing.
The film ends with parallel cuts from Catharine visiting Tyler in prison to Tyler in his cell looking at a picture of Alexis to Emily in a park to Ronald fishing, with soft acoustic music playing throughout. These final shots encapsulate the impressive range of human experiences on display in “Waves,” from high school to death to sorrow to repentance. The breadth of experience covered is overwhelming at times, and the second half sometimes feels too tonally detached from the first, as if "Waves" is really just two stories haphazardly strung together into one. Despite that, Shults’ expert audiovisual techniques enable the viewer to viscerally experience such different realities. “Waves” is able to critically engage with the concept of narrative — where it begins, where it ends, and how they can be interwoven through time and character.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the newly admitted students in the Class of 2024:
In the middle of this pandemic, you have a completely unrelated — and very exciting — decision to make about where you’ll spend the next four years. Many of you had the lucky misfortune of receiving acceptance letters from multiple colleges, and eventually, you’ll have to narrow them down to one. Admissions offices have given you a brief period to think it through, and it’s up to you to figure out how to make the final call.
You might be familiar with the Monty Hall problem — a puzzle from the namesake game show where an individual is shown three closed doors. Behind two of them are goats, but behind the final one is a car. The contestant begins by indicating an initial guess for the right door. The host then opens one of the remaining two to reveal a goat, helping the contestant to winnow out an option. In the puzzle, it’s mathematically proven that switching one’s guess to the other unopened door always delivers a higher probability of winning the car.
You are, as high school seniors, in a situation that is somewhat similar but also quite different. You’re staring at a number of options. And while there are no goats, all of the doors this time will remain closed, except the one you eventually choose. Most importantly, there’s no existing formula to tell you how best to do this.
So how do you decide which one to open? If you’re like most newly admitted students, you might have a loose set of criteria in your head. You may look at artificial heuristics, like which college has the highest spot in the Forbes college ranking, or the best biology department. Perhaps you try to compare the campuses, maybe talk with a few students. If you’re like some people I know, you may even browse each school’s course catalog.
Yet, in the very end — and you may feel it already — most of these metrics won’t end up offering much more clarity. After all, the college rankings were decided by a third party who probably never even visited. Your impression of a campus might be skewed because it was raining the day you were there, or because the online visit didn’t work that well. The undergraduate classes at each college are, in reality, pretty much the same. And there’s a good chance that you may change your major, and come to love — as many of us have — a subject you’d never experienced in high school.
With hindsight, you’ll realize that the biggest factors in your initial decision become small parts of your life on campus, no matter how robust you think you’ve made your criteria today. After all, evaluating a university based on one student’s experience or a faculty-to-student ratio is like trying to figure out the plot of a novel by sampling only two words--on pages 5 and 234.
This idea was captured well in a famous statement by Donald Rumsfeld, who explained:
“There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. We also know there are known unknowns … things we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”
The journalists at Rumsfeld’s press conference chuckled at this wordplay, but it carries with it a pretty large kernel of truth. In most decisions we make, we usually consider only the known knowns. Maybe you even account for the known unknowns. But don’t forget about the final category: the unknown unknowns. And in retrospect, 90 percent of what makes college so great will be from that last category.
The most memorable aspects are likely to be unplanned, and certainly impossible to foresee from high school. You’ll never even guess them. My own include: running — along with my freshman roommate — a last-minute presidential campaign, promising to abolish the student government at Harvard (we nearly won); taking a trip across Ethiopia with my blockmates for Thanksgiving; and spending a summer divided between working in the most interesting parts of government and teaching high school students at Harvard’s center in Greece.
It’s true that had I gone somewhere else, virtually everything that I’d known for the last three years would have been completely different. I would never have come to know my closest friends, taken the classes that shaped my current worldview, or been a part of this school that I love. But that’s all right, because while this exact experience isn't available elsewhere, something similar most definitely is. You shouldn’t worry too much about inventing a formula for something that cannot be engineered. Monty Hall be damned.
So my advice is short: Follow your heart. Choose one of the doors, and don’t look back. Chances are, you’ll have found the car — and four fantastic years to go along with it.

COVID-19 has most of us locked down in our homes glued to our screens, either browsing social media or binge-watching Tiger King on Netflix to see what the fuss is all about. We listen to officials on the news constantly, many of them telling us that COVID-19 does not care about our class, religion, or race — the disease infects anybody it can. In theory, that is true; however, what I have seen and heard over the past couple of weeks shows that racial dynamics are not absent during this crisis. The virus may not care who you are, but society still does.
When I go out in Harvard Square, I see multiple individuals on the streets running in and out of Sweetgreen or Felipe’s to deliver food to customers who placed an order online. I also see homeless people outside the Coop unable to afford a home to stay in. Many individuals have to go out on the streets and into crowded locations like public transit to make sure they have enough to feed their families. For some sectors of society, social distancing is a privilege they do not have, leaving them more vulnerable to the virus than others.
Data shows that minorities are disproportionately affected by the virus in numerous parts of the country. As of April 8 in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, 42 out of 59 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 were people who were black or African American. Despite comprising only 27 percent of the county’s population, African Americans in Milwaukee make up 45 percent of the coronavirus cases and 71 percent of the deaths.
In New York City, data from the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development shows that the communities hit hardest by the pandemic are the communities where a higher percentage of the population is black or brown and where many residents work service industry jobs. In Philadelphia, the highest percentages of positive tests are coming from ZIP codes that have a large minority population.  In Chicago, African Americans account for about 68 percent of total deaths but only make 30 percent of Chicago’s total population. Finally, right in Harvard’s backyard of Boston, high concentrations of COVID-19 cases are found in neighborhoods home to large black, Latino, and immigrant communities.
So what accounts for this inequity if the virus itself does not care who you are?
A dichotomy between people who must be on the streets and people who can continue their lives via screens during this pandemic is apparent. According to the Economic Policy Institute, “less than one in five black workers and roughly one in six Hispanic workers are able to work from home.” These minority groups are not afforded the privilege of working from home and must put themselves at risk as they perform jobs that keep our society functioning.
Online, my social media feed is full of screenshots of Zoom chats; in many instances, minorities are nowhere to be found. For example, a LinkedIn post made by the Associate Director of Talent Acquisition at Harvard exposes a lack of racial diversity in their “great team.”
We find the same lack of diversity in the professors who lead our now online classes from the safety of their homes. Only 8 percent of the roughly 1,000 tenured faculty at Harvard are underrepresented minorities, which includes people who are black, Latinx, and Native American. This faculty ratio is perhaps more closely representative of the demographics of those who can actually stay at home during this pandemic. Harvard is not immune to the social forces that are landing more minorities in the hospital, and might actually play a role in perpetuating them.
The truth is that many in the majority have the luxury to be shielded from the virus in their private homes. If you are sequestered in your vacation home in Nantucket, your familial home in the suburbs, or your penthouse overlooking the city, stop complaining about boredom and leftover food. Please stop admonishing those on the streets gasping for survival.
I unequivocally encourage everyone who can to stay home; however, I am painfully aware that this is not a possibility for everyone in this country. It is apparent that social distancing is a privilege, that the ability to follow the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines is a privilege, and that this pandemic has shed a light, once again, on the widespread inequality in American society. The inequitable distribution of opportunities to minorities at institutions like Harvard is proof of the dynamics that perpetuate this system.
And if nothing changes, minority communities will keep on being patsies to the current and future pandemics in the home of the free, where many are slaves to the biases of the past in our supposedly à la mode twenty-first-century society.
Let this pandemic, which is as capricious as it is implacable, be a catalyst towards an equitable society and an equitable Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of the coronavirus pandemic, private universities and state university systems around the country are offering their now-vacant dormitories to local hospitals to alleviate the burden of the public health crisis. As surges in coronavirus patients overwhelm hospitals, these much-needed spaces relieve the pressure on hospitals and are essential to public health efforts. The University has begun to respond in recent days, partnering with MIT to provide $500,000 in funding for a temporary emergency shelter for homeless residents of Cambridge. Harvard has also offered its Harvard Square Hotel to house emergency services and healthcare workers who need to stay in close proximity to hospitals and away from their families.
We encourage the University to do more. Harvard should expand its efforts by expressing its willingness to collaborate more closely with the City of Cambridge and the State of Massachusetts, especially with regard to repurposing its facilities. While the safety of students and staff still living on campus must obviously be protected, this is an all hands on deck type of crisis. Harvard has significant financial and physical resources that can be used to combat the coronavirus and further help those in need within our community.
The discourse around repurposing dorm space has largely focused on alleviating hospital capacity. While many universities offering their physical spaces have earmarked their dormitories for COVID-19 patients or healthcare workers, we believe Harvard should also especially consider using its physical resources to support the local homeless community, whose situation is in no small part related to the University’s presence in Cambridge hiking up housing prices for decades.
Coronavirus inevitably compounds the danger homelessness presents. Homeless shelters are perennially cramped spaces — an issue compounded by shelters being forced to close and turn people away amid the outbreak — and unless these spaces are de-densified, a humanitarian disaster awaits. It may have already arrived — a devastating 30 percent of homeless Bostonians screened for coronavirus thus far have tested positive. Homeless Cantibrigians in shelters are unable to adopt best practices for limiting the virus’s spread, such as social distancing and self-isolation, and are much more likely to contract the virus and face dangerous consequences without access to healthcare. These circumstances not only expose an already at-risk group to more unaffordable health risks, but will also complicate efforts to stem community infections.
We have a long, difficult road ahead before a return to more normal times. In the face of these challenges, Harvard should consider what it can do without compromising the safety of its current students and staff. By collaborating with the state of Massachusetts and the city of Cambridge, Harvard can play its part in helping combat COVID-19.

The Somerville Emergency Department will terminate its services on April 30, bringing the Somerville Hospital to an official end after over 128 years of service.
Somerville Hospital is part of the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), which proposed to close the facilities after “usage fell off a cliff,” as CHA vice-chair Gerald McCue was quoted saying in a recent Cambridge Day article. As part of the “Healthy Somerville 2022” initiative, the emergency department will be replaced with an urgent care center. The initiative also includes plans to build a new Care Center in Union Square and renovate the CHA Central Street Care Center, among others. The Somerville urgent care center will be open from nine a.m. to nine p.m. seven days a week and will be equipped to treat conditions that need “immediate attention, but are not serious enough for an [emergency department] visit.”
The decision to close the emergency department was finalized in July 2019, and as of right now, the emergency department will see its final patients next month.
Some have fiercely opposed the departure of the emergency department, however. Members of the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA) have spoken against its closure at hearings, and an MNA pamphlet entitled “Save Emergency Services at Somerville Hospital” outlines possible negative consequences of the closure. According to the pamphlet, the loss of emergency services will “endanger lives,” “impact the most vulnerable in [the] community,” and “impact other hospitals and communities.”
Co-chair of the Somerville Hospital Bargaining Unit Lisa C. Valley-Shah is an emergency department nurse at Somerville Hospital who has opposed the closure of the department “from the beginning.” Among her concerns is the fate of Somerville’s “underserved” population.
“We have a homeless population. We have a population of psychiatric patients, and there’s limits on psychiatric beds. We also serve a population of people in which English is not their primary language, so there’s many barriers,” Valley-Shah says. She argues that some people may not have the means to travel to the Cambridge Hospital — the next closest hospital — and others may not understand that the hospital has become an urgent care center and “still come seeking care at higher levels than the center will be able to provide.”
The CHA website, however, states that a three-year planning process resulted in these changes that will better meet “the needs of the community.” Furthermore, it claims that the conversion will “maintain a strong safety net for vulnerable populations.” In an emailed statement, David Cecere, spokesperson for the CHA, wrote “Our Cambridge Hospital ED is located less than two miles away on the Cambridge/Somerville line. We are always evaluating our staffing needs and will adjust accordingly to deliver the right level of care.”
Declining resources at the soon-to-be Somerville urgent care center is another potential issue. While inpatient services have not been offered at the Somerville emergency department since 2009 and a variety of services — blood tests and labs, x-rays, and IV’s, to name a few — will still be provided at the urgent care center, Valley-Shah is more concerned with the staffing capabilities. After the conversion, the urgent care unit will be staffed by one nurse for most of a shift, with a second nurse overlapping for three hours.
“We are concerned [as to] how one nurse could possibly handle the number of beds that they have if six people were to walk in all at once needing urgent care,” she says. “It’s the concern of nurses being left alone.”
If a critically ill patient sought care and the “outcome was not good,” there could be a lawsuit: Having fewer personnel increases the risk of error. “Nurses don’t want to put their license out there.”
Of the original staff of 12, only three nurses have opted to remain at the Somerville location. Valley-Shah herself has decided to leave.
Cecere wrote that because inpatient services were closed at Somerville Hospital in 2009, “there is no inpatient capacity that will be lost” when the hospital closes. The CHA website also states that Somerville residents’ rates of hospital admission have decreased by 26 percent, and that emergency care use is down 16 percent. The shift to urgent care, the website claims, meets the community’s changing needs.
Valley-Shah, however, believes declining usage rates are not reason enough to convert the facility. “I compare us to firefighters,” she says. “Firefighters don’t close fire stations because they don’t get a lot of calls for fires. They’re there in case there is a fire.”
Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked concerns about losing resources in a time when healthcare providers are becoming increasingly strained at their current capacities. Donna Kelly-Williams, MNA president and a registered nurse at Cambridge Hospital, worries that removing the emergency department as an option for Somerville residents may prove perilous for the community.
“When I testified at that [Department of Public Health] hearing, we were hearing rumblings of this pandemic coming our way,” she says. She advocates for “retrofitting” Somerville Hospital, rendering it adequately equipped to receive extra patients who may become ill due to COVID-19. “At the very least, it could be set up as a testing site to a bigger extent. So many opportunities are being lost as a result of moving forward with the closure.”
According to Cecere, “At this time [the CHA is] focusing on meeting the pressing healthcare needs presented by COVID-19. In fact, this situation shows how nimbly we can meet changing healthcare needs of our community. We plan to continue with our transition to an urgent care center at this location. The Somerville Hospital ED is a standalone site, located at a campus that does not include inpatient beds. Patients needing admission, particularly ones who are in respiratory distress, will need to be transferred to another hospital. Right now, we have staff at the Somerville ED overnight who are seeing very few patients. As we face a coming surge in COVID-19 patients, we could better serve the community by redeploying staff to our inpatient units to meet the needs from this pandemic.” Our Cambridge Hospital ED is located less than two miles away on the Cambridge/Somerville line. We are always evaluating our staffing needs and will adjust accordingly to deliver the right level of care.”
The MNA has sent a letter to Massachusetts governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 asking that “closures for all facilities or consolidations or conversions be halted,” according to Valley-Shah, who advocates for the postponement of the emergency department’s closure. While the majority of nurses at the Somerville emergency department have prepared for its closure by securing positions at other locations within or outside of the CHA, they have an agreement to stay until June 2, a month past the original closing date.
Ultimately, Kelly-Williams says she fears for the future of the community. “When we look back on this, I think that we’re all going to realize what a very dangerous decision it has been over the years to close the number of community services that we’ve seen across the Commonwealth.”

On the very first day of sophomore orientation, I sat happily in the dining hall, excited to be back at college with my friends. We were discussing our dream of starting a club for Irish students. One of my deans sat down next to me and asked what we were up to. I said, “We’re going to start an Irish club! A lot of us are Irish.” He looked at me, laughed, and said, “You’re about as Irish as I am! My name is Patrick, so you would think I’m Irish, but I’m not!”
I tried to explain to Patrick that my last name is literally McDougall, but he continued to talk over me, not seeming to understand. After he finished talking and walked away, the excitement that I had felt a minute before subsided, leaving a simmering discontent. I felt like this man had made an assumption and then refused to hear anything that contradicted it. I tried to move past this moment, but even months later my anger hasn’t quite dissipated. I still avoid Patrick in the dining hall.
My awareness of racially-charged situations like this has been slowly sharpening since I started college more than a year ago. . I’m not completely sure what about the college environment has led me to think about race. It could be the fact that I am around so many more people of color than I used to be. It could be that my own experiences have been validated — when you talk about race with people who have had similar experiences, you realize that it’s not just you, that it’s not just in your head.
I am white, black, and Asian. People have described my appearance as “ethnically ambiguous” — light brown skin, dark brown eyes, and wavy, brunette hair. I grew up with a white dad, a black and Asian mom, and a younger sister, who I suppose is the only person I know who is the same race as me. I have two white grandparents and two black grandparents — my mom’s biological Asian father was never really in the picture. I’m not one hundred percent sure what Asian country my family is from, and I don’t think I quite comprehended that I was Asian until late middle school. The different facets of my racial identity can be confusing to navigate, and I’ve found comfort in the idea that sometimes I don’t have to break myself down into fractions. Sometimes I can just be mixed and leave it at that.
***
These days, I think about race all the time — this is new for me. As a child I was one of the only kids of color who attended my public elementary school in Pennsylvania’s rural Amish country, but I remember feeling pretty comfortable. I spent my time playing with my two best friends, catching frogs in the pond, holding chicken weddings on the trampoline, and taking my sheep on walks. At the end of the day, I felt like any other little kid. Yet when I mentioned to my mom a few months ago that I didn’t seem to think about race that much as a child, her eyebrows scrunched in confusion.
She told me that from her perspective it seemed like I definitely thought about race. She described to me an afternoon when I came home from preschool. “I don't know why you said it,” she said. “Something must have happened to you or made you think of something. I don't know.” But I came home and told her that I wished her skin was lighter. I heard these words and my stomach clenched, and it became a little difficult to breathe for a second. I felt sad and ashamed and horrified that I had said this and didn’t even remember. And I thought about how my mom must have felt when I said that to her.
I wanted to see what my dad and sister remember about our interracial family growing up in rural Pennsylvania. When I talked to them, their perspectives were starkly different. My dad definitely didn’t think about or notice race as much as my mom did. He actually seemed to think about my childhood in much the same way I did for so long. He told me, “My recollection is you had this kind of really cool, idyllic, unspoiled country childhood.” Our conversation ended up being more about his own transformation — having women of color make up his immediate family forced him to grapple with issues he otherwise wouldn’t have.
It was my sister, however, who experienced life with me as a child herself. I wasn’t surprised to find that, like me, she doesn’t remember thinking too much about her race. However, it was clear that when she did, it was in a different context. She told me, “My skin color is not very dark, like I was the same skin color as everyone else, but probably for me it would be my hair.” Our awareness of our race was shaped by our “less white” features — my skin and her hair. She described how she would feel differently about her own hair if she saw other people with curly hair in her classes. She said, “I think that's why I wear my hair in a ponytail and stuff, because everyone else had straight hair. And in fourth grade a girl in my class had curly hair and I was like, ‘Oh, she has curly hair. I’m not the only one.’”
***
I still remember living life without race in the forefront of my mind, but as I think back, memories do seem to resurface. When I was in third grade, my guidance counselor had our class play a game. I don’t remember what the point of the game was exactly — I think they must have been trying to introduce the concept of diversity to us — but I know it required us to stand on one side of the room or the other depending on how we answered a series of questions. About halfway through the game the counselor said, “Stand on that side of the room if you are not white.” I stood alone in the middle of the room, completely frozen by indecision. I turned to the counselor and blurted out, “But I’m both!” She smiled at me, and told me to choose a side.
I remember feeling utterly lost in that moment. My memory tells me I followed the rest of my classmates to the “white” side of the room, because I’m half white. But then I remember standing there and feeling like I got the question wrong. Was I white? I didn’t know.
The classic mixed dilemma — to choose a side or check a box. The choice I was forced to make speaks to the way we see race in the U.S.: You’re white, or you’re not.
A 2005 study conducted by Erica Chito Childs, “Navigating Interracial Borders,” examines various aspects of the lives of black and white couples. The chapter titled “Multiracial Problems for Black and White Families” finds that much of the opposition to interracial relationships is expressed as concern for biracial children. The U.S. perception of race is built on the idea that racial groups are fundamentally different.“Biracial individuals are a threat to these racial boundaries and groupings,” Chito writes, “because their very existence undermines the assertion that race is a mutually exclusive grouping.”
Racial boxes are clearly drawn, and the expectation is that people fit neatly into them. But mixed kids fuck up the boxes. We prove they aren’t real.
In his autobiography, “Dreams from my Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance,” Barack Obama addresses and condemns the tendency of some mixed-race people to reject their non-whiteness: “The minority assimilated into the dominant culture, not the other way around.” He continues, claiming that, in America, white is the only “nonracial” race. “And we, the half-breeds and the college degreed, take a survey of the situation and think to ourselves, ‘Why should we get lumped in with the losers if we don’t have to?’” he writes.
Going to elementary school in rural Pennsylvania, I didn’t think about ideas like this. I was surrounded by white people, and because I was half white, most of the time I could assimilate to the people around me — the “nonracial.”
I’ve focused a lot on the ways in which my mixed identity has caused me confusion and hurt. But being mixed has also granted me a lot of privilege. Colorism — discrimination based on the shade of one’s skin — turns people’s prejudices in my favor. The problem that Obama brings up is one that I do consider now. I am not trying to equate my experiences with those of other people of color, or discount those experiences. But by identifying as a mixed person, am I practicing my own form of internalized racism?
I don’t intend to portray a picture of damage either. In her study on black and white couples, Childs expresses that interracial opposition seemed to invoke the “traditional image of ‘tragic mulattoes’ predisposed to emotional and psychological problems.” She continues, writing that “the concern for the children conjures up the image that these children will have to ‘pay’ for the parent’s actions, reminiscent of the biblical injunction that ‘the sins of the fathers will be visited on the sons.’”
I assure you, I do not consider myself a “tragic mulatto,” or feel like every day of life is a punishment for my parents’ sins. The irony is that I would be perfectly unperplexed by my racial identity if it weren’t for the perceptions of others. The existence of mixed people in itself is not an issue. We are not damaged, but we damage racial traditions.
Obama does go on to soften his words from above, recognizing his own insecurity in his critique of one of his mixed-race friends. He adds, “In their mannerisms, their speech, their mixed-up hearts, I kept recognizing pieces of myself. And that’s exactly what scared me. Their confusion made me question my own racial credentials all over again.”
***
That feeling of realizing “I’m not the only one” that my sister mentioned is a feeling I’ve come to know well since coming to college. I’m now in a much more diverse place than my home, and college has challenged me to explore issues of race.
We grow up in a world that tells us to identify ourselves and others as this or that. But when I try to identify myself as this or that, I get confused. The one-drop rule would say that any drop of “black blood” that I have makes me black. But I don’t look very black. How much of that identity should I claim when my experiences have been so different? I’m also Asian. However, I don’t feel very Asian — is that bad? Plus, I’m white. Maybe I can even “pass” as white, when people praise the “tan” skin that I still have in the winter. But when does this praise of light skin turn into a racial fetish? Maybe it’s when I’m called “exotic,” or when I hear people go on and on about how cute mixed babies are. I have a lot of privilege and a lot of confusion and a lot to think about all at once.
I’m perplexed, and perhaps I always will be. I’m going to keep growing up and my concept of my racial identity will keep changing. It’s malleable and nebulous because it’s not real. And yet, as my understanding of my race becomes more complex, it also solidifies. I’ve learned a new vocabulary to describe the things that I’ve felt and I’ve discovered nuances that fill in the cracks. Moving into a new environment has complicated my view of myself — but also clarified it.
My resident tutors have a mixed-race, four-year-old son. Recently, I was waiting for the very slow and rickety elevator with his mom, and she asked me if I could suggest some mixed role models to show him. I went back to my room and immediately started brainstorming. I’m pretty sure that their son, like me, will always be somewhat confused by his mixedness. But he’s living on an urban college campus, there is a mixed-race girl living down the hall from him, and he’s probably already steps ahead of me in his conception of race at age four. Maybe he’ll be able to say earlier in his life than I did, “I’m not the only one.”

Across the country, the COVID-19 pandemic and Trump Administration’s resultant travel restrictions have complicated the work of immigration-focused legal aid organizations. Some immigration courts have begun to conduct proceedings over video-conference systems, and others have closed altogether. At the same time, the Department of Justice has postponed all proceedings for non-detained people until May 1. 
For 30 years, the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, a program administered by the Law School, has represented asylum-seekers and those at risk of deportation. Fifteen Minutes spoke with the clinic’s director, Sabrineh Ardalan, to discuss the impact of the recent changes on their clients. This interview has been edited slightly for clarity and concision.
FM: How would you characterize the work of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, and which communities does the clinic primarily serve?
Sabrineh Ardalan: We represent people who are seeking asylum and other forms of humanitarian protection. Our clients come from all over the world. In recent years, we’ve had a lot of folks from Central America, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East.
FM: Is there any particular way that the University’s decision to evacuate campus affected your clients?
SA: Through Zoom and Skype, we’ve been able to continue holding meetings with clients and teaching classes. Our work certainly hasn’t stopped. The immigration court filing deadlines are still in motion — in fact, detained cases are still moving forward and the federal courts are open for immigration appeals. We have no choice but to keep pressing forward.
In addition to the technological hurdles, we’re doing everything we can to get folks who are detained released from detention so long as they are not flight risks or a danger in their communities. We’ve written several letters to local ICE officials and are working with clinics across the country to advocate to the Executive Office of Immigration Review [the administrative body of immigration courts]. A lawsuit was also just filed to try to temporarily close the immigration courts. We’re not only focused on our clients but are trying to create policy changes that protect people’s lives and safety.
FM: What would you say your clients are experiencing at this moment?
SA: I certainly can’t speak for my clients — everyone’s experiencing things in different ways. I think some are worried about the health and safety of their families. Some clients work at jobs that put them at risk or no longer have jobs. They’re worried about how they’re going to pay rent. Other clients in detention fear the virus will spread quickly in detention facilities because people are in such close quarters. Everyone’s working with fear and uncertainty.
FM: As you mentioned, court proceedings for detained immigrants remain ongoing. What are they like in Boston?
SA: I haven’t had a hearing in Boston in the past couple of weeks, but I know lawyers are allowed to appear telephonically, and detainees are appearing over video conferences. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, some people are still going to court in person and are told to supply their own protective gear.
FM: How has the temporary delay on the cases for non-detained people impacted the clinic’s cases?
SA: Sometimes people may benefit from the opportunity to collect more information and prepare for their cases. A lot of the time, though, people have been waiting years to have their cases heard; they’ve prepared extensively. Rescheduling has left them in limbo. A number of cases the clinic is working on were supposed to have hearings this semester. Now they’re put off, and we don’t know when they will be rescheduled. There’s a back-log of over a million cases in the immigration court system right now.
FM: The Trump administration has announced plans to ban people from seeking asylum. What do you make of this response?
SA: Beyond the due process concerns, efforts to ban people from seeking asylum because of the virus directly contravene our obligations in both domestic and international law. The U.S., bound by the Refugee Convention Protocol of 1967, has an obligation to protect people who have a well-founded reason not to return to their home countries. You can’t deny people the protections they deserve, even in times of crisis.
FM: Has the clinic taken on particular advocacy positions in relation to the pandemic?
SA: We’ve written several letters asking ICE officials to release people from detention, asking the immigration courts to take action to do the same, and asking the government to protect people’s health and safety. My hope is that litigation and individual cases will help change the system.
As of mid-March, the ACLU began filing suits against the federal government to release detainees due to concerns over the health of medically-vulnerable people in detention conditions. At the end of the month, the Southern Poverty Law Center joined with the ACLU of Louisiana to seek the immediate release of asylum seekers in Louisiana detention centers. Cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Arizona, Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana detention centers.

It’s about 6:30 p.m. on a Sunday. I’m standing on my porch watching the sun set, eating a family-sized bag of Lay’s chips. I realize that per Ward-household-quarantine-protocol, since I put my whole hand in the chip bag, the rest of the Lay’s are now mine. This is to be the biggest triumph of my day.
I spent today, as I have spent every other day since coming home, half-heartedly trying to do my schoolwork while listening to hours of podcasts. I have distracted myself by going through old family photo books with my dad and trying to guess which family members are which. Like the rest of the United States, I watched all of “Tiger King” in 48 hours.
Scattered amongst the never-ending stream of tweets about Joe Exotic — the Tiger King, for those who may not know — I see a flurry of tweets from Jason Furman ’92. Furman is one of my Economics professors and a former Obama administration big shot. His latest claim to fame is writing the op-ed that became the foundation for one of the biggest stimulus bills in U.S. history — in an hour, from his couch.
Furman followed the article with a storm of tweets about what he sees as the best direction for U.S. policy to take over the coming months. This morning, I tweeted a conspiracy theory about the “Air Bud” series.

My mother returns from work early on a Monday afternoon. She gets out of her car, leaves her stethoscope and house call equipment in a trash bag in the garage, and carefully hangs her lab coat by the door. She sits at her makeshift desk and begins to type notes on the patients she saw today — the exhaustion is evident in her face, her posture, her voice.
For me, one of the most unsettling parts about this pandemic is the feeling of powerlessness. I can’t leave my home, visit friends or family, or even see the virus that is causing this crisis. This feeling is made worse by watching my mother, a geriatric nurse practitioner, do her best to continue to care for her elderly patients and calm her panicked colleagues. At dinner, in a tired voice, she tells me several of her coworkers are thinking of leaving medicine once the crisis is over. I try to not think about what would happen if my mother contracted the virus. She is 60 and has asthma. Everything I can think to do in the face of these circumstances seems tiny and wholly inconsequential.
My mother is worried that as the crisis worsens, she may be drafted to the front lines. I imagine her donning layers of protective gear as she prepares to treat her patients: a gown, gloves, two masks. Given her frequent conversations over the phone about the dwindling stock of protective equipment in the area, this image is becoming increasingly implausible. I imagine droves of neighbors coming to my mother’s aid to deliver boxes of surgical gloves, like some dystopian reenactment of “Dunkirk.”
Recently, my mother got an email notifying her that, regardless of their specialty, doctors and nurses may be reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. She tells me her biggest fear is being sent to triage patients. Under normal circumstances, triage entails classifying patients by the severity of their condition. In these circumstances, triage is a much grimmer task. Whoever is running triage will be responsible for making life and death decisions. This responsibility weighs particularly heavily on my mother, who is devoutly religious. She entered the field to heal the sick and, above all, “to do no harm.” In this situation, she would be put in the unimaginable position of deciding which of her patients are most worthy of receiving life-saving care.
***
I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to best comfort my mother. I don’t know how to best help the people around me. I don’t know how to best help my friends. I don’t even know how to muster the right amount of empathy for people living next door, let alone people across the country or across oceans.
This isolation from my community, my family, my world writ large, makes it so much harder to contextualize the global suffering COVID-19 has caused. I often like to spend large chunks of my days feeling sorry for myself and missing the community I left on campus. Being shuttered away from the world allows me to amplify my sense of self-pity until it feels bigger and more important than the incomprehensible death tolls and suffering I hear about on the news. How can that pain be real when the only world I know is my bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen?
I am deeply uncomfortable with all this not knowing. I’m almost done with my bag of Lay’s. My mind is racing but struggling to find traction, so I am left to pace inside my bedroom and wonder why the kids down the street are outside with their friends all the damn time and not locked inside like the rest of us. I suppose the one thing I do have going for me is that I have all the time in the world to figure it out.

It all started early Tuesday morning, when Rakesh emailed us to, well, get the fuck out. After a stream of notifications informing all of Harvard College that classes would be moving online after spring break and that we would have to “de-densify” campus by the end of the week, reality began to sink in: My Mom would be my new proctor.
Many would think that, as freshmen, moving back in with our parents would not be that big of a deal, given that we have only been in college for six months. They are wrong. There are a few things at school we have become accustomed to: the ability to walk into a dining hall and act like you do not recognize anyone; to view a new page of the Gutenberg Bible every day; to not hear your proctor have sex with your dad. This is, quite simply, no longer our reality.
Tuesday, 9:06 a.m.:
I roll out of bed and walk downstairs to the dining hall. I step out of the pantry after searching for Marshmallow Mateys, to no avail, and find myself pantless, making full eye contact with the Amazon delivery driver. He is dropping off four gallons of boom-boom sauce to supplement my eatery’s seasoning options. I am in the middle of asking my younger brother to pretend to swipe me into the kitchen when my mom appears. Back at school, I can pop in my air pods so that when my proctor waves to me I can ignore them guilt free. I am not afforded this luxury at home.
The first thing she goes after is my lack of pants. Apparently, the kitchen is a family space now — bullshit.
Tuesday, 12:15 p.m.:
I text my mom my grille order. She tells me I can make it my damn self.
Wednesday, 10:47 p.m.:
My mom walks in just as I start to mix my Powerade with the Rubinoff I stole from the local 7/11. She is not amused. Unlike in my freshman dorm, where my proctor made a show of making me pour my Black Cherry White Claws and Prison Pruno down the drain of the communal bathroom sinks, my mom takes a different approach. She takes it and gets drunk with my dad downstairs; they loudly dance to “Dirty Work” by Steely Dan.
Thursday, 11:17 p.m.
As I wrap up my studying for the Ec10b-participation-trophy-we-know-this-sucks-too-final, I strip down and prepare to participate in the age-old Harvard tradition of Primal Scream. My blockmates are on a Zoom call, all fully naked. I’m running late, so I grab the family iPad, join the call, and head out in the empty cul-de-sac.
I’m standing there in the cul-de-sac — left hand on my privates, right hand gripping the family 16-inch iPad — as the Powerade and Rubinoff begins to pump through my veins and the anticipation on the Zoom call increases. Just then, the porchlights flicker on and light floods the cul-de-sac, revealing my rear end and my mother’s disapproving gaze. She honestly doesn’t even care that I’m naked, she just wants the iPad back so she can watch “Big Little Lies.”
Friday, 3:32 p.m.:
I am working on my rendition of “10,000 Men of Harvard” on my third-grade recorder. My mom busts into my single and tells me to “shut the fuck up; I’m on a conference call.” I check the clock and resume playing — quiet hours don’t start until 2 a.m. on Fridays.
Saturday, 10:06 a.m.:
Just wrapped up watching the throuple wedding on “Tiger King” with the roommates. Needless to say, I’m in my feels. I begin to break down, my walls begin to crumble, and tears stream down my cheeks like dew on a spring morning. I feel like I am being torn apart like the keeper on “Tiger King” was when the tiger ripped his arm off, but, like, emotionally.
Mother comes over to comfort me. At this moment I can only revel in the sweet memory of audibly breaking down on the third floor of Lamont where people knew how to mind their damn business.

Only in gay porn might acne make you more attractive. It’s part and parcel of a look. A flat and hairless stomach, short and spiky haircut, toothy smile, maybe a pubey mustache, but never armpit hair. Skin super pale or spray-tanned orange. Hair brunette or dyed yellowish blonde. There usually aren’t any clothes — this is, after all, porn. If there are clothes, though, it’s usually a shirt just small enough that, when the arms are lifted, a small but exciting amount of midriff is revealed and some relaxed-fit jeans with holes around the knee and down by the cuff. In the beginning, there is underwear. Skimpy briefs, the type you could rip open if you wanted to, and this look — this tiny and taut body, this skinny, cheap twink — invites you to do as much.
Can you see this body yet? It’s the body of the gay porn actors who bottom. They’re penetrated, they receive, they take it. These porn actors are type-cast: You look like a bottom;therefore, you are a bottom. Porn is nothing if not essentializing. In most scenes, these actors are merely the sexually submissive partner. In other scenes, though, scenes which script out and eroticize sexual violence, these actors are cast as victim.
Johnny Rapid is one of these porn actors. With all the evident primping and pampering of Rapid’s face and body you might wonder: Why all the pimples? Surely, there’s something he can do about those suckers. But the pimples, more than anything else, are what make Johnny Rapid, now 27, resemble the 18-year-old virgin he was presented as when he started acting in pornography. Why, then, would he get rid of the pimples? What, after all, does society sexualize more than the innocent?
***
At 27, Rapid has filmed over 240 sex scenes. In 2017, he was one of the most widely searched actors on Pornhub, and in 2014 he won the Cybersocket Web Award for Best International Porn Star.
This continued success has been due, in no small part, to the fact that Rapid — at 5’6” and 134 pounds — still looks like a twink. In porn, the diminutive bodies of twinks are figured as vulnerable. In scene after scene, Rapid bottoms and plays a younger man forced or coerced into sex by an older man. His body is vulnerable-looking, and in porn, this perceived physical vulnerability is taken advantage of, manhandled. Rapid, by being the manhandled and not the manhandler, represents innocence. Innocence isn’t about acting, it’s about being acted upon.
In “Prison Shower,” Johnny Rapid, then 19, plays an inmate raped by a larger and older one, played by Rafael Alencar, 31 at the time. In a recent interview, Rapid looked back at this scene — one of his most graphic, transforming the reality of molestations in prison into an erotic fantasy — as the major turning-point in his career.
“My scene with Rafael Alencar, ‘Prison Shower,’ was iconic. It will never be forgotten,” he says. “It was hard to get into that mindset, but I did it. I went somewhere. I really did. I put myself in a girl’s shoes if she was in that situation. And it worked.”
For Rapid, putting on your girl’s shoes is about becoming passive, becoming the object of violent acts. Putting on your girl’s shoes is about inhabiting innocence, innocence here both begetting violence and being violence’s opposite.
***
On Oct. 9, 2014, Rapid assaulted his wife after she refused to have a threesome with him and a 14-year-old girl. He was arrested two months later. In an interview from the year before, Rapid said, “I’m really dominant over females... I do my porn, and then I go home to my girlfriend. I have sex with her until she bleeds.” At work, Rapid puts on a pair of girl’s shoes. At the end of the day, he goes home to his wife and puts on his big boy shoes.
When gay media outlets picked up the story of the arrest, Rapid responded on Twitter in January of 2015 with a selfie of him and his wife, captioned, “The media can write and twist the story all they want. Just know we still stand strong.”
Later that day, in response to several stories claiming that Rapid was straight, he tweeted, “I guess being BISEXUAL is still considered being straight.” This announcement came after five years of telling the public he was straight and merely a “gay-for-pay” porn actor.
The timing of Rapid’s invocation of BGLTQ identity eerily parallels Kevin Spacey’s infamous 2017 tweet in which he responded to allegations that he had sexually assaulted a 14-year-old boy by coming out as gay. “I choose now to live as a gay man,” Spacey tweeted just hours after Buzzfeed published the first allegations against him. “I want to deal with this honestly and openly,” he wrote, “and that starts with examining my own behavior.”
People were enraged at Spacey’s tweet for reinscribing the conflation of homosexuality with pedophilia. They were also upset that Spacey was trying to muffle a story of sexual assault with a coming out story.
What’s happening in Spacey’s and Rapid’s tweets, though, isn’t muffling, but a manipulation of gay/bi identity. Each man implies not necessarily that he is innocent of the crime alleged against him, but that he is innocent in a larger and more elusive sense of the word, one beyond a bureaucratic notion of justice. Unconsciously represented in their statements is the image of gay/bi men as the manhandled, but never the manhandler. Rapid and Spacey disrupt their figuration as predators with the potential that, via their sexuality, they could be victims.
Gay/bi identity is vulnerable, placed in the margins of society, and also implies that a man could be vulnerable in sexual and domestic contexts. Such an identity, as invoked by Spacey and Rapid, doesn’t absolve either one of guilt but claims that one, made oh-so-vulnerable by their identity, couldn’t possibly have accrued enough power to be dangerous in the first place. How could the abused possibly abuse?
In the case of Rapid’s tweet, the image unconsciously registered is a preexisting one: the images of sexual violence that have already been enacted upon his body in porn. Rapid, by coming out at the moment he did, implied a link between his pornographic work and his domestic life. Coming out as bisexual perhaps would add authenticity to the images we had seen of him pretending to be abused while also invalidating allegations that he had been an abuser. “Look,” he seemed to imply, “that was the real me in those videos. That innocent-looking twink couldn’t possibly hurt anyone.”
A few months after the first allegations about Spacey came out, Heather Unruh, a former TV anchor, came forward with more allegations. She stated that Spacey sexually assaulted her son, who was just 18 years old at the time. “My son was a starstruck, straight, 18-year-old young man who had no idea that the famous actor was an alleged sexual predator,” Unruh said.
Unruh says “straight” with particular emphasis. If Spacey and Rapid’s invocation of gay/bi sexuality implies that this sexuality begets victimization, Unruh’s statement seems to go even further: Gay/bi sexuality invites victimization. If her son had been gay the assault may have been deserved, may have even been besired. The violation would have been less violating, the tragedy less tragic.

Shoes can be taken on and off. The body, however, remains.
It isn’t, of course, Rapid’s bisexuality that facilitates his transition from abusive husband in real life to abused gay boy in front of the pornographer’s camera. It is his body that facilitates this transition. It is his body that performs in pornography, being dominated and penetrated, and it is his body that inflicted acts of violence on his wife. Despite what Rapid and Spacey seem to want us to believe, it’s entirely possible to be both abused and abuser.
Porn is, obviously, not reality. But it also isn’t total fantasy.
Porn is more like a revolving door. It allows bodies to move from one space to another, while serving as an airlock, ensuring that either side of the revolving door remains its own environment governed by its own rules. Bodies on either side can be cast into roles. If you look like Rapid — thin, short, hairless, pimpled — you can guess what role you might be assigned. Meanings can be poured into these bodies, and values can be attached. Rapid can enter this revolving door as an abuser, and come out the other side as the abused. Shoes are swappable.

It’s a beautiful day at Harvard. The sun is out, filtering through the trees and lighting up the green yard surrounding you. Widener Library towers above as tourists snap photos of the surrounding scenery. Your guide, McKenna, explains the three lies of the John Harvard Statue and welcomes questions from the group. Before she can explain, you’re moving on, clicking the white arrow on your computer screen to see the next photo.
This is your first impression of Harvard’s campus, and it’s a virtual tour.
For the admitted students of the class of 2024, a virtual tour is now one of the only ways to learn more information about Harvard. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all universities have cancelled welcome weekends and sent current students home to complete the semester online. Following the release of many college decisions in late March, students who were hoping for on-campus experiences now need to find alternative ways to inform their final decisions.
Jasmine M. Green, a student admitted to Harvard’s class of 2024, says the cancellation of welcome weekends means making a decision is more difficult. “For me, when I go to college campuses, I have a gut feeling [about the school],” she explains. “I really wanted to go to Harvard and get the feel of the campus and compare that to the other schools, but now I can’t go and see any of them. So I have to get that feeling somewhere else, virtually, and it’s obviously not going to be as strong.”
Even students who have been to Harvard before say the experience of a campus changes after being admitted. “There’s a lot of schools that I applied to that I didn’t want to get emotionally invested in until I got in,” explains Rothsaida Sylvaince, another admitted student. “So I feel like there is a lot left to be desired.”
The “gut feeling” that Green describes is often helpful for students who find it difficult to distinguish schools that are similar academically. But without the ability to experience campus, the class of 2024 must now make a decision based predominantly on online resources, of which some students are wary because they are provided by colleges themselves.
Mira S. Becker, a student deciding between Brown and Harvard, says “the problem with virtual stuff is that neither college is going to showcase a student who doesn’t love the college, so it feels very biased.” As a result, colleges have organized GroupMes, Facebook pages, and Zoom meetings to connect admitted students to each other, and many admits rely on current students to relay a fuller image of campus life.
Beejay E. Odufuwa, an admitted student, says he “cold DMs” current students to get a better understanding of what schools are like. “They have the school in their bio, so I’ll just try to DM them,” he says. “I want to hear the good and the bad. And that’s one way I get a feel for the school because they’re obviously pretty honest.”
While factors such as financial aid, location, academics, and extracurriculars always play a significant role, many students ultimately rely on the feel and culture of campus to help make their final decision. Though colleges are doing what they can, capturing a campus’s atmosphere digitally is difficult, especially under such short notice.
“I feel like it’s very hard to calculate the culture of the school within a virtual tour,” Sylvaince says. “I feel like I’m just looking at architecture.”
Without a campus visit, a college might initially seem like a good option. When Green visited a school that was originally one of her top choices, she says she realized the “disconnect” between her perception of the school and its reality. “But on paper, I loved everything about it,” she says. “I’m scared of making [a] decision because there are schools that I have not seen in person, and I won’t be able to see before May 1st.”
And for some students in the class of 2024, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new criteria in how they evaluate colleges.
“How the college campuses have responded to the pandemic that’s going on [impacts my decision], just to see how they treat and how they care for their students,” Olusola A. Babalola explains.
Green, who is still deciding between five colleges, is also taking university responses into account. “Even in an emergency situation, I want to see how schools had a support system to handle that,” she says. “I think every school is trying their best to deal with it or have dealt with it the best way they could, but I think initially some schools handled it better than others.”
Though many admitted students are disappointed, they also say they recognize the severity of the situation and know that careful deliberation led to these cancellations.
“[Welcome weekends] were definitely going to be an important factor in making [my college] decision, but of course, I’m not going to be upset about it. It’s not within Harvard’s or any of the other school’s control, so I can’t blame anybody,” says Brandon J. Demkowicz. “I do believe that they’re doing the most they can be doing.”
Committing to a college is meant to be a relief, a culmination of years of hard work and focus. But for Babalola, that relief will be harder-won than she had anticipated. “The college admissions process is very long, and throughout, I did a lot to ensure that I wouldn’t have any regrets,” she says. “I thought I would be able to go to these weekends and visit and have these things to help me make a decision, but now I don’t have that guidance to help me. It’s like I’m back at the beginning of the process.”

I didn’t realize just how seriously my parents would take the quarantine.
In hindsight, that was pretty foolish of me. Whenever I’m sick, they demand that I eat raw ginger or garlic and drink cup after cup of hot water. My dad is a physician and my mom used to work as a nurse, but their consistent enthusiasm for home remedies still surprises me.
No matter what the season, if I’m caught wearing short sleeves in my room, I’m bound to get reprimanded. In the summertime, donning a sweater is supposed to prevent the cold I might get from the air conditioning. I dread admitting a sore throat or runny nose to my mom; all I can expect is a glare, a mug of hot water, and a reminder that it’s because “你没穿好衣服” — you didn’t wear warm enough clothing.
After Harvard’s announcement that we had to leave campus for the rest of the semester, my parents drove 12 hours from Ohio to Boston so that I could avoid going through the crowded airport. They were exhausted when they finally arrived to pick me up. I started to take a step toward them — maybe for a hug, maybe just to help take their coats. But I stopped when I realized my movement wasn’t reciprocated. There it was: the six feet of space between us that our two months of separation wouldn’t bridge.
We had plans to leave the next morning, and I asked if I could come into my parents’ room to say good night. My mother, less worried, invited me in. My dad, who has asthma, took a couple steps back.
The next morning, after loading my suitcases into the trunk of my parents’ car and climbing into the cramped backseat, my dad’s first words were, “Where are the face masks?” I rolled my eyes and dug through his backpack, finally extracting a Ziploc bag with five or six surgical masks inside.
I strapped the mask to my face, molding the aluminum wire over the flat bridge of my nose. I leaned back, ready to sleep through as much of the 12-hour ride as I could. But before I closed my eyes, my dad’s voice cut through the air — “Wear the gloves too!”
***
The best word I can use for my quarantine is bizarre. For two weeks, my mom delivered my meals to me on a tray. After she left, I could emerge to grab the food before slinking back into my room. If I ever left my room (which was rare), I had to wear a face mask.
My dad was even more careful. He quarantined himself in the basement, only emerging for meals and to occasionally walk outside. My family split ourselves between the floors of our house — my dad in the basement, my mom on the ground floor, and me huddled in my bedroom in the corner of the second floor. At one point, I didn’t see my dad for two full days.
I didn’t realize that my situation could be considered unusual until I explained my house’s setup to a friend. He laughed and compared my dad to Oh Geun-sae, the husband of the housekeeper in “Parasite.” Maybe it wouldn’t have been so surprising if the lights suddenly started flashing messages in Morse Code.
My ventures outside were few and far between. Occasionally over the first week, one of my parents would agree to walk with me briefly, and I would get to trail six feet behind them on the sidewalk, mask and gloves on as usual. But after about a week, my chances to soak in my daily dose of vitamin D got even slimmer — my dad asked that I stay inside as the pandemic grew more severe nationwide.
Eventually, I was allowed back downstairs to use my usual desk for schoolwork, but I had to wipe down every surface I touched before heading back to my room.
One afternoon, my mom colluded with me so that I could sneak outside without my dad’s knowledge. I dashed around the block twice and headed home. When I returned to our front door, panting, I saw my mom standing with her finger to her lips. She pointed to her left, and I realized that my dad had migrated to the room right next to the front door.
I held my breath, slipped off my shoes, and tiptoed back upstairs before allowing myself to catch my breath.
***
Even now, a week after my 14-day quarantine has ended, parts of my life remain on hold. Though I can move freely between the floors of my house, I haven’t been able to unpack my things from school; last week, I found my suitcases lined up in the garage basking in the sunlight. When I asked my mom why, she answered half-jokingly, “to disinfect them.”
The other day, I went to stand on our back porch to enjoy the unusually warm afternoon sun. When I notified my dad of my plan, his head jerked up: “Are you going to wear a mask?”
I’ve realized that I’m not the only one experiencing added layers of precaution at home. One friend’s parents installed a UV light in their laundry room to disinfect coats; anytime someone comes home after going out, they place their coat in the laundry room to allow the light to work its magic.
My other friend was also quarantined from her family for a full two weeks. A week and a half into her sentence, she texted me: “Today [it] was raining and I wanted to get fresh air so I just stuck my head outside my bedroom window.”
I understand why my parents enforced my quarantine. If anything, I felt guilty for the extra strain I caused. I felt like I was introducing anxiety that wasn’t present before — there’s no telling what I could have picked up at school, especially since plenty of cases have been asymptomatic.
For those first two uncertain weeks, I’m sure that my dad, a member of a higher-risk population, was even more on edge than he is now. During dinner earlier this week, he offered me one of the four raw garlic cloves he was munching on. I declined his offer.
While my parents’ tactics have added some inconvenience to my day-to-day life, it’s hard to know whether or not they’re going overboard. I’m not sure how much the sun baths for my luggage or the respiratory protection from my backyard have supplemented the social distancing recommendations from public health officials. But the three of us are healthy and safe right now, so I guess it doesn’t really matter.

I’ve always been vaguely aware that my mom is an infectious disease doctor. There were little clues — medical jargon over dinner, horror stories about patients used to scare me into healthy eating, a skin rash-themed wall calendar — but on the whole, I simply thought of her as my mom, and beyond that, just perpetually busy.
Now, though, her profession is not just unignorable — it’s inseparable from her identity as my mom, from her very existence.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve seen the pandemic up close. I’ve seen my mother become increasingly concerned, stressed, and distant, both physically and emotionally. I’m scared.
Family dinners have migrated from the dining room to the living room. We move food from plate to mouth without looking, eyes fixed on the latest dire statistic. My mom sits in her chair to the side, blue light carving the bags under her eyes deeper.
Dinnertime is my daily news briefing. PBS provides the worldwide numbers, my mom provides the local situation. I listen, but the conversation is mostly between her and my dad, also a doctor, and the two of them speak a lexicon I can only partially understand.
N-95 — the regulation face mask all healthcare workers are supposed to wear at the hospital. Intubated — to be put on a ventilator, or more graphically, to have a plastic tube inserted into your trachea to deliver oxygen to your heart because your body can’t do it itself. Nosocomial — of an infection, to be transmitted within the hospital.
One night, my mom and I work on a Mozart piano duet. She plays primo, the treble, and I secondo, the bass. It’s been a while since we’ve done this, not since I was home for Christmas. I’m reminded of many elementary and middle school evenings spent practicing under my mother’s watchful eye, how she taught me discipline. Now, both sight-reading, we play together, apologizing and laughing when we miss a note, bumping elbows on the narrow bench.
She coughs. It’s a dry cough that cuts off the music, not just because she jerks her arms up to cover her mouth, but also because my whole body instinctively tenses at the noise. She shakes her head as if coming out of a dream, heads back to the kitchen, and leaves the piece half-finished. “We’re too close. It’s making me nervous.”
It makes me nervous, too, and sad. Lately, by necessity, my mom has felt less like my mom, more like a doctor. As the death toll rises in our state, as patients die and colleagues fall ill, she’s only become busier and more stressed. I see her only at night, when she returns from work, late, with a heaviness about her.
On weekends, when I sleep late and stretch in the sunlight, I hear my mom hurry up the attic stairs, ready to lead the daily command control Zoom meeting.
Our daily lives couldn’t be more different. I go through hours in a luxurious daze, half-present in online classes, baking sourdough, as if there’s no world beyond my front door. Meanwhile, my mom is swept up in the defining crisis of her professional career. I’ve never felt so distant from her.
One Friday, I drive up to visit my boyfriend. The weather is mockingly picturesque, all blue skies and seagulls. As I approach him, he extends his hand in a faux stop sign — as if to say: “stay six feet away!”— but then he puts down his hand and pulls me into a hug. I realize it’s been weeks since I’ve felt close physical contact.
The day is almost perfect, a sort of pre-pandemic anachronism. But as I shake sand out of my shoes and drive home, I feel a pang of guilt. My mom can’t indulge in an escape, can’t forget her role in this crisis for a second — and neither should I. Because I haven’t escaped anything, really — I’m already inextricably connected to my mom, and she to her patients and colleagues. Paradoxically, it’s because of this interconnectedness that we’ve been called to distance. When I arrive home, my mom forbids me from visiting the following week.
In the eyes of others, the connection is obvious: I’ve always been inextricably linked to my mother, now more than ever — a veritable pastor’s son of the times. I’m a conduit, both of information and of disease. “What does your mom think?” “Can my dad call your mom?” “Well, is your mom worried?” I’m spammed with requests for information from frantic group chats and concerned friends, looking for a way into this pandemic, at once ubiquitous and yet, for most, oddly far away, in news broadcasts and headlines and anecdotes. “You must have such an interesting perspective,” they say, almost enviously.
They clamor to hear my interesting perspective, or to hear from my mother directly — but only over the phone, through text, via email. I go for a run with my high school friend, taking care to stay six feet apart. Usually we stretch inside her house afterwards, but this time she says goodbye outside, hand firmly on the doorknob. “I’m sorry. My parents are nervous. You understand.”
I tell my mom about this phenomenon and she laughs, bitterly. “We’re lepers,” she says.
It’s another tragic paradox of this pandemic — healers are even more vulnerable to falling ill. Hospitals, places of recovery, can become breeding grounds for disease. Already, at my local hospital, there have been three confirmed cases among health care workers.
It’s remarkable how quickly this practice of distancing, in its physical and emotional forms, has permeated and shaped interactions, outside the house and inside. Just a couple weeks ago, my mom ate at the dinner table, sat close by on the couch, and played piano accompaniment while I sang over her shoulder. She could cleanly separate work from home — the world of white coats and patient charts from the warmth of a home-cooked meal and the touch of family. Now she doesn’t have that luxury.
At first, my parents’ discussions about the virus were charged with a perverse academic intrigue. My dad would compare the pandemic to Albert Camus’s “The Plague,” or speculate about its long-term economic impacts. My mom would talk about its epidemiological curve and transmission rate almost like a real-life word problem: If the average COVID patient infects three others, how long will it take for America’s hospital system to be overwhelmed? Justify your answer.
This academic perspective arose from another paradox: Although my parents, and especially my mom, are particularly vulnerable to the virus as doctors, they also occupy a position of privilege. They have reliable jobs, health insurance, a home to return to; they can predict the academic literature on the crisis because their socioeconomic status means they can picture stable life after the pandemic.
This post-pandemic stability is likely for our family, but not guaranteed.
These days, I brush past my mom on the stairs and hear a sharp intake of breath. I’m reminded of when I first got my driver’s permit, how she would sit in the passenger seat, white-knuckled and stiff, gasping with every lane change. A bit melodramatic, I think instinctively.
But then I remember this transmission thing works both ways: She could pick up the virus at the hospital and bring it home, but I could also infect her, and through her, jeopardize patients and other doctors. I skim the New York Times obituary page and ages of the deceased jump out at me: 75, 85, 67, 60. My mom, strong as she is, is over 60, and I can’t help but worry.
When I hear the low murmur of her 2005 Honda coming up the driveway, heels clicking to the back door, key turning in the lock — I can imagine for a second everything is normal. But I know it’s different when she takes off her shoes, sets her coat on the rack, and sits down to dinner without a word. Her end-of-the-day fatigue, always present but usually mixed with relief, now looks more like weariness. Or sometimes the purr of her car will stop in the garage, but the heel clicks don’t start for five or ten minutes. I imagine her alone in the driver’s seat with the lights out, listening to the latest figures on NPR with clenched teeth, or perhaps just sitting in the only space truly her own, in a sort of resigned reverie.
There’s little reverie to be had at home anymore. Home is no longer a safe haven from the stresses of work; the virus knows no bounds, and the home is just another possible site of contamination.
My mom’s command control meetings are all about preparedness — making beds available for the predicted influx, organizing clinical trials, ordering protective gear. But the virus is already here. In the hospital, the number of cases is accelerating. Even if my mom hasn’t brought the virus home, it’s already had a profound effect on the family.
Everything revolves around COVID. The news, the daily paper, dinner conversations. Even the small moments of joy.
We receive a package from my aunt. My mom sits on the kitchen floor in her slippers, awash in a sea of cardboard and tissue paper, like a kid on christmas morning. One by one she pulls out the gifts: Lysol wipes, face masks, Costco-sized hand sanitizer, and a box of caramel cookies. I see her weariness lift for a second: She can feel the love of family, even over a distance.
Another day, my mom calls me up to her study, smiling for the first time in days. She’s buying new scrubs and wants my advice: Should she buy aubergine or pewter, modern or classic fit? I advise her from across the room as she browses Amazon with outsized glee. In normal years, we go consignment store shopping every spring, our annual mother-daughter tradition. With a small leap of the imagination, scrub shopping is this year’s iteration. The future is uncertain, and likely dark, but we hold tight to normalcy.

Issam Elrhanifi stood in the quiet Quincy dining hall, staring down at the sheet in his hands.
It was the week of March 29. For the past seven days Elrhanifi had been working as usual, circumstances he hoped would change. The COVID-19 pandemic had changed his family situation drastically. Elrhanifi could not continue to work as Harvard had expected him to.
That day, Elrhanifi went to his manager at Quincy to inform him that he planned to stay home. Given the turbulence wrought by the pandemic, and Harvard’s recent agreement to continue paying employees at dining halls which had closed through May, Elrhanifi said he was optimistic. He hoped that once he explained his family circumstances, his manager would understand and they could come to a solution together. Instead, Elrhanifi received a sheet of paper.
The paper outlined Harvard’s policy for emergency time off during the pandemic. It informed Elrhanifi that in order to sustain pay, he would have to spend his remaining sick days and vacation time.
As he held the sheet in his hands, Elrhanifi realized what Harvard’s policy would mean for him.
Elrhanifi had no sick days left. He had used the last of his vacation time during spring break. He would enter “sick leave debt” on the following work day. In 14 days, Harvard would stop paying him.
Two weeks earlier, on the morning of March 10, Harvard students were told to leave campus. HUDS employees received a different message.
“You should expect to report to work as normal unless told otherwise by your manager following spring break.”
Elrhanifi’s childrens’ school closed the week of March 15; Quincy Dining Hall remained open. While College students left campus in droves, Elrhanifi was expected back at Quincy. With both parents at work, who was to take care of their two young daughters? Because of the pandemic, daycare and babysitters were not an option. The family decided Mr. Elrhanifi had no choice but to stay home.
The following week was spring break. Though Quincy remained open, Elrhanifi used his annually allotted vacation time to stay home as planned. Had he known about the policies Harvard would soon institute, perhaps he would have made a different choice. But Elhranifi had no way of knowing just how valuable his vacation days would soon become.
The one sided print-out he received would soon become Harvard’s staple response to requests for time off at the Harvard dining halls and among custodial workers.
The letter begins, “You have indicated that you either have an underlying health risk or are concerned that you are exposing at risk dependents if you continue to work.”
It goes on to lay out “the University’s enhanced workplace policies”: To receive payment, those who choose to stay home can first use any remaining sick time. The “negative sick leave” policy allows employees to use up to 14 unearned sick days, which will be deducted from final paychecks should the employees not be able to “rebuild their accrued sick time.” If employees choose not to enter into this debt, or should they exhaust the allotted sick days, they can use remaining vacation days to keep getting paid.
Elrhanifi had already used his allotted number of sick days for the year and spent his final vacation time on spring break. All that stood between Elrhanifi and unpaid leave was two weeks of borrowed time.
When Harvard sent its students home, by and large, life on campus ground to a halt. But a few students remain — as well as the essential workers needed to support them. For these employees, the newfound stillness of Harvard brings its own challenges. Even as the University advised staff members to practice social distancing and an abundance of caution at work, employees say they struggle to follow these new guidelines when faced with the reality of small kitchens and a lack of personal protective equipment.
As employees who worked at closed dining halls were placed on paid leave, those who are required to work as usual are forced to make a hard decision. At-risk individuals may request to stay home — but it comes at a cost.
For Elrhanifi, the policy means either staying home to care for his daughters, or collecting his paycheck.
For some Harvard employees still required to report for on-campus work, public transportation is the only option available. Every morning and evening, these staff members ride buses and trains to work. Omika D. Napit, a general service employee at Lowell, describes the atmosphere of her daily commute. “The bus used to be almost full with people before, but now there are only three to four people on the bus,” she wrote in an email.
Mostafa Oubtrou, a general cook in Quincy House, adds his own experience: “I have to take the train to get to the job. So my risk starts when I wake up. I’m scared,” he says. “I can’t keep doing that.”
Other employees who have tried to avoid public transportation at all costs face a different risk. Ted, a Lowell dining hall worker who requested that his name be withheld for fear of retaliation from HUDS management, faces a unique dilemma when it comes to his commute. Fearful of contracting the virus on public transportation and spreading it to his family and co-workers, he has driven to and from work every day over the past few weeks; however, he does not have his full license and thus could face legal ramifications.
Ted, who is East-Asian, also is wary of public transportation for a different reason — overt racism. He says a fellow East-Asian co-worker’s experience on the T increased his reluctance to take public transport: “People were trying not to go close to her and saying to her ‘please go away’ and all that… She wants to stay home rather than come to work but she is not sure she is going to get paid,” he explains. “She does not have enough sick time or vacation.”
No matter the commute, all scheduled staff are required to appear at work as per usual.
Though students woke up to clear instructions directing their exodus from campus, dining staff didn’t learn what their future would be like until that afternoon.
“This is how Harvard works I guess,” Ted says. “They are not going to tell you everything about everything, they are just going to go step-by-step,”
For Ted, the email addressed to “Team HUDS” brought confusion rather than clarity. “They said that all dining hall employees had to come. And if we didn’t come, would we get paid? I don’t know.”
While students relished their final moments on campus in advance of spring break, dining hall workers wondered whether their jobs would survive the week — and what they would look like if they did.
For HUDS workers like Ted, extended periods of uncertainty characterized the transition from dining halls brimming with students to a landscape of deserted dorm rooms. Soon this perceived lack of clarity gave way to what some see as a lack of caution.
Lowell would remain open after spring break — and Ted was expected back. Though his work routine resumed, he worried the Lowell House kitchens didn’t seem to match the evolving gravity of the pandemic beyond the house gates.
Harvard kept the Quincy, Eliot and Kirkland, Lowell, and Adams House kitchens open for undergraduates who remain on campus, and the Cabot and Pforzheimer kitchen open for graduate students. At these dining halls, meal procedures have been altered to protect staff and students from infection. While HUDS employees prepare food as usual in the kitchens, students receive their meals in pre-made to-go bags and students are kept six feet apart by strips of tape on the floor.
But for some, these measures don’t go far enough. Each day when he arrives at work, Ted confronts what he sees as a disconnect between health recommendations heard on the news and the reality for workers in the Lowell dining hall.
The conditions of food preparation have remained largely unchanged. Beyond new CDC-issued signs on handwashing procedures, workers operate much the same as they did when feeding thousands of students.
“[There has been] no training at all, just verbal guidance like washing hands frequently, keeping distance,” says Jaime Ayala, a general cook at Lowell House. He holds serious concerns about the feasibility of the new guidance, however.
For Rachel A. Herman, another general cook in Lowell, the subterranean architecture of the dining hall’s kitchen makes it difficult to stay far enough apart from her coworkers. “There really is no way to do social distancing,” she says. Recalling that the house was first built in 1930, she says that the tight space of the kitchens “is like a dungeon.”
Oubtrou says the same. “There is no way in the kitchen you can stand six feet away from each other,” he says. “That makes no sense.”
To complicate matters further, the University has not provided any dining hall workers with extra personal protective equipment. “They are telling us that masks are not necessary, but options,” Ted explains. “We can bring our masks from home but they are not going to purchase any masks for us.” On April 3, the CDC recommended that all people should wear protective masks when leaving their homes.
“I asked them ‘what are you doing to safeguard the food and the people that are working? How are people using social distance at 6 feet?” Herman recalls. “My boss won’t answer me.”
Crista Martin, a HUDS spokesperson, declined to comment on the record on the safety concerns raised by dining hall employees. According to Martin, HUDS currently serves the more than 450 remaining on campus. The workers who staff their dining halls are considered essential.
Empty tables and bagged meals are not the only changes that have occured at Harvard dining halls. Many say a new and intense fear permeates corridors and kitchens, signifying that, contrary to Harvard’s emails, things are not back to business as usual.
“A lot of people do not show symptoms, so we might come in thinking that we are fine,” Ted explains. “We might contaminate the staff and the dining hall. But we have to come in.”
A few days after the rooms of Quincy House had been evacuated and silence had settled into its empty halls, Kimwana L. Devonish, a general cook who had worked at Harvard for 16 years, returned home to unsettling news. The conversation he had with his wife that evening was one he’d feared for weeks. Their family, his wife told him, had been exposed to the virus.
His wife is a nurse at Boston Medical Center. Each day, as Devonish went back to work in the Quincy dining hall, the number of patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 at Boston Medical Center increased. After a few days, the inevitable occurred.
Ms. Devonish had been in contact with a patient with the coronavirus and was ordered into immediate self-isolation at home. As Ms. Devonish began her quarantine, her husband realized the danger of his own presence at Quincy.
Devonish knew he had to tell his manager. Surely, he reasoned, his manager would encourage him to remain home to keep the virus from entering the cramped Quincy kitchen.
Devonish made his case: “‘Look, I don’t know if I should be here,” he recalls saying. “I don’t think I should be here no more, because I don’t want to risk none of the other employees that are working with me.’”
He was surprised by the response he received. “If I don’t have the symptoms, I have to come to work. Because my name is on the schedule.”
Devonish was given the same print-out that Elrhanifi received when he indicated his need to remain at home. “Basically he told me, if you want to go home, you can use your sick time,” Devonish recalls. “And then, when your sick time runs out, you can use your vacation time.”
Mostafa Oubtrou — facing different risks — received the same response. “I am high risk, my family, I have three kids, I have my mother. I don’t want to end up getting everybody sick,” he says, explaining why he too requested time off.
Oubtrou’s mother, who lives with his family, has asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol — putting her at high risk for the virus. Oubtrou has three children, two of whom have returned from college, placing an extra financial strain on the family. He is over 60 years old, putting him at an elevated risk for serious health complications as a result of the coronavirus.
Oubtrou, like Devonish and Elrhanifi, spoke to a Harvard manager about his concerns and requested to stay home. They spoke over the phone — the manager had been working from home since campus shut down.
At first, things seemed promising: “Stay with your family,” Oubtrou recalls being told. “That’s your choice; stay home.” But then came the catch: “She told me that you’ve got to use your sick days. Then I said okay, so I have only four left. Then she told me, after that, you can use your vacation time.”
Oubtrou had four sick days remaining. The rest had been spent earlier in the year caring for his sick mother, the same person he was hoping to protect by staying home.
Oubtrou felt as if he was drowning. “What do they think? How am I going to pay my bills?” His stored time-off provided little hope. “I don’t even have too many sick days, you know — I have only four left.”
Oubtrou has worked at Harvard for 26 years. As a result, he has been able to accrue the benefits afforded to long-term employees, including four weeks of vacation time. He can use these benefits to ensure his payment for the next month.
“I don’t want to have to use [my vacation days] for this situation,” he says. “I want to use them for a vacation with my kids.”
But if Oubtrou wants to stay home to protect his family, he has no other choice.
For Herman, the choice was simple: “What’s the point of having a paycheck you can’t spend because you’re dead?”
Rachel Herman has worked at Harvard for more than two decades. But after her managers denied her vacation request, she immediately began to think about what might happen to her if she continued. Mentioning studies that demonstrate that older individuals are more likely to die from the virus, Herman worries that she could be risking her life by continuing her tenure. “Guess what? I’m going to be 62 this year. I don’t want to go to work,” she explains. So she went home, choosing to spend her benefits.
Faced with the dilemma presented by the University’s new policies, Devonish decided to accept whatever Harvard imposed. He says he was not willing to endanger his friends and co-workers. He told his manager, “Whatever I have, just use it. I don’t even care, I just want to get out of here, because I don’t wanna hurt nobody.”
“I don’t want to think about none of my friends or none of my fellow workers dying because I came to work,” Devonish explains.
Devonish says he believes Harvard’s policies do not reflect the gravity of the situation. “They were still trying to be sturdy and strong and say: ‘This is what we say, this is what you’re going to do,’” he recalls. “And it’s kind of like, no, this is a crisis. You can’t be like that. You have to work with people.”
Devonish feels a lack of empathy from Harvard, which seems to disregard his long tenure at the University. “I was really upset at Harvard because, you know, it was 16 years of my life. For them to treat people the way they’re treating people, it’s really sad.”
Devonish has not returned to work since Monday, March 23 — soon after his wife was exposed to the virus. His wife has completed her quarantine and returned to work at Boston Medical Center. She is being tested regularly for coronavirus. Devonish spends his days at home with his seven-year-old son and his mother-in-law. He is approaching the end of his allotted sick days and will soon begin to spend his vacation time.
Oubtrou also made the decision to stay home despite Harvard’s policies. “If you have family, after somebody gets sick, what are you going to do with the money?” he asks. “It’s going to be too late.”
Before he stopped working, Oubtrou would take the T to Harvard each morning, where he worked all day in close quarters with fellow employees, before boarding the T once more to return to his family. This routine became unacceptable. “I’m going to stop. You know, it doesn’t matter. My family comes first,” he decided.
Oubtrou has already exhausted his four sick days and is currently in his second of four weeks of “vacation.” He will begin to go unpaid at the end of April.
Part-time workers like Elrhanifi receive even less paid time off.
When he received the piece of paper informing him of the paid leave policies, Elrhanifi had no remaining sick days or vacation time. Harvard wanted him to spend his benefits. He had none. His only option was borrowed time — two weeks of “sick leave debt” that had to be repaid to the University. When that time elapsed, his name would still appear on the Harvard dining services’ roster. Even though Harvard would not be paying Elrhanifi, they would still claim him as an employee, making him ineligible for unemployment benefits.
Oubtrou, Herman, Devonish, and Elrhanifi are all choosing to stay home regardless of Harvard’s policies, they say, in order to protect themselves, their families, and their co-workers. Harvard’s policies, then, act not as deterrents from leaving work, but as costs workers must pay to keep themselves and their families safe.
“We don’t have no choice,” Oubtrou says. “But it’s not right.”

Myriam Sidibe has a Ph.D. in handwashing. Well, almost.
“If you look at it very literally, I don’t have a Ph.D. in handwashing: I have a doctorate in public health that is focused on handwashing with soap, and I spent the last 20 years thinking about handwashing with soap. That is the reality,” Sidibe clarifies.
A senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, Sidible is one of the world’s leading experts on the role that brands and corporations play in maintaining public health. She has devoted her career to changing the handwashing paradigm, utilizing both public health advocacy and private sector mobilization.
But before the sink came the lavatory. After earning a bachelor’s degree in engineering, followed by a master’s degree in water and waste engineering, Sidibe “went to build some toilets in Burundi,” as she explains casually. She noticed, however, that no one was using the handwashing facilities.
“They were basically being used to drop bags of rice and bags of flour,” Sidibe explains. It wasn’t as if people were skipping handwashing for lack of soap and water — instead, she needed to find a way to motivate people to wash their hands. With this task in mind, she decided to pursue a Ph.D. in public health.
For her doctoral research, Sidibe studied the handwashing behavior of children in India and Senegal. “I spent a lot of time looking at 4,300 kids coming out of the toilet, monitoring whether they were washing their hands,” she says. The time loitering outside the bathroom served a purpose: She wanted to examine “what motivates the kids to want to wash their hands.”
Her next steps were clear: handwashing requires soap — and the corporations that produce it. As one of the only people in the world conducting handwashing research, she presented her work to Unilever, the world’s largest manufacturer of soap, and was soon recruited to join its team. Fifteen years later, she continues to work with the corporation to advance a global handwashing program that has reached more than one billion people.
At present, Sidibe is fighting COVID-19 in Kenya. Handwashing is a critical part of slowing the spread of coronavirus, putting her in a unique position: “How do I sit during a global pandemic? You know, when I’m an expert in handwashing with soap, and I’ve also been given the power of the private sector to try to do good?”
First and foremost, she examines community needs. “How do we support them? How do we support health workers?” she asks herself. Then she involves the corporate sector to address those concerns. Currently, she is working with a coalition of 55 companies to create a platform of communication to promote handwashing and social distancing and provide resources to underserved communities.
So generally, how should corporate responsibility manifest itself in the age of COVID-19? Sidibe boils it down to three principles.
The first is responsible marketing: “They can make sure that they’re not causing panic,” she explains and that they are “telling people any soap will work.”
Second, Sidibe says that corporations should join local coalitions because “public-private partnerships are going to be critical.” She believes that corporate power can act as a buffer for countries lacking assets. “The governments in a lot of our countries don’t have enough resources to be able to unlock this,” she says.
Sidibe’s third priority is keeping the companies themselves afloat with what she terms “business resilience.” For instance, she advises against simply “flooding the markets with free soap,”despite its importance in times of pandemic.
Sidibe says she believes that as a whole, the private sector has a crucial role to play in combating COVID-19. The provision of soap and supplies is crucial: “Somebody has to continue doing the manufacturing,” she says. At the same time, corporations ought not to “build business models that are going to exploit the situation.” Sidibe emphasizes the importance of taking the needs of communities into consideration in order to then best leverage the private sector’s resources. It’s a balance that needs to be struck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 500 Greater Boston area restaurateurs have signed onto a letter to Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 requesting emergency relief for restaurants whose profits are suffering amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Since Baker’s March order to close dine-in restaurants statewide, many local eateries say they have struggled with reduced business and have even been forced to furlough staff.
Jonathan Mendez of Saloniki Greek and Tony Maws of Craigie on Main co-wrote the letter and circulated it among other restaurant owners.
Mendez said in an interview that many local restaurants “self-immolated” by closing their doors to protect the health of their patrons, and now are pleading with the state government for help.
The letter requests emergency support for both businesses and individual employees, including grants, rent relief, and suspension of local taxes.
Though Mendez said the group did not mail the letter directly to Baker, they have circulated it online and through word of mouth. He said he takes it as “an article of faith” that the letter has reached the governor’s desk.
A spokesperson for Baker did not respond to requests for comment.
Maws said he has met with state lawmakers to discuss solutions.
“Whether or not they're going to be able to actually come through — that's what remains to be seen,” Maws said.
Holly Heslop, co-owner of several area restaurants including Cambridge Common and Cambridge Eats & Beats, also signed onto the letter and said that saying goodbye to the restaurants’ customers was a “crushing” experience.
“Our business is really neighborhood hangouts. So we have so many really devoted loyal regulars who we see everyday or a couple of times a week,” she said. “Just that instant loss of community was very hard for everyone to process.”
“That doesn’t even begin to touch on the financial impact to our employees. We chose to furlough everyone so they can retain their benefits, which you can’t do if you’re laid off, but you know, no one had a chance to plan for this,” Heslop added.
Aaron Cohen — who owns Somerville’s Gracie’s Ice Cream and also signed the letter — said that, though some emergency loan programs are already in place, they do not provide sufficient relief for struggling small businesses.
“What you're doing is like somebody fell overboard on the boat and then you’ve thrown them a brick,” Cohen said. “How are we supposed to pay those loans back?”
Cohen said his business has been surviving on t-shirt sales. For him, the crisis is unprecedented — the biggest shutdown his business faced previously was a dysfunctional ice cream freezer on Labor Day weekend.
Despite the hardships the restaurants are facing, Maws — one of the letter’s co-authors — said their advocacy has also provided a source of hope.
“In one way, it is very horrific and devastating and confusing and uncertain,” Maws said. “In another way, I’m also very proud and invigorated and energized by trying to overcome this challenge to keep our doors open and give ourselves a shot to have a business that might rebound.”
In a Facebook post, Gracie’s Ice Cream encouraged patrons to remain steadfast.
“It’s gonna maybe get gnarly, so try to take care of each other,” the post read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One hundred and nine students and 15 staff members in Harvard’s Winthrop House signed a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana urging the administration to postpone the House’s faculty dean search and retain its interim faculty deans.
The letter calls on the College to extend the terms of interim faculty deans Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan by one year and to pause the work of the Winthrop faculty dean search advisory committee until campus life resumes in Cambridge.
The signatories wrote that a change in House leadership would only wreak greater havoc on undergraduates uprooted from the campus residential system less than a month ago.
“We believe that this is crucial for maintaining continuity in the House structure in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we believe it will greatly benefit the well-being of students to see consistent House leadership amidst a global climate of uncertainty,” the letter reads.
“To disrupt this newfound House consistency brought in by the Gearans would be an unnecessary disservice to Winthrop students in the midst of a global climate of volatility,” the letter continues.
The letter further argues that students obliged to prioritize their health and financial stability during this time will not be able to fully participate in the faculty dean search and advocate for their favored candidates.
“In the name of the equalization Harvard has pushed so hard to achieve, it is paramount that this be addressed,” the letter reads. “Students want to remain as involved as possible in the Faculty Dean search, but many circumstances in this transition to remote life prevent them from doing so.”
“The current Winthrop Faculty Dean search understandably cannot be the priority for students right now, and therefore should not be the top priority for the College at this time,” the letter continues.
Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan began their interim post in August, following the College’s decision to not renew former Winthrop faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson’s contract amid a controversy over Sullivan’s decision to represent Hollywood producer and now convicted sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein.
Unusual circumstances aside, the letter is not the only formal request that Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan stay on as Winthrop faculty deans.
Students first petitioned for their permanent installation in February, when the College commenced the House’s faculty dean search by soliciting nominations for candidates. That same month, students also agitated on their behalf at a House forum, citing the supportive culture they say Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan cultivated in their term.
The letter cites Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan’s “unparalleled” management of the campus evacuation and coronavirus crisis in support of their continued stewardship.
Alexander S. “Sandy” Koenig ’21, who participated in drafting the letter, said the interim deans have served as a steady source of comfort for students scattered from campus.
“Since the College sent us all home, we felt that the Gearans as deans have provided such wonderful support in this uncertain time for everyone,” Koenig said. “We just thought it would be so much better for every Winthrop student’s peace of mind and feeling of belonging in Winthrop if Mark and Mary could be reappointed for another year as interim faculty deans.”
“We felt that given all these extraordinary circumstances, it would make sense for the College to make an extraordinary decision,” he added.
Asked for comment, College spokesperson Rachael Dane pointed to previous statements from the College that reiterate that Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan were announced as interim deans who would serve only for the year.
She also confirmed the faculty dean search is ongoing.

Harvard Business School Online has decided to discount the price of its Credential of Readiness program — CORe, for short — from its usual $2,250 to $450 in wake of the disruptions caused by coronavirus.
This 80 percent discount rate will be available to over 50,000 undergraduates who attend the 30 colleges that collaborate with HBS Online, which includes schools as proximate to the Business School as Harvard College and as far as the University of Western Australia.
CORe is comprised of three courses — Business Analytics, Economics for Managers, and Financial Accounting — as well as a final exam.
The online program is designed for undergraduates who want to develop their knowledge of business and prepare for an MBA program.
Valerie Krempus, an HBS Online administrator, said the decision to reduce the price of the program was partially influenced by pandemic-related economic consequences.
“We know that economic uncertainty can be scary and that individuals’ financial situations may have drastically changed in the last few weeks,” Krempus said.
Having spoken with HBS Online’s partner colleges, Krempus mentioned that she and her colleagues were also aware of the difficulties students face during the transition to remote learning. She also said that she knew how the pandemic has disrupted students’ summer plans including internships and job prospects and that she wanted to help.
“We wanted to do what we could to make it more affordable and to allow more people to have a meaningful summer experience,” Krempus said.
Krempus said CORe’s strength comes from its “very social” nature, virtually connecting students in the program with around 300 peers from around the world.
“They really get a robust global cohort that helps them as they think about networking beyond the CORe program or as they try to wrestle through concepts while they’re going through the material itself,” Krempus said.
Although Krempus does not anticipate extending the discount for the July and August sessions of CORe, she said that, as of now, “we hope that more people can take advantage of enrolling in CORe and gaining that knowledge.”

Since Harvard shut down its campus over coronavirus, Interim Minister of Memorial Church Stephanie A. Paulsell has been preaching her sermons into her phone while under a blanket on her bed “to muffle the echoes.”
“Everything changed so much Sunday to Sunday since the beginning of March,” Paulsell said.
This upcoming Sunday is different for another reason; it is Easter Sunday, one of the most important days on the Christian calendar.
As Jewish and Christian communities around the world celebrate Passover and Easter, campus faith leaders have likewise been tasked with finding innovative ways to bring worshippers together.
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, the executive director of Harvard Hillel, wrote in an email that he would host an online Seder – a ritual meal to mark the beginning of Passover – on Thursday, the second evening of the holiday. So far, more than 170 attendees have registered for the Seder, according to Steinberg.
Harvard Hillel also held a Seder over Zoom led by Rabbi Jennifer “Jenn” Queen on Wednesday, the first evening of Passover, according to its website.
In contrast, Harvard Chabad, an affiliate of the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement, will not host a virtual Seder. Its website contains a link to Chabad.org, which explains that, per Chabad’s beliefs, a Seder should not be held over the phone or Skype.
“Shabbat and Jewish holidays are a blessed respite from all digital connectivity,” the website reads. “This means that you have the opportunity to lead your own Seder, live and in person, for your household.”
Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, the founder and leader of Harvard Chabad, wrote that, though he will hold his Seder with only immediate family in attendance, they will be “united with the entire Harvard Chabad family in our thoughts.”
“The Baal Shem Tov, founder of the Chassidic movement, taught that a person is found where their thoughts are,” Zarchi wrote in an email. “As we welcome in the awesome holiday of our redemption – amidst this very difficult time of Coronavirus — we will be thinking intensely of all in the Harvard Chabad family.”
Zarchi also said Chabad provided students still living on campus with some of the components of the Seder plate.
“For the students that stayed in Cambridge and are away from their families for the Passover holiday, we helped many secure Seder provisions, including Shmura Matzah – referred to in the Kabbalah as the Bread of Faith and Healing,” Zarchi wrote.
Crista Martin, a spokesperson for Harvard University Dining Services, wrote in an email that HUDS was working with students still on campus to ensure they had access to kosher foods.
“HUDS has reached out to and spoken with students individually to support them with specific kosher products or foods based on their requests or preferences (including, of course, matzo),” Martin wrote.
Several churches in Harvard Square plan to provide audio or video services to parishioners throughout Holy Week and on Easter.
Reverend William T. Kelly, a Catholic chaplain and pastor of St. Paul’s Parish, wrote in a newsletter that the church would live-stream services for Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday.
Kelly wrote that technicians have been working to upgrade the church’s WiFi in preparation for the services.
He also wrote in the newsletter that St. Paul’s was working to ensure the safety of those who are involved in performing and broadcasting the services.
“At this writing, we are still weighing the concerns about folks (musicians, camera man, server, etc…) leaving their homes to venture out to Cambridge. It will certainly be a skeleton crew at best,” Kelly wrote.
University Lutheran Church also plans to broadcast Holy Week and Easter services via Zoom. On the church’s website, parishioners were encouraged to participate musically in the Easter Sunday services.
“Have a bell handy and ring it whenever the word ‘Alleluia’ is said or sung!” the site reads.
Harvard’s Memorial Church will offer a virtual service for Maundy Thursday — which commemorates the Last Supper — over Zoom, according to Paulsell.
“We ask everybody to just bring some food and drink, bread and wine, or crackers or juice, or whatever people have on hand,” Paulsell said. “It's a way of trying to have that ritual together. It's helpful to be able to see somebody lift up the bread and then lift up the cup and say the prayers.”
Memorial Church will also have a recorded service for Good Friday available on its website and broadcast a pre-recorded version of its Easter Sunday service over the radio, according to Paulsell.
Paulsell said that she will miss the feeling of community created by traditional Easter festivities.
“I miss everyone being together. At Easter, the church is always packed, with two services on Sunday. They're both full of people,” she said. “There's great music, usually trumpets. And the choir is so magnificent. I'm definitely going to miss the choir.”
She said she will also miss seeing the attendees dressed up for church.
“I miss seeing everybody's hats,” Paulsell added. “We're going to have people send us pictures of themselves in their Easter finery, and we'll put it up on our social media.”

UPDATED: April 9, 2020, 3:38 p.m.
After the White House recently cleared U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s new proposed Title IX rule last week, DeVos is free to issue the new guidelines at any time — a decision that legal experts have criticized amid the coronavirus crisis.
In November 2018, DeVos proposed the new rule for colleges and universities that receive federal funding. The rule would require those colleges and universities to cross-examine witnesses when formally investigating allegations of sexual misconduct, among a number of other significant changes to Title IX procedures.
DeVos’s initial proposal was followed by a public comment period that lasted until Jan. 30, 2019. The Department of Education received more than 100,000 comments in that period — including criticisms submitted by Harvard in conjunction with a coalition of other universities.
Federal law requires the DOE to read every comment submitted; given the large volume of feedback, the release of the guidelines was stalled for months during the extensive review period.
After the DOE read the comments, the White House’s Office of Budget and Management undertook a review of the guidelines, which it completed on March 27, 2020, according to POLITICO.
An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment on when the rule would be published.
The Trump administration’s forward movement on the rule, meanwhile, has elicited criticism from Title IX experts — including Harvard Law School professor Janet E. Halley and lecturer Diane L. Rosenfeld.
Halley said in an interview she feels the DOE should stall policy changes while universities grapple with emergent problems posed by the ongoing pandemic.
“I think that this is a terrible time to introduce demanding new guidelines,” Halley said. “The faculty and administrators and students all over the country are trying their hardest right now to catch up with the changes because of the pandemic.”
Rosenfeld, who lectures on gender violence and legal policy at HLS, similarly criticized the decision. At Harvard, the pandemic led to a sudden University-wide switch to online classes last month, with most students being sent off campus and in-person operations largely halting.
“I think that it is an inopportune time to drop the comments right now when schools are just struggling to figure out how best to serve their students in the face of this diaspora of students,” she said.
Rosenfeld added that she believes that, by clearing the way for the guidelines’ release amid the pandemic, the Trump administration is exploiting the fact that colleges and universities are overwhelmed by other issues and may lack the bandwidth to address the policy changes.
“New cases are not being brought, so it seems like there’s not an impetus to release the rule right now except to take advantage of the fact that people are occupied with survival questions and with getting through the rest of the semester,” she said. “So I think it would almost be in bad faith to do it in a time like this.”
The DOE did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the professors’ criticisms.
Harvard’s Title IX Office, which will be in charge of implementing DeVos’s new guidelines when they are released, declined to comment on the timeline update.
University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said in an interview last Monday that Harvard’s Title IX office has carried on its operations remotely over the past few weeks and will continue to receive and address disclosures from students.
Though the Title IX office and Office for Dispute Resolution will continue to function online, Halley pointed out that the switch from in-person to virtual communication might prove disruptive when it comes in the middle of an open Title IX case.
“There are issues about online environments that are different than face-to-face environments,” she said. “For instance, the inability of investigators to meet face-to-face, in person with people that they're interviewing.”
To address such difficulties posed by social distancing, Rosenfeld said it might be beneficial for the DOE to release official guidance on how universities should proceed with Title IX investigations during the pandemic.
“I think that schools would probably really appreciate guidance on what to do with existing cases,” she said. “I would think about doing an interim rule that specifically addresses the situation of what to do with hearings that are going on right now, how to do them in a fair way at a distance through Zoom, how to protect survivors and to make sure it’s a fair process and that everyone gets heard.”
Correction: April 9, 2020
A previous version of the caption for this article incorrectly stated the current location of Harvard's Title IX Office. It is in the Smith Campus Center, not 44R Brattle Street.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 9, 2020, 11:30 a.m.
After the closure of Harvard’s campus last month spelled the sudden end of many undergraduates’ campus jobs, students seeking online employment to supplement lost income say Harvard has failed to offer them a sufficient array of work opportunities.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email to undergraduates last month that those who cannot perform their former on-campus jobs remotely should seek other online employment opportunities through the Student Employment Office.
But some students say finding such opportunities has been a challenge. Joseph A. Hasbrouck ’20, who worked as a manager of Quincy House Grille on campus, said he feels the directive to seek remote employment is “unrealistic.”
“A lot of the jobs on campus don't have any remote opportunity,” he said. “You can't do Dorm Crew right from home. You can't work at an on-campus restaurant or one of the cafes from home. And so, for a lot of these things, there just aren't opportunities available to replace them.”
As of Tuesday evening, filtering the Student Employment Office’s job database for remote jobs offered during the spring semester of this academic year yielded just 17 total postings.
Of those 17 current job offerings, just four positions list Harvard as the employer. They include a writing and social media intern at the Harvard Library; a social and digital media program assistant at the Harvard School of Public Health’s Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness; a research assistant at the Harvard Advanced Leadership Initiative; and a podcast host and production intern at Harvard Library Communications.
Only the latter two of those four positions are available to undergraduates.
In his email to students last month, Burke noted that undergraduates whose financial aid packages included a term-time work expectation will now only have to fund half of that original expectation.
Some students, however, said they rely on-campus employment not merely to fulfill term-time work expectations, but also to financially support themselves and their families.
Marcus M. Trenfield ’21, a former Dorm Crew employee, said he typically aimed to work six hours each week while on campus to pay for medication to manage a chronic illness.
“The idea was, let me work an on-campus job so that I can lift that toll off my parents, especially since they already have a lot of medical debt on my behalf from the time it took to get a diagnosis,” he said.
Trenfield, who said he is on “significant financial aid,” explained his need for income only increased upon leaving campus after his father lost half his working hours due to the pandemic.
His father then fell sick and was forced to self-isolate, Trenfield said. These circumstances, coupled with the chance that his mother, too, could become ill, threatened financial trouble for his family.
“When I was applying, these circumstances brought an added motivator for me to make sure I had a job,“ Trenfield explained.
Trenfield checked the Student Employment Office database, but said he had little luck finding a job for which he felt he had the requisite background skills.
“There was, at the time, maybe like two or three online jobs,” he said. “I actually ended up applying to jobs outside of the website.”
Trenfield, who ultimately settled for a remote position as an English teacher, said the database still has “very few” jobs in proportion to the “sheer number” of students looking for employment right now.
“I'd imagine there's a lot of students who find themselves in a position where they need a way to make some sort of supplemental income to support their family,” he said. “And Harvard's not really offering that.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not provide on-the-record comment on the number of job listings or the student criticisms.
Kyle O’Connor ’22, who worked as a shelving assistant at Harvard Business School’s library, said the physical threat of the coronavirus has also limited students’ opportunities to find jobs in their local areas.
“Right now, just in the climate that we're in, I've noticed that the jobs that are available are high-risk ones on the front line, like grocery stores and stuff,” he said. “If people are very worried about their health, then it's not really an option for people with compromised immune systems or other health issues.”
Other students said they have appreciated that their on-campus employers have been flexible in allowing them to transition to remote work and log online hours.
Olivia M. Hall ’21, who held jobs at the Eliot House Grille and Academic Resource Center, said she is grateful she can continue her latter role remotely, despite losing the former. She added that ARC has continued to pay tutors and has not altered employees’ hours.
Paul D. Tamburro ’21, who gives tours at the Harvard Art Museums, said he and his fellow guides have been working remotely to promote community engagement and give virtual tours on Zoom to senior citizens.
Tamburro, a former Crimson news editor, added the museum guides can also bill hours for doing research on artwork for future tours, or for making playlists for the museums’ various galleries.
“I'm working more than I expected to,” he said. “We're really encouraged to be creative too, which is nice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton called on Harvard to disclose whether it employs African American asset managers in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow last month.
In the letter, Sharpton asked that Harvard release a report detailing whether any senior African American professionals are involved in internally managing the school’s $40.9 billion endowment.
Sharpton also asked that Harvard disclose any African Americans in direct management positions or in senior leadership positions at any external management firms the University may work with.
Sharpton signed his letter to Bacow in his capacity as president of the National Action Network, Sharpton’s civil rights nonprofit.
Sharpton wrote that not employing diverse asset managers would be a failure of Harvard’s “fiduciary responsibility.”
“While the systematic exclusion of people of color and women from the management of endowment assets has been a question of social justice over time, today it is for me a question of fiduciary responsibility,” Sharpton wrote. “Study after study shows very high performing women and people of color, yet those same studies show under-utilization by asset allocators.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed the receipt of the letter but declined to comment before a response to Sharpton.
Harvard Management Company spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan wrote in an emailed statement that HMC has taken a three-pronged approach towards increasing diversity among its asset managers.
“First and foremost, we seek diversity and inclusion amongst our team at HMC, including those who make decisions to allocate capital to external investment managers,” McKiernan wrote. “We are proud of the diversity of our team.”
McKiernan wrote that HMC has worked with outside groups to “ensure consideration of diverse managers.”
“When considering the diversity of an external manager, we do not limit our view merely to the leadership level, but also try to consider their entire team,” McKiernan wrote.
Finally, HMC is “increasingly focused” on the diversity of investments of external managers, according to McKiernan.
“Having an external manager, no matter however diverse, investing with non-diverse companies is not of particular interest,” McKiernan wrote.
In his letter, Sharpton cited the University of California’s recent report to university administrators and state legislators outlining the school system’s efforts to promote diverse hiring practices among its endowment managers.
“This report does not mitigate the harm and moral stain of past transgressions, but it does show that the University of California is receptive to the idea of integrating people of color into every part of their university to create the best possible institution,” Sharpton wrote.
On their website, the Harvard Management Company posted a statement noting that diversity is a priority when working with firms.
“Diversity and inclusion is an important issue in the workplace, not only for our external managers, but for the investments that they make,” the website reads. “A central tenet of HMC’s investment culture is the belief that a healthy organization is critical to investment success. To succeed, firms must attract and retain the best talent from the broadest pool possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Executive and continuing education programs — a growing source of revenue for the University — have been stymied by campus closure, the latest in a mounting number of financial challenges Harvard will face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Executive and continuing education — non-degree granting programs aimed at mid-career professionals — netted $500 million in revenue for the University last year, equal to 9 percent of its total revenue, per the University’s 2019 Financial Report.
Harvard earned only slightly more from its “degree-seeking” undergraduate and graduate programs, at $504 million.
Executive and continuing education revenues also increased substantially more in the last fiscal year than undergraduate and graduate revenues, at 12 percent and 4 percent growth, respectively.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said those revenues have dropped as a result of coronavirus in an interview with the Harvard Gazette — a university-run publication — on Monday.
“We have seen a decline in continuing and executive education revenues — a precipitous drop,” Bacow said. “So the immediate effects [of the pandemic] are significant already.”
Nine of Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools offer executive and continuing education programs throughout the year, per the financial report.
Harvard Kennedy School posted an update to its executive education website on March 20, writing that “there will be no teaching and learning programs conducted on campus for the remainder of the semester,” including executive education.
“We are reviewing our open enrollment executive programs scheduled through the spring and summer and are considering several options for each program, including offering an online version or offering at a future date,” according to the website.
Some upcoming programs at the Kennedy School are listed as taking place online. However, the program fee for online courses is significantly lower than for in-person courses.
The Kennedy School’s executive education website lists a $1,500 fee for online modules of “Leading Successful Programs: Using Evidence to Assess Effectiveness” in April and May. In contrast, the program fee for an on-campus module of that same course in April 2021 is $9,700 to cover “tuition, housing, curricular materials and most meals,” per the website.
In October 2019, Harvard’s Office of Financial Strategy and Planning published a report entitled “Financial Resilience at Harvard: A Recession Playbook,” as part of its widespread efforts to prepare for a potential financial downturn.
The report said growth in executive and continuing education since the 2008 recession makes it “difficult to predict” the impact the coronavirus pandemic will have on these programs from an economic standpoint.
Experts say declining revenue from executive education programs would pose a significant financial loss for the University.
Christian T. Lundblad, a business professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wrote in an email that programs like executive education are an “important” revenue source for universities.
“These sorts of things make up an important part of the revenue of the school, even if formal tuition continues,” Lundblad wrote.
Thomas D. Parker ’64 — a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy — theorized that of Harvard’s 12 schools, those with more robust executive and continuing education programs, like the Business School, will be hit the hardest.
The Business School boasts over 60 on-campus executive education programs. In total, its programs drew over 12,600 participants in 2019, including Hollywood celebrities and media moguls.
Still, Parker said he still believes individuals and companies will be interested in online offerings at any Harvard school in the area of executive and continuing education.
“The Harvard name is very attractive, and there are a lot of people who will pay for that name, whether they actually physically set foot on campus or not,” Parker said.

Harvard Law School will delay its Early Interview Program until January 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, according to a March 31 email to students.
The Early Interview Program facilitates the hiring process by offering on-campus interviews for rising second year students interested in private sector employment. The Law School originally scheduled the program for July 27-31 at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square.
This year the Law School also planned to pilot additional programming for EIP week. This new component — called EIP Preview —would allow students to apply to up to 5 employers in advance and interview before the official EIP Week.
Although the standard EIP Week will still take place in January, the Law School decided to suspend the pilot for this recruiting season.
In his email to students, Law School Associate Dean for Career Services Mark Weber wrote that the decision to postpone EIP Week resulted in part from the Law School’s transition to a universal pass-fail grading system for the spring 2020 semester.
“This change will enable you to have one more semester of grades to share with employers and will give you additional time to explore and make well-considered career decisions,” the email reads.
Weber’s email also states that the new timeline aims to alleviate the stress students may be facing following the switch to online learning.
“We hope this additional time will give you one less thing to think about in the coming months and allow you to focus on your well-being, settle into what for many of you is a changed living situation, and adjust to our new remote learning environment,” he wrote.
Law School student George Z. He wrote in an email that he supports the school’s decision since the state of the coronavirus pandemic remains unclear.
“I don't think it makes sense to plan on sending students out for interviews amid all of the uncertainty,” He wrote.
But he also noted that students interested in EIP Week may be discouraged from participating in “externships” or clinics offered during the University’s January Term, which may now overlap with the postponed program.
Law School student Kiah D. Duggins, president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, echoed this concern. She explained that the new dates for EIP Week may conflict with an annual workshop hosted by the bureau in January.
“We are now in conversation with the HLAB Board and the registrar about the options that HLAB students can have if they want to participate in both EIP and [Trial Advocacy Workshop],” she wrote in an emailed statement.
Ivanka D. Canzius, another Law School student, said she thinks the postponement may actually increase the number of students who choose to participate in the Early Interview Program because it will not conflict with summer internship plans.
“Doing it in January might actually increase the participation because it will be during the time that students are normally back in school anyway,” Canzius said.
In his email, Weber stated that the Law School administration appreciates the student input it receives and will provide future updates.
“We are listening and want you to know that every decision we make is through the lens of how we can best support you and your career opportunities,” the email reads. “In the meantime, please stay safe, stay healthy, stay strong, and know that we’ll navigate these challenges together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 10, 2020, 9:20 p.m.
Students from Harvard School of Public Health are joining the workforce through initiatives to support both the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Harvard University Health Services during the coronavirus pandemic.
Hundreds of student volunteers will help the Department of Public Health with contact tracing efforts across the state by identifying and reaching out to anyone potentially exposed to coronavirus. Others will assist HUHS by communicating with and creating health promotion programming for University affiliates and tracking the latest public health recommendations.
In a briefing on Friday, Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 said the state was stepping up its contact tracing efforts as the number of the cases continues to grow. As of Wednesday evening, there were 16,790 recorded cases of COVID-19 and 433 deaths in Massachusetts.
The DPH contact tracing effort involves the Academic Health Department Consortium, a government partnership with eleven academic institutions in the state including the School of Public Health, Boston University School of Public Health, and Tufts University.
Cristina Alonso and Eric M. Coles, School of Public Health doctoral students, are co-leading the coordination of the student volunteer workforce across the eleven institutions. Alonso said 1,600 students have expressed interest in volunteering through a survey.
Alonso and Coles are in the process of contacting the state’s 351 local boards of health and pairing students with them. Alonso said each of these cities and towns have different needs from contact tracing to translation assistance, which are met by the “diversity of schools and programs” involved in the effort.
“We feel even better equipped to meet the needs because the boards need everything from people who can make phone calls and give elders information, to designing and mapping cases versus where we send volunteers,” Alonso said.
Based on his conversations with several boards, Coles said the Massachusetts public health infrastructure is in “dire need” of assistance as parts of the state face “a huge uphill battle.”
Coles said he hopes the additional student support for public health officials across the state will decrease the number of hospitalizations.
“If we had a stronger public health infrastructure nationwide then we wouldn't see as many people in the hospital,” Coles said. “We would be able to keep people healthy and not needing clinical care, and I think that's really important.”
In addition to state-wide public health initiatives, some students work directly with HUHS to assist in its communications with individual University affiliates, track recommendations from public health experts, and help establish health promotion programming.
HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an emailed statement that he reached out to the School of Public Health a few weeks ago to begin a collaboration between HUHS and public health students.
“While this pandemic brings about tremendous challenges, it also provides learning opportunities for public health students to gain invaluable real-world experience, all while expanding our capacity to respond to inquiries and reports from our community,” he wrote.
After Nguyen reached out to the School of Public Health, the school’s student association “mobilized and organized the students” to volunteer with HUHS.
Lucas E. Buyon, the president of the student association, said more than 200 students responded to the initial volunteer form within 72 hours. He said the first 25 volunteers began their work this week but added that more may be needed as the situation evolves.
“Positions will get added as the pandemic is ongoing and we get a better sense of areas where we can help HUHS, also as the need grows. Right now there's a moderate level of call and email volume in HUHS, but perhaps as the situation in Massachusetts deteriorates, which I don't think it will, as of now,” Buyon said. “That could definitely increase the role of students in information management for HUHS.”
Buyon said the contributions of student volunteers allowed for HUHS physicians and nurses who were previously doing the work to have more time for clinical duties.
According to Buyon, students at the School of Public Health are “hopeful” this project could lead to further collaborations between them and HUHS.
“Particularly when it comes to health promotion work, this is an area of public health work that won't really go away even after the pandemic is over,” Buyon said. “We're really hoping that perhaps this will be the catalyst of a pipeline for students at the Chan School to give back to the broader Harvard community, as well as gain practical real world experience within the domain of Harvard as a whole.”

Researchers at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, along with colleagues at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Montreal, discovered a pair of white dwarf stars that orbit each other and produce gravitational waves — the first wave source of this type ever found.
The discovery — published April 6 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, a journal where astrophysicists can submit short notices of original research — marks the first confirmed source of gravitational waves from a double helium-core, white dwarf system. Named J2322+0509, the pair exhibits an orbital period of just over 20 minutes, the third shortest period of all detached binaries detected so far.
Einstein’s century-old theory of general relativity predicted the existence of gravitational waves – ripples in spacetime – emitted by two masses accelerating around each other, but these waves were only verified experimentally a few years ago.
“Astronomy was done almost exclusively by collecting light with telescopes,” said Abraham “Avi” Loeb, the chair of the Astronomy department. “But here is a new way of looking at the universe that we now have, which is gravitational waves.”
When stars like the sun burn up all of their fuel, they become white dwarfs, or compact stellar cores, according to Loeb.
Now that gravitational waves have been confirmed to originate from this binary system, this “verification binary” can help train the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna gravitational wave observatory, set to launch in 2034.
“We know this is a system that LISA will detect shortly after it turns on,” according to Warren F. Brown, lead author on the study and an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics.
Since white dwarfs produce gravitational waves at the same frequencies LISA would be able to detect, they could potentially interfere with the detection of signals from other sources, such as the merging of black holes. This makes studying white dwarf systems all the more important, according to Loeb.
The researchers plan to continue studying the system and monitor the shrinking of the binary’s orbit.
“We are planning to observe, follow the system for the next 10 years, and we can actually see how the period is changing over time,” Mukremin Kilic said. Kilic is a co-author of the study and a physics and astronomy professor at the University of Oklahoma.
Brown said the white dwarf system was initially difficult to detect, due to the absence of a “light curve.” He noted, however, that the binary’s face-on orientation to the Earth resulted in gravitational waves over twice as strong as those that would have resulted from an edge-on alignment.
“It’s a fun fact, some of the most difficult-to-detect binaries may actually be the strongest gravitational wave sources. There might be some among the brightest, nearby stars, we just haven’t detected them,” Brown said.
Though the coronavirus pandemic has closed all telescopes and mandated a shift to remote research, Brown said he and his team remain dedicated to finding similar white dwarf systems.
“But just having one is an interesting anchor on the true number of systems in the galaxy,” Brown said.
“The nice thing about astronomy is that you can discover things that are unusual,” Kilic said.“There are so many unknowns in astronomy still, but there’s a lot of space for new discoveries.”

The Harvard College Writing Center has transitioned to virtual tutoring appointments for the remainder of the semester, after the College announced its decision to move to remote instruction due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Writing Center — staffed by trained undergraduate tutors — provides free, individual conferences for students at the College to improve general writing skills and workshop specific pieces of writing, including class assignments and fellowship applications.
When Writing Center director Jane Rosenzweig, learned that “remote learning might be a possibility,” she said there was “never any question” about whether the Writing Center would continue to offer appointments virtually.
“The Writing Center holds approximately 100 appointments a week during the semester, and many students depend on us to support them in their academic writing,” Rosenzweig said.
Writing Center tutor Ariel G. Vilidnitsky ’20 recounted how the Writing Center began discussing the possibility of offering virtual appointments several weeks prior to the official dismissal of students from campus. Within days of the College’s announcement of the new virtual format for classes, the Writing Center quickly moved to a Zoom-based system.
“We began transitioning to Zoom conferences that same week and by Thursday, all of our conferences were online,” Vilidnitsky said. “We made the switch to Zoom even before spring break to ensure the safety of both students and tutors.”
To accommodate students in different time zones, the Writing Center has also expanded its hours, according to Vilidnitsky. Tutors can now conference with students about their writing anytime between 9 a.m. and midnight EDT.
Lavanya Singh ’22, another tutor at the Writing Center, wrote in an email that Rosenzweig has been very supportive of tutors during this unprecedented time, by offering increased flexibility for scheduling work hours.
“Usually we work five hours a week, but Jane has been really understanding and flexible during this time,” Singh wrote. “She’s also offered alternative ways to get hours in (since the extra income is really important for some of us), such as contributing to the blog or helping with other writing center related events.”
With the move to an online format, Writing Center tutor Kevin L. Ballen ’22 said he thinks appointments have been running smoothly and remaining “both productive and efficient.”
Rosenzweig noted, however, that while the appointment availability has remained consistent throughout the transition to Zoom, the Writing Center has been experiencing reduced demand from students, going from “100 percent booked” during an ordinary semester to only “about 50 percent booked since spring break.” As a result, the Writing Center is currently working on developing new ways to connect with students, according to Rosenzweig.
“From reading the evaluations that students fill out after their appointments, I can say that those who have met with us since we started using Zoom are finding their meetings helpful,” Rosenzweig said. “We also hope that students who may not have visited the Writing Center before but who are finding it challenging to get papers written during this difficult time will consider us as a resource.”

8:00 AM - Didn’t think anything could be more irritating to wake up to than the Memorial Church bells? The Club Penguin background music will prove you wrong. And with the same absolute lack of heating, your igloo will feel just like a Harvard dorm!
8:15 AM - Just like Berg, the Iceberg is either empty or completely packed. When you head over for breakfast, read The Club Penguin Times in place of The Crimson, and check your “emails” (mail) to distract from the sounds of penguins drilling to tip the Iceberg.
8:45 AM - After you finish eating and catching up on current events, head back to your igloo where a confused tourist (puffle) has followed you. Luckily for you, unlike tourists, puffles can’t ask you for directions.
8:50 AM - Grab your laptop using the code “ONLINESAFETY."
8:55 AM - Replicate falling off your scooter on your rush to class by playing a game of Sled Racing.
9:00 AM - It’s time for your first class — Astronomy at the top of the Lighthouse. Use the telescope to gaze at the sea and pretend that expanse of blue is the starry night sky.
10:15 AM - While walking to the next class, you can listen to your favorite bops. Just type “E” then “T” to get the music note icon, and it’ll be almost like you’re wearing Airpods. Only there’s no Pro version here.
10:30 AM - Next up, it’s time for your favorite nondescript science class (LS50? Orgo? Something that includes weather maps?) Just like a real STEM class, this one does require a good bit of effort. First, get a friend (or a random penguin) to send you an invite to join the Elite Penguin Force, or EPF. Then, you can take the test to join this top secret group, and finally, you’ll gain access to this snazzy seminar-style room.
11:45 AM - Even on Club Penguin you won’t have time to grab a full meal yet, so get your caffeine fix by playing the Beans game inside the coffeeshop. Try not to get crushed under the weight of your responsibilities. 
12:00 PM - Time for work! Now’s your chance to show off all that Harvard (or Club Penguin) knowledge by becoming a tour guide. There may not be a Widener Library to tell Titanic anecdotes about, but I’m sure there’s still plenty of tourists and/or extremely curious highschoolers around. Don’t forget the iconic hat!
3:00 PM - You’ve got some time before dinner, so it’s the perfect opportunity to squeeze in some studying in “Lamont” like the good Harvard student you are. While no Club Penguin building can truly capture the soul-crushing aura of everyone’s favorite all-nighter location, you can at least get close to it with the brown walls and strange lighting on the top floor of the Coffee Shop.
5:30 PM - Hope you’re excited to treat yourself! Tonight, grab some friends and go out on the town for a delicious, carb-loaded dinner at the Pizza Parlor in the Plaza. These slices may be virtual, but they’ve still got me feeling nostalgic for a night at Noch’s.
7:00 PM - You’ve finished dinner and it’s a Friday night, so why not go watch a hockey game? Skip the long walk over the river to the athletic fields and waddle right on over to Club Penguin’s own ice rink. Here’s your chance to fill the void left by every sport being cancelled!
9:00 PM - After a victory by Harvard’s team, you feel in the mood for celebrating! Forget the Mather JCR or the Lowell Underground, the Nightclub has everything you could possibly need to have a great time. Good music? Fun lighting? Lots of penguins doing the exact same dance? Might as well be Yardfest!
10:00 PM - Whether you planned to go intentionally or sort of just ended up there, the Quad is the last stop for any Harvard Friday night. But no matter how many times you’ve made the journey before, every trip has you answering the question “Are you lost?” with a resounding yes. If you want to relive doubting your Google Maps skills like never before, the Iceberg is your destination.
10:30 PM - Just like navigating your way to the Pfoho Igloo, flipping the Club Penguin Iceberg requires assistance from others. However, you won’t have to approach an upperclassmen working on a pset in the dhall or walking around in their pajamas. To tip the iceberg, 30 penguins need to wear a hard hat and drill during certain events. After enough penguins are drilling, it will tip over to the opposite side to reveal a dance floor and an exclusive item, the item is dependent on the event.
12:00 AM - The Recycling Plant, a room that traps you in a loading loop during certain events, is definitely reminiscent of the confusion you’ll experience walking home from the Quad. For both experiences, just when you think you’ve found your way out, you’ll realize you’re back where you started. The fake loading bar resets after finishing with the text changing every few seconds. The key to leaving the room is walking out of frame. 
12:30 AM - You’ve had a full g-cal’s worth of things to do today, and now it’s finally time to catch some Z’s back home in your igloo. Although we may be away from Harvard, there are still plenty of creative ways to ~virtually~ follow your usual on-campus routines. After all, Club Penguin combines your favorite parts of campus with a touch of childhood nostalgia, AND with penguins instead of Canada Geese!
