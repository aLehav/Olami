After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While last night’s victory over Colgate held important implications in the Harvard women’s hockey team’s quest to capture the ECAC title, the contest’s historical significance may be even more noteworthy.
Senior Christina Kessler became Harvard’s all-time winningest goalkeeper, passing Ali Boe ’06, with her 64th career victory in last night's 5-1 win.
Kessler tied Boe’s record more than a month ago when the Crimson defeated Connecticut on Dec. 8, but due to the exam break and Canadian national team commitments, she did not get an opportunity to break the record until this weekend. After waiting for a month, Kessler finally recorded her 64th victory.
“It means a lot,” Kessler said. “Obviously it’s great to set records and what not, but I think it’s ultimately about the team and it’s a victory for the team.”
Kessler racked up 21 saves in the winning effort and was just minutes away from recording her fifth shutout of the season.
The Ontario native faced her greatest challenge near the end of the second period when the Colgate offense sent a barrage of shot attempts her way. But Kessler kept the puck from reaching the back of the net and led her team into the final period with a three-goal advantage.
“She came up with some big saves at the end of the second period,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She challenged the puck. She was aggressive and that’s what she’s going to do. She’s done that for us all year, and we’re hoping that she’s going to keep giving that to us everyday.”
So far this season, Kessler has been solid for the Crimson, sporting a 9-3-3 record. Harvard felt its goalkeeper’s absence earlier this month when Kessler missed two games while she led the Canadian Under-22 Team to a Gold Medal at the 2010 MLP Cup. With Kessler gone, the Crimson fell to Quinnipiac and tied Princeton.
But Kessler was back in net and up to her old tricks for Harvard last night with her only blemish coming with under seven minutes to play and the game already decided. Colgate’s Krista Dermott recovered the puck after a shot ricocheted off Kessler’s pads and then rifled it past the 2008 ECAC Goaltender of the Year, making the score 5-1 with minutes remaining.
When the final whistle sounded, Kessler’s teammates were quick to acknowledge their netminder, offering her a series of fist bumps. When the team trickled into the locker room, Kessler was presented a puck with “64” written across it to commemorate her achievement.
“It’s great to have my teammates support me like that,” Kessler said.
But despite the celebratory mood following the game, the record did not weigh heavily on Kessler’s mind as she switched her focus to Harvard’s upcoming matchups.
“Obviously it’s a great accomplishment, but I think ultimately it comes down to winning as a team and that’s really what was on my mind today,” Kessler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Saturday’s game, the Harvard women’s hockey team felt that it had something to prove. After a last-second goal forced the Crimson to settle for a tie with Cornell on Friday night, Harvard wasn’t about to let that happen again.
Two first-period scores set the tone as the No. 6 Crimson (9-4-4, 7-4-2 ECAC) beat up on Colgate (7-14-3, 3-6-3), 5-1, at Bright Hockey Center—breaking a three-game winless streak in the process.
“[On Friday] everybody went into the game hoping for the win, and that didn’t happen,” senior goaltender Christina Kessler said. “[Against Colgate] that was our objective, and we’re glad we accomplished it.”
Harvard controlled play right from the beginning of the game, outshooting the Raiders, 15-6, in the first frame and easily killing off an early penalty.
Fifteen minutes into the period, the Crimson got on the scoreboard. Co-captain Kathryn Farni fed a pass to junior Liza Ryabkina, who put a shot on goal. Although Colgate goalie Lisa Plenderleith stopped the initial shot, Ryabkina picked up her own rebound, skated around the net, and lifted her second shot into the high left corner.
Senior Randi Griffin was credited with the secondary assist.
It took Harvard just 29 seconds to double its lead. Raider Amanda Kirwan was whistled for tripping at 15:50 of the first, and the Crimson’s new-look power-play unit needed just seven seconds to find the back of the net.
Co-captain Cori Bassett passed the puck to junior Kate Buesser, who made a nice cross to classmate Leanna Coskren. Coskren buried the feed just inside the right post of the goal.
“I was impressed with how we came out,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We had a lot of energy, we were pretty determined and committed.”
Buesser gave the Crimson a three-goal advantage eight minutes into the second frame. Rookie center Jillian Dempsey took a pass from classmate Kelsey Romatoski and brought the puck up the left boards. Dempsey found her linemate at the right post, and Buesser tapped it in for a 3-0 lead.
After Buesser’s goal, Harvard’s offense took a back seat to a strong defensive effort. The Crimson shut down the Raiders’ attack and looked at its best on two late-period penalty kills, when Colgate could barely maintain control in its offensive zone.
“One of the things that was good today was that we backchecked hard, we handled their stretch player,” Stone said. “They had very few good chances today…Regardless of the score, we were consistent in how we played. We never took our foot off the gas.”
Harvard would add two more goals early in the third, the first coming 40 seconds into the frame. The Crimson’s first line went to work again, as Dempsey fed a pass to Buesser, who charged towards the Raider net. Buesser’s shot was pushed away, but junior Katharine Chute scooped up the rebound and slipped it past Plenderleith to make the score 4-0.
Bassett made it a five-goal advantage seven minutes later with an unassisted shot from the left faceoff circle.
Although Harvard kept the defensive pressure on, Colgate broke up Kessler’s clean sheet with less than seven minutes left in the game. Raider Krista Dermott skated the puck up the right side and beat Kessler to make the final score 5-1.
“I’m sizzling from yesterday and sizzling from them getting a goal today, because they never should have gotten a goal today,” Stone said. “But overall, I like how we played today. We did a lot of really good things, and we’ve got to keep an edge to us.”
Kessler finished the game with 21 saves as she recorded her 64th career victory, breaking the all-time school record previously held by Ali Boe ’06.
With its first win of 2010 in hand, Harvard moved into fifth place in the crowded ECAC standings—just three points out of first. But with only nine games left on the conference slate, the Crimson knows it must make every contest count.
“We pretty much played 60 minutes of hockey, which we haven’t done in a while,” Kessler said. “It was good to come away with the victory and great to come away with three points, but I think ultimately our goal was to come away with four points this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crimson wrestling hopes one day to be an elite program, but if Saturday was any indication, the squad has a long way to go. Harvard traveled to Arlington, Texas this weekend for the annual Lone Star Duals, a high-level tournament featuring some of the nation’s best programs. Unfortunately for the Crimson (2-6-1), the three teams on its slate proved too much for a depleted roster, as Harvard fell to No. 22 Arizona State, 39-12, followed by equally brutal defeats at the hands of No. 10 Oklahoma, 44-6, and Utah Valley, 40-10.
“We had guys in the lineup that weren’t accustomed to wrestling,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “It’s good that some guys are getting experience...[but] the outcome wasn’t good.”
Still, co-captain J.P. O’Connor (157 lbs.) emphasized the benefit of taking on such tough teams as the program looks to find its footing despite a slew of injuries.
“It shows us where we want to be and allows us to measure up, to see what the top guys are doing,” he said. “Ultimately, [this level] is where we want to be, but it’s frustrating not being able to put our top 10 guys on the mat.”
UTAH VALLEY 40, HARVARD 10
By the start of the Crimson’s third match, O’Connor had been relegated to the bench by an illness and freshman Tony Buxton was recovering from a concussion in the hospital, leaving Harvard little chance of keeping pace with the Wolverines (5-1). After two technical falls, two falls, and a forfeit through the first seven matches, Utah State built an insurmountable lead. Still, Harvard’s heavier wrestlers refused to end the day with a whimper.
Co-captain Louis Caputo (184 lbs.) took control of his bout, punishing Casen Aldridge with a 9-1 major decision to cap another undefeated weekend. The two-time All-American moved to third all-time on the Crimson win list with 114 victories, just one behind O’Connor.
“Louis is doing the things we all expected him to do,” O’Connor said. “He’s such a solid guy with such a solid foundation. He wrestled his butt off [Saturday] and we all...look up to that.”
Perhaps even more impressive was the effort from sophomore Spencer DeSena (285), who has made strides after a difficult rookie campaign. The second-year grappler, who had fallen in both earlier bouts Saturday, roared back to earn his first career fall and third win of the season. DeSena downed Dylan Stadel in 6:13.
“We feel that Spencers’s got a lot of talent and he just has to bring it out,” Weiss said. “We feel he can go with anybody. Hopefully with this last win he can get some momentum, because we need him to step up.”
OKLAHOMA 44, HARVARD 6
The Crimson’s second match went no better than the first. Once again, Harvard enjoyed a pair of outstanding showings in an otherwise dismal contest, as the Sooners (9-0-1) notched three falls and four technical falls. Caputo logged over three minutes of riding time as he cruised to a 7-0 decision, but once again it was a big upset—this time by rookie Steven Keith (125)—that highlighted the Crimson effort. The freshman took on fellow newcomer Jarrod Patterson and battled for a 7-4 win, surprising the 13th-ranked grappler.
“These tournaments are purely individual,” Weiss said. “With the way our qualification system works, one big win could solidify a spot at nationals. Steven beating [Patterson] made the weekend a success just for that.”
ARIZONA STATE 39, HARVARD 12
The Crimson had to hit the ground running in Arlington, as the Ivy squad found itself outmatched against a top-25 team. The Sun Devils (7-4) opened the contest with three straight falls, the most devastating of which left Buxton (141) sidelined with a concussion. Given an 18-point cushion, Arizona State was never threatened, despite forfeiting the 197-lbs. bout. The Harvard captains set a strong example for the squad, though, earning decisions in a pair of tough efforts. O’Connor (18-0) held off illness long enough to notch a 6-5 win over Te Edwards, pushing the senior to second all-time on the career wins list. Not to be outdone, Caputo kept pace with his co-captain, beginning his day with a 7-2 victory. The decision moved the Crimson standout to 11-2 on the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson women’s basketball team seemed to be five seconds and one pass away from shifting the Ivy League power dynamic.
Instead, Dartmouth’s Margaret Smith intercepted Harvard freshman Victoria Lippert’s pass.
“It was a terrible pass, a huge mistake,” Lippert said. “I’m not going to let it happen again.”
The Crimson (9-5, 0-1 Ivy) quickly fouled Smith, who had yet to score a basket in the game. But the senior found her shot at the right time, hitting two free throws to give the Big Green (5-9, 1-0 Ivy) a 45-44 victory on its home court Saturday night.
Down by 11 in the second half, Harvard rallied to make it an even game, and junior Jackie Alemany hit a lay-up to put the Crimson up by one with 50 seconds remaining in regulation.
“There were moments when we had sparks,” Lippert said. “We definitely had our chances.”
But the loss sends Harvard back to the drawing board, where the team will have to patch up the same hole that cost it in last year’s games against the Big Green—rebounding.
“We’ve got to become a better rebounding team,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Dartmouth’s 42-32 edge on the boards was especially costly given that Harvard was struggling with its shooting—something that is usually a strength for the Crimson.
“We were getting really, really good shots, and they were not falling,” Delaney-Smith said.
The game against the defending Ivy champions was Harvard’s first on the conference slate, and the sharp increase in pressure combined with the tenacity of the Big Green’s play may have gotten into the Crimson’s heads—and fingers.
“We let them rattle us a little too much,” Lippert said. “We’re going to have to maintain our composure. Sometimes, shots just fall down. We’ve got to be able to compensate with crashing the boards, getting a stop.”
Harvard saw more success in the second of these, as it held Brittney Smith, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, to six points, and the Smith sisters to a combined total of eight. But the Big Green found offense from other sources, namely Sasha Dosenko and Faziah Steen, who combined for 21 points. A Steen layup early in the second half gave Dartmouth an imposing 11-point lead.
But the Crimson’s experienced veterans turned things around from there.
Juniors Emma Markley and Jackie Alemany started the rally for Harvard, as Alemany assisted her classmate on a layup that brought the margin back within single digits.
Soon after, Alemany capitalized off of her own defensive rebound with a three-point shot.
Alemany and Markley would both finish the game with 11 boards.
Junior co-captain Christine Matera, sophomore Brogan Berry, and freshmen Lippert and Miriam Rutzen would join in on the action, allowing Harvard to even up the contest.
“[We’re strong] when we get our team chemistry,” Lippert said. “We need to jive together and communicate.”
It was fitting that the two juniors who started the rally, Alemany and Markley, capped it off for the Crimson. First, Markley hit a free-throw shot to bring Harvard within one. Less than a minute later, Alemany converted a layup that looked to be a game changer.
But the lead that the Crimson had worked all half to earn would last only 45 seconds. The Big Green used upperclassman leadership of its own to regain the lead with Margaret Smith’s foul shots.
The trip to the line temporarily secured Dartmouth’s position as top dog in the Ivy League, while Harvard turns its focus to the south as it travels to Tallahassee for a Thursday game against Florida State, ranked 12th in the nation.
“Florida State’s a great opportunity,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s win-win. We should not feel a lot of pressure.”
The loss puts even more significance on the remaining Ivy games for a Crimson team hoping to win the league and qualify for the NCAA tournament. Meanwhile, Harvard will have almost two months to prepare for its rematch against the Big Green in the final game of the regular season.
“We’re going to come out with guns blazing when we play them again,” Lippert said. “We’re going to have a real fire under us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As more of the Harvard track and field team rounds into shape this winter season, a number of individuals have seen their efforts pay off.
The Crimson returned home to compete at the Gordon Indoor Track and Tennis Center for the first time this year, posting six wins and earning an ECAC and IC4A qualification at the Harvard Invitational Saturday.
“I think [we] feel comfortable at home...with training there day after day,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “[The meet] turned out to be just what we needed—a good competition in a low-key environment.”
Although a number of distance runners continued to rest, those who did don the Harvard uniform this weekend performed well against the biggest field that the Crimson will face all season. Of the over 525 entries, six resulted in Harvard victories, three on the men’s side and three for the women.
Perhaps the most impressive performance of the day belonged to junior Darcy Wilson, whose time of 2:29.95 earned him first place in the men’s 1000-meter race, as well as an invitation to IC4As. Wilson battled until the final moment, holding off Andrew MacIsaac of Boston College by just .02 seconds.
“[Wilson] is a tough kid, he runs hard no matter what you put him in,” co-captain Jack Brady said. “That [race] was right in his wheelhouse.”
Brady continued his own dominance in the weight throw. The IC4A qualifier hurled 18.31 meters, a full .45 meters ahead of the nearest competitor and 1.91 meters farther than any other collegiate athlete. Brady also claimed third in the shot put.
“Jack Brady had a great day,” Saretsky said. “He qualified for IC4As in the weight throw and shot put and I’m really pleased with that. He had just a huge throw in the weight.”
The final Crimson winner on the men’s side was rookie Jeff Homer, who captured the 500-meter title in 1:05.29. Sophomore Jared Squires finished second in the event, but the race proved even more fruitful for the Harvard women, as the squad earned four of the top seven spots. Freshman Melissa Bellin and sophomore Lauren Leon placed third and fourth to pace the Crimson, and the two runners showed even more promise in the 400. Bellin and Leon teamed with sophomore Shannon Conway and freshman Jasmine Cho to win the 4x400-meter relay by over two seconds, in 4:00.58.
“It was a real good race for them,” Saretsky said. “We put together four strong legs and that group’s training has been going well. They will continue to get better and better and it will be a lot of fun to see how they match up in the Ivy League.”
Including the two rookies who propelled the relay team, Harvard’s first-years provided a tremendous boost to the squad on Saturday.
Freshmen Ashtynn Baltimore and Olivia Weeks won the 60-meter hurdles and triple jump, respectively, while classmates Sydnie Leroy and Meghan Ferreira took second in the pole vault and third in the 60-meter hurdles.
Baltimore’s time of 8.80 seconds qualified her for ECACs, while Weeks claimed her first victory at the collegiate level.
“Anytime we have freshmen winning events is great,” Brady said. “It can be tough sometimes for guys jumping right in...but this [meet] was one of those stepping stones. Everyone is doing really well.”
But regardless of class year, Crimson competitors up and down the roster enjoyed strong performances. Junior Dina Emde finished second in the women’s high jump—first among collegiate athletes—at 1.65 meters, with freshman Mary Hirst just behind her in third.
On the men’s side, junior Sean Gil and sophomore Tyler Funk placed second in the pole vault and high jump, respectively, and rookie Kenneth Wan Kan posted a pair of solid showings, finishing third in the long jump and triple jump.
With so many outstanding efforts, Brady showed excitement that for the first time in his career, Harvard can boast about its depth.
“When I was a freshman we didn’t even have sprinters,” Brady said. “It’s exciting to see everyone get out there. They’re competing and contributing, which is really good.”

University President Drew G. Faust has held plenty of titles over the decades: professor, dean, bestselling author, "Chainsaw Drew." But The Drew Gilpin Faust Fan Club reminds us that she has one other, often overlooked role—celebrity.
For the past two years, an anonymous critic has been making DGF sightings her mission, posting to this mock fan blog under the charged pseudonym Grimke, taken from the 19th-century intellectual Angelina Weld Grimke.
The blog is filled with commentary on Faust as fashion icon, sarcastic critiques of Harvard's foray into Allston, and clunky faux dialogue between Grimke-as-foil and a caricature of the Harvard president.
Ultimately, whether or not it's a worthwhile read, the Drew Gilpin Faust Fan Club is certainly a goldmine for DGF glamor shots.
