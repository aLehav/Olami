After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

You’ve probably heard Fifth Harmony’s “Work from Home” more than a few times by now. It’s popular. It has a beat! (And a catchy one at that.) But this song was written by women. And it’s the 21st century… women can multitask now. Yup, “Work from Home” has some pretty damn decent lyrics too. The tune contains words aplenty—97 of which happen to be identical (“work”). But this repetition in fact only serves to bolster the song’s intended takeaway: a call to neo-feminism.  
Verifying this theory, the recently released video for “Work from Home” brings women to the forefront of the workplace. The premise of the song is that a female singer is imploring her love interest (whose perspective is later represented by Ty Dolla $ign) to leave work and come home. “Work” effectively serves as a gendered double entendre of sorts. Men can do real work, whereas women can do home “work.” Make sense?
Returning to the video, we see Fifth Harmony highlighting these concepts of ninth wave feminism, gender spheres, sexual stereotyping, etc. The whole scene takes place on a construction site—blazingly hot from the looks of it!—full of men in hard hats with bulging muscles. The women of Fifth Harmony appear on set as well. Beneath their stunningly tousled tresses, they wear construction chic leotards that are about as appropriate for manual labor, as, well, women. But the futility of their clothing proves irrelevant; luckily the women’s role on this construction site is simply to dance on bulldozers and just generally distract the guys.
Is this a metaphor for life? Hard to tell. Luckily, the rest of the album, “7/27,” will be released next month with maybe more answers. But for now, the new “Work From Home” video just brushes the surface of many culturally relevant and intellectually mystifying issues, such as the hidden sex appeal of construction sites and the cute-looking distraction that is womanhood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Like an old friend back from far away, the return of “Gilmore Girls” is unexpected but welcome news. For those of us who can credit this show for our early-onset coffee addiction, our inexplicable desire to attend Harvard (why would Rory choose Yale?), and our worries that we’re not close enough to our mothers, “Gilmore Girls: Seasons” is not just unexpected but exhilarating.
As soon as the news arose, endless articles suddenly sprung up speculating about the plot, characters’ lives, and even the lines of dialogue. Speculation became even more acute as pictures from the revival appeared and the craze for spoilers intensified. This obsessive need to know more is not something alien, as has been seen with countless beloved television shows. Perhaps the better question is not how this phenomenon occurs but why it does. Why do people need to know more about details not connected to their lives?
Maybe it’s loneliness that causes this craze. After all, when real people fail us, there are always fabricated characters on the screen in front of us to fill the void (in fact, to some these substitutes may even be an improvement). So when a show or season ends, the feeling is like being ripped apart from loved ones and left wondering if they’ll ever come back. In “Game of Thrones,” they definitely won’t. Luckily, in “Gilmore Girls” there are no planned deaths—or so we hope. Regardless, the return of the show means the filling of the void, so it is only natural to wonder if these almost familial characters have changed after the hiatus.
However, for most people, loneliness is not the main problem. No, the craze for spoilers goes deeper. All of us are forced to wait in traffic, for college admissions, to shower— the list goes on: Waiting is an unpleasant part of existence. But while people cannot displace the cars in front of them, coerce admissions officers, or push roommates out of the shower, television spoilers offer rare occasions to escape impatience with relatively few repercussions beyond an angry fan or two. Imagine reading a spoiler as a rebellion against humanity’s fate to wait. Finding spoilers is our chance to take control of fate. It is the one chance to stick it to the man and refuse to wait. It certainly sounds like more fun than actually following the rules.
As each new speculative article over “Gilmore Girls” or any other show arises, it is tempting to join in and dedicate hours of free time to investigate the lives of characters that never existed and likely never will. It seems to be the perfect occupation for a rebel without a cause. But alas, we’ll always end up waiting anyway. As this season ends, we are only left waiting for another show to obsess over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Peter L. Galison, science always extends past the laboratory. Galison—a professor in Harvard’s departments of physics and history of science, director of the University’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and a documentary filmmaker—often works across media and disciplines. His research, exhibitions, and films have explored the intersections between art and science; between material culture and theoretical discourse; and between the technicalities of scientific research and its real effects on the way people understand and live in the world around them.
Science and art have long been parallel interests in his life, Galison says. “Lots of people in my family... paint and sculpt, and that’s been part of the world that I came up in. I was interested in photography and film especially, so I began playing around with film in high school,” he says. “But I didn’t really see a way to connect the kind of film that I was interested in and science because most of the science films that I knew were much more oriented toward pedagogy [and] teaching, rather than film as a medium of more expressive ambition.”
Galison found inspiration while teaching at Stanford in the 1980s when he saw Jon Else’s 1980 documentary on the Manhattan Project, “The Day After Trinity.” “[Else’s film] was not so much [presented] as a triumph of technology or the race to the atomic bomb or the history of World War II, but really more as a kind of moral and political exploration of what it meant to think about these issues,” Galison says. He began looking for ways to work in film with his own research on the scientific and ethical debates surrounding the hydrogen bomb. Collaboration with colleagues led to his first film, the 2000 documentary “Ultimate Weapon: The H-Bomb Dilemma.”
Galison, however, says that he believes film’s potential extends further than simply its power to communicate the results of scientific research. “What interests me isn’t so much film as a means of popularizing science, though it can do that and a lot of people now learn through visual means. What interests me much more is using film as a way of exploring and learning about the development, current state, and future of science,” he says. “So for example, when you write about a laboratory or the kind of work that’s being done there, or land that’s been affected in some environmental way, or questions of food or agriculture, or of nuclear contamination, or chemicals, or changes in global warming, a lot of what you need to understand is about scale. It’s about understanding how these things affect people, in a very visceral and immediate way. Film has a way of making particularities vivid in a really striking way.”
Since he began teaching at Harvard in 1992, Galison has been involved in building new curricular spaces in which the arts and academic disciplines can intersect. Every other year for the past 15 years, he has co-taught a course called “Filming Science” with Robb Moss, filmmaker and chair of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, with whom Galison has also collaborated on two documentaries. “That course is a mix of the history and philosophy of documentary film, with screenings of films, such as historically important documentaries that have to do with science, technology, and medicine,” he says. “At the same time, it’s a making course, and every student produces a six- to nine-minute film where they work with a particular laboratory or medical site or robotics lab or museum.” With Harvard professor of visual arts and anthropology Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Galison also directs Critical Media Practice, a secondary field in which Harvard doctoral candidates from across the graduate schools can pursue projects in film, audio, and other media that extend their academic scholarship beyond a traditional written dissertation.
Galison says that he believes this kind of interdisciplinary exploration has the potential to deepen both students’ understanding of their own fields and of the means they have to communicate their findings with others. “My dream is to have people begin to think that there are many ways that you can express and get at and explore different things,” he says. “You can use material culture [and] objects, you can use writing, you can use filmmaking, you can use audio or podcasts. You can get at these things in different ways, choosing the means that are most appropriate to what you’re after.”
He adds that he would like to see further integration of creative production with academic scholarship at Harvard. For Galison, the new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration, with its collaboration with the A.R.T., offers a model for other programs. “We now have a set of stepping stones that go from beginning undergraduate to advanced undergraduate to graduate, all the way up to professional-level theater,” he says. “It’s not so much building giant new buildings and museums, but more supporting the steps that would allow you to enter a field as a total beginner and move through it up through phases to where you have extremely strong prospects in the arts.” He cautioned, however, that Harvard should maintain its liberal arts educational philosophy. “I don’t think we’re ever going to be running a film school, a professional-level film school, but I don’t think that’s really what our strength is. I think Harvard’s strength is in the integration of the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences.”

From filmmaking components in courses in the History of Science Department to stepped-up offerings in jazz composition in the Music Department, adding artistic practice to academic curricula has been a common concern across the University in recent years. In Visual and Environmental Studies, however, creative production has formed an integral part of the academic curriculum since the department’s founding in 1968. Yet even within VES, the relationship between studio practice and critical and academic studies has evolved significantly and continues to change today. The Crimson sat down with Matt Saunders, who received a B.A. from VES in 1997 and is now an assistant professor in the department, to learn more about the program’s past, present, and possible futures.
Saunders, who is also a practicing artist working in painting, photography, and film, explains that his own studies in VES coincided with the reorientation of the curriculum away from studies of human interaction with the built and natural environments toward more studio-focused coursework. “A decision was made in the early ’90s to collaborate more with the [Graduate School of Design] and to beef up the studio side, and that really happened when I was a student,” he says. “Now that relationship of studio art to the rest of the department and to the University has matured and normalized, to some extent. It was much more like an art school, I think, for me, than it is now.”
He adds that he sees both advantages and disadvantages to this more normalized relationship. “To some extent, [VES] was an amazingly energetic place [in the 1990s] partly because it felt a little bit outside of Harvard,” he says. “But people come to Harvard for all kinds of reasons, and figuring out how work [in VES] would interact with somebody’s larger arc is really important.”
Saunders says that throughout the department’s history, new faculty have instituted different balances between instruction in technical, medium-specific skills and exploration of creative practice as a form of knowledge with broader applications. “One of the implications built into calling the department ‘Visual Studies’ and not ‘Art’ is a sense of study,” he says. “Our department was framed as the liberal arts version of an art department: doing hands-on projects as a way to teach broader principles, very much in the way that a liberal arts education is formed.” He adds that he brings this concern for balance to his own teaching. “I see a big part of my classes as teaching making as a language... It’s about learning how to use the grammar and the materials and finding your way to speak through it,” he says.
This spring, Saunders is teaching the sophomore tutorial in VES as well as a course on the body in art called “Conceptual Figure.” He says that he designs courses with the aim of serving both concentrators and students from other disciplines. “Even in the five years that I’ve been here, I feel like I’ve seen some really powerful work coming from people who are not concentrators, and I think that it’s had an influence on the other work that they’ve done,” he says. “Someone who is now working for Google, for example—she was doing computer science, but I think that in her two courses with me she was really engaged with questions of visualization and coding, both in terms of making images but also in terms of information and disrupting structures.”
Saunders says that he believes retaining a dedicated faculty for studio practice remains important. To be able to make a meaningful film rather than write an essay as the final project for a class, for example, requires an investment of time in understanding the possibilities of film as an expressive medium. “As one of my film colleagues here [has said], you don’t say you’ll write a paper in Japanese without first studying Japanese. There are aspects of putting something like that together that seem straightforward until you try to do it,” he says. “That’s why it’s important that some of those things have a curricular home as well.”
Looking forward, Saunders says that he hopes VES will be able to expand to include more graduate programs beyond its existing Ph.D. program in Film and Visual Studies. “I think it’s essential for the University to keep up with the world,” he says. “More than ever, the visual arts are integrated with all of the other arts, with the economy. The growth of the Internet has been a growth of visual culture above anything else. There are ways in which I feel that our culture is more visual than it’s ever been…. It’s important for the University to keep pace with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Held every Thursday afternoon in Lowell Lecture Hall, Theater, Dance, and Media 149DA: “Argentine Tango: Culture, Music, and the Dance” is one of many classes offered for the first time this year in the newly established Theater, Dance, and Media concentration. The creation of this concentration has allowed this and other courses with performance components to come to life. "[The concentration] was looking for courses that in an exciting new way combined theory with practice to give students studio training in an art form to which they dedicate a semester of study,” says course instructor Thomas Wisniewski. “It was the perfect opportunity.”
Each meeting of TDM149DA features both practical and theoretical exercises. Classes open with lecture and discussion on a topic of the week—from early 20th century immigration to cultural history to tango dance and music history—relating to Argentina. The second half of the course serves as a dance practicum, or dance lab. “The whole idea [was to] give a training in tango salon, in social tango dancing, over the course of a semester,” Wisniewski says.
On Thursday, April 21, however, a scheduled change disrupted the regular rhythms of TDM149DA. Rather than Wisniewski himself, renowned Argentinian pianist Pablo Ziegler took the stage. Ziegler, a Latin Grammy-winning, world-touring figure in the modern composition and tango music worlds, had been invited to teach a masterclass for the concluding session of TDM149DA in collaboration with the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. Ziegler—referred to as “Maestro Ziegler” by all present, a sign of utmost respect in musical circles—was born in Argentina in 1944, where he graduated from the Buenos Aires Music Conservatory and established himself as a solo pianist, jazz ensemblist, and composer. His meteoric rise to musical fame began in 1978, when he joined the quintet led by Astor Piazzolla, known as the founder of nuevo tango, a new musical style based on traditional Argentinian tango that incorporated jazz and classical influences.
Though TDM149DA had featured several guest lecturers over the past semester, for some students Ziegler’s visit marked the apex of the program. “Pablo Ziegler's masterclass was by far the best event because we learned and talked about him so much in the past that it felt surreal to see him talk and play in person,” Claudia D. Oh ’17 says.
The guest session began with Wisniewski’s interview of Ziegler, in which the latter discussed his work, his life, and his passion for nuevo tango, a vibrant musical hybrid of American jazz and traditional tango. Starting with his earliest musical beginnings—his father, a tango violinist, introduced him to the music by taking him to a concert at the age of nine—and tracing the 60-some year musical journey to today, Ziegler touched on the various musical ensembles he had led and the figures from whom he drew inspiration. He referred often to his mentor and collaborator Astor Piazzolla, who was during his lifetime one of the world’s most prominent tango composers. Ziegler credits the late Piazzolla with his musical training, the development of his style, and his roots in the tango tradition. The discussion with Ziegler was punctuated by short clips of recordings from Ziegler’s past performances of his own and Piazzolla's work.
Following the interview, student performers Justin A. Dower ’17, Eli J. Kresta ’16, and Brian W. Ventura ’16, all accompanied by pianist Dylan Marcaurele ’16, sang, played alto saxophone, and sang, respectively. Ziegler’s comments focused on specific technical elements—more legato, more nuanced accents of downbeats, phrasing carried over the barline—that would produce the unique sound qualities of nuevo tango. “I was rather nervous going into the class because I’d never before played in a master class, and these two musicians are really spectacular,” Dower said. “[But] they were genuinely interested in helping me learn to better play in the style of tango, and everything they said was both kind and constructive.”
Wisniewski says the idea for this collaboration was first born last September, when Marcela V. Ramos—the program manager for ARTS@DRCLAS, an initiative at the David Rockefeller Center focused on fostering Latin American visual and performing arts at Harvard—asked him about potential artists for the spring concert series. His response was simple: “Pablo Ziegler.” Months later, that idea became reality, culminating in Ziegler and guitarist Claudio Ragazzi’s joint concert on April 20 at the Villa Victoria Center for the Arts and the student master class at Lowell Lecture Hall.
The students themselves come primarily from social science, science, and humanities concentrations, though many have backgrounds in theater, music, or dance as well. Yet not all students have formal training in the performing arts, and Wisniewski says experience is not a necessity for TDM149DA. “I think you have to find a way to make music and music theory accessible to students without a formal knowledge of music…. I have various sets of exercises [including] hearing the beat, reproducing it with your body,” Wisniewski said.
His students seem to agree. “I think it's so cool that such opportunities are afforded even to students who aren't concentrating in Theater, Dance, and Media or music,” Kresta said. Physical elements like walking, snapping, clapping, and of course dancing, are embedded in the course curriculum in order to increase students’ comprehension of the subject matter—tango’s history, tango’s performance aspects, and the tango culture—itself. The class concludes with a group tango: one step, two step, to its own nuevo beat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The website of Harvard’s creative writing program features a list of frequently asked questions, most of which follow a common theme: anxious students asking,“How many courses should I apply to? What is the creative writing faculty looking for in an application? What happens if I don’t get accepted into any of the courses I apply for?” The selection process is indeed notoriously competitive, and relatively few students will be granted admission. But those lucky and skilled enough to earn a slot have a rich world of academic and personal growth to look forward to. Students across a wide variety of concentrations and experience levels hone their craft with renowned professors, learning about the nuances of screenplays, poetry, fiction, and more.
Each course involves a slightly different structure: Some classes ask students to write something for every class, while others require only occasional written pieces. Some classes provide specific, regular assignments, while others are much more open-ended. Format aside, the workshops share a philosophical commitment to positive individual artistic growth. “I think the role of every teacher... is to be the ideal advocate for the student work,” says Senior Lecturer Bret A. Johnston, the director of the program. “I want to create an environment both within the workshop and within the lives of the individual writers… where they feel invited to take risks, where they feel invited to challenge what they thought was possible.
Often, student feedback plays a key role in the creation of such an environment; most classes regularly have students respond to one another’s work. This process, while productive and well-intentioned, may not always be easy. “It’s kind of like birthing a child and holding it up for everyone to criticize…. [But] you slowly start to realize that everyone hates their own poems just as much as you hate yours,” says Ben D. Grimm ’18, member of a class on devotional poetry.
Besides offering helpful new perspectives, the feedback-giving process also creates a close community. Students describe their groups as fairly intimate, bonded by their investment in each other’s work. “It’s a pretty casual atmosphere. Lots of laughter,” says John P. Finnegan ’16,  former associate business manager at The Crimson, of his fiction writing workshop.
Consistently small class sizes facilitate this closeness: Most workshops have around 12 students, a number that allows for plenty of rapport and attention. Still, some students express regret over the selectivity that such sizes mandate. The excellent experience of a workshop, some say, should be available to as many people as possible. But the logistical issues prove intractable: Large class sizes could weaken the trust between participants, limit individual attention, and give each student less room to participate. Furthermore, the student could confuse the feedback itself. “If it was a class of 20, you wouldn’t be able to put your work out there as often. There would also be just too many voices in the room. Even with just 12 other people, people have very differing opinions…. Trying to sort through that is a challenge itself,” Finnegan says.
Grimm expounded on the problem of varying tastes and large numbers. “Every now and then, you’ll get a poem back and four people have underlined the same line and one of them will say ‘I don’t understand this,’ one will say ‘this is the best line ever,’ and two will say, ‘I hate this, get rid of it,” Grimm says. According to Johnston, there are no plans to change class sizes, and in fact, the program is larger and more open than it has ever been.
And the classes remain available to students of all kinds, not merely English concentrators interested in becoming professional writers. The courses contain pre-med students, religion concentrators, and so on, in addition to a handful of graduate students and cross-registered students. Such diversity can be valuable for creating an interesting community, and it also allows students to balance their interests and schedules. “Taking [an intermediate poetry workshop] as a pre-med has been really valuable to me because it is so different from my science-heavy load…. it’s a great change of pace and a great way to connect with other side of myself,” Rory R. Sullivan ’16 says.
Furthermore, the different programs can interact in complex and useful ways. “I write a lot about… health and medicine and the body. They’re really personal things and cool things to write about. And being a good doctor—-there’s a lot of communication and empathy that goes into it,” says Sophia M. Emmons-Bell ’18, who concentrates in human developmental and regenerative biology.
Sometimes these intersections can even lead to important personal realizations. Working on a nonfiction essay about his need to take photographs, writer Will Li ’19 noticed his own tendency to worry about forgetting certain memories and even traced his feelings back to the passing of his mother. He said that the workshops might offer their most valuable product in these instances of understanding. “That’s why I love writing so much,” he says. “Those realizations are possible.”

“Films that can make you laugh and make you cry are what I want to make,” says visual and environmental studies concentrator Renee E. Zhan ‘16. Most senior theses do not quite do that. Then again, most senior theses are not an animated film about a boy and a bird living together, like Zhan’s hand-drawn solo project, “Hold Me (Ca Caw Ca Caw).”
“The film is done in a traditional 2D animation style,” Zhan says. “It’s moving foregrounds on still backgrounds. The moving foregrounds I drew digitally in Photoshop and the backgrounds are hand-painted watercolors. They’re composited together to form the final image.” More than 11 minutes long, “Hold Me” has 12 of those individually made frames per second.
At first, Zhan felt intimidated by the sheer size and complexity of her creative thesis. “In the real world, even animated shorts, ideally you have a team working on them. So trying to cram it all in on my own was difficult,” Zhan says. “You’re responsible for every element, from design to script to picture to sound.” Still, despite the difficulty of working alone on a project, she says there are some benefits as well. “I’ve had some experience with live-action filmmaking, and it’s a very different beast,” she says. “It’s really great to work in a team, but for me it’s very overwhelming as well. I sort of like being able to just sit down at my desk and do everything from there and not have to worry about the logistics of lugging around cameras and getting people to let you shoot in your space.”
Besides, Zhan was not entirely alone making the film. She attributes the finished product in part to the guidance and support of her thesis advisor and longtime teacher Ruth Lingford and to the feedback of her classmates. “What I’m doing is an independent thing, as far as the physical production of it, but it isn’t entirely a solo thing,” she says. Zhan also cites the influence of animators Igor Kovalyov, Don Hertzfeldt, and David OReilly, characterizing Kovalyov’s work as tactile and mysterious. “[Hertzfeldt and OReilly] are so crudely funny but also so touching,” she says. “That’s the feeling I want to hit with my own work.”
“Hold Me” begins with a nude lump of a person sitting in a living room, while a giant bird flaps ineffectually around. Over the course of the short, however, the bird begins to blur the line between woman and animal. Her relationship with the room’s other occupant becomes both sexual and familial, to unsettling effect. “The story is about this relationship between this human boy and this large bird and their imprisonment in this house,” Zhan says. “They’re imprisoned not only by walls and by boarded-up windows but also by routine, by a relationship that they can’t or don’t want to get out of.”
Is the human a boy, though? He proves almost as ambiguous as the anthropomorphic bird. In some parts the bird feeds him regurgitated maggots like a child, but in others there seems to be a middle-aged note to this hairy, overweight, sex-crazed man lounging around the house naked.
The short film is graphically explicit. It is also grim in places—the egg-child of the boy and the bird ends up eaten, and the bird cooks herself in an oven by the end. The content is shocking, especially for animation. “I think that animation… often is seen as a medium for children. Pixar and Disney are making beautiful, incredible films, but I think that animation can be so much more than that,” Zhan says. “It’s limited by its audience when we think of its audience as children…. I think you can be graphic with animation, because when live action is graphic, you want to turn away. It’s hard to watch. But because there’s a disconnect in animation––because it’s drawings––you don’t turn away, and in that way you can show more.”
Befitting this darker tone, the short is drawn in bleak black and white—except for splashes of sunny yellow. “Deciding to make my film black and white… it took a while for me to commit to that,” Zhan says. “I love movies that are in black and white for no reason. I think there’s something really beautiful about just the minimalism of that. Eggs feature in a large part of my film, and they’re yellow, they have to be yellow. So I just decided it would be black and white and yellow.”
“Hold Me” builds on anthropomorphic characters from Zhan’s previous animated shorts, both the suicidal pigeon of “Pidge” and the horny praying mantis high schooler of “In Sex Ed.” But Zhan’s animal characters are not simply humans by another name. “I think a trope in animated films is anthropomorphic animals—animals behaving like humans. What I wanted to do was have a bird who behaved like a bird,” Zhan says. Perhaps that’s a takeaway of the film—not, as in most anthropomorphizing accounts, that animals can be just like us, but rather that we can be just like animals.

The Harvard Art Museums serve a unique purpose on campus: While they are an exhibition facility open to the public, they also contribute to education at Harvard. Jessica L. Martinez ’95, the Museums’ director of academic and public programs, works right at the intersection of these two tracks. Assisting professors in making use of the resources at the Art Museums to help teach their classes, she organizes special public exhibitions in collaboration with faculty members as well as class visits. This week, she talked to The Harvard Crimson about the details of her work.
The Harvard Crimson: What kind of courses typically collaborate with the Art Museums, and how do the collaborations work?
Jessica L. Martinez: We’ve been collaborating with faculty across the campus. We have a lot of classes that are in the General Education program, humanities colloquiums, freshman seminar programs, and an Expository Writing program. For departments, we have frequent visits from African and African American Studies, from Anthropology, Classics, Comparative Literature, Germanic Languages and Literatures, History.  Of course History of Art and Architecture is our closest faculty partner, along with the Classics Department, and they make great use of the collection every week. But also [we have] History and Literature, History of Science, Human Evolutionary Biology [and Molecular and] Cellular Biology.
THC: Can you tell us how the biology departments get involved?
JM: There was a terrific Gen Ed course called [Trees, Forests and Global Change]. They would actually come to our conservation lab and look at the wood that made up the back of impressionist paintings to look at wood anatomy…. Sometimes faculty come to us with a syllabus and some learning objective and say: ‘What might we be able to experience within the space of the Harvard Art Museums?’ [We] work with faculty to say: ‘What is it that you want to do? Is it that you want a section conversation to happen in one of the collections  galleries? Would you like to select works that actually exist in storage that we can bring out specifically for your class?’ We can bring out single works, make juxtapositions, or even develop an argument with and through original works of art. Some faculty want to think about the data that this museum holds, or show off their data in inventive ways, so they spend a lot of time in our Lightbox Gallery, a place for innovative teaching with data. Or they might want to think about problem solving in the space of the museum. How did artists create their work? What were the techniques, processes, materials they used? Some want their students to have a hands-on experience, and we typically do that in our Materials Lab.
THC: Some faculty members set up exhibitions in the galleries as part of courses. Have any of them been particularly successful?
JM: We have four University galleries... One of them is the University Teaching Gallery, and this is the space for History of Art and Architecture classes... Every semester so far we’ve had two HAA classes where the students get to dive into the materials and see the works they are studying in this gallery space. The public is invited to as well, to have new kinds of conversation. And the faculty, of course, pull up works that perhaps our curators haven’t... and bring their new perspectives. It’s of course a gain for everybody who visits the museum, but for the museum it’s another way that we get to learn more about works in our care, through the faculty research and the student work on them.
THC: The Art Museums are going to have a new Bauhaus [an art school in Germany famous for architecture] exhibition, and part of the focus will be the Bauhaus founders’ involvement at Harvard. Will there be any collaboration between the Art Museum and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on this exhibition?
JM: We are hoping this will be a campus-wide initiative. We are already speaking with faculty members across campus to think about ways in which they might teach at this exhibition or if we can collaborate on programs and other research initiatives. We are already starting, even though the exhibition isn’t until 2019. What is terrific about a museum is that we have some time to plan, so we can have deep conversations with partners both on campus—so faculty, for their teaching and research, also student groups, and our neighbors and friends in Cambridge and Greater Boston as well. We can also convene people in different disciplines... all together around original works of art, and we can work together to see what can happen uniquely on Harvard’s campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not often that you sit down to interview someone about his senior thesis only to have him tell you that it’s not a written thesis at all.
“The end project is a virtual reality experience,” says Daniel A. Citron ’16, an inactive Crimson multimedia editor, with an exuberantly friendly smile slowly spreading across his face. Citron is wearing a plaid shirt and headphones around his neck, and everything about him, from his well-paced gait to his even speech, is comforting—an invitation to interact. He’s the type of person that manages to be artsy while still being approachable. It’s no surprise, then, that Citron would choose an approachable art form like virtual reality for his senior thesis.
VR, short for virtual reality, has shifted from an evanescent technology of the future to a looming presence in Silicon Valley. Facebook itself has invested in the technology, purchasing the VR headset maker Oculus Rift. Meanwhile, HTC is also developing its own version of the technology, and Microsoft has already made an Xbox-compatible headset. Through these headsets, it’s possible to climb Mt. Everest, maintain robots, or even enrich a gaming experience. So prevalent is VR in the common consciousness that NPR and The New Yorker reported on it—breathless praise alternating with puzzlement about how this new technology will change the future.
While others dream of technological utopias, Citron sees a different potential for the headset: storytelling. It is this human focus, combined with the uncharted territory of a new medium, that lies at the center of his thesis. Citron’s piece, a 16 minute virtual reality experience centered on a girl named Sophia, expresses much of the promise and anxiety inherent in a new technology.  As Sophia navigates her two worlds—one “real” and one VR—she must choose between the seductively perfect and the solidly permanent. In this world within a world (within a world), Sophia becomes something of a proxy.
The directly interactive nature of VR created unexpected differences with other mediums: “It’s far enough away from some of the other storytelling media we’ve had… that a lot of the rules of film or theater don’t really apply anymore,” he says. As Citron worked on his thesis—programming, storyboarding, and brainstorming—he faced many of these dilemmas. “You completely lose framing,” Citron says, “which means that it’s harder to give perspective on topics, on characters, etc., because it’s not all contained within a neat frame.”
The multi-layered nature of this narrative shifts the traditional boundaries in experiencing art: “While I really want to make sure that the audience understands the story, it’s important that they still feel a sense of agency, that they’re not being forced to look at anything,” Citron says. As a result, Citron had to come up with a whole repertoire of interesting techniques to “nudge” the viewer in the right direction.
The opening scene of the VR experience takes place in a piano bar, and while the viewer can move his or her head in any direction to see a 360 view of the room, there is still an underlying story that, in order to be coherent, requires consistent engagement with the scene. Prompting the viewer to engage requires an understanding of how humans interact with virtual environments but also with real ones. “One of the ways that we in reality are cued towards where something is or where we should be looking or what should be drawing our attention is the fact that we can hear, ‘That is behind us, that is here, etc.’ and when we turn our head that sound is now in front of us,” he says.
Using this insight, Citron directs the viewer’s attention to the front of the room using precise lighting and sound effects. In each of the worlds that Sophia explores, Citron strives to create a sense of consistency, programming each virtual environment in a way that is most conducive for the narrative. While this aspect of the project was highly technical, Citron insists that it’s not his focus. “I really got excited about virtual reality because it kind of combines a lot of my interests into one medium, in that I have a background in film, and a background in interaction design, and this is kind of the perfect culmination of both of those parts because it’s storytelling but also enabling interaction,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His classmates can find him listening to music almost everywhere he goes, whether it be in his dorm room, on the way to class, or even in the Pforzheimer House dining hall. But English concentrator Obasi R. Shaw ’17, an avid fan of rap will do more than just listen to beats. He’ll write his own lyrics to them too, as part of his creative thesis on the African-American experience.
Frustrated by the tendency to divide race relations by time period, Shaw argues that the issues of today are inextricably linked to those of the past. “I feel like we compartmentalize our understanding of race relations in America into five distinct categories. There’s slavery, reconstruction, Jim Crow, civil rights, and now. And I think that because we make these sharp categorical distinctions, it’s hard for us to see how… violence now is influenced by housing policies in the ‘60s, and how different times intersect and how nothing's really distinct,” Shaw says. For him, his creative thesis is all about illuminating all sides of black stories. He draws inspiration from leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., even going as far to incorporate some lines of the “I Have a Dream” speech in one of his songs, “Understand.” Shaw will have more chances to display this sort of creativity when undertaking the task of writing a whole rap album based on African-American history. Each song takes about eight to 10 hours of writing, not including recording time at the Quad Sound Studios. Despite the time commitment, Shaw already has four potential thesis songs composed.
Shaw loves listening to the works of Kendrick Lamar, Public Enemy, and Chance The Rapper; however, it wasn’t just his taste in music that got him started with writing lyrics. In fact, despite having listened to rap for quite some time, Shaw only started creating his own music last summer. “The reason why I started rapping was because of a kid that I mentor at a summer camp who is in love with rap and wants to be a rapper,” Shaw says. “He would constantly challenge me to rap battles, and so I would entertain him. And I started to like enjoy the art form myself after a summer of doing that.”
Shaw also believes that his experiences with both English classes at Harvard and extracurricular creative writing aided him in his growth as a musical artist. He took Advanced Fiction with Jennifer Gilmore last semester and has participated in the month-long novel-writing challenge NaNoWrimo four times. “All those different kinds of writing inform each other,” Shaw says.
When Shaw is asked to point to some of his favorite lines in his songs, [he pulls up the second verse of “Understand,” which uses a beloved children’s classic as a metaphor for black experiences, much in the fashion of a short story: “When the drugs got us hooked like the myth from Peter Pan / Getting high off the dust hoping we never land / Ain’t our own fault we lose our boys in the end.” He highlights the wordplay in the last line, how “in the end” sounds like “Indian,” alluding to the Native Americans who supposedly lived in Neverland.
But in spite of having a variety of writing skills under his belt, Shaw still feels the pressures of fitting entire storylines within a few songs. “A song is three to four minutes generally, so it’s not a lot of time to convey a whole idea,” Shaw says. “When I speak about somebody's life, I can only talk about a few key moments and try to paint a broader picture from that…. I have to try to balance getting as much exposition into those few words as possible while also trying to tell a very interesting and engaging story.”
Despite these challenges, for Shaw, rap is still the best way to represent black voices for this creative thesis. “Rap is a historically black form of art, and if I want to tell a story of black people, the most appropriate art form is to use their art form—to use our art form,” he says. “I feel like a rapped project kind of conveys the black culture more than a set of poetry would or a even, like, a movie…. This is one of the very few forms of art that black people can claim as their own.”

It’s a Wednesday afternoon, and classroom B150, tucked away in a corner of the Northwest Building basement, buzzes with energy. Inside the room, students furiously type on their laptops, flip through their worksheets—an interesting blend of colors, chords, and mathematical notation—and consult each other for advice.
“I’m a math major,” George D. Torres ’17 says, “but this is not stuff they teach in the Math Department or the Applied Math Department. This is the stuff that a math major wants to learn, but he can’t.” Torres, a joint concentrator in physics and mathematics, is referring to the coursework of Applied Mathematics 141r: Computational Music Theory. Described as “an inquiry based and hands on exploration” that combines “mathematics, computer programming and aesthetics” in the course catalog, the class seeks to present an intersection between two fields typically seen as operating under different categories: music and math.
Yet Applied Mathematics 141r is only a window into an interdisciplinary area of study within the department that, while small and rife with its own challenges, continues to thrive on campus. The music track of the applied math concentration brings together computation, mathematical modeling, and music theory and composition to produce a uniquely quantitative study of what has traditionally been perceived to be a humanist field. Despite limited course offerings, difficulties in striking the balance between and synthesizing the subject matter of two vastly disparate fields, and the trials of navigating a still-young industry, each year the applied math/music track imparts upon its graduates a perspective, skill set, and breadth of knowledge that serve to redefine Harvard’s liberal arts system for the silicon age.
In the age of big data and the money that often accompanies it, it’s not surprising that the number of undergraduates concentrating in applied mathematics nearly tripled (from 101 to 275) between 2008 and 2014. The meteoric increase is hardly characteristic of a typical concentration at Harvard—but then again, applied mathematics has never been a typical concentration. Rather than remaining bound to the same general topics, concentrators are required to tailor their study to their own interests by choosing one of a variety of fields to which to apply their quantitative knowledge.  Many students gravitate toward popular, pragmatic areas of application like economics, computer science, and mechanical engineering; others, breaking from the mold, choose less obvious fields like linguistics, architecture, and government. While the first set of areas of application consistently draws large numbers of concentrators, the second set can in many years see none at all.
Among the less conventional areas of application, however, one subject stands out for the relative reliability with which it attracts students: music. Both Christopher H. Rycroft, director of undergraduate studies for applied mathematics, and his predecessor Michael P. Brenner, professor of applied mathematics and applied physics, confirm that the track has for years seen continued interest from the student body, producing a small number of graduates almost every year.
These students flock to applied mathematics/music for a myriad of reasons. For some, it’s a way to study two disparate fields of interest without accumulating the numerous requirements that adding a joint concentration or secondary field would entail. “I was able to take these music classes that I otherwise probably wouldn’t have taken, because if I did, like, applied math/CS [plus a secondary in music], the course load would have just been so difficult for me,” says Jiho Kang ’16, an applied math/music concentrator.
For others, like Alicia J. Young ’17, it’s a matter of flexibility. “I’m glad I [concentrated in applied mathematics/music] just because I have so much variety. I’m taking classes in the Math Department, the Stat Department, the Computer Science Department, potentially the Ec Department. I get to have classes from all over the departments, and they are all good at making me think about math in general and how it is applied to music,” she says.
And yet for others still, it’s an opportunity to unite the two subjects, to solve musical problems like teaching a computer program to read and digitize handwritten sheet music or to characterize musical phenomena using numerical models. The structure of the applied mathematics concentration provides plenty of room for students to accomplish this task. In addition to their foundational classes, concentrators are required to select five courses that meld, to a significant degree, quantitative study with their chosen area of application. Depending on the specific student, such classes can cover material such as population genetics, decision theory, and natural language processing. Those who choose music as their focus field are able to pursue topics ranging from Schenkerian analysis to tonal counterpoint—but of their options, the course perhaps most archetypal of the applied math/music track is Applied Mathematics 141r.
Computational Music Theory is the culmination of years of work from Elizabeth R. Chen, a lecturer on applied mathematics at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—work that she says she started as an undergraduate. With encouragement from Brenner, at the time director of undergraduate studies for the Applied Math Department, she hosted a seminar on the topic for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows over the summer; its positive reception led to the course being approved for undergraduate students for the following school year.
Two years later, Chen is now leading the second iteration of the class, and as she tells it, both her approach and the subject matter are hardly ordinary. “The way I teach the theory is a bit unusual than how most people teach [it],” Chen says. “And I just don’t mean the pedagogy. I also mean the course material is a bit unusual.”
In fact, Applied Math 141r covers a wide breadth of mathematical topics spanning pattern recognition, number theory, vector space modeling, and ratios—to name a few. The 27 students enrolled also work extensively with Mathematica, a mathematical computation software, to encode audio and build their own instruments. These various components come together to help students derive the key mathematical concepts underlying music theory. “It’s just really interesting material that we’re learning,” Ben M. Kelly ’17 says. “Especially… having learned a lot of this stuff from the music theory side of things, to now get to learn it from a mathematical standpoint is really fascinating. I see music now in a different light. I hear it in a different tone.”
Furthermore, the class eschews lectures for a seminar-style format more conducive to collaboration and critical thought. “The way that Beth approaches the class is very unique,” Caroline Teicher ’19 says. “[Chen is] against lectures…. Instead she’ll put something very strange and obscure on the board, and because we have a lot of time in this class, we’ll sit for an hour and a half or three hours to figure this problem out.”
Torres notes the degree of engagement Chen’s pedagogy demands of her students. “[The course is] incredibly self-motivated,” he says. “We try to figure things out because we ourselves are interested in figuring out something. It’s different from a lot of other math classes because it doesn’t derive things from axioms or strict rigor….”
This educational style is what attracted many to Computational Music Theory; in fact, several of those interviewed cited their love of Chen’s teaching as their reason for enrolling in the course. Others chose to take the class for its content. This latter category of students comprises not only applied mathematics concentrators within the music track—though many, such as Young and recent graduate Kara J. Lee ’15, do take the class—but also those within the department who are pursuing other focus fields; biomedical engineers; computer scientists; and even a law student.
Aron I.F. Szanto ’18, an applied mathematics concentrator interested in economics and computer science, highlights the significance of having courses that find applications in two seemingly unrelated fields—particularly when one of those fields is non-STEM. “There is a really large focus on technical sciences being applied to other technical sciences,” he says. “I think there could be a lot more of technical sciences being applied to softer sciences or softer fields. In particular, I’m a big fan of the applied math/music track because [its] students… are really the impressively interdisciplinary ones.”
In fact, students say that what ultimately makes Computational Music Theory an engaging course is its mission to truly highlight and concretize the connections between math and music. “In applied math, a lot of the emphasis is on applied, and it’s kind of ironic because you don’t see many classes like this [class] that are actually focused on the application,” Emily R. Cherkassky ’17 says. “So it’s cool that this class focuses on directly applying math to a topic.” 
Chen is leaving Harvard next year, however, and she fears for the fate of the class following her departure. “It’s hard to find people who are applied math and music. I’m actually quite worried about the future because this is my last semester here, so this course probably won’t be offered again, and I’m not sure what they’ll do,” she says. “I think they need to hire more applied math people, period.”
Indeed, according to Rycroft, there currently exist no definite plans to continue Applied Mathematics 141r in Chen’s absence. “That course is very much tied to Beth, really. She developed it. At the moment, the answer is no. People like Beth are hired for a fixed period, and we kind of have a number of people coming through there, and they may offer a number of focus topics in other areas. So we don’t know yet whether there will be anything of that flavor in the near term,” he says.
The loss of what students have described as a crucial element of the applied mathematics/music track hits particularly hard for a focus field that, according to students, faculty, and administrators alike, already suffers from a lack of course offerings. “I would say that SEAS has been a little taken aback by the growth of applied math,” Rycroft says. “Universities only move so quickly in adapting to that…. To expand a program, there’s only kind of a certain rate you can do it in terms of the number of people you have to teach it. But certainly there’s a commitment from SEAS to really grow the applied math program in terms of faculty, in terms of lecturers, and to try and expand the course offerings.”
Brenner also acknowledges the shortage of suitable classes—but in his opinion, music actually fares better than the rest of the humanities. “It’s always difficult…. It’s not like there are classes that were made for this sitting in the course catalogue,” Brenner says.  “[But] for music, MIT has classes that students that can take; and also, the music department has classes that work when put in context, and that helps. There are other areas in the humanities where you’d think it would be nice to have such things.”
Indeed, some students do opt to make the trek to MIT, where they can choose from a wider variety of courses on topics ranging from audio engineering to the physics of sound. For example, Michael Scott Cuthbert ’98, a music professor at MIT, teaches classes on music theory, music history, and computational methods of understanding musical notation. “Some of the courses ask questions about, ‘What’s a way of understanding how we extract information from musical scores or from recordings?’” he says.

Others fulfill their credits not with the mathematical modeling classes they had anticipated but rather with music theory, which counts as quantitative under the applied mathematics concentration criteria. But these courses, some of which only loosely touch upon one of the two subjects they are meant to combine, don’t necessarily fit the mold of a focus field touting the strength of its interdisciplinary learning. For instance, applied mathematics/music students have taken Music 167: Introduction to Electroacoustic Music, taught by music professor and Harvard University Studio for Electroacoustic Composition director Hans Tutschku, for concentration credit. Tutschku says, however, that the class—which teaches students to arrange, layer, and edit sounds into full-fledged musical works using technologies like Reaper, a multi-channel digital audio software—treats the scientific component only as a means of music creation rather than something to be understood for its own sake. “There’s no technical background required,” Tutschku says. “What we do in sections is teach them the use of a couple of tools…. But we don’t go into the scientific underpinnings. They don’t learn how to calculate an f(t) or something like that. They really learn the tools in order to produce something they want to write.”
Tutschku’s comments illustrate what students have indicated to be a major shortcoming of the track: Its classes often emphasize, in a binary manner, math or music as their primary focus. One serves merely to facilitate the other, rather than the two being combined in a way that truly enhances students’ understanding of both fields. “I can’t really say that I came out of this experience having a very strong intersectionality between music and math,” Kang says. “I looked at the syllabus of these [music] classes and was like, you know what, this sounds interesting because it has a lot of technological elements—but I never, like, solved a differential equation in these classes…. I like math enough that I wish [the classes] could have incorporated a little more of it. Oftentimes it felt a little separate.”
This perceived lack of synthesis between the musical and mathematical components of applied mathematics/music classes has even influenced students not to declare concentrations in the field. Benjamin S. Wetherfield ’17, for example, is involved extensively in pursuits that combine technology and music. Last semester he embarked on a Visual and Environment Studies multimedia project in which he combined music with live-processed visuals, and this summer he will be working at the Studio for Electroinstrumental Music in the Netherlands, where he says much of his time will be spent working on physical computing and programming. However, Wetherfield has opted to concentrate not in the music track of applied mathematics but rather in math with a secondary in music, in part because he has not found a true connection between the two subjects in his classes—even those that would have counted as applied mathematics/music concentration requirements.
“I don’t really see that much of a bridge in what I do. I guess I use technology a lot or use the computer a lot and things like that [when I make music], but I don’t view anything I do as applied math,” he says. “I think on a micro-level, in creating music, you’re always solving little problems that arise… and sometimes that’ll maybe be a slightly mathematical outlook or maybe a combinatorial way of approaching a music problem. But the problem’s just arisen for creative reasons. And for me, I’m unlikely to have a large-scale problem that I want to tackle using the tools of mathematics. It’d just be an ad hoc solution using any number of tools.”
Administrators within the Applied Mathematics Department recognize the disconnect between the mathematical and musical components of the track but argue that the challenge may, at the same time, actually benefit concentrators. “I’m kind of aware of the issue…. It’s something we’re very aware of and something that we’re trying to continually improve,” Rycroft says. “But I do also think… that one thing about being an applied mathematician is to really be able to communicate across disciplines, so I think that some amount of having to deal with slightly different environments is actually good.”
But it may not be for lack of trying that the Applied Mathematics Department is unable to pilot a fully integrated music track; rather, students attest to a dearth of faculty and advisers who have substantial insight into both fields. While students do praise the overall supportive atmosphere of the Applied Mathematics Department, the strength of its advising, in large part due to this scarcity, has received mixed responses.
Maura D. Church ’14, a recent graduate and applied mathematics/music concentrator, says that she found a welcoming community in her peers in the track and other similar tracks, students at MIT, and faculty members from both the Applied Mathematics and the Music Departments. “The advising was stellar, especially from the Applied Math Department,” she says. “I think they really make an effort… to give you the support you need.”
Lee, on the other hand, agrees that individuals like Brenner, who was director of undergraduate studies while she was an undergraduate, did try their best to guide her—but she says that the Applied Mathematics Department’s lack of offerings and domain knowledge in music hindered her attempts to navigate her focus field. “While the department was extremely supportive and excited... in terms of speaking to professors who really understand the intersection of applied math and music and built classes around that, that was incredibly limiting,” she says.
Her concerns are shared by current undergraduates like Kang, who considered writing a senior thesis but found ultimately that he lacked the expertise to conduct a research project of sufficient scope. “I think something that’s just really challenging is just if the concentration is going to support stuff like applied math/music… the department itself also needs to know a little more about that accompanying concentration to see whether it is a good fit,” he says. Even Church, who did write a thesis detailing an algorithm to correct rhythmic errors in commercial Optical Music Recognition software, found an adviser not in a Harvard professor but in Cuthbert, whom she met while he was at Harvard as a Radcliffe Fellow.
In any case, the absence of a full-fledged, truly cross-disciplinary quantitative music program is hardly a unique shortcoming of the Harvard Applied Math Department. The tech-music sector itself, rising on the shoulders of industry darlings like Spotify and Pandora, has certainly grown in recent years—Spotify went from half a million paid subscribers in July 2010 to 30 million in March 2016—but it has yet to reach critical mass. Job opportunities, while on the rise, remain relatively sparse, and both current students and alumni attest to the difficulty of securing employment. For example, Lee, despite prior internship experience at Spotify, Pandora, and Interscope Records, had not found a full-time position even by the time she graduated the College. And Kang received an offer to intern at Spotify during the summer after his junior year—only to be informed as his start date approached that the company no longer had the funds necessary to support him.
Regardless of the internal challenges that the applied mathematics/music track and its students face, responses to its real-world applicability and utility outside the Harvard bubble have been optimistic. Now graduates, both Church and Lee have found the skills they have derived from the concentration to be extremely useful as they enter the workforce. Church now works as a data scientist at Patreon, a start-up in San Francisco that connects artists and fans through recurring funding, while Lee is at Pandora working on operations, data analysis, and overall production coordination for the company’s genre stations and branded playlists. “I think coming into digital music, being an applied math major has definitely helped,” Lee says. “Just being comfortable with data and seeing music as not only a creative art but also a quantitative data set has given me a leg up so early in my career.”
Church agrees with Lee’s assessment. “I am a great endorser of SEAS’s applied math concentration,” she says. “In terms of being in a cross-disciplinary field in applied math and music, I think it worked very well to my advantage because I was able to say, ‘Hey, I have the hard skills… but also, here’s a field I’m really interested in… that opens up my perspective.’”
But the voices supporting this model of learning do so for reasons that are not only career-oriented but also philosophical. Suzannah E. Clark, professor and director of undergraduate studies for the Music Department, currently teaches Music 223r: Neo-Riemannian Analysis, a graduate course on how mathematical transformations can inform music. Her class often attracts undergraduates interested in blending math and music, and she advocates similar courses for their potential impact in cultivating greater thought in students. “What you get from these kind of courses is the humanistic mind and the scientific mind comes together—either in the same person or in different people coming together at the same thing in two different angles,” she says. “What I think is fruitful with a body of students that come from these different angles is that they come to appreciate different ways of thinking.”
In keeping with Clark’s words, Young says that approaching music in a mathematical way has in fact aided not only her quantitative ability but also her artistic creativity. “I really like [ applied mathematics/music] because I’m a musician… [and] studying music as a math—it almost seems like studying a language class,” she says. “[You’re] putting [music] into a system or a pattern. There’s actually a system that I can go back to. It inspires new ideas for what I want to compose.”
Ultimately, however, Clark feels that the applied mathematics concentration—for all that its name connotes scientific rigor and practicality—is simply a manifestation of Harvard’s liberal arts sensibility.  “One of the thing that I think is really important about the liberal arts system is the fact that Harvard has many, many different students and that they are going to have many, many different strengths and interests,” Clark says. “I think what the university should encourage is that if you have different passions, that you can be the person that can bring them together.”
So while the music track of the applied mathematics concentration isn’t without its obstacles—and while it certainly isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when one mentions liberal arts—there exists no better representation of a field of study that encourages its students to do exactly as Clark says: to meld the best elements of disparate subjects to form a more perfect, surprisingly elegant whole.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On initial glance, the black-and-white photo on the screen tells a simple story—that of people descending the stairs to an airplane. But certain details stand out: the man wearing a heavy parka; the leis adorning the figures’ necks; the two barefoot girls, incongruous in their grass skirt and bras. One of the women is shivering. “This photo is of [dancers Leo Akau and Nona Wilson] exiting their plane at JFK in the dead of winter,” Kapena Baptista ’16 says. He gestures to his laptop as he continues to explain the picture’s backstory. “[Wilson is] insanely cold, but they had to do that because the hotel wanted them to... get this photo…. I wrote, like, 15 pages on this image basically because it’s a very heavy image…. They are almost rendered magical, but at the same time, the magic is almost ridiculous.”
A joint concentrator in music and anthropology, Baptista is speaking about his thesis on the dancers of a Hawaiian-themed showroom, which existed at the Lexington Hotel in New York from 1937 to 1966. Entitled “‘Lovely Hula Hands’: Native Hawaiian Identity in Hapa-Haole Music and Hula Performance,” the ethnomusicology thesis considers the roots behind the romanticized vision of Hawaii. “When you hear the word ‘Hawaii,’ what do you think?” he says. “[You think of] a beach, sunsets, palm trees, hula girls, et cetera. Throughout my project, I trace that to the development of tourism and the buildings of hotels in Hawaii, and link that to the development of this showroom in New York City, 5000 miles away.”
Baptista came upon the idea for his thesis sporadically. He initially wanted to focus on the Hawaiian Renaissance, a movement which generated backlash toward the touristic definition of Hawaii. However, after seeing an event on Facebook described as the “75th Anniversary of Hawaiian Room,” he booked a ticket to the celebration and met several of the former dancers at a dinner. This initial correspondence led to a trip to Hawaii in the summer, in which he looked into historical archives and conducted interviews with the women. “Through a genre, performance, and practice that can be easily problematized,” he says, “you get these narratives of survival that I found to be really quite fascinating.”
The product of his extensive research is a 95-page paper that delves into not only the technical aspects of the Hawaiian-inspired performances at the Lexington Hotel—the music used, the instruments involved, and their histories—but also the women’s lives and relationships with the people around them, from their past interactions with the showroom to their present associations. In Baptista’s consideration of the women’s current lives, he is able to bring in his prior interest with the Hawaiian Renaissance, though he now views the topic from a different perspective. “Songs about Hawaii during that time [of the 1930s to 1960s] were either very humorous or very romantic, but come the Renaissance, songs about Hawaii became very political,” he says. “A lot of what I talked about with the older women was how they visualize themselves now within the context of Haole… and how they position themselves more so with younger generations that are growing up… interacting with this very formalized version of Hula that has become very sacred, very ritualized.”
Though he worked on a thesis combining both anthropology and music, Baptista did not find it difficult to generate a topic that links the two focus fields, mostly because there already exists an area of study blending the two areas—ethnomusicology. For him, however, the greatest challenge was negotiating the classical-focused tradition with his desire to study a musical form that is more reflexive and not Western-based. “I am a classical musician,” he says. “But my more scholarly and personal interests were invested in music that existed outside of [that] domain, and I made it work.”
Ultimately, Baptista’s thesis is both a sensitive study into a historical and cultural event and a thoughtful narrative—one that serves both the dancers whose tales fill its pages but also himself. “I saw this project as a way for me to get to know more about myself as a Hawaiian,” he says. “And by looking at my culture and history through music in all of its complexity and consulting with more Hawaiians about it, I felt [the project] to be a really rewarding process. It’s such a wealth of information, waiting to be told.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Immersed in a seemingly unending sea of iPhones, laptops, and television sets, most people living in the 21st century consider the screen to be a truly contemporary medium. But for Visual and Environmental Studies professor Giuliana Bruno, the subject of screens stretches far beyond the realm of technology. “The architectural concept of the screen was a filter of light, something that created different zones, forms of intimacy, or zones of privacy,” Bruno says. In her latest course, “Screens: Media Archaeology and the Visual Arts,” Bruno and her students consider how screens act as junctions between individuals and the world around them. In particular, Bruno examines the screen through the lens of an emerging field––media archaeology. “Media archaeology is a relatively new term that defines excavating through the history of media,” she says. “It’s a way to understand where the history comes from and also how that history can be reinvented.”
Bruno’s graduate seminar, a foundational course in the Ph.D. program for film and visual studies, focuses on the history of the screen as a medium. “The screen acts not only as a place of transmission but also a face of mediation and transformation of the relationship between us and our surroundings,” she says. “It’s about looking at the present by way of its history.”
Throughout the semester, students use the ideas of media archaeology to chart the initial emergence of the screen and its steady transformation into its current state. However, Bruno stresses that her seminar, despite its thorough examination of the past, differs widely from a standard history course. “Media archaeology is not history work in the traditional sense; it’s not linear, not about origin,” she says. “It’s more about association, about montage, about putting together different ways, almost transversally, to view mediums in conjunction with other kinds of forms.”
These “other kinds of forms” span an impressive range of topics, including anthropology and, interestingly, science. “We look at the way screens emerged as a scientific invention, and how the worlds of art and science are connected,” Bruno says. “We’re looking at things like phantasmagoria, shadow play, optical toys—things invented to understand perception in a scientific context that artists use in their own ways of understanding perception and feeling.” Additionally, Bruno’s class investigates the medium’s transition from movie theatres to art galleries, where freestanding screens of varying scale function as architectural pieces. “What’s interesting is that contemporary artists today are becoming historians, even archivists,” Bruno says. “They’re going into obsolete forms, they’re reinventing what used to be called the art of projection, and they’re making it into new forms with new functions.”
Having previously taught a course on visual fabrics within architecture and contemporary art, Bruno considers most of her seminars to be natural extensions of her own research. “Screens,” for example, emerged from her 2014 book “Surface: Matters of Aesthetics, Materiality and Media.” For Bruno, these seminars allow her to explore the larger questions surrounding her work through the distinct backgrounds of her students, including comparative literature and philosophy. “I consider the seminar to be a laboratory of ideas,” Bruno says. “I think the art of the moving image should be discussed in this interdisciplinary way, so I’m happy when students bring their different perspectives and share them collectively.”
For Bruno, among the most important aspects of media archaeology is the non-passive study of various mediums, specifically the consideration of history as a form of potentiality. “I’m looking at history not in terms of what happened—the facts—but what might have happened,” Bruno says. “What if we went in this direction instead of this other direction? … That’s where you get ideas.” In encouraging her students to think about potential narratives in addition to present and future ones, Bruno hopes to instill in them a passion for artistic innovation. “We’re obviously living in a world of mediums,” she says, “and to understand the contemporary world—and to change it—we need to know how we got to this place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For his senior thesis, History and Literature concentrator John N. Sakellariadis ’16 took the unique approach of using graffiti to study combat morale in the Vietnam war. The Crimson sat down with Sakellariadis to discuss his 58-page work, "Waiting for Vietnam: Vietnam-era Canvas Graffiti and American Combat Morale in the Pre-Tet Period.”
While investigating literary responses to war, Sakellariadis stumbled upon an archive of graffiti that soldiers drew on the way to Vietnam. In troopships, soldiers had used the blank bed canvases on their cots to scrawl messages and drawings as they sailed away from home. The canvases thus provide a unique look into the troops’ mental state. “It wasn’t PTSD,” Sakellariadis says, “because for 95 percent of soldiers on the ships it was before they’d ever been to battle.”
Not all the graffiti was particularly enlightening. “A lot of it, to be honest, is just stuff you’d see scrawled in a bathroom stall,” he says. “There’s a lot of references to pot, LSD, some really crazy stuff…. One guy wrote ‘Where is Lee Harvey Oswald when you need him?’” But what Sakellariadis did see consistently appearing in the archive was a distinctly anti-army attitude. The subversive acronym FTA, for example, showed up frequently on canvases. It stood for “Fuck The Army,” but had originally been a term used to recruit new members, meaning “Fun, Travel, Adventure.”
Protest within the army against the Vietnam War is a well-known phenomenon, but Sakellariadis’ research was unique in two ways. The graffiti, for one thing, had been a relatively little-known artifact. “Nobody had written about it in a more scholarly fashion,” Sakellariadis says. But even more importantly, the messages he found on the canvases were drawn from a period earlier than what is traditionally known as the beginning of anti-Vietnam sentiments. “What has been well-documented historically is that after 1968, there’s this GI movement to end the war,” he says. But the Pope, the ship that Sakellariadis studied canvases from, was exclusively in service before 1968, and almost all the soldiers onboard had never fought in the war before.
His thesis stemmed from this important distinction. “Basically, I was saying there are these incipient cultures of dissent in the military that you can see kind of being formulated in the graffiti,” he says. Another side of the issue he could investigate was the difference between anti-army and anti-war sentiments. “I was trying to figure out was whether this meant they were opposed to the Vietnam war or just lamenting the institutionalized aspects of the army,” he says.
One of the most challenging parts of writing his thesis, Sakellariadis explains, was the visual nature of graffiti. “It’s just such a hard thing to analyze,” he says. “You can look at these images for a long time and come away with insights, but actually turning that into a thesis was really, really hard, and part of that is that it’s just so difficult to interpret graffiti.” Sakellariadis’ junior paper also had a uniquely visual topic; he wrote about the postcards of lynching that were circulated in the beginning of the twentieth century.
The thesis process was personally rewarding for Sakellariadis, whose uncle served in Vietnam. Writing his senior thesis gave Sakellariadis plenty of time to think hard about questions of wartime. After graduating in the spring, he will be completing a fellowship at the Institute of War in Washington, DC. “I’ve always thought war is really interesting, in the American context, because we’re all about individualism,” he says. “And the military context, the military ethos, is about obedience to authority structures, and so they’re fundamentally antithetical.”

The Drunkenness of Noah
Noah appeared in Peter’s doorway that Friday night. He stared at Peter through hazy, mystified sapphire eyes like a silty spring. His grin stretched all the way across his face. He swayed a little. Noah wrapped his arms around Peter and rested his forehead on Peter’s. He exhaled a faint mist of vodka soda. Peter tried to freeze the moment in his mind, but before he had the chance, Noah slipped down the stairs and through the bathroom door, telling Peter he’d be right back.
Time passed. Peter opened the bathroom door and found Noah collapsed in front of the toilet, a look of frustration bleeding through the pale nausea on his face.  Noah looked at Peter sheepishly and began to apologize profusely. He hadn’t thought he was this drunk! He just needed to get it out of his system and he’d be fine!
Peter sat cross-legged on the tile floor and held Noah’s hand as he wretched to no avail. Time passed. The silence between them grew audible, even over Noah’s guttural croaks. Then Noah began to cry. It was a crying, Peter knew, that had nothing to do with the current debacle. It was a much larger crying. This crying that lived far off in another realm of Noah’s life. Noah sat on the floor of Peter’s bathroom crying, and Peter sat beside him holding his hand.
Eventually, Noah rose. He walked into Peter’s bedroom and stumbled onto his bed. As far as Noah was concerned, his own inebriation was all the consent required. Peter stood beside the bed and finally crawled in beside Noah and lay looking upward. Peter sighed and, while it broke his heart, he realized that he could go on without Noah.
Mine
Samson and Delilah lived in a balloon now and talked to one another in words that began in one’s mouth and ended in the other’s. The ArchAngels watered the small Mason jar garden they’d begun to grow. Snow had begun to fall again. Peter sat in his room and read comfortably in relative silence interrupted only by the crisp turning of pages.
Time
Time passed. It passed like a car on the highway in that it never seemed to stand still. It passed like an illness in that it never seemed to plague Peter for very long. It passed like the expression of a person. It appeared so crucial and integral to everyone’s lives but lost all significance in the dark embrace of his bedcovers, his butterfly-like wings folded beneath him and his heart beating softly beneath the sheets
Gospel According To
Peter wondered if the ArchAngels would ever understand their power. They could save and they could destroy. A life had fed and weaned off of the warmth of their halos. But they were not yet nurturing. They were spiteful. They could not forgive. They could only pretend to forget. They could barely grow thyme in a Mason jar.
Maybe one day it would all be written into scripture, and the ArchAngels would know the power they possessed. Then perhaps Paradise would be whole again.
No Angel
Put your arms around me. Tell me I’m a problem.
Peter sat on a bench by the Charles and watched the river flow by. He could hear in its quiet burble its length and its power. He felt the power of the earth running alongside it. But he was no longer envious of it. It was cold, and he wrapped his arms around himself the way no other could. So much lay ahead of him, so much that was  under his influence. He did not feel like God. He felt like a person.
He watched the river and thought of the hurricanes in Japan that the beat of his wings might create.

Some of Harvard’s most famous alumni are artists who graduated from the College 10 to 30 years ago. Although many of them concentrated in fields outside the arts and recall fewer curricular opportunities in the arts than are offered today, they remember a strikingly familiar vibrant extracurricular arts scene, and many credit academic work—artistic and otherwise—for some of their success.
Greg M. Daniels ’85 was a history and literature concentrator, but he cites creative writing classes as the most useful for his career. “I took two courses with William Alfred, who was a playwright who wrote ‘Hogan’s Goat,’” he says. “He had a freshman seminar on story and a class on playwriting that I took as a senior—very good classes, both.”
Evidently, he learned a lot. After graduating in 1985, Daniels garnered Emmys writing for “Saturday Night Live” and “The Simpsons,” but he is best known for his contributions to three of the most successful comedies in American television: He developed “King of the Hill” with Mike Judge, adapted the American version of “The Office,” and co-created “Parks and Recreation” with fellow alumnus Michael H. Schur ’97.
By writing for the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, alongside comedian Conan C. O’Brien ’85, Daniels supplemented the limited academic offerings for his career choice as a television writer. “I don’t know how many other [creative writing] classes there were at the time,” he says. “I think there were some poetry and creative prose writing classes, but the playwriting classes were pretty much the choice if you wanted to do dialogue.”
One of Daniels’s “Parks and Recreation” colleagues, Dan J. Goor ’97, avoided the creative writing curriculum altogether. “Biochemistry was my concentration, so I didn’t do a tremendous number of arts classes, although I did take Introduction to Directing, which was a theater class,” he says. The class was taught by Marcus Stern, who still teaches the class—now titled “Directing”—and serves as head of directing in the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration.
But Goor named a very different academic experience as the most influential of his time at the College. “I wrote a thesis, and I have to say, I learned a lot about writing by writing that thesis,” he says. “Scientific writing is so economical, and the words you use are so important, and so that was a real training ground for writing in general for me.”
Goor identifies one element of writing a scientific paper that proved especially helpful as a comedic writer. “You’re learning how to write in somebody’s voice, and that’s the voice of the scientist, to a certain extent,” he says. Goor would later rely on that skill while writing in the voices of Jon Stewart for “The Daily Show,” Carson Daly for “Last Call with Carson Daly,” and O’Brien for “Late Night with Conan O’Brien.” Goor’s most famous work includes several episodes of “Parks and Recreation,” including the lyrics of “5,000 Candles in the Wind,” the show’s eulogy for the miniature horse Li’l Sebastian. He also co-created the series “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” with Schur.
Like Goor, Colleen A. McGuinness ’99, who produced and wrote for “30 Rock” and “About a Boy,” took Stern’s class, “Introduction to Directing.” It was her sole curricular experience with theater, despite heavy involvement with the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players. “There was no theater concentration at the time, and [taking electives] was something you could do to supplement, but you couldn’t concentrate in that,” she says. “I certainly would have been thrilled to take more film directing classes and screenwriting, if they’d had it. When I was there, that wasn’t really the focus. I’ve seen the book now, and it seems like there’s a lot more courses being offered in those areas.”
McGuinness, an English concentrator, did take one creative writing class, a nonfiction seminar with memoirist Natalie Kusz. “It was a little challenging, because it required a lot of thought and time, like any good creative writing class would,” she says. “What I was impressed with was how serious all of the students in the class were. All the other students took their writing very seriously. Everybody seemed to have something to say, so once we read each other’s work and offered comments, everybody’s notes were thoughtful and helpful.” McGuinness says the class helped her refine her storytelling. “[It] helped me filter out what might actually be interesting to a larger audience,” she says.
For Alec J. Nevala-Lee ’02, another kind of class looms largest in his artistic development. “I took a couple classes in Latin and Greek prose composition,” Nevala-Lee, a classics concentrator, says. “You’re writing essays, basically, in Latin and Greek, so [you’re] internalizing grammar from the inside and thinking more systematically about how sentences are put together.”
Although Nevala-Lee’s “The Icon Thief” trilogy of novels is in English, he says his experience writing in ancient languages was particularly impactful. “It really did change my writing style,” he says. “It kind of alters your brain in ways that you don’t really appreciate at the time. My writing now has been shaped in really profound ways by one or two classes I took.”
Benjamin D. Scheuer ’04, whose one-man musical “The Lion” won the 2015 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance, believes his coursework benefited his artistic pursuits less directly. In some ways, he found Harvard’s creative offerings lacking. “The music program, I found, was more theoretical than performative, and I’m an instrumentalist and a performer,” he says. “Harvard did not offer instruction in or facilities for recording, which was disappointing to me as an undergraduate. Similarly, songwriting is extremely important to me…. That’s my job; I write songs. There was certainly no instruction in songwriting, and I think that would have been wonderful.” Scheuer expresses hope that the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration will address some of the curriculum’s shortfalls in artistic practice.
But as an English concentrator, although he did not take a creative writing seminar, Scheuer studied aspects of the arts that he says have helped him in his professional endeavors. “Studying poetry and literature and the structure of theater in English class has certainly proved valuable,” he says. “I like to put three-act structure into two-minute songs, and you get that by studying Greek theater.”
W. Couper Samuelson ’02, who has served as producer and executive producer for dozens of films, including the Oscar-winning “Whiplash,” learned other industry tips from his academic pursuits. Samuelson, a double concentrator in history and literature and romance languages and literatures, did not have room for many arts electives, but he managed to take “Visual and Environmental Studies 50,” an introductory filmmaking class. “I got in by the skin of my teeth, because it was mainly for VES concentrators at the time,” he says. “I had to go to [the professor’s] office three or four times to convince him that I was capable, or at least committed, and then he let me in.”
Samuelson believes getting into VES 50 was itself an introduction to the production process. “In a weird way, that was a good lesson for how life works,” he says. “If you want something, you might have to fight to get it.”
He also believes his concentrations have served him well in the filmmaking industry. “I think fundamentally, storytelling and the sort of critical thinking that comes with it, is something that comes out of reading Jane Austen novels and thinking critically about them, and also reading historical texts and primary sources as literature,” he says.
Samuelson reflected positively on his general experience with the liberal arts, especially as a means of exploration. “I, in general, think that a liberal arts education is valuable if you want to work in the arts,” he says. “There are some people who know exactly what kind of art they want to do when they're 17 years old, but I think that’s a pretty slender demographic of people.”

Dear Arts readers (or as Ha likes to say, Arts baes),
With elation and excitement, we present to you our special spring issue of 2016—the first of its kind, our new endeavour into the world of themed supplements. In the process of brainstorming our theme for the issue, we knew we wanted to cover “underground art,” the parts of the arts scene within Harvard and around Cambridge that our publication often neglects. But that topic by itself felt vague, even nebulous. After many discussions among the board in the confines of the Arts office, we finally came to the right questions. Namely, we’re always interested in the activities of our students in clubs and organizations, but what of the academics? What if you took “extracurricular” and crossed out the “extra”?
The result is the product you see before you. Whether you’re holding it in your hands in its physical form or scrolling through it on the screen of your phone, we’re incredibly excited to share this supplement with you. Be sure to take a moment to check out our spotlights on a couple of student theses—both completed and in development—to learn about graffiti, hula dancing, virtual reality, and the surprising power of rap and animation. Immerse yourself in the long-established Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and the newly-minted concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media. Let the Arts board ask the right questions to the right people for you. And definitely read our feature on Professor Peter L. Galison and our in-depth coverage of the music track of the applied mathematics concentration to discover the often-unexpected link between the sciences and the arts.
In fact, we call this supplement “The Creative Classroom” because we believe in emphasizing such connections among fields, in finding and crossing the interdisciplinary bridges that comprise the hidden gems of the College. In this issue you won’t find us looking at film, at visual arts, at music, at theater, but instead at the spaces in between.
Before we leave you to read through our work, we’d like to thank all of our execs, writers, and compers for their time and dedication; our predecessors and dinos for their support; our designers for their beautiful print illustrations and work; our design execs Uju S. Nwosu ’17 and Tiffany K. Lam ’18 and our multimedia exec Katherine L. Borrazzo ’18 for all that they have contributed to helping us develop amazing designs and acquire stunning photos; and Managing Editor Meg P. Bernhard '17 and President Mariel A. Klein '17 for working with us throughout this semester to ensure the quality of our online and printed Arts content.
With all our (Arts) love,
Ha D.H. Le ’17 and Victoria Lin ’17Arts Chairs, 143rd Guard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust may be a historian by trade, but she maneuvers like a politician—one who avoids displeasing anyone by pleasing no one. This profitable strategy of running hot and cold throws into high relief the disastrous attempts at appeasement made by other administrators confronted with controversial campus protests. While Faust faces the same dilemma of addressing student concerns, unlike other Ivy League bosses, she has successfully avoided becoming mired in the activism that begets them.
The tight-lipped Faust has generally avoided taking substantial public positions on the third-rail issues of campus politics.  But when she does speak up, it is nearly impossible to tell what she really means. Faust the academic appears unwilling to sacrifice history for comfort, having stated that “Harvard should not begin renaming its buildings or titles en masse.” As she told The Crimson, sanitizing the past makes it hard for us to learn from our mistakes.
But Faust the tactician knows when to make concessions. And her dithering statements and positions make it hard to determine exactly what she thinks about the key issues that drive campus activism and protests—but that’s exactly the point. For instance, while she has expressed discomfort with changing names, she supported scrapping the “House Master” title, despite its specious connection to slavery.
Her peers have not been so shrewd. For the presidents of Princeton University, Brown University, and the University of Pennsylvania, the chickens are coming home to roost. The Ivy League trio has learned the hard way that placating student protesters with strong words and symbolic actions does not silence them—it only validates their protests and encourages them to make more demands.
In December 2014, Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton applauded nascent social justice movements, stating that “Protests across the country and on our own campus testify eloquently to the anguish caused by the unfairness that persists within American society.” Almost a year later, he found his office occupied by fulminating social justice protesters armed with a lengthy list of demands. Having painted himself into a corner, Eisgruber had little choice but to accede.
Around the same time Eisgruber was lauding campus protest, University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann literally prostrated herself before a group of protesters who crashed her Christmas party. She was no more lucky than Eisgruber. A year after Gutmann’s painfully symbolic capitulation, she was handed her own list of demands by protesters.
Christina Paxson, the president of Brown, paid the highest price for her obsequious support of student protesters on her campus. In November of 2015, a Latino student visiting the school from Dartmouth reported that he was assaulted by a police officer on campus. Paxson hosted—or tried to host—a public forum to address student outcry in the wake of the incident, but ended up being used as a punching bag by student activists more interested in blowing off steam than having a dialogue.
Paxson, likely fearing more rebuke, subsequently issued an apology for the alleged assault to the Presidents of the Ivy League universities, as if she had committed it herself. The following January, a contrite Paxson announced a whopping $100 million initiative to battle racism on Brown’s campus.
While Faust has been the subject of student protest, she has avoided confrontation with the contemporary brand of student activism that has embroiled her peers. Massachusetts Hall, home to her office, was occupied by protesters last year, but it was an environmentalist group (Divest Harvard), not a social justice protest, that did the occupying.
Even in the face of that protest, Faust’s tendency to stay mum shielded her from the brunt of student reproach.  She refused to meet with the protesters inside Mass Hall, so they gave up. There were no harangues or ultimatums. She won.
There is good reason why Faust, unlike other wilting Ivy League Presidents, has not been verbally assaulted or forced to sign a laundry list of demands. By toeing a fine line between submitting to student activists and appearing aloof to their demands, she has avoided entanglement in contentious student issues altogether.  If the angry masses don’t know what you think, they can’t use it against you.
So Faust’s approach of how to engage each side of the social justice battle on campus becomes clear: Stay opaque, but make small gestures every now and then to show you kind of, sort of agree. In a startlingly noncommittal letter, she announced her support for dumping the Law School’s 80-year-old seal, but in the next breath cautioned the school not to “erase” its past. This tepid statement, of course, came after she spent months officially undecided on the issue.
Faust’s most recent gesture—installing a plaque commemorating slaves who worked and lived at Harvard and reflecting on the University’s unfortunate connection with slavery— is about as safe a move she could possibly make. When it comes to social issues on campus, she is happy to throw a bone, but refuses to stoke the flames.
Faust plays her cards close to her chest.  Unlike her colleague, Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow—whose hand was tragically tipped by her social justice C.V.—and unlike her Ivy League peers who capitulated so soon to protesters, Faust can credibly stay neutral and avoid the maelstrom of campus revolt altogether.
It sure does pay to sit on the fence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m the bitter brown boy. I complain about the lack of faculty diversity on campus, meet with high-ranking administrators, and advocate for a culture of empathy and sensitivity. I’m hyper-aware of the melanin in my skin and I make sure everyone knows it.
But why? As an observant Crimson commenter pointed out on my previous piece, should I really be criticizing the fat entitlement that is a Harvard education? Maybe I should graciously accept the privilege of being a Harvard student, one of a select elite, and just appreciate what I’ve been given.
I would shut up and accept the privilege if I could. I really would if my time on campus wasn’t filled with reminders that maybe, just maybe, this place isn’t for me. When I find my experience at Harvard altered by the simple fact that my skin is darker than the majority of my peers, I find it impossible to be anything but outspoken.
During Opening Days, I went to one of the upperclassman houses to pick up a couch my white roommate had in storage. As he spoke to the building manager, I stood beside him.
“I see you brought a laborer.”
In the two seconds of silence my roommate and I spent deciding whether or not it was a really awful joke, the confusion in the building manager’s face and his follow up made it clear.
“Or is he the roommate?” An afterthought.
Fine, perhaps I shouldn’t be too sensitive. Perhaps, I should ignore the history spanning years of workers laboring endless hours in the sun, for close to no pay, to build up this country. Perhaps I should have been wearing Harvard gear, just to ensure that my body on this campus was valid.
On to the next day.
I’m sitting with some friends in the dining hall—the one that we’re told we should embrace as our own, even without a single portrait on the wall that looks like us. I hear the suggestions that I should broaden my horizons and really understand diverse perspectives, but somehow this doesn’t sit well. We’re accused of self-segregation when we advocate for a multicultural center, when we’re throwing Spanish around in the dining hall, being a little loud, or when we have an all brown, or all black, blocking group. A group composed of entirely white, blonde students sits one table over.
I got an email last semester from a Crimson news writer asking to interview me about a meeting with President Faust that I attended. I agreed, but upperclassmen who had attended this meeting as well, and had a history with interviews in the past, warned me to be thoughtful and careful about the way I phrased what I had to say. They knew, as I’d come to learn, that when there are only a few of us in the classroom and extracurricular organizations, we run the risk of representing an entire population. I choose to engage with my culture by being active in the Latinx organizations on campus, but this automatically makes me the voice of “The Harvard Latino,” as if we were a monolith. But, hey, I should be honored or something, right?
When I hear that people don’t want me to talk about race, I wish I could stop. I wish that my skin color didn’t affect the way I fit into this institution. I wish my beautiful brown skin, ingrained with the complex history of my mother and her mother before her, could exist the same way white skin does on this campus.
But that simply isn’t the way things are at Harvard, and it isn’t the way things are out in the world, and I won’t stop talking until people begin to realize that. As long as your anecdotes become national news while mine are dismissed as whiny, entitled student activism, I’ll continue to speak out. I’m waiting for the day I can stop, but I won’t be quiet while I wait. I’m a brown boy, writing, mobilizing, learning. I’m a bitter brown boy still breathing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, University President Drew G. Faust met with Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James to finalize an agreement to recognize the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Harvard. This marks the first time that all three ROTC programs—Army, Navy, and Air Force—have been represented on Harvard’s campus since the Vietnam War. We are proud to see the legacy of Harvard’s storied history of military service renewed.
There are few higher callings than service for one’s country, and the armed services deserve the utmost respect and gratitude from our community. But our praise must not solely come in the form of empty words, as they so often do. The best way for us to show thanks to our classmates in uniform is to support the ROTC program and to encourage it to grow and flourish. Officially recognizing the program is an important first step in this process: Harvard Air Force ROTC cadets can now know they attend a university that is unafraid to celebrate their service.
Those who serve have made a decision the rest of us chose to sidestep. They gave up comfort and safety for a higher calling—a belief in duty, honor, and country. The military is not perfect, but we need not rehash past arguments over Vietnam or debate the merits of The War on Terror to support President Faust’s most recent measure. While there are undeniably issues with the military—and those who enlist should not be presented with a white-washed, PTSD-free narrative of service—the blemishes of our past and present do not in any way diminish the depth of courage it takes to follow that call.
The reasons for the decision to recognize the Air Force ROTC today, however, should go beyond the valor of soldiers. Indeed, the military itself has taken a series of admirable steps in modernizing its policies. The decision to repeal “Don't Ask, Don't Tell,” and the upcoming end to the ban on transgender service, in particular, portend to the establishment of a more inclusive military—one in which all Americans can serve together. The military’s progress on these critical social issues should make us all still more proud to have such an institution on our campus.
Ensuring that ROTC students feel included on campus is not simply a matter of practicality, but one of diversity as well. At Harvard, conversations surrounding diversity usually take place in the context of racial and socioeconomic inequality. But as important as those conversations are, we must not lose sight of the value of maintaining different kinds of diversity—diversity of experience, perspective, and even future career paths. Including students who are interested in joining the military—an organization consisting of nearly one and a half million Americans—is a critical aspect of this mission.
We are all made better by their presence, not only in an intimate sense, as students whose horizons they broaden, but also in a larger sense, as citizens whose daily lives they safeguard. As we understand better their sacrifices, we should be moved to gratitude, and from gratitude to action. Expanding the official recognition of ROTC at Harvard is a step forward on this path. We thank our ROTC classmates for their service, and we thank President Faust for easing their path just a little bit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Millennials prefer a Democrat win this year's presidential election, according to the Institute of Politics' Public Opinion Project spring poll.
The poll, which the IOP conducts twice a year, included responses from 3,183 18- to 29-year-olds about their views on politics, with a focus on the current presidential campaign.
The margin of difference between millennials’ preference for Democrats to keep control of the White House and preference for Republicans to win the upcoming presidential election was nearly double that of last year’s poll.
61 percent of those polled preferred a Democrat remain in the White House, while 33 percent preferred a Republican to win. Last year, 55 percent said they preferred a Democrat, while 40 percent preferred a Republican.
John Della Volpe, the IOP’s director of polling, said one of the largest takeaways from the poll results is millennial support for Democratic presidential candidates.
“The preference for [Democrats to take] the White House increased over last year,” he said.
Bernie Sanders, according to the poll, is the only candidate with a net-positive favorability rating at 23 percent, while Trump’s favorability was negative 57 percent for all survey respondents and negative 20 percent among Republicans. Hillary R. Clinton proved significantly more popular than Donald J. Trump, with the former Secretary of State leading the business mogul by 36 points among likely voters.
Survey respondents also expressed pessimism about the state of the country in general.
Only 15 percent of millennials said they believed the United States is headed in the right direction, and nearly half believed politics are unable to address the challenges currently facing the country.
Despite the lack of faith in the current state of politics, Sonya G. Jacobs ’18, the Public Opinion Project’s student chair, noted that the poll results indicated millennials may seek public service involvement outside of politics.
“Millennials do really care deeply about this country and they want to be civically engaged, but not necessarily through politics,” she said. “One-third of millennials will volunteer for a campaign but far more, 67 percent, would do community service for a worthy cause.”
The poll also reported that millennials think poorly of the country’s criminal justice system. 47 percent of respondents said they have “no” or “not much” faith in the justice system to reach a fair conclusion that does not take into account race or ethnicity.
Jacobs said the Public Opinion Project group asked similar questions last spring on criminal justice.
“[We] got almost identical numbers, so there has seemingly been little change over time for millennials on this issue,” she said.
On questions of gender equality, 59 percent of respondents said they believed there is a glass ceiling preventing women from career advancement in America, including 68 percent of women and 50 percent of men. Additionally, 64 percent said men have more advantages than women in America, while only 7 percent believed women have more advantages.
There was also a gender divide on which presidential candidate would most improve women’s lives. While men preferred Clinton over Sanders by 11 percentage points, 30 percent of women surveyed said they believe Sanders will do the most for women, while only 26 percent chose Clinton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his new book on unfinished revolutions in the Middle East, Brookings Institution Senior Foreign Policy Fellow Ibrahim Fraihat proposed that new governments lead inclusive national discussions to avoid violence and civil war.
The Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs hosted the event Monday as part of its Middle East Initiative, which organizes academic panels, research presentations, and guest lectures covering public policy issues relevant to the Middle East.
Fraihat, who is also an affiliate scholar at Georgetown University, discussed his book, "Unfinished Revolutions: Yemen, Libya, and Tunisia after the Arab Spring." Published six days ago, the book is the culmination of three years of intense on-the-ground research in Middle Eastern countries, Fraihat said.
“The lessons that I got from the field are so extremely valuable in my view, and I wanted to make sure I share these lessons with the outside world—to know what is really happening in these countries and how these countries can be supported to avoid civil war,” Fraihat said.
Fraihat stressed the importance of taking measures to ensure stable regime changes following shifts in the leadership of many Middle Eastern nations.
“When countries go through transition, they need to avoid violence and civil wars and to begin peace, stability, and development,” he said.
Fraihat argued that the key to creating stability is to engage in post-conflict development that focuses on unity and national inclusivity.
“They need to immediately engage in inclusive national reconciliation processes that involves everyone through national dialogue within the society. They can talk about the challenges that they are facing without excluding anyone,” Fraihat said.
Fraihat added that holding human rights violators and corrupt political actors accountable for their crimes is vital to establishing post-conflict stability. He also said that implementing institutional reform and providing reparations for victims of revolutions, such as prisoners of war, was also integral to creating national stability.
“You have to deal with the refugees, for example,” he said, discussing the number of internally displaced people within Libya. “You cannot make a successful transition without reintegrating the ex-combatant back into society.”
Nadia Ali ’17 was pleased with Fraihat’s exploration of solutions to current, salient political issues facing the Middle East.
“There’s always something interesting because the revolution is ongoing; it’s still ongoing—hence the title of the book 'Unfinished Revolutions,'” she said. “There’s always  more to learn about what’s going well and what can be improved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and final clubs have for months retained a frayed relationship. While Khurana has publicly emphasized ample amounts of “common ground” between the two parties, many final club affiliates—behind closed doors and in private communications—have criticized administrators, who have increasingly pressured the historically single-sex groups to adopt gender-neutral memberships.
Now, after months of tension and one rare public statement from the Porcellian club, the Fly, another final club, has publicly called for an end to Khurana’s involvement in negotiations with the unrecognized, historically single-gender organizations.
In a letter addressed to Khurana, graduate president of the Fly Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 requested “details of allegations (if any) of sexual assaults involving Fly Club premises” in the past five years and called for Khurana to “recuse himself from further discussion with final clubs because of conflicts of interest and perceived, if not actual, ethical impropriety.”
While the letter praised Khurana and his wife Stephanie R. Khurana as “exemplary individuals...well-liked even by those who oppose their agenda,” Porteus was sharply critical of the dean’s rationale for compelling single-gender social organizations to widen their membership.
In addition to requesting information on alleged Fly Club-related assaults and Khurana’s recusal, Porteus’s four-page letter included broader criticisms of the methodology and conclusions of a recent University-wide task force report on sexual assault prevention that upbraided final clubs for creating a culture “often inimical to Harvard College.”
Porteus’s letter also offers a glimpse into Khurana’s attitude toward the clubs, which differs markedly from that of his predecessors. The letter additionally provides details about a year of meetings between College administrators and final clubs that Khurana has repeatedly insisted are confidential.
“In the interest of transparency,” Porteus wrote, he sent a copy of the letter to a Crimson reporter. Khurana sent a brief response to Porteus thanking him for his “ongoing willingness” to engage in discussions about campus environment.
‘PERCEIVED, IF NOT ACTUAL, ETHICAL IMPROPRIETY’
According to the letter, Porteus has now twice requested details on any allegation of sexual assault related to the Fly Club over the past five years and “deemed credible” by the College. He also made the request at a confidential meeting on April 13.
Porteus wrote that over the four years studied in last year’s University-wide sexual climate survey, College administrators have “shared no allegation of sexual assault occurring on Fly Club premises or involving Fly Club members or their guests, if indeed any such reports or allegations were received and deemed credible by the administration.”
“Nevertheless,” Porteus added, “the administration has included the Fly Club in its campaign of innuendo and threats, a campaign seemingly aimed at achieving the political agenda of the administration, rather than ensuring the safety of Harvard undergraduates.”
Porteus’s subsequent request that Khurana “voluntarily recuse himself” from discussion of final club policy rested on several perceived “conflicts of interest” that Porteus argued should disqualify Khurana from further discussions with the clubs. 
First, he wrote that Khurana has referred to himself in previous meetings as an “‘employee’ operating under specific instructions from his ‘employer’ (his words) to impose coed membership on single-gender student social organizations that exist independent of the university.” Porteus argued that meetings with Khurana have focused almost exclusively on co-ed membership policies rather than on sexual assault prevention.
Khurana’s superior, University President Drew G. Faust, has made unusually public comments regarding final clubs this year. William F. Lee ’72, a senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, has also said the Corporation “regularly” discusses final clubs with Khurana. Both Faust and Lee, though, have described their club-related work with Khurana as collaborative rather than directive.
Porteus argued that Khurana’s commitment to the “unproven and contentious premise” that independent single-gender social clubs contribute to sexual assault on campus denies club members “the opportunity to respond to specific complaints, if any, and plac[es] a life-long cloud over their affiliation with a single-gender final club, male or female.”
Third, Porteus argued that as “an administrator of a university that stands to lose” its federal funding if an ongoing Title IX investigation does not go Harvard’s way, Khurana’s “incentive to blame, then claim to reform unrecognized, independent, single-gender, student social organizations is obvious.”
The College is currently under investigation by the Department of Education for Title IX compliance.
Khurana’s fourth perceived “conflict of interest,” Porteus wrote, is a pending federal suit from recent alumna Alyssa R. Leader ’15 charging that administrators permitted her alleged assailant to remain living in Cabot House with her despite requests to remove him. At the time of the complaint, Khurana was Cabot’s House Master, a title that has since been changed to Faculty Dean.
“Focusing attention on student membership in independent single-gender social organizations, male and female, diverts attention from a law suit,” Porteus wrote.
A University-wide task force report referenced survey data indicating that 47 percent of senior women at the College who had participated in final club activities reported experiencing non-consensual sexual contact since beginning College—the highest rate of any student activity polled.
Porteus criticized the University’s task force on sexual assault prevention, claiming that it focuses too heavily on final clubs as opposed to Harvard’s Houses, where, according to the report, 87 percent of reported sexual assaults involving female victims took place.
“The report does not mention the words ‘House’ or ‘dormitory’ in either its introduction or key recommendations (pp. 1-3),” Porteus wrote. “Nevertheless, one of six key recommendations is that final clubs ‘include all genders’ (p. 3).”
Porteus further argued that Khurana’s position as a Harvard Business School professor, “which many of the threatened students, male and female, hope to attend,” creates an environment in which club members feel “frightened and undermined even if they’ve done nothing wrong.”
Porteus wrote that these alleged “conflicts of interest” are sufficient grounds for Khurana to recuse himself from further final club discussion.
“The time has come to refocus attention, away from the political ends of the current university administration, and back on student safety,” Porteus wrote.
Ending his letter, Porteus requested an “acknowledgment” of his requests by April 29, in time for the upcoming meeting of the Fly’s board of directors. Finally, Porteus wrote that he would send a copy of his letter to the graduate leaders of the 12 other final clubs and The Crimson.
In a separate email to The Crimson, Porteus wrote he had not thought much about who he would like to see replace Khurana as the main liaison between the administration and the clubs.
“That’s entirely up to the administration,” Porteus wrote. “I just hope they can identify someone who knows how to set a more welcoming table.”
In a brief response to Porteus, Khurana thanked him for his “ongoing willingness to engage with the College in the important conversations about how this community can create a healthy and inclusive campus environment.”
While College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment on whether Khurana would agree to either of Porteus’s recommendations, Khurana’s email suggested that Porteus’s request that Khurana recuse himself, at least, might not be accepted any time soon.
“Throughout our discussions, the College has a single objective, namely doing what is best for the student body at Harvard College,” Khurana wrote to Porteus. “I look forward to carrying on in that effort as conversations with you and the other club leaders continue.”
A TROUBLED PAST
Requests aside, Porteus’s letter highlight how Khurana’s approach to final clubs has diverged widely from that of his predecessors. While the clubs have officially been unaffiliated with the University since 1984, recent years have seen some engagement and coordination between current administrators and club leaders.
At the April 13 meeting between Khurana and club leaders, according to Porteus’s letter, Porteus said that “one or more of the club's graduate officers have attended every informational meeting and every training session conducted by the Office of Student Life to which the Fly Club has been invited.”
Porteus wrote that these included annual meetings with then-Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, Christopher M. Gilbert from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and Michelle Mandino from the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
A vocal critic of final clubs, Khurana has repeatedly reiterated his belief that “single-gendered organizations are not appropriate for the College.”
Last fall, the previously all-male Spee and Fox clubs accepted women into their ranks—though the female members of the Fox club are still only “provisional” members. In a letter to graduates explaining their decision to accept women into the club, undergraduates wrote that administrative pressure from College administrators had compelled them to make their decision so quickly.
The administration  has buttressed its case against the clubs’ single-gender policies by citing high sexual assault rates associated with the clubs. These figures were drawn from a sexual climate survey conducted through the AAU in which multiple universities participated. A letter from the chair of the task force for sexual response, Steven E. Hyman, reported that at least 15 percent of sexual assaults occurred at “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities and sororities,” a designation administrators said was intended to denote final clubs.
A subsequent University-wide report this spring, citing AAU survey data, indicated that 47 percent of “female College seniors participating in the Final Clubs reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact since entering college.”
Porteus’s letter, however, criticized Harvard’s interpretation of the AAU survey data.
“As the national press has begun to question, the Final Report of the Task Force on Prevention of Sexual Assault draws a number of conclusions about final clubs that are not supported by the data obtained from the AAU Harvard Survey,” Porteus wrote.
A Washington Post op-ed by Atlantic writer Caitlin Flanagan, for instance, claimed that “it would be almost impossible to concoct a more meaningless statistic” than the 47 percent figure cited in the Task Force’s final report. Flanagan argued that the figure could refer to incidents that did not occur on final club properties or happened regardless of a student’s participation in a final club event.
Hyman, who penned the report and the letter following the AAU Survey results’ fall release, defended the task force’s recommendations in an email to the Crimson, writing that they “were based not only on the AAU sexual conduct survey, but also on the extensive qualitative data gathered at scores of meetings with Harvard undergraduates.”
“The survey found that 47 percent of female Harvard College seniors participating in Final Club activities had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact compared to the campus-wide average of 31 percent,” Hyman wrote. “ This differential represents a very substantial increase in risk to female students, a finding that was amply confirmed in the data gathering sessions held in the College.   While the combined data shows that sexual assault has many antecedents--leading the Task Force to make a diversity of recommendations--the Task Force  could hardly ignore the significantly heightened risk to female students that was associated with Final Club activities.”
In a statement to the Crimson on April 12, then-graduate president of the Porcellian club Charles M. Storey ’82 also criticized the report for conflating “the issues of sexual assault, gender equity, and exclusivity.”
Storey has since apologized for his comments and resigned from his role on the Porcellian’s graduate board.
By the end of the academic year, Khurana will present a plan, which will include specific policies on final clubs, to address the suggestions in the Hyman report.

In response to recent thefts in River Houses and Harvard Yard dormitories, the Undergraduate Council’s Student Life Committee issued a memo last week expressing support for exterior security cameras outside of residence halls.

The Harvard University Police Department has responded to numerous reported thefts since late January, according to HUPD Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano. Most recently, Catalano issued a community advisory statement Monday alerting students about 10 more incidents of reported theft that took place this past weekend.
Two iPads, 13 laptops, and “other miscellaneous items” were stolen during the weekend, Catalano wrote. In eight of the incidents, residents left the door to their room open or unsecured, and in three incidents, residents occupied the rooms when the suspect or suspects entered.
Priyanka R. Narayan ’18, whose laptop was stolen Saturday from her room at 20 DeWolfe St., said the suspect or suspects also took her roommate’s computer and keys. She said that at least one resident of her room was present when the theft occurred.
“I feel like it’s also really bad that we can’t feel secure in where we live,” Narayan said. “I’m terrified someone’s going to take my new computer now, too.”
An average of about 90 laptops are stolen on campus each year, according to HUPD’s website.
In a unanimous 11-0 decision, the Student Life Committee voted to voice support for adding security cameras to upperclassman Houses and freshman dorms, on the condition that the cameras record exterior activity exclusively, are not “actively monitored for the purpose of student discipline,” and are used only to identify suspects and discourage crime.
“Given the urban setting of our campus where crimes are prone to occur, it makes sense to take reasonable steps to promote student safety and security,” the memo states.
“The conditions we came up with were born out of a desire to improve the safety of the Houses and dorms without compromising student privacy,” Quincy House Representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 wrote in an email.
Narayan said she believes security cameras could reduce the likelihood of future incidents of theft.
“I think it would at least deter theft if they are students, because they would know that cameras would see them,” she said. “It would definitely make me feel secure.”
Students currently have two ways to register their laptops for recovery in case of theft, according to HUPD’s website. Students may either register their laptops online through the HUPD website or through Absolute Software’s LoJack for Laptops. HUPD keeps a database with the serial number, make, and model of each registered computer, while LoJack uses technology embedded in computers that allows users to remotely lock their device and erase confidential information.
Catalano declined to comment further.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to allocate more than $8,000 to various initiatives during its general meeting Monday, although some votes prompted concerns that the UC was publicizing and funding events before formal approval.
Representatives passed a piece of legislation that allocated $2,500 to cover unanticipated costs for Project H, an event designed to foster “open, inclusive social initiatives.” The Council had already voted in February to allocate $2,500 to Project H. The additional funding will cover costs for decorations and other supplies that exceeded the project’s previous budget.
“It was super successful,” UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair Madeleine H. Stern ’18 said. “We had 700 people come throughout the course of the night.”
Given that the event took place last Friday, the committee had already spent the money it was asking the Council to allocate, sparking debate among some UC representatives.
Although representatives overwhelmingly agreed the event was a success, several raised concerns over the practice of spending money before voting to allocate it. According to UC rules, any allocation of funds from the $75 student term bill fee must first be approved by a vote of the full Council.
“I am concerned that money was spent of the UC’s without anyone’s voting to do so,” former UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 said.
Stern clarified that, given that the last-minute costs took place between UC meetings, a full Council vote would have been infeasible.
Steinberg-Otter suggested that the UC could avoid similar future situations by initially taking funds from the UC’s Operations budget, which does not require full Council approval, and then voting to re-allocate funds at the next meeting.
“I would love for there to be a further discussion about how we can deal with this,” Stern said.
A piece of legislation to fund Club 1636, an event designed to “provide open and alternative late night social programming,” prompted similar objections. Crimson Yard Representative Jack Kelley ’19 said that UC representatives had already begun publicizing the event before funding was allocated.
“I think it’s important to keep in mind that we shouldn’t [publicize] things or allocate money that we haven’t approved as a Council together,” Kelley said.
Acknowledging Kelley’s concern, UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 clarified that the event would take place regardless of whether the Council votes to fund it. The Council ultimately voted unanimously to fund the event.
The UC also allocated $1,500 to fund a “De-Stress  Fest” in collaboration with the College Events Board, and $900 to help fund the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response’s Denim Day event as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
In addition to voting at the meeting to endorse the web-based Summer Playbook initiative, the Council also allocated $865 to student organization Act on a Dream as part of an unplanned grants pack. UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said the grant was not included in previous grant allocations due to a committee error.
UC Secretary Anna T. Wechsler ’18 also announced at the meeting that the Council’s Executive Board voted to remove Ivy Yard representative Dennis K. Kim ’19 from the UC due to attendance-related reasons. Council rules stipulate that representatives cannot miss more than three general meetings, three committee meetings, or a combination of two of each.

The Foodbetter Harvard Initiative held a cornucopia of events last week, ranging from panels with celebrity chefs to a sustainability and innovation fair, intended to promote conversations about healthy and sustainable food choices on campus.
First organized in 2014 and sponsored by the Office of the Executive Vice President, the Foodbetter Harvard Initiative is a University-wide collaboration between the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, Harvard University Dining Services, the Food Literacy Project, and the Office for Sustainability.
Colin B. Durrant, communications director for the Office for Sustainability, said this year’s Foodbetter programming was meant to focus more on including perspectives from across the University.
“This year’s celebration builds on earlier grassroots efforts in that it’s a true University-wide, multidisciplinary, One Harvard event, focused on mobilizing and bringing the entire Harvard community of students, faculty, staff together with our neighboring communities to have a conversation around food,” Durrant said.
On the first day of the two-day summit, Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office for Sustainability, addressed ways in which students can more actively engage with the topic of sustainability as part of her opening remarks.
A keynote conversation, which took place in the Science Center Plaza, included a panel of chefs, restaurant owners, and a professor of epidemiology and nutrition. Panelists explained their journeys with food, touching on the global health crisis and the future of sustainable culinary arts.
On the second day, attendees were able to explore the Sustainability and Innovation Fair, which featured businesses ranging from a solar energy specialist to local food enterprises, cooking student demonstrations, and speed lectures on innovations in food and food systems.
Grace E. Dhanraj '16, who spoke in a lecture on Foods of the Future, discussed her work with Bloom Bakery. Dhanraj created Bloom Bakery based on the goal of incorporating jellyfish into food to alleviate damage caused by jellyfish overpopulation in the marine ecosystem.
“I think the whole event was great for making students aware about all of the amazing projects that are taking place at Harvard and around Cambridge,” Dhanraj said.
The festival concluded with a Harvard Student Panel, featuring students from organizations like the Student Mental Health Liaisons, the Food Literacy Project, and the Undergraduate Council. In an interview after the panel, Emma V.R. Noyes ’18, an inactive magazine editor and an editorial director at food website Spoon University Harvard, praised the festival for highlighting the University’s efforts to make healthier, more sustainable dishes.
“We complain a lot about dining hall food,” Noyes said. “Yet we do nothing about our complaints, because the food is there and it has already been paid for. Before we can make any meaningful changes, we need to recognize how good we already have it. Then, we have a base upon which we can build."

General Motors announced on Friday its nomination of former Harvard Management Company President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo to stand for election to its board of directors.
If elected at GM’s annual shareholders meeting in June, Mendillo, who led HMC and its management of Harvard's endowment from 2008 to 2014, will succeed retiring director and former GM executive Stephen J. Girsky.
“Jane brings to the Board a demonstrated track record of performance through her decades of investment management experience,” GM Chairman and CEO Mary T. Barra wrote in the company’s press release. “She has generated proven results through periods of rapidly changing market conditions. Her experience and leadership will be especially valuable as we continue to strengthen our investor outreach and engagement.”
This month, over a year after leaving her position at HMC at the end of 2014, Mendillo joined the board of directors of Lazard, an investment banking firm in New York, N.Y.
Despite earning nominations to seats on two blue-chip boards in recent months, Mendillo’s track record as HMC’s chief has been a source of concern due to poor endowment returns during her tenure leading the institution.
Mendillo took the reins at HMC in the summer of 2008, with the endowment at a record high of $36.9 billion. In her first fiscal year at the helm, the endowment, largely invested in private equity and real estate assets, tumbled as those holdings declined in value because of the financial crisis. The endowment was worth $26.0 billion at the start of FY 2010.
Mendillo worked in recovery mode for the remainder of her tenure.
Since leaving the Harvard Management Company, unlike previous endowment chiefs, Mendillo has chosen to remain out of the investment business, instead serving as an adviser to for-profit and not-for-profit institutions.
In addition to her new role at Lazard and nomination to join GM's board, Mendillo has joined the boards of trustees of the Berklee College of Music, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Boston Foundation.
Having worked at HMC for 15 years until 2002, Mendillo rejoined Harvard in 2008 after a six-year tenure as the chief investment officer at Wellesley College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira said he was “more concerned now” about the spread of mumps on campus than at any other point during the outbreak, worrying that a recent spike in the number of confirmed cases could adversely affect Commencement.
As of Monday there were 40 confirmed cases of mumps at Harvard and slightly less than a dozen students currently in isolation, according to Lindsey Baker, a spokesperson for HUHS. In an email sent to undergraduates Friday, Barreira indicated that there had been 34 cases of mumps at the time.
“I’m actually more concerned now than I was during any time of the outbreak, I have to say,” Barreira said. “I’m desperate, I’m desperate to get students to take seriously that they shouldn’t be infecting one another.”

The rapid spread of mumps could affect Commencement and other end-of-the-semester activities if more individuals become exposed to the virus, Barreira said.
“The concern is that if there’s a spike this week, that means those students expose others, so now we’re looking at a potential serious interruption to Commencement for students,” Barreira said. “Students will get infected, and then go into isolation.”
Mumps, a viral illness that affects the salivary glands, is generally considered rare. Incoming freshmen are required to have received the MMRV vaccination, a vaccine commonly used to prevent the incidence of mumps.
Barreira said at one point after spring break, there were only two cases of mumps at Harvard and no students in isolation. “[T]hen all of a sudden we had 11 in isolation,” he said.
Per Harvard policy, students who have tested positive for mumps must be isolated from other people for a period of five days. Currently, students with the virus are isolated in either the Harvard Inn or students’ own homes, if they live nearby.
Barreira notified students of the first confirmed case of mumps on March 1. Since then, that number has steadily increased, and College administrators warned students traveling during spring break to practice good hygiene and avoid public transportation if they worried they may have been in contact with mumps. In March, nearby colleges such as Tufts University and Boston University reported having confirmed cases of mumps on their campuses. Colleges across the country, such as the University of Dayton, Miami University, and Indiana University have also reported confirmed cases of mumps.
Before spring break, Harvard had isolated students with mumps at the Harvard Inn without notifying other residents—primarily visiting students—because of the University’s policy of protecting patient privacy. Once students were alerted that individuals with the virus were in the same building, they raised concerns over transparency in communication.
Barreira said the increase in incidence of mumps on Harvard’s campus can be attributed to students taking inadequate precautions.
“Students are not acting in a responsible way, knowingly exposing other students to the virus,” Barreira said. “It’s both disappointing and frustrating because I thought we were on the decline.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 27, 2016 at 9: 57 a.m.
Given ongoing construction to the Smith Campus Center that will include work in the evenings and on weekends, Harvard University Health Services will temporarily relocate its after hours urgent care services to the Law School’s Pound Hall.
In an email to Harvard affiliates on Monday, HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira and University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote that HUHS “will be required to temporarily move urgent care services (which are open 24 hours a day, every day) to an alternate location after regular business hours,” citing the construction on the Smith Center, which is the main location for HUHS.
While searching for the new outpatient care space, Barreira said he and his staff “looked at everything,” even a potential travel trailer. The decision to select Pound Hall—currently home to the Law School’s HUHS clinic—came because of the building’s pre-existing license from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
Barreira added that Pound Hall’s proximity to the College and the Quad made the space ideal for an overnight care center, and that the influx of College students should not overwhelm the resources available at Pound Hall.
“This is the most accessible option to the College population,” Barreira said. “The priority in my mind was a location that would be the least disruptive to the College population.”
HUHS has not yet decided on a date to open Pound Hall as an overnight care center, as they must obtain an additional license from the Department of Public Health to use the building as an overnight care location, as opposed to a solely daytime clinic. Barreira said he predicts the transition to begin in June, as long as the University’s request for a license is expedited.
Following this predicted schedule, according to Barreira, the clinic at the Smith Campus Center will likely open in about two years, coinciding with the end of construction at the Smith Center.
“The potential shut down in utilities on nights and weekends is expected to continue as long as the construction is going on, so it didn’t feel reasonable or even plausible that we could set an earlier time and stick to it,” Barreira said.
Meanwhile, a renovation of the Smith Campus Center is in full swing.

CORRECTION: April 27, 2016
A previous version of this article indicated that Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira looked at "everything" for the new inpatient care space. In fact, he did so for the new outpatient space.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team took care of its business over the weekend to stay alive in Red Rolfe play. The Crimson took three of four from Brown to stay two games back of Yale as both teams head into a pair of decisive four-game series next weekend.
Harvard took both of Saturday’s one-run games before the teams split 6-0 affairs to close out the weekend. The Crimson (15-21, 8-8 Ivy) was able to eliminate the Bears (12-22, 6-10) from postseason contention while Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth all remain mathematically alive for the division crown.
“We put ourselves in a hole early on, but once that happened, it doesn’t do a whole lot of good to dwell on that, you have to learn from it, move on and I think we’ve done a good job of that,” sophomore utilityman Matt Rothenberg said. “We’ve got a shot with a weekend to play.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 0
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, as the team was able to find the offense it was missing in Sunday’s first game. Harvard put up a run in the second, three in the third, and two in the fourth, and strong pitching throughout allowed the Crimson to coast to a decisive victory to end the weekend.
Freshman Kevin Stone turned in the best performance of his collegiate career, tossing eight innings of scoreless ball while striking out eight. Stone surrendered just four hits to pick up his third win of the season. Senior Shaun Rubin got through a four-batter ninth inning to secure the victory.
“That was great to watch,” co-captain Matt Sanders said. “He pitched incredibly well. As a freshman, it’s a tall order to come into Harvard and be asked to be one of the four starting pitchers. He’s done a great job of trying to improve every single weekend and you really saw it [Sunday].”
The meat of the Harvard order anchored the breakthrough third inning. Freshman Patrick Robinson and Rothenberg both doubled as two of four base hits in the frame. Four of Harvard’s 10 hits in the game were doubles.
BROWN 6, HARVARD 0 (SEVEN INNINGS)
Brown jumped on Crimson starter Ian Miller to produce the offense it lacked throughout Saturday. Senior left fielder Jake Levine and senior first baseman Kevin Guthrie drove in the only runs the Bears would need in the third. Lefty Austin French stymied the Harvard offense, as the senior went all seven innings, striking out 11 and surrendering just five hits.
Senior Mitch Klug and sophomore Conor Quinn were the only Crimson hitters to record extra base hits but neither were able to score. Miller struggled with command issues, as the second-year issued five walks in his three and two-thirds innings of work.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 3
A three-run first inning propelled Harvard, as the hosts never conceded the lead after falling behind by a run to begin the game. Freshman Ben Skinner set the tone from the get-go, doubling and coming around to score to open the game. After Patrick McColl and John Fallon both reached on walks, the Crimson manufactured two runs via a wild pitch and a fielder’s choice.
From there, senior Sean Poppen was dominant on the mound. The Chesapeake, Va., native threw seven innings, conceding just two runs while striking out 10. Poppen shut down Brown in the road half of the seventh to bridge the gap to the bullpen. Senior Nick Scahill slammed the door on the Bears in the eighth and ninth to pick up his third save of the season.
HARVARD 2, BROWN 1 (SEVEN INNINGS)
Harvard eked out a one-run win to win the weekend’s first season as the hosts rode the arm of junior starter Nick Gruener. While both teams managed just five hits, the Crimson had the decisive one in the fifth. Freshman Trent Bryan doubled to begin the frame and a sac fly from senior Mitch Klug two batters later gave Harvard its decisive run.
Working with the lead in the sixth and seventh, Gruener was just as dominant as he was out of the gate. The Miami native allowed just one hit in the final two frames while striking out three. On the day, Gruener struck out seven of the 27 batters he faced.
“[Gruener and Poppen] have both been great, especially with the seven inning games,” Rothenberg said. “[Nick] having been able to throw the innings he has and pitch like he has really helps out our bullpen. Both of those guys have really set the tone for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into weekend play against Brown, Harvard softball sat just three games behind Dartmouth for the top spot in the Ivy League standings.
As a fly ball settled into the glove of freshman left fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer for the final out of the home series, the Crimson cut Dartmouth’s lead to a solitary game.
After an extra-innings opening tilt with the Bears on Saturday afternoon (16-21, 5-11 Ivy), Harvard (25-14, 13-3) dominated the rest of the series to pick up the sweep. The Crimson extended its winning streak to six games and is undefeated in 10 home games this season.
“We really want to defend the home turf, and it’s fun before a game to be around, have our fans, have our pregame mix, and really just have a great time,” senior catcher Rachel Halperin said.
HARVARD 11, BROWN 4
Harvard scored a combined nine runs in its final two turns at bat and capped off the weekend with a fourth win over the Bears.
Freshman Kathleen Duncan made the start on the mound for the Crimson to give the duo of junior Taylor Cabe and senior co-captain Morgan Groom a respite. However, after Brown led three innings into the game, coach Jenny Allard brought in Groom from the bullpen.
The senior held down the fort for Harvard in the final four frames, as the Crimson rallied to pull away with a comfortable margin of victory.
Junior Giana Panariello and senior Haley Davis each homered and drove in four runs, while freshman Meagan Lantz doubled and crossed the plate three times.
“I think we’re seeing the ball well,” Allard said. “I think we’re being patient at the plate….and I think we’re really staying positive in our at bats.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 2
The Bears struck early with two quick runs in the top of the first, but Harvard answered with three of its own in the bottom half and added three more to secure the victory.
The Crimson offense continued firing on all cylinders in Sunday’s opening game, as it scored six or more runs again.
Cabe went the full seven innings for the sixth time this season and picked up her 14th win, good enough for second in the Ancient Eight.
HARVARD 8, BROWN 0
Harvard only needed five innings to dispatch Brown in the back end of Saturday’s doubleheader.
The Crimson jumped on Brown junior Leah Nakashima in the early going, scoring six runs and forcing a pitching change with two outs in the second inning.
Cabe struck out five batters in five innings of work while only allowing two baserunners.
“I thought we came out strong,” Allard said. “Our pitchers did a wonderful job of each inning attacking the batter, getting the first out of each inning.
Panariello and freshmen Rhianna Rich and Elizabeth Shively each recorded two hits. Shively and Lantz went deep, their second and seventh long balls of the season, respectively.
HARVARD 7, BROWN 6
Through five innings, it appeared as though Harvard would pick up a comfortable win in the opening game of the weekend. An inning and a half later, however, the Crimson found itself locked in a 6-6 tie with the Bears.
Having scored three runs in the top of the seventh to bring the game to within one, Brown was down to its final out against freshman Sarah Smith. Right fielder Yeram Park kept the Bears’ hopes alive, as she homered to left to even the score.
Harvard wasted no time bringing the contest to a close in extra innings. In the top of the eighth, Groom came back into the game to replace Smith in the circle, and she worked out of a bases-loaded jam.
In the bottom half, the Crimson quickly loaded the bases with two singles and an intentional walk. Allard opted to pinch hit junior Catherine Callaway for co-captain Zoe Galindo, and the switch paid off. A fielder’s choice allowed Shively to cross home plate with the winning run.
“I think our team had a lot of fight,” Halperin said. “I think everyone really wanted that game, and so even when we ended up tied everyone was going to do everything they could to get that win.”

Angelina R. Massa '18 is an Applied Math concentrator living in Quincy House. She is in search of someone “fun,” “smart” and who has “good arms.” We sent her to visit the café and go on a tour at The Harvard Art Museums with Mark N. Goldman '18. He is a joint Chemistry and Physics concentrator who lives in Pforzheimer House. He will “maintain conversations at any cost” and was hoping his date would be “talkative” and “funny.”
Angelina: I got there on time, which I never do. I never go places on time so this was huge.
Mark: I was there first. [I thought that] there were a couple people it could have been.
Angelina: He had been sitting across the lobby I just didn’t know who he was. But then he came over… [probably] because I looked lost and confused.
Mark: I obviously thought she was really pretty... [She was] warm.
Angelina: He seemed really nice.
Angelina: It was really pretty, open and bright in the museum. We sat in the café for a little bit and talked.
Mark: We talked about her doing ballet [for thirty hours a week during high school]. She was crazy into it.
Angelina: He’s on the football team so we talked about how he wakes up at five for six AM practice.
Mark: We talked about her wanting to be an athletic trainer… and how she switched her major to applied math.
Angelina: I was surprised he is from Brooklyn… most of the people I know from Brooklyn are not that nice, but he was super courteous… [At one point], he took out his phone to look something up that we were talking about, but then he put it away and said ‘I shouldn’t be on my phone…’ We [realized] the tour wasn’t for another 40 minutes so we decided to look around.
Mark: I had had to do an essay [for Expos] about one of the paintings [in the museum], but I couldn’t remember where it was or really what it was so we just aimlessly wandered the second floor. She teased me for not being able to remember it. It was only a three-page paper! … We accidentally missed [the tour]. We were too intent on finding this thing.
Angelina: Then, we ran into his friend who said we should go to the first floor… Someone told me there would be a lot of Picassos. We were on a Picasso hunt for a while.
Mark: [We decided] to guess which one was a Picasso [before we read the label next to it].
Angelina: I liked that [the date] was at a museum…it gives you things to talk about… I mean I can talk a lot, but it’s nice to have things to comment on…we made jokes about art.
Mark: It got better as it progressed…I told an Office joke as we were playing the Picasso game…I knew that she knew The Office. We had talked about that.
Angelina: I’m friends with anyone who likes The Office.
Mark: I had a great time… I think she had a good time too…
Angelina: It wasn’t awkward at all; it was totally normal; we talked for two hours straight… it was a fun way to make a friend… Shout out to Casey Durant, my blockmate, for signing me up.
Mark: I just thought [a blind date] would be an interesting experience… it could have been anyone. I think that is interesting in and of itself. At least once, you have to try it.
Do you want to try it? Mark did say he would “spread the word” to his teammates, so what are you waiting for? The Flyby Matchmaker is also considering setting up a double date, so why not find a friend and fill the form out together!?
XOXO,
The Flyby Matchmaker

As we reach the finish line of a year full of aggressive pseting and regrettably getting in touch with your inner Lamonster, you may have just forgotten how to be a normal human in a social setting. Especially all you freshmen out there, who probably still haven’t quite figured out how to non-awkwardly navigate the social scene. Freshman Formal quickly approaching (read, it’s tomorrow) and Flyby’s here to help prevent you from making a fool of yourself.
The “date event” myth:Freshman Formal is not a date event. Trust us, even if your roommates say otherwise. For the stubborn ones out there who refuse to take this advice, we have some advice for you to nonchalantly get your date without getting brutally rejected . Ask the cutie in your Stat 104 section what dinner time slot they signed up. Be casual about it. A simple: “wow, I think I’m going to get my Pset done by six so I can go to the 7 p.m. dinner. How about you?” Smooth, we know.
Keep your Prom Dress at home:It’s true, the word formal can be a little misleading, but this does not mean that you should whip out your prom dress to go to berg. Instead, go for a more “I woke up like this” look. An old cocktail dress or a casual long dress will do. Chances are you have already taken pictures with your prom dress and they are all over your Instagram, Facebook, and Tinder profile anyway, so best to not be known as an outfit repeater.
The “tent” issue:You would think that, after paying $25 for a ticket, freshman formal would be held at the Charles Hotel. But no. Instead, formal will take place under a tent in the Science Center plaza. Yes, the same setup as the Farmer’s Market. Chances are the heat, humidity, and high testosterone levels will leave you looking less than ideal. Flyby recommends that you channel your inner basicness to utilize time before the formal begins to get a quality insta picture.
The mumps struggle:For those of you hoping that freshman formal is almost as sloppy as First Chance Dance, think again. The mumps are very much still a thing. If you see a long-lost entryway mate or that kid from Expos in the fall, go for a high five instead of a hug. If you find yourself with the girl/boy of your dreams in your arms and can’t resist the urge to kiss them, take standard precaution and check their salivary glands first.
There you have it, follow these simple guidelines and Freshman Formal will be everything you ever dreamed it would be. Or, for upperclassmen, you can now laughably look back upon all the mistakes your freshman self made.
