After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 900 Harvard Law School affiliates signed a statement denouncing Sen. Ted Cruz — a Republican from Texas who graduated from the Law School in 1995 — for contesting the results of the recent presidential election.
In the months since President-elect Joe R. Biden defeated President Donald J. Trump, the Justice Department discovered no instances of widespread voter fraud. Nonetheless, Trump and his allies have continued to falsely claim that he won the election, including in dozens of failed lawsuits.
On Jan. 2, Cruz and 10 other Senate Republicans announced their intent to object to the certification of some votes in the Electoral College, calling for an “emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states.”
The Law School statement condemns Cruz for the objection, stating that his “false claims of voter fraud” and his choice to contest votes are “utterly inconsistent” with his oath of office.
“We, the undersigned members of the Harvard Law School community, unequivocally condemn the attempt of fellow graduate Ted Cruz ’95 and any of his supporters to undermine democracy and our Constitution by improperly challenging the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as President and Vice-President of the United States,” it reads.
Christopher M. “Chris” Kelly — a former policy advisor to President Bill Clinton and a 1997 Law School graduate — collaborated with fellow HLS alums Marvin Ammori and Katie “Kathryn” Biber to write the statement. Kelly said the influence of institutions such as Harvard Law inspired him to develop and circulate the petition.
“I think that graduates of law schools where the law has been made for years and where the Constitution is supposed to be respected needed to step forward and say, unequivocally, that this is a violation of constitutional oath, and it needs to be, at the very least, actively censured, called out,” he said.
Kelly wrote and circulated the statement prior to Jan. 6 — the date of the formal certification of Electoral College votes and the planned objection from Republicans like Cruz. Hundreds of affiliates signed on before that day.
On Jan. 6, while Congress carried out the vote, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The attack forced lawmakers to flee their chambers and left five dead.
Cruz condemned the violence on Capitol Hill, calling the events a “despicable act of terrorism and a shocking assault on our democratic system” in a Jan. 7 tweet.
Nonetheless, Kelly said he believes Cruz and fellow Sen. Josh D. Hawley (R-Mo.) should be expelled from office for complicity in fomenting violence.
“After Wednesday, I think that the only acceptable result of this — for Senator Cruz and for Senator Hawley, in particular — is expulsion from the Senate,” Kelly said. “The 14th Amendment contemplates that with a two-thirds vote, and I hope and expect that there will be a vote on that in the coming weeks.”
Law School professor Michael J. Klarman also condemned Cruz and Hawley in an email to The Crimson, characterizing their contention of electoral votes as “an attempted coup against democracy, just as was the simultaneous storming of the Capitol by a Trump-incited mob.”
“Both were the logical culmination of the Republican Party’s two-decades-long assault upon democracy and of the big lie of voter fraud propagated by GOP leaders and the right-wing media ecosystem,” Klarman wrote.
A spokesperson for Cruz declined to comment; a Hawley spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
San Jose, Calif. Mayor Sam T. Liccardo, a Law School graduate and signatory of the statement, said he hopes the petition encourages Cruz to reflect on how his actions may have led to the riot.
“I certainly hope that Senator Cruz is taking some time to reflect on how his conduct may have intentionally or unintentionally led to this result,” he said.
Anthony Arnold ’04, who also signed the statement, said he found Cruz’s actions particularly disappointing given his status as a fellow alum of the Law School.
“Someone who has training from a prestigious institution like Harvard Law School shouldn’t be lending that prestige — or that kind of stamp, or imprimatur of credibility — to something like an insurrection and something like a coup of our government,” he said.
Anthony O. Pergola Jr., a former Law School classmate of Cruz, wrote in an email that he signed the statement because he felt a “personal responsibility” to “implore Ted to choose integrity over his unbridled ambition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For David A. Tanner II ’22, the decision to receive the Covid-19 vaccine was “pretty straightforward.”
Tanner, who works in a coronavirus testing laboratory in West Virginia, qualified to receive the Pfizer vaccine early as a frontline healthcare worker.
Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization in December for two coronavirus vaccines — one produced jointly by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech and one produced by Moderna Therapeutics — several million Americans have been vaccinated against Covid-19, while the rest await their turn.
Though the federal government deferred to states to decide who receives the first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published recommendations encouraging states to prioritize healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents in the first phase of vaccination distribution. The CDC suggested that subsequent phases focus on frontline essential workers, people aged 65 years or older, people aged 16 or older with underlying medical conditions, and other essential workers.
Tanner, one among the several Harvard students who have been vaccinated, said receiving the vaccine was “a bit of a game of cat and mouse” due to delayed communication.
“We knew that we were going to be getting it for several weeks before we actually did. It was just a question of when,” he said. “My boss was working with the National Guard, people at the [federal] health department, state health directors, just to kind of make sure that there was enough available for us.”
Tanner said it was rewarding to receive the vaccine after months of handling Covid-19 test swabs.
“To be able to top it off with this vaccine at the end, knowing that after all this time I was working with a really dangerous virus this entire time and I was exposing myself, it’s a nice payoff to be able to have a little bit more of a sense of security,” he said.
Jessica P. Miller ’21, who took a leave of absence during the fall semester to work as an emergency medical technician in her home state of West Virginia, also said her decision to receive the Pfizer vaccine was “really obvious.”
Miller said she posted photos of her vaccination on Facebook to help quell concerns about the safety of the vaccine. She said she hopes once the vaccine is widely available, a “bandwagon effect” will encourage skeptics to get vaccinated.
“It’s a lot more obvious for [healthcare workers] to get it,” she said. “Hopefully by the time it gets to the general public, they’ll be like, ‘Oh, all these people have taken it and they’re fine.’”
Jennifer J. Near ’22-’23 also qualified for the coronavirus vaccine as a patient-facing frontline worker. Near, who is spending a gap year working as a medical lab technician at an urgent care clinic in Alpharetta, Georgia, received her first dose of the Moderna vaccine in December.
Near said studying the mRNA technology behind the Moderna vaccine allayed her initial concerns about the vaccine’s safety. Unlike conventional vaccines that use a weakened or inactivated form of a virus, mRNA vaccines instruct cells to create a harmless protein that induces an immune response.
“Since the Covid-19 virus is so new, I’ve had reservations about essentially putting that into my body,” Near said. “When I had gone and read the science and realized it’s an mRNA vaccine — it’s a lot safer than typical vaccines are because you’re not putting a weakened form of the actual virus — I had no reservations after that.”
Near said she experienced no side effects from the vaccine other than a mild fever.
Rafael Treviño ’22 said he qualified to receive the Moderna vaccine in his home state of Texas because he has two underlying medical conditions that may place him at greater risk for severe illness from coronavirus. He said he identified a clinic nearby that vaccinates people with Covid-19 comorbidities.
Texas residents 16 and older with one or more chronic health conditions that put them at risk for severe illness from Covid-19 currently qualify to receive the coronavirus vaccine, per a Texas Department of State Health Services website.
Treviño said that although the vaccine will provide him greater “peace of mind,” he intends to remain vigilant to prevent the spread of the virus.
“I’m still obviously going to be careful,” Treviño said. “I’m not gonna go out and start going out without a mask, like, ‘Oh, I only have a six percent chance of getting it,’ right? That six percent chance is still pretty scary.”
Similarly, Near said she will continue to practice preventative health measures, including social distancing and mask-wearing, even after receiving her second Moderna vaccine dose later this month.
“I haven’t changed anything in terms of my lifestyle, and I don’t think I will even after receiving the second dose until enough people are vaccinated and public health experts say that it’s okay to change the way we are currently living,” she said.
Unlike his vaccinated peers who know they have increased protection against Covid-19, Reese M. Caldwell ’22-’23 — who participated in the Pfizer vaccine’s phase three clinical trial — does not know whether he received the actual vaccine or a placebo.
Caldwell, who is working at a biotechnology company in New Haven, Conn. during his gap year, said a sense of duty prompted him to enroll at a local clinical trial site.
“I thought that it was important to do whatever I could,” he said. “There was a clinical trial site and they needed volunteers and so I felt it was natural to step up and help test it.”
Caldwell, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator, said he trusted the trial would be safe.
“I’ve been pretty well-versed in the development process and so I felt pretty confident going into it that these vaccines would work and that they’d be safe,” he said.
Pfizer is informing trial participants whether they received the vaccine or placebo in waves, starting with those at high risk for contracting or falling seriously ill with the disease, as determined by local authorities. Since he may be categorized as an essential worker, Caldwell said that he could be unblinded and given the vaccine as early as this month, in the case that he was in the placebo group.
“Everyone is going to have to wait a while to get unblinded and get the vaccine if they’re on placebo,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student leaders at the Institute of Politics lauded the IOP’s decision to remove U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) from its Senior Advisory Committee on Tuesday.
Stefanik’s removal was announced in a letter penned by Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf to members of the committee on Tuesday morning. More than 750 Harvard affiliates signed a petition last week urging the IOP to sever ties with Stefanik for “improperly challenging” the congressional certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory and “enabling violence” during Wednesday’s Capitol Hill riot that left five people dead.
Ryan Zhang ’21, the former chair of the IOP’s Policy Program, said he signed the petition calling for Stefanik’s removal and believes that the IOP’s decision upholds the organization’s values.
“I was reassured that the IOP would be upholding its founding ideals and those of the country,” Zhang said.
Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21, another former chair of the Policy Program who also signed the petition, said she believes the petition played an integral role in encouraging IOP leaders to consider Stefanik’s dismissal.
“I’m actually fairly confident that this petition raised an issue that either they were not previously aware of or one that they had not really known the true support for until the petition was given to them,” Srinivasan said. “I have a lot of respect for the leadership to know that they did take student concerns into account and this decision was one way in which they did that.”
Srinivasan added that while she admired Stefanik’s previous contributions to the IOP, Stefanik’s false election claims represent a “pretty grievous error” that warrant her removal.
IOP president Menat N. Bahnasy ’22 said she is confident the IOP considered “all ideas and concerns” from Harvard affiliates before reaching a decision about Stefanik’s committee membership.
“This decision wasn’t about partisan politics in any sense,” Bahnasy said. “The IOP is always going to remain committed to actively seeking and uplifting diverse perspectives and bridging divides.”
Srinivasan said that she likewise views the IOP’s decision as a nonpartisan measure of support for democracy.
“I cannot stress enough how much I believe that this is not a question of party support or a question of partisanship. This was primarily a question of integrity and of honor in our electoral system and a democracy,” Srinivasan said. “I think that that was the misstep — not that she supported any one candidate or any one party — but that she severely undermined our democracy along with the representatives and senators that did the same.”
Zhang said that he would welcome the appointment of another conservative official to the committee.
“I would have no objection to Elise Stefanik being replaced by another well-credentialed conservative. In fact, I would support it,” Zhang said.
Grace K. Bannister ’21, a former IOP director of membership, said she hopes leaders within the organization will aim to appoint another conservative official to replace Stefanik.
“I hope given that the majority of the Senior Advisory Committee are former or current elected officials of the Democratic Party that, in looking for a replacement or looking for future members of the committee, that they would look to try to find some people who are right of center — who have been exemplary public servants,” Bannister said.
Following the announcement of her removal, Stefanik posted a statement to her Twitter account claiming the decision was made in an effort to silence conservative viewpoints and “cower and cave to the woke Left.”
Zhang said reading Stefanik’s statement only strengthened his belief that the IOP made the right decision.
“I felt more convinced of my position after reading her statement,” Zhang said. “I don’t agree with her response. I don’t think that we’re silencing conservative voices. I think that all voices liberal or conservative need to respect facts.”
In addition to removing Stefanik from the Senior Advisory Committee, IOP spokesperson Kelsey A. Donohue wrote in an emailed statement that the IOP will no longer offer a position with Stefanik’s congressional office through its Director’s Internship program.
“The IOP will not offer a placement through the Director’s Internship program with Rep. Stefanik’s Washington, D.C. congressional office this summer,” Donohue wrote. “The IOP is in the process of evaluating additional internship opportunities for students this coming summer and will update the Director Internship offering in the coming weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eleven Harvard Law School student organizations have signed a statement calling for administrators to denounce what they characterize as “highly offensive, discriminatory, and violent statements in online posts” by Law School professor Adrian C. Vermeule ’90.
Addressed to five Law School deans, the statement — signed by organizations including the Harvard Parity Project, the Equal Democracy Project, and the Black Law Students Association, among others — describes Vermeule’s digital rhetoric as “harmful to democracy” and “unbelievably divisive,” with a particular emphasis on his recent allegations of election fraud.
The statement urges Law School administrators to condemn Vermeule’s “spread of inaccurate conspiracy theories about the election” and conduct an investigation to determine whether Vermeule is “spreading misinformation or discriminatory content in his classes.” It also calls for the creation of at least two sections of HLS 2000: “Administrative Law” — a class Vermeule teaches — per semester, and a guarantee that first-year law students will not be required to take a course with Vermeule.
“To work at Harvard Law School is to be granted a platform and a level of legitimacy,” the statement reads. “Prof. Vermeule is abusing this platform in order to undermine democracy and delegitimize the results of the election.”
An appendix following the statement contains dozens of screenshots of Vermeule’s tweets — many of which he has since deleted — organized into categories that include “Election Disinformation,” “Offensive and Violent Statements,” “Religious Intolerance,” and “Anti-LBGTQ+,” among others.
In several tweets since the election, Vermeule has thrown weight behind President Donald J. Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud, according to the screenshots. “Lol the election isn’t over until Team Joe fixes up your ballot for you,” he wrote in one tweet.
Vermeule has come under fire for his online rhetoric before. In February, he sparked outrage after posting a tweet comparing attendees of the Summit on Principle Conservatism to concentration camp detainees.
In response to the petition, Vermeule wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that, though he supports the right to free speech, this freedom “does not include the right to falsely accuse people of illegal activity like discrimination and violence.”
“I take this attack on my character very seriously,” he wrote. “But I am quite confident that Harvard will uphold its longstanding moral and contractual commitments as an institution to protecting academic freedom and free speech.”
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal did not respond to a request for comment.
Nicole M. Rubin, who co-wrote the statement, said she felt motivated to take action after realizing several students felt uncomfortable with what Vermeule posted online. She said many students documented Vermeule’s rhetoric by taking screenshots of his tweets.
“Clearly, people felt that this was problematic enough that they took a screenshot, they saved it, and they knew where in their phone it was,” she said. “That’s how we got access to some of the tweets, actually, which made me feel even more inclined to write this letter.”
The Equal Democracy Project wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that it decided to sign the letter following a majority vote of members because Vermeule, “bolstered by his HLS pedigree,” was “contributing to the deterioration of our democracy.”
“While we recognize that Harvard affiliates speak on myriad matters, and that expressing differing opinions is crucial to both academic and democratic discourse, Professor Vermeule’s baseless suggestions of election fraud go beyond the pale of opining and merit condemnation,” the Equal Democracy Project statement reads.
Emma R. Leibowitz, a Law School student who helped write the statement, said though it is important for administrators to consider how online rhetoric influences national politics, they should be equally concerned with how it impacts students within the classroom.
“Your voice as a legal professor matters when you are saying election results were false,” Leibowitz said. “But your voice also matters when you’re a teacher in a classroom and need to ensure that there’s a safe learning environment for students. I think that this is the dual prong of our point.”
Rubin highlighted that, rather than punish or censor Vermeule, the statement aims to hold faculty such as Vermeule accountable for their digital actions and ensure students can navigate a safe learning environment at the Law School.
“What we mainly want to stress is that this is about the harmful effects that this may have on students,” she said. “It is not about censorship, and it is not about punishment — none of the things that we asked for are punitive. We asked for the University to denounce what he’s been saying.”
“We’ve played a really foundational role in shaping the leadership of this country,” Rubin added. “Therefore, I think that it is the responsibility of the University, and specifically the Law School, to set forth what the expectations are and what the Law School stands for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As House Democrats prepare to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time as early as Wednesday, several Harvard Law School faculty said the second impeachment is more likely to be successful than the first.
Following the events of Jan. 6 — during which a violent pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol building, prompting an evacuation of government officials — House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment Monday against President Donald J. Trump on the grounds of “incitement of insurrection.”
The push has since received support from several Republican lawmakers, including House GOP third-ranking member Liz L. Cheney.
Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen said a key motivation for impeaching Trump is to prevent him from holding elected office in the future.
“There certainly is one concrete purpose, which is that if he is convicted by the Senate, the Senate can also choose, upon conviction, to strip him of any ability to run for office again,” she said. “And that is a possibility that will be appealing to many people who really believe that the offenses he has committed should disqualify him from holding office, particularly in light of his talk of running again in 2024.”
In an email to The Crimson, Law School professor Michael J. Klarman said one reason Democrats may be pursuing impeachment is to require elected Republican officials to take a public position on the president’s actions.
“I suspect the real reason to pursue impeachment is to force Republicans in Congress to go on record defending or criticizing the president,” Klarman wrote. “The fact of the matter is that 94 percent of Republicans voted to re-elect Trump, over 70 percent of them think he actually won an election that is being stolen from him, and equal numbers of Republicans approve and disapprove of the mob’s effort to rush the Capitol last week.”
Barring Trump from being elected to office in the future “would not be a trivial accomplishment,” he added.
Given the widespread condemnation of Trump following Wednesday’s events, Law School professor Kenneth W. Mack predicted the House of Representatives will “complete its impeachment proceedings before the end of Trump’s presidency.”
According to Mack, the current push boasts considerable support from representatives across the political spectrum in contrast to last year’s impeachment proceedings.
“Unlike in the previous impeachment of President Trump, if there is in fact a Senate proceeding, that Senate proceeding is likely to get some additional Republican support in favor of some measure of discipline for President Trump that was not there last time,” he said.
Mack added that impeachments are meant to reflect public opinion and protect constituents from leaders unfit for office.
“Impeachment has always been a popular remedy — ‘popular’ as in it was intended to be the voice of the people against dictatorial or corrupt government officials,” Mack said. “This particular impeachment in the House, should it go through, appears to have much more popular support than the impeachment last year. And that’s quite noteworthy.”
Law School professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, who also serves as dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, wrote in an email that the mob that stormed the Capitol did so at President Trump’s “bidding.”
“There should be no question that this attempt to impede the will of the people and the lawful transfer of power constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors,” she wrote. “Donald Trump must be held accountable for his actions using the tools of impeachment and removal laid out in the Constitution. The rule of law is at stake.”
