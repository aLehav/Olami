After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a review of Douglas Waller’s “Wild Bill Donovan: The Spymaster Who Created the O.S.S. and Modern American Espionage” that appeared in The New Yorker, Harvard Professor Louis Menand presented a very negative portrait of Office of Strategic Services founder Major General William J. Donovan and discounted the significant contribution the O.S.S.—predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. Special Operations forces—made to America’s victory in World War II.
Donovan recruited some of Harvard’s leading scholars and alumni to serve in the O.S.S.  They include Cora DuBois, H. Stuart Hughes, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Robert Lee Woolf, Crane Brinton, John Clive, Carleton Coon, John K. Fairbank, Gordon Brown, Franklin Ford, Henry Murray, William Langer, Hugh Montgomery, and Fisher Howe.
These scholars served in the O.S.S. Research and Analysis Branch that, according to Menand’s article, "was transferred to the State Department—where it was quickly abolished."  In fact, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research proudly traces its origins to its O.S.S. predecessor.
Menand writes that “most of what came before and after [Donovan’s O.S.S. service] was failure and frustration.”  Prior to World War II, Donovan earned the Medal of Honor in World War I, served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney General, as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, as an advisor to President Roosevelt, as a candidate for governor of New York, and as a leading attorney.  Following World War II, the plan he created for a post-World War II O.S.S. was used to create the C.I.A.  President Eisenhower appointed him as ambassador to Thailand.  Donovan remains the only American to win our nation’s four highest military honors.  His time onstage, far from brief as Menand contends, lasted from World War I to the Cold War.
Menand dismisses O.S.S. successes as "minor exceptions.”  Such successes include negotiating the early surrender of the German army in Northern Italy that saved untold thousands of lives and shortened the war in Europe, the valuable intelligence gathered in advance of Operations Torch and Overlord, the accomplishments of Detachment 101 in Burma, which was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation by President Eisenhower, its Operational Groups, forerunners of today's U.S. Special Operations forces, which Donovan said “performed some of the bravest acts of the war”; its assistance to resistance groups throughout Europe, and the recruitment of Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat who was America's greatest Nazi spy.  Following World War II, intelligence collected by the O.S.S. was used to prosecute Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg.
Donovan’s alleged recklessness cited by Menand includes his participation in several invasions. (He also went behind enemy lines in Burma.)  His aide, Ned Putzell, said that Donovan was "unwilling to ask anyone to take a risk that he himself would not take." In an organization whose personnel volunteered for the most dangerous missions of World War II, one can only imagine the powerful effect that Donovan's example had on those who served under his command. Donovan made it clear that he was willing to risk his life, not just the lives of others.
The O.S.S. was by no means a perfect.  In his 1945 farewell address, Donovan said that "We were not afraid to make mistakes because we were not afraid to try things that had not been tried before."  Facing the grave threat posed to the United   States by Nazi Germany and our lack of a centralized intelligence service at the beginning of World War II, one can hardly fault Donovan and the O.S.S. for its willingness to take risks, even if it meant failure. Donovan frequently told O.S.S. personnel that they "could not succeed without taking chances” or engaging in what he termed “calculated recklessness.” An ideal O.S.S. candidate was described as a “Ph.D. who could win a bar fight” and Donovan said that he would “rather have a young lieutenant with enough guts to disobey a direct order than a colonel too regimented to think and act for himself.”
Menand cites Waller’s conclusion that “Donovan’s operation did nothing to shorten the war.”  This is incorrect.  General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, said of the O.S.S-aided resistance that “without their great assistance, the liberation of France and the defeat of the enemy in western Europe would have consumed a much longer time and meant greater losses to ourselves.”
In assessing Donovan, I would recommend repeating the words of other World War II leaders who knew him well from their wartime service together.  Lord Mountbatten said that he doubted "whether any one person contributed more to the ultimate victory of the Allies than Bill Donovan.”   Upon learning of his death in 1959, President Eisenhower said: “We have lost the last hero.”

Arizona Governor Janet Brewer vetoed House Bill 2177 on April 18, which would have required presidential candidates to provide extensive proof that they were born in the United States before being able to run. This proof would then be reviewed by the Arizona Secretary of State before securing a place on the state’s ballot.  In similar news, pigs don’t fly, Harvard is a selective college, and aspiring presidential candidate Donald Trump’s hair is anything but natural.
Famously supported by Trump and by other believers in the “birther” movement, the proposed Arizona law was ideological in reasoning, a direct nod to repeatedly refuted rumors about President Obama’s eligibility to hold office. Furthermore, it was impractical in scale, violating the established electoral process in hopes of granting unprecedented power to a state in regard to federal elections. Sadly, HB 2177 is merely one bill among an embarrassing list of recent Tea Party-inspired legislature, suggesting that the radical right has gone much too far.
The distinctly radical implications of Representative Carl Seel’s “birther” bill led Governor Brewer, a Republican who approved Arizona’s controversial immigration law, to deem the proposed legislation “a bridge too far.” Like Seel, other far-right leaders face the challenge of translating lofty ideology into competent laws. The Tea Party’s major goals constitute repealing current Democratic policies and minimizing governance, neither of which entails proactive legislation. Since spending is to be avoided at all costs and government should be minimal, there is little left for a Tea Party representative to do after repealing health care reform and restoring every citizen’s right to use inefficient, incandescent light bulbs.
Consequently, many bills proposed since the Tea Party’s insurgence into state governments after last fall’s midterm election merely aim to propagate the movement’s unrealistic vision for a cultural transformation of America. These bills may fester in the containment of a Tea Party-majority district or state, but they surface in the context of a more moderate national dialogue as extreme and irrelevant. Montana’s House Bill 278 would grant the governor “authority to recruit, train, equip, certify, and activate” a statewide citizen militia. Proposed legislation in Georgia demands that debtors repay the state in silver and gold, and Kentucky legislators aspire to make the state a “coal sanctuary,” exempt from environmental protection laws. No wonder Tea Party legislation is shot down as easily as a moose in Sarah Palin’s backyard. Besides, should Montana enact its bill endorsing global warming as “beneficial” to the state, it remains unclear how citizens will benefit.
Tea Party supporters envision a nation where all white, U.S.-born men are endowed with certain inalienable rights to gas-guzzling trucks, guns, and health care debt. The current landscape of the United States is simply too far from this alarming ideal to fit the Tea Party’s mold. A political movement that caters almost exclusively to the Caucasian, rural, and isolated is hardly sustainable in a country that’s becoming increasingly Latino, urban, and connected. The party may be filled with ideas, but few of them are attainable, whetting the appetite of conservative ideologues without a means to deliver on its promises of a legendary, freedom-filled America.
The Tea Party has served up a potent brew of passionate discontent. Now it’s time to back it up with sensible, implementable legislation that will genuinely contribute to the well being of its constituents, or run the risk of falling out of favor. In the words of a visionary similarly steeped in emotional appeal, Winnie the Pooh, “A Proper Tea is much nicer than a Very Nearly Tea, which is one you forget about afterwards.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many seniors, a thesis is a rite of passage to graduation—a last accumulation of work that causes all-nighters in Lamont, camaraderie with fellow writers, and the due-date time stamp when so many can start enjoying their senior spring to the fullest. On a happier note, a thesis also represents an incredible opportunity to travel to a new place, immerse oneself in a new culture, and apply knowledge acquired over four years at Harvard to real-world settings.
In that light, I’d like to highlight three senior theses that bring a fresh perspective to different occurrences in the developing world.
Eeke L. de Milliano ’11, a government concentrator, wrote her thesis on the secessionist movements of two provinces—Katanga and Kasai—in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her thesis attempts to explain why Katanga continued to fight for independence from 1960 onward while Kasai quietly assimilated to the rest of the DRC. She found that Katanga’s secessionist desire primarily stemmed from the lack of its inter-regional connections. There weren’t as many options for people to have jobs outside of Katanga so the costs of secession were low and the potential benefits were high. To reach her final conclusion about the two provinces, de Milliano conducted 33 elite-level interviews in the capital city Kinshasa, along with those in Kasai and Katanga. She also distributed 200 surveys in the two provinces. “Though not speaking French was a challenge,” she admits, “I was surprised at everyone’s eagerness to talk with me and share his or her story.”
Nearby, Ahmed N. Mabruk ’11, a history concentrator and former Crimson news executive, was collecting his findings on the little known country of Equatorial Guinea. Mabruk had taken courses on Africa and wanted to write a thesis pertaining to a human rights issue, but he stumbled onto the country by chance when studying for an African map quiz. “For whatever reason, I was intrigued enough to Wiki search Equatorial Guinea—Spain’s only former Sub-Saharan African colony, and the only country in Africa whose official language is Spanish. And on that barely edited page, I realized I was onto something that hadn't before been explored.” His thesis investigated how the Claretian missionary group of Spain created conceptions of ethnicity between the Bubi and the Fang, the minority and majority indigenous groups of Equatorial Guinea, respectively. Ultimately, he found that the Claretians effectively gave the Bubi higher socio-economic status and political rank than the Fang throughout the colonial period. The ethnic tension that followed mounted to an alleged genocide against the Bubi by the first President of Equatorial Guinea, a Fang, after the country gained independence in 1968. Being mistaken for a Spanish expatriate, being denied access to Equatorial Guinea archives, and dealing with a disorderly bureaucracy were just a few of the many challenges Mabruk faced when conducting his research. He made some surprising findings: The former president of Equatorial   Guinea's Supreme Tribunal told Mabruk in an interview that there could be another ethnic war between the Bubi and the Fang in the next ten years.
Across the world, Kimberly Farrell ’11, a romance languages and literatures concentrator, was in Brazil researching her senior thesis on Brazil’s own World Cup in 2012, along with Olympic planning for 2016. “The purpose of my thesis was to shed light on two things” Farrell says. “First, on the processes that occur at the local level to plan for and execute these events and secondly on how these mega-events are viewed by the host population.” Mega-events have become “hallmarks of development” and “internationally acclaimed”: Clearly, it is important to pay attention to what is going on in Brazil right now. Farrell conducted 16 personal interviews with executives and employees working on World Cup planning, as well as an online public opinion survey that elicited 4,500 responses. She found the population of the Brazilian state Minas Gerais to be extremely excited by the promises of these mega events but very skeptical about their actual benefits due to the tumultuous recent past of their country. “This is a reflection of a history of corruption or let-downs from the government so they don't really trust that they will be able to personally benefit from these events even though they will be beneficial from the city overall,” Farrell concludes.
Writing a thesis about the developing world teaches students about a drastically different place than the one in which we live now, while they produce their own sliver of history. As Mabruk says “Professor [Caroline] Elkins [his thesis advisor] has instilled in me the importance of, getting out of the ivory tower—that is, of deploying knowledge and analysis gained in the classroom to confront real-world challenges in an insightful, well-informed way.” For him, “This credo started with my thesis, and will no doubt animate my professional life.” It should go without saying that before trying to impact underprivileged societies hundreds of miles away we should make the utmost effort to understand those cultures, and a senior thesis on a developing country is one of the most thoughtful, thorough ways to do this.

Thirty minutes west of Boston, the Natick school district system has announced a $2.27 million plan to equip all of its students from eighth-grade and up with laptops—every single one of them a Mac. The district’s administration clearly believes that equipping every teenager with a new laptop in class is the best way to prepare them for the challenges of the digital age. Superintendent Peter Sanchioni, one of the backers of the project, told Natick’s School Committee, in a statement printed in the Boston Globe, that “we need to change our view of the mind from classic education.” Others agreed, including the chairman of the School Committee, David Margil, who expected the hardware handout to produce “measurable improvements in student performance” and give Natick’s young people a leg up in the “workforce after they graduate.”
Natick’s decision is by no means an isolated one in America, as more and more people realize that technology must be embraced head-on and early-on to meet the realities of the twenty-first century and keep education competitive. Its approach, of handing every student a laptop as though it were a textbook, to be used in class and handed back eventually, is an extension of other proposals. Natick plans not just to make students technology-literate, but as Sanchioni, indicated, to revolutionize and transform the classroom experience.
The internet is noticeably changing how we gather and learn information, and high school students should be encouraged not to see digital technology as relegated to the spheres of social networking and entertainment. The ability to comb through useless and distracting information on the internet in order to find something worthwhile requires a different training that has largely been left to individuals in our generation of college students. By bringing technology intensively into the classroom, teachers and officials can help students learn better and faster from the web. Yet the scale of Natick’s move—not to mention the expense—begs the question of whether or not middle-aged (or older) local planners have responded with characteristic excess to the digital age. Although the internet has changed a lot about how we live, a move to spend millions of dollars in one small school system to launch a laptop invasion exhibits precisely the dangers in falsely assuming that digitization has radically changed the world, even down to how we think.
The debate over how educators should respond to the continuously evolving ways in which information and material is accessible is both complicated and heavily-examined. It is widely recognized that research skills must be adapted and fine-tuned to the specific challenges of finding information for an academic paper that would, only a decade go, have been done completely within the physical confines of a library. The distractions of the internet’s limitless trove of websites present exactly the limits to doing meaningful, concentrated work centered around a Google search. Students should be taught early on to navigate around the roadblocks of the internet, but having a laptop open in every high-school course may overshoot this goal, harming the immediacy of the class experience. If we accept that the internet has changed not so much how we think or fundamentally process data, but rather demands a new set of skills, then it would seem apparent that a good education must consist of a more balanced focus on technology.
Secondary education stands a better chance of leaving teenagers well educated if laptops are combined with books and physical writing. Schools can perhaps make a more meaningful difference to Information Technology skills by devoting more attention to the separate classes that already exist for this discipline, while keeping some classes laptops free. By balancing the old and new methods of teaching and learning information, students can be made both more computer literate and left free of distraction and the manufactured imposition of the internet at every stage of a high-school career.
There is of course another side to this story revealed by this laptop initiative. By choosing to spend such a large sum on one laptop for every student, Natick says a lot about the vast inequities in our school system. Thirty minutes away, in Dorchester and other low-income areas of Boston, many schools struggle to purchase up-to date textbooks. Distributing personal laptops so that every student can emerge suitably competitive for the professional world would not be not merely out of the question, but more likely a risible proposal. This kind of reality shows, to some extent, that our own debate on technology diverges from the one that affects many, less wealthy school systems. Since the Massachusetts state government is not involved in local politics and decisions on property-tax expenditure, it is always the case that some districts will provide their public schools with significantly more resources than others. Even so, it is worth considering at a purely conceptual level how much better spend this $2.27 million might have on introducing broad technology and IT training across a wide cross-section of public schools.
The challenges of the internet mean students must be introduced early on to methods of doing serious academic and professional work in this format. In an effort to meet the demands of a digital age whose revolutionary effect has been frequently exaggerated, one district has chosen mistakenly to spend money that could have been better spent elsewhere.

University Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 has agreed to work closely on a variety of legal issues with law firm Massey & Gail and its clients.
Back at the Law School after a nine month stint in the Obama administration, Tribe is planning to teach a seminar at the Law School in the fall.
At Massey & Gail, he is offering his legal services—litigation, counseling, and strategic advice—both for pay and pro bono.
Despite frustrations with budgetary constraints and the limited authority in his position at the Justice Department, Tribe said he now looks favorably upon his time spent serving the administration.
“I learned a great deal and got started a number of good programs that I hope will continue into the future,” Tribe said.
Tribe has not accepted any formal position with the firm Massey & Gail, as doing so would violate Harvard’s rules regarding professors and outside affiliations.
It is the Law School’s policy to restrict faculty members’ involvement in outside projects to an average of one day a week in order to keep faculty members focused on their responsibilities within the University.
“Harvard wisely limits attachments to other institutions,” Tribe said. “More outside links means that, apart from draining hours, one’s soul might migrate away from academics.”
Many Law School professors also pursue a broad range of activities outside of being faculty members, serving on various boards and legal committees that then inform their roles at the Law School.
Providing outside legal services, Tribe said, introduces him to ideas that feed into how he sees the law and formulates his legal thinking.
“It shapes what I teach,” Tribe said.
Tribe has argued dozens of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, has helped to draft the constitutions of South Africa, the Czech Republic, and the Marshall Islands, and has been described by the New York Times as “arguably the most famous constitutional scholar and Supreme Court practitioner in the country.”
“We’re thrilled to be working with him,” said Massey & Gail founding partner Jonathan S. Massey ’85.
Massey, who has worked on and off with Tribe for 25 years, said he is delighted by the chance to work with him again and benefit from the skills that Tribe brings to the table.
“Law is really about thinking creatively to solve problems,” Massey said. “And Larry does this better than anyone.”

Richard J. Lazarus, a Supreme Court practitioner and a leading scholar on environmental law, has been appointed as Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.
Lazarus is not a stranger to the Law School. In addition to being a former student, he’s guest taught for full semesters in the past.
Elizabeth B. Forsyth, a third year at the Law School and a managing editor of the Environmental Law Review, took a course on environmental theory, law, and applications taught by Lazarus during January Term her second year. Lazarus was a visiting professor at the time.
“[The appointment] is a coup for the Environmental Law Program,” Forsyth said, explaining that the addition of Lazarus will really strengthen the program.
“It’s Harvard—you can never have too many great professors,” Forsyth added.
Jody Freeman, a professor at the Law School and the faculty director of the Environmental Law Program, said that she was very excited about the appointment. Explaining Lazarus’ extensive experience in the field of environmental law, she pointed to his exceptional job heading up President Obama’s National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling.
She called Lazarus the lawyer in the country with the most extensive knowledge of environmental law cases, and said that Lazarus’ first-hand experience in practice would strengthen the already strong program.
Despite his celebrity status in the environmental law community, Forsyth said that Lazarus is committed to reaching out to his students.
“The unique thing about Professor Lazarus is that he’s very open to mentoring his students,” Forsyth said, adding that Lazarus made himself much more available than other professors at the Law School, even hosting several dinners during the course of the three-week term. “He’s gregarious, he’s outgoing, he’s warm personally, and he’s funny—his course evaluations were the highest I’ve ever seen.”
Forsyth was one of 58 students who signed a letter to Lazarus urging him to come to the Law School. Forsyth said that the outpouring of student support is a testament to Lazarus’ popularity.
“Those of us who have had you as a professor know you as an excellent teacher, scholar, and mentor who would make a terrific addition to the Harvard faculty. Those of us who have not had the chance to take your classes are eager for the chance,” the letter read. “We know that the decision to come will be based on many factors, student support being perhaps only a small part. But, on the chance it makes a difference in your decision, we want you to come.”

Professor William N. Lipscomb Jr., a Nobel Laureate in chemistry who taught at Harvard for over 50 years, has passed away at the age 91, due to complications from a fall and pneumonia.
Lipscomb was known as many things: family man, mentor, tennis enthusiast, teacher, and jokester—but above all he will be remembered as a scientist.
In the course of his half-century-long research career, Lipscomb worked in rocketry for the War Department during World War II, made discoveries about glucose production that have helped in the treatment of diabetes, and studied the structure of boron-hydrogen compounds known as “boranes.”
Lipscomb won the 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the borane research.
Lipscomb’s passion for science was evident at an early age. According to an obituary in the Boston Globe, Lipscomb had such an inquisitive scientific mind that he was permitted to work independently on his own experiments in his high school chemistry class.
“Like everybody else, he got older,” said Chemistry Professor Richard H. Holm, a colleague and teaching partner of Lipscomb. “Yet his passion for understanding things and his passion for chemical science never abated ... He was a real scientist. He was interested in questions and answers, and I thought he was inspiring.”
Early in his career, Lipscomb pursued multiple passions, attending the University of Kentucky on a musical scholarship for the clarinet.
But under the eye of mentor Linus Pauling—himself a Nobel Prize winner—Lipscomb began to focus on chemistry.
In turn, Lipscomb later served as a mentor for many young scientists, and three chemistry Nobel Laureates ultimately emerged from his classes and labs: Roald Hoffmann, Thomas A. Steitz, and Ada Yonath.
Lipscomb served a Professor Emeritus at Harvard for more than two decades. He leaves behind his wife, three children, three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
Through his students, his family, and his discoveries, Lipscomb’s legacy will continue to positively impact his scientific field—and the community at large—for many years to come, professors said.
“Bill was a treasure, both to our department, and to the world,” fellow Harvard Chemistry Professor David R. Liu said. “He was not only a model scientist who revolutionized his field ... but also a warm and humorous colleague who remained eager to contribute to our community over many decades. He will be missed.”

Panelists discussing drug violence along the U.S.-Mexico border said that the corruption of government officials on both sides of the border is a major problem facing the fight against cartels, during a forum at the Institute of Politics yesterday.
“[Cartels] corrupt to create permissive environments in which they can operate and get away with anything from murder to mass murder,” said Michael Braun, the former chief of operations at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. “They corrupt, they intimidate and they resort to extreme violence when the other two don’t work.”
However, Braun did not attribute the corruption only to officials on the Mexican side of the border as he said that over eighty border patrol officers have been arrested in the U.S. on corruption charges.
Braun said that cartels control networks that are significantly larger than mafia operations in the U.S. because Mexican cartels function through global networks and do not limit their activities to only one region.
Braun called the current violence in Mexico a “turf war” between rival cartels. To put the violence in perspective, Angela Kocherga, a journalist based in Mexico, noted that more people were killed in Juarez, Mexico than were killed in Afghanistan last year. Kocherga described Juarez as “ground zero” in the drug war that is currently raging.
Kocherga explained that control of the drug trade in specific areas fuels violence between cartels as they vie for dominance of the lucrative transportation corridors into the US.
Although Alejandro Poiré Romero, the technical secretary of the National Security Council of Mexico, said that the vast majority of the violence is inflicted against those involved with the cartels, rather than bystanders, Kocherga said that those only very tangentially involved are still affected.
“You also see entire families being wiped out because someone on the periphery might be involved,” she said.
To combat the violence, Pioré said that the current administration in Mexico is taking an aggressive approach to coordinating federal and local efforts. He also said that to fix the “rupturing of social fabric” in Mexico, the government is beginning a series of broad social programs to address issues such as poverty, health care, and education, so that Mexicans feel that there are options available to them besides being involved with the cartels.
Luciana E. Milano ‘14, a member of the IOP Forum Committee, said that she thought the event was an important one to bring to campus in order to make people aware of the oft-forgotten situation close to our border.
“At Harvard, you hear people talk about Libya and Japan, but to me what’s happening in Mexico is just as pressing a concern,” she said.
Students disagreed about whether the strategies put forth by the panelists would be successful. While some said that the approach of integrating local and federal reform would be effective, Milano said that she was concerned that the discourse put forth will not match up with the reality of the situation.
“Both sides recognize the problem and they address in a theoretical way, but they don’t necessarily see the pragmatic side,” Milano said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The extravagant Regatta Bar in the Charles Hotel buzzed with the conversations of Harvard community members, united to honor the recipients and nominees of the 14th annual Harvard College Leadership Awards yesterday.
Madeleine E. Ballard ’11, a director of the Peer Health Exchange and Radcliffe rugby player, was honored as the award recipient. An honorable mention was presented to Emily K. Harburg ’11, a former co-vice president in the Leadership Institute at Harvard College and a former member of the varsity women’s volleyball team.
“These women have both amassed amazing portfolios of leadership,” said Susan B. Marine, Women’s Center director and assistant dean of student life at the College. “They bring leadership down to earth with their infectious kindness, and they are a tremendous force for change in this community.”
Ballard said she considers her greatest leadership contribution as a “close tie between the peer health exchange and the women’s rugby team,” which she said she regards as her second family. She accepted the award, adding, “I don’t think that I need recognition, but it’s a blessing.”
The Women’s Leadership Award was the brainchild of Terrie Fried Bloom ’75, who sought to amplify visibility of women leaders at Harvard College. She said former Harvard College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 helped her develop the idea to honor student-leaders who have empowered and inspired women to assume leadership roles.
“There were bad feelings between Harvard and Radcliffe, and this award was a way to give an olive branch,” said Bloom, who funded the award through an endowment established with a gift.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds also acknowledged scholar-athletes Ballard and Harburg for their “distinguished commitment to public service and political action.”
“Their personal integrity and selfless leadership is what the College is committed to instilling in its students. They inspire us to make positive contributions in the world,” Hammonds said.
“We still have a society where questions are raised about women’s capacity to lead,” she said. “This was seen when Faust stepped up to be president of the University. It was seen as unexpected, but I am confident she will not be our last woman president.”
After the students were honored, Christina “Tina” M. Tchen ’78, assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama, was named the recipient of the Women’s Professional Leadership Award. This award, given to a Radcliffe College or Harvard College alumnus, acknowledged Tchen for her achievements in public service.
She was recognized for her work as former director of the Office of Public Engagement and current executive director of the White House Council on Women and Girls.
“I’ve always been passionately concerned and active in women’s issues,” Tchen said. “My coming of age in the ’70s, the fight for the Equal Rights Amendment, serving in a profession as a corporate trial attorney, and looking at my daughter have all motivated me to be active.”
Ballard said that she hopes people leave the event with a new definition of leadership.
“Leadership is most often understated. It’s happening all around us,” Ballard said. “We may see the soldier win the Purple Heart or the star athlete whose performance leads a team to a championship, but we are all being watched and have our own spheres of influence. If we live our lives with purpose, that will be remembered long after the spotlight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Community members voiced opposition to granting a license to a local McDonald’s in order to extend its hours to 2 a.m. at last night’s Allston Civic Association meeting.
Allston residents at the meeting said they worried that granting the restaurant later hours might disturb the largely residential neighborhood by attracting students and others out late at night.
The conditional license would require the fast food restaurant—located in the Brighton Mills Shopping Center—to renew the agreement every year. The change was presented as temporary, but residents said they thought that what was marketed as a temporary policy might easily become a permanent one.
“They put it on temporarily but then they never take it off,” Task Force member Rita DiGesse said. “I’m dead set against late hours because it’s a neighborhood—you are close to homes all along Western Ave.”
Bob King, the owner of the McDonald’s, said he has had good experiences with late-night establishments. King operates fourteen stores throughout the Boston area, two of which run 24-hours a day. King asked ACA members to extend the store’s hours from midnight to 2 a.m and said that he thought that the change in hours would ultimately have a minimal impact.
“I really do believe we will be a good neighbor,” King said. “We proved our way, we went for a late closing and had no major issues and the stores worked very well.”
King said the main reason he wanted to extend hours was to regain losses that the relocation of The Charlesview Apartments—a low-income housing unit—would cause. The new housing complex, slated to begin construction in upcoming months, will be located a few blocks down Western Avenue on land that is currently occupied by several vacant buildings in the Brighton Mills Shopping Center.
As a result, King explained, he wanted to discuss the issue with the future residents of the new apartments, none of which were present at last night’s meeting.
In a preliminary vote, six members voted for the extension and seven opposed.
Allston Task Force member Brent Whelan ’73 said that extending the McDonald’s hours could result in negative consequences for the neighborhood, such as encouraging other outlets in the area to become late-night establishments.
President of the ACA Paul Berkeley, who opposed the later hours, said that the probability of Allston residents actually using the late-hour operations is low.
“There are largely commercial areas that have a large night-population,” Berkeley said. “But Western Ave. is somewhat of a different population.”
Harvard’s Director of Community Relations for Boston Kevin A. McCluskey ’76 said that Harvard has specified preferred hours of operations in their most recent leases to restaurants to ease residents’ concerns.
McCluskey said that he opposed the extended hours because “we want to be very mindful of the quality of this residential neighborhood.”

Popping bottles of diet soda—instead of regular soda—is a better bet if you hope to avoid type 2 diabetes, according to a study recently published by a group of researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“Drinking regular soda and other sugary drinks increases a person’s risk of diabetes, but not artificially sweetened soft drinks, coffee, or tea,” said Lawrence de Koning, a postdoctoral fellow at HSPH who served as a data analyst for the study.
The research, which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, examined the relationship between regular and diet beverages as a risk factor for diabetes by looking at the medical status and dietary habits of more than 40,000 healthy men.
For the duration of the study, which lasted from 1986 to 2000, researchers observed the participants’ average weekly intake of sugar and artificially sweetened beverages.
The findings showed that men who drank one daily serving of sugar-sweetened beverages, which include sodas, fruit punches, and lemonades, were 16 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than men who did not drink sugary beverages.
Diet soda, on the other hand, was not associated with elevated risk for diabetes.
Prior studies have suggested that the consumption of diet soda may increase an individual’s risk for diabetes, but de Koning said the link was probably due to other factors that diet soda drinkers and diabetics have in common, such as obesity, poor diet, and high cholesterol.
The study also showed that replacing one serving of sugar-sweetened beverage with a cup of coffee each day reduces the risk for diabetes by 17 percent.
Though diet sodas appeared to be a safer alternative to regular sodas, de Koning said there are other healthier options than artificially sweetened drinks to quench your thirst.
“The cheapest alternative is certainly water, which is not associated with any major risk, while coffee is quite beneficial since it is inversely related to diabetes,” he said.
However, de Koning cautioned that, even though the evidence is not strong, drinking excessive amount of diet sodas may lead to kidney abnormality, electrolyte disturbance, and increase in preterm birth among pregnant women.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of the University await Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’s financial update for the school due early next month, many faculty members say they hope next year’s budget will address the needs of growing departments, several of which say they have been short-staffed in recent years.
Following Smith’s Dec. 2008 meeting in which he announced a hold on the majority of searches—in addition to freezing annual salary increases—many concentrations that have since seen increases in the number of concentrators   say they find themselves with a shortage in faculty and a lack of resources to balance the sudden increase.
“We’re all understaffed. We all could use more,” Visual and Environmental Science Professor Tom C. Conley said.
The paucity of funding has left some professors concerned about the criteria used by FAS administrators when deciding how to allocate resources.
According to the number of respondents in the Senior Exit Surveys from the Class of 2010, VES has seen an increase of 56 percent in concentrators over the past eight years—the largest percent increase of any concentration with more than 25 students. But VES and Sociology—which has seen an increase in concentrators of 41 percent over the past eight years according to survey numbers—have seen little to no increase in their number of faculty over the past few years.
According to Conley, a faculty search launched two years ago fell through after the two final candidates chose to go elsewhere. The department is currently looking for an assistant professor in film history, an appointment that will bring the number of professors in the department to 13.
According to Conley, many Harvard departments tend be small but composed of top-notch faculty members, which the administration frequently takes advantage of, knowing that what Conley calls “Type A” people are likely to work very hard.
Smith said that as FAS emerges from an era of fiscal belt-tightening, the school is looking to reallocate resources effectively.
“Departments’ needs and aspirations determine how new authorizations are determined and how visiting faculty and lecturers are allocated,” Smith said in an interview last week.
Smith said that faculty searches are being authorized on a case by case basis, but the school still is not in “growth mode.”
While “working to support the teaching and research needs of departments,” Smith said, “we still have a structural deficit, and there are limited funds, so we can’t do everything we would prefer to do. We must be strategic in how we authorize new resources.”
Still, some faculty members wonder whether this evaluation process is addressing the needs of growing departments that face a shortage in faculty.
“By all the measures which FAS uses, we’ve come out on top—we’ve achieved them and done more,” Sociology Professor Orlando Patterson said earlier this month. “But they [the administration] do nothing in terms of trying to meet the problems we face.”
“In a way, we’ve become victims of our success,” Patterson added.
After the endowment dropped by nearly 30 percent from its historic high of $36.9 billion, funds from the endowment to pay for the FAS budget decreased significantly, resulting in a $220 million deficit.
Since 2008, Smith has pared down the deficit. In September, he announced the standing deficit rested at $35 million, and he has consistently repeated a promise he made in 2008 to balance the budget by the end of the 2012 fiscal year.

Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture and the Graduate School of Design are developing a new undergraduate concentration in architectural studies planned to be offered for the first time in the fall of 2012.
The proposal, which was presented to HAA faculty Wednesday morning, covers areas such as the theory of architecture, studio work, and architectural history across a variety of cultures and time periods.
The program’s developers said its strength lies in the interaction between a graduate school and an undergraduate department, as much of the concentration will be built around current HAA and GSD offerings. The planners of the concentration said the collaboration would be a unique and innovative offering for undergraduates at Harvard.
“There’s genuine excitement both in the GSD and in HAA to do this. This is really a pilot program in terms of this kind of collaboration as far as I know,” said HAA Department Chair Thomas B.F. Cummins, who has been developing the program with a small committee of faculty from HAA and the GSD since last year. “I think it will be good for Harvard College [in the sense of] the cross-fertilization. It will offer something that hasn’t been accessible to undergraduates before.”
Cummins added that he believes that the success of the architectural studies concentration could open the door for more collaboration between graduate schools and the College.
While architecture programs at many peer institutions are pre-professional in nature, Harvard’s proposed concentration would remain in step with the College’s other concentration offerings.
“It will be embedded in a liberal arts education,” Cummins said. “It’s to understand ... the role of architecture in a larger contextualized sense.”
K. Michael Hays, professor of architectural theory at the GSD, noted that the courses within the new concentration would enhance students’ intellectual abilities in the same way as other liberal arts concentrations do.
“We believe that while writing will always be [essential], thinking through making can supplement thinking through writing,” Hays said.
For example, one potential studio course would allow students to explore “the relationship of image and text” by having students design the setting of something found in literature based on their reading and interpretation, he said.
“It’s not just about learning the techniques. It’s learning how to actually use those technical and design techniques to think through problems,” Cummins said.
The concentration would also involve a diverse range of architecture, both geographically and historically.
“Between the two departments, we cover Africa, Islam, and Southeast Asia,” Hays said. “It’s important that [the program] has a global reach and that it goes from ancient to contemporary.”
While both Cummins and Hays adamantly stated that the prospective program will not be pre-professional in nature, Cummins said the opportunities that would be available to those who pursue the new concentration would nonetheless enhance their abilities to pursue architecture as a professional pursuit.
“It will allow students who want to go into professional schools [to] have a leg up with this,” he said. “The difference is that it’s not structured to have architects in training. You can certainly get a portfolio ready to present to go into graduate school.”
Cummins said he did not anticipate the concentration would be a large one, estimating that approximately 12 students per year would choose to concentrate in it.
University President Drew G. Faust expressed her enthusiasm at the possibility of such a program in a question and answer period for admitted students on Saturday.
“I hope it won’t be long before we’ve established an undergraduate architecture program,” she said in reference to the potential concentration.
The program has not yet garnered administrative approval from the HAA faculty and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Clare M. Gillis, Harvard graduate and freelance reporter who was captured in Libya two weeks ago, may be allowed to call home this week.
According to a Medill News Service article on Tuesday, the Libyan government has alerted the U.S. State Department to expect a phone call from Gillis and James Foley, a freelancer who was captured with Gillis. The information was communicated to Foley’s mother, who welcomed it as an encouraging sign and a confirmation that Foley and Gillis are currently held by the Libyan government.
It is uncertain whether Gillis’ family has been directly informed of the possible phone call and when exactly it will happen. But friends of Gillis said they were heartened by the news and hope that it might be one step closer toward securing her release.
“One advantage for her calling home would be ... that she would know that there have been people working for her, hundreds of people, who care and are deeply concerned, and don’t sleep at night,” said Alexander More, a history teaching fellow at Harvard who has known Gillis for six years.
Today marks the 17th day since Gillis’ capture on April 5. Friends and family members of Gillis have been anxiously awaiting her release, though little information has come out of Libya regarding Gillis’ whereabouts.
“We are very worried, literally. We are very concerned about this because we just don’t know anything about it right now,” said Robert Gillis, her father.
Prior to the news about the phone call, the only confirmation of the Libyan government’s holding of Gillis came from a released Al Jazeera journalist, who was reported to have seen Gillis at a government detention center in Tripoli in good shape but with a black eye.
“Every time we eat, every time we take a shower, at least the closest friends think, well, has Clare been able to take a shower, has Clare been able to have a hot meal lately?” More said.
Efforts have been taken by various parties, including Harvard University, the State Department, and nongovernmental organizations, to expedite the release of Gillis and other captured journalists.
“We are closely following the news regarding Dr. Gillis. Harvard officials have been in direct contact with the State Department to register our concern about her detention, and we support the US government’s call for her release,” Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin wrote in an email to The Crimson.
In a press release on April 15, the Human Rights Watch demanded the immediate release of the captured journalists, condemning the detention as “unlawful restrictions by the government.”
An online petition pressuring for the journalists’ release was created, with the goal originally set for 5,000 signatures but recently upgraded to 10,000. As of last night, the number of signatures reached 4,920.
Friends and family of Gillis have been working hard to increase awareness of the issue through press contacts and online information sharing. Clare Gillis’ parents were interviewed by the BBC today about their daughter and will be appearing on this morning’s Today Show, according to a post on the Facebook page Friends for the Release of Clare Gillis.
The State Department continues to work with the Turkish government and NGOs on the issue, though the lack of a strong U.S. diplomatic presence in Libya and protracted violence may complicate negotiations.
“The State Department is very careful about what they share, justly so, and so are members of government and members of Congress, because it is sensitive information and requires painstaking efforts and risks on our own personnel here,” said More, who has been in frequent contact with Senator John Kerry’s office. “We have to be very careful about the situation because we don’t want to make it worse. We don’t want this woman to be held for weeks or months, that can’t happen.”

Juniors will find out next week whether they will receive a portion of the $19,000 planned to be disbursed for senior thesis research through the Peretz fund, which faced controversy in the fall due to statements made by its namesake.
The Peretz fund was established by former students of Martin “Marty” H. Peretz, who was a head tutor in Social Studies. The fund’s donor list includes current University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann ’71 and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore ’69. It reached a final total of $650,000, after a week of intense media scrutiny in late September brought in about $150,000 for the fund.
The fund faced opposition in the wake of statements made by Peretz in a blog post in which he wrote that “Muslim life is cheap.”
In an email to Harvard College Research Program applicants, Director of Studies Anya Bernstein said that the names of the recipients would remain anonymous and students would be able to write that they won Harvard College Research Program awards instead of explicitly stating they did research under the Peretz fund.
This arrangement did not surprise Social Studies concentrators.
“I think the unusualness of the rules reflect the unusualness of the history of the fund,” Social Studies concentrator Fahim Zaman ’12 said.
After his statements in the blog, Peretz faced widespread condemnation. Originally slated to be the keynote speaker for Harvard’s 50th Anniversary
Celebration for Social Studies last September, Peretz was removed from the speaker’s list, giving a short address at the main luncheon.
At the luncheon, first Head Tutor of Social Studies Robert P. Wolff ’54 derided the committee for accepting the donation.
“I had always hoped that Social Studies would hold itself to a higher standard ... but, here, the money stinks,” he said at the time of the donation.
Protesters followed Peretz around throughout the anniversary celebration, holding up signs that quoted Peretz’s controversial comments. During question-and-answer sessions, several audience members criticized the ethics of the fund in questions to the panelists.
Social Studies concentrators interviewed for this article expressed hesitation toward applying for the grant, saying that they could understand the confidentiality terms.
“I don’t object to the anonymity in this circumstance,” Social Studies concentrator Eleanor E. Martin ’12 said. “Obviously, the Peretz fund has caused a lot of controversy, but they’re going to give it to all things that Marty opposed.”
Zaman personally took greater issue with the fund.
“I am a Muslim, and I am sympathetic to the Palestinian cause,” he said. “And I personally think that a lot of people would look down on whomever did get money from that fund and whatever research they did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Victory is sweet—but retribution makes it even sweeter.
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (8-4, 4-1 Ivy) snapped a six-game losing streak to Boston University (6-8, 2-2 America East) that dated back to 1994, beating its crosstown rival, 16-6, last night at Nickerson Field.
The Crimson came ready to attack from the beginning. After only 30 seconds of play, junior attacker Jess Halpern fired a shot at the Terriers’ goal, but the ball hit the post, and the score remained 0-0. Just over two and a half minutes later, sophomore midfielder Danielle Tetreault tallied the first goal of the game off a free-position shot. Tetreault came back around soon after to score yet again, making the score 2-0.
Harvard’s next two goals were a back-to-back effort. After Halpern recorded her first score of the game, sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen notched her first goal of the night only 15 seconds later. The two quick tallies put the Crimson ahead, 4-0.
A few minutes after that, VanderMeulen beat out two Boston University players for the ball in front of the Terriers’ goal. She dished to Tetreault, who charged to the cage and scored.
“I think that we came out very hard,” VanderMeulen said. “We were excited. [Boston University] is a hometown rival, and we wanted to establish some bragging rights.”
The Terriers finally responded to Harvard’s five-goal streak in the 16th minute. After her team won the draw control, junior attacker Hannah Frey slipped a goal past the Crimson goalie, pushing the score to 5-1. But Harvard was not about to let the Terriers make a comeback.
The game’s next goal came from Crimson junior co-captain Melanie Baskind. Coming off of a transition from a blocked shot by Harvard, Baskind received the ball inside the crease, maneuvered her way around multiple Boston University defenders, and shot the ball only a few feet from the goal. Baskind’s score made the game 6-1.
Halpern struck next. After getting the ball behind the goal, she looped around the side of the pole and rocketed a shot to the upper-right hand corner of the net.
Freshman attacker Chelsey Newman scored the next Crimson point in a similar fashion, tallying her eighth goal of the season and Harvard’s eighth goal of the contest.
The Terriers had the next chance to score after a free-position attempt was allotted to Boston University’s Frey, who was fouled going to goal. But the shot from Frey hit the post, and Harvard picked up the ground ball. On the same possession, Halpern scored her second goal of the game, making the score 9-1.
Right after Halpern’s tally, a won draw control and a speedy goal from the Terriers brought the home team within seven.
Boston University found itself in front of the Crimson goal a few minutes later after a forced turnover. The ball was bobbled in midair until Terriers senior midfielder Rachel Collins found a way to hit the ball into the goal, closing the score gap to six.
Harvard responded again. Tetreault passed the ball to VanderMeulen, who threaded the Boston University defense with a tricky underhanded shot. VanderMeulen’s goal made the score 10-3 as the two teams traveled to their respective benches for halftime.
“I think one thing that we wanted to focus on was not letting up because we tend to do that when we have leads,” VanderMeulen said. “So going into halftime, we didn’t want to relax. We needed to start the half like a new game and keep pounding.”
The Crimson did exactly what it set out to do at first. Less than three minutes into the second half, junior midfielder Tyler Petropulos pulled a spin move on a Terrier defender and scored.
Yet Boston University was unfazed and made one last push to cut into Harvard’s lead. After many fouls and back-and-forth play, the Terriers scored the next two goals in only two shots.
Boston University’s next shot came from freshman attacker Elizabeth Morse who ran down the middle and snapped one towards the goal, low and right. But junior goalie Kerry Clark came up with a save that kept the score 10-5.
Five minutes later the Terriers came up with another score, but their sixth goal ended up being their last score of the game.
“I’d say that a big thing on defense is that we were really able to stop their feeds, especially in the first half,” Clark said. “They’re a big feeding team, and we were able to stop their feeders from getting the ball.”
Besides keeping its opponent out of the net, the Crimson also finished the game on an offensive high note, scoring five straight to end the match.
“I think this game showed that when we play 60 minutes, we can take teams down,” VanderMeulen said. “I think that’s important going into our next two games and the Ivy tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The match may not have been as epic as the 2008 Wimbledon final between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, but the season finale for the Harvard men’s tennis team could not have been any closer.
Yesterday, the Crimson (15-10, 4-3 Ivy) traveled to Hanover, N.H. to face off against the Big Green (13-7, 4-3) at Dartmouth’s Alexis Boss Tennis Center.
The match came down to the wire, but Harvard ended up edging out the victory, 4-3. The win allowed the Crimson to continue its dominance in the all-time series over the Big Green, which Harvard leads, 67-7.
“Another close 4-3 match,” Harvard coach Andrew Rueb said. “The Ivy League this year has been extremely competitive and tight. Everyone knew it was going to be 4-3 before the match started…It’s all about the little things you can do to stay positive in a tough match or turn a match around when you’re down a set. That’s really what defines this Ivy League season.”
“It’s always good to end on a win,” junior Jon Pearlman continued. “It was good to come through on this one. There have been a lot of tight matches and we lost a couple that could have gone either way in the beginning of the season.”
Coming into the matchup, Dartmouth had played in five straight one-point matches. The Big Green lost the first two of these duals, but then responded with three consecutive wins.
On the other hand, the Crimson was coming off a close 4-3 loss to Brown.
If history were any indication, though, Harvard would dominate the matchup. In the previous 74 meetings between the two teams, the Crimson has won 67 of the matches, including 19 straight since 1994.
“Harvard men’s tennis has only lost to Dartmouth seven times in its history,” junior Ali Felton said. “So it would have been somewhat humiliating to be part of the teams that lost, [although the Big Green is] pretty good this year.”
The Crimson started out the matchup by losing all three of its doubles matches to give the Dartmouth the early 1-0 advantage.
But Harvard responded in singles, picking up four individual wins. Pearlman won his first set 6-2 and wasted little time in the second set, bageling his opponent, 6-0, and tying the score in the overall match, 1-1.
“I played a lot of long points and tried to be aggressive when I could,” Pearlman said. “My opponent was inconsistent and I capitalized on that and just tried to play back as many balls as possible.”
Sophomores Andy Nguyen and Josh Tchan both won their respective matches in three sets.
Captain Aba Omodele-Lucien lost his match and freshman Casey MacMaster followed with another loss in the third set, 6-4, after splitting the opening two.
With the score tied at three games apiece, Harvard’s chance at ending the regular season with a victory rested on Felton’s shoulders.
Felton and his opponent split the first two sets, as the junior took the first, 7-6, but then lost the second set by the same score.
With both teams gathered around to watch the final set, Felton prevailed in the third set, 6-4, giving Harvard the win.
“It was very close and very, very long,” Felton said. “I got ahead [in the first set] and there were a lot of ties and he pegged me back [in the second set]. I never lost my head. I just kept to my game plan and just managed to win in the end. [I] really fought for every single ball.”
While the Crimson will not advance to the postseason, the squad finished the season on a high note.
“It is very nice to end with a very good team effort with a win,” Rueb said. “Everybody contributed and it’s a good way to finish off our 2011 season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team stormed back in the third period to take a lead that it would not relinquish as it earned a win over Brown, 16-12.
The Crimson (16-13, 2-2 Collegiate Water Polo Association) beat the Bears (10-15, 1-3), at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass on Wednesday.
“I thought we played really well,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I definitely was concerned coming in because it was the third time we played them this season. It was the only home game they had this year, and it was senior night for them. We had a big hill to climb on this one so it was a big game for us. It’s Brown and that’s a big rivalry game for us. It was a fun game.”
The Crimson won all three of its matches against Brown this season, handily beating the Bears, 15-5, on Feb 23 and 9-5 at the ECAC Championship on Feb 26.
Emotions ran high for Brown which showed in its inspired first quarter play.
“I think they just gave out ready came out really ready to play,” Aisha Price said. “It was their senior night and there only home game so they had a lot of fans and they brought a lot of that energy into the pool.”
The Bears typically struggle in the first quarter, having been outscored 80-53 in over the course of the season.
But that changed as Brown leading soccer freshman Kate Woods scored the first goal of the game at the 4:58 mark in first.
Crimson junior Lizzie Abbott would even the score with twenty seconds later.
Both teams then traded goals, making the score 2-2 with 2:41 left in the quarter.
The Bears went on a three goal run lead by sophomores Brittany Westerman and Katharine Booher who scored two and one goal respectively.
The run put Brown up, 5-2, with 13 seconds left in the quarter.
A quick Harvard strike cut the lead to 5-3 at the end of the quarter.
In the second quarter the Crimson stepped up their defense and shut out the Bears in the beginning of the period while scoring two goals, tying the score at five.
Brown finally broke through at the 2:23 mark when Booher scored one of her five goals of the game.
The teams proceeded to trade goals once again, making the score 7-6.
A late steal by Bears freshman Sarah Presant lead to a score with seven seconds remaining in the half an gave Brown the momentum ended into halftime.
To open the second half Brown extended the lead off another Booher goal giving the Bears a 9-6.
Harvard responded in a big way by charging back with seven unanswered goals to turn a three goal deficit into a four goal lead.
The streak was lead by the scoring of Crimson duo sophomore Aisha Price and junior Monica Zdrojewski.
“I think Monica played really well and she brought a lot of energy out and put a lot of goals away that we needed to go,” A. Price said. “She had a couple of breakaways that she finished that were huge and gave us momentum.”
Price equally stepped up in the run.
“[A. Price] had a nice run in the third quarter where in a minute and a half or two minutes she scored three goals,” Minnis said. “I think she had a huge game.”
Brown tried to come back in the fourth by scoring the first two goals of the period but three connective Harvard goals pushed the lead to 16-11, a lead from which the Bears could not recover.
“I think for us is once we get the ball rolling in terms of putting points on the board we can just kinda take off.” freshman Shayna Price said.
Booher netted her fifth goal of the game with 1:11 remaining to push the final score to 16-12.
“I thought it was a good win,” A. Price said. “Brown came out with a lot of energy and put up a fight at the beginning of the game. They controlled the game and we were down, but later in the game we were able to switch that momentum and use it to our advantage. We took over the flow of the game and were able to execute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 8 1/2 innings of play in the first round of the baseball Beanpot yesterday afternoon, the Crimson men’s baseball team (7-29, 3-9 Ivy) and its opponent, University of Massachusetts (12-18, 5-4 Atlantic 10), were stuck in a 0-0 stalemate.
But with one out in the bottom of the ninth, Harvard sophomore first baseman Danny Moskovits singled up the middle to send home freshman outfielder Jack Colton, as the walkoff RBI lifted the Crimson to a dramatic 1-0 victory over the Minutemen at Northeastern.
“This win definitely gave us some good momentum,” Moskovits said. “We’ve been struggling a bit this year and have lost some really close games...It’s awesome to have a close game go our way.”
Colton—who earned Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors after an impressive performance in the team’s series against Brown—got on base with a walk to start the final inning of play, capitalizing on UMass starting pitcher Charlie Benson’s tired arm.
“Going into my last at-bat, I knew [Benson] was tiring and starting to have some control problems,” Colton said. “I was looking for pitches not to hit and didn’t plan to pull the trigger unless it was a perfect pitch.”
The Minutemen changed pitchers for the first time in yesterday’s game after the walk, sending in junior Leif Sorenson to relieve Benson. In the Crimson’s next at-bat, senior shortstop Sean O’Hara put Colton in scoring position with a sacrifice bunt before Moskovits stepped up to the plate to seal the deal.
“[Sorenson] was throwing pretty fast,” Moskovits said. “I just wanted to put the ball in play and hit it hard. The first pitch was fastball and I swung and missed. He threw another fastball and I barreled up and shot a single up the middle.”
Strong pitching on both sides contributed to the low-scoring game. Senior right-hander Dan Berardo started on the mound for Harvard and pitched three no-hit innings. Junior right-hander Jonah Klees, who came in to relieve, picked up right where Berardo left off, allowing just one hit in the sixth after two hitless frames.
“Our pitchers pretty much dominated all game,” Moskovits said. “UMass just had no idea what to do with them. They really kept us in the game.”
Senior right-hander Andrew Hatch earned the win on the mound for the Crimson, striking out three UMass batters in as many innings to close the game.
“We played good defense and our pitching was excellent,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “We were pounding the strike zone all game...Tyler [Albright] threw out three runners, which really helped us and helped the pitchers getting out of certain situations. He had a great game behind the plate.”
Despite the game’s low score, neither team was without opportunities in the first eight innings.
“During the course of the game, we had guys in scoring position with two outs...and just didn’t deliver,” Walsh said. “You just had this feeling that one run was going to win it.”
Harvard earned 10 hits on the day, with O’Hara, freshman third baseman Jake McGuiggan, and junior first baseman Marcus Way each contributing two, though neither team was able to capitalize on the early chances.
“It was a tough day to hit, because it was pretty dark and cold,” Moskovits said. “So we knew it was going to be a low-scoring game. Luckily, we managed to squeeze out a run at the end.”
A victory in the Beanpot carries added importance, as the tournament pins Massachusetts rivals BC, Northeastern, Harvard, and UMass against one another in for the only time each season.
“It’s definitely not just any other game,” Moskovits said. “We try to go into every game with the intention of winning, but [the fact that it’s a Beanpot game] makes it more meaningful.”
With the victory, Harvard earned a chance to take on the Eagles—who defeated Northeastern, 6-1, in yesterday’s other semifinal matchup—for Boston-area bragging rights in the Beanpot finale next Tuesday at Fenway Park.
“[Beanpot] games are always pretty intense, especially because the championship is at Fenway,” Moskovits said. “Everyone loves to play there. We’re definitely looking forward to that and to hopefully stomping on BC next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Countless greats have already done it. Fred McGriff has done it. John Calipari has done it.
This year, Jeremy Lin '10 gets his first shot at hosting a summer camp.
The camp, which runs from June 27 to July 1, is hosted by Palo Alto High School and is open to first through 12th graders.
It focuses, of course, on training in the fundamentals of basketball. But for the non-NBA aspirants among the group, the bigger prize might be the plethora of Lin gear and memorabilia that comes with the $350 camp fee.
Given that a high school gymnasium is hosting the camp, enrollment figures presumably are not expected to be too high.
But although Lin spent most of his rookie season on the bench, he developed a strong following in San Francisco. As the first Asian-American to play in the NBA in the better part of six decades, he gathered significant fan support in a city with a large Asian community.
Lin ended his season on a high note, scoring 12 points with five rebounds and five assists in the final game of the season. But his role on the team remains uncertain in the coming years.
At the very least, he gets to look forward to a week of eager grade-schoolers this summer vacation.

It's not every day that a Harvard student gets into a brawl. However, the Harvard College Interactive Media Group wants to change that for a day.   On April 24, they are holding a Super Smash Bros. Brawl tournament from 4 p.m. till 7 p.m. in the small dining room in Mather.
The event is open to all Harvard and MIT students, and the tournament includes a "brawl" bracket as well as an optional "melee" version. As an added bonus, food will be provided to all the participants.
"There are a lot of people on campus who play video games," said Benjamin A. Cohen '13, one of the event organizers, "but usually they can't find the other people on campus who play the same video games or have a system."
The tournament is double elimination, and each player should be aware of all of the rules in order to avoid disqualification for unsportsmanlike conduct or other infractions.
HCIMG has also developed a list of a ways to choose the stages to make it as fair as possible for the players, as well as making character selection private.  An entire list of rules for the tournament is available on their website.
So, in order to get those virtual bragging rights, be sure to prepare sufficiently and make the right moves. Playing with Kirby instead of Bowser could make all the difference.

Most people haven't ran a marathon or raised a significant amount of money while training. Neither are easy tasks, but Dawn A.T. Brimmer '12 wants to prove that she can do both.
As most of the student body was recovering from the previous night's Yardfest festivities or just trying to get to class on time, Brimmer was running her first Boston Marathon.
Brimmer promised the PBHA Summer Urban Program that she would raise $3,000 by May 1.
"I'm at about $777 dollars, but last Friday I only had about $300, so hopefully that's a sign that it will start picking up," Brimmer said.
Although Brimmer still needs significant contributions, she's confident she can make it happen by buying and delivering cannolis from Mike's Pastries.
"Cannolis are the one thing that people really like, but can't get as easily, because they're out in the North End. I know it will work this way," Brimmer said.
But in the end, this fundraising won't just be helping out the PBHA program. As Brimmer explained, "Running often feels like an individual sport, but knowing that people were tracking my progress, the 26.2 miles felt more of like a team effort."
Although the first round of cannoli orders has been completed, Brimmer said that she will continue to set up fundraisers in the next couple of weeks. So look out for the emails on your House email lists so that you can get a cannoli delivered right to your door!

As the year winds down, HUHDS has been gracing dining halls near you with exciting themed meals. On Tuesday, dining halls served Japanese food in solidarity with disaster victims on the other side of the world. Tonight, HUHDS brings us its annual sustainability dinner, featuring eco-friendly local foods like carved whole chicken, steamed mussels, and fresh vegetables.
As we look forward to tonight's environmentally conscious fare, Flyby has dreamed up a few suggestions for more meals to be added to the calendar.
May Day Meal
We have seders supported by HUHDS food and fish every Friday for the Catholics. Why not commemorate a pagan holiday? A HUHDS May Day feast would feature whatever food is typically found around the Maypole—what exactly do pagans eat?
A HUHDS Easter
In recognition of the holiday, HUHDS can perform a miracle: resurrect the dearly missed campus-wide favorite, Korean BBQ.
Grilled Cheese Night
April is National Grilled Cheese Month. One day this month, HUHDS should feature a balanced meal of grilled cheese—grilled cheese with bacon, for protein; grilled cheese with tomatoes and kale, for vegetables; and just plain ol' grilled cheese for the vegetarian option.
Eat What You Want Meal
On May 11, the nation celebrates the little-known holiday Eat What You Want Day. In honor of this occasion, HUHDS can hand the kitchens over to the students, letting them pick what to cook and eat.
