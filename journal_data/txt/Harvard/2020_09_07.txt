After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard Law School students and faculty prepare for a virtual fall semester, the school recently adopted a social media policy placing restrictions on the online sharing of statements made during class discussion.
Named the HLS Community Principle on Non-Attribution, the policy prohibits affiliates from publicly sharing in-class statements in a matter that would identify the speaker to anyone not present for the original discussion. Modeled after the internationally-recognized Chatham House Rule, it aims to protect students from potential widespread bullying or harassment for the opinions they express in class, according to the Law School’s website.
The policy argues the Law School must provide an environment in which students feel comfortable expressing their beliefs, exploring new ideas, or asking difficult questions. Law students are also often asked to advocate for opinions contrary to their own for the sake of class debate.
“Everybody is learning, everybody has to think and respond within fast-moving discussions, and everybody will make mistakes as part of the law school learning process,” the policy reads. “In training to be the best lawyers they can be, students must be able to try arguments on for size, change their minds, and take risks.”
The policy claims social media may present a danger to this method of learning by taking statements out of context and making students afraid to participate fully.
“Because of the potential permanence and widespread dissemination of communications through social media and other forms of communication designed to reach members of the public, if statements made in class are quoted or described with attribution in those media, students may be reluctant to approach any question, particularly controversial ones, with the openness and vulnerability they need to grow as lawyers and to learn from one another,” it reads.
The new policy did not elicit a widespread reaction from students across campus, as several professors previously enacted similar rules in their own classrooms.
A similar policy has also been in place at the Harvard Business School. It lists “honesty and integrity” as essential “Community Values” and requires students to keep any personal and professional information shared in class confidential.
“The mission of Harvard Business School is to educate leaders who make a difference in the world,” the Business School’s website states. “Achieving this mission requires an environment of trust and mutual respect, free expression and inquiry, and a commitment to truth, excellence, and lifelong learning.”
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the new policy does not intend to entirely bar students from posting about in-class statements on social media. The policy also clarifies students may attribute statements made in class when reporting misconduct or seeking assistance from Law School or University administrators.
“Nothing in the policy addresses a student’s sharing classroom comments in accordance with the policy’s non-attribution principle, or sharing comments with attribution with others in the same course or in ‘interpersonal exchanges about class discussion,’” Neal wrote.
Still, Law School students on Twitter warned that the non-attribution rule will not stop them in the future from publicly calling out students who have made offensive in-class comments.
“For the record, nothing in the policy appears to apply after we graduate,” law student Andre R. Manuel wrote in a Tweet. “So consider this notice that if you say something racist in a class I'm in, I WILL bring the receipts to your Senate confirmation. Future 34-year old 5th Circuit nominees beware.”
The non-attribution rule follows an April incident in which Chance M. Fletcher — president of the Law School’s Federalist Society — was criticized online for cleaning a gun during a class held on Zoom. A screenshot of Fletcher holding the gun in class went viral across Twitter and was featured in several news publications.
The policy also arrives at a time when freedom of speech across universities has been widely debated. In a 2019 symposium hosted by the Law School’s Federalist Society, former Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse M. Panuccio declared a free speech crisis on college campuses. He pointed to a 2017 Gallup survey which found 60 percent of American college students agree that the climate on their campus prevents them from sharing their beliefs for fear of offending others.
“If that is what students believe — if they believe they are not free to freely explore, debate, and refine ideas in college — what is the purpose of being there?” Panuccio said in 2019. “These ideas: the freedom to speculate, to be wrong, and the freedom to refine and rebut speculation and error, lie at the very core of productive academic inquiry.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Developed by two recent College graduates, the Bridging Borders Project is an online, weekly series of recorded conversations with foreign leaders about their governments’ responses to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The project — which so far includes 11 episodes — has featured conversations with leaders like Prime Minister Lotay Tshering of Bhutan, President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus, and President Jonathan Nez of the Navajo Nation.
Incoming Harvard Medical School student and Rhodes Scholar Sai S. S. Rajagopal ’19, a co-host of the project, said he was initially inspired to explore the COVID-19 responses of various nations based on differences in response that he observed between the United States and Canada.
“We saw that the response in America was significantly slower and less meaningful than what was happening in Canada,” Rajagopal said. “So we thought that there was a way that we could kind of potentially create cross-talk if we could bring leaders onto our show from a lot of different nations and hopefully cue in the American listener to get them hearing what was happening in other countries and how they were successfully, or not, responding to the pandemic.”
Project co-host Henna Hundal ’19 said she and Rajagopal were friends during their time at the College, which helped spark the project.
“Sai and I were the first people that we each met when we arrived at Harvard, so it has been a fruitful partnership,” Hundal said. “I would say that we both bring a genuine curiosity, which is so important, since we do hours and hours of research just trying to understand the context before going into each episode.”
Rajagopal noted the project has so far unearthed border regulation to be one of the most disparate pandemic policy measures among nations. He also shared, however, that many leaders are in agreement over the importance of “deferring to the expertise of healthcare experts.”
Rajagopal noted while the project currently consists of recorded interviews, he and Hundal will soon launch a new policy comparison tool on the project website freely available to the public. The resource will track policy metrics — such as border regulation and economic recovery program implementation timelines — and their impact on COVID-19 case counts using government data.
Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology professor Richard T. Lee ’79, who mentored Hundal when she was an undergraduate researcher in his lab, wrote in an email that he hopes “we have more efforts like this in the future.”
“The pandemic has shown how small the world is, and public health in the US requires that we also engage and understand other countries,” Lee wrote.
Hundal pointed out while the project has revealed unique approaches each nation has taken in response to the pandemic, leaders generally want to deliver similar messages about the crisis to other nations.
“What’s so heartening to find is that that message is always rooted in collaboration and cooperation and societies working together, and how through working together we can find ourselves on the better side of this crisis,” Hundal said. “I would say that’s a running theme that is very uplifting to see, that even during very challenging times like this we have leaders who are not siloed, who are trying to build bridges.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After being paired up at Massachusetts General Hospital for a curricular component during their first year of medical school, second-year Harvard Medical School students Samantha J. Sadler and Jennifer E. Rowley discovered that they each lived with serious medical conditions.
When the two opened up to each other about their conditions, according to Sadler, they began looking into the prevalence of medical school students with chronic illnesses, health conditions, or disabilities, searching for a community of individuals who shared similar experiences to their own.
They also began discussing the idea of a creative project to highlight the narratives and experiences of these students.
Those early conversations led to the formation of UNCONDITIONAL Publishing, a digital platform dedicated to increasing visibility, representation, and advocacy for students who have experienced or are currently living with illnesses, health conditions, or disabilities.
“In addition to just empowering the students who live with these narratives, we also want to draw attention to the importance of inclusion of these students as a component of diversity, and as a very special, important, and valuable part of our patient care experiences, rather than things that we should be implicitly or explicitly encouraged to keep quiet,” Sadler said.
King T. Fok, a classmate of Sadler and Rowley who is also involved with the project, said the UNCONDITIONAL Publishing team hopes to shift the narrative that having health conditions or disabilities prevents individuals from pursuing medical careers. In fact, these experiences can serve as assets, according to Fok.
“What brought us to medicine is having experienced these conditions, having met the people that really understood us and treated us well like human beings first,” Fok said. “It drew us closer towards medicine in that we think that it helps us connect with patients more.”
Fok said the leaders of the project hope to create a community of trust where students can be vulnerable and “offer all of ourselves to medicine” without conditions.
“The name UNCONDITIONAL is the idea that we’re not defined by our health conditions, that we live unafraid, without condition, and we’re unconditionally ourselves and unapologetically ourselves,” Fok said.
Sadler said their classmates and instructors at the Medical School have been “incredibly supportive” of UNCONDITIONAL’s first volume, which features Rowley’s own personal experiences managing a chronic condition as a medical student.
The project’s faculty advisor — Dorothy W. Tolchin ’01, a disability educator at the Medical School — said the team has helped “increase the visibility” of students living with chronic illnesses, health conditions, and disabilities.
“UNCONDITIONAL is really helping to deepen students’ connections to considerations around disability, illnesses, and health conditions,” Tolchin said. “I feel very strongly that their work will really help to reinforce the other curricular and advocacy work going on at Harvard Medical School right now, so it’s just a really exciting time.”
The UNCONDITIONAL project has also garnered national attention in the past month. The student leaders were invited to head a ten-day discussion forum by the New England Journal of Medicine, a leading journal in medical research.
“We covered different topics every day, ranging from accommodations to disclosure to different ways that we can engage,” Fok said. “Experts, faculty, and other people, like other students as well as those interested in this work, were able to do that online.”
With the growing media attention and support from faculty members and classmates at the Medical School, Sadler said the team is excited to continue pushing forward new ideas and engage with a broader audience.
“The momentum we have is very humbling and quite unexpected,” Sadler said. “We are looking forward to seeing more and more people engaged in the platform.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2020, 6:16 p.m.
In their first meeting of the fall semester, Harvard’s Undergraduate Council unanimously voted to pass a statement condemning Harvard’s possession of images taken of slaves that is at the center of an ongoing lawsuit.
Tamara K. Lanier sued the University last year to gain rights to the daguerreotypes, which scholars believe are some of the oldest images of slaves. They depict Lanier’s great-great-great-grandfather, Renty, and his daughter, Delia, according to her complaint.
The Act called on the Council to sign a petition demanding that Harvard give the daguerreotypes to Renty and Delia’s descendants. It also condemned the University’s ongoing possession of the images, which Harvard houses in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
“President Bacow, it is not your place, nor is it the place of the University or affiliated institutions, to claim ownership under the law for Renty and Delia. Let them go home, and begin to set a new standard for Harvard that all students, faculty and the community can respect,” the legislation read.
The Act asked Council members to “imagine your great grandparents were enslaved, exploited, forced to strip naked, photographed against their will, those photographs are publicly shared today...and there was nothing you could do about it.”
UC treasurer Noah A. Harris ’22 and Ivy Yard Representative Chloe E.V. Koulefianou ’23 sponsored the legislation supporting Lanier’s suit alongside the UC’s Black Caucus.
“We felt that it was our obligation to speak up about the photos that Harvard is profiting off of, of Renty and his daughter Delia,” Harris said. “There are amazing students doing great things with GAASA, the Generational African American Student Association, as well as the coalition of students working on this, and we just wanted to elevate their work that they’re doing as well as call out Harvard.”
“It’s one thing to not admit wrongdoing in the past, but it’s another thing to bring that wrongdoing and then profit off of it in the past,” he added.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said last April that he believed the University had “the law on our side” with regard to the lawsuit. He added that any profits Harvard makes in connection with the images are “nominal.”
The University previously charged a processing fee to account for charges associated with copying the images. As of September 1, it will not charge any fees unless new photographs are necessary.
Lanier’s lawyer, Benjamin L. Crump, has previously said that Harvard’s ongoing possession of the images amounts to “saying to Tammy Lanier and her family that Renty still is a slave, he still does not own his image.”
In response to the resolution, FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane pointed to a group Bacow formed last fall aimed at addressing Harvard's ties to slavery, among other initiatives.
The petition to give the photographs to Lanier has garnered over 1,000 signatures, of which at least 200 are Harvard affiliates.
In addition to voting on the daguerreotypes, Council members also discussed gender imbalances within the group, according to UC Technology and Communications Director Esther J. Xiang ’23. Of the Council’s 26 current members, 17 are men.
“The UC is this majority male body, and there’s a lot of male-dominated spaces,” said Xiang. “Gender bias is definitely something that we need to be thinking about.”
