After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last last seven years, the world of television has seen a rise in the creation of funny and often painfully realistic shows about the lives of millennial women. To name a few: Issa Rae’s “Insecure,” Lena Dunham’s contentious “Girls,” the Comedy Central hit “Broad City,” and “Fleabag” by British television creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The verisimilitude achieved in all of these shows is so striking that they often become difficult to watch, as was the case for many viewers of Dunham’s show. On all of these shows, the most pessimistic moments of millennial life are delivered with a wry and unforgiving tone. Hulu’s new TV show “Shrill” takes a more bubbly approach to millennial life, and not always with much success.
“Shrill,” which began streaming on Hulu last month, follows Annie Easton, a “fat young woman who wants to change her life — but not her body,” according to Hulu’s description. Annie is played by “Saturday Night Live’s” Aidy Bryant, who is also one of the show’s writers and producers.
“Shrill” has none of Dunham’s pessimism or “Broad City”’s mocking humor. It’s, in fact, quite, cheerful. Annie and her best friend Fran (Lolly Adefope) wrap their arms around one another, jump up and down, and scream “yay” at least once every episode. Bryant’s lines are punctuated with a little giggle at the end. The show’s score, composed by Craig Wedren and Anna Waronker, is a 2019 update on the sappy “Gilmore Girls” one — it’s mainly just acoustic guitar strums, cued whenever Annie is walking around the streets of Portland, having an existential moment. With characters constantly exchanging pleasantries and a pastel-toned set, “Shrill” is sentimental.
That isn’t to say that “Shrill” is only a feel-good show: It tackles serious topics. In the first episode alone, Annie is fat-shamed on multiple occasions, visits her father who’s battling cancer, and gets an abortion. But through the eyes of Annie, “Shrill” has a hopefulness, an excitement about life that other shows in its genre opt out of in favor of a cynical world-weariness. Even when she is assigned to review the underwhelming, gross, and greasy weekday lunch buffet at a local strip club, Annie remains excited: “I’m actually a journalist,” she gushes to one of the strippers, “We’re both here workin’, doin’ our jobs,” she says.
When we first meet Annie, she deals with other people’s horrible treatment of her and her plus-sized body by being sweet and easy-going. When a personal-trainer insults her in a coffee shop, Annie grins and bears it. When Ryan (Luka Jones), her “friend with benefits,” makes her leave his house through the back-door, she laughs and nods. When her boss refers to her as a “millennial dumpling,” she thanks him.
Annie’s search for self-empowerment doesn’t come without its consequences. In the final episodes of the season, Annie is accused time and time again by Fran, her colleagues, and her parents of being selfish, an accusation that is both illogical and misogynistic. This selfishness is artificially induced: Never do Annie’s actions actually appear selfish, rather they seem like actions of a twenty something women who’s just trying to figure herself out. Annie’s father calls her “a little brat” after Annie criticizes her mother for trying to control her calorie intake. And, in the season finale, Annie’s colleague tells her, “It seems like you’re way more interested in yourself than anyone else,” after Annie complains about being recently jobless. The show’s argument that selfishness is a byproduct of female empowerment is a disconcertingly conservative one.
An even more disconcerting part of “Shrill” is its treatment of characters of color. On “Shrill,” characters of color only exist to deal with Annie’s emotional turbulence. Annie is the victim of a lot of fatphobia throughout the season while Fran, a black lesbian woman, seems to just glide through life. Never do we hear anything about her struggles. Fran serves as audience to Annie’s many rants and even accompanies her into the examination room where she gets an abortion, but she never has a fully developed plot of her own.
The biggest shortcoming of the show, however, is that it’s about Annie’s circumstances and not about Annie herself. When Annie has an article published, she is happy. When Annie and Ryan fight, she is sad. Rarely is there a dissonance between Annie’s life circumstances and how she is feeling. More often than not, there is a disconnect between how we feel and how wonderfully or horribly our lives are going. The ability to depict such a dissonance is what makes for mimetic, moving art. “Shrill” very rarely has such an ability except in Episode Four when Annie attends a pool party for plus-sized women. This episode explores Annie as a person, and not Annie as a product of whatever good or bad thing happened to her that day.
Maybe the very best moment of “Shrill” is the last few seconds of Episode One. Annie’s just been called a “fat bitch” as she’s walking down a busy street. Rather than getting upset, Annie swallows back whatever pain she’s feeling and forces herself to keep walking. As Tierra Whack’s fantastic “Pretty Ugly” begins to play, this walk turns into a strut. Annie’s smile reveals as much pain as it does steadfastness. Bryant’s performance is so convincing here — we can see the thoughts racing through Annie’s head. Hopefully, in Season Two, “Shrill” can add to the cheerful tone its achieved an embrace of emotional gradation rather than meekly backing down from it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Was Harvard everything you dreamed it would be?”
A dear friend recently queried me during a meal in the Mather House dining hall, with Cambridge glowing crimson during another spectacular spring sunset. I could only smile and chuckle gently as I attempted to collect my thoughts. Where to begin? Where to end? Who to thank? What to lament? What to celebrate? What pithy summation or epithet to offer? The best I could do was laugh and say, “I’ll have to get back to you with a Crimson column!” (For which I got an eye-roll and bemused sigh.)
Now the moment has come to deliver that response. As with every column I’ve written, I’m afraid I won’t ultimately be able to utter the words that are truly on my heart, only mirages and flickering images that will not do justice to the realities they attempt to represent. This likely won’t be a very traditional opinion column, for I do not wish to comment on policies or procedures, chastise, critique, or condemn. I do not believe that it will tend compellingly towards artistic or eloquent either. Whatever it shall be, this column will not come close to capturing my four years here.
But I must try to do so, at the very least to celebrate the friends, mentors, scholarship, trials (yes, even hardships), and triumphs that shaped my Harvard experience. I think the best answer to my friend’s question starts is a simple story from the woods and barracks of Fort Knox, Kentucky. Lest you should think from that introduction that I was out with the U.S. Army stoically soldiering or learning super-cool tactical maneuvers, I was not.
For most of that brief month before my senior year I was trying desperately not to fall asleep on my security watches, marching a few miles every day, and listening to my stomach growl for the M&Ms in my next ration. My body was on full auto-pilot, leaving my mind free to wander far, far from Fort Knox. In usual flashes of missing home, I often thought of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado or how my family was celebrating July 4th without me.
I soon realized I was also homesick for Harvard. On those long marches with nothing else to do but think, I’d pass the time by imagining, as vividly and viscerally as I could, walking back from the Science Center to Mather House in the cooling September twilight, counting every step, conversing with a few dear friends on my way back to the concrete jungle. Or I’d visualize biking across the river to a rugby practice in the crisp autumn afternoon and greeting every one of my teammates, or running along the Charles during sunrise joking with my cadets.
These moments added up, and I realized with joy how much I loved Harvard and the seemingly small and most routine elements of my existence here. Every day, I heard laughter and impassioned debate ring out in whatever dining hall I was in. Every day, I saw people greeting each other in between classes with hugs and high fives and smiles (even in the worst of weather conditions). Every day I ran into a friend, instructor, teammate, unexpected freshman acquaintance, someone who made my day better for having seen them only for one moment. Every day, I read about a classmate who had made a major academic or athletic accomplishment and felt a flash of genuine pride.
If I were to comb through the history of all the time I’d spent here, I do believe that I’d find something good in every day. Now, we’d almost be forgiven for believing that nothing good ever happened here, because no one writes op-eds or protests or petitions or becomes an activist to celebrate the good that does exist at Harvard. This is not to say, of course, that there weren’t bad days or bad weeks or even bad months for us here. There remain many aspects of Harvard life that are challenging, restrictive, and overwhelming, and we nobly attempt to try to set such a world aright.
It is perhaps only now in the bliss of senior spring that I can write that the side of Harvard that contains authentic joy, friendship, spirit, and pride is more pervasive, more powerful, and more profound than we might imagine. I cannot possibly hope to thank everyone who has made Harvard such a place for me.
To my all friends, coaches, professors, and Crimson editors who helped me share so much of my journey here, I could never have imagined how much of an impact you have made on me — thank you. My final answer to the question that my friend raised is thus: Harvard wasn’t what I dreamed at all, for how could I have dreamed of an adventure whose twists and turns I scarcely could have imagined?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When we were elected last semester to serve as president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council — an election that, like many UC presidential elections, is highly visible and garners far greater turnout than House or Yard elections — we had high aspirations to positively impact undergraduate student life through a series of legislative and non-legislative initiatives.
Today, those aspirations are under threat.
About three weeks ago, a fellow representative brought to our attention that the UC Constitution does not explicitly denote membership to the president and vice president. Despite this ambiguity, the Council had allowed their membership for the past 40 years. When we discovered this vagueness, we promptly submitted a constitutional amendment that would clarify the roles of the president and vice president as members of the Undergraduate Council, maintaining the precedent of the past four decades. In the end, 80 percent of the 34 UC representatives present at the Council’s last general meeting of the semester voted in favor of our amendment.
However, another procedural complication rendered our vote invalid. Six UC representatives opposed to our amendment abstained, invalidating the vote due to a provision that requires at least two-thirds of all UC representatives to vote “yes” or “no” to pass a constitutional amendment. Due to the power this small group held to invalidate this vote, as of now, the president and vice president are not considered members of the Council, inhibiting, among other things, their ability to vote and sponsor legislation.
Without the ability to sponsor legislation, the president and vice president have virtually no means by which to advance the platform on which they ran and were elected by a plurality of the student body. Without an ability to introduce or vote on legislation, the voices of all students who voted on and believed in the elected president and vice president — the representatives with the most visibility and accountability to the student body — are effectively silenced in the Council’s decisions. Without the ability to influence any of the decisions of the UC, why would administrators like University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, or Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana make the time to meet with the UC president and vice president?
The UC president and vice president now have responsibility without authority. They are held accountable for all actions of the Council, but lack the ability to sway decision-making or effectively carry out their vision.
The UC president and vice president have no power to veto legislation, nor can they issue executive orders — virtually nullifying any form of “executive power” traditionally awarded to the executive branch. Because they lack “executive power” to begin with, to strip them of their ability to vote or sponsor legislation renders them merely figureheads within the legislative context of the Council. As the president and vice president are the only student representatives elected through a student body-wide election, they carry a distinct obligation to promote and sponsor legislation intended to benefit the entire undergraduate population. This perspective is what allows the president and vice president to add unique value to the Council’s collective work. They are not at odds with the rest of the Council but rather unified around the interest of serving students. Halting their participation through voting or sponsorship of legislation in the Council sets UC in conflict with its own mission to represent and support the undergraduate student population.
In the past, the president and vice president have voted on and sponsored important and beneficial legislation. This includes 2016 President and Vice President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Danny V. Banks’ ’17 “Grant for an Open Harvard College,” which to this day funds large-scale student events that address one of our compelling interests: mental health, financial accessibility, sexual assault prevention and response, social spaces, and race relations. Over the past three years, this grant has funded over 50 large-scale events and initiatives like the Harvard Student Art Show, summer storage subsidies for students in renovated houses, Your Mental Health Matters Week, the Latina Empowerment and Development Conference and student projects over Wintersession 2018-19. Our predecessors Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 started Harvard Conversations, a program that has continued past their tenure to connect students and faculty for small, informal dinner conversations. Even in our first semester, we passed legislation for the Social Inclusion Grant, which aims to make organizing inclusive social events more accessible to students. We also piloted a class-wide event for the Class of 2020 in which 400 juniors attended, the success of which speaks to the need for expanded class-wide programming for sophomores and juniors. The ability of the UC’s leaders to vote on and sponsor legislation has produced substantial improvements to undergraduate student life. But future improvements have now been made substantially more difficult.
As student leaders working every day to improve the Harvard community, we never dreamed that our roles would be stripped of membership on the very Council where the president and vice president have been voting and sponsoring legislation since its founding, 40 years ago.
The Harvard Undergraduate Council and Harvard College student body at-large now need to grapple with the question of whether stripping the president and vice president of their voting rights or ability to sponsor legislation actually helps make the Council more effective or representative in its service to the student body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their last meeting of the semester, the Undergraduate Council voted on two proposals which, taken together, overturn over 40 years of precedent to prohibit the president and vice president from voting on or sponsoring legislation. These proposals — which their sponsors saw fit to call the “Great Reform” — were introduced after a representative questioned the wording of a portion of the UC’s Constitution, sparking debate on whether “executive officers” were eligible to vote. The controversy centered on the fact that, as defined by its constitution, the president and vice president are technically not “members” of the Council.
The fact that debate over this constitutional technicality occupied the UC’s attention for a week is uncommonly silly, not to mention disappointing. Rather than focusing upon purely parliamentary matters, the UC would do better to actively turn its attention towards more salient issues on which it may better serve the student body its members have been elected to represent.
The gravity of choosing whether to overturn four decades of precedent is not lost upon us. To this end, the portions of the UC’s meeting time spent discussing and deliberating upon the practical impacts of removing their executive officers’ voting and sponsorship privileges appear reasonable, as this decision significantly impacts the way the Council operates from this point forward. Such relevant discussion points include concerns raised by representatives who cautioned against disenfranchising the only two members of the UC whose platform is held accountable to the entire student body. Given that the president and vice president of the UC have lost the power to propose legislation, we fear the student body’s ability to hold them and future UC executive officers accountable for their campaign promises — as we believe they must — have been thrown into question.
Irrespective of the practical impacts these proposals may have on the functioning of the UC, the fact remains that the only proposal passed by the UC during its deliberations on this topic did not grapple directly with the issue at hand at all — rather, it solely established which UC members may interpret the organization’s constitution. The purely bureaucratic nature of this proposal — which its sponsors, in a baffling and self-aggrandizing display, dubbed the “Great Compromise” — and the base fact that this entire issue was precipitated on the basis of a minute, constitutional detail strikes us as downright whimsical, not to mention indicative of the body’s ineffectuality. As this Board has previously opined, the UC would do better to spend its time and energies working actively to assist and represent the College’s student body, rather than debating parliamentary issues we doubt are ever at the forefront of students’ minds.
It is obviously preferable that the Council function under clearly defined parliamentary procedures, but dedicating extensive bandwidth to such issues ignores the litany of more relevant matters that UC members, as elected representatives, would do well to emphasize instead. The nature of the UC’s “Great Reform” exemplifies the dysfunctionalities present within the UC, which have motivated this board in the past to call for dramatic reorganization of the body, including restricting its purview to funding student organizations. These recommendations, which we reaffirm today, are drastic but reflect the reality of the UC as it functions today. Barring such radical reform, members of the UC must carefully consider their priorities. If they truly wish to represent the student body, their legislative priorities should reflect the priorities of those who elected them.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will review proposed updates to the College Student Handbook — including an overhaul of the College’s policies on drug and alcohol use — and decide the fate of “shopping week” at its last meeting of the semester Tuesday.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will present the proposed changes to the handbook for the 2019-2020 academic year to the Faculty for a vote. If approved, the updated handbook will largely alter the phrasing of the College’s “amnesty policy,” which grants intoxicated students under 21 exemption from University punishment in certain cases.
The new policy, dubbed the “Help-Seeking Policy,” continues the College’s practice of not disciplining students and bystanders for seeking medical treatment for intoxicated students. But while the original amnesty policy began with a pledge not to punish students, the new policy changes the original’s ordering and begins by stating administrators “expect students to abide by the law,” as well as Harvard drug and alcohol policies.
The College also eliminated multiple pages of rules from the handbook governing alcohol consumption in the Houses and at campus social events. The updated handbook omits a rule specifying that tutors must check in on all parties in the Houses, as well as regulations on House events including alcohol and on formals. The current handbook stipulates that event hosts must be present the entire time and verify attendees’ ages before serving them alcohol, but the proposed changes eliminate these rules completely.
Administrators also cut a campus-wide rule that stated only beer, wine, and malt beverages with under 15 percent alcohol content could be served at College social events.
In a February interview, Khurana said the College was reviewing the amnesty policy in response to a fall report on the April 2018 forcible arrest of a black undergraduate. The arrest coincided with Yardfest, the College’s annual spring concert, which saw 17 medical transports for intoxication and overdoses in 2018, at least five times more than in 2017.
Khurana said in February that the review came in response to concerns that the policy’s wording was confusing, citing questions over what behavior it “encourages” among undergraduates.
The other changes to the handbook reflect proposals the Faculty has voted on during the 2018-2019 academic year, including updates to the language requirement which remove the specification that students must take a language with a written component. Another change reflects the establishment of a new concurrent bachelor’s and master’s degree program that will replace Advanced Standing, the College’s previous dual degree program.
The updated handbook also includes a new section on General Education, explaining the changes to the program that will take effect this fall. Under the new program, students must fulfill four General Education requirements, three distributional requirements, and a Quantitative Reasoning with Data requirement that the faculty plans to vote on at the Tuesday meeting.
Under the new Quantitative Reasoning requirement, students will have to take either a course that fulfilled the College’s previous Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement, or a course from any department that FAS decides “will enable students to think critically about data.”
After months of research and deliberation, the full Faculty will also decide whether to keep “Shopping Week,” the time during which students can explore courses at the beginning of each semester before officially enrolling. A faculty committee tasked with studying the issue found insufficient evidence that shopping week alone was to blame for issues that some say plague the current system, including financial uncertainty for teaching fellows and reduced instruction time.
The committee proposed that the College keep shopping week until at least 2022. FAS will form a new committee to review course registration at that time. The proposal faced minimal resistance at last month’s Faculty meeting.
Multiple faculty members appeared more skeptical of legislation to establish a master’s degree in biotechnology, which would be overseen by Harvard Business School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Medical Anthropology Professor Arthur Kleinman, for example, asked for assurance that the proposed degree program would incorporate discussion of the “unintended consequences” of these medical innovations.
The Faculty will also vote to approve FAS and Harvard Extension School course offerings — including General Education courses that fulfill the College’s new requirements — for the 2019-2020 academic year at Tuesday’s meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said it would be “inappropriate” for Harvard to remove the Sackler family name from campus buildings and return any past donations from the family in an interview Friday.
In June 2018, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 submitted a court filing as part of a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma — a pharmaceutical company owned by the Sackler family that produces the painkiller OxyContin — alleging that members of the Sackler family who have served on the company’s board of directors oversaw marketing techniques that have been linked to the opioid epidemic.
Arthur M. Sackler donated significant funds to Harvard to name the school’s museum collection of Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean art after him. Sackler passed away roughly a decade before OxyContin came to market and his stake in the company was sold to his brothers. Many activists, however, blame him for the aggressive advertising tactics he helped pioneer, which they say Purdue sales representatives later used to push the drug.
In recent months, dozens of mothers whose children died from opioid overdoses wrote letters to Bacow urging him to cut ties with the Sacklers and refuse future funding from them.
In response to the letter, Bacow wrote in March he was “deeply moved” by the mothers’ stories and photographs, but the University did not have plans to remove Sackler’s name. In addition to “legal and contractual considerations,” Bacow also noted that Arthur Sackler had passed away before OxyContin was developed and marketed.
On Friday, Bacow reiterated his previous statement that the Sacklers gave their donation before the development of the drug.
“I've said, on the record, in the case of the Sackler family, the gift that we received from Dr. Sackler was a gift that was made before Oxycontin had ever been developed” he said.
Bacow also maintained that the University will not return the gift.
“Dr. Arthur Sackler died before the drug was developed. His family sold their interest in the company before the drug was developed,” Bacow said. “And I think it would be inappropriate for the university to either return the gift or take Dr. Sackler's name off the building that his gift supported given that he had absolutely no relationship to it.”
Activists have long called on Harvard to remove the Sackler name from University buildings, but renewed their efforts after Healey filed a memo in the case in January 2019. Activists then circulated a petition addressed to Bacow entitled “Tell Harvard: Cut Ties With Makers of OxyContin.” The petition has garnered 14,746 signatures as of Sunday afternoon.
More than 1,600 lawsuits have now been filed in state and federal court against Purdue, which is considering filing for bankruptcy. The lawsuits have uncovered the company’s tactics used to promote the painkiller even after its executives were aware of the drug’s potential for abuse.
In late March, Purdue and members of the Sackler family agreed to pay $270 million to settle an Oklahoma lawsuit. Other suits — including one in Massachusetts — may still be fought out in court.

Scholars from more than 800 institutions worldwide have signed an open letter — written by two Harvard graduate students — in response to Brazil’s plan to disinvest in philosophy and sociology at public universities.
Last Friday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tweeted his support for a policy proposal to cut funding from philosophy and sociology departments at public universities in Brazil.
In the days following, two Ph.D. students in the Sociology department, Derick S. Baum and Mo Torres, drafted a letter calling for continued funding of these disciplines. Baum and Torres said the letter received 200 signatures within the first 24 hours, and the number of signatures have now grown to more than 9000.
Among those signatures are 83 Harvard faculty and graduate students from sociology and other departments; the president of the International Sociological Association; and presidents of sociological associations in Poland, Israel, Greece, and Australia, according to Baum.
“I think it just speaks to the fact that sociologists are aware that this is not a person — or Brazil — specific issue, that this is very much a global issue,” said Torres in an interview Wednesday.
Baum, who was born and raised in Brazil, said he felt a personal draw to get involved, and being a sociologist gave him even more of an impetus.
“When sociology and the social sciences get threatened, like with what’s happening right now in Brazil, we need to mobilize to try to do something,” Baum said.
Sociology Professor Jocelyn Viterna, who signed the letter, said she felt a similar “concern” and urgency.
“Anytime a political party tries to limit the creation and the development of knowledge, particularly knowledge about power and inequality and society, that is a cause for concern,” Viterna said.
Baum called the policy an "attack on Brazilian democracy."
“This policy is not only an attack on education, it’s an attack on Brazilian democracy. I want to be as clear as possible about the gravity of this,” Baum said. “Brazil is the fourth largest democracy in the world, but we’re quickly walking toward becoming one of the largest fascist regimes.”
By dictating how universities should manage their resources, Baum said the Brazilian government is acting directly against the principles of autonomy explicitly stated in the country’s Constitution.
While the stated rationale behind the proposal is market-based logic of funding more “lucrative” professions, Baum said the real reason is the social sciences’ perceived threat to Bolsonaro’s power. By cutting funds, “the government is deliberately suppressing the opposition,” Baum said.
The Brazilian government could not be reached for comment regarding its policy proposal or actions.
Viterna explained that Bolsonaro’s move is a common pattern seen in dictatorships.
“This is something that we regularly see when dictators show, or when politicians begin to show, more dictatorial tendencies, what they do is they crack down on intellectual thought,” she said.
While uncertain if the letter will bring about any change in Brazilian policy, Viterna said she believes it is a “symbolic” show of force.
“Most of what these letters do is send the message to the politician that the world is watching, the world is aware of what they're doing,” she said.
Torres and Baum both voiced similar sentiments.
“It might not lead anywhere, but we’re bringing some noise, we’re letting the world know about what’s happening,” Baum said.
Correction: May 7, 2019
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated Baum is currently doing research in Brazil. In fact, Torres is doing research in Brazil.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Holding red and black posters reading “Reclaim Winthrop” and “#MeToo,” three student groups staged a sit-in in the Winthrop House dining hall Friday amid controversy surrounding Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
Our Harvard Can Do Better — an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization — read a list of demands at the event, including calling on the College to publicize the results of a climate review of Winthrop House and to create a system to hold faculty deans accountable. They also demanded that Sullivan apologize to house affiliates and delegate his ceremonial duties during Commencement to “an alternate,” and called for an “end to intimidation tactics.”
In an interview Sunday, Our Harvard Can Do Better member Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 said the groups have demanded that the administration complete the review and announce what action it would take by May 29.
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment. College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the students’ demands.
The Association of Black Harvard Women and Student Labor Action Movement also sponsored the event. Our Harvard Can Do Better member Remedy H. Ryan ’21 wrote in a text that 178 undergraduates put their names on a sign-in sheet the organization distributed. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also attended part of the event.
Since Sullivan announced his decision to represent Weinstein in late January, students have spoken out at protests and written posts calling for him to step down as faculty dean — arguing that his representation of Weinstein is inconsistent with his role as the dean of an undergraduate house.
The College announced in February that former Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 would conduct a climate review of Winthrop as a result of student concerns over Sullivan’s decision. As part of the review, administrators circulated a survey among Winthrop undergraduates, asking students to rate the house on a variety of metrics like homophobia, elitism, and friendliness.
The controversy in Winthrop House escalated in April when Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20 — a Crimson design editor and activist who has led calls for Sullivan to step down as faculty dean — and Winthrop tutor Carl L. Miller filed conflicting police reports against each other after a confrontation in the house dining hall.
Following the incident, Miller and his wife, Winthrop tutor Valencia Miller, sued Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe for defamation in part because O’Keefe sent an email to Eliot residents defending Mudannayake and calling the Millers’ conduct “unprofessional.”
The Millers’ lawyer, George J. Leontire, said he believes the student protesters have acted inappropriately towards his clients.
“They fully want the right to be able to disparage the Millers yet cry foul when Mr. Miller responds,” he said. “If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. If you're going to start harassing someone don't expect a response not to be forthcoming.”
Several students gave speeches at the event including Winthrop student Hakeem O. I. Angulu ’20; Phoebe H. Suh ’22, a freshman placed into Winthrop who has called for Sullivan to step down; and ABHW political action chair Araoluwa P. Omotowa ’22.
Angulu said at the event that he believes Sullivan should step down both because of the impact of his decision to represent Weinstein and the way he has responded to student criticism.
“Let me be clear, the point about Harvey Weinstein deserving due process is a straw man argument and is a point that protesters have never disputed,” Angulu said. “The more specific and relevant point that we're trying to make is that Dean Sullivan does not have to provide the representation, and by providing, he is compromising his ability to serve survivors and his house.”
Omotowa said in an interview Sunday that ABHW’s board decided to co-sponsor the event because of the way Sullivan’s representation has affected their members. The organization previously sent a letter in February calling on Sullivan to resign from his post as faculty dean.
“Black women on this campus, especially queer minorities — which ABHW also distinctly cares about — are negatively impacted by emboldening rape culture on this campus. That’s why we felt personally, and as an organization, compelled to be on the forefront of this, calling Sullivan out for his actions,” Omotowa said.
She added that she hopes students and administrators will discuss both faculty deans’ roles within the Harvard residential system and the impact of rape culture at the College.
“I think that [next steps are] going to incorporate a lot more diverse training of faculty and administrators in terms of just understanding what rape culture is, how that affects students, how that inhibits our ability to learn, and also just occupies this campus in general,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A disabilities advocacy organization at the Harvard Graduate School of Education published the first edition of Disabilities Disclosed, a new journal focused on people’s experiences with disabilities, Monday.
The group, International Higher Education and Disabilities, published content online Saturday, and distributed printed copies Monday. The publication includes personal essays about experiences interacting with disability written by 12 students and alumni from the Graduate School of Education, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Kennedy School, and Harvard Law School.
Preparations for the publication began in November, when the initial call for submissions was sent out, according to Nikita F. Andersson and Miso Kwak, the organization’s co-chairs. Since then, editors have worked to solidify logistical details and prepare submissions for publication.
The Graduate School of Education provided funding for the publication and hosts the digital version on its website. Andersson and Kwak said they hope the journal will become a resource for students and faculty across Harvard’s schools.
“Our aim is to put it in libraries across Harvard, in all the accessibility offices, in all the graduate schools, so that everybody has access to it,” Andersson said. “Having students from Harvard tell their own experiences of having disabilities, or thinking about disability scholarship in a more critical way is just really important, because so many students go through this experience at this university.”
The co-chairs also said publishing students’ experiences may help alleviate the stigmas often associated with disability.
“Even though we don’t talk about it so much, and it is so stigmatized within this society, it’s something that most people inevitably have experienced, whether that is for themselves, or people they’re close to,” Kwak said. “I think it is a mistake if we don’t talk about it openly in this institution.”
Former Graduate School of Education Professor Thomas F. Hehir, who wrote the foreword for the volume, said the publication represents a shift in societal perceptions of people with disabilities.
“I think it’s part of a broader movement in the disability world where people with disabilities are claiming their identities and in a positive way,” Hehir said.
Hehir said the publication is particularly valuable at a school where many students are in one- or two-year programs and don’t have as long to make lasting change.
“The vast majority of our students are master's students, and they’re only here for a year, and so one of things that I think is important about this publication is it creates a sense of institutional memory,” Hehir said.
Andersson said ultimately the publication aims to shift norms surrounding disability, especially for those whose disabilities are not visible.
“So often, disability is not spoken about and can often manifest itself in a very invisible way,” Andersson said. “I think it’s important for students to feel comfortable talking about it more, so we start to change the norms around talking about disability.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Black Men’s Forum honored History and African and African American studies Professor Elizabeth Hinton at its 25th annual Celebration of Black Womxn gala Friday evening.
The event also honored a group of 12 senior women who had been nominated for activism and contributions to black student life. Unlike in previous years, however, all were given recognition and none were set apart as winners of any particular awards.
Hinton dedicated her 2019 Womxn of the Year award to all the black women in the room, including her unborn daughter, who is due in July; her great-great grandmother, who was born a slave; and her grandfather, who only received an eighth-grade education.
She also charged the gala attendees with reforming inequalities that black people face in the United States, including mass incarceration, police brutality, and unequal pay.
“We’ve got to keep supporting each other and other brothers and sisters who aren’t as fortunate to make it into the spaces,” she said. “As the future citizen leaders of this country, you have a special charge to make sure that we create a better world.”
BMF leadership said Hinton had worked closely with their organization throughout the year and had moderated a panel event they held on mass incarceration.
“She’s an inspiration to us, completely,” outgoing BMF President Johnny G. Powell ’20 said in an interview. “Her students have come to us personally saying that she deserved to be awarded, or acknowledged.”
Injil Muhammad ’21, the incoming BMF president and current vice president, added that Hinton was the perfect fit for the award.
“The woman of the year is supposed to be someone who exemplifies the standards of class, beauty, and excellence to the highest standard,” Muhammad said. “Professor Hinton is just someone who immediately came to mind as a figure in the community who does all of those things."
The event opened with a reception and celebration of all black womxn-identifying graduating seniors. The 12 nominated seniors each received recognition for their involvement in their community.
In past years, just a few seniors were selected from a pool of nominees and given special recognition for their contributions. The final selection processes, however, was “critiqued pretty heavily” for exclusivity, Powell said.
Muhammad said BMF wanted to empower the community to select the winners, and thus decided to give awards to all nominees.
“Community impact is not about the most public figure or the most popular but the ones who can help one person in one instance,” Muhammad said.
Attendees also honored the memory of Courtney S. Blair ’19, who passed away last summer, with an excerpt of Maya Angelou’s poem “Phenomenal Woman.”
Local high school senior Hellen M. Muma also recieved a $500 college scholarship given annually at the event meant to commend her dedication to public service and her academic achievements.
Powell said this was his favorite part of the event, since he loves recognizing “someone who represents the future of black women.”
Earlier in the week, event organizers hosted other events to show their appreciation for black women on campus, including a discussion of identities and black womanhood, a professional development panel with black women alumni, and a free photo shoot.
“I wanted this year people to feel BMF actually cared,” Powell said. “This year, we refashioned it to be more intentional with the events we threw to make sure they actually celebrated some facet of black womanhood.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard capped off a tough season on Saturday with a tough loss to Penn on Senior Day in front of nearly 600 fans.
The Crimson (6-9, 1-6 Ivy) hung around with the Quakers (12-5, 5-2) for a while, but after freshman midfielder Grace Hulslander evened the score at 4-4, Penn pulled away and never looked back to take a 17-9 victory.
Freshman midfielder Hulslander finished with three goals on the day, and attacker and captain Keeley MacAfee poured in four more in the last game of her illustrious career in Cambridge.
The loss completed a 2019 campaign marked by both inconsistency and promise.
Harvard started strong, taking three of its first five games, including a double-overtime thriller against Boston University.
In its ninth game, the squad dealt an 18-8 drubbing to rival Yale. It was a display of dominance that seemed to spell good fortunes for the rest of the year.
Then the team slipped heading into the heart of Ivy play, ending with a less-than-stellar overall record. However, there were a number of bright spots for the Crimson, including young talent: Hulslander shined in her freshman year with 29 goals, and sophomore attacker Madison Conklin racked up 15 goals and nine assists.
From a team standpoint, there were a number of encouraging close calls. The Crimson played No. 11 Denver tightly in the first half and lost a hard-fought game to No. 15 Princeton, 14-12.
Within the Ancient Eight, things easily could have gone differently. In addition to the Princeton game, Harvard lost to Dartmouth 15-11, fell to Columbia 15-14, and, in its last away game, dropped a showdown with Brown, 10-9.
Rookie head coach Devon Wills now officially has one season with the Crimson under her belt.
“I am really proud of the team and the improvements that they made throughout the season,” she said. “We played a very difficult schedule playing several top 10-top 15 opponents. The Ivy League is extremely competitive. Our team continued to improve throughout the season and I am so proud of how the team competed and came together as a group. Obviously the Yale game was a highlight and all 28 players contributed to that win!”
Wills identified an inability to sustain performance as her team’s biggest weakness.
“Moving forward I want us to compete consistently so that we are able to put together a full 60 minutes,” she said.
She’ll have a committed group ready to take on that challenge next spring. But there are three players Wills won’t be able to rely on in 2020: her trio of senior captains, who said farewell to the program on Saturday after starting each of the team’s 15 games this year. MacAfee, attacker Nicole Baiocco, and defender Marley Jenkins all played very well in their last run with the Crimson.
“This season definitely was not easy,” MacAfee said, “but it was probably my favorite year of playing Harvard lacrosse. A lot of games did not go our way, but our coaches took pride in making our team a family and they never gave up on us no matter the circumstances. They made this year very special for me and I’m really thankful I got even one year to play for them.”
She highlighted the Yale game as a high point of the season.
“It was a great team win,” she said. “Of course, Harvard-Yale is always a big game. It was awesome to beat them decisively at home.”
Jenkins agreed.
“The highlight for me was crushing Yale at home on a beautiful day,” she said. “A ton of different people scored and everyone played together and of course it’s always awesome to beat our rival Yale.”
The captains also praised their team’s ability to stick together and expressed hope for the future.
“Our biggest strength was our team culture,” said Jenkins. “We are all best friends and really care for each other’s successes, which always helps us get through hard times.”
“Regardless of the outcomes in games, we came ready to move on and get better the next day at practice,” echoed MacAfee.
“Overall it was a great season with an awesome group of girls and coaches,” said Jenkins. “I can’t wait to see where Harvard women’s lacrosse goes in the future.”
While it will certainly miss its graduating seniors, the Crimson is poised to bounce back in 2020 with a skilled coach, a new batch of recruits, and a cohesive returning cast.

Now that you have reached the end of the semester, it’s time for a well-deserved break. Just kidding — it’s actually a great time to think about your future. As the semester draws to a close, you can start planning for how to maintain connections with your professors. A professor that you click with can be a great future advisor, mentor, or recommender, and on their end, it’s always nice to know that a student appreciated their course. Here are a few ways to forge that meaningful connection.
Email Your Professor a Thank You
At the end of the semester, it’s important to make yourself stand out and create an impression — just being an attentive listener in class will not suffice. Email your professor to tell them how much you enjoyed the class, and be sure to make the email specific and individualized (in other words, this is not the time to create a reusable email template). Even if you don’t get a response, they, or at least the person who schedules their meetings, has seen your name now.
Go to Office Hours (The Last Ones at Least)
Most professors’ office hours are sparsely attended throughout the semester, emptying out dramatically when there are no assignments left. Attend one of their last office hours to let them know how their class educated you and changed how you thought about the world. A little flattery never hurt anyone.
Stop By Their Office Next Year
While this isn’t one you can accomplish right now with your current professors, it is something you can do with past professors. Stop by, or schedule an appointment if that’s how they roll, to update them on your endeavors and tell them how much you miss their class.
Doing any (or all) of these things can set you up for a successful relationship with your professor in the future. When trying to find a letter of recommendation, a thesis advisor, or just a reference for your resume, these connections will be immensely helpful. Going that little extra distance can dramatically impact how people view you and the connections you forge.
