After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the evening of April 30, Elizabeth Alexander—the 2009 inaugural poet, Pulitzer Prize finalist, and Yale professor—spoke at the Cambridge Public Library in an event sponsored by the Harvard Book Store. Alexander read from her latest work—a memoir titled “The Light of the World” about the passing of her late husband, the painter Ficre Ghebreyesus—and answered audience questions. Before the event began, she sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss her work.
THC: Why did you make the choice to write your recent memoir in prose instead of poetry?
EA: I didn’t really set out to write a memoir at all. I wrote it the same way that I always write poetry—which is to say word by word, sound by sound, image by image. Eventually, as that built up, I saw that what I had was not discrete poems but rather something that, while in distilled short bits, wanted to be longer.
THC: Do you feel that there are differences between what prose can do and what poetry can do?
EA: Poetry is always aspiring to the condition of music.… It needs to be [a] song that emanates from the body in some kind of way.… I hope that what I’ve written is something like a poet’s prose, which is to say it has those same concerns, but it has more of the kind of story and storytelling that we are accustomed to in either fiction or in narrative nonfiction.
THC: You move forward and backward in time and consider the same events from different angles in your memoir. Why is that?
EA: I think that time is never strictly linear. We have memory that intrudes, all the time.… I thought to write something that combined both the forward movement and propulsion of telling an urgent story…but that also was true to the way sensation and memory always make their way in and interrupt that kind of forward march.
THC: There were many references to other literary works in your memoir. How did you choose to integrate these allusions into the text, and what effect do you feel [they have]?
EA: That’s who I am! I am a poet and a literature professor, and I’ve done it for 30 years. So it would be strange for that not to be in something that I wrote.… There are also art forms in the book. There’s poetry, painting, music. I think that there’s an enactment of a life with art.… Making art was my way of moving through grief.… I continually engage with various art forms in the book because that’s how I know that I’m alive, and that’s what I care to live on.
THC: Why was your book mostly written in very short chapters?
EA: I write in concentration, in distillation.… I think that also because what I was writing about had a certain sort of intensity...that sometimes, perhaps, there was too much to bear. So if a reader could stop, in between these little chapters, and sort of catch her breath—there’s probably that idea in there as well.
THC: When you were setting out to write your memoir, did you have the idea of the four sections that it is organized into ahead of time?
EA: No, it was very organic…. No plan at first. Just writing to know that I was still on this earth, really, honestly. As I wrote more and more and more of these little snippets, I began to see that they were adding up to something. It was only after there was a large pile that the shaping began to emerge.
THC: What is it like to publish this memoir, putting out this intensely personal document?
EA: Poems are made from the self. Poems are true in some kind of way. But certainly this, the first-person, is the real me. The children are the actual children. Though it is obviously very carefully made—there’s no artifice to hide behind. So I think it's very interesting, actually, sharing and meeting other people with their stories in a quite more direct way than often happens with poems.

"Socially liberal, fiscally conservative."
This explanation of one’s political convictions is so often heard on Harvard’s campus that it has begun to lose meaning, when in fact, its meaning matters greatly. Raised in an era of moderate Democrats, extreme Republicans, and Greg Mankiw, many see government spending as something to be extremely wary of. But while large deficits are certainly dangerous and austerity has its merits, this statement of belief rests on a false dichotomy that offers refuge from the full implications of fiscal conservatism.
The term “socially liberal” indicates that someone is pro-choice and pro-gay marriage; “fiscally conservative”, on the other hand, indicates an unwillingness to spend public money. (While fiscal conservatism may have once meant that tax revenues and expenditures should be in balance, that meaning has since changed; in today's parlance, it indicates opposition to tax or revenue increases.) By declaring oneself a combination of the two, a person is attempting to both claim the moral high ground and demonstrate political savvy. It's a statement that tries to reconcile do-gooder inclinations and the economic theory learned in an intro class.
Unfortunately, this claim of fiscal conservatism fails to acknowledge the accompanying social implications. To be fiscally conservative implies support of limited government spending on welfare, healthcare, social security, and other necessary human services.
Thus the “socially liberal, fiscally conservative” catchphrase indicates commitment to liberalism only when it does not cost money. It is easy and convenient to support changing laws that don’t require funding—sure, let gay people get married; let women have the right to an abortion.
But what about women’s access to paid-for daycare and maternity leave? What about healthcare for the poor, housing for the homeless, treatment programs for addicts, and access to good public education for every child? The idea that these policies are fiscal rather than social is absurd. Supporting them while claiming “fiscal conservatism” is also absurd. The truth is that social justice requires funding. Government investment matters. Society should spend—intelligently—a lot of government money.
For a more extreme example, look abroad. In India, where I spent last semester, the government is thoroughly underfunded, and the money they do spend is frequently lost to corruption. Their roads are extremely unsafe, schools are completely overrun, and the healthcare system leaves all but the richest with almost no services. The water that flows through the taps carries cholera and other pathogens. India desperately needs smart government investment, and they needed it yesterday; India needs safe sewage disposal systems, housing for the millions that live in makeshift shacks or on the streets of Delhi, school systems that effectively prepares students for the modern world, and so much more.
All of these social interventions—reforms and programs that could change millions of lives for the better—will cost a lot of money. But it's money worth spending; Vice President Hubert Humphrey famously said, “The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.”
Humphrey’s diagnostic is a good one. So before blithely claiming "fiscal conservatism" as a virtue, consider accepting responsibility for a true social liberalism—liberalism that includes everyone: The needs of poor working moms, disabled people, the elderly, and the mentally ill. You might even support raising taxes. It could keep you from owning a second boat, but you'll support policies that will yield a rising tide. Be fiscally liberal.

A federal judge sentenced Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev to death on Wednesday for his role in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and left hundreds wounded.
Tsarnaev spoke in court for the first time since he entered a “not guilty” plea at his arraignment hearing two years ago, expressing remorse for his actions, according to an official court hearing transcription. He also spoke about his faith in God and asked for mercy for himself and his brother Tamerlan, who died in April 2013 following a shootout in Watertown, Mass., after the bombings. 
“I’m sorry for the lives that I’ve taken, the suffering that I’ve caused, and the damage that I’ve done, irreparable damage,” said Tsarnaev, who once lived in Cambridge and worked as a lifeguard at a Harvard pool.
Tsarnaev’s trial began in March, and after his lawyers openly acknowledged his guilt, a federal jury returned guilty verdicts on all 30 charges in connection to the Marathon bombings in April. A month later, the jury recommended that Tsarnaev be sentenced to death. U.S. District Court Judge George A. O’Toole formalized that recommendation at Wednesday’s hearing.
The sentencing comes just more than two years after Tsarnaev and his brother set off two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon race on April 15, 2013. Days later, police cars raced in pursuit of the brothers across the streets of Cambridge, eventually leading to the shootout that left Tsarnaev’s brother dead. Tsarnaev was eventually captured in Watertown on April 19, but not before a manhunt left much of the Boston area, including Harvard, on lockdown.
Tsarnaev will soon be taken to federal death row, likely in Terre Haute, Ind.

Former Harvard basketball standout Wesley Saunders will get his chance to play his way onto an NBA roster. According to reports from RealGM and SBNation, Saunders will play in the NBA Summer League next month as a member of the Utah Jazz.
Saunders, a three-time All-Ivy League first-teamer and the 2013-2014 Ivy League Player of the Year, was ranked 68th in the rising NBA draft class according to ESPN’s Chad Ford. But Saunders was not among the 60 prospects selected by NBA teams at Thursday’s draft.
According to an interview he gave to Hoops Rumors, Saunders scheduled workouts with the 76ers, Hawks, Clippers, Bulls, Knicks, Bucks, Magic, and Mavericks in the weeks leading up to the draft.
The Jazz were not mentioned, but Saunders will suit up for Salt Lake City in just a matter of weeks nonetheless. Utah will play six games this summer in addition to a tournament at the end of the short season.
The 6’5” wing averaged 16.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game in his senior season, carrying the Crimson to its fourth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. In his final taste of tournament action, Saunders recorded 26 points and five assists, nearly willing Harvard to an upset over heavily favored North Carolina.
Now as he shifts his attention towards the professional ranks, Saunders has an opportunity very similar to the one that another Crimson basketball standout took advantage of in 2010.
After going undrafted, Jeremy Lin ’10 received an invite to play in the Summer League from the Dallas Mavericks. Then after averaging 9.8 points and 18.6 minutes over four games, Lin earned the attention of the Golden State Warriors, who signed the guard to a deal at the end of July.
All 30 NBA teams will have the opportunity to sign the wing at the conclusion of the summer league. Saunders will get his first chance to make his case on July 6 against the Boston Celtics.

"Orange is the New Black" fans rejoiced on June 11 around 9 p.m., when the third season of the cult Netflix original series was released early for streaming. It has been a year since the show’s second season was released in similar Netflix episode-dump fashion in 2014. Fans remember the second season fondly, especially the tyrannical antics of Vee and her demise during the season finale. Expectations for this summer were high, but a lackluster season with a hard-to-get-through first few episodes has been enough to send some Harvard fans back into the depths of their dismal Cambridge winter selves (read: us).
The Good: Ruby Rose as Stella Carlin. Stella provides a much needed breath of fresh air in the stale “Piper has an unfair life and shouldn’t be here” narrative of Litchfield. She is straightforward and blunt, saying what we all wish we had the courage to say to those classmates in the dining hall and Ec 10 section we really hate.
The Bad: Piper Chapman. The swai of Litchfield. For a show that stirs sympathy for almost every character, it is amazing how insufferable Piper is. We scratched our brains, but there is hardly a single moment this season that we have any warm feelings toward her. Even when [spoiler alert] she gets outfoxed by her business partner, the viewer feels satisfied that she finally gets a taste of her own medicine and her status is checked within the prison hierarchy. We can only hope that Piper’s time is running out. Swai on the other hand… see you in September.
The Meh: Flashbacks. Season 3 features a series of backstories on various Litchfield inmates who have played roles in the series up to this point but have never had their chances to shine. This had the potential to be an incredible addition to the show, but fell flat in some episodes. While there are praiseworthy standouts including the story of Pennsatucky’s experience dealing with sexual assault, there are episodes in which the flashbacks feel less tied to the characters’ experiences in prison. Granted, we are biased. We go to Harvard, so we experience flashbacks on a daily basis: just take a walk through Winthrop House and you will be immersed into rich, untouched, unrenovated, crumbling history.
Though season 3 did not live up to expectations, we still binged this season with the same gusto we binged Stat 104 lecture videos. Our optimism is high for season 4, out summer 2016. Let’s hope the writers and producers learn from their shortcomings this time around and deliver the best season Orange has seen.
Grade: B (a.k.a. Harvard F)
