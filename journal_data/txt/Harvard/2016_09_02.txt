After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an increasingly polarized and sound-byte-driven America, little is rarer than serious investigations of complex issues. Thankfully, Anna Deavere Smith’s latest play “Notes from the Field: Doing Time in Education,” running through Sept. 17 at the American Repertory Theater, presents an alternative to the talking heads of cable and newsfeed clips of John Oliver. Composed (like several of Smith’s earlier plays) of verbatim passages from interviews Smith has conducted, “Notes from the Field" presents a startling range of perspectives from within the nation's schools, prisons, and communities—a feat all the more impressive considering that Smith plays every character. In “Notes from the Field,” Smith has created a stunningly nuanced, inventive, and emotionally resonant investigation of how the country values the lives of young people of color.
“Notes from the Field” is ostensibly about the “school-to-prison pipeline,” defined in the extensive program notes as “the punitive and discriminatory school disciplinary practices that drive children into the juvenile and criminal justice systems.” (Actually, the play focuses enough on surrounding issues like police brutality, economic despair, and the history of the civil rights movement that the title might be misleadingly specific.) In the first act, such wide-ranging characters as former inmates, school administrators, pastors, and psychiatrists come to life in five- to ten-minute monologues. Each suite is named after one of its more memorable lines: In a scene called “Best Buy,” Kevin Moore, the videographer of the violent arrest of Freddie Gray, describes how members of Black Lives Matter took him to the electronics store to “arm” him with cameras. Particular highlights include “Breaking the Box,” taken from Dr. Jamal-Harrison Bryant’s eulogy of Gray, and “The Shakara Story,” the Act One closer, in which Niya Kenny describes why she filmed a police officer throwing her classmate from her desk. “How can you mind your business?” she asks in the final line before the lights dim. “That seems like something you should make your business.”
Smith, ever the virtuoso, fully inhabits each character. With director Leonard Foglia, dialect coach Amy Stoller, and movement coach Michael Leon Thomas, she captures their mannerisms, personalities, and passions, displaying tremendous range. More importantly, she visibly shares their earnestness and pain as relates to the material. Smith’s skills as an actress are matched only by her skills as a documentarian: She has drawn an astonishingly raw and expressive script from her interviews. Because she portrays every character with compassion, even those with seemingly opposing perspectives, her snapshot of racial inequality in America develops with uncommon detail and subtlety.
Smith performs on an elegant, surprisingly flexible set designed by Riccardo Hernandez. White vertical panels descend from the ceiling, five midstage and five upstage, functioning as projection screens and curtains. Projections, designed by Elaine McCarthy, include news montages and statistics between the monologues to add context, as well as scenic backgrounds and occasionally live closeups of Smith during the speeches. By serving as interludes, they also ingeniously allow Smith to seamlessly change costumes. The effect is an immersive hour-plus of relentless, emotionally charged theater without a dull moment. And that’s just Act One.
It’s a lot to absorb. Probably with that in mind, Act Two takes a bold risk. After a brief intermission, the audience is divided into groups of roughly a dozen and sent to various corners of the Loeb Drama Center. The ensuing facilitated discussion comprises Act Two. Experiences will doubtlessly vary, but The Crimson’s group included a surprising diversity of backgrounds and responses to the show (although none were all that out of place in the People’s Republic of Cambridge): “Notes” clearly creates a variety of associations for lifelong Bostonians, Harvard students, teachers in the metro area, and other theater patrons. While it doesn’t match the intensity of the first act, the discussion serves as a useful tool in processing and reckoning with the sprawling social problems raised in Act One. The play ends with a 25-minute “coda” of three more monologues, which widen the play’s lens for a dramatic, forward-looking conclusion. The play’s run time—nearly three hours, highly unusual for what is basically a one-woman play, plus pages of further commentary in the program from Smith and dramaturg Alisa Solomon—reveals Smith’s eagerness to examine the issues in their full context and complexity.
“Notes from the Field” certainly offers no easy solutions, but it does offer hope. The coda culminates in Smith’s exceptionally powerful performance as John Lewis speaking on healing and fraternity, echoing a recurring theme that addressing monumental challenges requires individual commitments to justice on a national scale. The play is not only a great work of theater but, in its empathy, curiosity, and comfort in complexity, a significant addition to the national discourse.

When you belong to two places, traveling between them becomes a matter of return, a perpetual process of coming back to one home or the other. The fundamental dichotomy is between these two sides of the ocean: here and there. You are always here, relatively speaking, but for the definition of yourself to be complete, it must also include your connection to there. Your heart must be wide enough to hold both countries simultaneously—linked but distinct—constantly stretching to contain the vast expanse of salt water between them.
The first time I crossed the ocean, I was three months old: made in America with Croatian parts, as someone put it—which is sort of silly but true. For three months, my cells had been multiplying exclusively with the aid of American air and American water, but when I arrived in Croatia, I like to think that my metaphorical blood recognized the country that had sourced it.
Location and corporality are more transient than my intangible sense of self. When I return, I slough off my there skin and replace it with my here skin; I swap one tongue for another—but on the inside, my here-ness and there-ness are buzzing beneath my breastbone, still inexorably intertwined no matter the context, no matter the time zone. This is who I am and what I cannot change: two equal discrete parts that make one unhyphenated whole.
Being in Croatia is not quite a perfect fit; as it happens, I spend most of the year living elsewhere. (T)here, I am home, but I am also out of step: the fashion is just a little different, I don’t know the right slang, and new cafes have opened where I remember there being bookstores. There’s too much cigarette smoke—I must relearn how to breathe. And yet, when I’ve been away for too long, I am astounded by the ache of absence, the visceral need to be there and not here—my sudden inability to breathe the clear American air that’s so familiar to me. (T)here, I am home, but I spend my time with people who cannot fully understand my duality. America is comfortable because I’ve grown up with it, but, as it happens, America is not at the symbolic heart of me. In other words, being in America is not quite a perfect fit, either.
Home is the soil that nurtures your roots. It’s familiar like your own handwriting, easy like breathing, comfortable like water that’s the temperature of blood.
Home is where the heart is.
Your heart is in your body, and your body is on Earth. When you live in one place, the laws of time and space do not permit you to live in another place at the same time. By being born and growing up here, you necessarily lose the opportunity to be born and grow up there. Knowing what you have forfeited, you might suffer a sense of impermanence, instability, or uncertainty. Sometimes, it may even seem tragic that you are split between two homes—but more often than not, you tend to view it as an extraordinary gift.
I have been gifted with two countries, two cultures, two languages, and, most importantly, two perspectives. The ocean is both a barrier and a bridge. My assimilation is imperfect and effortful, but if it were not like this, then I would not be who I am. Regardless of my mutable location, I define myself by the things to which I am attached: two countries, their people (who are my people), the ocean between them, an overwhelming sense of belonging when the plane lands (t)here, and, above it all, the perpetual journey from here to there and back again. 
It is said that we are all travelers, tirelessly coming and going, losing pieces of our hearts whenever we fall in love with a new landscape or a new city. Instead, I think it’s the opposite: whenever we fall in love with a new landscape or a new city, we tuck it away inside of us, collecting and keeping, carrying hearts that grow ever heavier. With all of these journeys across the ocean, I wish I could say that I’ve mastered the art of traveling light, but my heart is always full of love for both of my countries. I bring my transatlantic identity with me everywhere I go.
Maybe what matters most is the place to which you return. I, for one, am always traveling home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m not from here. I grew up in the South. I went to a 1,500 person public high school just outside of Pensacola, Fla. For reference, Pensacola is about 10 minutes from the Florida-Alabama border, and nearly everyone has the “Florida Panhandle” accent. Needless to say, Cambridge is different.
Living in the middle of the Bible Belt, I was one of the few non-Christian kids at my school, and I was by far the most liberal. To put that in context, there was a 10,000 person Donald Trump rally in my hometown, while the Bernie Sanders rally wouldn't have filled Sanders Theater. So from the time politics became of relative importance to my peers, I was a pariah. In some class each day, what would start as a calm conversation between another kid and me about politics or religion would end with ten other kids in the class belittling me for my opinions.
It didn’t really help matters that I would seek out these confrontations, and it didn’t help that I was on the football team, possibly the most conservative group on campus. Regardless, when I was accepted by Harvard, I was more than happy to leave behind my conservative roots and start fresh among people who ostensibly shared my ideals.
I was warned about the change in climate. And I was told that the people in the North are a little colder, too—the whole “Southern hospitality” thing.
But I didn’t care about those warnings, because I was finally going to be around like-minded people.
After I moved into my dorm and settled in, I was taken aback: At Harvard, I learned, people are very outspoken and very easily offended. But while this definitely surprised me, I wasn't bothered by it, because students were expressing opinions with which I at least marginally agreed. Even when my personal opinions were more complicated—like with the controversy at Yale last Halloween—as a white male, I didn't want to speak out of turn. I held the same philosophy towards conversations about final clubs.
So for a while, I carried along in ambivalent naivety. People here were Democrats and that was enough. But after months of this, it hit me: Harvard is just as politically polarized as the Deep South. Obviously, in the opposite direction, but polarized nonetheless.
What's different is that no one here seems to understand just how polarized they are. Sure, Harvard students are remarkably more knowledgeable about political issues than my friends from back home. And there are definitely exceptions to the rule. But for some reason, the inclusivity that everyone preaches only applies to those who hold a certain political ideology. Someone like myself—a Democrat and a liberal—becomes the subject of ridicule or exclusion when they don’t staunchly support the most left-wing views. Even my teammates, some of the people on campus to whom I feel closest, frequently make fun of my “conservative” or “politically incorrect” beliefs, because I am not as far left as they are.
I come from a place where I was excluded for my political beliefs. I was never taken seriously. I was told by my grandparents, close friends, teachers, and role models that my beliefs were invalid. I ventured nearly 2,000 miles away from my hometown to escape the exclusion and intolerance of different-minded people. Yet, even amongst some of the most intelligent people in the world, this attitude persisted behind the mask of acceptance.

When Institute of Politics Director Maggie Williams decided to take a temporary leave of absence last month to join Hillary Clinton’s transition team, some conservative alumni went up in arms. In a letter published in The Crimson and addressed to Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, 15 University alumni called for Williams’ “immediate resignation,” condemning her political appointment as being a “conflict of interest” with the nonpartisan nature of the IOP.
Williams’ appointment to the Clinton campaign was never truly unexpected or unprecedented: Williams has been a consistent and long-time supporter of the Clintons, working with them since the 1992 election. Even before she was brought in as the IOP Director, she had served as Clinton’s campaign manager in the 2008 election, as her transition director in 1992, and as the Chief of Staff to the First Lady.
We reject the letter’s argument that the leadership of the IOP must not be involved in partisan politics. Maggie Williams has every right to actively support any political cause, and it is especially in her role as IOP Director that she is entitled to—and actively encouraged to—engage in political expression. The IOP's commitment to nonpartisanship does not necessitate the political noninvolvement of its director, and conversely its director’s political beliefs do not taint the IOP’s neutrality.
This principle is borne out by multiple precedents; the IOP has always been led by figures with significant partisan political experience. Williams’ predecessor, C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, was a prominent Republican and served as Kentucky’s Secretary of State, and his own predecessor, interim IOP Director John Culver ’54, was a Democratic Senator from Iowa.
More saliently, even conservatives within the IOP have rushed to Williams’ defense. Douglas R. Heye, a Fall 2015 IOP resident fellow and 25-year veteran of Republican politics, has personally attested to Williams’ “unyielding dedication to ensuring conservative voices are represented at the IOP." This insider testimony makes clear that any fears of Williams’ partisanship are all but unwarranted.
If anything, the benefits of Williams’ involvement in presidential politics will redound to the IOP. Professors at Harvard take time off all the time to engage in research or serve in presidential administrations, and doing so furthers knowledge in their field. Professors return with new material and ideas, and few would disagree that these leaves of absence are important and essential for development in academia.
Similarly, Williams’ decision to join an active presidential transition team may strengthen rather than hamstring the IOP, as she will return with greater first-hand experience in the national political process, in addition to stronger connections o the political elite.

Dear Editors,
You put me in the rather difficult position of defending the Nazis, but such is my commitment to freedom of speech that I shall do so.
In your editorial “Safe Spaces and Free Speech,” you predicated that “[t]here is a crucial distinction to be drawn between free speech and hate speech,” thereby demonstrating your formidable talent for paradox. If ignorant, offensive comments are not protected by the freedom of speech, then that freedom is nothing but an insulting farce. I do not enjoy being derogated, but I sold my torch and pitchfork to help pay for textbooks and therefore have been unable to persecute offenders.
“In the vast majority of cases, speech or assembly ought to be sacred,” you wrote. It happens that sacredness does not work quite that way. Either one supports absolute freedom of speech or one supports censorship; the two are incompossible. This is true even when the censors believe they are acting for the benefit of their community. A peaceful march is a peaceful march, regardless of whether the marchers are Nazis or girl scouts.  What you call a university’s responsibility to its members quickly and alarmingly becomes a direct abrogation of the free debate for which President Faust advocated so strongly at Convocation.
This issue can be summarized by our old friend Thomas Jefferson: “Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.” Racial and sexual harassment are the results of ideas; if we are to eliminate them, we must spend more time arguing tolerance in the open forum and less time browbeating people with capricious restrictions of their fundamental rights.

To the editor:
Your editorial this morning missed the point, just as Maggie Williams did and the Clintons do regularly. Of course she has a right to work in political campaigns, and of course directors of the IOP usually had extensive political experience. But appearances matter, too, as Hillary Clinton proved to her detriment by failing to set clear boundaries between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Similarly, Ms. Williams' decision to take a leave of absence  demonstrates that she does not understand how, in the midst of an intensely partisan campaign, she has damaged the reputation of the IOP for partisan balance. She has put her personal political interests before the interests of the Institute. She should resign.

Harvard’s Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—will change the way it elects its members in the coming years, replacing traditional paper ballots with an online voting system and requiring more signatures for petition candidates.
Historically, University alumni have elected Overseers—who serve six-year terms and advise the University president—through paper ballots that Harvard sent them in the mail.
The new voting process will allow Harvard’s many alumni to vote for the body—as well as for members of the Harvard Alumni Association board of directors—on a secure online system, which will likely launch by the 2018-19 school year, the University announced Thursday. Turnout for the Overseers election is traditionally low: 35,870 ballots were cast in last year’s election, a fraction of the estimated 265,000 Harvard degree holders eligible to vote.
“We’re pleased to move to online voting, which alumni around the world have asked us to adopt,” Kenji Yoshino ’91, the president of the Board of Overseers, wrote in a statement. “We will make this change as soon as we can put a secure and reliable system in place.”
Harvard will also increase more than tenfold the number of signatures required to qualify as a petition candidate, going from 201 signatures to one percent of the eligible voting population, or around 2,650 signatures. However, aspiring petition candidates will be able to gather those signatures by generating a petition online instead of obtaining official watermarked forms from the University.
Harvard will also mandate that Overseers hold degrees from the University; previously, anyone could run for the board.
The changes come after one particularly controversial set of petition candidates. Earlier this year, an outsider slate of five alumni took a controversial and ultimately unsuccessful shot at the Board of Overseers via petition, drawing national headlines by pushing a two-pronged platform: to eliminate undergraduate tuition and scrutinize affirmative action as antithetical to diversity.
Ron K. Unz ’83, the conservative intellectual who mounted the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” slate of petition candidates, said he was not surprised that Harvard made the changes to the Overseers election process.
“From the beginning I expected this effort to be a one-off effort that would either succeed or fail, and if it failed that Harvard would take steps to ensure something like this did not happen again in the future,” Unz said. University President Drew G. Faust repeatedly denounced both the free tuition and admissions proposals.
“The past year’s election process brought various election issues into sharper focus, including what many people regarded as a surprisingly low number of signatures needed to qualify for the ballot by petition, and what some have regarded as unduly cumbersome methods for supporting petition candidates or casting votes,” Harvard spokesperson David J. Cameron wrote in an email.
Unz acknowledged that many of the changes to the voting system made “perfect sense.”
“It’s not surprising that given the number of overseas Harvard alumni that they would switch to an electronic system,” Unz said. But for petition candidates like Unz, these changes might come at a cost.
“Given the combinations of these two changes it’s clear that our campaign was the last possible campaign along the lines of what we organized,” Unz said.

Harvard Law professors rank highest nationwide in the judicial impact of their legal scholarship, according to a new study examining citations of law review articles by U.S. high courts, but no women scholars across the country placed in the top 25.
The study ranked the top 25 law professors according to the number of judicial citations their scholarly works receive, and Harvard Law School professors Richard H. Fallon, Cass R. Sunstein ’75, and John F. Manning ’82 claimed the top three spots.
The impetus for the study, its authors at the University of St. Thomas Law School said, was recent dialogue in legal circles questioning the value of legal writing and its applicability to the real world. In 2011, Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts declared legal scholarship “largely of no use or interest to people who actually practice law.”
While judicial citation rates are generally low, the study—which looked at citations by the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Court of Appeals, and state high courts—concluded that “a certain subset of scholars are both noticed and cited by the judiciary as well as their peers.”
That the most-cited legal scholars hail from Harvard is unsurprising, according to Valerie Aggerbeck, one of the authors of the study.
“When you are citing in a judicial opinion, you want to rely on the strongest authority that you possibly can, and when there isn’t precedent in the case law you can rely on, you’re going to want to choose an author with credibility,” Aggerbeck said. “Harvard Law Review is an excellent law review, and Harvard Law School professors are considered experts in their fields.”
Fallon described the challenge law professors face in trying to bridge two groups—“practicing lawyers and judges” and “more theoretically minded professors and students”—whose interests often diverge. “I would like to think that we at Harvard Law School do a good job at keeping a foot successfully in both camps.”
But according to the metric used in the University of St. Thomas study, men—at Harvard and across the country—influence the judiciary to a far greater extent than their female colleagues. Women law professors were entirely absent from the rankings.
The world of legal scholarship has long drawn criticism for gender inequality. Women comprised 22 percent of tenured Law School faculty in the 2015-2016 academic year, according to data from the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity, and Harvard Law Review has struggled historically to achieve gender parity in its membership.
In an email, Fallon called the underrepresentation of women “clearly part of a larger, disappointing, regrettable pattern”—one that is changing more slowly than he had expected.
The study’s authors offered up theories in an interview to explain the discrepancy. University of St. Thomas research librarian Nick Farris attributed the absence of women from judicial citations to a time lag—many of the top scholars began publishing their work several decades ago, when law school faculties were heavily male-dominated.
Aggerbeck hypothesized that the gender gap will close over time, as women continue to enter these fields and gain notoriety.
Manning, who wrote in an email that he believes that judicial citations are not the most meaningful measure of scholarly impact, thinks that women should already rank higher.
“By any reasonable measure of quality of legal scholarship (which citation counts capture only very imperfectly), there are certainly women who belong in the top 25,” he wrote.

Urging listeners to confront both the “beautiful” and “painful” moments of American history, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Jonathan L. Walton voiced his support for San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has recently drawn criticism for sitting during the national anthem in protest of police brutality.
Walton argued that Kaepernick’s critics espoused “affectatious claims of patriotism” rather than genuine, informed citizenship, and called upon the audience to engage fully with injustices. Kaepernick’s moral scrutiny of the police system, Walton contended, represented a more true form of patriotism.
“The true lover of this country is willing to rebuke the nation when it’s wrong and do all in its power to make it right, not by ignoring or excusing its sins, but by bringing the nation’s sins out in the open,” he said.
Some critics have called Kaepernick “anti-American” for his decision to sit through the national anthem, and characterized his protest as an act of disrespect to the armed forces. While Kaepernick has said he has “grave respect” for those who serve, he remains steadfast in his protest.
"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick said in an interview with NFL Media last week.
At Thursday’s Morning Prayers  in Holden Chapel, Walton, a son and grandson of military veterans, began his remarks by expressing his respect and admiration for those who serve in the military.
“Every time I look upon the walls of Memorial Church, I am inspired by the 1,113 names engraved upon its walls, men and women who paid the ultimate price in World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam,” he said.
Walton echoed the sentiment expressed by University President Drew G. Faust in her remarks at Morning Prayers on Wednesday, turning to America’s “complicated” history to discuss both “inspirational moments” and “unjust realities.” He discussed the military service of Navy doctor Robert S. Hurlbut ’34, who died in World War II and was remembered for providing “necessary words of comfort” to those who served with him.
Walton contrasted this narrative of selflessness and heroism with the story of Emmett Till, a black teenager who was kidnapped, beaten, and lynched in 1955 for allegedly flirting with a white woman. Till’s killers were acquitted and were paid to share details of his murder for publication in a magazine.
“This is who we are as a nation—we are an exhibit of contradictions,” Walton said. “While it is easy and comforting to smooth over these contradictions, it’s also dangerous.”

Nearly 1,400 undergraduates registered to vote or requested absentee ballots as part of the College's mandatory online check-in, via TurboVote voter registration software.
Students could either register to vote for the first time or request absentee ballots from Aug. 15 to Aug. 30, the period of time when check-in—an online process conducted by Harvard where students are required to verify information about themselves for the upcoming semester—was open.
The TurboVote software was added to the process by a collaboration between the Institute of Politics and the Registrar’s Office.
IOP administrators and Austin E. Sowa ’17, the vice president of the IOP’s Student Advisory Council who provided the registration figures, worked with representatives from Oracle, which develops Harvard’s check-in software; TurboVote; and the Registrar’s Office to implement the project. This is the first time the College has integrated voter registration into student check-ins, though the IOP has used TurboVote for the last five years.
“The goal of this project was to develop a model that could be replicated at universities across the country. The IOP actually has a program called the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement,” Sowa said. “We’re hoping that some of these schools we work with... might want to replicate this on some of their campuses.”
In addition to creating the new voter registration platform, the IOP released a video explaining the TurboVote process to support students registering for the first time.
The IOP has a long history of encouraging voting through its Community Action Committee, which works towards registering as many Harvard students as possible.
In a June press release, then-IOP Executive Director Cathy A. McLaughlin said she “would call upon other colleges and universities to join us in finding ways to encourage students to engage in the political process.”
TurboVote is run by Democracy Works, a company founded by Kennedy School alumni Seth E. Flaxman and Kathryn E. Peters. Oracle provides the PeopleSoft Campus Solutions software that students use to check in every semester.

Members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers will meet with University officials within the next 10 days—their first meeting since the National Labor Relations Board’s recent ruling on graduate student unionization.
Last month, the NLRB overturned precedent to classify graduate and undergraduate teaching fellows and research assistants as employees with collective bargaining rights, a ruling that requires Harvard to legally recognize an elected graduate student union. The change in labor law moves the issue of unionization into the hands of Harvard’s central administration, rather than the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where activists have been pushing for unionization over the past year.
Director of Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran invited the HGSU-UAW spokesperson to a meeting last week, according to GSAS dean for administration and finance Allen Aloise.
“Because now we’re in a labor and employment issue potentially, the Labor and Employee Relations Office has the lead, like they do with all union negotiations at Harvard,” Aloise said.
Aloise said that he will be attending the upcoming meeting, given the issue’s connection to GSAS and his involvement.
“The intention is to open a channel for dialogue, get to know each other, talk a little bit about what the next steps might be with respect to unionization for students on campus,” Aloise added.
Members of the HGSU-UAW said they are also eager for the discussion with administrators.
“We look forward to talking with the administration about having a free and fair union election, absent of influence from our employer,” HGSU-UAW spokesperson and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis wrote in an email.
An election, in which employees will vote whether to authorize the HGSU-UAW as their union, is on the horizon. The group has repeatedly called for Harvard to remain neutral as the election process moves forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Divinity School is celebrating its bicentennial this year with a series of events, beginning with the Faces of Divinity exhibit that launched Tuesday.
Founded in 1816 as the first non-sectarian theological establishment in the United States, the Divinity School is seeking to reflect on its past and to move forward with a renewed sense of mission.
“For two centuries HDS has advanced the study of religion and empowered men and women to serve others around the world. The bicentennial will allow us to reflect on this rich history, even as we envision anew the school’s mission for the future,” Divinity School Dean of Faculty David N. Hempton said.
The opening reception of the first bicentennial event took place Tuesday alongside the launch of the Faces of Divinity exhibit, which explores how the Divinity School transformed from a nonsectarian institution to the multi-religious school it is today. Located in Andover, Divinity, and Rockefeller Halls, the exhibit contains various media including photos, paintings, and poetry.
“The exhibit we mounted throughout the school for the bicentennial peoples our halls with some of those who helped move the school in a multi-religious direction over the last 200 years,” Divinity School Senior Lecturer Ann D. Braude said.
The exhibit has also influenced current Divinity students as they continue their studies.
“The exhibit inspired me to recognize the next three years ahead of me as an opportunity to play an important role in the world,” Lisa Richmond, a first-year masters student at the Divinity School, said.
The exhibit is the first in a series of events planned throughout this academic year.
“It’s incredible to see how much has gone on over the last 200 years. I’m definitely looking forward to learning more about that, and also how what has happened before informs the possibility of what happens in the future,” Richmond said.
Future bicentennial celebrations will include lectures, guest visitors, historical exhibits, conferences, and community events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council’s newly-elected docket committee is set to consider a motion filed last spring that some professors believe could prevent College sanctions against members of single-gender social organizations from taking effect. Representatives of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, though, are mum about the motion’s potential power.
Twelve professors from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences filed the motion last May in response to a new policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, will prohibit students in unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding extracurricular leadership positions or receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes and the Marshall scholarships.
Resolving that the College “shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join,” last spring’s motion cited “recent administrative proposals” as a motivation behind seeking to limit “Harvard’s control over students’ lives.”
Two of the motion’s signatories—former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and Classics professor Richard F. Thomas—said a successful motion would strike down the policy completely, given that Harvard’s organizational statutes place the College “under the immediate charge” of FAS.
Secretary of the Faculty Susan L. Lively and FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to say whether the motion would in fact preclude the policy from taking effect.
“The legislative process needs to play itself out,” Lively wrote in a statement provided by Cowenhoven.
Still, Lewis is confident the motion is in line with the Faculty’s history of voting and enacting “rules and regulations related to Harvard College.” Although University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly endorsed Khurana’s recommendations on social life, Lewis does not believe Faust could prevent the Faculty from voting down the sanctions.
The Faculty Council’s docket committee must schedule the motion for a debate and vote of the full Faculty. Still, FAS rules of procedure all but ensure that the motion will be taken up for consideration at an upcoming Faculty meeting, at the soonest during the next such meeting on Oct. 4.
Comparative Literature professor John T. Hamilton, History professor Alison F. Johnson, and Religion professor Parimal G. Patil—the members of last year’s Docket Committee—all declined or did not respond to request for comment on the motion.
Since its release in early May, the College’s unprecedented policy has drawn criticism from students, faculty, and alumni. In addition to graduate members of single-gender groups and national representatives from Greek organizations, some prominent Harvard figures, including former University President Lawrence H. Summers, have questioned whether the sanctions represent a step too far in the College’s efforts to create a more inclusive campus. Days after the move was announced, hundreds of women marched on Harvard Yard decrying the policy as particularly unfair to women’s groups.
The policy does have its proponents. Three varsity coaches and the treasurer of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, published letters in support of the policy.
The sanctions have also found a faculty supporter in Claudine Gay, Government professor and Dean of Social Science.
“I strongly support the new policy on single-gender social organization[s], which speaks powerfully to Harvard’s commitment to building an inclusive community,” Gay wrote in an email. “This [policy] is an important step in combatting gender-based discrimination on campus, and preparing our students for the realities of the modern world.”
Critics and proponents of the final club sanctions are holding back speculation on the results of a Faculty vote at an upcoming meeting.
“I prefer not to speculate on the views of other faculty members; we will have a fuller sense of the range of opinions after the faculty have had an opportunity to discuss the policy (and the motion) later this year,” Gay wrote.
Lewis, too, was unsure how the Faculty would vote and said he has not actively lobbied his colleagues to support the motion.
“Almost everyone who has signed the motion are [professors] who got in touch with me after The Crimson printed my letter to Dean Khurana, so I don’t know how many others might be interested in supporting it, or what will happen when it comes up,” Lewis said. “It will be a good discussion regardless.”
Motion signatory and psychology professor Steven Pinker said that Khurana invited him to a “very pleasant lunch at which we discussed the issue.”
Pinker said Khurana has met with several signatories of the committee individually to discuss the sanctions. Another signatory who spoke on the condition of anonymity also met with Khurana. Both Pinker and the other signatory said they hadn’t heard of any of the other professors withdrawing their support for the motion after such a meeting.
College Spokesperson Rachael Dane did not confirm the meetings, writing in an email that Khurana does not “comment on specific meetings,” though she added that Khurana “regularly meets with his faculty colleagues to hear their perspectives and points of view on a number of issues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They are back.. The Harvard men’s soccer team is ready to open up its season with home games against Villanova (0-1) on Friday and Hofstra (1-1) on Sunday.
Last year’s Crimson season was an inconsistent one. The team finished with a 9-6-2 overall record and a 5-2 mark in Ivy play. While the team’s record was good enough for second place in the Ivy League, it was not enough to earn a NCAA Tournament bid. Despite four shutouts in its conference slate and eight players named to All-Ivy teams, including a 6-0 win against Penn to end the season, Harvard could not overcome its shaky start..
“I think this year we’re going to be a little bit more creative in the offense,” co-captain Mark Ashby said. “We have some really special midfielders. Those guys are very creative on the ball and they combine really well. I see us scoring more goals, through those combinations, through the run of play, rather than a more direct style that we played last year.”
After losing six seniors, the team is relatively young with about half of its players being freshmen and sophomores. Still, the Crimson does return the leadership of six seniors. This group includes Ashby, a defender who returns for his senior season after missing last season due to injury, Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, who was named to the 2016 All-Ivy first team and NSCAA All-East region third team, and five returning All-Ivy players.
“One of the great things about our team is that from top to bottom we are a very cohesive unit,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “We do a very good job of making all the classes feel comfortable. When you create a culture where it is expected of you to speak up and voice your opinion, it makes it easier for freshmen to come in and join that culture.”
Ashby and Wheeler-Omiunu, who also captained the 2015 team, will hope to set the tone for the season in this weekend’s two contests. In past years, Harvard has struggled in the opening games of the season. Last year, it had only one win in its first seven matches. Having the first two games of the season at home might provide the boost the team needs to start out strong.
“It’s crucial, obviously,” Ashby said. “We’ve actually struggled quite a bit in opening games and early on in the season in past years. It’s really, really important that we get off to a good start so we find these games are gonna be ones that we will regret not winning.”
This weekend will feature matches against teams that Harvard has only played once in program history.
On Friday at Ohiri Field, the team will face off against Villanova for the second time ever. The Crimson won the teams’ 2006 meeting, 3-1. The Wildcats will be looking to both avenge this loss and avoid starting off the season on the wrong foot after falling in overtime to Rider, 2-1, in its season opener.
The Crimson will have little time to prepare for its matchup with Hofstra. The Pride started off its season with a split in its first two contests, defeating Stony Brook and falling to No. 22 UNC Charlotte last week. After taking on Boston College on Friday night, Hofstra will meet Harvard in Cambridge for the first contest between the two since the Crimson shut out Hofstra, 5-0, in 1992. 24 years later, the Pride now boasts a Colonial Athletic Association co-rookie of the Week and College Soccer News National Team of the Week member among its ranks, and will be looking for its stars to step up against the Crimson.
This weekend will be the collegiate debuts of eight Harvard freshmen, adding further depth to its team. The Crimson will be relying on the octet to pick up from where last year’s seniors left off, and to make an impact to help the team achieve its goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s still early in the season, but the Harvard women’s soccer team is evidently committed to doing what it needs to do jumpstart a long and successful year.
On Thursday night, under the lights at Jordan Field for the third consecutive game, the Crimson dispatched winless Central Connecticut State, 3-0, on two goals from senior forward Midge Purce to pick up its second win of the season and move to 2-1. The slumping Blue Devils fell to 0-5, having been shut out in four of their five losses.
“We’ve tried to make improvements in every game,” coach Chris Hamblin said. “We did a good job against Army, fixing some of the things that we needed to work on after the UConn game, and today, we made some nice adjustments as well.”
Purce got Harvard out to an early lead in the 11th minute off of a corner kick, then provided insurance with a 61st minute finesse shot past CCSU senior goalie Nicki Turley.
After watching the Crimson go 0-for-24 on corner kicks over its first two games, Hamblin pointed to the team’s first goal as a sign that its efforts in practice were starting to bear fruit.
Senior forward Karly Zlatic tacked on Harvard’s third score in the 78th minute for her first goal since her freshman year. Three different Crimson players tallied assists—sophomore midfielder Zayne Matulis, senior forward Rachel Garcia, and sophomore defender/midfielder Leah Mohammadi.
Garcia’s assist was her first on the season, while for the sophomores, their assists were their first points of their Harvard careers.
“One thing that’s special about this team is that no one’s ever scared, no matter who we’re playing,” Purce said. “Fear is not really in our vocabulary. This is a great group of girls. I don’t think I’ve played with such a large pool of women who have such high soccer IQ’s.”
In a game in which the home team controlled the pace of the game and fired 18 shots at the CCSU net, the major factor, for the second consecutive game, was the Crimson’s ability to put up a near lights-out defensive performance.
The Blue Devils tallied just four shots over 90 minutes, and were not awarded a single corner kick until the 85th minute.
“Defensively, there are still some things that I want us to do better, and I think the second half was much better than the first in that regard,” Hamblin said. “So many of our tactics come from good defending, and I think that’s credit to the team, which is working hard and collectively.”
In the second half, the Harvard defense came alive, shutting down threats with an aggressive onslaught and accurate clearings. The first half performance, however, was a blemish on an otherwise solid night.
“Collectively, we were all very unhappy with the way we started the game,” Purce said. “That was the first time that we didn’t come out very hard and high-pressuring from the beginning. They pressed us really high, which was frustrating for us. I’m very proud of the way that the team handled it.”
Co-captain Lizzie Durack and sophomore Danielle Etzel split time in the net, each taking 45 minutes to record the shutout effort. The two were effective in organizing the defense and its movement and the duo only had to make three saves on the evening.
“The fact that they didn’t have a lot of action is good,” Hamblin said. “They didn’t have to make many saves, and that means that the team, from the forwards all the way down to the goalkeeper, have done their defensive job.”
Hamblin also praised Charlotte Davis for her contributions on defense. The sophomore went into the back line for her first minutes in place of junior defender Marie Becker. All told, 21 players saw action for the Crimson on Thursday night.
