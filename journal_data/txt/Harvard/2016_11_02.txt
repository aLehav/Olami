After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A haunting presence hung over Jordan Hall during the Boston Modern Orchestra Project’s first concert of the 2016-2017 season at the New England Conservatory. Throughout the final piece of the night, Steven Stucky’s inventive “Chamber Concerto”, the air felt solemn and gloomy in spite of an adrenaline-fueled conclusion. The recent memory of Stucky’s death in February was on the minds of many, lending an emotional charge to the already powerful work wonderfully performed by the small orchestra. Under the direction of conductor Gil Rose, the concert, billed as “A special tribute to Steven Stucky,” indeed provided a fitting commemoration to the contemporary American giant while also doing justice to the works of the other composers featured on the program.
After some witty and conversational remarks, Rose started off the program with Michael Colgrass’s eclectic “The Schubert Birds”, which careened between piercing screeches, dreamlike swells, and bursts of jazz. Building upon Franz Schubert’s Kupelwieser Waltz, the piece explored the variations in the 19TH-century composer’s work and provided a great opportunity for the orchestra to show off a full range of orchestral colors: From the start, the violins trilled eerily on harmonics, ingeniously imitating the sound of chirping birds. What followed was a trancelike section shaded excellently by vibraphone and crotales in the percussion. The woodwinds and timpani introduced some violent shrieks in later sections, and with such powerful interjections, the piece never lost control over the audience’s attention.
The next work, the 1952 Pulitzer-winning Symphony Concertante by Harvard alumnus Gail T. Kubik ’38, provided an invigorating and bravura display of the abilities of the three soloists: trumpeter Terry Everson, violist Jing Peng, and pianist Vivian Choi. From the angular opening melody performed in unison with the orchestra to the buoyant spirit and wonder that pervaded the last movement, the soloists, particularly the superbly expressive Peng and the colorful Everson, shone through. Despite the Coplandesque directness and sincerity of the outer movements, what ended up striking the deepest was the beautiful second movement, which featured an enchanting duet between these two performers.
Another highlight of the night was the rousing Partita in C for piano and orchestra, composed by yet another Harvard alumnus, Harold S. Shapero ’41. While Choi didn’t look completely comfortable during the Kubik, she seemed in command in this piece, with a steely virtuosity and a regality that perfectly fit the opening French overture feel. Interesting musical ideas that played with Baroque structure gave the piece some levity, with a sleazy burlesque and an arresting aria colored by vibraphone.
The concert finally culminated with Stucky’s Concerto, a dazzling display of orchestral color that built up a palpable sense of tension over its 20-minute length, starting from a simple motif between dreamy winds and ending with soaring string melodies, lively runs between soloists, and a final frenetic burst of energy. Each section of the orchestra, most making do with just two performers per instrument, brought its own flavor to the aural palette of the orchestra, from the thundering timpani to the eerie harp.
Tackling modern music, with all of its rhythmic, harmonic, and logistical complexities, can often be a daunting endeavor, but the Boston Modern Orchestra Project was more than up for the challenge. Especially for such a small group, producing such moving and immersive landscapes and doing justice to so many obscure works was an amazing feat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hate election season for a multitude of reasons, but few things irk me more than the upsurge in meaningless political “patriotism” that accompanies every presidential election. The ungodly amount of flags at political rallies; the bright stars and stripes that adorn our melodramatic presidential debates; the overwhelming hues of red, white, and blue that provide the background for every major network’s election coverage all serve to drown the public with meaningless rituals that supposedly define our love for America.
Both sides of the aisle bear equal responsibility for perpetuating the national contest of patriotism. Democrats and Republicans alike use veterans and coal miners as props to prove their alleged dedication to America’s future. Their incessant cries of “God bless our troops,” and “God bless America” serve as nothing more than a guise to cover their indifference to the affairs of the common citizen.
Unfortunately, these empty customs only represent a small portion of our nation’s mockery of meaningful political discourse. We have no one but ourselves to blame for the greater evil that continues to poison our political discussions.
Virtually every political discussion I’ve witnessed amongst friends or strangers, whether in person or online, devolves into a series of accusations. The phrases “you’re un-American,” or “you’re racist,” or “you’re weak” (along with the occasional expletive) seem to end most debates I’ve encountered. Oddly enough, I’ve never seen someone admit error or acknowledge the validity of an opponent’s point, even when forced into a logical corner. Instead, after a brief exchange of insults, both sides walk away with a smugness suggesting that they’ve won.
It seems that most of us have forgotten the point of political deliberation. Neither insults nor a condescending tone do us much good if the goal of discussion is to convince others of our stance. Sadly, most of us don’t care for convincing the opposition. Rather than attempting to prove the legitimacy of our grievances or point to the flaws of the opposition’s policy proposals, we instead engage in debate for the sole sake of looking eloquent and poised.
Don’t get me wrong: There was a time when I was obsessed with “winning” political debates. Few things proved more addicting than the sweet air of superiority I derived from crushing an opponent’s argument. However, there came a time when my brother pointed out that, despite having spent the vast majority of my life debating conservatives, I had yet to convince a single one of my claims. All I had done, he argued, was contribute to the contempt and animosity that comprise the ever-growing gap between our nation’s two parties.
In light of my brother’s words, I decided to take a step back from the front lines of debate this election season. I refrained from online political forums, ignored the “patriotic” comments of friends, and resolved to simply sit back and watch others argue instead. And in leaving the cesspool of political debate, I discovered the truth that my brother had realized long ago: Most political discussions in our country are absolutely worthless.
Following each presidential debate, I heard a multitude of students laugh off the childish nature of both candidates, failing to realize that their own debates mirrored the same political disasters they mocked. These students were quick to make snide remarks at the expense of the opposition’s average supporter, forgetting that, in doing so, they only strengthened the opposition’s disdain for contemptuous college liberals. But no matter: For a brief moment they felt smarter, and that’s what our country’s class of “intellectual” citizens values most.
For the most part, our political discourse proves just as false as the flags at Republican conventions, just as meaningless as the speeches given by Democrats to the blue collar workers they’ll continuously fail, and just as worthless as our insatiable desire to win. We’ve twisted our eagerness to champion a particular cause into an unmitigated desire to look smarter than our opponents. In doing so, we’ve not only helped to create the Trump-Clinton debacle, but we’ve also set the stage for future political gridlock that will undoubtedly come to harm our country for generations to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I were asked to describe the current status of the Reserve Officer Training Corps on Harvard’s campus in one word, I would pick  “tolerated.” One thing is for sure—I would not even consider the words “included” or “integrated.”
Therefore, I was surprised when I received an email from the UC President and Vice-President, Shaiba Rather ’17 and Danny Banks '17, describing ROTC in exactly those terms. In their September 24 email about the selection of members for the Single-Gender Social Organizations Policy Implementation Committee, they focused on Harvard’s long arc of inclusion. “In 1971,” they wrote, “amidst immense student turmoil ROTC is banned from the campus in rejection of the Vietnam War. Four and a half decades later, in 2016, Air Force ROTC returns to campus. Throughout this story, we see further and further integration and inclusion.”
In truth, the story of Harvard ROTC is far from one of integration and inclusion. Shaiba and Danny should have realized that it is disingenuous to say that ROTC has returned to Harvard’s campus. Perhaps most importantly, they should have known that the current policies surrounding both single gender organizations and ROTC could only be described as unfair, exclusionary, and ill conceived.
ROTC was indeed banned from campus due to intense debate about the Vietnam War in 1971. Harvard once had a flourishing ROTC program. In 1969, Harvard ROTC students numbered more than 260 between the three services. The Professor of Military Science, the head of the campus ROTC program, was recognized as a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Harvard ROTC cadets and midshipmen received course credit for the ROTC courses they were (and still are) required to take.
This all changed when ROTC was banned from campus in 1971. Harvard students were still able to participate in ROTC, but training was conducted on MIT’s campus and Harvard eliminated all institutional support for the program. ROTC was not brought back into the fold until 2011, with the official recognition of Naval ROTC, followed by the Army in 2012 and the Air Force in 2016. Unfortunately, no significant changes have taken place for the students actually participating in the program. All the training still occurs at MIT. A more apt name for Harvard ROTC might be “MIT’s ROTC program that includes Harvard students.” Ultimately, the “inclusion” of the ROTC programs is nothing more than a symbolic gesture until Harvard takes steps to truly bring ROTC back to campus.
The story of ROTC and the recent developments regarding single-gender organizations both reflect a trend of exclusion on the basis of personal affiliation, rather than one of inclusion. A simple comparison between the debates surrounding the banning of ROTC and the sanctioning of single-gender organizations illustrates this.
Both single-gender organizations and ROTC are or were perceived to be antithetical to the values of Harvard as an organization. The administration found these differences to be so divisive that they banned ROTC and severed ties with final clubs in 1985. Since then, Harvard has not recognized any male or female social organizations, and like ROTC, these organizations receive no institutional support.
The University’s issuance of sanctions for single gender organizations last semester furthers this comparison. This was not the first time Harvard considered sanctioning students for their personal affiliations. In the Report of the Harvard University Committee on the Status of ROTC, Harvard faculty wrote:
“Harvard is not and should not be responsible for the policies and practices of the wide variety of external organizations in which its students may choose to participate… Some of our students belong to organizations, such as religious or single-sex social clubs, that have membership requirements which would be impermissible under the University's non-discrimination policy. If they are not conducted as Harvard activities and do not receive direct University support, they do not come under University scrutiny… intrusion by the University into the private choices of students, acting as individuals, to form such associations, receive such support, or participate in such external activities would, we believe, be unacceptably paternalistic.”
Those who wrote the policy concerning ROTC knew that sanctioning students because of personal affiliation was wrong and exclusionary. Even during the heated and one-sided debates of the late 60s, Harvard remembered this. Even when students were being bludgeoned by police officers in front of University Hall for their opposition to ROTC, Harvard remembered this. Even when the nation was tearing at the seams with anti-military and anti-institutional discord, Harvard remembered this. Last semester, with less motivation, less pressure, and less public outcry, Harvard forgot this precedent.
There are fewer than 40 ROTC students on campus today compared to more than 260 in 1969. Harvard decimated the ROTC program on campus, failing in its mission to educate all citizens for 40 years by leaving out a significant segment of society—the leaders of the U.S. military. They still have not made the appropriate amends.
Today, much like in 1971, Harvard is attempting to exclude students from the full educational experience at this university because of their independent associations. They are setting a dangerous precedent for students, a “values test” as Professor Harry Lewis states, a precedent that can just as easily be used to punish those students who courageously choose to serve their country if the tide of public opinion were to turn once again.
Edmund Burke said, “Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.” To Shaiba, Danny, and all members of the Harvard administration and faculty: I implore you to understand the mistakes of the past so you do not repeat them in the future. I can only hope that you look to the history of ROTC to see the results of such exclusionary policies and how history has judged the actions of your predecessors and how it may judge yours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent back-and-forth between editors of The Harvard Law Record and Law School spokesperson Michelle Deakin concerning an interview with Law School Dean Martha Minow sheds light on the difficulties that high-level University administrators face in tactfully responding to student inquiries. Though we acknowledge that administrators face a thorny task in balancing the requirements of their offices and the interests of students, we believe that they ought to err on the side of accessibility rather than reticence.
The friction between The Record and the Law School was sparked when Deakin initially refused to allow the paper to publish an interview conducted with Minow, and subsided when the school's communications department later reversed course and permitted them to publish it. The Record, which had emailed a draft of the article to Deakin, quotes an email in which she objects to the article on the basis of its question-and-answer format. Though neither Deakin nor Minow knew that the format would be question-and-answer, it is unclear exactly why Deakin found the format to be objectionable. Minow fielded relatively benign questions that ran the gamut from affirmative action at the Law School to the Chicago Cubs.
Deakin’s objection is all the more puzzling given that The Record was not being inappropriate in any way that justified the administration’s scuttling of the story. In fact, Deakin only managed to voice her objection because the Record indulged the Law School with quote review—a practice which The Crimson and other news sources forbid in order to prevent sources from unduly altering journalists’ stories. Thus, the administration already held an upper hand in the situation, and there was a minimal probability of any sort of misconstrual or misrepresentation of Minow's remarks.
Notwithstanding its overreaction, the Law School’s chariness is understandable. Presciently, when asked what she had learned since becoming Dean, Minow stated “I have much more compassion for people in other positions of power now. People in positions of leadership have to keep much information confidential.” There is no doubt that assuming a position of power demands a degree of discretion. It would be particularly foolish for administrators to run an organization as large and prestigious as the Law School without some level of privacy, especially in times of intense scrutiny from students.
Nevertheless, the administration owes it to the student body to respond to their questions and concerns—particularly after a tumultuous year that has seen tensions run high between students and administrators on issues such as diversity, free speech, and the role that controversial historical markers play at the school. Students have a right to hear from the administration on these contentious issues, and on their concerns in general. The issues that roiled the Law School last year will not dissolve into thin air, and any effort to tackle them will necessarily be collaborative. A thoughtful dialogue is the best way for students and administrators at the Law School to find common ground and move forward, and bureaucratic secrecy will only impede this process and strain relations.
And this continued discourse will only improve the Law School. Administrators have shown that their willingness to listen to students. Notably, the Law School did away with its controversial seal last year at the behest of many students. That decision illustrates how scrutiny and debate can help an institution like the Law School move forward. We hope that administrators follow the example they have set for themselves and remain open to interchange with students—via all outlets possible—in the future.

“So, what did everyone think of the readings this week?”
There was a general ruffling of papers and casting of eyes down towards the floor. “Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today,” drawled a kid from the corner. His lips were pursed into a small “o,” his jaw jutted forward, and his face was topped by a precarious slick of orange hair. “I mean, this guy, I don’t know who he is, he had a lot of great ideas. I liked that he took strong stances on things, I liked that he wasn’t going to stand for these bad hombres getting in the way of his economy. He seemed like he really stood for the little people. The only thing I didn’t like was the title. What language was that? Mexican? Definitely not English. Big mistake. Sad.”
“Um,” another kid piped up from the other side of the room. He glanced at the TF, who seemed too stunned to speak. “We read ‘Mein Kampf’ this week.” He paused. “By Hitler. Adolf Hitler.”
“He’s not my best friend, but he can really write,” the first kid continued. “Truly, one of the best writers, and I know the best writers. I thought the reading was inspiring, very inspiring. It seemed like they were having a lot of problems. These people he was dealing with, not the best. Not winners. Coming in and taking money, jobs. I’m surprised, really, I’m really surprised, that this guy never wanted to build a wall. I built a wall in my common room, a good wall. My roommate can’t get over, and he’s from, uh, Kenya. Think about that. So I’ve had a lot of experience. I mean, with the economy, with business. Have you heard of my startup? We’re doing big things. Yuge things.” He began sliding business cards around the table.
“By ‘people,’” another boy asked, “do you mean the Jews?”
A girl placed her hand on the shoulder of the boy. He winced. The grip was a little too tight. “Thank you, Jim,” she smiled, her teeth pearly white. She rose, her blonde hair immobile. “My friend, Jim, I think that’s a great point. I really do, Jim. This boy here is following a very insidious line of thinking. Something very un-our-section. You know, Jim, it reminds me, Jim, of the time I took a class on World War II last semester. And the semester before that, and every other year at Harvard I’ve taken a course on World War II, and all the courses I took throughout high school were also about WWII. Could you say, Jim, that I was born to speak in this section?” She laughed. “You could say that, Jim. Thank you.” She sat back down, smile still firmly affixed to her lips.
“You’ve taken how many classes? Why are you here?” Someone piped up. There was a general murmur of agreement.
The TF shook himself from his stupor. “Anyways, if we could—”
The orange haired boy kicked his feet up on the desk and jumped in before the TF could finish. “Let me tell you guys something about her. This girl, over here, she’s a nasty student. She writes a paper, some time last year, it could have been two years ago, maybe three. She submits it and she’s put under investigation from the Ad Board. Terrible. Could have been a major plagiarism violation. Could be expelled. Where is the paper? Where is it? She never released it. Very suspicious. She’s not the type of girl we want in our section.”
The blonde girl half rose from her chair. “Just like you, the working people of this section, it is my first time taking a course on World War II. I’ve written papers, just like you. I’ve done readings, just like you. I’ve even skipped some of those readings, I know, even me. See, I’m just like the rest of you. A normal, down-to-earth, very casual kind of student.”
“Let’s move—” the TF tried, halfheartedly, before the blonde girl cut back in.
“And like you, I don’t want to see this section fall prey to this kind of bigotry, and this kind of intolerance.” She gestured at the orange-haired kid, who was shrugging aggressively at his neighbors, lips pursed. “Hitler rose to power because he preyed on the weak minded, and we will not fall under his influence in this section. Three Reichs and you’re out! We will Nazi a Fourth Reich in this section!” She paused. “Get it? Because ‘Nazi’ and ‘not see?’ Guys? Jim?” There was a brief silence, and then uncomfortable nods of assent.
“On. Let’s move on.” The TF blurted out. He sighed heavily. This section always went to hell every four years.

Harvard’s Office of General Counsel will “conduct an immediate review” of a sexually explicit document circulated among the 2012 men’s soccer team, University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement Tuesday.
Last week, The Crimson reported that the men’s soccer team produced a “scouting report” of that year’s freshmen on the women’s soccer team. Among other derogatory and degrading comments, the “report” rated women based on their physical appearance and evaluated them on their perceived sexual appeal.
After consulting with Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith—whose office oversees the Athletics Department—and Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise, Faust wrote she asked OGC, Harvard’s team of lawyers, to review the “report.” According to Faust, the “OGC’s review will be independent of any responsive action undertaken by the Title IX office in accordance with its policies.” 
“I was deeply disturbed to read the news reporting concerning the men’s soccer team. Such behavior is appalling and completely at odds with the mutual respect that is a fundamental value of our community,” Faust wrote. “The offensive and derogatory remarks reported by The Crimson have no place at Harvard.”
It appears that the “scouting reports” were an annual tradition, though Director of Athletics Communications Timothy J. Williamson has repeatedly declined comment on whether reports continued after 2012.
“I want to ensure not only that such actions do not happen again, whether on men’s soccer or any other Harvard team, but also that all members of our community fully understand that such activities have never been, and never will be, acceptable at Harvard,” Faust wrote.
The six members of the women’s soccer team discussed in the “report” responded to The Crimson’s story in a joint op-ed earlier this week.
“We are appalled that female athletes who are told to feel empowered and proud of their abilities are so regularly reduced to a physical appearance,” they wrote.
In a statement provided by Williamson, Scalise wrote that the Athletics Department was “proud and moved by the response of the women's soccer players. Their thoughtful comments and leadership are exemplary."

President Barack Obama intends to appoint Graduate School of Design professors Toni L. Griffin and Alex Krieger to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, he announced in a White House press release Friday.
“These fine public servants bring a depth of experience and tremendous dedication to their important roles. I look forward to working with them,” Obama said in the press release announcing several postings.
The Commission of Fine Arts is a team “charged with giving expert advice to the President, the Congress and the federal and District of Columbia governments on matters of design and aesthetics,” according to its website.
Both Griffin and Krieger are currently professors in practice in the Urban Planning and Design Department.  Krieger was first appointed to the CFA in Sept. 2012 and is up for reappointment for a second term. Members are appointed to four-year terms on the commission.
According to Diane E. Davis, chair of the GSD's Urban Planning and Design Department, having two members serve on a national commission would increase visibility for the department.
“This is an exceptional recognition of our program given that this is not a large commission of which two of the members are from the same department,” Davis said.
For Griffin, this federal appointment marks her first term on the commission.
“She is familiar with the American city experience,” Davis said. “She will bring a special way of understanding how the arts can be celebrated across a variety of locales in the United States.”
Griffin first came to the GSD as an adjunct associate professor between 2006 and 2011, and she returned to the school in Jan. 2016 to teach in urban planning and social equity. Before her time at Harvard, Griffin worked in both the private and public sectors, including for the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation and the Washington, D.C., Department of Planning.
Krieger, who has taught at the GSD since 1977, was the senior planning adviser  for the Harvard Allston Work Team and has served on design review teams for Harvard’s Cambridge and Allston campuses.
“Professor Krieger is really known for his significant contributions to the city of Boston,” Davis said. “It is also fitting that we have a professor that goes deep into one city as well as one who casts her net more broadly. ”
Currently, six of the seven members of the commission—including Krieger— have ties with the University. Five members have received a degree from the GSD or served as a professor or fellow there.
Krieger and Griffin declined to comment, citing White House policy to not speak publicly on appointments until they are finalized.

In a joint project to collect library books for return, a new book drop was opened in Currier House by Harvard College, the Harvard College Library, the Harvard Library system, and Harvard Mail Services.
As of Oct. 31, students have been able to drop library materials into a bin located in the foyer of Currier’s main entrance—a popular spot where students wait to catch the Quad shuttle.

“The new book drop will allow students living at the Quad a convenient location to return books near their residences,” Associate Director for Access Services for FAS Libraries Joshua A. Parker wrote in an email.
The project took approximately two months to implement, according to Interim Associate University Librarian for Research and Education Kenneth J. Peterson. Harvard University Mail Services couriers will collect the materials from the bin every weekday, according to Peterson. The couriers will then deliver them to a library on the same day for check-in. These materials can also be returned to any circulating library across campus.
“Book returns are a regular service in library operations and installed in many locations. We are pleased to add this service to the Quad and look forward to evaluating this service in the future,” Peterson wrote in an emailed statement.
Though the book drop may prove useful, especially for students doing research or writing senior theses, several students were not immediately aware of the book drop's installation.
Brianna K. Bolon ’19 was not initially aware of the new service, but upon discovering it, she said the book drop would “definitely help.”
“I saw it walking by yesterday, but I didn’t really know what it was about. It sounds cool. I would definitely use it if I needed to,” Bolon said.

Harvard’s traditional revenue sources—including returns on its endowment—may be subdued in the coming years, a reality that could “significantly constrain” future University budgets, according to Harvard’s annual financial report released Tuesday.
The report, written by Thomas J. Hollister, vice president for finance, and Paul J. Finnegan ’75, a Harvard Corporation member and the University treasurer, detailed the University's finances for fiscal year 2016, a year in which the value of Harvard’s endowment shrunk by almost $2 billion. The investment losses have prompted concern from some University leaders, including University President Drew G. Faust, about Harvard’s future financial capabilities.
“If, as some expect, higher education revenue growth rates are in the 2-3% range in the next few years, down from 4-5% in the recent past, it will significantly constrain the University’s ability to increase budgets,” the report reads. 
While performance within Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm, contributed to the poor returns, broader financial forces and decreased federal funding threaten to undercut established revenue sources for the University.
Because of the University’s poor endowment returns, the value of its net assets dropped more than $2 billion from $44.6 billion to $42.4 billion. Still, Harvard posted a budget surplus of $77 million in fiscal year 2016. Posting a budget surplus is not unusual for Harvard, FY 2016 marked the third consecutive year in which the University posted a surplus.
While federal aid to Harvard increased to $597 million in FY 2016—a 3 percent rise from FY 2015—the report warned that “federal research funding faces an increasingly uncertain political climate” and may continue to wane in the coming years. Consequently, the reported noted, Harvard faculty members and researchers have increasingly sought funding from non-federal sources like foundations, corporations, and individual donors. Funding from these non-federal sources increased 9 percent to $248 million in fiscal year 2016.
Of the University’s $4.8 billion in operating revenue in fiscal year 2016, money paid out from the endowment still made up a plurality of the University’s budget; HMC paid out 5.1 percent of its value, or $1.7 billion, to University budgets. Current-use donations totaled $421 million of operating revenue in the midst of Harvard’s record-setting fundraising drive, and Harvard generated nearly $1 billion in revenue from student fees.
Harvard hopes to grow alternative revenue sources, including executive and continuing education programs and licensing royalties, both of which generated more money in the past year.
The changing landscape for University revenues has prompted budget adjustments across Harvard, according to the report.
“Colleges and universities across the country are facing challenging endowment returns and intense pressures on both federal research funding and tuition revenue,” Faust said in a statement. “Long-anticipated shifts across the sector have arrived, and they have the potential to alter fundamentally the ways in which teaching, learning, and research are accomplished.”
Harvard also decreased its debt burden from $5.5 billion to a “manageable” $5.2 billion, taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance $2.5 billion in bonds.
University expenses increased 5.3 percent to $4.7 billion, driven primarily by increases in employee salaries and benefits. Harvard also spent $597 million on construction projects, including renovations of the Smith Campus Center and Winthrop House as well as the “early capital activity” for the planned School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex in Allston.
The new CEO of Harvard Management Company, N.P. Narvekar, will direct the University’s largest revenue source beginning in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University is gearing up for a union election on Nov. 16 and 17, in which eligible graduate and undergraduate students will decide if they want a union to represent them for the purposes of collective bargaining.
On Tuesday, University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran sent eligible students an official National Labor Relations Board-issued “Notice of Petition for Election.” The notice outlines student rights and election rules, and states that “every effort will be made to protect your right to a free choice under the law.”
As required under NLRB rules, the University released eligible students’ information to the labor board Oct. 28 and to the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers Tuesday, according to University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven.
HGSU-UAW organizers reached out to undergraduates Tuesday, notifying them of their voter eligibility in the election and inviting them to an information session on Thursday.
Columbia will soon follow Harvard’s lead; Columbia’s university provost announced in an email to students on Monday that their union election will take place Dec. 7 and 8, according to the Columbia Daily Spectator. Eligibility for Columbia’s potential bargaining unit mirrors Harvard’s, which also follows the NLRB's definition of employee and includes graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants—including course assistants, graders, and preceptors—as well as graduate student research assistants.
Both Harvard and Columbia’s graduate student union efforts are affiliated with the United Auto Workers union, which represents workers at a wide range of workplaces, including factories, corporations, and universities.
The UAW is affiliated with graduate students at the three private universities that have made significant headway on unionization: NYU, Columbia, and Harvard. In 2013, NYU became the first private university to recognize a graduate student union since 2005, and Harvard and Columbia are the only Ivy League universities with election dates set.
UAW Region 9A Director Julie Kushner, who serves as the UAW’s regional director for northeastern areas including Massachusetts and New York City, wrote in a statement that “this activity in higher education is long standing in the UAW.”
“The UAW has represented employees at universities for 50 years or more and in particular, we’ve been involved with academic workers for some time,” Kushner wrote. “We have a lot of experience at the bargaining table with universities.”
The finalized voting locations will span several of Harvard’s campuses, with students casting their ballots at the Phillips Brooks House in Harvard Yard, the Dental School’s Research and Education Building in Longwood, and on Nov. 17 only, at the Business School in Allston.
The secret ballot voting will take place between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. both days, with a two hour break at 2:30 p.m. Voting at the Business School will only take place Nov. 17 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend Dudley House is celebrating its 25th anniversary as a center for graduate students at Harvard.
Dudley House has been home to Harvard’s students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences since 1991, and aims to combat the loneliness graduate school can engender by giving students across academic programs a place to gather, according to James M. Hogle, the faculty dean of Dudley House.
With its building for graduate students located in Harvard Yard’s Lehman Hall, Dudley houses Café Gato Rojo, a library, game room, dining hall, and spaces for graduate students across all of the GSAS departments to get to know one another, work, and relax.
“Graduate school can become an isolating experience, and Dudley House gives [students] an opportunity to meet people outside their degree programs and encourages them to consider the fact that they are whole people—not just people chained to a laboratory bench or a library carrel,” Hogle said.
Indeed, Dudley House employs a group of around 26 graduate students every year, known as the “Dudley Fellows,” who work in nine programming areas to organize activities, student publications, and events.
“This place is fabulous. This is students’ home away from home. And it’s inspired by and a part of the House system,” Susan Zawalich, the administrator of Dudley House, said. Along with housing graduate students, Dudley is also the home for some undergraduate students living outside the College's residential House system.
Yet, Dudley House has not always been the center of graduate student life. The House was founded in 1935 and originally known as the Center for Off Campus Boys, according to a history of Dudley prepared by Hogle.
But, in the 1980s, graduate students started pushing for a place of their own. Garth O. McCavana, the current dean of student affairs for GSAS, was vice president of the Graduate Student Council at the time and was the first student to sign the petition for a community center.
“We petitioned for a place in the Yard, a library space, and a café—and we got everything that we asked for,” McCavana said.
In 1991, Dudley transitioned from being the non-resident undergraduate House to serving a small community of undergraduates and all of the graduate students in GSAS.
Twenty-five years later, Dudley House is celebrating with a weekend full of events, including an open house, a reunion for the Dudley Fellows, and a beer tasting.
While many Harvard students know Dudley House as a place where they can relax or grab a cup of coffee, its central location also serves as a key landmark for tourists.
“Along with John Harvard, it’s the most photographed spot in Harvard Yard,” McCavana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton make the final push before Election Day on Nov. 8, Harvard faculty are working to integrate the historic moment into their teaching.
Andrew Warren, the professor behind the course English 190we: “David Foster Wallace,” said this year’s election was the closest he had seen to the “bent reality” of David Foster Wallace’s novel Infinite Jest.
That sentiment inspired the 14-hour public reading that he is planning in the Barker Center Cafe on Election Day. Wallace, often political in his writing, specifically engaged with electoral politics in Infinite Jest, where Nov. 8, or “Interdependence Day” is the biggest holiday in the world of the novel.
Warren said he is working together with his students to find the parts of the novel best suited to being read aloud, and also hopes to involve other faculty members, deans, and potentially friends and fans of Wallace from the Boston area.
By all indications, it looks likely to be a popular gambit; 130 individuals have indicated they are interested in the event on Facebook.
Maxine Isaacs, who teaches the freshman seminar “American Presidential Campaigns and Elections 1960-2016,” is taking a different approach. As results come out, she wants students to “sit back and enjoy,” she said, and take a break from rigorous analysis.
“They’ve been working hard and election nights are very exciting, no matter how they come out,” she said.
However, once the excitement of election night dies down, she said she expects students to put their minds to work again. In her class on Wednesday, the day after the election, she hopes her seminar will collectively begin to draw conclusions about the election. She plans to bring veteran Boston Globe political reporter Thomas “Tom” Oliphant into the class to look at exit polls and “try to make some sense of it all.”
Meanwhile, the Mahindra Humanities Center is planning to host a panel called “Dark and Stormy: Reflections on the Election” the day following the election. The panel will include professors from different fields, including history, philosophy and economics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences sparred over a motion opposing the College’s historic sanctions of unrecognized single-gender social organizations Tuesday afternoon, filling all of the seats in the meeting hall and crowding by the doors.
Former Dean of the College and computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 introduced the motion for discussion at the meeting, arguing that the College was “creating a blacklist” by penalizing students who choose to join the unrecognized single-gender social clubs. Lewis also requested that a potential December vote on the motion be done by paper ballot, not by the customary verbal “yea” or “nay.”
“The policy teaches our students, who watch everything we do, bad lessons,” Lewis, one of 12 original signatories of the motion, said. “It is illiberal. It teaches students that it is okay to sacrifice basic individual freedoms in pursuit of large but only vaguely related social goals.”
Announced in May, the College’s policy—which, starting with the Class of 2021, will prohibit members of those organizations from student leadership positions and College endorsement for top fellowships—has been met with mixed reactions. While many Harvard affiliates, including coaches, professors, and members of the Harvard Corporation have expressed their support for the policy, hundreds of students, faculty, and former administrators have publicly criticized the decision.
Lewis believes if the motion is passed by a Faculty vote, it would strike down the sanctions. But administrators have remained silent on whether the faculty motion would override them.
At Tuesday’s meeting, University President Drew G. Faust did not specifically answer a question from Classics professor Richard F. Thomas about the power of the motion.
“There has been some uncertainty about whether the Faculty’s vote on this motion, if affirmative, would decide the matter,” Thomas said. “Could I ask you to reassure us that you share my understanding of the Faculty’s jurisdiction in this case?”
Faust declined to answer yes or no, instead encouraging faculty to consider closely “the urgency of the problem” of the single-gender organizations. The earliest date at which the motion could go to vote is at the next full Faculty meeting in December.
“Your question uses the words authority and jurisdiction,” Faust responded to Thomas. “I find it more helpful to think of our work together as rooted in notions of shared governance.”
In an interview earlier Tuesday, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith also did not provide a definitive answer on whether the motion could strike down the policy, instead saying he wanted the Faculty to discuss the issues further.
“Through that discussion we will come to a decision of how to move forward,” Smith said.
The Faculty Council declined to vote on the motion in its last meeting. David L. Howell, a Faculty Council member and Japanese history professor, later said the body postponed a decision because the motion does not currently reference the single-gender social organization policy specifically.
At the meeting, Faust said she endorsed the policy in May because she “did not believe the University and its leadership—its President, its FAS and College deans—can any longer avoid the issues raised by single-gender social organizations for the inclusivity and safety of our campus community, as well as for equal access and opportunity for our students.”
After Lewis delivered his statement, several professors, as well as the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council, took to the floor to voice their views on the College’s policy and the motion.
Defending the sanctions, Human and Evolutionary Biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 said the motion was redundant to existing nondiscrimination policies in the Harvard College handbook.
If the motion passes, Lieberman said, “The final clubs, fraternities and sororities will go unchecked, we will face a deluge of unrecognized Greek organizations that will continue to erode our House system, and we will find our campus riven by more, not less, discrimination.”
“In short, this motion sounds good on the surface but it will paradoxically harm rather than help us to promote inclusion and fight discrimination,” he concluded.
Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, a history professor, agreed, and said she sees the sanctions as a step towards a more modern and inclusive Harvard, contrasting the overwhelming white and male portraits in the Faculty Room with the more diverse gathering of faculty present.
But Eric M. Nelson ’99, a government professor, delivered a scathing condemnation of the sanctions, contending that the policy is a threat to academic freedom and an “alarming recharacterization of the relationship between the College and its students.”
“The proposed sanctions represent, without question, the most significant change in the disciplinary posture of the College to be announced in decades—far more significant, for example, than the honor code that we recently implemented by Faculty legislation. And yet this matter was never brought to the Faculty,” he said.
After months of withholding their public opinion on the sanctions, UC president and vice president Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17 expressed their support for the policy in a joint speech, which drew Faculty applause.
Banks said that he and Rather “view this policy as an opportunity for a new chapter in Harvard’s history.”
“To claim that these institutions are not part of the Harvard community is to hide history and fact behind technicality,” said Banks, referring to the school’s final clubs and Greek organizations. “For students, this is not a political or philosophical debate, this is our experience at Harvard. It is deeply personal.”
History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74 came away from the meeting unimpressed with both the policy and the motion opposing it.
“To me the problem with the policy is what it’s fundamentally aiming at is sexual abuse, aggression, harassment, and yet it’s somewhat of a blunt instrument,” Gordon said. “I also feel immense frustration at the motion because of the way it’s framed without reference to what’s actually in the policy.”
“So frankly, I’m not in support of the motion, but I’m not thrilled with the policy either,” Gordon said.
Though some professors said after the meeting that the discussion was productive, others expressed disappointment that it was cut short to move on to other business. History professor Michael McCormick called discussion of the motion “stimulating but rather short.”
“Clearly there were many people who wished to speak but did not have the possibility to do so,” McCormick said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Charles T. "Chuck" Hagel lamented the current state of American presidential politics at the Kennedy School on Tuesday, chastising the GOP and its presidential nominee Donald Trump.
Hagel, who was President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense from 2013 to 2015, previously served as a Republican U.S. Senator for Nebraska from 1997 to 2009. A controversial appointment for defense secretary, Hagel resigned after two years under pressure from the White House. He is now a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
In an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday, Hagel described the the current state of the GOP as “rudderless” and “leaderless.” He said it is unclear how the Republican Party will convalesce after the upcoming election.
“This is going to be awhile before a new Republican Party center of gravity forms, and I think it’s going to go right into the next presidential election before we see any kind of cohesion. And I’m not sure you’re even going to see it then,” he said.
Hagel also shared pointed criticism about Trump.
“[H]e’s not a Republican, he’s not a Republican leader. I mean he’s never led anything. I mean Donald Trump is a product of the environment. He is an instrument and a voice of the tremendous, deep-seated discontent and anger in this country with politics, with Washington, and with government,” Hagel said. “He didn’t lead that movement. He was the voice. So, he’s never been involved in any philosophical or any governmental effort on anything.”
Hagel also touched on the potential for Russian interference in next week’s election. Although Russians could interfere by spreading misinformation and “playing games,” Hagel said it would be hard for Russia to hack polling stations.
“Our balloting is controlled county-by-county in the United States, state-by-state. So there’s no one central computer system where they could hack into and influence votes… the likelihood they could affect any balloting is just not very feasible because it’s so decentralized.”
He encouraged the next president to sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“I’ve said publicly that the next president of the United States, I firmly believe, needs to sit down directly with President Putin and engage President Putin face-to-face on all these big issues,” he said. “Because these things don't get better, and the Russians are doing things that we haven't seen them do since the Cold War.”
A few hours later at the IOP’s John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum, Hagel elaborated on his concerns with the current state of political discourse and national security, saying “politics reflects society.”
“We are at one of those points that historians will reflect on where there is great distrust in our leaders, in our politics, in almost every institution—except the military,” he said. “I’m not surprised at the political dynamics in play today… our media plays on confrontation and conflict. It’s not really about information or enlightening the public.”
During the interview before the event, Hagel said he is still undecided on who he will cast his ballot for next Tuesday.
“I mean you’ve got the two most vilified, distrusted candidates in the history of America… this is going to be an election about not voting for someone, it’s going to be more about voting against someone.”
Yet, Hagel emphasized he will exercise his right to vote, a right he said he does not take for granted.
“My first vote was cast on a tank in Vietnam in 1968. And I’ve never missed a federal election every two years—I’m not going to miss this one. I haven't even focused on it yet, I’ll vote though.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Graduate School of Education professors argued that systemic educational reform is necessary to close the achievement gap during a discussion on educational inequality at an event Tuesday.
The event, titled “The Achievement Gap: Who Gets Left Behind and Why?” and sponsored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, featured Katherine K. Merseth and Susan M. Johnson, who both teach at the GSE.
Both professors touched on the debate over whether states or the federal government take responsibility when it comes to education. Merseth said education is part of state as opposed to federal responsibility.
“The word ‘education’ does not appear in our Constitution," she said. “Should a child in rural New Mexico know what a child in the city of Chicago knows?”
Johnson added that differences in education quality do not only occur between states but also within states.
Merseth criticized programs like Teach for America for their high teacher turnover rates. Participants in these programs teach in poverty-stricken areas, but leave their students behind in just two years, she said.
“These are children who have been abandoned,” Merseth said. “They’re beginning to develop their own social identity that ‘nobody cares about me.’”
Student moderator and Harvard Foundation intern Nuha Saho ’18 said he appreciated the range of opinions provided by the two professors, both alumni of the GSE.
“The coolest part of the event was that they didn’t come in with the exact same ideas,” he said. “They basically learned from each other but they actually still differ on things.”
The other moderator, Brenda Esqueda ’20, said the discussion brought up more questions about education than she had previously anticipated.
“The contrast in opinions was amazing,” said.

UPDATED: November 2, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.
Harvard Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 voiced support for the College’s historic sanctions on members of single-gender social organizations at Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, marking their first public stance on the controversial policy in the six months since its announcement.
At the meeting, where members of FAS discussed a motion to oppose the College policy, Rather said she and Banks believe the sanctions will address discrimination on campus and create “a Harvard College that holds its students to principles of non-discrimination, inclusion, and belonging.”
 
Rather clarified that she and Banks were speaking on behalf of their own perspective, and not the views of the UC as a whole.
She acknowledged that the debate around final clubs and Greek organizations was  was “complex” and recognized that undergraduates remain divided on the policy.
"Campus is polarized and we recognize that there are peers of ours who will disagree with us," said Rather, who serves with Banks alongside other Harvard undergraduates on the College’s committee to recommend how to enforce the sanctions.
The sanctions, announced in May, bar undergraduates starting with the Class of 2021 from holding student leadership positions or receiving College-endorsed fellowships if they are members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations such as final clubs and Greek organizations. The policy has been met with mixed reactions  from students, faculty, and alumni alike. Many Harvard affiliates, including coaches, professors, and members of the Harvard Corporation have expressed support for the policy, but students, faculty, and former administrators have publicly criticized the decision.
Just hours after the sanctions were announced, Rather and Banks sent an email to undergraduates expressing concern about the policy’s implementation, and suggested that the College’s policy needed to be “more nuanced” and include “student voice at every level” to be effective. They also said they took fault with “the University’s timeline in releasing these recommendations” at the end of the semester during final exams.
Rather and Banks have focused their tenure around promoting of four “compelling interests” of student life: mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces. Their platform during the UC’s presidential election last November included a goal to “Open Harvard,” which included pushing final clubs towards open punch, transparent membership demographics, and regular open parties.
Banks said that, though Harvard has been working to “rid itself of the exclusionary vestiges” that he said used to characterize the College’s social scene, the sanctions may help to facilitate the process towards inclusivity.
“While we understand that organic culture change is ideal, we recognize that that change that has occurred on campus has not had… the speed needed to combat the weight of these [negative] externalities,” Rather said at the meeting.
The two UC leaders had not previously taken a public stance on the policy, though they spoke to the Faculty Council about them in September. Rather and Banks said they will publish an op-ed explaining their position on the sanctions policy in the near future.
“We view this policy as an opportunity for a new chapter in Harvard’s history,” Rather said at the meeting Tuesday.
At the meeting Tuesday, former Dean of the College and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis '68 presented a motion to oppose the sanctions, arguing that they infringe on freedom of association.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith urged professors to encourage their eligible students to participate in the upcoming unionization vote, though he declined to share his opinion on unionization.
In mid-October, the University and Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, the group of graduate students moving to unionize, agreed to hold an election on Nov. 16 and 17. The election will determine whether or not the HGSU-UAW represents these students formally. The election results also will impact how the eligible voters—graduate and undergraduate teaching fellows, course assistants, and graduate student research assistants—interact with the University, Smith said during Tuesday’s monthly FAS meeting.
“This decision is consequential,” he said. “It is a fork in the road for the University. There is no do-over. There is no opt out.”
According to Smith, 3,500 students enrolled in 11 schools and in more than 50 degree programs will be able to cast their vote. Eligible graduate and undergraduate voters can cast their votes at polling stations in Cambridge, Longwood, and Allston, Smith said.
“This election will be decided by students, but only students who vote will have a say,” Smith said, urging the Faculty to encourage their students to explore the issues around unionization and ultimately to vote.
During an interview earlier Tuesday, Smith declined to share his opinion on undergraduate and graduate unionization, simultaneously citing his desire to let voters express their views and emphasizing how their decision ultimately will affect “everybody” on campus.
“I will not get out in front of the vote,” Smith said. “Those students—it’s their decision to decide whether they want to form a union.”
At Tuesday’s meeting, members of the Faculty also shared polar views about a motion opposing the College’s controversial policy on unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Since the College passed its policy—which, starting with the Class of 2021, will prohibit members of those organizations from student leadership positions in recognized groups and College endorsement for top fellowships—professors and students have aired mixed views.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Music and African and African American Studies professor Kay K. Shelemay updated the full Faculty on the recent work of the 37-member committee tasked with recommending how to implement the new College policy.
According to Shelemay, who co-chairs the committee with University Professor and Eliot House Faculty Dean Douglas A. Melton, the full committee has met and has listened to representatives from the Undergraduate Council and members of various single-gender social organizations. In addition, subcommittees have started to meet and will draft recommendations in the new year, she said.
The Faculty also approved a proposal to delegate to the Faculty Council the power to recommend the rescission of degrees from the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Extension School. At least two-thirds of the Council present at a given Council meeting will need to vote in favor of revoking a degree for that degree to be rescinded.
In addition, the Faculty approved an updated version of the Faculty Council election procedures.
University President Drew G. Faust at the meeting also announced 16 newly tenured members of the Faculty and presented several with honorary Harvard degrees.

It was nearing midnight and Edward B. Childs, a chef in Adams House who had manned picket lines on campus since 7 a.m., was visibly exhausted.  But when asked how he was feeling that night as he marched with other dining workers, Childs said, “energized.”
Earlier that night, HUDS workers and student supporters were asked to leave 124 Mt. Auburn St., where they staged a nearly seven hour-long sit in. Still, Childs and about 15 other workers and students, remained posted outside of the building, chanting and singing protest songs.
They were awaiting news from three floors above, where the bargaining committees for both Harvard and UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union representing HUDS workers—were parsing through the final details of a contract settlement that was nearly five months in the making. Their bargaining session, punctuated by sudden cheers and rally chants from the people below, dragged on.
By 1 a.m., the two parties reached an agreement. The following day, HUDS workers voted to approve a new five-year contract that addressed their initial concerns about wages and health benefits. Both sides view the settlement as their victory.
The settlement ended a three-week long dining workers’ strike, which rocked Harvard’s campus and shut down nearly half of the College’s undergraduate dining halls. Their strike marked the first time in their history of bargaining with Harvard that the dining workers walked off the job during the academic year.
For both sides of the bargaining table, the strike was exhausting. HUDS workers manned picket lines for 22 days in a row, receiving only $40 per day from their union. University administrators, who maintained they bargained in “good faith” throughout the process, grew frustrated at the workers’ choice to prolong the strike.
In an email to administrative deans after the contract was ratified, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp expressed that frustration.
“We are disappointed that the union only began to seriously negotiate on the main issues of wages and changes to health care during the final days of the strike,” Lapp wrote. “Deeper and earlier engagement by the union could have resulted in an agreement sooner and ensured that dining workers were not without pay for such an extended period.”
Ultimately, Harvard and its dining workers agreed on a contract that effectively established a $35,000 minimum salary for full time employees and curtailed any expected increases in out-of-pocket health expenses for the life of the five-year agreement.  They will maintain their health care plan until 2019, when they will transition into the coverage Harvard’s largest union negotiated last winter.
“The agreement represents the fair and reasonable resolution sought by the University,” Lapp wrote.  “It includes affordable wage increases in line with those agreed by other unions on campus; compensation over the summer months; and structural changes to health insurance that will align benefits for Local 26 workers with those of other unionized employees.”
While the University characterized the settlement as a favorable outcome, Local 26 said they felt the gains they made could set a precedent for negotiations with other employers.
“A $35,000 annual income is now the standard that we’re going to put forward in all of our campus dining negotiations going forward,” Lang said. “The next one is Northeastern, which expires in August of 2017. We intend to pursue the same program for the other universities—it only makes sense.”
SETTING THE STANDARD?
Local 26 may have its sights set on negotiations at other institutions, but two other campus unions currently engaged in contract talks with Harvard are eyeing the HUDS settlement with particular interest.
The first, the Harvard Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union—which has been bargaining with the University since the summer, when their previous contract was set to expire—has seen relatively little progress. According to Sean McNally, the union’s trustee, they have only met with Harvard seven times since the beginning of their bargaining process. HUSPMGU’s contract, initially slated to expire in June, was extended until Dec. 1 in the hopes that an agreement can be reached before, McNally said.
HUSPMGU represents about 80 employees who primarily work in the Harvard Art Museums. According to McNally, the union is comprised of some of the lowest paid employees at the University, with 50 percent of the union’s membership making $15.47 per hour.
“There’s been a lot of information out there about the living wage in Cambridge, what the dining services workers are making, but unfortunately we are at the bottom,” McNally said.
McNally said that while the union’s goals are similar to those of Local 26, they could not make the same proposals because the details of Local 26’s settlement were released after the union had submitted its offers. While McNally would not detail HUSPMGU’s proposals, he said the union’s overarching goal is to “bridge the gap” in wages between its workers and members of other campus unions, like the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
“Did we model our proposals after Local 26’s? No,” McNally said. “Are we looking for similar things? We’re hoping to keep our health care costs reasonable and manageable, and we’re trying to bridge the gap is the best way to describe it.”
He said the union has looked at the contracts of the eight other campus unions ahead of their negotiations.
32BJ SEIU, which represents Harvard’s custodial staff and security guards, began bargaining in October, and would not comment on how the HUDS settlement would affect their negotiations. Union spokesperson Eugenio H. Villasante wrote in an email that “Local 26 and 32BJ share the same values that lead us every day to make sure we create a pathway to the middle class for thousands of families,” adding that “the path will be determined by the membership, but the goal remains the same: a fair contract.”
“Broadly speaking, the main bread and butter issues are fair wage increases to keep up with the rising cost of living, maintaining affordable family health care and ensuring adequate funds for retirement,” Villasante wrote.
According to another SEIU union organizer, Jason Faria, the union has already submitted its proposals for both its janitors and security guards to the University. Negotiation sessions between the two parties’ bargaining units are scheduled for Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and on Monday, they rallied in front of Massachusetts Hall to draw attention to their negotiations.
Ahead of the rally, union organizers door-dropped bright orange flyers that invoked the “lessons of the Harvard Dining Hall Strike.”
“We are hopeful Harvard will respond to our demands in a way that provides a path to a fair and peaceful settlement before the expiration of our contracts on November 15,” the flyer reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Ivy League football is a 10-week hike. The players trudge beneath hot sun and cold rain. They trek through fields of mud and shrapnel-like turf pellets. They wear sweaty jerseys and knee braces. They carry each other.
Harvard football has played seven weeks of football. Simple math shows that three remain: home against Columbia, away against Penn, and home against Yale. Win all three, and the Crimson will claim a fourth-straight championship.
Harvard has not lost in conference play. Nor have the Quakers. At the start of every season, the fight for the Ivy League title is a multi-team, free-for-all frenzy. Now it is a duel.
On Saturday, the Crimson will host Columbia, a historically bendable program that has stiffened into a tough out. Gone are the days when the Lions’ only claim to relevance was a record-breaking losing streak. Already in 2016, Columbia has matched its win total from the previous three seasons combined.
Granted, winning two games is a low bar, but the program has improved in all the intangibles that coach Al Bagnoli emphasizes. The defense hits hard and hangs tough. Players speak with renewed pride. The Lions aren’t the kings of the jungle, but at least they’ve escaped Petco.
Harvard should still beat Columbia, probably by a lot. Even in this season of attrition, the Crimson has stockpiled enough talent to survive. Senior halfback Anthony Firkser and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley bully single coverage. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano torments defenses with his feet. And Harvard’s defense—though far from perfect—has yielded only seven first-half points in the last two contests combined.
But the Lions deserve serious preparation. In 2015, Columbia rebounded from a 24-3 deficit against the Crimson to get within one score; only a late false-start penalty prevented the Lions from potentially mounting a game-tying drive. If Harvard does record a blowout on Saturday, then that result will testify more to the team’s strength than Columbia’s weakness.
Let us suppose, however, that the Crimson wins on Saturday. At that point, all the Ivy League’s attention will turn to the matchup that has been building since the first day of preseason: Harvard versus Penn.
The Quakers are scary good. We knew as much back in August. In 2015 Penn handed Harvard its only loss and claimed a share of the Ancient Eight title.
Now in 2016, the program has returned starting quarterback Alek Torgersen and star receiver Justin Watson, arguably the only wideout better than Shelton-Mosley. Toss in a veteran defense, and the Quakers possess incredible potential.
Penn has largely fulfilled these expectations. The season began with two losses to tough non-conference foes, but since then the Quakers have won five straight, putting up 35 or more points in all but one league game. Down went Dartmouth, 37-24. Down went Yale, 42-7.
This weekend marks a major test for Penn, as the team visits third-place Princeton. If the Quakers emerge victorious, then they will roll into the Harvard game with a head full of steam. As Terrell Owens might say, get your popcorn ready.
Does the Crimson have enough to beat Penn? Last year, the answer was yes—except that Harvard lost, a victim of sluggish play, bad luck, and 24 mile-per-hour winds. That 35-25 defeat was the lone blemish for Harvard in 2015. It was a crushing loss.
This year, in my view, your expectations for the Crimson-Quakers contest depend on your opinion of the Harvard secondary. Statistically speaking, quarterbacks have scorched that unit. Last weekend Dartmouth’s Jack Heneghan saved his job by tossing for 301 yards—in essentially three quarters of play. In three of the last four games, opponents have out-passed the Crimson. Many of these throws have come to wide-open targets—receivers who somehow have streaked down the sideline without anyone noticing.
The Big Green managed to come back last Saturday because the secondary had more holes than a fishing net. It was not an inspiring performance with Justin Watson on the horizon.
At the same time, Harvard’s defensive backs are aggressive and opportunistic. Captain Sean Ahern is the best shutdown corner in the league. Safeties Tanner Lee, Kolbi Brown, and Tim Haehl can all play.
It’s hard to explain why a unit with so much talent has given up so many yards. The problem seems to lie more in miscommunication than one-on-one coverage. When locked onto an opponent, Crimson defensive backs can swat away passes and make tackles. But issues arise when they don’t lock on. Against a pair as skilled as Torgersen and Watson, such mistakes tend to be ruinous.
Harvard coaches have a week-and-a-half of practices to fix any weaknesses in the secondary. The team could use every minute of that preparation. Ivy League football is, after all, a 10-week hike. And the only guarantee is that there is no rest until the final summit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s elite contingent of professional athletes continue to make a substantial impact as we near the end of 2016.
JEREMY LIN ‘10
The Nets’ brand-new starting point guard and lone Ivy alum in the NBA, is off strong start in his seventh year in the league. Through four games, Lin is averaging 16.3 points, 6.5 assists, and 4.3 rebounds, all of which would be good for career-highs. A down year in Brooklyn figures to give Lin the opportunity to cement himself as a centerpiece of the team.
RYAN FITZPATRICK ’05
The former Crimson standout's struggles have been well-documented through the first eight weeks of the 2016 NFL season. A dismal performance against the Chiefs in Week 3—a game in which he went 20-for-44 in the air and threw six picks—helped lead to his league-leading 11 interceptions and lowest completion rate (56.1%) among QBs with at least 200 attempts. With replacement Geno Smith out for the season after tearing his ACL in Week 7, Fitzpatrick regained the chance to turn around the Jets disappointing 3-5 start after a 2015-16 resurgence.
JIMMY VESEY '16
The New York Rangers’ is tied for second in the NHL with six goals, trailing only Tampa Bay’s Steven Stamkos. Vesey’s rookie campaign is off to a flying start, and with nine points, the Boston native is already skating with the first line. The breakout left wing tallied three points last night against the Blues, scored and assisted in a 5-2 dismantling of his hometown Bruins Oct. 26, and netted two goals four days earlier against the Caps. It figures to be a race between Vesey and Toronto’s first overall selection Auston Matthews for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the rookie of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once you flip the calendar to October, it’s time for college hockey. Sure enough, Colgate agrees. A capacity crowd of Raider fans was ready to celebrate the start of the ECAC hockey season at their brand spanking new arena on the first night of the month.
Fast forward. Oct. 7 proved to be another big night for the league, as five different teams were now in action. Most eyes were on defending champion Quinnipiac. Meanwhile, the headlines went to Union, who stunned Michigan in Ann Arbor.
Fast forward to Oct. 14, and then again to Oct. 21. Six ECAC teams had already combined to play 34 games over the first four weekends in October.
As for the other six teams in the conference, they had played none.
Without context, it’s difficult to fathom how anyone could classify a league as fair and balanced when half of its teams get a month-long head start over the rest. That said, the ECAC isn’t at fault. Neither is the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
Blame the Ivy League—where the only ones playing games throughout October are the rulemakers. Under their laws, Ivy League hockey teams are not permitted to play in competition that counts until the fourth Friday prior to Thanksgiving.
Time to fast forward one last time. On Oct. 28—one week prior to the start of the ECAC season for most teams—the shackles were finally lifted from all Ivy skates.
But with one weekend to work with, what kind of game suits an untested team? Playing an opponent with six to eight games under its belt is bound to be dangerous, but throwing the weekend away altogether would be even worse.
“In a perfect world, you would play another Ivy,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 told me. “At least you find somebody that’s got the same set of circumstances.”
But this year, at least for Harvard, that perfect world didn’t exist. In the words of Donato, most of the other Ivies had “already found dance partners." Even Dartmouth—the Crimson’s travel partner—had set up a home game with Michigan (a game the Big Green shockingly won).
So what was Donato’s natural response? Scheduling a weekend slate in the Arizona desert, of course. Harvard spent its first weekend in the Southwest playing Arizona State, the newest member of Division I hockey.
But while Donato won’t say it—no team is to be overlooked, after all—the games might as well have been exhibitions. Sure, they gave the Crimson a chance to shake out some cobwebs, but they certainly didn’t put Harvard to the test.
And now real competition awaits. The Crimson’s conference opener is set for this Friday at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center against Colgate, the team that opened up its new rink on Oct. 1 and now has seven games under its belt.
Contrast those circumstances with those of the Crimson, who not only had to wait until last weekend to play a game, but also had to wait until Oct. 7 to begin practicing.
The nonsensical nature of these rules becomes a topic of conversation at the start of every season. The regulations baffle me year in and year out, but realistically, they shouldn’t. After all, this is the Ivy League—a league unlike any other.
While every league loves to claim that they value academics over athletics, only the Ivy League has turned the mantra into mandate.
From limits on how many players can travel to road games to the lack of games held on weekdays, the Ivy League has crafted all sorts of rules and regulations aimed at minimizing disturbances to academic life for its athletes.
These regulations work when the Ivy League is in control. When everyone plays by the same rules. But when members of the Ivy League go off to play in different conferences like the ECAC, that logic goes out the window. The esteemed Ivy Manual is only hurting its hockey teams, and the legislators of the Ancient Eight need to loosen their grip.
Now, do I expect the rules to ever change? No. After all, the Yale men’s hockey team’s national championship in 2013 likely provided the league with all the evidence it needed to close its ears on the debate for the rest of eternity.
But let’s be honest. Their ears were never open.
