After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Wubba Lubba dub-dub” is something we haven’t heard the infamous Rick Sanchez say a lot this season. Looking back, this season is something viewers truly haven’t seen before.
“Rick and Morty” is a show that originally seemed to pander to an audience of high teenagers trying to find food that quenches their munchies in the middle of the night. Regardless of its original intentions, however, “Rick and Morty” has turned into an immense cultural influence.
The show has progressed—particularly in regards to the development of its characters. Morty went from an awkward teen in love with Jessica to an awkward teen in love with Jessica who might take over The Citadel of Ricks. Rick went from being a terrible person and never showing any true emotion, to staying as a terrible person and slightly opening up in a self deprecating way. All jokes aside, the characters and plot have grown immensely.
“The Rickshank Rickdemption” was action-packed and tremendously humorous. It also had szechuan sauce. It quickly set up the thematic darkness that is prevalent throughout the season, along with Rick’s turn from bored genius to insane villain.
As the family went to a therapist in “Pickle Rick,” it became apparent how truly dysfunctional Rick’s family can be. Meanwhile Rick—who has turned himself into the titular Pickle—avoids family therapy just to avoid family interaction. The theme is expanded on in “Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender,” as Rick gets jealous anytime Morty favors one of the Vindicator “superheroes.” Instead of handling his emotions in a mature way, Rick sabotages his family and leads to the deaths of his “friends.”
The show has developed its characters exactly where they need to be and has set itself up for a fantastic season finale. As a viewer of “Rick and Morty” I have learned not to trust, believe, or expect anything relative to the plot, from Bird Person’s fiance Tammy (a secret agent posing as one of Summer’s friends) to Sleepy Gary (a parasite Jerry thought he had a love affair with). One can expect nothing from tonight's season finale, other than originality and greatness—the only thing the show continues to deliver on a regular basis.

After an eight month delay, Iranian scientist and Harvard affiliate Seyed S. S. Saravi finally arrived in Cambridge, ready to begin his research at Harvard Medical School. In the face of delays and visa difficulties caused by President Trump’s travel ban last January, Saravi’s persistent journey is one we should all keep in mind as we consider the detrimental effects of the ban on not just Harvard affiliates, but refugees and immigrants around the world.
Although the travel ban has faced numerous legal challenges since January, the Trump administration has not backed down. The ban’s latest iteration will be implemented starting on Oct. 18 and will heavily limit or ban immigrants from eight countries, six of which are majority Muslim. Although refugees are not included in this iteration, the administration has signaled that the United States will accept fewer refugees than it has for years.
As we have opined in the past, Trump’s travel ban is not only deeply discriminatory but also a challenge to our fundamental American ideals of promise and opportunity. The ban fails to achieve its professed goal of promoting national security. Immigrants and refugees are already strictly vetted, and foreign nationals from the affected countries have not been a major source of terrorism on United States soil. Instead, the travel ban plays on discriminatory, anti-Muslim fears. It shuts out refugees and immigrants who often apply and wait for years, hoping for security and opportunity. The revisions have changed nothing—the ban remains fundamentally immoral.
Saravi’s story, then, exemplifies how harmful the travel ban has been. His previously-approved visa was suspended following Trump’s executive order, and he spent months working to re-obtain a visa for himself and his wife. There is no doubt that his scientific contributions will benefit medicine and potentially save lives. Not having Saravi is a loss for our country.
We are heartened that Saravi has been able to come to Harvard Medical School, and we commend him for his persistence in the face of difficulty. We are grateful for his important research, which will aid many, and we wish him all the best moving forward. However, his story also underscores the difficulties that other people—who do not have the resources or the backing of an elite university such as Harvard—may face in entering the United States. Even as we have an obligation to support members of our own community, we must continue to use our social and political capital to speak for others as well.
We hope to see more talented international academics, researchers, and students apply to join and contribute to the Harvard community, and we encourage them not to hesitate in the face of hostility from the Trump administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My roommate is a member of the Harvard Republican Club.  In that context, he had the opportunity last Thursday to meet Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of Education, after her heavily-protested speaking engagement at the Institute of Politics.  He later relayed to me that in their brief interaction behind the stage, DeVos seemed less rebuked for her views than disappointed in many of the audience members.  This is a poignant criticism of the College.  My roommate could tell that she had expected Harvard students to be much more discerning.
That expectation was let down in the IOP last week.  As the Secretary came out to speak, large posters were unfurled from the balconies and raised on the forum floor.  Now, many of these messages were warranted and appropriate for the occasion:  Signs supporting Title IX, messages about public money for public schools, posters proclaiming the importance of not leaving minority students behind. These things left a powerful message.
But many messages were neither warranted nor appropriate.  A sign written in large red letters announced “WHITE SUPREMACIST.” And as DeVos was ushered from the room, students shouted that she was what “white supremacy looks like.”
I stand against just about everything Secretary DeVos wants to do with American education.  I believe her proposed voucher system would be abused by the rich and would not help our most vulnerable students, many of whom are minorities.  I believe the federal government can and should play a constructive, nurturing role educating children, young and old.  I believe she is unfit for her job.  In many ways I am the prototypical “anti-DeVos.”  But, having listened to and attempted to learn from her when she spoke, I believe that she truly does want the best for America and all of America’s schoolchildren—albeit being extremely misguided in her methodology.
Furthermore, I understand that the term “white supremacist” applies to some of the most evil people in this country—people who march with torches, call for genocide, spew hatred at others.  The suggestion that Secretary DeVos falls into this category displays a stunning lack of thought about what that title implies. This insulting method of communication as well as some parts of the protest more generally (chanting, booing, making snide comments in the middle of her speech, blocking others’ views and refusing to move) display a shameful disregard of the entire point of Thursday’s event.
The point of Thursday’s event, to paraphrase its moderator Dean Fung, was to engage in a difficult discussion and listen to viewpoints possibly different from our own, understanding that anyone who refuses to listen to such a discussion is under the false impression that they have nothing to learn from those on the other side.
This is not to say that we should refrain from protesting the people and ideas with which we disagree.  Indeed, we as engaged citizens are charged with voicing our opinions, and, as Harassment/Assault Law-Student Team co-presidents Sarah B. Gutman and Marielle Sanchez wrote, with not being “complicit” in our silence.  And to their credit, Thursday’s protesters did for the most part refrain from disrupting the event to the point that a genuine discussion could not take place for those interested.  But just as we are charged with making our voices heard, I believe we are charged with doing so in a way that shows we are informed, intelligent, discerning, and willing to actually hear the views we protest.  Really, it comes down to an obligation to thought.
As a Harvard student, I take the latter obligation especially seriously.  Members of this institution are always in the gaze of the nation; the way we treat others—especially those with whom we disagree—is noted. The example we provide, for better or for worse, is followed.  If we fail even to outline a reasoned argument against a politician’s positions, who will attempt to do the same? Our actions and our ability to listen to and learn from others matter.  Likewise, the perceptions others have about us, Harvard students, matter.  Even the perception of Betsy DeVos.
Unfortunately, the informed, intelligent opposition that did exist in that forum room was muffled by a less becoming type, one that led to less becoming perceptions.  The Secretary’s speech promoting her ideas was met with students I could tell were unwilling to listen to viewpoints different than their own, questions whose askers clearly didn’t want answers, and senseless name-calling equating ignorance with being a white supremacist. In essence, the type of thing that serves only to provide fodder for conservative pundits to tear down an otherwise good cause.
In a response toward the end of the question-and-answer session, DeVos mentioned something to the effect of, “I assure you that I have the best interest of every child at heart.”  A woman in the balcony near me snickered, loudly enough for everyone to hear, “THAT’s a stretch.”
The audience erupted into laughter.
I’d say “undiscerning” was about right.

If you were also off the grid two weekends ago, lugging a cumbersome rucksack through the Cape Cod woods or tripping through the densest foliage known to man, searching for a tiny metal pole that looked just like the rest of the woods, you may have missed some key events.
On Sept. 22, MIT Army ROTC trucked down south for field training at Joint Base Cape Cod in the middle of a tropical storm. President Trump also unleashed a tropical Twitter storm condemning the NFL players who elected not to stand for the national anthem.
President Trump’s statements were unquestionably unpresidential. Laced with profanity, the tweets were unbecoming of the office President Trump occupies. That is undeniable. The worst part is that they reflect a growing sense along all ideological battle lines that when it comes to politics, nothing is off the table any more.
I personally find little encouragement or solidarity in watching players kneel for the anthem. I empathize with those who believe kneeling in front of the flag as the national anthem plays is a slap in the face. It stings. It hurts. I can’t help but wonder how such a protest can be unifying when it seems to be rooted in blatant disrespect towards the United States.
But I think I need to take a step back. Usually I’d say that sitting or kneeling before the flag is an affront to those men and women in uniform who come back from war in a casket draped in the flag, or who wear it on their sleeve into battle. We would therefore do well to hear their thoughts on the matter, as those men and women offer a truly unifying take on the protest.
Nate Boyer was a long snapper for the University of Texas before joining the Seattle Seahawks in free agency. He is also a former U.S. Army Green Beret. (A total badass.) Boyer wrote an open letter to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback at the center of the controversy, and all of us need to read it.
Boyer writes: “Even though my initial reaction to your protest was one of anger, I’m trying to listen to what you’re saying and why you’re doing it. When I told my mom about this article, she cautioned me that ‘the last thing our country needed right now was more hate.’ As usual, she’s right.”
Do you know what happened next? Nate Boyer and Colin Kaepernick actually got together and talked. They discussed the importance of Kaepernick’s message, and how that message could be shaped to not take away from the contributions and service of military members.
They were not alone. Another Army Green Beret whose father served during World War II and whose son served in Afghanistan stated, “it is PRECISELY for men like Kaepernick, and his right to peacefully protest injustice, that we were willing to serve.”
The first thing I ever learned in ROTC was just that—the reasons why we are willing to serve. The U.S. military is virtually the only force in the world that does not swear allegiance to any person. Our oaths tie us not to a monarch, not to a president, but to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.” We literally swear allegiance to a piece of paper, but in doing so, we swear to defend the very essence of America.
We do also swear to obey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, undoubtedly a critical and binding part of the oath. But our allegiance is not contained within their person. For contrast, take the oath of the British armed forces, who swear to be “faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty...”
The U.S. military has paid a high price in its history to defend the principles and values that make us American. It has fought for the rights that allow these NFL players to protest, and it has certainly also earned the right to ask others to respect the American flag and anthem. What the military community shows us is that these two seemingly incompatible realities do not need to divide the country.

The renovated Smith Campus Center will feature a bar for Harvard affiliates on the building’s top floor and a remodeled arcade home to eight food vendors when it opens in September 2018.
The tenth-floor campus bar, overlooking the Charles River and the Allston campus, will serve alcohol and adjoin two fireplaces and “semi-private lounge spaces” that small groups will be able to reserve. Tanya Iatridis, senior director of University Planning, said she envisions the bar as a “flexible” common space where students and faculty members can informally gather during the day and evening.
“I just have this vision—some people eating lunch, talking with friends, individuals doing work, some people in front of a fire,” Iatridis said of the tenth floor common space. “It will change during the time of day, and in the evening, there might be some jazz going on,” she said.
The ground floor will feature a new welcome center and around eight food vendors. Swissbäkers, a family-owned bakery based in Boston, is the only vendor that has been confirmed, but other companies are in talks with Harvard’s real estate office, according to Iatridis.
A new outdoor deck on the second floor of the building facing Dunster Street will serve as one of many public seating areas. The arcade will abut an indoor common space with couches and bleacher seating.
Although the arcade, welcome pavilion, and first floor common spaces, will be open to the public, access to the tenth floor and portions of the second floor will be restricted to Harvard affiliates. The building will be open to the public throughout the day while Harvard affiliates will have 24-hour access to some study and meeting room spaces.
Many of the interior architectural designs for the first, second, and tenth floors of the Brutalist-style building at 1350 Mass. Ave. remain unchanged since preliminary plans were unveiled in January 2015.
While renovations to the building continue on schedule, planning for the project has often been rocky for Harvard, as the University continues to draw criticism from some Cambridge residents and local businesses.
In mid-2015, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal approved revised plans for the University to move ahead with the project after Harvard addressed concerns that the renovated building would encroach upon historic open spaces in the Square. At the onset of the development, several businesses were forced to vacate their ground floor spaces when the building went under construction.
En Boca, a Mediterranean-inspired tapas restaurant, opened across the street from the Smith Campus Center mid-construction in October 2016. After the restaurant closed in June, its parent company filed a lawsuit against the University, alleging that Harvard misrepresented the scope of the renovations on the building that resulted in a loss of foot traffic and ultimately revenue for the restaurant.
The Smith Campus Center, formerly known as the Holyoke Center, was renamed in 2013 following an donation of an undisclosed amount from Richard A. Smith ’46, a former member of the Harvard Corporation, and his wife Susan F. Smith.
At the time of the Smith Center’s groundbreaking ceremony in 2013, University President Drew G. Faust said the building would serve as the “physical embodiment” for her vision of “one University.”
The majority of the building’s administrative offices have remained open during construction, though entrances have shifted several times. For now, Harvard affiliates crowd into a makeshift tunnel on Dunster Street to enter the building. In a year, they’ll pass through a gleaming glass panel facade—the University’s new “front door.”

UPDATED: October 2, 2017 at 3:42 p.m.
After two rounds of voting, the class of 2018 has elected eight senior class marshals.
The group will join six appointed gift marshals to lead the Senior Class Committee.
The Senior Class Committee is charged with organizing class-wide events leading up to Commencement in May, orchestrating the Senior Gift fund, and planning reunion events post-graduation.
Berkeley E. Brown ’18, the class’s first marshal, will lead the Senior Class Committee. She said she was “shocked” when she learned that she had been elected for the top position by her fellow classmates.
“I’m just so excited to be in this role, and so humbled and shocked just by my classmates coming out to vote and supporting me,” Brown said. “I really want these events and initiatives to help allow the class of 2018 to reflect on what’s been important to them in their time here.”
Wyatt M. Robertson ’18, the class’s second marshal, wants to use his role to create a balance between “high-energy” events and occasions for seniors to reflect on their time at Harvard.
The group also includes six program marshals, elected from a pool of 36 candidates, and six gift marshals appointed by the Harvard College Fund.
Program marshals, who work alongside the first and second marshals, will implement and organize programs and events for their year, with continuing involvement after graduation, when they are responsible to help plan and facilitate alumni activities both regionally and online.
Sara S. Surani ’18, one of the elected program marshals, said she is most excited to plan Senior Week and create a “year to remember.”
“As you go to your Houses you have House community, but you lose a part of the class community,” Surani said. “I want to bring back that kind of senior year feels of high school.”
Another program marshal, Jerry G. Nelluvelil ’18, also hopes to foster a sense of class camaraderie by “meeting more people and seeing what other parts of Harvard want from their senior year.”
In addition to each year’s traditional events, Nelluvelil expressed an interest in implementing new ones, such as scavenger hunts in Cambridge.
Six class gift marshals will be responsible for leading the effort to solicit donations from their fellow classmates for the annual Senior Gift campaign. Donations will benefit either the Harvard College Financial Aid Initiative or a separate unrestricted fund for College programming.
Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, a gift marshal, said that he thinks it’s important to support Harvard’s financial aid program.
“A lot of students should know about the opportunity they have during their senior year to benefit future generations of Harvard College students,” Gonzalez said.
Fellow gift marshal Alec K. Reed ’18 echoed the sentiment: “We’re so fortunate to be the beneficiaries of a tradition of alumni giving.”
Over half of the members in the class of 2017 donated to the Senior Gift fund last spring. The average donation in previous years has been roughly $20, according to Gonzalez.
“You can benefit future generations of Harvard students with the same amount of money that you would spend on three burritos,” Gonzalez added.
The following seniors were selected as members of the Senior Class Committee:
First Marshal
Berkeley E. Brown (Lowell)
Second Marshal
Wyatt M. Robertson (Quincy)
Program Marshal
Anthony X. Chen (Cabot)
Jerry G. Nelluvelil (Quincy)
William Oh (Currier)
Madeleine H. Stern (Winthrop)
Sara S. Surani (Kirkland)
Rajet Vatsa (Cabot)
Gift Marshal
Cengiz Cemaloglu (Currier)
Eduardo A. Gonzalez (Mather)
Charles S. Krumholz (Eliot)
Belle Lee (Leverett)
Allison S. Li (Lowell)
Alec K. Reed (Leverett)

Assigning male and female soldiers to the same rooms makes it more likely that male soldiers will view female soldiers as equals, Dr. Andreas Kotsadam argued at the first installment of the Gender and Security Seminar Series at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs on Friday.
Kotsadam, a senior researcher at The Frisch Centre in Oslo, Norway, conducted social experiments on the effects of shared living spaces during boot camp in the Norwegian military, randomly assigning male soldiers to share rooms with female soldiers during military training. The causal effects, he explained, were measured by a mandatory survey which was given out two times: once before boot camp, and once afterwards.
“We found that living and working with women causes men to adopt more egalitarian attitudes,” Kotsadam said.
When male soldiers shared a room with a female soldier, he said, they were more likely to select a female candidate as a troop leader, and less likely to hold negative perceptions about female soldiers’ capabilities.
This research comes in light of Norway’s extension of compulsory military service to women. Previously, only men were required to join the military, but following a policy change in 2013, women can now be drafted as well.
According to Kotsadam, his findings contradict some politicians’ arguments that men will simply leave the military if women join.
“We see that [men] are extremely happy with bootcamp…and it’s no different when they have a female on the team,” Kotsadam said.
Kotsadam, who said he was especially politically active during his “younger days,” has always been curious about gender issues and views academic research as a way to make progress towards gender equality.
“I hope that this research is showing that it is obviously possible to… causally change attitudes,” Kotsadam said. “I hope that this will affect other researchers who test that in other settings, so that we know how and when this works, and that we, in the end, can change society for the better.”
The Gender and Security Seminar Series was coordinated by Dara K. Cohen, an assistant professor of public policy at the Kennedy School whose work centers on international relations, gender, and political violence.
Cohen reflected on the need for female leadership in male-dominated settings: “I hope we are at the cusp of a big social change where we see more diversity at the highest level.”
The next speaker in the series is Ashton B. Carter, former Secretary of Defense and current director of the Belfer Center, under whom the U.S. military mandated all combat positions be open to women.
This will be the second event in the semester-long series, which is open to the public.

Boston-based bakery chain Swissbäkers plans to open another location in a renovated Smith Campus Center in 2018, pending approval from the Cambridge city government.
Swissbäkers, known for its breads, cakes, cookies, and sandwiches, already has locations in Allston, Reading, and the Boston Public Market. It also sells its products at local farmers markets on the weekends.
The bakery aims to open alongside the Smith Campus Center, located at 1350 Massachusetts Ave., after renovations on the building complete in fall 2018. In addition to the new eatery, the renovated campus center will include a remodeled plaza on Mass Ave. with increased seating and chess tables, as well as several indoor common spaces.
The new Swissbäkers location will sit along the building’s interior pedestrian arcade and plans to include outdoor seating, according to documents that Swissbakers filed with the Cambridge Zoning Board.
Swissbäkers joins several other bakeries and sandwich shops in Harvard Square, including Crema Cafe, Flour Bakery and Cafe, and Tatte. Several other business will be able to open in the renovated Smith Center.
According to the zoning document, the new Swissbäkers will sell coffee beverages, breakfast items, and pre-made sandwiches on pretzel baguettes.
The Cambridge Zoning Board will hold its next meeting on Oct. 12 to decide on the bakery’s plans.
Swissbäkers management declined to comment for this article.

Impacting investing strategist Kusi Hornberger argued that his industry suffers from systematic flaws that hinder its efficacy at a Friday afternoon seminar hosted by Harvard’s Center for International Development.
Speaking to a crowded room, Hornberger—a Kennedy School alumnus and senior project manager at Dalberg Global Development Advisors—detailed the challenges associated with fundraising and deal-making in the impact investing sector, which looks to invest in opportunities that also generate social or environmental gains.
“I would say funding sources limit innovation in deal structuring and risk-taking, in the sense that because a lot of this capital comes in with a lot of additional precedents and restrictions,” Hornberger said. “What the funds can do with this capital is actually very limited.”
Despite his qualms, Hornberger also touched on several “bright spots” in the impact investment market, where he observed the market moving towards greater democratization and clearer standards. He discussed his former employer Global Partnerships as a model.
“Every investment [we made] had an impact thesis—not just an investment thesis, but an impact thesis. That impact thesis came before we found an investment opportunity,” Hornberger said. “We went to the field and sourced the idea from the people we were already working with.”
Although Hornberger’s points found a warm reception from most of the audience, some voiced their disagreements with Hornberger in pointed questions asked throughout the hour-long event.
Mads M. Asprem, a Business School fellow and researcher in high-impact investing, found particular trouble with Hornberger’s point that without a standard career path for impact investors, the industry was deprived of experienced people.
“The industry attracts a lot of people with experience from other sectors, which I think is very positive, which he thinks is problematic, but he’s wrong about that,” Asprem said. “Impact investing should be very happy that there are people from the private equity sector, which knows this stuff, coming to the sector.”
However, many like Willene J. Johnson ’68, president of the forestry investment company Komaza, Inc., found that Hornberger’s perspective properly acknowledged impact investing’s real difficulties.
“I think he’s candid, in terms of identifying the many risks that exist and the particular challenges that face developing what is really a new approach to investment flows and development in emerging markets,” Johnson said.
Hornberger is one of several individuals invited to the Center for International Development’s speaker series to discuss their experiences working in development.
“The idea of bringing people like Kusi [to speak] is so that students and other community members have an opportunity to learn and hear from people who are working on the ground,” said P. Andrea Hayes, the Center’s events and outreach manager. “We want to bring a variety of people who can speak to different types of projects.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year after Faculty discussion formally began on Harvard’s historic penalties on final clubs and Greek organizations, two critical developments may change the nature of the debate at Tuesday’s meeting of the full Faculty.
In advance of the Faculty meeting, a committee tasked with reviewing and revising the University’s current policy—which bars students in unrecognized social organizations, starting from the class of 2021, from holding athletic team captaincies and club leadership positions or being recommended for certain postgraduate fellowships—released its final report Friday.
Committee co-chair Suzannah E. Clark, a Music professor, will present the report for discussion at the meeting. Watering down an initial proposal to ban social groups entirely, the report presents three options: maintain the current policy, ban membership altogether in unrecognized single-gender social groups, or consider a set of “some other possible solutions.”
Although Faculty will discuss the motion on Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust has the ultimate authority to choose which option to pursue. Unlike at most meetings, the Faculty will meet in the Science Center Tuesday.
But standing in the way of the committee is a contingent of Faculty members led by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68. Lewis will introduce his second anti-penalties motion Tuesday, aiming to curbing administrative power over student social life. Per Faculty meeting rules, Lewis’ motion is only up for discussion in October, and would be eligible for a vote as soon as November.
Last year, Lewis presented a similar motion. However, before votes could be cast at the December meeting, Faust abruptly cut proceedings short at the scheduled meeting end time. Lewis rescinded his motion that January after FAS Dean Michael D. Smith formed the Faculty committee.
In addition to the Lewis motion, Government professor Danielle S. Allen will present a sanctions-related motion, also up for discussion only. The motion argues that final clubs are recognized by Massachusetts as “student organizations” and that the policies of the Harvard Student Handbook should apply to members of those organizations.
In its final report, the committee was openly skeptical about the effectiveness of re-recognizing final clubs in an effort to regain administrative control.
Before any social life-related discussion, however, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith will present his annual report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will refurbish Adams House in phases over the course of three years—and all future Houses for longer than one year—due to construction complications and financial constraints, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s annual report.
In the last several years, FAS has been gradually renewing the College’s upperclassman Houses, with Adams’s renewal scheduled to begin in June 2019. While the renovations of Winthrop and Dunster Houses were completed in a year, the ongoing renovation of Lowell House is expected to take two years.
In March, Smith said that House renewal is now primarily dependent on donations and debt financing. With the University’s capital campaign approaching its end, debt has become an increasingly large part of the project’s funding.
House renewal cost $161.7 million this year, according to the report, and other refurbishments around campus accounted for 6.7 percent of the FAS budget in fiscal year 2017—well above the target renewal rate of 2.5 percent per year. As of June, Harvard Management Corporation has authorized FAS to spend a total of $873.9 million on House renewal, according to the report.
FAS receives about half of its income from the University’s endowment, so it’s been hit particularly hard by several years of lackluster returns. Last week, Harvard Management Company announced that the endowment returned a “disappointing” 8.1 percent in fiscal year 2017, though the results were a marked increase from fiscal year 2016’s negative 2 percent returns.
Because of the poor returns, “the endowment distribution remained flat for the Fiscal Year 2018 budget, producing a larger than budgeted deficit once again,” the report reads.
According to the report, the FAS budget is “extraordinarily sensitive to even small fluctuations” in the endowment. Last year, low endowment returns coupled with diminishing cash reserves led FAS to cut graduate student admissions by 4.4 percent.
The report also provides a view of the FAS “core” budget, which comprises roughly 72 percent of its total finances. In this “core” budget, FAS ran a small surplus—enough to sustain FAS for 12.4 days, according to the report—thanks in part to the refinancing of its debt.
“The level of reserves provided through the refinancing is welcome, but modest. It is well below what might be considered adequate for an entity of the FAS’s size,” the report reads. “The hope is that this action will buy time for the needed investments to be made and other budgetary remedies to develop.”
FAS debt still totals in excess of $1 billion dollars. The FAS endowment is now worth approximately $15.9 billion.
Despite setbacks, FAS finished the fiscal year with a “significantly smaller” deficit than expected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council agreed to provide $1,075 for a mental health-themed student event through the Council’ $30,000 “Grant for an Open Harvard College,” marking the first time the fund has been used to directly help bring a speaker to campus.
The Green Ribbon Club, a student organization concerned with mental health advocacy, hopes to bring “Pretty Little Liars” actress Troian A. Bellisario—who recently opened up about her struggles with mental illness—to campus. Part of the funding will go towards her travel and accommodations.
Student Initiatives Committee Chair Alexander Popovski ’18 said he encouraged debate on the unprecedented funding of Bellisario’s potential visit.
“We’re going to be covering seven hundred dollars worth on the speaker through travel and accommodations. This would be the first time ever doing this through GOHC,” he said.
Launched in 2016, GOHC funds student-driven initiatives involving the Council’s “compelling interests”: mental health, race, culture, and faith relations, sexual assault and harassment prevention, social spaces, and financial accessibility.
Winthrop House Representative Henry S. Atkins ’20 said he wanted to make sure Council members were aware of the example this funding would set for future grant applications.
“Are we prepared for the precedent that this could set without clear guidelines surrounding this in the future?” he said. “What if someone...suggests bringing in a speaker whom we feel may not make people welcome on this campus?”
Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said each speaker must be judged independently of one another.
“I think we just need to exercise our own judgement in each individual case,” he said. “I don’t think anyone should apply to the UC expecting that we’re going to give them thousands of dollars to bring in a guest speaker.”
The grant was approved. Afterwards, UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 introduced a bill seeking $500 compensation for Vojtech Drmota ’20, who helped build the Q Guide for comps unveiled earlier this year.
Sachee said the compensation for Drmota was significantly more cost-effective than outsourcing the work to a professional organization.
“It was far, far below what... it would actually cost if we had done it with a real company,” she said, estimating that Drmota would be paid about 5 percent of a professional’s compensation.
After Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 asked if the duo thought about formalizing payments to contractors in the bylaws, Khansarinia said he hopes to formally implement an earnings system.
Taylor Marquis ’19 cautioned the UC against funding a payment installment plan “retroactively,” as it leaves the Council with “essentially no choice.”
Ultimately, the legislation passed by unanimous consent. Looking ahead, the UC’s leaders mentioned that they will meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Monday. The UC’s next meeting will occur on Monday, October 9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After facing widespread criticism for inviting—and then disinviting—Chelsea Manning as a visiting fellow this month, the Kennedy School of Government has decided to reassess how it uses that term and may not bestow it upon invited guests like Manning in the future.
In an emailed statement, Harvard Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote that the School is “working to better understand our current practices for applying the term 'Fellow', and to establish consistent standards across the School.”
The reevaluation comes weeks after commentators across the country attacked the Kennedy School’s selection of fellows for the fall semester. To start, conservatives and national security officials criticized the IOP for appointing Manning, a former US army soldier and transgender rights advocate, who was convicted of leaking several thousand classified documents to WikiLeaks as a fellow.
The day after announcing the appointment, HKS senior fellow and former CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell resigned and CIA Director Mike Pompeo did not show up at a speaking engagement at the IOP—both in protest of the IOP hiring Manning. They argued that naming Manning a fellow implicitly endorsed her actions.
Hours later, the IOP withdrew Manning’s offer, sparking an aftershock of national criticism from those who defended Manning. Hundreds of alumni also signed a letter sent to University President Drew G. Faust and Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, lambasting them for giving fellowships to Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer, two prominent former staffers for President Donald Trump.
In an interview Wednesday, Faust said that Elmendorf “wants to scrutinize [the title] much more carefully.” Elmendorf, when announcing that Manning’s fellowship was rescinded, conceded that he had underestimated the honorific the “fellow” title connoted.
“We did not intend to honor her in any way or to endorse any of her words or deeds, as we do not honor or endorse any Fellow,” Elmendorf wrote in the letter announcing his decision to rescind Manning’s invitation to be a fellow at the school. “I see more clearly now that many people view a Visiting Fellow title as an honorific, so we should weigh that consideration when offering invitations.”
Elmendorf declined to comment for this article through a Kennedy School spokesperson.
Faust stressed that the decision about which fellows to invite or disinvite rests with the Kennedy School, not the University's central administration.
“Those kinds of decisions come through processes within the schools,” Faust said. “I think [Elmendorf’s] arguments about [Spicer and Lewandowski] have been that these are two individuals who played rather prominent roles and have made substantive contributions, had substantive influences on the government, and therefore are people who would have something to communicate to an audience at the Kennedy School."
Administrators have enlisted students and faculty to assist in determining who the school should bring to campus and what titles they are given.
“We have been consulting faculty, students and staff in numerous meetings over the past two weeks. We will continue these consultations as we develop standards and procedures for future appointments of Fellows across the Kennedy School,” Gavel wrote. “We hope to have an improved approach in place later this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Honor Council heard twice as many cases concerning “inappropriate collaboration” in the 2016-2017 academic year as it did the year before, according to the body’s second-ever annual report released Monday.
The Council—which adjudicates academic dishonesty at the College—heard 128 cases in total, a slight increase from the 115 it heard last year. The uptick in inappropriate collaboration comes the same year that a cheating scandal in Harvard’s flagship introductory computer science course swept campus: More than 10 percent of 2016 fall enrollees in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” appeared before the Council last semester.
In its report, the Honor Council obliquely referenced CS50, writing in a footnote that “one large introductory course” had skewed the data for last year.
“In 2016-2017, the Honor Council received a significant number of reports from one large introductory course,” the footnote reads. “The Council works to protect the privacy of students and does not report on cases by individual courses, but the impact of the reports from this one course is evident in the statistics that follow.”
The footnote mentioned that the number of cases per class year, as well as the number of cases per academic discipline, were the two “areas of measurement” most “significantly impacted” by the unnamed introductory course.
The number of freshmen appearing before the Council doubled from the previous year, rising from roughly 24 to 49. In the 2015-2016 academic year, then-sophomores—members of the Class of 2018—were most likely to be investigated. This past year, though, then-freshmen—members of the Class of 2020—were most likely to be investigated.
CS50 was 53 percent freshmen in fall 2016, according to data provided by course head instructor David J. Malan ’99.
For the second year in a row, the vast majority of academic dishonesty cases occurred in courses offered in the Sciences Division or by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. CS50 falls under the the latter category.
In an interview Friday, Honor Council secretary Brett Flehinger declined to comment on whether the marked increases in inappropriate collaboration cases and in freshman cases were due to cheating in CS50 last fall, citing concerns over “confidentiality” and student privacy.
But he suggested looking at the footnote about the introductory course in particular when trying to interpret the Council’s academic dishonesty data.
“We don’t talk about individual courses, but we do have a footnote in there that says we got a lot of reports from one large introductory course, and you can draw the conclusions that you will,” he said. “One of the reasons we put that in there is that it does shift the stats, [so] we’re open about that.”
Following the cheating scandal, some CS50 students charged that the course’s collaboration policy for problem sets—summarized as “be reasonable”—was too vague and led to unintentional violations by enrollees. The Council’s final report particularly focused on academic dishonesty cases arising from “problem sets and collaboration issues” and offered three recommendations to rectify the issue.
The Council proposed that Harvard consider an “educational campaign” to remind students about collaboration policies, that faculty “revise and improve” their collaboration policies, and that the College “refine” the language it offers to faculty on collaboration. Malan made a number of changes to CS50 this year, including requiring enrollees to attend two orientation meetings where course staff offered advice on how to navigate issues of academic integrity.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris attended at least one of these sessions and implored students not to cheat, asserting that “no one should leave this room not understanding 100 percent what it is that you may and may not do in this course.”
Out of all cases reviewed by the Council in 2016-2017, the body found that roughly three-quarters of students investigated had violated the College’s Honor Code—roughly the same percentage as in 2015-2016. In total, 47 percent of all students who appeared before the Council were found responsible for an academic violation that resulted in a “change in status,” with punitive measures ranging from academic probation to temporary withdrawal from the College. In 2015-2016, 44 percent of those investigated suffered a change in status.
Twenty-four students—roughly nineteen percent of all cases—were asked to take time away from Harvard in 2016-2017, an increase from the 14 students and 12 percent of cases who were asked to do so last year.
Flehinger declined to answer a question asking how many of the students asked to withdraw were CS50 enrollees.
“The minute a course gets named, any student who is involved in that course… immediately thinks the comment is aimed at them,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After defeating Holy Cross in a Wednesday night road game, 7-0, the No. 14 Harvard field hockey team (8-2, 1-0 Ivy) returned home to Berylson Field to face off against Penn on Saturday. (4-5, 1-1 Ivy).
Despite facing off against a Quakers team that had won four out of its last five games, the Crimson relied on its stingy defense and potent attack to emerge with a comprehensive 6-0 victory. With the result, Harvard extends its winning streak to six games. Over this span, the Crimson has outscored its opponents by a 31-5 margin.
On a day where six different players each scored one goal for Harvard, sophomore Maddie Earle got the action started in the 8th minute. After coming on as a substitute in the 6th minute, freshman forward Tessel Huibregsten played a pass that was redirected to Earle, who shot from the nearside for the opening goal.
In the 18th minute, junior forward Kathleen Young collected the ball from 30 yards out. After making a run towards goal, she fired her shot from a tight angle past the Penn goalkeeper for the score. The goal, Young’s 8th of the year, extended her scoring streak to seven games. During her personal streak, Young has scored 17 points on the strength of 7 goals and 2 assists.
“Kathleen can change the entire game with the unique energy that she brings,” sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen said. “She could just take the ball, beat the defender to the circle for the score, and get the team into the flow that we need. The energy she brings and the way she speeds up our play is so incredibly important and so beautiful to see. This weekend, she showed how amazing she is.”
In the 27th minute, co-captain and midfielder Ellie Cookson scored her first goal of the season on a turnaround shot near goal. Then, freshman forward Mimi Tarrant closed out the Crimson’s high scoring first half with her goal off a reverse stick shot in the 35th minute. Tarrant, who now has tallied 17 points on the season, leads all Ivy League freshmen in the category.
By going into the half up by four goals, Harvard continued its recent trend of starting games with an unrelenting attack. Over the course of its six game win streak, the Crimson has scored an average of 2.6 goals with an average of 7.3 shots in the first half.
“What we try to do is make a statement,” van Vlijmen said. “Our focus is to start off really hard and get either a corner or a goal in the first five minutes. We want that aggressive start. If you don’t bring that intensity in the first five minutes, it won’t be there for the rest of the game.”
The second half saw the home team continue to put on a strong offensive display. In the 48th minute, van Vlijmen scored off of a penalty corner to extend Harvard’s lead to 5-0. In the 62nd minute, senior midfielder Emily Ott scored her first goal of the season to cap off the Crimson’s offensive outburst.
In addition to a strong offensive effort, Harvard relied once again on its back line to get a decisive result. The team outshot Penn 17-5, with the Quakers failing to register a single shot on target. As for penalty corners, the Crimson only conceded one while taking 8 of its own. Junior goalkeeper Libby Manela earned her third win of the season and her second shutout with the result.
Harvard hopes to continue its strong run of play when it returns to action on Friday against Brown. While the Bears do enter with a losing record, they remain a dangerous opponent, one the Crimson will have to overcome on its quest for an Ivy League title.
“Our method is to take it game by game, and approach each game as we prepare for whoever it is,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “If we keep doing the right things and keep developing ourselves, then we will put ourselves in a great position to be successful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Riding a five-game winning streak entering this past weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (8-4, 3-0 Ivy League) continued rolling against Ivy League competition as it overcame Cornell (5-7, 1-2) on Friday night and Columbia (5-7, 0-3) on Saturday in front of two capacity crowds at the Malkin Athletic Center.
“We were able to defend the home court,” sophomore hitter Grace Roberts Burbank said. “We’re getting better each day. Each point, we’re learning something new and developing as a team.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
On Saturday evening, the Crimson displayed its ability to dominate opponents, quickly taking care of business against a battered Lions team.
Columbia was on the second leg of a New England road trip and coming off two straight Ivy League losses. The day before, it fell in three sets to Dartmouth, a team that Harvard dismantled in four sets last weekend. The Lions mustered only 30 points in those three sets.
Against the Crimson, Columbia put up more of a fight. The team battled hard in the second set even after falling flat in the first, 25-14 .
The intense back-and-forth in the first half of the second set brought the crowd energy into play, and Harvard made use of a strong series of in-game adjustments to ultimately pull ahead for good.
“Our big focus for us this match was proving that we could take care of their second set,” junior middle blocker Jocelyn Meyer said. “In this match we proved to ourselves that we can handle that. Columbia was switching up all of their hitters so we had to work on switching up our defense a little bit. As long as we were playing our game, we were able to keep going strong.”
The third set was the tightest one of the match, as the two squads battled to 20-20 with nothing to separate them. An ace from sophomore setter Erin McCarthy gave the Crimson a slim lead, and it would not look back as three different players recorded kills for Harvard to bring the team within one point of victory.
After the Lions battled off one set point, a service error by sophomore setter Grace Campbell doomed them to defeat.
“There were definitely improvements [from the Cornell game],” Burbank said. “Now we are 3-0 in the Ivies and are going to take on Penn and Princeton at their home courts. We are going in with confidence.”
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
The night before, the Crimson found itself in a more closely contested battle with the Big Red. Harvard raced into the lead with a comfortable win the first set, 25-18, but Cornell battled back to take the second set, 25-21, to notch things at one set apiece.
In the crucial third set, the Crimson went on a 5-0 run early on to take a 7-4 lead. It never relinquished the advantage and went on to take the set, 25-20.
On the brink of defeat, the Big Red once again proved tough to finish off in the fourth set, forcing nine ties. Down to its last point at 24-20, the team fought off four set points to tie the score at 24-24.
As she has done multiple times in her career, however, Harvard junior middle blocker and co-captain Christina Cornelius took over. She tallied two straight kills to stave off the Cornell comeback and secure the win for the Crimson.
With the 3-1 victory, Harvard claimed its first 2-0 start to an Ivy League campaign since 2004.
Burbank notched a team-high 14 kills alongside Cornelius, and sophomore setter Erin McCarthy also proved crucial as she recorded a team-leading 40 assists to go along with 12 digs. Cornelius, with 11 kills against the Big Red and 7 against Columbia, continues to lead the team in total kills with 118.
Following its two wins, the Crimson sit undefeated at the top of the conference standings, but so does Princeton, setting up a big clash next weekend in New Jersey.
“That’s going to be our big motivation in practice this week: to stay at the top of the Ivy League.” Meyer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

With one strike of the foot by freshman midfielder Cornelius Bencsik, the struggles of the past 80 minutes and the entire first half of the season washed away for Harvard men’s soccer.
Entering hostile territory in New Haven, Conn., the Crimson (2-5-1, 1-0-0 Ivy League) rallied from a goal down to snatch a crucial victory against Yale (3-5-0, 0-1-0) as the teams embark on a new Ancient Eight season.
Harvard had lost three straight entering Saturday and had been shutout for more than 180 minutes. The team seemed destined to drop another game as the Bulldogs went into the final ten minutes with a one-goal lead, courtesy of a 29th minute finish by freshman forward Aldo Quevado.
Bad luck and missed chances seemed to bite the Crimson once again—a deflected clearance by sophomore defensive midfielder Joel Serugo gave Yale the tap-in lead.
That lead lasted until Bencsik struck a volley from the edge of the penalty box to bring the game back to square one. The Bulldog defense struggled to clear a long throw-in from Serugo and the Norwegian midfielder rocketed the loose ball into the back of the net.
Almost exactly four minutes later, senior midfielder Christian Sady drove another shot past Yale junior goalkeeper Kees Schipper, whose sprawling effort and partial deflection could not keep out the go-ahead goal.
These two finishes clinched a much-needed win as Harvard plunges into its tough conference schedule. Bencsik’s tally materialized the efforts of a hard-fought game in which just five shots were put on frame and four yellow cards were handed out. It also seemed to catalyze an offense that had scored just four goals in seven games.
“There were quite a few momentum swings throughout the game, but overall we fought extremely hard and we fought as a team,” co-captain and defender Justin Cricklow said. “That’s something that we’ve been struggling with throughout the season, but in this game we showed that we had a lot of grit.”
Success seems to act as a stabilizing force as the Crimson looks to build momentum. Sady’s finish may serve as the winner to a game that ultimately turns around Harvard’s season.
“I think that we’ve been a lot closer to winning other games, and yesterday it just felt like a huge weight had been taken off our shoulders because we were able to get the win,” Cricklow said.
Indeed, the Crimson found itself in a difficult situation on Saturday. The team faced a jeering crowd at the Bulldogs’ Reese Stadium, and conditions only got worse when Quevado gave the home team an early lead to work with.
“Whenever you go up to Yale, it’s a really tough game and there’s a lot of emotion around the first Ivy League game,” Sady said. “There’s a lot of intensity and I thought we did a good job and I thought that we handled it really well.”
The Bulldogs controlled possession for much of the first half, occupying Harvard’s defensive third and winning four corner kicks. But senior goalkeeper Kyle Parks and the Crimson’s defense limited the damage to just one goal. This strong play allowed the offense to find its feet in the second half and to ultimately outshoot Yale.
“It all came down to us working harder than them for the entire 90 minutes and I think that’s how we are going to find our success moving forward as well,” Cricklow said. “There were definitely parts of the game that we can improve. It wasn’t a perfect game by any means, but we worked harder than them and that’s how we won.”
The hard work certainly paid dividends in the game, but Saturday’s success also marks progress in terms of team building.
“We’ve had different players in the starting lineup for the past few games, and just finding that rhythm and seeing who plays best with who,” Cricklow said. “I think we started to get an indication of that yesterday and just building that team chemistry and on-the-field chemistry is huge for us.”
During the team’s slow start, in which Harvard won just one of seven games, it might have been hard to see how the team was coming together. But perhaps the non-conference games were just a symptom of slow development.
“I am continuing to look forward to watching up come together as a team in time of adversity,” Sady said. “So when we are down goals in games, how we respond to that. If we lose a game in the Ivy League, how we respond to that. It’s my hope that we won’t cave in and we will come around each other, and I know we will.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its Ivy League opener on Sunday, Harvard women’s rugby rolled past Brown in a comfortable, 84-8 win in Providence, R.I. The Crimson maintained its unbeaten record on the season, improving to 3-0-1, while also edging past the Bears (0-2-0) in their all-time tally, which now sits at 7-6-1 in Harvard’s favor.
Though not as lopsided as last Friday’s game against Mt. St. Mary’s, which finished 130-0, the Crimson never really seemed troubled by Brown, and the scoreline very much reflected that. Harvard maintained the bulk of the possession throughout the game, and dictated the pace and intensity of the contest from start to finish.
Three tries shortly after kickoff put the Crimson in the driver’s seat early on, where it remained without much resistance. Junior Genevieve Quirion opened the scoring, and was followed by two tries in rapid succession by sophomore Brooklynn Davis. Davis, one of nine scorers for Harvard, finished the game with three tries.
“I think we played pretty well today. We were working on some new attack stuff, trying to really shore up our attack,” sophomore Dominique Cantave said. “We executed really well, listening to one another and connecting really well.”
Harvard kept a shutout for the first half, heading into the break leading 44-0.  This gave the team an opportunity to experiment and work on new techniques with the game already in hand.
“It was definitely a team effort, I think everybody played well today,” Cantave said. “We got to have a lot of our walk-ons come out and play for the first time today, and get their first tackles in today, so it was definitely a team effort.”
“This week we focused a lot on dominating at the tackle, making sure that we’re really bringing people down on defense, and clearing people out on offense,” Cantave added. “We really just wanted to be powerful and intense after tackles, which I think we did really well. This gave us a lot faster play, and allowed us to keep possession for most of the game.”
The Crimson has been exceptional on both sides of the field this year, producing both electrifying offense and lockdown defense.  Harvard has scored 308 points this year, while only allowing 41, recording two shutouts in its four games. Early on in 2017, the Crimson has consistently run up the score on its opponents, and it will be looking to continue putting up big numbers as it moves towards the end of the season.
Harvard will face arguably its toughest test of the season this coming Saturday when it hosts Dartmouth at Mignone Field. Dartmouth is 3-0 this season, but it has yet to play away from home. The Crimson will then round out the regular season when it plays host to Princeton on October 14th, again at Mignone Field.
“We’re definitely super excited to play Dartmouth,” freshman Erin Wright said. “They’re a very good team, and we’re looking forward to a challenge. We’re hoping to come out ready to go.”
“We’re definitely thinking about Ivies, obviously our goal is to go there and do well and play well, but we try to take things week by week, and grow every single week, which leads into the bigger matches toward the end of the season,” Wright said.
After the two conference showdowns with the Big Green and the Tigers, all eyes will turn to the Ivy League Championships, which begin on October 28th. Harvard will be looking to make amends this year after falling 14-5 in last year’s final against Dartmouth. Despite the desire to win the title in a month’s time, the team is set on taking things slowly and not taking any opponents for granted.

The Harvard sailing team saw mercurial weather in the past weekend’s four regattas, and emerged with mixed results overall.
The Crimson split four events across the Northeast, with the Harvard Invitational at home, the George Warren Smith Trophy at MIT, the Regis Bowl hosted by Boston University, and the Rogers Trophy at Cornell. Rain and wind played havoc over the course of some of the two-day regattas.
The Harvard Invitational was the sailing team’s second home regatta of the fall. Harvard took fifth place by a wide margin, but came in 16 points short of Brown in fourth. With the finish, the Crimson edged out Bates College and Emmanuel College, amongst others.
At MIT’s regatta, Harvard placed sixth through Saturday’s showers and Sunday’s fair weather. The Smith Trophy is notable for being the only event in college sailing where teams compete in tech dinghies, which have one sail as opposed to two. But the Charles River proved to be more of a factor in the results of this regatta than its unusual boats.
“[On] the Charles River, the wind can be quite shifty and quite random,” junior Andrew Puopolo said. “So it’s pretty important to keep your head out of the boat and [keep] a good attitude.”
Meanwhile, members of the women’s team placed eighth at the Rogers Trophy, hosted by Cornell. Weather conditions at Cayuga Lake, N.Y., were the opposite of those on the Charles: competitors faced clear skies on Saturday, and a sudden, windless chill on Sunday. The Crimson’s finish came off a head-to-head tiebreaker against Northwestern and Tufts, both of which totaled 145 points.
Harvard had an 11th place finish at BU’s women-only Regis Bowl. Both the Crimson and Bowdoin College ended the day with 153 points, with Harvard eventually edging out the Polar Bears in the tiebreaker. Once again, conditions allowed for far less than smooth sailing.
“The wind velocity really varied,” said sophomore Jessica Williams. “With that, there came a lot of wind shifts. And then [on Sunday], on the river, it was just really light and very shifty. So, boat speed was really important.”
The Regis Bowl wasn’t a qualifier and thus didn’t have much bearing on the team’s position for the rest of the season. Nevertheless, the Crimson wasn’t pleased with an 11th place finish in a field of 16 teams.
“We wish we would’ve done a little bit better this weekend,” said Williams. “But they were tough conditions, so we did the best that we could.”
Williams thinks, though, that there are some lessons to be learned from the weekend for all of Harvard’s sailors.
“It was a good weekend to get out on the water and practice some of the things that we’re working on,” she said. “[That] will hopefully help us in later regattas.”
Sailing returns to action next weekend as it travels to Bowdoin for the Barnett trophy and to the University of Rhode Island for the Moody Trophy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard-Yale rivalry felt the extra weight of a must-win conference game on Saturday night.
In a hard-fought battle, the Crimson women’s soccer team dropped its second straight Ivy League matchup, coming up short against the Bulldogs in New Haven, 3-0. Yale (7-3-1, 1-1-0 Ivy League) held Harvard (6-5-1, 0-2-0) at bay to effectively dash the visitor’s hopes of defending its Ancient Eight title.
In a defensive struggle, the winner was predictably decided at the very end of the game.
In an attempt to knot up the score, facing a 1-0 deficit for most of the game, the Crimson took some offensive risks as the clock wound down. The all-or-nothing play-style ultimately led to two goals from the Bulldogs that sealed the game’s fate.
“I think the turning point was when we upped the tempo and created chances to take some risks,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said.
These risks, however, proved fruitless, as the Crimson was shut out for the second straight game. Yale’s stellar goalkeeping kept Harvard scoreless, as Bulldogs sophomore goalie Alyssa Fagel posted a career-high nine saves on as many shots on goal.
The Crimson had 17 shots to Yale’s 18, but the Bulldogs were able to net a pair of goals in the waning minutes of the game to pull away. The two teams were separated by one goal in all but the final nine minutes of the game.
“We created enough chances to tie and take the game at the end,” Hamblin said. “We generated the most shots we’ve had all year.”
Harvard pounded the Bulldog defense with shots all night despite Yale’s exceptional work at goalkeeper. Crimson junior defender Leah Mohammadi attempted a team-high seven shots, with four of these on goal, but was unable to find the back of the net.
“We had a really good 20 to 30 minute stretch in the second half where we were putting them under pressure,” senior co-captain Marie Becker said.
On the other end, the Harvard defense faced equally heavy pressure. The Bulldogs’ offense attempted 18 shots, keeping the foot on the pedal for the entire game.
In addition, Yale earned nine corner kicks, four in the first half and five in the second half, bombarding the Crimson from a multitude of set pieces. Harvard, on the other hand, did not earn a single corner kick in the entire contest.
The Crimson also split time between two goalies, giving each one half to play. Junior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel played the first half, with sophomore goalie Kat Hess finishing off the final 45 minutes of the contest.
The pair of Harvard goalkeepers was able to hold off the Bulldogs for most of the game, but the dicey offensive risks taken by the Crimson at the end of the contest left its defense vulnerable to a Yale attack.
“We started playing faster and chasing and the last 15 minutes, we opened up our back line,” Becker said.
The Bulldogs took advantage of its opponent’s attack-minded strategy , netting two late goals off of a pass to the front of the box and a free kick, respectively.
The importance of the game was felt by everyone present in Reese Stadium.
“This game was a big matchup, really the team that was going to take the game tonight was going to take control of the Ivy race,” Hamblin said.
Harvard continues to look ahead to the future, hoping to fine-tune its game where needed while capitalizing on its strengths.
“It was difficult for us to consistently keep the tempo that we wanted to keep,” Coach Hamblin said.
The tempo was a key of the game Saturday night, but the fast pace and high shot total did not result in the necessary chances to put the Crimson on the scoreboard.
That is not to say that the many offensive opportunities were not a bright spot for Harvard.
“Unfortunately we weren’t able to take the game, but I’m really proud of the effort and the way that we played,” Hamblin said.
Ultimately, the attack the Crimson put forth were not enough for it to top its rival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an eight-game winning streak going into the weekend, the No. 11 Harvard men’s water polo looked to continue its winning ways. However, the streak went south as the Crimson dropped two close contests against Princeton and St. Francis, each by two goals. Harvard ended the weekend on a high note by soundly defeating Iona, finishing the weekend 1-2.
PRINCETON 11, HARVARD 9
In its first match of the weekend, Harvard fell to Princeton, 11-9. The Crimson trailed the Tigers for most of the game and fell behind, 5-2, at the half.
“We didn’t match their intensity in the first quarter, and they jumped on us,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I felt that we had to play from behind and it was a great crowd, and they played really well.”
However, down by four goals late in the fourth quarter, Harvard had a late surge. The team scored four goals in quick succession, three coming from freshman Dennis Blyashov, to pull even with Princeton, 9-9. However, a strike from the right from Tiger All-American Matt Payne with less than a minute left sealed the game for Princeton, which emerged victorious.
“We got out to kind of a slow start and then we were really just trying to battle back throughout the game,” sophomore Austen Sechrest said. “So I think our team showed a lot of heart to tie it back at 9-9 in the fourth quarter.”
Two Harvard players accumulated hat tricks, Blyashov and senior captain Colin Chiapello. Junior goalkeeper Anthony Ridgley had 11 saves in the net.
ST. FRANCIS 13, HARVARD 11
In the morning game on Sunday, Harvard again started off slowly. A quick Terrier goal from Nikita Prokhin 36 seconds into the contest marked the early energy of the St. Francis squad. The Crimson trailed the terriers at the half, 13-9, and was not able to come back after scoring two more goals in the second half, losing 13-11.
“I didn’t think we stuck to our game plan very well in the first game against St. Francis,” Minnis said, “and we let them dictate the tempo and pace of the game, and we played catch-up again from behind.”
For the Terriers, William Lapkin accumulated a game-high six goals, and freshman goalie Finn Doerries saved a penalty shot as the game wound down.
Harvard was led again by Blyashov, who scored five goals. Sophomore goalkeeper Nikhil Suri entered the game in the second half and made six saves between the posts to keep the game close.
HARVARD 13, IONA 9
After two disappointing performances, the Crimson picked up its intensity in its final match of the weekend against Iona, jumping out to quick start with four goals in the first quarter.
“We knew it was going to be a tough challenge,” Sechrest said. “We had seen their results, and they have definitely improved a lot, but we really didn’t want to end the weekend 0 and 3, so we just went out there. We wanted to start off the game strong because the first two games of the weekend, we were down 6-2 in both games, and for the last game of the weekend, we wanted to jump out to strong start.”
Blyashov continued his torrid scoring pace, recording seven goals. Sechrest led the team defensively with five steals.  Suri, starting in net, made 11 saves on the way to victory.
Minnis said that the team “can’t worry about what the past is” and must “focus on and getting better” in preparation for pivotal matchups against Brown and MIT next week. Next week marks Harvard’s home-opener.
“We’re looking forward to this week of practice because we know we have a lot to work on after this weekend,” Sechrest said. “So, it’s a good wake up call, and we’re going to get back in the pool tomorrow and be ready to work hard.”

So we told you how not to be the worst punchee ever (and we hope you listened). Now we’ve got some things to say to the people on the other side of the process: the punchers. We understand that it must be a fun power trip to have hundreds of eager sophomores bending to your will, but please, keep it cool.
Stopping mid-conversation to take notes on a punchee
We don’t need more reminders that it is your job to judge us. Please don’t pull out your phone randomly to take a few notes on us. If you really were just “trying to get to know us,”you wouldn’t need a record of our outfits.
Making speeches about ~inclusion~
An inclusive punch process is an oxymoron. If we wanted inclusion, we’d go to Khurana’s suggested Chaucer readings. Everyone knows that final clubs aren’t exactly the home of inclusivity, so stop pretending. Cut it out with the speeches. We’re not buying it.
Faking coolness for six weeks
It can’t be a coincidence that your rowdiest weeks of the year just happen to overlap with punch. We know you want us to think that you’re extra cool so that we join. But please, do us a favor and give us realistic expectations for the rest of the year. This is Harvard: We don’t expect you to party five nights a week, and we don’t even want to join if that’s your regular thing.
Apologetic emails to announce cuts
We know it’s not “just a numbers thing.” You’re not letting us down any easier by adding a GIF into your rejection email. Again, we didn’t start this process with expectations of all-inclusive love and belonging. We’ll get the message if we don’t get an aggressive knock on our doors followed by a letter.
These may seem like some big asks. After all, punch is a rude process on the whole. But we would really appreciate it if you did your part to make this campus a little less insane this month. If you catch yourself in any of these situations, keep your ears open for a: dude, that’s rude.
