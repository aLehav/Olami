After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone and their mother has an opinion on the newest album, movie, and art exhibit. But what about the things that we see every day, around Harvard and the Square? Shouldn't you have an opinion about those, too? To this end, the Campus Critic from the Arts Board is here to tell you what to think.
Time is meaningless as we are all rocketing speedily towards death. However, in the finite time we have left, clocks are arguably important. They police us for crimes of not fitting into the time fabric of our fellow sacks of meat. It's not presumptuous to say that public clocks are a prime supporter of Calvinistic death-ground—an even better reminder of mortality than your crackle-kinked ankles and inability to pull as many all-nighters as you did in high school.
Harvard Square has several of these heretofore-named "Death Reminders." The Campus Critic has evaluated their existence to remind you of the meaninglessness of your own.
The Cambridge Savings Clock, 1374 Mass. Ave.
For a select number of people who think it's cute to say they no longer can read an analog clock, this enormous digital clock only needs an alarm for it to ascend to the artistic heights of being the best reminder of the short duration of our lives. If only it had a chime on the hour—perhaps akin to the one on the iPhone that's like a "Metroid" sound effect, or perhaps a German-accented voice reading imperative statements such as "Stop being late," and "Another hour of your meaningless life has passed." 8 Sturms/10 Drang
St. Paul Catholic Church, 29 Mt. Auburn St.
Scientists can never agree on what the average human attention span is. For the sake of the argument to follow, I posit 15 minutes. How convenient, then, that the clock at St. Paul's Catholic Church rings in various stages of completion every fifteen minutes, reminiscent of that joke about having four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three at night (answer: Man! Haha! Why aren't you laughing?!). What a fantastic artistic representation to have the chimes become more aesthetically perfect as we move along the 15, 30, 45, and 60 minute markers—only to start again like an optimistically oscillating universe. 9 Danses/10 Macabres
Massachusetts Hall
This is one of those clocks that looks more like a sundial than a testament to human technological innovation (not to say that sundials don't have their place). How appropriate considering we shall all turn to dust and the lowest denominator in the run-up to glorious species death! Its inaccuracy coupled with its lack of a face brings to bear the true nature of the ontological God—ineffable and has something to do with Faust. 5 egos/10 Arcadias
Lamppost Clocks Around the COOP and Market
While the time they keep might not be the most realistic of artistic endeavors, it's nice to have a clock that is just standing in the middle of the sidewalk. No craning to look at a place that worships God or money (or in the case of Mass. Hall, both). No awkward ruffling through a purse to find a phone. No laboriously pulling up your sleeve to only sigh in frustration at your unreadable analog watch. It's just in front of you. Like Death. 1 Light, not at the end of the tunnel

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there has ever been a band that has traversed all genres of music, it is Café Tacvba. (The ‘v’, pronounced like a ‘u’, is in place to avoid copyright issues with the café the band named itself after.) For over two decades the band has experimented with electronica, punk, ska, hip-hop, rock, and even regional Mexican styles like bolero and ranchera. The wide variety of experience they’ve acquired by testing all out of these styles has led to both hits and misses, and for now they’ve landed on a psychedelic and warped electronic-rock sound. On the strong but sometimes uneven “El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco,” Café Tacvba conveys their trippy, folkloric rock sound through powerful vocals, distorted electronic sounds, and precisely pitched guitar that all exemplify the band’s multi-faceted personality.
A very distinct and critical part of the band’s sound is Rubén Isaac Albarrán Ortega’s impressive vocal range. Ortega manages to hit rugged low sounds, smoother higher notes, and everything in between. On “Zopilotes,” his voice is especially powerful on strong, high notes held over long periods of time. When he sings, “They followed him with fear / With so much fear,” his voice moves up and down gracefully and passionately. Ortega’s voice takes on a new edge in “Volcán” as it is warped to create a trippy, psychedelic feel. Although at points Ortega is muffled by heavy electronic synthesizer sounds or by a rough and funky bass line, he largely overcomes these deficiencies.
On “El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco,” Café Tacvba maintains their quintessential blend of electronica and rock and are generally successful. Many of the songs begin with heavy, solid beats common in house music and electronic genres. But sharp guitar riffs then join these beats in Café Tacvba style, and the electronica and rock influences mesh to create a bold, full sound. However, this array of synthesizers, sonics effects, drums, and melodies is at times overwhelming, and what should be a powerful wall of sound turns into a loud buzzing that is far too busy to make any sense of, like in parts of “Andamios” and “De Este Lado del Camino.”
Some of the album’s most interesting songs find a unique balance between electronic and folkloric music. On “Espuma,” maracas and bongos are combined with a heavy guitar and a reverbing production to create a folkloric, tropical atmosphere with a rock tinge, demonstrating the band’s willingness to expand to different genres. The only thing that seems out of place in the song is the deep, belching bass that sounds like a mixture of a much less intense version of what is normally heard in dubstep and a typical funk bass line. However, it is better to see Café Tacvba experimenting than keeping within the constraints of a single genre.
Café Tacvba is less successful when attempting a psychedelic, ambient, light rock sound. In songs like “Pájaro,” there aren’t many build-ups, drops, or distinct developments. It’s a bit disappointing to have this lack of ups and downs, especially since the electronic sound that the band draws from depends on these dynamic changes. Most listeners would expect to hear some sort of climax, but “Pájaro” just maintains a steady rhythm and leaves much to be desired.
However, the band manages to surpass their few misses with many songs that are strong enough to be hits. “Aprovéchate,” for example, has a strong and catchy rhythmic guitar that matches up well with Ortega’s strong vocals. On this song and the whole album, Café Tacvba proves that they know the electronica genre well and that they have the musical talent and knowledge to combine it with rock and, on top of it all, to pay tribute to their Mexican roots.

When people ask me what I did with my gap year, I usually allude to “a bunch of little things, no single big trip or anything.” If they ask me where I worked, I’ll say, “odd jobs, the last one was at a café near my house.” Rarely, if ever, do I mention the time from April to June of 2010.
It was past the halfway point in my first year after high school and, though I’d been struggling to find work since January, I still didn’t want to turn in the Starbucks applications I had filled out. Which was, conveniently, an easy conversation starter with my casual acquaintances­­—most people understand when a college-aged person talks about looking for work, and understand all the more when he’s having trouble finding it. My neighbor is not most people, however, and when I told him of my employment woes, he immediately invited me to work for him. “Of course, man,” he told me, "It’ll be fun."
I was thrilled. My mom, less so. You see, work would not be waiting tables, or washing dishes, or even filing papers. Work would be leaving for the office at 10:00 p.m. and coming home around 5:00 or 6:00 a.m., depending on the crowd. Work would be preventing drunk patrons from manhandling the performers (unless the performers specifically wanted them to). Work would be fetching drinks for whichever celebrity had stopped by for the evening and, in the process, picking up a little something for myself.
My neighbor owns a burlesque nightclub, one known for its expensive taste and exclusive crowd. Within the week, I started work as a stagehand in the East Village of New York at the ripe, innocent age of 18.
The burlesque scene is not one that I would have sought out on my own. I didn’t even truly know what burlesque meant when I was first hired on, though Wikipedia told me that “Burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects,” which didn’t sound all that bad. I imagined masks and physical comedy, perhaps a little sexuality, but nothing my sophisticated New Yorker persona couldn’t handle.
My first night, I went to meet my neighbor at the entrance so he could show me around. I arrived 10 minutes early, trying to make a good impression in my crisp collared shirt, dark pants, and leather shoes.
From there, all my prior plans went to shit.
My neighbor was in London, for starters, and my new guide into New York’s underground nightlife was the bald man in purple-tinted glasses in his late forties who found me at the door. We went in through the main entrance, a single black door on an otherwise inconspicuous brick building, and he pointed out the essentials: “To your right are the stairs that lead up to the dressing rooms. Here’s the downstairs bar, right where people come in. Left stairs lead to the VIP section and upstairs bar. Don’t go there unless we tell you to. And here’s the stage, where you’ll spend most of your time.”
He left me with the stage manager, who explained that my job for the night was to sit on the bench next to him and just enjoy the show: “You know, get a feel for the place so you’ll know what to do in the future. But first, one question,” he paused, a little mischievous twinkle in his blue eyes, “do you like weed?” He pulled out a vaporizer hose from beneath his desk. “I had this built in last month, best addition to the station ever.”
If you’re thinking of heading to Wall Street after graduation, I won’t ruin the show for you. Suffice it to say, four years of quietly doing schoolwork were finally repaid karmically and, between the pasty-clad waitresses and nothing-clad performers, and the expensive drinks the guests paid for and the free ones I got as staff, I was hooked.
It didn’t take long for me to pick up the habits of my coworkers. I slept through the day and got used to my nocturnal schedule. I kept my headset on through the entire night, to set myself apart as an important person on the floor, separate from the visitors who had to wait in line and pay to get in. I grew used to hanging out backstage with the performers, chatting with them about their next trip to Paris or Los Angeles, and traded small talk with Jude Law and Matthew Perry (“I hear you’re a pretty good cook”—Mr. Jude Law, 2010).
I took a perverse joy in making my friends’ parents uncomfortable, explaining in more detail than they wanted how my job had me cleaning up fake body fluids and fetching dildos from the storeroom whenever they asked about my “interesting” work. A happy sense of elitism set in, and I allowed myself to think I might fit in with my new crowd every once and awhile.
Of course, I never truly did. My roots were as anchored in manners and honest work as my coworkers’ roots were in drugs and parties. More than once I had a complete stranger come up to me while I was guarding the stairs to the dressing rooms to ask me what a nice boy like me was doing in a not-so-nice place like this.
And I wondered myself. Was I learning some valuable life lesson by pretending to be a grown up in an adult world? Was there some artistic meaning behind the pre-op transsexual on stage pulling the beer bottle out of her ass? Did I gain some strength of character by figuring out that you couldn’t reason with the drunk Frenchman trying to visit the girls backstage, but instead you must use your height to your advantage and to simply yell louder than him?
Surely the answer is yes. At least I hope it is. Regardless, when budget cuts meant they no longer had room for me on staff, I thanked them for the time we’d shared and we all gladly parted ways. I found a job waiting tables and sorting papers, like any normal 18 year old would.
And gradually, I left it all behind. Or, at least, I left most of it behind—my Converse still have stains where that transsexual’s fake vomit got on them once. That shit never comes out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s hockey team faced off against Brown, the Crimson came away with the NCAA Division I record for ties with 11 overall in the season.
But on Friday night at Bright Hockey Center facing the Bears (1-3, 0-2 ECAC) in the first conference game for Harvard, the No. 13 Crimson (2-1, 1-1) was able to skate to a 3-2 victory, defeating Brown in the 161st installment of the oldest rivalry in college hockey.
The deciding goal of the night was a career first, and not by one of many freshman forwards, but by senior Brendan Rempel.
The defenseman fired a slap shot from the right point through a screen in the second period for Harvard’s third goal of the game. The goal was assisted by sophomore Tommy O’Regan and freshman Brian Hart—recording the first point of his collegiate career.
“I had a lot of time and space,” Rempel said. “The forwards did a really good job off the cycle having one guy in front of the net at all times so when the goalie can’t see it, it makes it a lot easier for the D to get it through.”
The goal capped off a three-goal outburst by the Crimson in the second period, in which all of the goals of the game were scored.
Harvard was then able to withstand the Bears’ comeback bid, holding on to one-goal lead throughout the third period after Brown scored soon after Rempel’s goal.
“We are excited to get the win,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think it was a frustrating game at times because we were getting some chances but we couldn’t get any separation…They are a tough team to play against, [they] always play us tough, and we are excited to get the win.”
Last year Harvard was known for its nation-leading power play, but recently the Crimson’s penalty kill has been its strong point. Dating back to last year’s ECAC quarterfinals against Yale, Harvard has killed 30 of its last 31 penalties.
“I think it starts with the goaltending; most nights your goaltender needs to be your best penalty killer.” Donato said. “But I think our team speed is such that we can put a lot of pressure on teams, and I think we have a couple pairs of defensemen that really do a good job killing penalties.”
On Friday night, the Crimson’s offensive momentum started on the penalty kill, with sophomore Colin Blackwell scoring an unassisted short-handed goal to knot the score at one at 11:31 in the second. After Brown lost the puck in the offensive zone, Blackwell took the puck up the left side of the ice, cut back towards the center past a Bear defenseman, and fired a wrist shot past junior Brown goalie Marco DiFilippo.
“The Blackwell goal gave us a shot of life,” Donato said. “After that, I thought we really started to play a much better game.”
Soon after the Bears’ power play expired, Harvard took the lead with help from a pair of rookies. Freshman and ECAC Rookie of the Week Jimmy Vesey sent a crisp pass from the right side to classmate Kyle Criscuolo, who promptly completed the play with a low wrist shot past DiFilippo on the right for the first goal of his collegiate career.
Rempel made it 3-1 with his goal, scoring after receiving the puck after a battle along the boards behind the net on the right.
The Bears responded less than two minutes later, with sophomore forward Matt Lorito receiving a pass from sophomore Matt Harlow from the left and firing a shot over the shoulder of Girard.
No goals were scored in the final frame, as the Crimson was able to survive Brown’s 12 shots and six-on-four advantage in the final 30 seconds of the game.
The Bears originally initiated the scoring for the game 3:24 into the second period after a relatively uneventful first frame, in which Harvard outshot Brown 13-8 despite losing the faceoff battle 12-8.
Less than four minutes into the second, freshman Brandon Pfeil took a slap shot that assistant captain Chris Zaires was able to redirect in heavy traffic in front of the net past Crimson goalie and junior Raphael Girard.
Overall, Girard finished the game with 27 saves, as the Crimson outshot the Bears, 42-29. The usually potent power play for Harvard finished 0 for 4 on the night, despite the one shorthanded goal.
“These are the kind of experiences when you win you that you enjoy because I think it makes your team a little mentally [tougher],” Donato said. “And it’s a situation we hope to be in at the end of the game with a lead more often than not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over halfway through the third period of Saturday night’s game, the No. 13 men’s hockey team put together a string of passes to get sophomores Colin Blackwell and Tommy O’Regan in front of goal. Yale goalie Jeff Malcolm made a pad save—one of 28 saves on the night—on a shot by Blackwell, and before the crowd at Bright Hockey Center could exhale in disappointment, the Bulldogs were already breaking down the ice. Crimson captain defenseman Danny Biega couldn’t get back in time and junior goalkeeper Raphael Girard was left hopeless as Yale senior Andrew Miller found junior Kenny Agostino across net for an easy goal.
“We had our chances tonight, and Malcolm came up big,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We had a great tip play in front. Malcolm made another great save, and then they just outworked us and got a goal. They deserved to win. We’ve got to give them credit.”
Agostino’s goal put the Bulldogs (2-1-1, 1-1 ECAC) up, 4-1, and another Agostino score on the break with six seconds left to play gave Yale the 5-1 win over Harvard (2-1, 1-1) to conclude the opening weekend of conference play.
Agostino’s breaks were representative of the game on the whole, as the Crimson’s loss was marked by missed opportunities and sloppy mistakes. Agostino also registered two assists on the night.
“Quite frankly, they were a hungrier team tonight,” Donato said. “They wanted it more and it showed.... They beat us to the puck too often, and we held onto the puck too long. We’ll learn from it and admit that we need to be a lot better.”
Yale started the scoring 3:20 into the second period on a slap shot by junior Jesse Root past Girard and into the top-right corner of the net. Root and line-mate Miller kept the pressure on all night, as the Bulldogs outshot Harvard, 49-29.
“Miller was outstanding tonight,” Donato said. “He was a factor all night with his speed, he had some great passes—he was dangerous.”
Root scored again in the second period, this time at the 3:27 mark, taking an assist from Colin Dueck in front of net. There was a crowded scrum in front of Girard’s net that ended up with the puck sliding over the line for the Bulldogs’ second goal of the night.
Sophomore Trent Ruffolo scored a similar goal early in the third period to put Yale up, 3-1, and effectively out of reach.
Despite the five goals, Girard—who took over the starting job at the end of last season—continued a solid start to the new year with 44 saves.
“Girard has been exceptional so far,” Biega said. “He’s been absolutely fantastic. We can’t ask any more of him. We just have to help him on the second and third shots and cover defensively.”
Harvard thought it got on the board early after a shot by sophomore Petr Placek beat the goalie but couldn’t beat the post. It appeared to drop straight down and over the line, but an official review ruled it was not a goal.
Offensively, the power play was the team’s most powerful weapon last season. But after leading the country in power-play efficiency in 2011-12, the Crimson currently has just one power-play goal in 10 chances.
“It’s early in the season, and we’ve got to put some time and work in to figure it out,” Biega said of the power play. “We have a lot of good guys on the power play, and I think it can be as good as last year.”
Halfway through the first period, freshman Kyle Criscuolo brought the home team even after getting the puck in front of net off passes from classmate Brian Hart and sophomore Tommy O’Regan. Criscuolo collected the puck and put it into the top-left corner for his second goal of the weekend and of his young career.
“I though Criscuolo, Hart, and O’Regan, two nights in a row now, have been our best line,” Donato said after Saturday’s loss. “They had some great chances, some good fore-checking, and really went out there and played.”
This year’s freshman class was touted as the best in the ECAC, and so far it has not disappointed. Last week, freshman Jimmy Vesey was named ECAC Player of the Week, and he and Criscuolo are first and second, respectively, on the team in points. Despite their play, Donato emphasized the need for veterans to play at a higher level.
“Sure, the freshman looked good, but in games like this, you’ve got to really live on how your seniors and older guys perform,” Donato said. “Tonight, their best guys played better than our best guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a bittersweet weekend for the Harvard women’s volleyball team, which fell to Columbia on Friday night but came back to defeat Cornell on Saturday to give Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss her 250th win on Senior Night at the Malkin Athletic Center.
On Friday, after a pregame ceremony with Harvard volleyball alumnae, the Crimson (9-14, 6-6 Ivy) played close sets against the Lions (12-9, 7-5) but could not hold on, dropping the game in four, 27-25, 19-25, 25-18, 28-26.
On Saturday night, Harvard swept the Big Red (7-16, 3-9) in three sets, 25-22, 25-18, and 25-19. The match marked the final home games for outside hitter Taylor Docter and setter Beth Kinsella, two seniors who have combined to make 170 appearances for the team and have cemented their place in Crimson history.
With two games left to play, Docter sits in eighth place in career kills with 963—12 out of seventh place. Docter also ranks in the top 10 all-time in service aces, attack attempts, and kills per set. Kinsella ranks sixth in all-time assists.
The duo added to their totals this weekend, with Docter recording 19 kills and Kinsella notching 43 assists.
“They have been leaders on and off the court,” Weiss said. “Beth has always been a very diligent worker, day in and day out. On the court, Taylor has got composure and confidence that is contagious. They have put a lot of time and effort in and it has paid off their senior season.”
Weiss—the longest tenured coach in program history with 20 seasons under her belt—kept quiet about her milestone before the game on Saturday.
“She didn’t even mention it, so I didn’t know that was coming,” Kinsella said. “It’s a great testament to all that she’s devoted to the program, and I’m really happy that it could fall on such a fun night.”
The last home game of the season was emotional for both seniors, who were honored in a pregame ceremony with their parents and families.
“Over the past four year, the MAC had become a home for us,” said Kinsella, who was joined by her parents and four older siblings. “Playing here [Saturday night] with my family and the crowd was really special, and taking care of Cornell in three games just made it that much more sweet.”
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 0
After Harvard fell to Columbia the previous night, Cornell was no match for a powerful Crimson offense led by freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace’s game-high 13 kills.
Harvard dropped four straight points to open the first set, but the team quickly found its offensive rhythm.
“We did a good job just taking it one point at a time,” said Kinsella, who combined with freshman setter Hannah Schmidt for 37 assists. “There were a few moments where we were down or it was really close, but we had this inherent confidence that we were steady and we were going to take care of it.”
In its second victory over the Big Red this season, Harvard relied on a strong defensive effort led by freshman middle blocker Caroline Holte, who had seven of the team’s 22 block assists.
“Our blocking and our defense were really strong, and any time those things are strong it allows us to diversify our offense and get a lot of kills,” Kinsella said.
With the win, the Harvard remains in fifth place in the Ivy League.
“It feels good to end on a good night,” Docter said. “It’s nice to have two games in a weekend because we had a chance to come back.”
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 1
After dropping the first set to Columbia on Friday night, the Crimson came back to take the second. But Harvard couldn’t build on its momentum. The Lions was able to find holes in the Crimson’s defense and win the next two, defeating Harvard for the first time this season.
“They scouted us well, and they were targeting our weaker areas,” said junior right side Erin Cooney. “On offense they definitely knew where to block us and what our hitting tendencies were, which was really frustrating.”
The Crimson’s best stretch of the night came at the end of the second set. With the score tied at 19, Harvard went on a five-point run to close out the game, scoring the winning point on an attack error by Lions middle hitter Katarina Jovicic.
“In the second game we realized that if we could get on a run with them, they would shut down,” Cooney said. “When they got a run [in the third] we broke down a little bit and weren’t expecting it. From that point on the momentum went away a little bit.”
Cooney, Docter and Wallace all notched double-digit kills for the Crimson, but it was not enough to overcome an offensive onslaught by the Lions. Outside hitter Megan Gaughn’s 20 kills kept Columbia ahead throughout the night, and she scored the game winning point for the Lions in the fourth set.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After junior Damani Wilson carved up the Columbia defense for 121 yards on 8 carries, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy reached deeper down his depth chart on the following drive, sending out freshman Andrew Larson in the hopes of running out the clock rather than running past the Lions.
But Larson ran for 34 yards on three carries, so Murphy opted to have freshman quarterback Scott Hosch kneel three times and hand the ball over to Columbia (2-6, 1-4 Ivy).
It was that kind of day for the Crimson (7-1, 4-1). Seemingly the only person who could stop Harvard was its own head coach as nine players scored touchdowns in a 69-0 rout.
Four of those touchdowns came in a span of less than four minutes early in the second quarter to turn a 7-0 battle into a 28-0 blowout. Senior Colton Chapple capped a 74-yard drive with a touchdown pass to junior Andrew Berg before the Crimson offense took advantage of two Lions turnovers deep in their half of the field with touchdowns by seniors Treavor Scales and Kyle Juszczyk. On Columbia’s next drive, the Harvard defense didn’t give its offense a chance to score as junior Connor Loftus returned an interception all the way to the end zone.
When the Crimson offense did get back on the field, freshman backup running back Paul Stanton put Harvard in scoring range, and Chapple did the rest with an 11-yard touchdown scamper. After breaking the program single-season passing touchdowns record and scoring his seventh rushing touchdown of the year, the signal-caller wouldn’t see the end zone again after Murphy pulled him at halftime.
The Crimson’s second-team offense, led by Stanton and sophomore quarterback Connor Hempel, started the second half just as strong, marching the team 69 yards for a touchdown. It was senior senior Rich Zajeski’s turn on Harvard’s next possession as he ran for 38 yards on the drive and would later get his first touchdown since Week 3.
“Our line really [was] wearing down the other line and [was] able to create big holes,” Wilson said.
By the end of the day, four Crimson running backs scored touchdowns, including two for the fourth-stringer, Wilson.
“We are very blessed at that position,” Murphy said. “We certainly have more than our fair share of outstanding running backs.”
DOMINANT ‘D’
While the Crimson offense was rolling, the defense kept the Lions from ever getting going. Columbia managed just 149 yards of total offensive, went just 2-for-12 on third-down attempts, and turned the ball over six times as Harvard shut out an opponent for the first time since 2006.
“They did a great job; it’s obviously a group effort when you get a shutout,” Murphy said. “It’s a coordinated effort.... Everything just seemed to gel today, obviously.”
Saturday’s shutout was made possible by a consistent game from all three levels of the defense. Up front, the Crimson put pressure on the quarterback with only three or four rushers, tallying eight sacks to ensure it would lead the FCS for at least another week. Nine players contributed to those eight sacks as the team tallied nine tackles for loss and nine quarterback hurries as well.
The front was just as strong against the run as well, keeping the Lions from getting a single first down on the ground and holding the visitors to a total of -19 net rushing yards, including the sacks, on 21 rushing attempts.
At linebacker, sophomore Jacob Lindsey led the team with six tackles and forced a fumble, and Loftus had a pass breakup and half a sack to go with his interception return for a touchdown.
The secondary was just as dominant. The Lions did not complete a 20-yard pass until there were fewer than 30 seconds left in the game, and Harvard defenders knocked down seven passes and held Columbia’s two quarterbacks to a combined 15-for-37 passing.
“We got great pressure from eight different guys on the front four,” Murphy said. “But all of those guys, whether it was [junior] Chris Splinter, whether it was [junior] Jaron Wilson—all those guys just did a great job on the back end.”
SHORT AND SWEET
Though he didn’t have much time to show it Saturday, Chapple operated with the same efficiency he has demonstrated for most of the season. After an early fumble that was recovered by Harvard, the senior rarely made a mistake, with several of his incompletions coming on yard-saving throwaways when chased out of the pocket.
On the day, Chapple went 13-for-18 passing with 195 yards and three touchdowns through the air and one on the ground.
“We’ve had guys that look better in uniform, guys that can bench press more, whatever,” Murphy said. “But boy you put him in a game and, wow, it’s just amazing how he can just get everything to play in slow motion and just seemingly do all of the right things almost all of the time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team outshot Columbia on Saturday evening but failed to score in a 1-0 loss on Senior Night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium. With the defeat, Harvard (2-10-3, 0-5-1 Ivy) extended its winless Ivy drought, having not come out on top in an Ancient Eight contest since 2010 after winning the league in 2009.
Playing in frigid conditions, both the Crimson and the Lions (4-7-4, 2-2-2) struggled to warm up offensively early in the first half, mustering a combined three shots on goal in the period while maintaining primary possession play around midfield.
Harvard’s best opportunity in the first half came 13 minutes into the contest, when senior forward Brian Rogers broke through the Columbia defense to rip a shot on freshman goalkeeper Kyle Jackson from the top of the box. The shot ricocheted off Jackson back to Rogers, leaving him with the ball in front of the net. But his follow-up shot was blocked by a Lions defender and sailed wide of the net.
While this sequence was representative of Harvard’s offensive attempts for the rest of the match, Columbia made its lone shot on goal in the first period count. With eight minutes to play in the half, freshman forward Fredrick Elliot sent in a long throw-in from the right side. Senior defender Quentin Grigsby headed the ball past freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez, who had misjudged its trajectory and allowed it to slide into the right side of the net. Mendez finished the match with one save for the Crimson.
The Harvard offense picked up its intensity in the second half with five shots on goal but was ultimately unable to convert its attempts and tie the contest at one.
The Crimson led the Lions, 13-10, in shots and 7-2 in shots on goal for the match.
Rogers, who was injured last year and has slowly integrated himself into the offense this season, led the team with four shots, three of which were on goal. Freshman forward Oliver White also added two shots on goal.
“We were getting forward pretty well,” co-captain Scott Prozeller said. “We lacked the final pass, but we were creating set pieces and giving ourselves opportunities.”
“We should have come out in the first half the way we played in the second,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi added.
While the opportunities were there, Harvard lacked the extra effort to finish and knot the score. The Crimson was held without a goal for the fifth time this season.
“One player just needed to step up and score a goal, and I think the game would have turned out a lot different,” Kobayashi said.
“It was a disappointing result,” Prozeller added. “I don’t think we were outplayed or outclassed, I just don’t think we came out in the first half. The second half we had a couple opportunities to finish, and that was the difference in the game. They had two opportunities and scored once, [and] we had four or five and couldn’t put them away.”
After the contest, Crimson coach Carl Junot spoke with his team about the result in light of another disappointing Ancient Eight performance.
“We talked about how we take the losses, how we only have two wins, and [how] it’s been like that for two years,” Kobayashi said.
The loss came on Senior Night, when parents came from all over to see the athletes play at home in the conference for the final time.
“It was definitely disappointing to lose [on Senior Night],” Prozeller said. “However, it was nice to have our parents there as support.”
Harvard does have one more opportunity to break its winless Ivy streak when it challenges Penn (2-13, 0-6) on Saturday. The Quakers dwell below the Crimson at the bottom of the Ancient Eight, also winless but with no ties. Harvard will also face Holy Cross (5-9-2, 2-3-2 Patriot) in its final home game on Tuesday night.
As it enters its remaining two contests of the season, the Crimson will aim to put together a total effort, looking to its individuals to step up and lead the way.
“I think we just need to focus on putting a full 90 minutes together,” Prozeller said. “I don’t think that is something we’ve been able to do all year, really executing top-to-bottom for an entire game.”

Are you an asshole? If you're a student of the Ivy League, then according to conservative newsmagazine The National Review's Fred Schwarz, then yes, yes you are.
You can be an asshole from the West, an asshole from the East, a tall asshole or a short asshole. Regardless, you are an "Ivy League ***hole," Schwarz wrote.
A Columbia graduate himself, Schwarz explained an Ivy League admit is, among other things, spontaneously glib on a large number of issues, confident in his or her solutions but resentful that others won't listen, and guilty of accepting the credit for work for which he or she is not responsible (The Ad Board is currently investigating this issue).
These assholeish traits are also common among successful presidential candidates, he wrote.
Schwarz takes issue with the concentration of Ivy League degrees among American presidents in the nation's history.
Schwarz alleges that these assholeish qualities do not carry over to make good presidents. In fact, all of the Ivy League asshole presidents have done poor jobs during their terms in office, Schwarz argued.
"...if you look at the last 50-odd years of presidents, starting with JFK, the Ivy grads have been talkers and dreamers, while the non-Ivy grads have been doers," Schwarz wrote.
Since, according to Schwarz, we at Harvard are all "Ivy League ***holes" by default, we suppose we should just roll with it. Particularly in a year when Gov 1359: "Road to the White House" is being offered.

Tuesday is Election Day, and in case you haven't been paying attention, The Crimson's got you covered. We've pulled together some highlights of our recent political coverage of Massachusetts' U.S. Senate race and the Presidential race to get you up to speed before filling out your ballot.
U.S. Senate Race
The contest between Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat,  has been one of the most-watched and highly contested Senate races in the country this year. Despite agreeing to ban third-party spending on the race, the rivals have combined to raise more than $60 million.
Brown and Warren debated three times this fall, once in Boston, once in Lowell, Mass., and once in Springfield, Mass. They have traded shots back and forth along the way and fought for the increasingly important independent vote.
For more on where they candidates stand on student issues, check out their responses to The Crimson on a number of questions.
Presidential Race
President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney hold little in common politically, but both spent formative years at Harvard en route to the national political stage. Read about Obama's time at Harvard Law School and Romney's time there and across the river at Harvard Business School.
The outcome of Tuesday's election will likely change the course of a number of key issues important to Harvard. The Crimson explored the candidates positions on federal student aid, federal research funding, and immigration policy in a three-part feature series.
Of course, Obama and Romney, a Democrat and Republican respectively, are not the only presidential candidates on the ballot Tuesday, and they are not the only Harvard grads either. Jill E. Stein '73 is running on the Green Party. Read about her candidacy here.
Stay tuned to The Crimson for more elction previews and results. For all of our political coverage, including Congressional and state races, check out the 2012 Election topics page.

For all you undecided voters out there (do you even exist?): the time is now to make up your minds. In the words of a woman who has seen her own political stock plummet in recent weeks, Speak Now or forever hold your peace. (Disregard the fact that T. Swift won't take her own advice, publicly at least.)
While we at Flyby would like to kindly suggest that you decide on who  you'll support here and now, once and for all, there is not much more  information about any of the candidates we give you that they (or The Crimson) haven't already given (see the post below this one).
One more thing you might want to take into consideration, however—and we really think this could swing the vote—is Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz's recent endorsement.
We get it. You were waiting for this opinionated professor to weigh in all along. Thankfully, now he has!  And guys, this is big news coming from a Harvard professor: It's Obama.
Last Tuesday, Dershowitz wrote in the Jerusalem Post: "The case for the  reelection of President Barack Obama is compelling for several  important reasons." Just under the wire, there, Dersh.
Now that we all know what Dershowitz is thinking, let's all get pumped to vote on some real issues.

For many Harvard students, last Monday's hurricane translated to nothing more than a rainy day in pajamas and an extra day to work on that Stat pset. But for those who have family and friends in New York or New Jersey, Hurricane Sandy left destruction in its path—and two Harvard students are doing something about it.
When Meredith C. Baker '13 and Samantha J. Whitmore '13 found out the 2012 New York City Marathon had not been canceled yet on Wednesday, they decided they would not run out of respect to the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Instead, they decided to hold a marathon in Boston the following Sunday in order to raise both awareness and funds to support those affected by the storm.
"I didn't really feel right running it and Meredith didn't either," said Whitmore. "I think people sort of think of New York as a strong city and haven't really noticed that...devastation occurred."
The pair hopes to raise $2,620—100 dollars per mile—which will be donated directly to the American Red Cross to fund disaster relief efforts. The fundraising page of the event, which is open until midnight on Sunday—reported that they had already raised $2,712 as of midday Sunday.
According to the event's Facebook page, 168 people had RSVP'd to attend when the race was underway.
Both Baker and Whitmore have close ties to New York. Whitmore was born and raised in Manhattan and Baker has lived in New York on three separate occasions, where her maternal family also lives. Many of their friends and family in the affected area are experiencing tough times in the wake of the storm due to damage to their homes and schools.
This would have been Whitmore's first time running the race and would have marked Baker's third time participating.
"Our friendship was kind of founded on running," said Baker, who is also a Crimson editorial writer. "We wanted to kind of use [the] New York marathon as a symbolic finish line for senior year."
Baker and Whitmore hope this marathon will be "just the beginning of the Harvard effort." The duo is working with the UC to hold a benefit concert to raise funds for aid, as well.
"I think for some Harvard students, it was like, 'Hurricane Sandy, we get a day off of school,'" Baker said. "Some people haven't really taken time to understand the magnitude of the disaster."
This year's New York City Marathon was the subject of controversy in the city last week, when many said they thought it was inappropriate to hold a race in an area that was still suffering the effects of a natural disaster. Although the marathon was eventually canceled, some runners held an unofficial marathon in the city on Saturday.
Whitmore hopes the Boston race will be a "way to make a silver lining out of a really tragic event."
The duo is currently still running and due to finish any moment now!

Thanks to our readers, the mystery of the green John Harvard has been solved (kind of). While one tipster wondered, "Is John Harvard painted green in honor of [the] stoplight dance last night, meaning he's single?" it turns out (unfortunately for some) that the green paint wasn't a testament to John's relationship status.
Instead, history and multiple tipsters inform us that it was likely pranksters from Dartmouth, intent on spreading their school's color before a big sports event. Still, we're slightly baffled. The next Harvard-Dartmouth game is Men's Swimming and Diving on Nov. 10...and it's taking place at Cornell. That, or Dartmouth was celebrating a win against Women's Soccer on Oct. 28, which seems a bit late for such a big gesture. Either way, if that's what Dartmouth feels they need to do to ensure a win, then we're not all that worried. After all, there's a reason parents say practice, not pranking, makes perfect.
