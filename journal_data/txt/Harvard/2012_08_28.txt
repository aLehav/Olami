After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A flurry of activity erupted Monday morning in Harvard Yard as the Class of 2016 passed through Johnston Gate to move into the freshman dorms. The move-in marks the kick off of Opening Days, the formal orientation for all incoming first-years that occurs every fall.
New students said they felt a combination of excitement and nervousness as they hauled their belongings into dorms, greeted roommates, and settled into their new homes.
“It feels great to be here,” said A.J. Unitas, Jr. ’16, while moving into his room in Grays Hall. “You feel like you’re part of the community as soon as you enter the dorm.”
Unitas, who hails from Baltimore and is interested in Classics, said he was immediately intrigued by his new classmates. “Once you get past the awkward ‘so, where are you from’ initial conversations, it’s great to hear about people’s backgrounds—how they got here, what their passions are.”
Frank Tamberino ‘16, also from Baltimore, said he appreciated the relative peace and quiet in the Union dorms while he was moving into Hurlbut Hall.
“It was nowhere [near] as crowded as the Yard,” said Tamberino. “It was much more peaceful, so I wasn’t as nervous as I thought I’d be.” With a sister at MIT, Tamberino is familiar with the moving in process. Nevertheless, he said that parting ways with the family has not quite sunk in yet. “They’re here for a few more days, so it wasn’t really sad at all.”
Additionally, Tamberino said he has enjoyed meeting fellow Hurlbut residents and looks forward to the days ahead. “The guys on my floor all seem very nice,” said Tamberino. “Everyone is open to meeting new people.”
Some freshman have also arrived with a set of expectations of Harvard social life. Unitas, who caught a glimpse of the social scene during the Visitas weekend this past April, said he is not sure his impressions of Harvard's social scene is correct.
“I’ve heard about the social life from a few Prefrosh and mostly from ‘The Social Network’,” he said. “Essentially, I’m trying to find the gray area between what students tell me and Justin Timberlake attempting to conceal the cocaine on his fingertips.”
In the coming week, the Class of 2016 will attend a variety of orientation events geared to prepare them for classes and campus life.
But the primary event on students' minds was dinner—their first meal in Annenberg Hall as students. “It’s gonna be a zoo in there,” Unitas said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team will return from its week-long trip to Italy with a perfect 4-0 record after defeating Paffoni Omegna, 81-62, Monday afternoon in Verbania.
But more exciting for Crimson fans than Harvard’s four routs over Italian club teams—the Crimson won by an average of 20.5 points per game—is that Harvard appeared to answer a number of key questions surrounding its 2012-13 squad.
With the graduation of Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12 in May, the Crimson entered the offseason with a number of holes to fill—namely Wright’s 10.6 points and 8.1 rebounds per game.
Harvard’s sophomore class may have the answer.
Sophomore wing Wes Saunders went off in Italy, leading the Crimson in scoring in three of four contests. After averaging 3.3 points in 13.9 minutes per game off the bench as a rookie, Saunders poured in a team-high 16.5 points per game over the week, including a 21-point, six-rebound, four-assist performance against Paffoni Omegna.
A highly-touted recruit out of Los Angeles, Saunders is making a strong case for his insertion into the Crimson’s starting lineup this coming November. While Saunders will have to beat out sharp-shooting wings Christian Webster and Laurent Rivard—who did not travel with the Crimson to Italy in order to attend training camp for the Canadian men’s national team—for the job, his strength as a perimeter defender should aid his cause.
While Saunders supplied the scoring, his classmate Kenyatta Smith may have the answer in the post. Also a highly-touted prospect out of high school, Smith failed to contribute in his rookie season, appearing in just eight contests and averaging 2.1 minutes per game.
But in Italy, Smith began to demonstrate why ESPN ranked him the No. 17 center in the high school class of 2011. Smith opened the trip with a team-high 10 rebounds in a 75-64 win over Rieti and then followed up two games later with 15 points in an 83-52 victory against Bassano Basket.
“Proud of the team for going 4-0,” co-captain Brandyn Curry tweeted. “Glad to see the sophomores really step up on this trip.”
While the Crimson may return to Cambridge with options for replacing Wright’s scoring and rebounding, it still remains to be seen how Harvard will handle the loss of McNally—a talented ball handler and decision maker.
Sophomore Alex Nesbitt handled backup point guard duties in Italy, but the Crimson hopes it will get something out of freshman guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers and the rest of the Harvard rookies were not allowed to travel abroad with their teammates but will begin working out with the upperclassmen in the coming weeks.
