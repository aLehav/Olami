After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of the school year, Harvard College’s mission was tossed around over and over again: It seeks “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society...through our commitment to the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education.” After a semester, I expected this “transformative power” to be cemented in my mind, and to  learn about how I would be changed for the better in my time here. That has not been the case.
Speaking as a freshman, my exposure to the “liberal arts” at Harvard has left me with the impression that the term is nothing more than a buzzword. It has become clear to me that the General Education requirements—the College’s main institution for educating students in the liberal arts—are troublesome courses that students feel they need to get over with as soon as possible.
While their reevaluation has been a step in the right direction, the foremost problem with the liberal arts at Harvard is students’ lack of identification with their core principles, a cultural deficit that incoming freshman immediately encounter and accept upon their arrival here. In order to meaningfully enact an ethos rooted in the transformative power of the liberal arts, no amount of curriculum shifting can be adequate: Gen Eds need to play a more fundamental, intimate role in the Harvard experience.
“Liberal” conveys the concept of freedom. “Arts” communicates the creative mediums by which individuals seek expression. Altogether, the liberal arts set people free—free to think for themselves, free to consider other viewpoints, and free to communicate their ideas and opinions. In order to educate citizens and citizen-leaders, Harvard must instill free thinking because it is necessary to be informed and engaged. In short, beyond our individual academic interests, we must all cultivate an ability to independently read, listen, think, communicate, and act.
A properly functioning Gen Ed system would do this by exposing students to different methods of thinking. The Gen Ed requirement categories aim to train students to think through humanistic, quantitative, scientific, historical, social, and civic lenses.
But in February 2015, the General Education Review Committee’s Interim Report declared the obvious: Students and faculty often do not understand Gen Ed’s grounding principles, Gen Ed courses do not always fulfill their ideological goals, non-departmental Gen Ed courses have a median class size of 50 to 99 students, and, most importantly, Gen Eds do not occupy a substantial place in Harvard’s identity. These issues impoverish the liberal arts: If we do not understand the Gen Ed program, how can we uphold its principles? Moreover, with such large median class sizes, discussions are too broad to involve communication, contention, and resolution.
Of course, the Gen Ed program as it stands is not meritless. The problem is that the categories have become isolated components of our curriculum, an exercise in getting things done quickly. As a freshman, I’ve invested far more time into the minutiae of scheduling than considering Gen Ed’s ideals. Recent reform has reframed Gen Ed: new categories, new labels, new course arrangements, and new principles. This reevaluation is an important step, but we must get to the root: our culture. If the Gen Ed categories represent the ways Harvard students should perceive the world, they should pervade the Harvard experience.
Discussions, speakers, and town halls could be an expansion of Gen Ed requirements, giving students the opportunity to encounter liberal arts thinking outside the course catalog. In the spirit of student communication and interaction, we need an emphasis on small group discussion outside the classroom. We need to connect with those who think differently, who have different mindsets and worldviews. Above all else, we need to embrace the discomfort of trying on new ways of thinking about the world, however unfamiliar they may feel to us.
Gen Ed reform cannot solely be rooted in the curriculum, or else the program will remain isolated and distinct from any form of communal identity we can form around the liberal arts. If we present current and incoming students with a better appreciation for the Gen Ed program at Harvard, we can better work towards understanding our “transformation” into the citizens and citizen-leaders of our world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Trump’s recent executive order barring legal immigrants and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries and indefinitely suspending all refugee programs has been met with adamant public protests and increasing bipartisan resistance. This opposition is not surprising. At the heart of the order is an attack on fundamental human rights, and as such we believe the new policy to be deeply immoral.
America has always represented a comparatively greater adherence to fairness, especially for foreign nationals who look to the United States. This image of success has depended less on family background or on the favor of corrupt officials than it has in many other countries. For refugees with few alternatives for basic survival, America represents one of the only options for a respite. For some, that means a life beyond death and destruction at home.
Although we have a long way to go in terms of economic mobility and equal opportunities within our borders, the popular American national narrative has largely looked the same for those living in this country: through hard work, one can succeed regardless of background or identity, because we are all created equal. Whether or not this is the reality for all Americans, this is the image the United States presents to the rest of the world.
Trump’s executive order exists in blatant mockery of this professed American ideal of universal promise. And thus, the order seems to contradict the hope of a shared collective humanity.
Its severity also breaks from precedent. Previous administrations, including former President Barack Obama’s, had restricted visas for citizens of countries who are now affected by Trump’s decision, but this action goes much farther.
Moreover, a blanket ban on immigrants and refugees from the countries affected by the order, who have already been heavily vetted, does nothing to promote national security. From 1975 to 2015, none of the seven countries listed in the executive order produced foreigners that have killed Americans on U.S. soil in a terrorist attack. Rather, this executive order is an act of anti-Muslim discrimination that both plays on fears at home and erodes global attitudes toward the United States—a dramatic escalation of the post-9/11 worries about terrorism.
Those who go to great lengths to immigrate to the United States often retain a special appreciation for the stability that America represents. In turn, their children contribute diverse stories of personal growth centered around the American experience. Ultimately, these young adults, of whom there are many at Harvard and other colleges, inspire their communities to the same extent they benefit from them. The order is thus not only bad immigration and national security policy, but an obstacle preventing America's educational institutions from fully serving as places teeming with diversity, both of background and of experiences.
As stories of the Harvard students and affiliates barred from completing their studies here continue to emerge, we are glad for the unconditional support of President Faust and Dean Khurana for our colleagues and friends from abroad.
For Harvard to uphold its commitment to equal educational opportunity regardless of national origin, members of this institution must do their utmost to prevent the Trump administration from continuing on this trajectory. Much like the millions of Americans who spontaneously protested the executive order in airports and streets throughout the nation, Harvard must leverage its political power to protect the people it serves.  Standing up for our basic human rights in a time of increasing political uncertainty can only be done through collective and empathetic protest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Out of nowhere, a man interrupted the Emergency Boston Rally, a solidarity rally in Harvard Square after President Trump signed the immigration ban Executive Order, yelling that Muslims hate and kill gay people. While this caught many protestors—including myself—by surprise, we responded quickly, and without malevolence, chanting: “No hate, no fear! No hate, no fear!”
Blatantly bigoted stereotyping opened the doors of the White House for President Trump. On his campaign trail, he fed on the fears of conservative Americans by taking individual, specific acts, and using them to characterize entire minority groups.
I remember Barack Obama’s 2004 DNC speech in which he proclaimed that “We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.” For many, this display of unity and nationalism inspired the hope that we could be more than a people fragmented, acting solely for their own benefit, and that instead we could work for the benefit of all if we inculcate ourselves with love rather than hate.
Now, more than ever, we need to remember this, and extend this quotation from Obama’s DNC speech abroad. Everybody on this earth is one people, and while we may all pledge allegiance to a different flag, or worship a different god, or have a different skin tone, we are all still people working toward the benefit of the world we live on. Because we all inhabit the same planet, rash and malicious decisions in one country—especially the United States, which is often viewed as an international leader—have severe global impacts and repercussions. Actions taken in one country are not internationally isolated.
Trump’s presidency does not serve to unite American people—let alone the people of the world—but instead separates us along the lines of race, religion, sexual orientation, citizenship status, and many other identifiers. President Trump and his policies present themselves as a hydra of hate—when one head is cut off, more grow in its place. Defeating this serpentine, acid-spitting beast is no easy feat, just as defeating the hatred spewed and normalized by President Trump will be an arduous task requiring communal effort.
At the rally, one of the speakers noted that “We need to conjure that unity” necessary to protect our fellow citizens of the world, not through hate, but through love. As Michelle Obama said, “When they go low, we go high.” We need to come together—to put aside our prejudices—and fight through love. If President Trump and his policies do not divide us, we will survive the next four years.
The Women’s March on Washington and its sister marches, which attracted millions of people globally, proved to unite people through intersectionality against hate. However, it is important not to forget fellow citizens, such as transgender women who felt underrepresented at the Women’s March, yet are arguably the most vulnerable and attacked women.
As more and more protests and rallies are being advertised as an effort to continue support for one another and resist President Trump, it is important to remember love. It is important to not only fight for the rights that will benefit us as individuals, but to also fight for policies that will aid others. People who are not Muslim should attend rallies for Muslim rights. Straight people should resist acts like the First Amendment Defense Act and Mike Pence’s views on conversion therapy. People who were born in the United States should battle for the rights of immigrants. Those who attend private schools must oppose Betsy DeVos even if her proposed policies will primarily impact those who attend public schools.
If the rights of one are taken away, we all lose. Self-interest, self-motivation, and selfish disregard for others put President Trump in the White House. We cannot fight him with those same strategies. One of the final speakers at the Emergency Rally quoted Wael Ghonim, stating that “The power of the people is much stronger than the people in power.” Together, we can preserve each other’s rights in the face of hate, but only if we work together and for each other.
The heckler at the Emergency Boston Rally may have believed he was advocating for gay rights when he intruded with Islamophobic speech. However, we cannot condone such actions when fighting for our rights. The fight for the rights of one community should be equal to the fight for the rights of any other. The United States is a melting pot of peoples and cultures. That is what makes the United States special. There is no room for hate, there is no room for fear. Everyone is welcome here.

To the Editor:
We are signing this statement of protest against the president’s executive order entitled "Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States,” of Jan. 27, 2017. It “suspends entry into the United States,” for various periods of time, of refugees, Syrian refugees, and “aliens” without green cards from seven nations.  We offer three reasons for opposing this order:
As political scientists, we have committed our professional lives to the study of good governance, and the attainment of the widely shared values of human dignity, rights, and democratic engagement. Research by members of our discipline shows that people’s ability to move across borders has enabled the United States to thrive, that overreach by political leaders can undermine liberal democratic norms and practices, that hostile relations with nations with whom the U.S. is not at war can increase political violence and extremism, and that the separation of religion and state is a core commitment of the United States’ constitutional system. The executive order violates all of those established findings.
As scholars, we deplore this order’s interruption of research, teaching, and intellectual interchange at American colleges and universities. International exchanges are essential to good scholarship, and an important way for people of different cultures and political systems to engage constructively with one another.
As teachers, we deplore the interruption of study and engagement of students who are blocked by this executive order from classes at American colleges and universities. We are concerned about the order’s impact on the many students whose lives will be directly and indirectly affected by the ban. Furthermore, this executive order teaches all the wrong lessons to our students and those coming behind them: It conveys fear, anger, governmental overreach, discrimination, and false statements.
Therefore, we urge President Trump to rescind this executive order immediately. If he does not do so, we urge the Congress to override it, the courts to issue further stays, and Americans to protest the ban on refugees and Muslim-majority nation residents. Political scientists’ research has shown that robust protest and political courage can offset the worst excesses of public officials; let us put that knowledge to use.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Trump presidency has been criticized relentlessly—and in many cases, I would say, rightly so—since it bulldozed into the White House but two weeks ago. However, there does seem to be a discernible aversion, at least among certain circles, to giving this administration credit where credit is due, to highlighting and celebrating policy changes made by the administration that are particularly sensible and efficacious.
Coming off the bizarre Jan. 21 “press conference,” in which Press Secretary Sean Spicer made the much-disputed claim that Trump’s was the most-watched inauguration ever, it seemed unlikely that anything positive could emerge out of Trump’s media relations team. However, in a hardly-reported yet unprecedented move Wednesday—ironic, given the profession of those in the room when the change was revealed—the secretary invited reporters from across the country to ask questions of him via Skype. These so-called “Skype Seats” created by the Trump administration in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room create a degree of openness, innovation, and diversity that should make any supporter of genuine press freedom rejoice.
This move is historic for a number of reasons. For one, it harnesses the truly equalizing powers of technology to create a more inclusive press-president relationship. The news industry is struggling financially, and this technological innovation allows organizations that might otherwise lack the financial resources to travel to Washington, DC from their bases across the country the ability to inquire as to the president’s activities, regardless of their financial circumstances and their geographic location. This is undoubtedly a win for those who value a truly dispersed, non-monopolized media environment.
More importantly, however, is the fact that this move will democratize the president-press relationship, making it more responsive to the issues that really matter to ordinary and diverse Americans. Presently, the news media that is meant to hold the president to account is astonishingly homogenous. A glance down the list of the White House Press Corps reveals that the group is alarmingly coastal, well-heeled, and urban. In the ultimate move of unfairness and elitism, large media organizations are given the benefit of “priority seating” in the news room. Nearly guaranteed positions in the first two rows of the briefing room ensure they are far more likely to be picked to ask a question. When such a narrowly defined segment of society is afforded the exclusive privilege of directly questioning the White House Press Secretary on a daily basis, the American people lose.
Wednesday’s rollout of the Skype Seats—albeit slightly awkward in its execution—all but revealed the gap in interests between these entrenched national, elite media organizations and the more humble, regional outlets that “Skyped in.” While the traditional media continued to question Spicer about petty Senate political squabbles ("How does Chuck Schumer feel about being called a clown by the president on Twitter?") and Supreme Court hypotheticals ("Did Hardiman ever actually leave Pennsylvania?"), the “Skype Chair” media members asked questions that, though on the surface may have appeared somewhat provincial, hit on big issues that have and will continue to directly affect average Americans in their hometowns across the country.
To start things off, Kim Kalunian of Providence's WPRI-12, asked about how and when Trump would withdraw funding from sanctuary cities. Not so unorthodox, but nevertheless a matter on many people’s minds. Natalie Herbick from Fox 8 Cleveland inquired about how Trump specifically planned to revitalize deindustrialized cities such as hers, a matter near and dear to many rust-belters’ hearts. Lars Larsen, of the Lars Larson Show centered in Portland, Oregon, asked whether Trump planned to return federally-owned land (“the federal government is the biggest landlord in America”!) back to the people, and whether he would “tell the forest service to start logging our forests aggressively again, to provide jobs for Americans, wealth for the treasury, and to not spend three and a half billion dollars fighting forest fires.” It is certainly the sort of quirky question that may never have reached the president’s Press Secretary under the old regime, but one that nevertheless clearly mattered to his many listeners. Finally, Jeff Jobe of Jobe Publishing, centered in south-central Kentucky, asked how long it would take for Trump to restore the coal industry in his home-region of Appalachia, following a series of politicians who Jobe claimed had not only “forgotten” about the region’s inhabitants, but had “turned on” them. The interspersed questions were admittedly a welcome reprieve from the generally-predictable lines of inquiry of the physically-present, who overwhelmingly sought to mine Spicer for the President’s opinions on the DC-centric political “hot-takes” of the day.
If we learned anything from this past election, it must be that America hardly knows itself anymore. The socioeconomic and geographic divides in this country are immense. Much of the anger in this country, I suspect, stems from the fact that so many view national institutions as entirely detached and unresponsive—exclusive by design, echo chambers in their own right. Given the way press briefings have been run, the elite media is not immune from these accusations. It is unclear whether the questions asked by the Skypers will influence the President or the general public in any meaningful way. However, the addition of these Skype Seats to the Brady Room is a particularly productive step forward, because it begins to allow so-called “forgotten Americans”—largely rural and non-coastal voters—to engage in and contribute to what should be a truly national conversation.
Our unprecedented access to technology—cheap flights, Skype, the internet—should allow us to know one another better than ever before. But our distances and divisions have grown. This development, which finally brings one of our political institutions (sort of) into the 21st century, is evidently much overdue. There is yet more work to be done in employing technology to heal our divides, but for this President and those to come, the addition of Skype Seats to presidential press briefings will undoubtedly provide greater accountability and more diverse and representative scrutiny. The president and his team should be commended for this move.

Mid-morning on a steely grey Saturday, a long line begins to form in the middle of Brattle Square. Three young women in knit caps and nametags stand at the head of the line, protected by a folding card table piled high with plates. The line curves along Brattle Street into Massachusetts Ave. all the way down to C’est Bon. It circles around the Church Street T-entrance and then doubles up, heading back towards Brattle. Line-waiters fidget in the cold, adjusting their winter gear, shushing their kids,  and checking the time.
Today is the second day of the “Legendary Ninth Annual Harvard Square Chocolate Festival,” a weekend event held by the Harvard Square Business Association to promote sweet stuff and local business. In minutes, the knit-capped women will open entry to the festival’s pièce de resistance––a free tasting of chocolate sweets from 20 nearby eateries.
The tastings will be highly structured: On the hour, the knit-capped ladies will start passing out plates to the first in line. The plated few will file into the closed-off tasting area and load up on free chocolate cannolis,  chocolate truffles, chocolate ice cream, and at least seventeen other desserts both free and chocolate. They’ll leave the area, and then more plates will be passed out. You must have a plate to play. There’s only one rule, but it’s strict: No plate, no chocolate.
When asked why she braved the cold, Karen Soate, a straw-haired woman with a dog of similar coloring, standing at the very end of the 1000-person line, says simply “It’s free, it’s chocolate.” Chocolate-lovers seem to see their affection as self-evident –– everyone answers my question like this, as if complimentary chocolate were a concept too fundamental to be further explained.
They may have a point –– the very same argument was used to found the festival nine years prior. Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, says the festival was born out of foot traffic–– or rather, a lack of it.
“Nine years ago, business owners noticed that in December-January-February people don’t walk around the Square as much,” Jillson says. “They wanted an occasion to bring people back out into the community.”
The Association might have held any number of community events –– a carnival or a winter market or a book fair –– but instead they chose chocolate.
“Because everyone loves chocolate!” Jillson explains.
As the opening hour approaches and more people join the overcrowded line, it becomes clear the effort has succeeded. But for those who aren’t fans of the crowd, the line, or the crescendoing drumline of Boston’s Grooversity percussionists, there are quieter ways to participate in the festivities.
The most subtle event on the schedule can be found across the Yard at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Their featured exhibit, “Glass Flowers: The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants”, includes among its 4,000 models a single glass replica of the Cacao plant. The small pod can be found near the rear of the display room, between the models of two leafy reeds.
Other crowd-averse chocolate connoisseurs might try the parking garage tucked under the Smith Center. The Propark Garage attendant keeps a small beige bowl of peppermint patties to pass out to drivers. He seems to be enjoying success –– when we speak, only two silver patties remain in the bowl.
Back above ground, the digital clock strikes one, and a thousand flushed chocolate lovers all file forward, piling sweets onto their plates.

My second-grade Sunday school teacher, Dawn, had really good posture. But not in a confident way; hers was that “I am a perpetually uncomfortable person” kind of posture. She had short grey hair and a gentle walk. At the time, I thought she was old. Given my ability to perceive age as an eight-year-old, this means she was probably somewhere between 30 and 100 years old. But she had a grandmotherly air to her. I remember that.
She was the kind of person who would have been a really terrible grandmother to your average rambunctious youth, who would have taken advantage of her generous soul. But she would have been an incredible grandmother to the quiet kid who asked how her skin got so wrinkly and what life was like before CD players.
I was the latter, at least in the context of Sunday school, which I always found inexplicably intimidating. I felt a connection to Dawn—if nothing else, we were the two quietest people in the room. I spent most of my time in class observing her as she shifted her weight nervously with the occasional “If the children would please quiet down, please, thank you.” The other kids shouted over her timid lectures, threw crayons at each other, and interrupted class with fart noises.
This chaos remained consistent throughout the year. The only time I recall it ebbing was the day that Dawn, perhaps hoping a display of emotional vulnerability might attract some sympathy from her tormentors, decided to tell us a story. A personal one.
This was an interesting plot twist in the saga of Sundays. Without friends to entertain me and with no personal information about Dawn, I had invented my own version of Dawn’s life. Inspired by the story in the Bible about the strangers who come down to visit and turn out to be messengers from God, I had decided that Dawn, too, was such a messenger. Obviously, I imagined, she would tell God to be annoyed at all the kids who were rude to her. When they got to heaven they’d all get in trouble.
Not so much. The story Dawn told us was far less remarkable than my grandiose vision.
She told us about a part of her life when she had been really sad for a long time. And how one day, in the midst of this sadness, she opened her apartment door and found a single candle that someone had left for her. The candle smelled really nice, but the realization that someone had noticed her sadness and wanted to help her was nicer. She thought it was a neighbor who did it, but she never knew for certain.
I don’t remember why she told us this story. It was relevant to something, I’m sure. But the important part was that nobody interrupted Dawn’s story. No shouting, no crayon tossing, no fart noises. The room was silent. It felt cinematic, the way everything suddenly froze so this soft-spoken grandma could tell her awkward tale of light in the darkness to a room of uncharacteristically silent eight-year-olds. What resonated with me then—and what still resonates with me, years later—wasn’t the beauty of the moment, though this certainly set the mood. It wasn’t even the moral, but how the story itself began: “During a really dark time in my life, when I was really sad for a while.”
I didn’t know you were allowed to say that. I didn’t know you were allowed to feel that way. I knew you could be mad when your friend sat on your American Girl Doll’s bicycle and broke the seat off. I knew you could be sad when your brother wouldn’t let you play with his friends. What I didn’t know was that you could feel bad without a “because.” I didn’t know you could feel that way for a while, for no reason at all.
This possibility was completely new, and at the time I mostly thought, “Huh. How bout that?” But in later years, as I began to deal with more complex emotions, Dawn’s story became a source of comfort. Other people feel this way too, I whispered to myself on nights when I cried for no reason, long before discussions of mental health were the norm. It’s okay to feel bad just ‘cause.
I’ve always wished I were a morning person. I’m jealous of people who eat breakfast and start their days before noon. But I don’t mind missing daybreak. I don’t know the beauty of the rising sun, so it’s never eclipsed the association with “Dawn” I’ve stored away in my brain. I like it that way.

On Jan. 18, a group of students gathers at the Phillips Brooks House, sharpies and tubs of glitter paint in hand. Donald Trump will be inaugurated in two days, but for many, the work of resisting his administration has already begun.
“I think a lot of activist groups were having conversations after the election like, ‘Yo, what just happened? How are we going to deal with this?’” Sonya A. L. Karabel ’18, an inactive Crimson editor, says, leaning over a poster board. She finishes penciling in the words “ACA SAVES LIVES,” and starts to trace them in pink and purple paint.
From that initial sense of disbelief, Karabel and a few other students organized the Harvard Student Power Network, an umbrella group aimed at facilitating conversation and collaboration between other, more specific activist groups on campus, including the Student Labor Action Movement and Divest Harvard. Tonight’s poster-making session caps off a week of Power Network-organized presentations, workshops, and discussions, collectively branded “Planning the Resistance: A Student Power Activist Training.”
So what exactly does the resistance look like? The week was filled with events covering everything from discussions on voter registration, religion, and climate change to activist-led workshops on peaceful organization strategies and dealing with the press. At Tuesday’s welcome session, attendees expressed a range of goals for the coming week: Many simply hoped to make friends and meet representatives from other groups.
Others pointed out that now, on the eve of the inauguration but weeks after students across campus reacted in shock and sadness to the election itself, some of the initial vitriol had faded. “Let’s move past the mourning phase and be ready to fight and act,” Karabel urged the assembled students, who snapped along in assent.
Back at PBHA, as the week draws to a close, there’s a mingled air of grimness and excitement, plus a kind of summer-camp vibe courtesy of the glitter paint being finger-daubed onto posters. Representatives from various student groups huddle in one corner, conferencing over open laptops; others munch on pretzels and google catchy protest slogans for poster inspiration. Over the next 24 hours or so, these students will pile into buses and vans for the trek down to D.C., where they’ll participate in protests and marches over the weekend of the inauguration.
Eliza R. Ennis ’19, a coordinator for Harvard students planning to participate in the Women’s March, sketches on a large poster board. “Along the side it’s going to say ‘home of the free.’ Or maybe ‘brave.’ Something along those lines,” she laughs. She’s spent “every free moment” of the last couple of weeks coordinating transportation for undergrads, and the enormity of the task is starting to take a toll. She’s still trying to find transportation for three or four more people, she says, but everything’s probably going to work out okay. She’s dreading Friday’s inauguration, but can’t wait for Saturday’s march.
“Every time I look at the news headlines, I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m sad, and this is worse than I expected’—which is kind of hard to believe—but then the next day, I’m like, ‘Ok, well I’m going to come up with new ideas to move things forward,’” she says. Like many in the room, her fear about the years to come is tempered, at least for now, by excitement about the coming days, the coalescing resistance.
“This weekend will be really nice, because everyone who really believes in protecting the people who make America so strong and diverse will be coming together,” she says. “It’s good to know there are other people fighting.”

It’s 6:12 a.m. when Brian Byrne fires up the printing press housed in the basement of 14 Plympton St. It’s a late start for him today.
On a typical morning, Byrne arrives before 6 a.m. to print The Crimson’s daily newspaper. From the moment he turns the press on, it runs for less than 20 minutes—glossing ink onto the impossibly thin pages, then folding them carefully into the final product. His hands are quickly stained black. “The ink never actually dries,” he says, “it just soaks into the pages.”
George Diguardi, Byrne’s printing partner, initially throws copy after copy into a recycling bin. Prepping the twine he will use to tie the bundles of newspaper, Byrne waits for the perfect print.
Before long, Byrne picks one up to check the color photos on the front page. “I used to be able to tell without this thing!” he yells, pulling out a tiny magnifying glass to check for unequal color balances. With expert precision, he adjusts various levers and pulleys along the press.
“I used to develop the pages in trays with negatives and everything,” Byrne says. Over the years, the printing process has become faster, and The Crimson has cut the number of papers it prints. Less work also means Byrne shows up to the Crimson later in the morning than he did in 1981, when he first started the job at age 26.
Over the years, Diguardi has made no such adjustment. Since starting his job as computer-to-plate operator in 1989, Diguardi has arrived at work every morning at 3:45 a.m. His first task is transferring the digital copy of the newspaper to giant plates, which he then places on the press.
Byrne, the only person at The Crimson who knows how to operate the press machine, handles the machinery work. Diguardi bundles and ties the papers before delivering them across campus—a job that students used to do, but Diguardi himself took over last fall.
“They’re unreliable,” he says, “So I do it now.”
While Byrne runs up and down the press, explaining the mechanics, Diguardi stands by the end, bundling papers into compact packages. He only speaks one time. “You’ve got blue!” he yells, before dumping the freshest batch of papers into the recycling.
Before we head out for delivery, I grab one of the rejects from the bin. From a quick glance, it looks fine to me.
“Don’t let George smoke with you in the car,” Byrne says as we walk upstairs.
Byrne keeps tabs on everyone at The Crimson. “I call her the queen,” he says of the accountant, Elizabeth Woodley. “She does whatever she wants.” His laugh rings out into the darkness.
It’s now 6:40 a.m., and the rest of Byrne’s day is lined up. He’ll probably go inside to do some maintenance on the building. He’ll leave around 1 p.m., go home to his wife, and maybe work on their house for a little.
The early hours at The Crimson have allowed Byrne to spend a lot of time with his family over the years. His cabinets are covered with taped -together articles and photos of his children playing sports. When they were growing up, he says, he never missed one of their games.
As Diguardi and I bounce along the streets of Harvard Square in his old Ford, the heater is blasting and the car beeps at us the whole time. Diguardi, unbothered, makes no moves to put his seatbelt on.
The best part of the job? “In the morning when I get to make the plates, and no one’s around,” he says.
“That’s my favorite.”
I get out of the car at Kirkland and walk with Diguardi to the dining hall before we silently part ways. I sit down with a cup of coffee and open the newest issue of The Crimson. A small blue line marks the top of the pages.
Running my finger across it, the ink leaves a bit of residue on my skin—a mark of subtle imperfections, discarded and corrected before most of us have even opened our eyes.

I remember the first time I put my foot on the pedal and the black Ford F150—my black Ford F150—lurched forward under the subtle pressure of my toes. Lovingly called “Smoky,” the car was passed down from my dad. The driver’s seat was stuck on the setting for his height. My leg was practically straight reaching for the brake. It smelled like an American Spirit blue pack. Smoky was perfect.
Within our first month together, I scraped the entire side of the truck against a giant white “mom car” in my rival high school’s parking lot. For the next two years, Smoky bore a gentle ripple down the right side of its glossy black exterior, from front wheel to back.
Every day, Maddie, Pip, and I ate lunch sitting on the cream leather seats. Junior year, the crevices in the passenger seat filled up with bagel crumbs and Maddie’s tears—her boyfriend broke up with her and moved on too quickly. We’d yell at him and flip him off as he walked by. The windshield, a clear thin sheet of glass, sheltered us from the world.
That summer, Smoky racked up some serious mileage. The three of us drove all over Southern California—joy bouncing off the windows and soaking into the carpet. I took a 90 degree turn on the freeway one night to make our exit. We screamed and laughed because we were invincible, and nothing could touch us.
Fall brought the last year of high school and acceptance to college, but the finality of it all seemed far away. Driving slowly late at night through my neighborhood streets, experiencing love for the first time, I held Pip’s hand. Us against the world. This was never going away.
Senior year also gave me my first taste of sadness. Smoky was there every morning waiting for me as I slammed the driver’s side door shut and turned up the music, so loud it hurt my ears. Driving to school, I watched the hood of the car drink up the street in front of me.
But it would all be okay, because Maddie would climb in and start blabbing about why she was positive she was going to hell. We would laugh, our legs stretched out on the dashboard.
It was all okay, because every morning at 7:40a.m., Pip would slide in next to me, and I would be effortlessly enveloped in our world.
It was all okay, because with that car I could leave everything behind, and pick up anything that mattered along the way.
And in the end, I did leave everything behind, including Smoky. I flew across the country and left the car in the driveway—filled with the tears, the final words of break ups, the crumbs, the sweat from dancing, and the music that accompanied every horribly beautiful part of love and friendship.
On my first trip home from college, I climbed into the driver’s seat once again. It didn’t smell like an American Spirit blue pack anymore, but rather my final two years at home.

I shook my bottle, trying to free the last drops of water. The clouds were still blocking the sun, but I could already taste my sweat. Who knew building latrines took so much out of you?
It was my second day of public health construction in Darien, Panama, with the Harvard Global Brigades team. The sun was frying my arms, mixing cement got more difficult with every swirl, and the only thing I could think about was lunch.
The locals I was working with kept going. They handled sharp saws with bare, deft hands—I needed heavy-duty gloves.They mixed the cement as though whisking egg yolks, and accomplished the feat in half the time I did.
I needed a break. I walked over to the next house, where a man, accompanied by his children, held a white hen in one hand and a giant knife in the other.
I stopped.
He took the chicken over to his porch steps, pinned its head down, and decapitated the bird with a slash of his knife.
The headless body plopped to the ground. The man tossed the head aside and went back into the house. His children stayed put, staring at me.
I realized I had just screamed. Out loud. High-pitched. I hadn’t been able to help myself. The butchery was so swift, so unexpected.
I had never seen a chicken beheaded before.
Meanwhile, the headless chicken ran in circles, its wings flapping in seeming distress, its bloody neck stub gyrating up and down. The children began to pour buckets of water over the chicken for no reason I could discern.
This grotesque scene continued for several moments before the chicken’s wings finally ceased flapping, and the children stopped pouring. Losing interest, the kids headed back inside, abandoning the chicken’s bloody, deformed body in the grass.
Its neck stub was still moving feebly when I began to walk away.
On the plane ride home, my mind kept returning to the headless chicken. I realized, suddely, that I’d been running around in circles myself.
I’m awful at making decisions—from which cereal to eat for breakfast to whom I should block with, from which Harry Potter house is the best to what classes I should take.
I worry sometimes that I’ll become aimless—my muscles moving me from place to place while my brain treads water, stuck in indecision. Everything has worked out so far, but what will happen once I graduate?
I suppose it can’t be that bad—unlike the chicken, I still have a head.

In the wake of the election and an increasingly visible feminist presence across the nation, the Radcliffe Union of Students—one of the oldest and biggest feminist groups at Harvard—announced it would be doubling its leadership this year, expanding its board from six to 12 members.
Emma City ’18, a co-president of RUS, says that while many Harvard students identify as feminists, few engage in feminist activism. The recent Women’s March seems to have sparked a greater interest in engaging with feminist issues at Harvard and beyond.
RUS was founded in the 1960s, a decade also marked by activism and political turmoil. Originally, RUS served as a form of student government for Radcliffe College students, and later advocated for the particular interests of female students once the Harvard and Radcliffe student bodies integrated. Five dollars from every undergraduate woman’s term bill helped fund RUS—effectively, all undergraduate women were dues-paying members of the group.
As Radcliffe and Harvard gradually merged during the 1970s, RUS shifted focus, remaining a stronghold of feminist thinking, organizing, and support. A RUS newsletter published in 1978 states that the organization was designed “to promote the interests of undergraduate women in the Harvard community,” with delegates representing Radcliffe students in an elected body.
One of the organization’s priorities in the 1970s was the preservation of the Radcliffe name as the women’s college merged with Harvard.
“To the extent that there still was a Radcliffe identity, it was bound up in RUS,” says Shane Snowdon ’78, whose college experience was largely dedicated to feminist activism. Snowdon was a member of the first class admitted in a gender-blind selection process. “There was a lot of interest in taking on a Harvard identity and shedding the Radcliffe identity, and it seemed like Radcliffe was going to disappear,” she says.
Even though it was no longer a governing body, RUS played an active role in advocating for women’s causes. In a 1976 letter to Radcliffe students, RUS president Barbara Norris ‘77 wrote that “a well-organized committee system has shown to be the most effective way of dealing with the many problems that still exist for undergraduate women at Harvard University.”
The group’s projects during the 1970s included advocacy for a Women’s Center on campus and the development of a Women’s Studies program. Harvard College offered few, if any, courses focused on the experiences of women, leading many female students to seek out Divinity School courses and demand more course offerings.
Sometimes RUS tackled more controversial issues. In 1976, the group gave $1,000 to University Health Services in order to fund emergency abortions for students. That decision was met with mixed reactions from the UHS administration, in part because the abortion fund was drawn from the $5 dues included in every female student’s tuition.
A Crimson article from April 1976 reported that then-director of UHS Dr. Warren E.C. Wacker considered insurance coverage for abortions “a very sensitive issue.” Even some RUS members, such as Jane Rogers Clark ‘77, expressed support for a more moderate administration, proposing to rebate students the five dollar RUS dues.
Radcliffe women consistently advocated for women’s rights issues. Students Organized for Security, a group that developed from RUS members, endorsed a Take Back The Night march as early as the late 1970s, and such marches continued—a photo of RUS members in 1991 shows them leading a march with banner in hand and protest signs raised high.
RUS is no longer the student government-advocacy group hybrid of the 1970s, but today is the most generally focused feminist group on campus. While the board of RUS will only expand to fit six more members, City encourages any student interested to come to RUS’ events.
“A lot of people are feeling like...they’ve lost their voices,” said City. The expansion of RUS’s board aims to “give more people the opportunity...to feel like they’re taking a more active role.”

Growing up in Montreal, David I. Bruck ’70 never imagined he would one day stand behind the benches of a courtroom—never mind defending perpetrators of some of the country’s most heinous crimes. As a strong opponent of capital punishment, Bruck has spent the majority of his career publishing literature and fighting in court to reduce the number of death sentences across the nation. Over the years, he has defended some of the highest-profile death row cases: Susan Smith, the woman who murdered her sons by intentionally driving her car into a lake, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the two brothers who planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013.
Bruck warns that he cannot answer questions regarding his current client, Dylann Roof, the self-proclaimed white supremacist and killer of nine people in the Charleston church shooting of June 2015. Roof was sentenced to death just a few weeks ago, and Bruck was recently appointed to the case.
Bruck’s voice on the phone is deep yet steady, like that of an audiobook reader. He recounts his time as a Harvard student and his adventures as a Crimson editor. He jokes that he concentrated in “putting out the Crimson.”
“If you look me up, you can see the first thing I did was jump in a car full of editors who were going out to cover the Wisconsin primary,” he laughs. “We really did consider ourselves a national newspaper.”
Bruck and his buddies chased down Richard Nixon and George Wallace, securing interviews with both candidates before the 1968 presidential election. In 1969, he wrote a piece encouraging his peers to boycott their final exams as a movement against the structure of the education system.
Once the Vietnam War escalated, it “dominated everything about [my] time at Harvard,” Bruck says.
“We were just so tone deaf,” he admits. “The first national moratorium in 1969, we editorialized that the US government should support the national liberation for Viet Cong. When there were 540,000 Americans being shot at over there, it’s one thing to pick apart and try to understand—which we didn’t—the nature of the war and the political situation in Vietnam, and try to figure out how to get out of this and what the best outcome would be. But to be so politically obtuse—here we were these privileged kids; none of us had to go.”
After graduating, Bruck took the advice of some anti-war veterans based in Cambridge and went to work at an army base on a civilian project. It was during this time, working on a project in Tennessee, that the idea of becoming a lawyer struck him.
“I decided that I would follow up on what I had observed and been part of working with G.I.s,” he says. “At the time, there was a lot of ferment about the rights of people in the military, and I thought that seemed like a great area to devote myself to.”
In choosing a law school, Bruck wanted his thoughts and ideas questioned. He headed to the University of South Carolina, where he was “beached like a flopping fish in the heating waters of the anti-war movement... because the war ended, and there I was in South Carolina, which was a very interesting place to live, very conservative, which meant there were all kinds of really interesting things to be against, to work on.”
After briefly quitting law school to join the negotiating team for a steel fabricating workers union, Bruck graduated in 1975 and set out to work as a labor union lawyer in Vancouver. But as he was saying goodbye to South Carolina, a huge anti-nuclear protest led to many of his friends’ arrests. “They needed a lawyer to help,” Bruck says.
During his early days as a lawyer, Bruck recalls feeling “disappointed” that all the great issues in law seemed to have already been successfully won. “But oh boy, did I get that one wrong.”
I ask him when he was inspired to begin advocating against capital punishment. He tells me about how, at 12 years old, he’d read “Reflections on the Guillotine.” The idea of death as a punishment never quite sat right with him. Then, still a young boy in Montreal, he began to follow the case of a fisherman who had been hung for allegedly killing some American tourists. Later, as an ex-public defender in South Carolina, Bruck decided that he would set himself up as the expert.
When I ask him to summarize his main arguments against the death penalty, he uses a metaphor that strikes me as peculiar. “I tell people the death penalty is like an airline whose planes don't always crash—you can always point to someone who got it and deserved it. That’s the rare flight where everyone took a flight and got off safely, but just because that happened once by chance isn’t a reason you or anyone you loved would ever fly on that airline. It ought to be grounded.”
He believes that this element of “randomness” treats human life casually. Because the penal system itself can never be perfected, the “basis on which some people get spared and others get killed… is a horror of its own,” Bruck says. “In some ways, the infliction of the death penalty seems to have a little bit of the same randomness of murder… There’s a lot of randomness and some of the disparities aren’t even random because they seem to be based on race.”
Bruck’s efforts to drive out the death penalty as punishment have consumed his legal career and helped satisfy his hunger for opposition. While he still has a long road ahead of him with the Roof case, Bruck believes it’s just a matter of time before capital punishment is outlawed.
He assures me that even though many societal battles have been fought, my generation shouldn’t grow bored.
“It’s a very dark time right now for the idea that there’s some march of human progress that’s going forward and not back, but there is some satisfaction in knowing that there is still something for you guys to do,” he says. “Quite a lot, in fact.”

Hypothetical situation. You’re in a restaurant, one of those gimmicky joints that serve authentically inauthentic international foodstuffs. Let’s say it’s Australian—boomerangs and digeridoos and taxidermied kangaroos hanging on the wall, that sort of thing. A chipper brunette waitress stops at your table and gives you that token I’m-forced-to-do-this-or-I’ll-get-fired smile, and you smile back in sympathy as you glance down at her nametag. Andrea, got it. “My name’s Andrea, and I’ll be your server today,” she says as she hands you a menu. Damn, if she was going to tell me her name, why did I look down there, what if she th—“Thanks, Andrea,” you respond. You pick up the menu, feel around for the first two or three pages, and automatically flip past the starters, soups, and salads. Won’t be needing any of that tonight. You finger down the rest of the sections on the menu. Steak? Too heavy. Chicken? Had that for lunch. Go fish. The salmon seems to be the least inedible thing on this particular menu, so you decide to order it.
Things are going well—with the exception of the nametag incident—until you catch another glance at the name of the salmon dish and almost wish it weren’t true (this is a flagrantly un-Australian Australian attempt at seafood, so let’s call it the Ace Bikkie-Bodgy Slammin’ Salmon). Andrea’s going to think I’m an idiot if I say that. Okay, not a problem, just say “I’ll have The Salmon, you know, the-one-and-only salmon,” and I can avoid this mess. You bask in the problem-solving skills you inherited from your mother until you see another salmon dish in the very same section of the menu, clearly another lovechild of a late-night managerial meeting and an Australian slang dictionary. Crikey. Alright, so maybe if I point to the Ace Bikkie-Bodgy Slammin’ Salmon with my finger and say ‘I’ll have The Salmon,’ she’ll know that I want that salmon and not the other o—
“Are you all set?” Andrea appears out of nowhere. You move in for the kill. Alright, I know my rehearsal session was cut short by little-miss speed racer over here, but I think I can give it a shot. “Yes, I’ll have the salmon,” you say confidently, nearly jamming your patented menu-finger combo move into Andrea’s painted smile. Bingo.
“Oh,” says Andrea, stupefied. “But I asked if I could start you off with something to drink.”
This entirely hypothetical incident  has been my absolute worst nightmare for as long as I can remember. For the first half of my life, I relied on my mother to order for me at restaurants. That feeling of genuine relief, that discharge of adrenaline when my mother agreed to do something that must have been so embarrassing for her as the parent of a 10-year-old, is one I will never forget. It wasn’t just for ordering food, either. It was for every little, insignificant incident that might’ve required me to speak to someone I would never again see in my life. I would draw the literal shortest straw and my mother would ask for another one on my behalf, as long as it meant I didn’t have to risk slurring my words in front of someone who frankly couldn’t care less.
I can’t talk to strangers. It’s funny—my kindergarten teacher would be beaming if she heard me say that. It’s as if one of her crisscross-applesauced five-year-olds stopped picking his nose for just seven minutes, creaked his head up to that enormous CRT television set in the library, and watched intently as actors pretending to be mustachioed pedophiles lured brainwashed schoolchildren into the back of their vans with the promise of candy. Then they’d all come together at the end to sing a song about how I should never talk to strangers. If only it were that easy.
I was born without family, without friends, without acquaintances, without a knowledge that anyone else in this world exists other than myself and the mother whose flushed, tear-stained face I stared into for the first time nearly 19 years ago. Every single person I have seen in my entire life—every member of my family, every friend come and gone, every waitress who would serve me at a restaurant—started out as a stranger. Maybe if I had never said a word from the time I was born until now, everyone would still be a stranger. If that were the case, I wouldn’t be writing this very sentence that you’re reading right now because the executive staff of The Crimson would still be strangers and never would have commissioned me to write this piece. And I guess that would make me a stranger, too.
And yet, there is something so blissful about the thought of being a stranger, living with yourself and only yourself. You become a long-forgotten painting in an art museum. Each and every day, thousands of spectators look at the time period and location you come from and try to extract meaning from just about everything surrounding you. They attempt in vain to look deep within you and analyze you, inject their own interpretations of your voiceless being into you and brandish them as ultimate truths without even meeting you. But you never bear the burden of being you anymore. You flex and extend to whichever interpretation an onlooker wants you to be, from that of an 80-year-old art critic to that of a three-year-old girl who’d rather not spend her Sunday at an art museum. You become sheer perfection, a silent imprint on canvas. You never mess up. You never have to answer questions. And most importantly, you never have to order food in a restaurant ever, ever again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard researchers say they have synthesized a form of solid metallic hydrogen, a landmark scientific finding that could lead to the creation of “superconductors” and revolutionize the way electricity is conducted—but some scholars in the field remain skeptical.
Isaac F. Silvera and Ranga P. Dias, a Harvard physics professor and postdoctoral researcher, published a paper Jan. 26 in the journal Science describing the experiment. According to the paper, the researchers clamped hydrogen between two pieces of diamond, allowing the hydrogen to change from a gas to a solid.
“As we were pressing [the diamonds], we found that at lower pressures the sample is transparent,” Silver said. “When you get to about 4 million atmospheres it turns black and we’ve seen [black hydrogen] before. We continued to turn the pressure up and suddenly it became lustrous, reflecting like metal.”
After measuring the hydrogen’s reflectance, Silvera and Dias concluded that they had indeed created metallic hydrogen, a finding that has eluded high-pressure physicists for over 80 years.
Several leading figures in the high-pressure physics field, however, say they do not accept Silvera and Dias’s findings at face value. Because their experiment was not replicated, several researchers said, it should not have been published in one of the scientific field’s leading journals.
Mikhail Eremets, who studies metallic hydrogen at Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, said he was skeptical of the Harvard researchers’ discovery.
“The data were not reproduced, this basis of the scientific approach. This should be done first by the authors,” Eremets said. “In the present work there are not enough data and the quality of data is very poor. Papers with such data cannot be published in any scientific journal.”
Eugene Gregoryanz, a high-pressure physicist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said he agrees with Eremets.
“There are no raw data presented in the paper. The main paper presents 3 iPhone photos and the claimed reflectivity measurements (not raw but processed data) at the last pressure point,” Gregoryanz wrote in an email. “I do not think the major scientific discovery can be presented with the iPhone photos and without any raw data coming from hydrogen.”
Both Eremets and Gregoryanz also said they were concerned about the way the Harvard researchers took the pressure measurements and the methods used to determine whether the material was a metal.
Silvera, however, defended his findings, and said that his research methods were scientifically sound. He added he is confident that if the experiment were conducted again, he would receive the same results.
“You can be skeptical and say you should measure more samples. How many samples do you want to measure?” Silvera said. “We’ve made a very important discovery and advance for high pressure physics. We wanted to publish it at that point and make it known and available to the public.”
Silvera said that the research team will soon transport the sample to Illinois, where they will use X-rays to determine the crystal structure of the metallic hydrogen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Progressive Action Network, a graduate student activism group, held its first-ever meeting Wednesday evening to organize advocacy efforts, including protesting a recent White House executive order on immigration.
Dakota McCoy, one of the group’s organizers, proposed protesting the Dakota access pipeline, various cabinet appointments, as well as arranging activism against President Donald Trump’s executive order which halts immigration from several Muslim majority countries. The Progressive Action Network also proposed writing op-eds to publish in members’ hometown newspapers.
“As graduate students particularly, it’s easy to be isolated—in labs, in groups—and we need to come together,” McCoy said.
Zena Agha, a graduate student and member of the Harvard Arab Students Association, said that Trump’s immigration order had affected her friends and family.
“This ban that got passed on Friday has real influence on the people I care about, the countries I’m from, and the people I associate with,” she said. “I want my mom to come to my graduation, I want Iraqis to come here, I want Americans to be able to explore that beautiful part of the world.”
Sarah Cleary and Rosa I. Rivera, two members of UNITE HERE Local 26—a union representing Harvard’s dining hall workers—offered advice about organizing that they said they had learned in the union’s 22-day strike this fall.
“What I want you to know is that you’re not powerless—look how many people are coming out, look how many people are taking to the streets,” Cleary said. “You need to continue to reach out to all the other groups on campus, come together, find where your common ground is. When enough of us team up, [Trump] won’t be able to ignore us any more.”
Both Cleary and Rivera urged students to work together with other organizations on campus to coordinate events. They said coalition-building would also be important for the Progressive Action Network’s advocacy work. During their strike, Local 26 members and Harvard University Dining Services workers rallied support of students and faculty across all Harvard schools, which Cleary and Rivera said was instrumental in what they described as their success.
“It’s kind of hard to make the decision between being a Harvard student and standing up for what you believe in,” Rivera said. “At some point in your life, you have to take a risk and stand up for something that you believe in. Why not now?”
McCoy proposed that the group would have three meetings per month, one to organize events and two actual events.
“I think we’re uniquely situated to respond to this,” McCoy said. “Our expertise, especially if we combine from different groups, can have a really powerful impact.”
Other organizers also stressed the importance of creating and sustaining the Progressive Action Network.
“With a lot of us, this is our first time being politically active, especially people who have mostly been thinking about politics under [former President Barack] Obama, so there’s a lot of uncertainty and I think trying to organize under this broader umbrella where everybody can fit in is really important,” Courtney T. Wittekind, another graduate student, said. “At the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences] level, it seems like the least we can do.”
At the College, a similar group called the Student Power Network, formed ahead of Trump’s inauguration and organized trainings and protests for undergraduates looking to resist Trump.

Cambridge’s top officials implored residents and public representatives alike to reject President Donald Trump’s “misguided and un-American” actions during the annual State of the City address at City Hall Wednesday night.
In their remarks, Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale emphasized the need for the city to continue supporting its residents regardless of race, religion, or gender under the Trump administration.
“We’re going to have to be brave. We’re going to have to be resolute. We’re going to have to dig deep down and hold on.” Simmons said. “There are reasons to be hopeful, even optimistic.”
The address marked the first State of the City since Trump’s election, and the president’s policies have since been widely criticized by city officials. As one of hundreds of U.S. cities labeled a “sanctuary” for undocumented immigrants, Cambridge stands to lose over $15 million in federal money following Trump’s executive order stripping funds from “sanctuary cities.”“We will be ahead of the curve,” Simmons said, referring to the need to be prepared for further federal action. “We are being proactive more than reactive.”
Simmons detailed the city’s efforts to curb violence, promote small businesses, provide more jobs, and work with fire and law enforcement officials to continue to serve Cambridge’s residents. She also recognized city workers who helped to resettle people displaced by the 10-alarm fire that occurred in Cambridge in December.
In his address, DePasquale outlined the work done by the City Council over the past year, including providing housing for low-income citizens.
“So much has been done in such a little time,” DePasquale said.
The address opened with an invocation by Reverend Irene Monroe, who called for Cambridge residents “to work until hell freezes over” and then “to fight on the ice,” a call to action received with thunderous applause by the packed room.

Starting this term, Harvard University Health Services will cease charging current and former Harvard students and their dependents for copies of their medical records.
Students hoping to access their records previously had to pay $15 for an electronic copy. Physical records cost $2 for the first five pages, and ten cents for each additional page. Now, students who wish to access their records free of charge can fill out a Disclosure of Medical Information form found on the HUHS website, according to an emailed statement from HUHS Chief Medical Officer Soheyla Gharib.
Gharib said students can also now access their “medications, allergies, medical problems, lab and radiology test results, and appointment history” online.
Charging patients for personal copies of their records is standard practice in the healthcare industry, according to Gharib. At Stanford, students must fill out a release form and send it to the Medical Records Department. Students pay $0.15 per page for 76 pages and over. In order to request a copy of their health records at MIT, students must fill out a form to fax or mail to the Medical Records Service. Students may be charged $0.65 per page for the first 100 pages and $0.35 for every additional page.
The change in policy follows a UC-endorsed effort to allow students greater access to their health records. Last semester, Jefferson E. Seidl ’16 spearheaded a project to grant students free access to their own medical records. Along with six co-authors, Seidl wrote an open letter to HUHS officials asking them to “eliminate fees for full record requests by students,” “give students the options to view and download their full records on the HUHS online portal,” and “enable students to transmit their information to third-party apps of their choosing.”
Although Seidl said the cost to obtain medical records was never prohibitively expensive, he said it represented a disconnect between HUHS and Harvard’s other academic institutions.
“A lot of these solutions we’re proposing were created at Harvard and are being implemented across the nation,” Seidl said, citing articles written by Harvard professors, as well as Harvard Medical School’s Open Notes Study, a project researching the effects of patient access to their full visit notes from physicians.
“We thought we’d pen this letter to try to synchronize the literature and the research that is coming out of this institution with the care that we are being provided with. It’s really about a token of faith between HUHS and the patient network,” Daniel V. Banks ’17, one of the co-authors, said.
Seidl said that while the new HUHS policy was encouraging, Harvard students should have even more access to their medical information.
“Total empowerment would look like students being able to access as much of their information as they want to access online,” Seidl said. “If for any reason a student doesn’t want all of their information online, they should be able to download it for free as structured data or they should be able to transmit it to other doctors at 3 a.m. UHS time when they’re in the ER in terror. It’s being able to control your data for any reason you see fit.”
Seidl plans to continue working with HUHS on improving student health record accessibility.
“It’s really all about the choice. We’re not saying everyone should be forced to have all of these features. We’re saying people who want full empowerment should be given the choice of full empowerment,” Seidl said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Affiliates from across Harvard affected by President Donald Trump’s immigration order voiced concerns and posed questions to University administrators and staff at a town hall event Wednesday.
Since Friday, when Trump signed the order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days, Harvard students, faculty, and administrators have criticized and moved to respond to the order.
Mark C. Elliott, the Vice Provost for International Affairs who led the town hall, said administrators and staff have discussed the order during daily phone calls. Elliott added that officials in the Office of the General Counsel have been in touch with their counterparts at other universities, and that Harvard’s federal lobbying office has been “very active” responding to the order.
The town hall event was one of the measures University President Drew G. Faust outlined in a long email to Harvard affiliates Sunday addressing the executive order. In the email, Faust emphasized Harvard’s commitment to international students and called on politicians to reverse the ban, which also halts the entry of refugees for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.
Approximately 10,000 international students and scholars study or research at Harvard—more than any other higher education institution in the country, Harvard International Office Director of Immigration Services Maureen Martin said at the event. At least four Harvard affiliates have been unable to enter the United States since the order went into effect.
Martin and Jason M. Corral, an immigration attorney, fielded questions from the audience.
Harvard Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic recently hired Corral to offer legal counsel to those impacted by Trump’s immigration policies—a part of a series of steps Faust laid out in November to bolster resources for Harvard affiliates.
Uncertainty was a persistent theme throughout the event, as Martin and Corral emphasized that how federal officials will enforce the order—and whether the Trump administration would expand its scope—is still up in the air.
“It’s a fluid situation and it’s changing all the time,” Martin said. “How we answer a question today may not be how we answered it on Monday.”
In a section on travel tips, Martin advised students to carry a letter proving their enrollment at Harvard, the phone number of a Harvard official, and valid travel documents. Harvard has a travel-assist telephone number available 24 hours a day for affiliates to receive immediate help.
To broader questions, Corral and Martin urged attendees to exercise caution. Both warned international and undocumented affiliates not to travel, and suggested that they do not provide information to authorities and instead request a lawyer if questioned about their legal status.
Trump’s 90-day ban on travel will expire in April, close to the date of graduation. Martin said she is “pessimistic” about the prospect of family members from the implicated countries traveling to Harvard for the ceremonies.
The questions put forward to the panelists were often quite personal. One postdoctoral student working in a lab affiliated with the University said her work authorization will expire in four weeks, and she asked if centers affiliated with Harvard would offer support similar to what the University is offering its students and researchers.
An Iranian graduate student who said he cannot go back to Iran because he fears religious persecution asked about what the executive order meant for his application for refugee status.
And several undocumented students asked about the safety of domestic travel in light of other restrictive Trump immigration policies.
The panelists redirected many audience members who asked personal questions to representatives from the Harvard International Office in attendance.
“We’ll try to be as transparent as possible, but at the same time respect individuals and preserve confidentiality,” Corral said when asked about whether the University would communicate with the Harvard community about the status of affected individuals.

Sweet and savory flavors may be next to join the Harvard Square palette with the arrivals of Amorino Gelato and Sweet Pizza later this year.
Both are eyeing vacant storefronts on JFK St., a block from the Square’s major intersection. Sweet Pizza has been considering the downstairs storefront at 56 JFK St., and Amorino Gelato the corner spot several storefronts down, at 50 JFK St.
Amorino Gelato could come to the Square as soon as this summer.
Both businesses’ plans are still in motion and neither has yet formally contacted the Harvard Square Business Association.
“We’re pleased to learn about new businesses coming into the Square and look forward to welcoming a new pizza place and a new gelato place,” Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said.
“But so far they haven’t reached out to us, so we don’t have any information about their particular concepts except pizza and gelato, and we don’t know when they’re opening,” she added. 
The Cambridge zoning board approved plans for Sweet Pizza—a speciality to-go pizza parlor with square pizzas and a sweet sauce—on Dec. 15. Four zoning board members voted in favor of Sweet Pizza’s plans, and one voted in opposition, arguing that there are already too many takeout food options in the Square.
The Square's Sweet Pizza will be the company’s third location, joining stores in Wilmington and Beverly, Mass.
Sweet Pizza will add to a variety of pizza options already in Harvard Square and may arrive around the same time as &pizza, another pizza chain that may replace Crimson Corner pending zoning board approval in March.
Sweet Pizza owner and COO Steve Stefanopoulos was not available for comment.
Amorino Gelato in Harvard Square will be the gelato chain’s second New England location. Léa Sasportes, who owns the Gelato chain’s Boston location, said that the process of opening a new location will take some time.
“There are a lot of variables,” Sasportes said. “We need to get permits and everything, so the only thing I can tell you is that we’re not going to be open before May for sure." 
Sasportes brought the chain to the United States when she moved from managing stores in Paris and opened the Newbury St. branch in 2015. Amorino Gelato started in Paris in 2002, and now has stores across Europe and around the world.
Sasportes said that Amorino initially looked to Harvard Square to open its first U.S. store, but said that Newbury Street had more available opportunities at the time. She also said she is excited to reach out to Harvard students specifically.
“We’re going to have an official day for students,” Sasportes said. “I’m hoping we can have a student day at the store and people can get together.”
Amorino boasts 25 flavors of gelato and sorbet, and is distinct in its exclusive use of organic ingredients and natural flavors. They also plan to open for breakfast and offer European-style pastries.
“Amorino is a luxurious European cafe and gelato experience,” Sasportes said. “It’s very high-end and very natural products.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 100 students from across Harvard’s schools gathered Wednesday night for a candlelight vigil in response to a series of hate crimes against Muslims and President Donald Trump’s recent executive orders.
The vigil comes in the wake of  Trump’s executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
Omar M. El-Halwagi, a first year student at the Kennedy School who organized the vigil, said the gathering was also meant to commemorate six people who died this weekend in a shooting at a Mosque in Quebec as well as a mosque in Texas that was burnt down.
Vigil-goers lit candles and huddled together on the steps of Memorial Church. El-Halwagi reflected on the future of Muslims’ lives under Trump’s immigration order.
“I think it’s easy to think about policy, but not to just sit in the moment and think,” El-Halwagi said.
Umar S. Zaidi, a student at the Extension School, and Meral Kocak, a student at the Divinity School, delivered prayers in Arabic and English.
Reverend Lucy A. Forster-Smith, the senior minister at Memorial Church, followed the two students with a reading from the Bible that focused on the importance of being kind to foreigners.
After her reading, Forster-Smith said that a Muslim chaplain will soon stand beside her for future vigils and gatherings. In University President Drew G. Faust’s email responding to Trump’s order, she wrote that she had initiated a search for Harvard’s first Muslim chaplain, a measure called for by members of the Harvard Islamic Society.
Following a moment of silence to show solidarity with victims of the attacks and immigration order, crowd members were invited to stand on the stairs and share their stories, thoughts, and concerns with the group.
El-Halwagi ended the vigil with what he called three “action items.” First, he encouraged everyone to reach out to Muslim communities outside of Harvard, such as Muslims living in the greater Boston area or in attendees’ hometowns. He also asked people to support the families of the Quebec mosque victims through donations, which he said are being gathered on Facebook. Finally, El-Halwagi said that if other groups become vulnerable in the United States, it will be important to support them without forgetting Muslim Americans’ pain.
The vigil was organized by the the Kennedy School’s Muslim Caucus, of which El-Halwagi is a part, but he said that it was in collaboration with all other Muslim groups across the University.
“At the very least we have to feel,” El-Halwagi said. “And I think we have done that tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 2, 2017 at 10:10 p.m. 
The Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee Wednesday internally debuted a system meant to streamline the Council’s grant application and approval process Wednesday, with a broader rollout expected in coming weeks.
The system, called "nova," which stands for New Online-system for Vetting Applications, will help the UC’s Finance Committee allocate its funds for Harvard undergraduate student groups. This year, the UC’s roughly $500,000 budget includes about $300,000 for Finance Committee grants.
The new program centralizes many aspects of the Council’s former grant application process, and allows students to track their grant’s progress and submit receipts on a single platform.
In the past, students would have to fill out a grant application, submit their receipts in a separate Qualtrics form, and then receive a series of emails on the grant’s progress.
The Finance Committee rolls out the new system several months after it established a procedure to investigate student groups who may be misrepresenting information on funding grants. The committee established the procedure after The Crimson reported that an impossibly large number of students were slated to attend UC-funded events on campus.
At the committee’s Wednesday meeting, UC treasurer Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 and Finance Committee Chair Neel Mehta ’18 encouraged committee members to tinker with the system in an effort to find bugs and mistakes. The software, developed by Boucher, contains just under 8,000 lines of code.
According to former Finance Committee Chair and departing representative William A. Greenlaw ’17, nova builds on the old grant application system.
“Nova actually is replacing nothing. It’s innovating,” he said. “This really enables us to make sure that we’re holding people accountable to the money that they’re asking for and the ways in which it is spent.”
Boucher said at the meeting that the old system was “a bit of a mess.”
“[Nova is] kind of this parent application that pulls together all these smaller systems that we’ve had in place, kind of building up over the years, but now all together under one location,” Boucher said.
Boucher explained how nova’s tracking system would make the Committee more efficient.
“The big deal for everyone is it’s going to allow us to track things that we have not had the technical capacity to track before,” he said. “We can find out what the status is of every grant in a click. We can see if and when funds were deposited into their account.”
Boucher and Mehta went through simulations of the grant process and answered questions about the software to Finance Committee representatives at the meeting.
“Tonight was basically a training night. We taught the UC members how to use this new system,” Boucher said.
Mehta said nova’s roll-out is an important step for the UC Finance Committee, as it will allow the group to focus more attention on other issues.
“We’re going to be doing grants a lot differently this semester,” he said. “The less time we spend on grants, the more time we can spend on everything else.”
Boucher said the goal is to release the software to the College’s student body “at most two weeks from now, at best one week from now.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 2, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that students would have to submit their receipts in a Word document to receive funding from the Undergraduate Council. In fact, students would have to submit their receipts in a Qualtrics form.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tommy Amaker and the Harvard men’s basketball team are happy to be back in the familiar confines of Lavietes Pavilion.
After splitting a New York road trip against Cornell and Columbia, the Crimson (11-6, 3-1 Ivy League) is looking for redemption as Penn (7-9, 0-3) and Princeton (10-6, 3-0) come to town. The weekend represents the first full Ivy slate of games as Penn played the league’s last nonconference game Jan. 25.
While last weekend did not end the way Harvard would have liked—having to come back from a 19-point deficit against Columbia, only to result in a three-point loss—it provided a learning experience for the freshmen on how to win in the Ivy League, where the back-to-back scheduling of games means that almost any team can win on a given night.
“It was a quick turnaround,” freshman guard Bryce Aiken said. “Your highs can’t be too high and your lows can’t be too low. Coming in as freshmen I think we have to adjust to that quickly. We don’t have much time to kind of figure it out because each game means something in conference play.”
But for the first time in Ancient Eight play this year, the team will face an opponent who also relies heavily on a rookie to take on a significant role. Much like Harvard’s Aiken or classmates Seth Towns and Chris Lewis, Penn has relied on freshman AJ Brodeur to take on the scoring and rebounding load.
The Northfield Mount Hermon product ranks fourth in the Ivy in points per game, fourth in rebounds per game, fourth in field goal percentage, and first in blocks. With a 6’8’’ frame, Brodeur creates mismatches around the perimeter with his ability to make the occasional three, but also creates space in the paint against bigger forwards.
“Happy to see him having a wonderful year, but hopeful he doesn’t have a wonderful game Friday,” Amaker said. “The thing that I would say about AJ that we’re going to have to work against today and tomorrow is he can be pretty crafty around the basket with shot fakes, stepping through, pivoting.”
Princeton, on the other hand, is the most veteran team in the Ancient Eight and was the preseason pick to take first in the conference. Though the Tigers have lost a pair of veterans to season ending injuries, Princeton remains the favorite to be the Ivy League’s representative in the NCAA Tournament.
“I think there’s a reason they were chosen to be the winner of our league, because of their depth and more so their experience,” Amaker said. “Those guys have been around. A lot to be said for that...Going into this weekend I think they’re playing the best right now.”
The game will pit the Ivy’s top two scoring defenses against each other, with Harvard giving up 64.4 points per game and Princeton allowing 65.4. According to senior co-captain Siyani Chambers, defense will be the key to victory on Saturday night.
“[W]hen it comes to Saturday it’s really all about defense,” Chambers said. “Your legs are tired, you’re tired, you need to immensely prepare on defense and get stops to put you in a position to win the game when the time comes around.”
Amaker has always pressed the concept that while offense may not always be consistent despite effort, defense is a mostly effort based facet of the game that relies on being alert and prepared. Chambers echoed this idea.
“When you focus too much on offense, that can go up or down, especially when you go back to back,” the Minnesota native said. “We really try to stress defense and getting rebounds, limiting them on the offensive end.”
One of the things the Crimson will particularly need to limit is the backdoor cut. This move used to create open looks through the paint burned Harvard against both Cornell and Columbia. By playing close to their player in man-to-man coverage, it made it difficult for the team to provide help difference when someone was beat backdoor, forcing Amaker to shift to zone and leave the team more open to quick jump shots.
Though Amaker has made the struggles at Cornell and, particularly, Columbia a teaching moment, he and his veteran players make a note to make sure his team does not dwell too long on the past. After the team’s first Ivy loss, the freshmen have already internalized that principle.
“[You have to} just try to turn to the next page, move on to the next game ahead of you,” Aiken said. “As soon as that game ends...if it’s good you celebrate for 10 minutes in the locker room after the game, if it’s bad, you have to have a short memory and get onto the next one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The format of the annual Beanpot luncheon is nothing out of the ordinary. A coach and a captain from each of the four participating schools say a few words on behalf of their teams, then graciously wish their competition the best of luck.
Eventually, Devin Tringale’s turn to speak arrived, and the Harvard men’s hockey co-captain pulled out a written speech at the podium. Boston College captain Chris Calnan couldn’t help but smile. Leave it to the Harvard guy to put pen to paper.
But can you blame him? The Medford, Mass., native was just trying to get his speech right, much like the Crimson is trying to get this tournament right. Because even though it takes just two victories to capture a Beanpot championship, that particular section of Harvard’s trophy case has been collecting dust since 1993.
Back then, only one member of the current Crimson squad had been born. Current associate head coach Paul Pearl was in his first season behind the bench of a college hockey team, working as an assistant at the University of Connecticut. And head coach Ted Donato ’91 was halfway through his 35-point rookie campaign with the Boston Bruins.
The point is, it’s been a while. And Harvard knows it.
“I think our guys are very well aware of the lack of recent success,” said Donato, referring specifically to the experience of his oldest class. “We have a senior group that’s accomplished a lot—going to the NCAA tournament the last couple years, going to the ECAC championship the last couple years. [But] this is a box they haven’t checked, and I think they’re pretty determined to play real well here.”
With that box having remained unchecked for 24 years, the pill has grown increasingly difficult to swallow in Cambridge, especially for the Crimson’s in-state contingent. After all, as Tringale alluded to in his speech, most, if not all, local hockey players grow up viewing the Beanpot as “larger than life.”
That thinking doesn’t fizzle with age. In fact, Tringale said he still gets a pit in his stomach when thinking about the Beanpot. And the players around him—regardless of where they come from—likely do too. Because while Boston’s ultimate hockey tradition may be arcane, once you arrive on campus, it’s easy to figure out what’s on the line.
“I had watched a couple games on TV, but I mean, I didn’t know the extent and the magnitude of how important it was in this area,” said co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, a West Vancouver native, about what he knew prior to arriving at Harvard. “When you get on campus the first couple years, you hear the Boston-area guys talking about it and some of them joking around that it’s bigger than the national championship.”
Northeastern captain John Stevens brought forth a similarly grounded tale on Monday, indicating that when the Huskies won their first Hockey East championship in 28 years last March, the response was “Congrats, that’s great, but when are you going to win the Beanpot?” Meanwhile, Boston University legend Jack Parker, who coached the Terriers for 40 seasons from 1973 to 2013, called upon the words of Jack Kelley, his coach during his playing days with the Terriers, to echo a similar sentiment.
“You can’t win Hockey East or the ECAC [and] you can’t win the national tournament until you’re the best team in Boston,” Parker recalled. “Be the best team in your own backyard. You’re not going to get any bragging rights anyplace else until you prove you’re the best team in your own town.”
While Kelley’s motivational words still prevail today as an above-average rallying cry, they carried their full weight back when the Beanpot was, as Parker put it, the “epitome of college hockey.” According to the former coach, some national championship games would draw as few as two to three thousand people, whereas attendance for the Beanpot at the old Boston Garden would hit capacity at 13,909.
“No one was drawing a crowd like this for a college hockey game,” he said.
Of course, teams now have countless opportunities to play in front of big crowds, and a change of venue from the Old Garden to a much more modernized arena has perhaps done more harm than good. But make no mistake. Hockey fans in Boston still have the first two Mondays in February circled on their calendars.
After playing a league game against Dartmouth on Friday, Harvard (14-5-2, 10-4-2 ECAC) will kick off the tournament Monday afternoon at 5 p.m. against Northeastern. These teams also met in the first round of the Beanpot back in 2014, when the Huskies hammered the Crimson by a 6-0 margin. Harvard’s seniors haven’t forgotten.
“Having revenge in the Beanpot is something that’s pretty sweet,” Tringale told The Crimson. “I think that if we kind of take that token and look at [Monday] as a chance to get some revenge for that first performance, that’ll be something we remember for a long time.”
Harvard enters this opening-round date with Northeastern head and shoulders above where it stood three years ago. Then, the Crimson had six wins through 20 contests. Now Harvard ranks fifth in the country, having earned wins in two-thirds of its games.
Therefore, it’d be reasonable to call the Crimson the favorite to reach the championship game the following Monday—a place Harvard hasn’t been since 2008. Yet, while the Crimson did receive a favorable draw, Northeastern—much like last year—is currently playing its best hockey. Led by two of the country’s top-five scorers, Dylan Sikura and Zach Aston-Reese, the Huskies have won four straight games since opening the season 7-10-5.
It will then be up to whoever emerges victorious to take down the monopoly on Beanpot championships located along Commonwealth Avenue, as either BC or BU has won every single title since the Crimson’s last conquest in 1993. But both Harvard captains say they’re ready for the task at hand.
“It’s going to be a tough challenge, but we’re looking forward to it,” Kerfoot said. “We think we have the team that can do it this year.”

If you're a Harvard student, you know all too well the plight of being subscribed to too many mailing lists. Whether you sign up for them or not, you will receive at least a dozen emails per day that you'll usually just end up deleting or marking as read. We looked through the public lists of lists (yes, that's a thing) to find out if there were any mailing lists we would enjoy being a part of, and whose emails we would actually read. Here are some of the best ones we found:
Righteouscrumpets
This list’s description is “Prepubescent Iberians Anonymous.” Sign us up!
Showercrew
Do the four members of this list take showers together? That’s one way to bond…
Litstudents
The description says “Comparative Literature Concentrators,” but we know for certain that this is a list for the littest of Harvard students.
Upperclasswomen
Most lists don’t have hyphens to indicate a separation of words. Is this a list for upperclasswomen or for upper class women?
Andywu
Andy Wu is a name. Why is this a list that exists? There are 0 members, which makes us think there are 0 Andy Wus at Harvard. Disappointing.
Archaeologyrocks
This one’s just punny. Additionally, it’s purportedly for “archeology concentration communication,” and there’s one member. Does Harvard only have one archaeology concentrator? Does he communicate with himself via email?
SouthYardDems
This group claims to be “a place for Harvard College Dems in the balmy Southern corner of the Yard to talk politics—or anything else.” Harvard really isn’t that big a school, and we’re not sure if having a separate list just for the Democrats who live in the southern part of the yard is really necessary.
Salsaholics
Well, it’s better than a list for alcoholics!
Thefword-list
We imagine this looking like one long thread of students sending variations of the f-word with varying uses of caps lock and repetitions of letters.
69ers
For being some of the brightest kids in the world, we Harvard students really are immature.
Let us know if you're a part of any of these lists! We'd love to know what goes on inside of your heads...erm, inboxes. Email us at flyby@thecrimson.com
