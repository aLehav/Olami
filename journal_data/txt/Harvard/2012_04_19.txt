After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Great House War continues to escalate, we, the staff of the Harvard Crimson, have been deeply disturbed by the breakdown of inter-house peacekeeping forces. Ultimate responsibility for the ongoing conflict falls firmly on the Undergraduate Council and the Harvard administration.
One understands that the Houses may go to war from time to time, it is even expected. As Albert Einstein, remarking about the housing system, once said, “As long as there are sovereign House Committees possessing great power, war is inevitable.” What could possibly better describe our current HoCos than “possessing great power?” And yet, it doesn’t behoove one to tell a lioness not to hunt, or a shark not to mangle surfers—it is their nature. So, it does not help to tell a HoCo not to go to war.
However, certain institutional measures that were thought to curb the possibility of an all-out house war have done little to channel the energies of the HoCos to a less destructive end. Indeed, there has been a complete lack of leadership from the UC in this area—in the face of this strife they have not so much as passed a resolution against the war.
Naturally, we don’t mean to pin the whole thing on the UC. One cannot help but think that some of the culpability for this conflict has to fall on the Harvard administration. Deeper understanding of other cultures diminishes the chances of a war occurring. Certainly the strength of this divisive conflict would be diminished if all Harvard students had some sort of common space in which they could interact with people outside of their own house.
We must also seriously consider, in cases like this, the ethics of war. Rumors abound that Adams has been using pre-frosh as child soldiers, claiming they can guarantee, “none of you will be quadded.” What’s more, although the rules concerning inter-house warfare expressly prohibit the use of chemical weapons, but with all of their experience fighting roaches and rats, we worry that the residents of Winthrop House may not be far from resorting to such techniques.
Even more concerning is the fact that signs of an arms race brewing between the house have been present and ignored for a long time now. One could scarcely characterize the Russian bells in Lowell as anything other than high-grade acoustic weaponry—well, priceless cultural artifacts too, but only those two characterizations are acceptable. Do we really expect that other houses will stand by when they know that another house is in possession of priceless cultural artifacts? This is indeed a slippery slope upon which we rest.
These concerns aside, it also seems to us that the war has thus far been carried out in only the most lackadaisical fashion. We certainly hoped that when Harvard ushered the Reserve Officer Training Corps back to campus this semester, a corresponding skill in the military arts would follow, but we are sad to say that this does not seem to be the case.
Stepping back from it all, of course, the Great House War of 2012 cannot help but seem a bit ridiculous, a fact that has not escaped some critics of the war. Truly, it seems to be shaping up to a lot of talk and no game (c’mon guys, get it together), but we have to think that extricating ourselves for a moment isn’t the point. The point, rather, is to dive in. House communities have been noticeably tighter since this all started, and that’s great.
Also, Lowell should open the back gate. For real.

What is Responsible Investment at Harvard? It’s a growing movement targeting the manner in which Harvard invests its money. The movement’s primary goal so far has been to give those who donate to Harvard the option of having their gift enter a separate fund managed with attention to environmental, social, and governance concerns.
Thus far, individuals and organizations in the Harvard community seem to overwhelmingly agree that the goals of Responsible Investment at Harvard are both important and necessary. However, few have considered the perspective of the Harvard administration. This is unfortunate, because any modification of Harvard’s policies requires us to understand and humanize the perspective of both students and the administration. What does that mean? Let me explain.
I am the College’s representative to the Student-Faculty Advisory Committee for Shareholder Responsibility. The ACSR is a 12-person committee that meets every two or three weeks at the Harvard Faculty Club over dinner to discuss how Harvard will vote in the annual shareholder meetings of the companies in which Harvard has placed its money.
Harvard’s money is partly invested in thousands of companies. Every year, publicly-traded companies hold a general meeting of shareholders to elect a new Board of Directors and complete actions that require shareholder approval. Those who have invested money in that company (the shareholders) have a right, as partial owners of that company, to submit proposals for change within that company. For example, if a shareholder of ConocoPhillips wants the company to stop drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, he will submit a proposal. If a majority of shareholders present vote for the proposal at meeting, then the company is legally bound to comply. The ACSR’s role is to debate the worth of the proposals and give its opinion to the Corporation Committee for Shareholder Responsibility. The CCSR is a subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation, a ten member committee that serves as Harvard’s executive authority and is also known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College.
The ACSR was created in 1972 in response to student protests over Harvard’s investment in Gulf Oil Corp., which allegedly aided the Portuguese government fighting rebels in Angola. The creation of the ACSR was an important step forward for ethical investing and galvanized universities all around America to create their own advisory committees. In 2005, the ACSR recommended that Harvard divest its stocks in PetroChina, a close partner of the genocidal Sudanese government. The CCSR followed the ACSR’s advice, and directed the Harvard Management Company to pull the University’s money out of PetroChina.
Although the creation of the ACSR was an important step forward, the organization leaves a lot to be desired. First, the CCSR is not required to listen to the ACSR, making the ACSR purely symbolic. Second, and most importantly, the ACSR has no ability to initiate proxy proposals or to recommend that Harvard reconsider its investment in certain companies. The only reason the CCSR listened to the ACSR’s advice on PetroChina was that PetroChina had become a major public issue that Harvard could no longer ignore. Third, the ACSR has no way of communicating to either students or to the CCSR. This is why RI@Harvard’s objective to strengthen the ACSR is necessary.
I have no doubt that members of the Harvard administration support the goals of RI@Harvard for investment according to basic socially responsible principles. Instead, the real question is whether the administration will actually do something. The future of responsible investment at Harvard depends on the ability of students and administrators to understand each others’ perspectives, which may be more nuanced than each group likes to think. On the one hand, the administration is genuinely concerned over the manner in which Harvard invests its money. It is not opposed to change, but understands that compromises are inevitable when working in a large organization. The administration often does not implement changes without a major crisis to spark reform. On the other hand, the students are a force committed to revising Harvard’s investment policy for the common good. They represent a powerful, but inexperienced, movement toward a better and more ethical future.
The next step forward for RI@H is to join the shared experiences of the administration and the students. The challenge is not disagreement over goals but communication and cooperation. The administration needs to understand that the issue of responsible investment will not go away. Harvard should not rely on crises to catalyze progress. Students, in turn, should draw on the vast experience that the administration has in managing the school. The school and its students complement each other. They can and should trust each other more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sports are stupid. And the idea that Harvard, supposed bastion of the non-stupid, should fund them, support them, and even—on rare occasions—succeed in them, is a tragic one. Sports are plebian; they are for semi-morons, not for Cambridge’s brightest.
That view is fictionalized, of course. Few desire an end to sports, but many remain apathetic. There is truth to the Harvard stereotype of the student too bookish and wonkish to care about sports. As Harvard sporting fortunes have shot up—with a starting NFL quarterback and a (injured but sensational) starting NBA point guard and a basketball team now surging nationally—one or two or more onlookers must wonder what the sports-induced kerfuffle is all about. And certainly, indifference toward sports is not reproachable; some simply feel no excitement. Instead, the onus is on the fan for proof. And here, that leaves it on me. Why care about sports? Why root?
From an economic standpoint, sports-loving is frivolous. Sports constitute a sizable industry—one estimate puts American sports-spending at $81 billion. Those dollars have plenty of better uses: from malaria kits to debt repayment to about 19.2 billion Big Mac burgers. And beyond the special-sauce opportunity cost, there’s the time. In Canada, for instance, 18 percent of high school boys report playing sports for at least 10 hours per week, with 54 percent recording at least four hours. Over a fifth watch at least four hours of sports per week. At the college level, according to an NCAA survey, U.S. football players spend an average 43.3 hours per week on their sport—versus 38 hours on their studies.
Of course, there is an obvious response: Sports are simply a form of entertainment. To criticize them is to criticize every moment of leisure. But most television show enthusiasts do not leap and yell with every development on the screen; most grown men do not weep when a pop star releases a sub-standard album; and most moviegoers do not curse and, at times, physically assault those who dislike their favorite films. Sports operate at another level. In Fayetteville, Ark., Razorbacks fans scream shrill hog calls every football Sunday. In Oakland, crazily dressed football fans boast the moniker “Raider Nation,” which Hunter S. Thompson dubbed “no doubt the sleaziest and rudest and most sinister mob of thugs and whackos ever assembled.” Fans have even been driven to kill. Colombian soccer player Andrés Escobar was shot after a fateful own goal. In May 2008, to cite a more contemporary murder—and one not allegedly tied to drug lords sore after lost bets—a Yankees fan killed a Red Sox supporter with his car after a baseball-related altercation. In forming a response, of course, or an explanation, I cannot condone violence, or the drunken jingoism of Raiders fans.
As historian John Keegan’s not-so-timorously titled “History of War” explains, primitive war dealt not only in destruction but also in ritualized raiding—almost a game were it not for its deadliness. In South America’s Jivaro tribe, that deadliness meant 60 percent of male deaths were human-caused. And the word male is important. Because what is true for primal ape fighters is true for today’s sport-lovers and players. They are both disproportionately male—that accents the historical link.
But playing sports is not the primary concern at hand—playing can be healthy, on top of the driving evolutionary factors. The real question is: Why are there so many fans? Perhaps fans of all sports are a lot like parents of young baseball players. That is, they live vicariously through the athletes. (LLPS, Little League Parent Syndrome, is the term psychologists have coined.) That may be an overstatement: A lot more is going on in a parent-child relationship than in the fan-team one. But whatever the case, even for the seated audience, in sports as in dramas, there is emotion in observation. And there is nothing wrong about that.
It may be possible at once to recognize sports’ utter absurdity and yet to dive wholeheartedly into them. I often ask myself, “What would Camus say?” As I know very little about Albert Camus, I rarely have an answer. Someone who knows more than I do might talk about finding meaning amid the absurd, might see sports as an interesting study in existentialism. Still, I cannot say much about all that. But I do know 'The Stranger'’s author himself was briefly a goalkeeper in Algeria. Said Camus later in life, “After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport.” That just about sums it up.
Maybe Camus laid it on thickly for his alumni magazine (for which he penned those words), but there remains something to be said for sports. Sports are a diversion. And what better a diversion than one rooted in core human instincts, with ties to home or birthplace, or to memories of a parent’s words, to sparks of childhood remembrance? The sports-fan lives and dies and is reborn again, with each crest and trough a team encounters. That is stupid, and backward, and wasteful, and at times painful too. And also, it is fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to party hard. Then sophomore year ended, I filled out my Q Guide evaluations, looked up my transcript, and stopped. I’ve done well by my renewed focus, but as I look ahead to May of my “senior spring,” I—like many other 2012ers—see a rare break in my life of labor: With no exams, no classes, and no job for 20+ days, it will be an opportunity to rage like no other. On the cusp of adulthood with childhood firmly in the rearview, we’ll find ourselves for the last time surrounded by each other and without any real responsibilities. Bottoms up.
But there’s a problem: I don’t know if I still have it in me. The hangovers are worse. My tolerance isn’t what it used to be. Hair floating in a solo cup of lukewarm Keystone doesn’t taste quite as good as it used to. Sedate Harvard Square bars and mediocre Boston clubs are more attractive diversions these days than sticky, black-lit dance floors and Rubinoff. Can I still party like its 2009? I’ve found that these pressing questions are by no means unique to me. In prepping myself not to squander a single minute of this last ever opportunity to be super social for three straight weeks, I turned to science! This week—with my last column ever—I’d like to Karthink about my morally hazardous justification for the benefit of my similarly hesitant peers: Partying all May will make you live longer.
First up: telomeres. Those of you who suffered through LS1b may remember the word. Telomeres are repetitive sequences of non-coding DNA at the very end of each of the chromosomes that make up the human genome. The DNA copying process is pretty good, but it can’t get all the way to the end of a strand, so a bit of telomere is lost each time a cell copies its DNA during division. Telomeres are great because they stop you from losing real DNA during replication; they can also stop cancer by limiting the number of times a cell divides. Unfortunately, shorter telomeres also mean you’re an old fart who’s about to die.
It’s well known that stress—something Harvard students have plenty of—makes telomeres degrade faster. That’s no good for those of us who want to stay alive. But some recent studies have shown that managing the way you react to that stress can not only stop telomere shortening, but also even reverse it. Is there any better way to balance out the stress of four years of grueling problem sets and essays than with three weeks of outdoor debauchery in the May sunshine? Unlikely.
Next up: epigenetics. This relatively new area of biology aims to understand the way that environmental factors contribute to relative levels of genetic expression. In a bit of neo-Lamarckism, some studies even indicate that epigenetic patterns are inheritable from one generation to the next. Rather, environmental—and even social—factors may dictate an ever so slight chemical addition to a gene’s DNA—known as methylation—that regulates whether and to what extent that particular protein is expressed. Methylation is usually paired with some evolutionary benefit specific to the environmental context that causes it.
Happily for my cause, a new study covered in last week’s Economist found a strong correlation between gene expression and social rank in a group (they only used girl monkeys, but whatever). The correlation was so strong that looking at cell samples alone let researchers correctly pinpoint an individual’s social rank 80 percent of the time. What were the genes in question? Low status monkeys made more of the proteins needed for immune response because they were more likely to get sick. This, however, resulted in greater chronic inflammation, the kind of thing that can lead to heart disease or Alzheimer’s over time. The relevant thing about epigenetics is that as one’s social environment changes, so, too, does one’s gene expression. We antisocial monkeys still have a chance to change our methylation patterns and live longer if we make a few new friends by partying away this May.
But you might be wondering: Karthik, won’t substance abuse give me liver cancer and alcohol poisoning? To detractors I say, ignore the years of personal experience and medical knowledge you may have. Just pay attention to another study I found on Bing last night instead. Yes, Bing. It found that loneliness can make you sick. Loneliness—as with being a beta—tilts your gene expression to better protect you from antisocial dirty-keyboard-to-person bacterial diseases instead of social person-to-person viral diseases. That all sounds well and good, but—again, as with being a beta—always protecting too heavily against bacterial disease also can lead to chronic inflammation and its negative consequences on longevity. In fact, the study found that loneliness’s “effect on mortality is comparable with that of smoking and drinking.” Over seven and a half years, a gregarious person has a 50 percent better chance of surviving than a lonely one. So don’t worry while you’re out there partying: All the damage will be cancelled out.
I recently found myself explaining the “going-out/staying-in” dichotomy to a friend who goes to school in Arizona. He literally didn’t even know what the terms meant. I welcome May as a time to put memories like that one behind me and do college like it’s Blue Mountain State. Given the preponderance of evidence, making May a month of epically stress-free, alpha, and gregarious partying will only make me live a longer, fuller life. But what’s the real message here? Science is cool! It can be used to justify anything.

In December, Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 sang for Grammy Award-winning musical artist Lionel Richie. Come May, she might be singing a duet with him on national television.
When Richie visited Cambridge last semester to accept the Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award from the Harvard Foundation, he was struck by Leimkuhler’s performance with her a capella group, Key Change.
Richie—along with “American Idol” winner Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Nettles of the duo Sugarland, and R&B singer-songwriter Robin Thicke—will appear on the new ABC series “Duets,” which is slated to debut on May 24.
The show asks the artists to search for undiscovered singers across the country to serve as their protégés.
“It’s a new take on a music competition in that the amateurs actually perform with their mentors,” said Robert Deaton, executive producer of the new show.
At the end of the season, one of the newly unearthed talents will receive a Hollywood recording contract.
“We are actually here to discover someone,” said Richie, who traveled to Boston with Deaton and Charles Wachter, co-executive producer of “Duets,” to search for novice singers. “We are just on campus auditioning her and seeing if she is the right person for the ‘Duets’ show”.
The producers and Richie spent the day with Leimkuhler to record her singing duets with Richie in Sanders Theatre and film her walking around campus.
“She was so impressive that when [Richie] started this show, he remembered her voice,” said S. Allen Counter, the director of the Harvard Foundation. “This is a great opportunity for her, and we are very delighted about it.”
Leimkuhler learned a few weeks ago that her Key Change performance had made an impression on Richie. “He thought I did a great job, and he said he was looking forward to doing something else with me,” she said.
“This has always been a dream of mine, for something crazy like this to happen,” Leimkuhler added. “I had no idea that it would happen during my first year in college, so I’m super excited.”
Richie, though most renowned for his musical achievements, has also been involved in significant global humanitarian endeavors. Most notably, he co-wrote the song “We Are the World” with Michael Jackson in 1985 to raise funds for famine relief in Africa.
He was honored for that accomplishment and others at a ceremony hosted by the Harvard Foundation in December, and on his second trip to campus on Wednesday, he said he hoped to return again.
“I love the campus; I love the students; I love the whole thing,” Richie said. “I plan on making trips back here, and I am having a great time.”

Students need to be trained as human rights defenders, said M. Kerry Kennedy at an Askwith Forum event at the Graduate School of Education on Wednesday.
Kennedy serves as president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, which she founded in memory of her father Robert F. Kennedy ’48.
Speak Truth to Power, one of the center’s projects, creates curricula to teach students about human rights and urge them to take action.
“Our goal there is that all kids identify as human rights defenders in the end,” she said.
Kennedy said schools that use these curricula have seen decreases in bullying.
The courses use the stories of human rights activists, like the Dalai Lama and Elie Wiesel, to inspire students.
“What we want to do is help that classroom of kids find something that makes their lives worth living,” she said. She said that for many kids this will translate into some form of service.
Kennedy also shared her personal evolution as a human rights activist, which she said was inspired by a succession of scarring events in her childhood.
“There were a handful of things that were egregious and terrifying and horrible,” she said.
These atrocities included the rapes of two of her friends and the deaths of her father, her uncle John F. Kennedy ’40, and family friend Martin Luther King.
“All these things weighed on me,” she said.
Kennedy said she had a revelation during an internship at Amnesty International as a sophomore at Brown University: she realized that all of the terrible things she witnessed as a child were violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
“Students who are in chaotic situations can say, ‘My gosh it doesn’t have to be this way,’” she said.
It is the  role of teachers to empower students to be a part of something larger than themselves, Kennedy said.
She added that teachers must tell their students that speaking out against perceived injustices can be constructive.
“There are these kinds of people who are these Davids in a world full of Goliaths,” she said.

An unidentified car caught fire in front of Eliot courtyard on Memorial Drive before the fire was extinguished by the Cambridge Fire Department on Tuesday afternoon. The cause of the fire is currently unknown.
Raafi-Karim Alidina ’12, who was in the Eliot dining hall when the fire started, said that he and other students in the dining hall began to notice the smell of smoke while eating lunch.
“It smelled like burnt rubber,” Alidina said. “At first, we thought it was just something burning in the kitchen.”
When he and several other students went to open the windows, they were surprised to find a burning car directly outside of the Eliot courtyard.
Alidina said that while there was uncertainty about the cause of the fire, he was told by several people that there did not appear to have been an accident.
“It seemed like the car just overheated and caught on fire,” he said.
Edward D. Grom ’12, who witnessed the event, said that he saw the car on fire and watched as firefighters arrived on the scene and broke the windows of the car with axes.
“A small group of people went outside to look, but no crowd gathered or anything,” Grom said.
The Cambridge Fire Department, which dispatched firefighters to the scene, could not be reached for comment.
The University did not take any action other than to advise Eliot residents to insulate their rooms.
“Due to the smoke coming into the courtyard from the river, [w]e request that everyone close all windows to their rooms in order to prevent smoke from entering your suites,” wrote Francisco Medeiros, the Eliot building manager, in an email to Eliot residents.
Cecilia W. Cao ’13, said that the event did not provoke a significant reaction from people she knew who either saw or found out about the car.
“People were a little surprised, but then they just went back to their normal schedules,” Cao said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Classical Archaeology Professor Adrian Staehli, a day of research involves darting across campus from library to library.
Staehli’s research centers on Greco-Roman sculpture and painting, and requires him to compare texts from across the University library system.
As universities begin to take steps to digitize their library collections, it would seem that Staehli’s life is about to get a lot easier—but the digitization of library texts may come at a price.
Some of the books Staehli uses measure more than six feet in height, and the experience of handling these unique, highly-detailed books cannot be replicated on a computer screen, he says.
While it takes only a second to flip a page, it can sometimes take up to several hours to download a high-quality file, he noted.
As Harvard moves forward with its plans to massively revise the organization of its 73 libraries, Staehli says he worries that his unique concerns as a classical archaeologist fall on deaf ears.
“We hardly are informed about the restructuring. We hardly have any influence,” Staehli says. “And sometimes, of course, it is hard to see the purpose.”
Staehli says he has chosen to remain optimistic about the plans. But he is not the only member of the Harvard community to express concern over the administration’s lack of communication as it seeks to bring the University’s monumental library system into the 21st century.
When Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton announced the possibility of layoffs in    January, she inadvertently sparked a public relations nightmare for University administrators, who struggled to convey the details of library restructuring to an angry staff and a bewildered faculty.
As doubts about the future of Harvard libraries have mounted, what faculty, library workers, and administrators have called lackluster communication on the part of the University has led the Harvard community to question whether a restructured library system will meet its needs.
RAISING CONCERNS
Hundreds of library staff members gathered to hear a major announcement in a series of town hall meetings on Jan. 19.
“The new organizational design has not yet been approved, but it is certain that it will be different from the current one,” Shenton said. “A key change: the Library workforce will be smaller than it is now.”
Her statement precipitated a wave of rumors among Harvard employees.
“All of Harvard Library staff have just effectively been fired,” wrote one library employee on Twitter shortly after the first town hall meeting.
Despite rampant speculation, the administration declined to provide specifics regarding the potential scope of the layoffs. Given little official information, library workers were left to worry that they would not have a place in the restructured Harvard Library System.
“The cuts, the outsourcing, the use of Terms, the coerced early retirement and the threat of layoffs are all very real. If you think you are safe, this time around, you may be,” wrote one employee to a staff email list. “But try and think of all of your colleagues who are not ‘safe.’ Try and face reality. And try and help those of us actively trying to save the library system and our jobs.”
Library workers say that their alarm over staff cuts is born out of a concern for the welfare of the library system.
Employees say that the quality of library services suffered following the last round of layoffs in 2009, when heavy blows to the University’s endowment led the Harvard College Library—the largest unit within the University system—to reduce its staff by roughly 100 people.
“A lot of procedures were simplified to make them go faster. That has consequences,” says library assistant Jeffrey Booth.
According to Booth, the number of mistakes made by his department while creating records for the Harvard Online Library Information System increased following the staff cuts in 2009.
But many faculty members who frequent the libraries say any drop in service quality since 2009 is not as noticeable to patrons as the staff may suggest.
“The library’s worked extremely hard to [maintain] service,” says English professor Nicholas J. Watson. “By most definitions service has actually improved quite [a lot].”
Watson, like many faculty, says that his biggest concern for the reorganization is that the University maintain its strong print collections and its current rate of acquisitions.
“I hope it will continue to collect the world’s knowledge as broadly as it can,” says Near Eastern Languages professor Peter B. Machinist ’66 of the restructured library system.
But some faculty concerns may be exaggerated. As the University drafts its plans for what it calls a “21st century library model,” administrators say they will continue to make acquisitions a priority.
Administrators say they are taking long overdue steps to bring the libraries up to speed, including mass digitization efforts, the introduction of mobile technology, and a new grouping system based on academic areas.
“We seek to alter long-lived structures and arrangements, thus disturbing what may seem like short-term stability in service of much longer term purposes,” wrote University President Drew G. Faust in an email to the Harvard community in early February.
While faculty say they understand the library’s needs to modernize, they say that many of their questions have remained unanswered.
“We could have done and plan to do a better job communicating in the future,” says University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. “We’re talking about turning 73 libraries, many of them independent of the others, into a unified system. This is one of the most complex projects I think that any of us have ever been involved with.”
‘CATASTROPHIC MISUNDERSTANDINGS’
The University sees the changes to its library system as fundamental to maintaining Harvard’s preeminence as an institution of academia. But throughout the process, faculty and staff say that administrators have struggled to communicate that message to the community effectively as attempts to articulate the objectives behind the restructuring have been overshadowed by talk of potential layoffs.
In an interview with The Crimson in March, Faust said she thought more attention should be paid to the goals of the reorganization.
“The higher purposes of the library reorganization [have] not been articulated forcefully enough,” Faust said. “We [have] to keep in mind why we are doing this.”
Shenton’s January statement about staff layoffs was the first in what University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 has described as “a series of catastrophic misunderstandings” throughout the reorganization process.
Since her initial announcement, library workers have perpetually requested specifics regarding the extent of the layoffs. The administration has kept its responses at a minimum.
“The lack of answers to these important questions has created a great deal of anxiety and frustration for you, and for our faculty and students,” said Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary L. Kennedy on Jan. 19, according to Library Transition iSite. “We simply did not have the answers.”
On Tues. Shenton maintained in an emailed statement that the University had still not determined “what the impact on individual positions will be.”
“We are still in the process of working through the needs of the new structure and are assessing the results of the voluntary early retirement incentive program, which is just concluding, so it is too early to say,” wrote Shenton.
The University has sought to maintain an open dialogue with its employees, holding more than 70 meetings with senior administrators.
But these attempts have often been plagued by bad luck and met with frustration by employees.
In February, the University held a moderated online discussion for Garber and Shenton to respond to workers’ concerns.
Days before the scheduled virtual chat, a transcript alleging to show the University officials responding callously to questions from a concerned library worker circulated among staff.
In the chat, the account claiming to be Garber and Shenton wrote, “life is full of risk. accept and move on,” in response to a question asking how library staff can decide whether to accept the University’s early retirement offer without hearing full details of the future of their current library jobs. Library workers who saw the chat were outraged.
Days after the incident, administrators explained that the transcript came from a test run of the system conducted by employees—not Garber and Shenton.
But library staff remained skeptical. Almost a dozen library workers interviewed said they did not believe the official University explanation, exhibiting a distrust in the University’s intentions.
Faculty have expressed similar exasperation about the University’s lack of open communication and reluctance to involve the faculty in decision-making.
“I’m a little concerned about the force of faculty involvement,” says music professor Thomas F. Kelly. “I’m not sure the faculty has the force to put the spoke in anybody’s wheel.”
Though Staehli says he has concerns, he believes it is not too late for the University to mend its relationship with faculty and staff and avoid communication missteps going forward.
“I’m confident because I’m an optimist,” Staehli says. “We’re at Harvard. We can achieve a lot. As long as [the administration] sees the needs, they’ll help us achieve such things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students could see evening final exams and a shortened exam period if a proposal discussed at Wednesday’s Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting comes to fruition.
Top College administrators at the meeting also voiced support for a plan to announce tentative exam dates before the semester starts but nearly unanimously struck down an Undergraduate Council proposal to introduce a new senior seminar program modeled on the popular freshman seminar program.
At the meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris outlined a possible plan for a restructured exam period, which would last six days rather than the current eight but include three exam slots each day—morning, afternoon, and a new evening time.
Harris said students would never have to take three exams in a single day, but they might be scheduled for two exams on one day more often.
Computer science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 expressed support for the proposal.
“I think it would be great to shrink exam period by two days, even if it meant that there was a little less study time between exams for students—just to resolve the enormous compression that I think exists, especially at the end of the fall term,” Lewis said.
While some committee members voiced concerns that students and faculty might not want to take or administer exams in the evening, Lewis pooh-poohed them.
“This is not inhumane pain and suffering to have to take an exam at night or to take two exams with two hours in between,” he said. “Of course [faculty] wouldn’t like it, but what do they pay us to do here?”
College administrators and the Undergraduate Council will solicit student feedback on the proposal next fall.
Harris, who chairs the committee, also outlined a proposal to list two possible exam dates for each course so that students can make end-of-the-semester travel plans earlier.
UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 called the proposal, which will likely take effect this fall, “a huge improvement.”
Some committee members expressed concern that students might select their courses with an eye toward crafting the perfect exam schedule rather than an enriching semester-long academic experience.
Lewis dismissed this objection as well.
“If a student’s going to decide on their Harvard education on that basis, either we should be talking about...how to make students understand what the point of getting an education is, or we should just let them do it,” Lewis said.
But UC Education Committee Chair Samuel F. Himel ’12 said he thought student reaction to a restructured exam period should not be taken lightly.
“Whether or not we want to accept or condone it, the majority of Harvard students are performance optimizers,” he said after the meeting.
Administrators also discussed a proposal submitted by the UC that asked for interdisciplinary seminars for seniors.
Citing the slowdown in hiring new faculty members, administrators balked at the request.
In addition, Lewis said he thought the proposal’s goal of catering to students who might otherwise shy away from courses outside their own departments did not “make the audience sound like a very attractive teaching opportunity for the professor.”
But Himel maintained the importance of such a program.
“There is some sort of unwillingness to acknowledge that students aren’t always going to take intellectual risks,” he said. “As a history major, you’re not going to go take a class in astrophysics if you have to take that class with a bunch of other astrophysics [majors], unless there is a system that’s more cushioned.”

Debaters considered the longevity of libraries in an age of rapid digitalization at “Libraries Are Obsolete: An Oxford-Style Debate,” an event hosted by the Harvard Library Strategic Conversations on Wednesday.
The Harvard Libraries Strategic Conversations, a group of volunteers from the library community committed to developing a broader dialogue about strategic questions on the future of libraries, hosted the discussion in Piper Auditorium at the Graduate School of Design. Law professor Jonathan Zittrain moderated the event.
In accordance to Oxford tradition, debaters took turns taking the floor and delivering their arguments with the projection of a wooden-paneled Oxford interior in the background of the auditorium. Audience members addressed questions to speakers by prefacing their question with the phrase “point of information.”
Among those arguing for the obsolescence of libraries were Dr. James Tracy, headmaster of Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Massachusetts, and Syracuse University Professor R. David Lankes.
“Digital libraries will soon be completely co-terminal with the entire realm of human knowledge,” Tracy said.
Susan H. Hildreth, director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and Vice Dean for Library and Information Resources and law professor John G. Palfrey ’94 defended libraries’ right to existence.
“We need to rewrite the definition of library—and to do so with great imagination,” Palfrey said.
Rishav Mukherji ’15 and Sanhita Dey, members of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society, took the podium at the conclusion of the event. Each student represented a different opinion about the future of libraries.
No vote count was taken to determine the outcome of the debate. However, audience members were asked to exit the auditorium through one of two doors: one that was labelled “Libraries are Obselete” and another that was labelled “Libraries are Not Obsolete.”

Approximately 1,310 eager prefrosh will surge through Harvard’s gates this weekend for Visitas, Harvard College’s visiting program for admitted students.
Thanks to a number of new programs and policies, these prospective students will benefit from a visit that immerses them in the Harvard experience.
“This Visitas is more a Harvard experience than a showcase of what it could be,” Undergraduate Admissions Council Visitas Coordinator Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14 said.
Attendees this year will have the ease of being able to swipe into all freshman dorms and upperclassmen houses.
“We’re hopeful that having prefrosh have swipe access will make life more pleasant and easier for everybody,” said Director of Visitas Valerie A. Beilenson ’07.
More than 800 students agreed to host prospective students, but hosting is still seen as a chore by some.
“One of the long term goals is to make hosting a privilege, instead of making it a burden,” Acevedo said.
Additionally, to showcase an important aspect of Harvard life, regional receptions will be held in upperclassmen houses, rather than the common rooms of freshmen dorms.
Beilenson said she hopes this will help give prospective freshmen a better taste of the houses.
“We hadn’t really shown off the houses as much as we wanted to in previous years,” she said.
Additionally, larger regions have been broken down into smaller areas to create more intimate events for prospective students to get to know each other, as well as upperclassmen.
A number of new events can be found on the schedules in the notorious red prefrosh folders, including Visitas Thinks Big.
The event features professors, such as psychology professor Daniel Gilbert and computer science lecturer David J. Malan ’99, giving ten minute lectures on a topic of their choice. It was inspired by Harvard Thinks Big, an annual event now in its third year.
Peter D. Davis ’12, who hosted Harvard Thinks Big, will emcee the event.
Visitas falls one week later than last year’s program, which coincided with Yardfest, the spring concert for students at the College put on by the College Events Board.
Beilenson said that Visitas, which is scheduled over a year in advance, has never been purposefully planned to coincide with Yardfest.
Beilenson said that though the two events falling on separate weekends was not intentional, their overlap received mixed reviews last year.
“From the survey that we did, prefrosh seemed really excited about Yardfest and current students felt that it maybe took away from what the original purpose of Yardfest was,” Beilenson said.
The program will officially begin on Saturday and continue until Monday afternoon.
Visitas falls towards the end of the college visiting program season.
Princeton breaks up its visiting program Princeton Previews into two sessions, with one beginning on April 19 and another on April 26, while Yale’s Bulldog Days began on April 16.
Students have until May 1 to respond to Harvard regarding their offer of admission.

The Harvard University Police Department apprehended an individual outside the Fly Club early Thursday morning after three individuals, one of whom allegedly had a knife, reacted violently to a request that they leave the club.
According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, members of the final club called the police when the three men, who were unknown to the club members, prompted a physical altercation after they were asked to leave.
President of the Fly Club Brendan C. McIntee '13 said that HUPD responded to a complaint at the off-campus social club but declined to comment further.
Officers pursued one of the three men on foot until they caught up with him and apprehended him, Catalano said in an emailed statement.
The man did not have a knife, according to a police report, and Catalano said that he was not affiliated with Harvard. Officers issued him a trespass warning for all Harvard University property and released him into the custody of his parents.

UPDATED: April 20, 2012, at 2:04 a.m.
After months of anticipation and construction, Panera Bread opened its newest branch at 1288 Mass. Ave. last Monday.
Although the restaurant has been open for only a few days, students have already eagerly flocked to the eatery.
“I went there three times in the first two days that it opened,” Matthew O. Ricotta ’15 said.
Countless other students echoed the same story as they proudly listed their numerous visits.
Many students attributed their visits to Panera’s cozy atmosphere. Andrew N. Sklar, Panera district manager in Boston, noted that the restaurant’s warm interior lends itself both to quick meals and lengthy study sessions.
The upstairs portion features two fireplaces, a spacious seating area, and large windows overlooking Mass. Ave. Downstairs, students can lounge in the outdoor seats that line the sidewalk.
According to Sklar, the construction team needed to work around the original structure to maintain the historic value of the old building. But ultimately, construction progressed smoothly to create the two floors used today.
“We’ve done a great job of designing our building to fit the neighborhood,” Sklar said.
Panera’s food offerings have also attracted students to the Harvard Square location. Although students listed a wide range of favorite dishes at Panera, Sklar foresees that the restaurant will need to stock up on certain foods in the next few weeks.
Sklar listed macaroni and cheese, broccoli and cheddar soup, and Panera’s famous bread bowls as particularly popular around college campuses. He also anticipated that coffee would be popular, given how much Harvard students study.
Elaine Cheng ’15 said that she also loves Panera’s food and appreciates the moderate pricing.
Yet others complained about the expense.
“Panera’s food sounds delicious, but it’s way too expensive,” Erik F. Bakke ’15 said. “What we need is a Mickey D’s. I miss French fries.”
But Sklar said that Panera’s fresh food differentiates the restaurant from its competitors.
According to Sklar, Panera controls its supply chain to allow fresh ingredients to travel quickly from producers to its restaurants. “Our lettuce goes faster from farm to fork than any other chain,” Sklar said.
Likewise, Zachary G. Butland, a day baker at the restaurant, noted that Panera’s staff constantly produces fresh breads and pastries to ensure that new baked goods are on their shelves every few hours, not just every day.
Although Panera will undoubtedly face competition from other restaurants in the Square, Sklar appeared unfazed. “There’s plenty of business for everyone,” he said. “There’s certainly no shortage of people.”
With a unique menu and atmosphere, he added, “we feel that we can be a great part of the community.”

This fall, the Undergraduate Council­—in partnership with the Happiness Project at Harvard and the Office of Student Life—will launch a competition that will grant the winning proposal $10,000 for the repurposing of an underutilized campus space.
Christopher A. Devine ’13, the Council’s Student Life Committee Chair, announced the creation of the Campus Social Space Competition at Thursday morning’s Committee on Student Life meeting.
In choosing a winning proposal next semester, competition organizers will prioritize a design that creates a central common space for late-night student programming, study breaks, and wellness resources.
“It’s really a pilot project focused on modestly sprucing up a space that may have been lost and forgotten,” said Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
Though the contest is open to all undergraduates, Devine said the Student Life Committee anticipates that leaders of House Committees will be the most involved in the competition since they are already significantly engaged in the Houses.
“What’s nice is that these ideas will surface through the students, with their eye to which spaces might be improved to promote student wellness in the Houses and the Yard,” Nelson said.
According to Devine, the space could offer brochures, pamphlets, and books related to well-being to students who may not frequent University Health Services and the Bureau of Study Counsel.
“[There will be] some sort of wellness component in that space in order to bring the resources of the University to this common central space where students would be more likely to see it,” Devine said.
Devine cited the success of the Happy Nest—a space in the Student Organizations Center at Hilles intended to promote wellness, success, and stress-free living—as a driving factor for the creation of the competition.
“We asked, ‘Can we move this to the river?’” Devine said. “And then this morphed into ‘What other spaces are available and how can we make this more exciting?’”
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds might jointly fund the project with the UC.
At its last meeting of the year, the committee also discussed environmental awareness efforts on campus.
Evelyn D. Chow ’12, a member of the Council of Student Sustainability Leaders, presented ways in which the organization can better educate students about green initiatives on campus. By increasing students’ awareness of green building standards and sustainability principles, Chow said she believes the College can contribute to the University’s goal of 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emission by 2016.
“We hope to raise visibility and awareness of what we do by being able to connect with students and their communities,” she said.
Since President Drew G. Faust established this University-wide goal in 2008, Harvard has reduced its total emissions by 11 percent, according to Chow.

CLARIFICATION: April 20
At the April 19 Committee on Student Life meeting, Undergraduate Council Student Life Committee Chair Christopher A. Devine ’13 indicated that the UC would split the cost of its new $10,000 prize for student social space ideas with Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds' office. Afterward, Devine said that Hammonds has not decided whether to fund the program.

Senior Rachel Brown is co-captain of the Harvard softball team, the reigning unanimous Ivy League Pitcher of the Year and the Ivy League record-holder for strikeouts. But she might not be the best pitcher on the Crimson these days.
Thus far in April, Brown has posted an impressive 1.36 ERA, but she’s been outdone by sophomore Laura Ricciardone, who’s ERA this month is a paltry 1.17. In conference play, Ricciardone has been giving up 1.7 runs per seven innings while the team’s incumbent ace has notched a 2.65 ERA against Ivy competition.
After years of carrying the staff, and the team, Brown has been more than happy to share the load this year.
“Having Laura makes me a better pitcher,” Brown said. “There isn’t as much pressure because I know I’m not the only one who can get the job done.”
And the feeling is more than mutual. One of the reasons Ricciardone chose to come to Harvard (one Ivy coach said she could pitch just about anywhere in Division 1) was because she was excited to play with and learn from Brown.
“Rachel is a great role model on and off the field,” Ricciardone said.
The sophomore said she has attempted to learn from Brown’s work ethic and confidence. It’s paid off. Ricciardone and Brown are two of three Ivy pitchers to boast sub-2.00 ERAs, and only one other pitcher has an ERA below 2.50 on the year. The two Crimson hurlers are also among only three Ancient Eight pitchers to have 10 wins as of April 18th.
Beyond their success though, Brown and Ricciardone share few similarities in the circle.
After flying under the radar coming out of high school, Brown has morphed into an elite, crafty maestro with remarkable movement on her ball.
“Rachel is a proven all-ivy player,” Penn coach Leslie King said. “She has a great changeup that’s really difficult for hitters to pick up and very good command. You know you are in for a tough outing when Rachel’s pitching.”
Brown’s litany of effective pitches has helped her strike out batters at an unprecedented clip. Heading into the weekend, the senior has 177 strikeouts in 124 innings of work. Last year, she set the Ivy League record by turning away 299 batters. Her style relies on some unpredictability as well, as is necessary to be an elite pitcher after teams have already seen you a number of times.
“It’s good to show you have a little bit of craziness and you can give a different look,” Princeton coach Trina Salcido said. “That’s why Brown is so successful. She’s unpredictable and she reinvents a little bit every year. She’s done a good job of mixing it up.
Unlike Brown, Ricciardone rarely relies on strikeouts to get out of innings and has only accrued 49 of them on the year. Instead, she uses deadly accuracy to frustrate opponents and draw outs while limiting big plays. Ricciardone has only given up 14 extra-base hits this season compared to Brown’s 27. Despite throwing harder than her elder, Ricciardone has also displayed amazing control, throwing only five wild pitches, 17 fewer than Brown. For a young pitcher, she also has shown a remarkable lack of hesitation about throwing inside to hitters, even if it means hitting one every once in a while.
“Ricciardone does a really good job of staying low and being sharp with her pitches,” Salcido said. “We actually had a more difficult time with her. Usually, in the second game we feel like we are going to be more successful but we weren’t able to make the adjustment on her low pitches.”
Harvard coach Jenny Allard said the last time she had such a powerful 1-2 pitching punch at her disposal was in the late 1990s when the team won two Ivy League titles in three years. This staff is attempting to one-up that as they go for a second straight championship after beating Cornell in the final series last year. That said, Ivy supremacy is no longer enough for Ricciardone and Brown.
“We’ve made it a goal of ours to take strides outside of the Ivy League,” Ricciardone said. “And that means Regionals.”
If this year’s Crimson squad is to make waves in the NCAA tournament, it’ll be on the back of its two leading pitchers. But if there is an Ivy pitching duo up to the task, it would be this pair.
Asked to describe each other, Ricciardone immediately said of her partner, “She’s awesome.” Brown quickly shot back, “Ditto.”
Thus far, it’s been hard to disagree with either of those assessments.

After finding itself in an early hole that kept growing as the Beanpot championship game wore on Wednesday night, the Harvard baseball team refused to go down without a fight.
Down 8-0 to UMass (12-13, 6-3 Atlantic 10) at LeLacheur Park in Lowell, the Crimson (8-26, 4-8 Ivy) staged a ferocious late inning rally to get within one run.
But with the tying run in scoring position with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Harvard’s attempt to win its first Beanpot title since 2005 fell just short, as the Minutemen hung on for an 8-7 victory.
“Obviously we wanted to win, so it was disappointing,” senior Marcus Way said. “I think we came out a little bit flat. But it was good to come back late in the game when we were down by so much, and to get so close in the end.”
After UMass plated three runs in the top of the seventh inning to make the score 8-0, the contest looked well out of reach. Minutemen starter Conor LeBlanc had been absolutely dominant to that point, recording 11 strikeouts through six shutouts frames. But the Crimson offense finally got going in the seventh, rallying for six runs to get back in the game.
Way led off with a long double, and junior Kyle Larrow dumped a single to right to put runners on the corners. Freshman Tanner Anderson then singled home Harvard’s first run, and after a pitching change, senior J.T. Tomes was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Senior Jeff Reynolds followed with a double down the left field line, scoring Larrow and Anderson, and a sacrifice fly by sophomore Jake McGuiggan cut the UMass lead to 8-4. Sophomore Stephen Dill then walked, and classmate Jack Colton doubled in Dill and Reynolds to make it 8-6 before he was thrown out at third.
“We just squared balls up, and they were finding holes,” Reynolds said. “Guys did a good job of getting pitches to hit and putting a barrel on them.”
After freshman Jacob Kremers held the Minutemen scoreless in the top of the eighth, the Crimson got within a run in the bottom of the frame. Following back-to-back singles by Larrow and Anderson, Reynolds ripped an RBI single to left center to score Larrow. But Anderson was thrown out trying to go first-to-third, ending the inning with UMass clinging to a one-run lead.
Captain Andrew Ferreira retired the side with ease in the top of the ninth, giving the Crimson one last chance. McGuiggan, the reigning Ivy Player of the Week, led off with a single to right against UMass closer Leif Sorenson. Following a pair of fielder’s choices, freshman Mike Martin stood on second with two outs. But Minutemen centerfielder Anthony Serino was able to snare a sinking liner off the bat of freshman Ethan Ferreira, ending the contest and giving the Minutemen their sixth Beanpot title and their first since 2008.
“Ferreira squared the ball up pretty good,” Reynolds said. “I thought it was going to tie the game, but they had their outfielders in, and obviously it got caught, so that was a bummer. But we battled back, and I think that’s good news for our team even though we didn’t win.”
UMass scored in each of the first three innings, often playing small ball to open up an early lead. Rich Graef and Kyle Adie led off the game with bunt singles against Harvard junior starter Danny Moskovits, and after Serino bunted them over to second and third, Tom Conley brought Adie home with a sac fly.
In the second, Tom Campero walked, advanced to third on a Dylan Begin hit-and-run single through the right side, and scored on a suicide squeeze by Nick Sanford. The following inning, Conley singled and Adam Picard crushed a two-run homer off the left field scoreboard to give UMass a 4-0 lead.
The Minutemen plated another run in the fifth on back-to-back doubles by Picard and Campero. In the seventh, Picard added his third and fourth RBIs of the day with a single to left-center off sophomore Samuel Dodge, scoring Adie and Conley, and a Colton dropped fly ball helped the Minutemen add an unearned run.
The Crimson outhit UMass, 15-11, led by Larrow and Anderson, the seven and eight hitters, who each went three-for-four. But that was not enough to prevent Harvard from suffering its second consecutive loss in the Beanpot title game, which was held at the home of the Lowell Spinners—the Red Sox’ single-A affiliate—thanks to this week’s 100th anniversary festivities at the tournament’s usual abode, Fenway Park.
“This was my fourth Beanpot,” Reynolds said. “There’s a lot of pride on the line.... It would’ve been great to take one, but it’s always been competitive, [and] I’ve really enjoyed participating.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the lights of Fenway last year, the Harvard baseball team went into the final innings of the Beanpot championship game down by four and yet to notch a run of its own.
It needed a rally, and a rally is what the fans got. The problem? It was for the other team, and the Crimson gave up four more runs in the ninth inning en route to an 8-0 defeat.
In this year’s Beanpot championship, Harvard found itself in a similar position. Heading into the bottom of the seventh, the Crimson was losing, 8-0, despite six hits and only one fielding error.
It, yet again, was desperate for a rally. And this time it was the underdogs that delivered it.
Harvard (8-26, 4-6 Ivy) scored a whopping six runs in one inning and added another in the next, but fell just short of the University of Massachusetts (12-13, 6-3 Atlantic 10) in their battle on Wednesday night for Boston-area bragging rights.
The win would have given the Crimson its third-ever Beanpot title, and, perhaps more significantly, its ninth win on the season—the same number of victories it was stuck with at at the end of last year.
Instead, Harvard was left with another devastating loss heading into its penultimate weekend of Ivy League play.
But while the result of the game was not ideal, the Crimson’s ability to muster up a plethora of runs at the end of the game did bring some positives.
“I’m proud of the team,” senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds said. “We kind of battled back there—we got it within a run. Even in the last inning we had a guy in scoring position.... Just the fact that the team came back so strong after the beginning innings there—it’s a good thing going into the weekend.”
SEVENTH INNING STRETCH
Six of Harvard’s seven runs came in the bottom of the seventh frame.
It started with a bullet double to right field by senior designated hitter Marcus Way before junior third baseman Kyle Larrow and freshman first baseman Tanner Anderson hit back-to-back singles to give the Crimson its first run of the game.
Next up, senior centerfielder J.T. Tomes was hit by a pitch to load the bases, and Reynolds capitalized on the opportunity, rocking a double down the left field line and knocking two runners in.
A sacrifice fly by sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan gave Harvard its fourth run of the evening.
When one more walk put a runner on first, sophomore Jack Colton hit the Crimson its second double of the inning, earning two RBI and giving Harvard its final two runs of the frame.
The six total runs scored by Harvard in the inning were more than it has scored in all of the seventh innings this year combined.
“Their starting pitcher did a really good job,” Way said. “We finally got to him that inning and then got into their bullpen. We finally got to him and got to face somebody else. That was big, and we were able to string a few hits together.”
FEVER PITCH
In the first three frames, Harvard had four fielding errors, while the Minutemen notched six hits—one of them a homerun—and four runs.
It was time for a pitching change.
But then every inning for the rest of the game, Crimson coach Joe Walsh called in a new hurler from the bullpen to bring onto the mound, making it so a total of seven different pitchers entered the game at one point. The bullpen kept its opponents in check, keeping UMass scoreless the rest of the way.
“We don’t want to burn things out on a Wednesday when we’ve got to bounce back in a couple of days [in its games over the weekend],” Way said.
Yet having multiple pitchers in a contest is not a new concept for Harvard. The Crimson has brought in at least one reliever in every game except for one so far this season.
Furthermore, the rapid pitching changes in Wednesday’s Beanpot marked the fourth time this year that more than five hurlers were used in a game—Mar. 28 against Holy Cross saw 10.
“I think it shows the kind of depth we have pitching-wise, to have guys contribute like that,” Way said.

You've seen them before. Heck, once upon a time you even were one. Yes, the prefrosh will arrive this weekend. And, as expected, many of them will be anxious to see the world that is Harvard, scared that they might not fit in, yet hopeful that they'll be lucky enough to find some new friends. Before you hosts out there lose your new admits to the multitude of events and celebrations going on this weekend, you might consider laying some ground rules—you know, so your prefrosh doesn't slowly morph into that prefrosh. High school seniors, take note: here's how to avoid being the talk of the town before you even enroll.
 
1. The Bathroom Hogger. We agree basic hygiene is important but you will have to bid adieu to those one hour showers. You might not have noticed but other people have to use the bathroom too. Don't worry, prefrosh, you get to go home at the end of the weekend.
2. Hello, Deoderant. Now that doesn't mean you shouldn't take the 10 minutes you need to, you know, smell good. Don't be smelly, prefrosh—first impressions are everything!
3. The Pessimist. Newsflash: Contrary to what Harvard FML will tell you, we like our school. If you're not into it, that's cool. Just keep it to yourself. You can only bitch about our food, work load, classes, housing, facilities, clubs, and students when you're a real student here, got it?
4. Mr. 2400. We know you're smart. Who are we kidding? You got into Harvard, you must be UBER smart—at least that's what your overexcited neighbors are telling you. Just do us a favor and don't be that prefrosh who goes around asking everyone (and their mother): "Oh hey, by the way, what was your SAT score?" #noonecares
5. The (Overly) Curious One. Speaking of unwanted questions, if these are the questions you plan on greeting everyone with—"What's your name?" "Where are you from?" "What dorm are you staying in?" and "Where else are you considering?"—we suggest you reconsider. Keep it original, kids. Or at least do your future classmates the courtesy of printing out questionnaires instead.
6. Mr. Uncool. Those lanyard things? Yes, they're cute (and functional too!) They're also trademark prefrosh gear. Want to stand out? Wear that lanyard proud. Want to fit in like a true Harvard student? Leave the lanyard at home. (That's what pockets were invented for.)
7. The Busy Bee Type. We get it, there are TONS (TONSSS!) of things going on. But you don't have to go do everything. Try and suppress your over-achiever tendencies and just go with the flow. We promise, you'll see some parts of Harvard your peers who run from event to event won't. NOTE: If you end up in the basement of the Delphic, our apologies for this strategy.
8. The Creeper. Yes it's good to make new friends, but remember basic rules. Resist the urge to Facebook creep all your new classmates and consider meeting people the old-fashioned way: "Hello, My name is ___. What's yours?" Remember, that blank is for your real name, not your username.
9. The Professor. Some kids out there certainly did their research, and seem to know every fact about Harvard. If your host doesn't recognize something you've mentioned, it's probably a good idea to pretend you don't know what it is either.
10. The Soul Mate. Sorry, but chances are that you aren't going to find your love ever-lasting at prefrosh weekend. While it could happen, it's much more likely you two will talk all summer (read:week), just to have everything fall apart the first few days of school when you find out the other one decided to go to a different school. Either way you are screwed (just not the way you want.)
11. Mr. Ivy. Just as bad as bragging about test scores is talking about the number of schools that you are considering. It is great to talk about mutual experiences that you share with other students, but know when too much is too much. As much fun as it is to say that every school you applied to accepted you, it's less fun to say that every friend you tried to make rejected you.
12. The Book Worm. You're at the end of your senior year. You've almost made it—all that remains between you and your summer freedom is end of the year testing. However, resist the urge to cram in some last minute knowledge, and instead go out and throw a frisbee. That said, if you absolutely have to do some assignments while here at Harvard, please feel free to contact the authors of your textbooks during Office Hours and they can point you in the right direction.
13. The Overly Inquisitive One. Some questions are good to ask your host: "What's it like trying to find a blocking group your freshman year?" Other questions should probably be left unasked: "What's this weird stain on the couch I'm supposed to sleep on tonight?"
14. The Shy One. Chances are, no one else has been to something like this before either. Don't be afraid to go out on a limb and try something that you haven't done before! Stretch your comfort zone. Meet new people. Remember, you can always Facebook stalk them from the comfort of your room back home.
15. The Fun Sucker. It is great to go to all of the activities and maybe get into a few classes as well, but try not to take everything too seriously. It's easy to take a fun event and turn it into a learning opportunity, and even easier for everyone else around you to hate you for doing just that. Remember, at the end of the day, the things that you remember will be the kids that you meet and the fun times you created with them. You're here to have fun!

Tonight marked the second and final day of Harvard's first IM Innertube Water Polo tournament, an event that had students from eleven of the Houses and Dudley House trying out this sport for the very first time.
According to Intramural Coordinator Jennifer A. Carney, the tournament is part of an effort to "[try] and introduce new non-traditional opportunities" for students.
Many of the students took to the water fearlessly even though the majority admitted that they had never played the sport before. Wesley W. Mann '13 showed up with four other enthusiastic Eliot students and admitted that he wasn't too confident about his swimming skills, but was still excited to try out the sport.
On the other hand, his fellow teammate, Eamon F. Fleming '12 was a little more optimistic. "I practiced in my tub," he said.
To clarify, innertube water polo is not to be confused with regular water polo. As William C. Roller '14, the co-captain of Harvard men's water polo team explained, "there are a lot of differences in the movements of the players and there's no contact."
Regardless, despite limited water polo exposure, the students played well. John B. Holland-McCowan '15, a referee for the event and a member of the Harvard men's water polo team commented, "so far I've been pretty impressed."
From the looks of it, the tournament proved successful, especially for the winning House, Eliot.

It's Mather Lather's 10th Anniversary this Friday night, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Before you go, be sure to keep these tips in mind—you'll be hosed if you don't!
1. Skip the makeup; it will get washed off anyway. Everything looks better in a wonderland of bubbles!
2. Instead of denim or cotton, wear thin fabrics like mesh or nylon that won't rub against your skin. The soap is harsh.
3. Don't pregame so hard. You really, really don't want to slip, fall, or pass out in the middle of the dance floor, and the foam—among other things—severely impairs people's ability to see and therefore avoid bumping into you.
4. Immediately after the party, take a shower (or ten)! Bonus points if you have friends in Mather who will let you use their showers.
5. Stop thinking about it. Yes it might be a little gross; yes, there's potential for rashes. But like that little yellow fish in "Finding Nemo", you should go to Mather Lather with only "BUBBLES!" on your mind.
Get your tickets during dinner in Mather Dining Hall or from any Mather HoCo members. $7 for Mather residents and $10 for general admission (tickets are also SEF-eligible). Harvard ID required for entry.

This weekend our campus will be invaded by swarms of disoriented high school students trying to pass off as 21 as they wander endlessly in search of Annenberg. But prospective students aren't the only ones who can lie about their identity this weekend. Current students can, too! Here are some tips to help you infiltrate the world of prefrosh (and perhaps retaliate) during their short stay.
1. Get Lost: Constantly ask other students and even tourists for directions. Ask about places that don't exist, like, "Do you know where Robertson Hall is?" Always make sure your campus map is in plain view. To confuse prefrosh, get a map of Yale; then when a prefrosh asks you where the Quad is, you can send them to New Haven.
2. Carry a Red Folder: Everyone will have one, and you will look out of place if you don't. But instead of having a Crimson colored folder, have a Cardinal colored one and fill it with pictures of Drew Faust and random baby animals.
3. Share Your Test Results: Talking about SAT and AP scores is pretty contagious among prefrosh. Find a way to drop it into every conversation:
"Hey are you going to Eleganza tonight?"
 
“Nope, but I got a perfect score on the math section of my SATs!"
If you want to throw prefrosh off a little, brag about horrible scores or pretend you forgot to take the SATs.
4. Introduce Yourself: Go up to random kids and tell them your name and then immediately add them on Facebook. Ask them where they're from and what they're thinking about majoring in. When they ask you the same, tell them that you are actually a BU prefrosh, and that you are just getting a head start on prowling for a husband or wife.
5. Reference the Social Network: Constantly point out things you remember seeing in the movie. For example: Bartley's Burgers, Kirkland House, or the Boat House. To add a layer of confusion, point out things that were obviously not in the movie.
"I remember this construction site from the second scene” or "Isn't this the salon where Zuckerberg does the ‘Bend and Snap’?”
6. Talk Like a Harvard Student:
If you do this you'll definitely come across as the coolest prefrosh around. Tell prefrosh you ended up sleeping at the Rad last night (yeah, the Crab ended up being SO FUN...you know what I mean...) and that you can totally help people navigate the wagon routes.
