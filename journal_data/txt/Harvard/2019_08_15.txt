Every year, XXL releases a list of the hot, up-and-coming rappers to watch — the Freshman Class. Since the first list in 2007, the class has not included more than one female rapper. This year’s freshman class is refreshingly talented, featuring three female rappers who have been shaking things up and providing much-needed diversity to a genre often dominated by men. Read on for an introduction to the music of the three women of XXL’s 2019 Freshman Class — Maryland rapper Rico Nasty, H-town hottie Megan Thee Stallion, and Philadelphia rapper Tierra Whack.
“Cocky Af” by Megan Thee Stallion
Megan Thee Stallion introduced us to a concept that we didn’t know we needed, but has proven to be a vital aspect of this break from the semester: the hot girl summer. “Cocky Af” is the anthem to that summer, and Megan’s confidence on the song is infectious. Listening to her spit rapid bars where she owns her sexuality and dismisses her critics could make anyone feel like a stallion.
“Spaceships” by Rico Nasty
Rico Nasty slows it down on this track, but nonetheless provides another banger with an infectious hook. With the repetition of the chorus “I’m riding in a spaceship / 15 for my shades bitch / pistol to his ear / I’m like what the fuck you say bitch,” she spins an intricate alternate reality completed by a futuristic beat.
“Gloria” by Tierra Whack
On “Gloria,” the verse and chorus alternate between two rhythmic flows that contrast in tempo, a juxtaposition that mirrors two themes at war on the track: Tierra Whack’s insecurities about the authenticity of people in her life and her self-assuredness in her own talent. Lines such as “I ain’t even dead yet / why they want me dead?” reveal the complexity of fame that displays of confidence often mask.
“Rage” by Rico Nasty
This bass-thumping track features Rico Nasty yelling ad-libs that pepper the background of her aggressive, delightfully arrogant verses. The refrain “I like bad bitches who be raging” contrasts with the sensitivity of Tierra Whack’s “Gloria,” reclaiming the anger of Black women in a positive light when it is so often used to demonize.
“She Live” by Maxo Kream ft. Megan Thee Stallion
Megan joins fellow Houston rapper Maxo Kream on this catchy summer bop. In the chorus, the two trade verses about what they need in a partner, but Megan’s main verse flips the script. She makes it clear that she doesn’t need a man, it’s the other way around.
“Bugs Life” by Tierra Whack
Clocking in at just 58 seconds, this song feels like a lullaby that you wish would continue forever. It’s the second track from her debut album “Whack World” which is 15 tracks long, each no more than a minute. Each song is accompanied by a music video, and the visual for “Bugs Life” features Tierra Whack staring into the camera with half of her face swollen in an allergic reaction, a visual that complements the song’s somber mood well.
“Only Child” by Tierra Whack
Tierra Whack’s singing and rapping abilities both shine in this mellow track. Throughout the narrative arc, she is able to express her dissatisfaction with the disinterested way that the subject of the song treats her and move on, giving the smooth song a hopeful ending.
“Cheat Code” by Rico Nasty and Kenny Beats ft. Baauer
This song is a change of pace from the slower tracks on the playlist, and it goes crazy. It starts with a sample from the “I am disgusted” meme originally from Love & Hip Hop, then quickly moves to Rico laying down rapid bars dismissing anyone that might try to come for her.
“Stalli (Freestyle)” by Megan Thee Stallion
Freestyles are a big part of Megan Thee Stallion’s claim to fame, with her viral freestyles on radio shows gaining well-deserved attention. This two-minute long freestyle doesn’t disappoint, and it showcases her talent at effortlessly improvising fast-paced rhymes.
“Sandy” by Rico Nasty
This is a track that needs to be blasted on car speakers with the bass all the way up. With lyrics like “Rico, ‘How you doing?’ Bitch I’m outstanding / You couldn’t get in, so you outside standing” the song is carefree, but delightfully cocky. Rico Nasty and Kenny Beats as a duo consistently drop bangers, and “Sandy” is no exception.
“Unemployed” by Tierra Whack
After a brief piano intro, Tierra Whack delivers lyrics that allow her unbothered style, unique voice, and quick-witted wordplay to shine. In the chorus, she repeats a mumbled, but incredibly catchy hook: “Got a job I gotta do / I get down and dirty too / What it is? What it do? / Same shit, nothin’ new.” It’s a sentiment that is fitting for the three musicians this playlist is focused on. In an industry where talented female rappers are pitted against each other rather than appreciated for their skills, breaking into a man’s world is quite the job to do indeed.

SIGNAL HILL, SOUTH AFRICA — Relying on a thin clump of blankets to keep myself warm, I spent my last night at the safari tour sprawled across the wintry grass, out in the darkness, with a company of friends and the stars.
The day was long. Awake from the peak of dawn, our group traveled over seven hours in a cramped shuttle bus, window-watching the golden sunrise and the vast hills beyond. At the game reserve, we strolled along the riverside with a herd of teenage elephants, bartering carrotsticks and raw potatoes for sloppy wet trunk-hugs. From the vantage of a land rover, we passed by giraffes and zebras, strelitzias and proteas, scenes inimitable even by the live-action Lion King.
By the time the blues and purples of the sky scarfed the lighter oranges and yellows, as darkness smeared onto the sky’s canvas, we distanced ourselves from the comfort of the campfire — for only in the dark could we see the stars. We found an empty patch of grassland far away from the backpacker’s lodge, and with double-layered socks and blankets, we confronted the winter chill.
Huddled together like a waddle of jackass penguins, we lay on our backs, looking out and above us. The celestial spheres held open a panoramic stretch of stars, white and gold, softly flaring, alive. A shower of shooting stars — the Delta Aquariids — graced us with its radiance, in our periphery, streaks of light slicing the night sky. We whispered ageless wishes and indigo dreams, drifting in an endless navigation of the astral.
To observe the stars is to board a time machine. The starlight visible to us emanates from celestial bodies light-years away, and since light takes quite some time to reach earth, right now we are seeing light from what the stars looked like perhaps hundreds or thousands of years ago.
I sought to take a picture of this very moment, to leave an imprint to look back upon, but I realized that no attempt at photographic mimesis could ever capture the boundless freedom and comfort I experienced.
Withal, stars do not cease to exist even after the sunrise when we feel evermore distant and apart, as cherished moments fly by into yesterday’s memories. They’re always there for us afar.
