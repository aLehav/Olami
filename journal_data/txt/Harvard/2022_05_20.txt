After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not every day that world-renowned figure skaters, many fresh off their performances at the Winter Olympics in Beijing this February, come to skate in Boston. But on April 30, 17 such skaters headlined the national “Stars On Ice” tour at Boston University’s Agganis Arena. With a mix of both individual, pair, and group performances, the show was a theatrical spectacle of bright lights, mash-ups of hit songs, and mystifying on-ice stunts.
To start off the program, the entire group skated to the AC/DC song “Thunderstruck.” This old-school rock classic perfectly set the tone for the upbeat performances to follow. Moreover, it was great fun to see all the skaters interact with each other before splitting off into their respective individual and pair acts, as the group seemed to have a playful rapport that hinted at months of rehearsals and touring.
The most famous skater of the bunch was Yale’s own Nathan Chen, who won his first Olympic gold medal in February with a dominating score that was 22 points above his closest competitor. When Chen entered the arena for his first performance (set to the tune of “Space Song” by Beach House), the crowd erupted. Chen delivered on all fronts, beginning with a very mellow and technically precise routine that displayed a different side of the skater than the one fans are used to seeing.
Later in the night, Chen returned with the high-energy “Rocketman” routine that won him a gold medal and cemented his status as an international sensation. The stadium waited with palpable anticipation as Chen began, and he managed to capture lightning in a bottle once again with his astonishing quad jumps and a seemingly impossibly on-ice backflip. This performance alone, a true testament to the artistry and difficulty of figure skating, was worth the price of admission for the entire night.
Jason Brown, a skater with 22 international Senior medals for Team USA under his belt, didn’t disappoint. While Brown may not be as widely-known as Chen and others, he quickly became a crowd favorite by bringing an electrifying presence onto the ice with his physics-defying side splits and infectious energy. Even Brown’s bows were a source of joy, as he at one point waved to the crowd while doing snow angels on the ice.
Following Brown by executing tough sequences alongside distinctively energizing pop music, Olympic team member Mariah Bell was a hit on the ice. In the 2022 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Bell earned the national title for women’s figure skating, being the oldest skater in 95 years to do so. Bell began skating to a “Chromatica” medley by Lady Gaga and finished the night with an orchestral cover of Adele’s “Easy on Me” by Momento. The popularity of both song selections elevated Bell’s routine in the crowd’s eyes.
While the acts themselves did not adhere to a single theme, the combination of styles did not feel disjointed. Instead, it made for an enjoyable variety of upbeat, slowed down, and instrumental acts that allowed for many different kinds of routines. For those looking to witness a wide array of figure skating techniques and routines, this is the perfect show.
Ultimately, no skater failed to bring their best to Boston as the show went off without a hitch, despite one odd and slightly misplaced “Squid Game” reference that seemed to pander to the many children in the crowd. Even casual figure skating fans will find themselves fascinated by the feats of athleticism on display at “Stars On Ice.” Tens across the board for all involved!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From Apr. 28 to May 1, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performed in Boston for the first time since 2019. Over the course of their five-show run at the Boch Center’s Wang Theatre, the company showcased more than a dozen works, including returning favorites and Boston premieres. These shows marked the third and final part of Celebrity Series of Boston’s “The Movement Series,” a sequence of spring performances focused on uniting the American and diasporic Black experience. The Saturday matinee, which featured “Blues Suite,” “Pas de Duke,” “Reflections in D,” and “Revelations,” was not one to miss. The dancers were triumphant in their return to the stage, crafting a performance that was equally dynamic, technical, and enchanting.
Alvin Ailey’s choreography excels in its capacity for storytelling. In the first act, “Blues Suite,” the audience was invited to witness moments of tension and sweetness between lovers. Belén Indhira Pereyra and Michael Jackson, Jr. embraced sensuality as they danced to “Backwater Blues.” The pair showed that ailey’s dancers do far more than execute choreography — they must also act. They transitioned seamlessly between sharp movements to indicate conflict and smoother steps to convey that they had come to a resolution. The two dancers also demonstrated the need for strength in addition to artistry. Jackson, on his knees, repeatedly lifted Pereyra over his shoulder, each time evoking a cheer from the crowd that was louder than the last.
“Pas de Duke” was the cleanest and most captivating act of the afternoon. Jacquelin Harris and Chalvar Monteiro displayed incredible control, planting their feet after every turn before floating into poses like an arabesque en releve. The choreography was exciting in its diverse and incredibly challenging movements, emblematic of modern dance’s wide technical range. Monteiro mastered the difficult turning sequence in his solo, earning an ovation from the crowd after landing his final pirouette. Harris exhibited brilliant musicality in her solo, coordinating her movements with every beat of Duke Ellington’s jazz stylings. Her beautiful lines and fluid transitions captured the flirtatious nature of the choreography perfectly.
When Harris and Monteiro came together, their chemistry was undeniable, made stronger by perfectly synchronized movements, stunning lifts, and a playful high-five or “Charlie’s Angels” pose worked into the choreography. The audience witnessed the duo make a physically demanding performance look effortless and fun.
Christopher R. Wilson slowed things down for the third act — “Reflections in D” — bathed in a cool blue light as he danced to more Duke Ellington. Although the tempo of this piece was slower, that does not mean the choreography required any less skill or strength. Wilson’s performance was primed to leave viewers in awe of his power. Because he was donning only a pair of blue pants, Wilson’s musculature could be seen expanding and contracting as he flawlessly transitioned from one step to the next. And much like Harris, he showcased beautiful musicality, hitting every beat with movements that ranged from a sweeping change in position to a subtle tilt of the head.
The show culminated in Ailey’s beloved “Revelations.” While each of the five shows featured a different lineup of choreography, they all ended with the iconic piece — and for good reason. The only word that can sufficiently describe this work is ethereal. The audience cheered even before the curtain went up, greeted by dancers donning simple, earth-toned costumes. Moving gracefully with the gospel sounds of “I Been ‘Buked,” the dancers slid into crisp formations, landing in deep pliés and gracefully extending their arms in a smooth yet commanding manner. Ghrai DeVore-Stokes and Yannick Lebrun were simultaneously angelic and athletic as they danced to “Fix Me, Jesus,” supporting each other’s body weight in lifts made to look much easier than they actually were. For “Wade in the Water,” dancers’ movements were just as fluid as the long pieces of blue silk meant to mimic water behind them. Christopher Taylor, Christopher R. Wilson, and Kanji Segawa showcased athleticism in “Sinner Man” with ascendant jumps and countless turns.
The show ended on a celebratory tone with “Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham.” The choreography was simple but appeared impactful and impressive when performed by the entire company. Coupled with bright yellow costumes and cheerful music, this last dance was nothing short of euphoric. It comes as no surprise that the audience was moved to clap along with those onstage, swaying in their seats to the beat and smiling even under masks.
The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater received a standing ovation at the end of their performance, and it was well-deserved — what a fantastic way to celebrate the company’s glorious return to Boston after a three-year hiatus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the early moments of “L’Envol”, the new period drama from Italian director Pietro Marcello, the screen crackles to life with grainy, worn-out film footage of towns destroyed by World War I. Displaced people cross makeshift bridges and soldiers trudge home. As the title card rolls and Marcello begins to unravel the story of one such soldier returning from war, the line between historical record and present-day reenactment becomes increasingly blurred. Marcello’s hallmark style, combining sepia-toned nostalgia with documentary precision, lends itself so well to this story of postwar village life that, as he cuts away to apparent documentary footage throughout the film, one sees Marcello’s history blend with the real archives of the time period.
Marcello’s visual oeuvre — everything shot on 16mm film, dappled with golden natural light and deep shadows — is so well-suited to the film’s period setting that it does much of the work of transportation, bringing viewers into his characters’ hidden world. As it progresses, though, the film struggles to move beyond the realm of aesthetics, sketch out its protagonists fully, or imbue the plotline with emotional depth. The result is a gorgeous movie populated by hollow characters and weighed down by predictable storylines.
The film, which opened the Director’s’ Fortnight screening series at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, is billed as a modern fairytale romance. Yet it often feels like a film completely disinterested in romance, fairy tales, or the emotional fantasies central to those genres. Instead, for its first two acts, “L’Envol” appears mostly as a gritty, quiet portrait of a man’s difficult life after war. Audiences see Raphael (played with mesmerizing gravity by Raphäel Thierry) return to his town, meet the baby girl that his wife gave birth to just before she died, eke out a precarious living doing freelance woodwork for a local businessman, and suffer the weight of his town’s scorn as he raises his daughter.
In the first act, the film’s striking beauty combines with its grim subject matter to engrossing effect, carefully documenting Raphael’s life. In the standout opening scene, Raphael walks into town in his military uniform— at this point cutting an unfamiliar, grizzled figure — and receives a tense welcome from his old neighbor Adaline (Noémi Lvovsky), who brusquely introduces him to the newborn she’s been caring for since his wife’s death: his daughter, Juliette. Very little is actually said here — but as the camera dwells on Raphael’s weary face, on his hands grabbing up slices of bread, on Juliette standing to rock the newborn behind him as he hesitates to look at her — the audience sees what it needs to know. Crucial to the story are Raphael’s paralyzing grief, Adaline’s loyalty to his wife, and the unavoidable task of raising his child alone. Marcello’s exacting direction and technical prowess shine in this moment, and the scene’s silence matches Raphael’s characteristic wordlessness.
But soon after, the film’s wordless minimalism becomes a limitation. As it unfolds in stitched-together, sparse scenes of village life, economic tribulations, public cruelty against Raphael and Juliette, and historical footage, its characters fade into archetypal outcasts without any complicating nuance or emotional dimensions.
The few insights given into their inner lives suggest simple motivations: Raphael wants his daughter to receive an education and transcend the town, but she doesn’t want to leave him behind. The audience barely sees her go anywhere, except brief shots of her riding a train to an unseen school, and she never gains any real distance — which explains why, in her later years, she yearns for excitement. When an older Juliette (Juliette Jouard) encounters Jean (Louis Garrel), an amateur pilot with a gambling problem, she’s infatuated. As the film pivots into a focus about Juliette as a young woman, it suddenly takes on a brighter look and jarringly dreamy tone, becoming almost unrecognizable from the first half. In one characteristically pretty shot, Juliette floats in a tranquil river and begins to sing a musical number. As her voice warbles through the woods, the surreally fantastical tone (reminiscent of “The Young Girls of Rochefort”) is jarring.
One could accept the transformation, though, if the film pursued its new romantic direction fully, forsaking its minimalistic character development for a deeper exploration of Juliette and her beloved Jean’s connection. Instead, it maintains a distant gaze, relying on rushed cliches of romance that make their great affair hard to believe in. After the couple nervously kisses for the first time, the scene suddenly cuts away to a shot of them laying in the high grass as Jean tells Juliette pensively, “I was a solitary child.” The romance that was supposed to guide the film, building in the whimsical optimism of a fairy tale, instead feels skeletal. It is reduced to a matching of two characters with good chemistry (owing to engaging performances by Jouard and Garrel) but few moments of substantive understanding onscreen.
This issue speaks to the film’s larger problem: though it benefits from great performances and Marcello’s flawless visual technique, its characters lack heart (or, if they have it, the audience doesn’t see that.) The film starts strong as a striking slice-of-life film, but as it transitions into a brighter romance, it has the trappings of a fairytale in the form of framing archetypes that ultimately don’t seem to go anywhere. (The outcast father, his good-natured and beautiful daughter, her doting godmother, her charming suitor, an evil boss, a village wandering-woman are all present.) It lacks the romantic depth of Marcello’s previous film “Martin Eden,” which dwelled on the growing connection between its main couple, and its documentary montage style prevents emotional continuity that could have made it more impactful. Ultimately, the romance feels like a marriage of stereotypes rather than a portrait of true love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana lauded the importance of the University’s landmark Legacy of Slavery report in a Thursday interview.
The Legacy of Slavery report, a long-awaited University initiative examining Harvard’s ties to slavery, detailed how slavery “powerfully shaped Harvard.” Released last month, the report found that Harvard faculty, staff, and leaders enslaved more than 70 Black and Indigenous people over about 150 years.
Following the report, Khurana said it was crucial for the College to “incorporate this history” as part of its “narrative.”
“We have to recognize that the legacy of slavery continues to this day and is manifest in a variety of social institutions and practices that are often uncontested,” Khurana said.
Khurana also said the College recognizes the “entanglement” that the nation has had with enslavement of both Black and Indigenous people.
“The report is really important to remind us of those origins and also the imprint that founding conditions have on an institution even centuries later,” Khurana said. “We have to acknowledge the wealth that was acquired during the enslavement of people as well as how it was transferred.”
“That’s part of our history,” he added.
Earlier this month, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay introduced an FAS denaming process for removing controversial names and titles — the first initiative to address the Legacy of Slavery report. The University has also committed $100 million to redress its ties to slavery.
Khurana said he has been inspired by the advocacy and leadership efforts of students in the wake of the report.
“‘Veritas’ is about preferring and living with an uncomfortable truth over a comfortable lie,” Khurana said. “What gave me hope was to see the role of our students and our community countering oppressive institutions and challenging racist ideas.”
Khurana also addressed the following topics in the interview:
Student Rallies on Abortion Rights
In response to a leaked Supreme Court draft majority opinion that would strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, Harvard students staged a series of rallies about abortion earlier this month. Around 100 Harvard students demonstrated in support of abortion rights outside Memorial Church while a smaller group gathered nearby in counterprotest.
Khurana said the College recognizes the importance of the “plurality of perspectives” on issues on Harvard’s campus.
“We want our students to engage and express their views,” Khurana said. “We also encourage engagement in a variety of ways through voting, through encouraging people to advance their beliefs both on and off campus and use the tools of free expression.”
While he declined to comment on the implications of the draft opinion, Khurana said the College continues to support students “in ways they need.”
Reflections on the 2021-2022 Academic Year
Khurana called the past academic year — the first fully on-campus year since 2018-2019 — both “wonderful” and “hard.”
Though he cited a number of stressors for students over the past year, including the war in Ukraine and the threat of climate change, he expressed cautious optimism about the future.
“There’s so many challenges our world faces,” Khurana said. “Things are gonna get better. I see signs of hope and possibility everywhere on these issues.”
