After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“Don’t go to Governors Ball! Turn around! It fucking sucks!”
 
This is a bad omen. I’m walking on the Triboro bridge en route to the mammoth three-day music festival Governors Ball, getting mentally prepared for the best weekend of my life, yet dozens of teenagers are staggering the opposite direction, splattered with mud and screaming obscenities. Rain is coming down hard, and from what we can see from the bridge, there’s a lot more murky brown than green on the Randall’s Island lawns. It appears we’re heading directly towards Altamont 2013.
 
Thankfully, the Hells Angels never materialized during the 21 hours I was there, nor did the bad vibes with which those teenagers left on Friday afternoon. Weather notwithstanding, Governors Ball was a crisply executed, well-attended, and superbly performed commuters festival. It will likely be remembered as the day that launched a new chapter of Kanye West’s storied career, but other artists inspired throughout the weekend.
 
Friday
 
The fate of the festival is still unknown when my friend Jeremy and I cross the bridge to Randall’s Island for the first time. Although we try to step gingerly through the swampy mess, our shoes are soaked through by the time we get to the sweaty, humid tent where electronic duo Crystal Castles are playing. Attempting to dance only results in splashing and me promptly getting called an asshole. I meekly nod my head along for the rest of the time, even though vocalist Alice Glass jumps up and down ferociously, and the vicious, seizing beats reverberate through my chest.
 
Things get glummer when Jeremy and I wait for an hour for who we think is soul queen Erykah Badu, but actually turns out to be Beach House. We had an argument beforehand over who to see—I’ve always been bored with Beach House’s guitar drones and was itching for Badu’s neo-soul theatrics. We end up with the former on pure accident, and despite my best efforts be close-minded, poncho-clad singer Victoria Legrand sounds majestic, and the whirling keyboards fit the epic, delirious mood of the night. The few songs that we catch are enough to take us home riding a chilling high of admiration.
 
Beach House stayed on for less than twenty minutes before succumbing to the dangerously high winds and whipping rain. The rest of the night was officially suspended: headliners Kings of Leon were postponed, and DJ Pretty Lights was cancelled altogether.
 
Saturday
 
Storminess recedes into clear skies the next morning, and I take off early to catch an assortment of smaller acts, the most memorable of which proves to be Detroit DJ GRiZ. GRiZ an average-looking hipster with with laughably impeccable diction: “New York, we’re going to take this to the next motherfucking level,” he states carefully. But his ’70s soul samples, combined with the usual dubstep fare of screechy electro-whines and blitzing hi-hats, makes the early afternoon crowd go nuts. This audience is fairly representative of the larger population here: high schoolers and 20-somethings who dress up in what my friend Jenna terms “festival fashion,” bro tanks or jerseys and Ray-Bans for the dudes, cut-up sleeveless tees, khaki short-shorts and colorful headbands/bracelets/necklaces for the girls. For a look that’s designed to be alternative, it’s overwhelmingly standard here. You can usually tell how far out somebody actually is, though, by how unconventionally they dance and flail. Here, a couple girls spin wildly in circles, and one guy dons a horse head mask and gets up on his friend’s shoulders to pumps his fists wildly. It’s a good crowd.
 
If GRiZ relies on hormones, then the Dirty Projectors are fueled by intellect. Jenna hates them—without prior listening, it’s tough to understand all the moving parts, the “bird-like” shrieks, the indecipherable lyrics. The Projectors are a little obtuse, but also possibly America’s smartest band right now, combining deep songwriting craft with absurd vocal arrangements. Their recent single “Gun Has No Trigger” gives me chills with each throbbing climax.
 
The set also presents a fascinating study into the cohesion of two opposites. Gangly frontman David Longstreth rarely smiles or engages with anyone, instead shredding his voice to bits with scream after guttural scream. Sidekick Amber Coffman is all grace and precision, bantering bashfully with the crowd and swaying from side to side on her feature, “Stillness is the Move.” When put together, they form a whole new jagged, textured animal, as shown on the immersive 2009 cut “Useful Chamber.”
 
I’m pondering profound musical thoughts as I leave Longstreth, Coffman & co., but those all get thrown out the window when the next performer takes the stage. Good god, Azealia Banks. To use words like “carnal,” “dominant,” and “exhausting” doesn’t come close to capture the kind of energy she brought Saturday night. She explodes onto the stage in a bright orange Spandex suit, already dancing and screaming. This is the only show I’ve been to where the crowd goes berserk three times, first for her version of Baauer’s omnipresent “Harlem Shake”—the overhead tent trembles during the drop—for her homecoming anthem “212,” and for the encore. As she turns and runs off, men and women left and right assume wide-eyed, stunned expressions: we’re all physically and mentally drained. I run into my friend Michael, whose jaw is practically on the floor. “That was so sick,” is all he can muster.
 
Dazed, we trudge over to Kings of Leon on the mainstage, who provide exactly the vibe we need. It’s still sunny outside, and a mix of younger and older fans are milling about, some watching the band avidly, others just taking in the good weather. That’s fine: Kings of Leon doesn’t necessitate full attention, as their songs all seem vaguely familiar.
 
We’re still thinking about Azealia by the time we get to rapper Kendrick Lamar’s set, while he’s in the middle of his pillow-talk hit “Poetic Justice.” It’s probably wrong to compare the two, because their artistic goals are so different, but I can’t help but notice that where Azealia shouted every rapid-fire syllable, Kendrick skips half of his words and waltzes around in cruise mode. Even worse, he introduces “Swimming Pools (Drank)” as if it’s actually a drinking anthem and not a critique, gleefully encouraging everyone to “get fucked up” and sing along.
 
It’s clear that many followed his advice as he wraps up with a long-winded speech about Compton. It’s only 8:30, with the legendary Guns N’ Roses still to go, but hundreds are staggering through the mud to the exits, some slurring their speech, some crying. This is the only moment of the festival where the scene is dystopic: tank-clad bros guzzling beer and fighting with their girlfriends as their Gucci sandals get entrenched in the mud. We head home with the crowd, thoroughly exhausted and in desperate need of a change of shoes. From what we heard afterward, GnR involved a lot of flames, fireworks, double-necked guitar theatrics—we’re not too bummed over missing the pageantry.
 
Sunday
 
By day three, I’m fed up with buying $14 Fosters and $9 tacos. I’ve also figured out how to game the security guards, and we easily sneak in supplies to last the day. We munch on our deli sandwiches and sip Red Bull while Deerhunter plays hazy alt-rock through distorted speakers. They’re not very good showmen—“That’s just a little nerdy guy,” my friend Haley says dismissively of lead singer Bradford Cox—but their circular bass patterns and enveloping feedback are hypnotic.
 
Of course, the artist we really came to see today is Kanye, so we decide to skip out on a bunch of quality acts—sorry to the xx, Yeasayer, and Beirut—in order to camp out at the Mainstage from 4 p.m. on. (By the way, I’ve skipped over a bunch of artists that I saw but have very little to say about. MS MR, Young the Giant, Portugal.The Man, and Alt-J all were perfectly fun.) We stand through Foals and Grizzly Bear, two great bands, but through both sets, the crowd holds Kanye bigheads aloft and screams his name. Grizzly Bear frontman Ed Droste acknowledges this, asking if there’s an extra Kanye sign for when he joins us. There’s really little you can do to win the crowd when you’re opening for a man who is naming his next album “Yeezus.”
 
Before the man himself comes out, a huge screen above the stage goes ablaze with blinking lights: three snarling dogs bare down on the audience, their blinding teeth practically popping out of the screen, their savage barks puncturing the ear drums. They’re pretty terrifying, but harmless compared to when West emerges slowly to the rumbling synthesizers of “Black Skinhead.” The dogs are replaced by giant images of West in a black KKK robe, staring unblinkingly out into the masses; a whirlwind of grainy advertisements flash across the screen as he howls, “four in the morning, and I’m zoning / Think I’m possessed, it’s an omen” into the feedback-crazy microphone. The experience is horrific, but not in a negative way—rather, he’s found a way to channel simple images, an 808 machine, and his distorted voice into complete, visceral horror.
It’s clear that the backpacked, pink-poloed good kid is now something of a societal and artistic menace. The beats are as synthetic and abrasive as can be. The clothes are no longer laughably extravagant, but disconcertingly bare. He’s surlier than ever: it seems he never makes eye contact with his fans once, instead scanning above the crowd and into the lights. Mostly, he just looks back at the giant screen, staring wide-eyed at the psychedelic images of his own face.
 
The highlight of the set perhaps comes when he premieres his new song “I Am a God.” “I just talked to Jesus / He said, ‘what up, Yeezus?’” he boasts. Kanye’s self-obsession is mostly disgusting, but it’s a little hard to not believe his claims of supremacy when he’s five feet away from me, standing jauntily and surveying the mass of thousands of people below him, while they all throw up Roc-A-Fella Records signs and scream his name. The hero worship in this moment is a dark, twisted, awesome spectacle to behold.
 
After running through some old party classics (“Good Life,” “All Falls Down”), Kanye ends his set with a reprise of the creeping new track “New Slaves,” the hooded figures reappear, and Kanye walks off without a word. My throat is absolutely shot from three days of screaming, so I’m left to wonder to myself just what kind of monster we’ve created.
 
Governors Ball was a monster of another kind. It was a drenched, gut-punched monster that took a couple days to really rear back its head. And once it did, the diversity and grandiosity made it nearly overwhelming. To all the tank bros and hipster chicks, see you next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a May 30 Crimson article, Steven S. Lee and Dev A. Patel addressed the challenges students face when taking mental health leaves from the college.  The article says, "For a handful of students each year, Harvard’s environment is too much to bear. In search of wellness, these undergraduates leave Harvard, returning home to a world without the worries of college life.”
As someone about to return from medical leave, I wish to address what I feel are some serious misunderstandings embedded in the above statement.
People do not take medical leaves because “Harvard’s environment is too much to bear.”  Saying this implies that those who do so are “less than,” that they do not measure up to the majority of students who complete Harvard in four years’ time. Although it may not have been the writers’ intention, as a student who took a leave of absence on account of anorexia and depression, this was the sentiment I perceived.
I did not leave the college because I could not cope with the “worries of college life.”  Quite the opposite—I wanted desperately to engage in the worries of college life. I tried to care about papers, attend every meeting or rehearsal, and date.  No matter how hard I tried, however, I could not go 20 minutes without obsessively counting calories or trying on a costume without wanting to vomit. I could not look out of a third floor window of Lamont without contemplating hurling myself through the glass—anything that would distract me from my prison of self-invalidating thoughts. There was something broken inside of me.
When it became clear that I could no longer function as a person, let alone as a Harvard student, I returned to “a world without the worries of college life.”
It was horrendous.
Before and during my time at Harvard, I had felt as though my own thoughts were eating away at me from the inside.  But the social interactions and continuous mental stimulation Harvard provided prevented me from falling wholly and completely into the grip of my own frightening emotions. Driving away from Cambridge, I felt completely lost.  Away from school, a feeling of intellectual atrophy joined my cannibalistic thoughts.
The combination of the two was unbearable; two hours after stepping out of my family’s car, I was feverishly scouring the Internet for jobs.  I wrote cover letter after cover letter hoping to feel, at least for a moment, that rush of being a Harvard student on a mission.
A week-and-a-half later, I’d landed a job.  Three-and-a-half weeks later, I’d grown bored;  nothing could replace the constant intellectual challenges and opportunities that make Harvard unique. And so I began the application process to return for the spring semester.
Despite the rule that students on mental health leave must take a full six-month absence, a rule of which I had not been informed until after taking leave, I was determined and well-nourished. How could Harvard say “no”?
A 12-page re-application essay and an hour-and-a-half long interview later, Harvard said “no.”
Feeling cut off from my peers and desperately wanting to reactivate my crumbling neuro-pathways, I took a challenging job in a new city right as summer application season hit, satisfying my need for invigorating stress.
Soon after I’d settled into a new balancing act, it was time to re-re-apply to Harvard.  After several phone calls during which I assured a UHS Mental Health representative that I was not trying to waste the University’s time, I realized that if I was going to convince these people to let me back in, I probably needed to figure out why I had left in the first place.
In that moment the answer hit me: I wanted to go back, but I wasn’t positive that I deserved to go back.  More than that, I realized that I had never felt that I deserved to attend Harvard.  After the acceptance letter euphoria had dwindled, I had convinced myself that my admission was a major fluke. “You have absolutely no intelligence and no potential,” I repeatedly told myself, “Maybe if you are skinny enough, no one will notice that you have nothing to offer.”
While on leave, I attended an event where a man to whom I had just been introduced decided to spend the entire evening loudly and explicitly theorizing, to anyone who would listen, the various reasons a “girl like me” could possibly have been admitted to Harvard– none of which related to my intellect or Pollyanna idealism.  During my run the next day, as I attempted to sweat out my disgust, a new thought came ringing through my head: “I did not deserve that. I am worth more.”
The broken record of self-abuse had finally stopped.
Experiences during my time away, both good and bad, convinced me that I was completely worthy of my place at this illustrious institution I had grown to call “home.”  For some, open acknowledgment of the validity of their acceptance could be called arrogance.  For a former anorexic and someone who has continuously struggled with self-destructive insecurity, I call it progress. Humility is vital, but not if it comes at the expense of a sense of self-worth.
Armed with this new balance, I sat down to write the re-re-application essay.
Please understand that going home is not a respite.  Sure, there are fewer all-nighters and it is much easier to sleep on Fridays without “Party Rock Anthem” blaring outside the window. But Harvard students do not set aside everything they have ever worked for in order to relax.  They do so to figure out what is going wrong.
For me, returning to Harvard will be extremely difficult.  There may be mornings when I watch a Lamont sunrise from a third-story window. But I will take an unapologetic swig of mocha and resolutely return to my paper, completely confident in the knowledge that I am more than strong enough—and I have every right—to continue typing.
Students do not go on mental health leave to rest; they leave to return.
Editors’ Note: We made the decision to run this op-ed anonymously due to the private and intensely personal nature of its content. It is our hope that this piece will bring to light issues that affect many members of our community and inform campus-wide conversations on mental health at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force voiced concern at their meeting Monday evening that they are being given too little time to discuss the long-ranging impact of the community benefits package to be included as part of Harvard’s new Institutional Master Plan for Allston development.
The University hopes to file the nine-building plan with the Boston city government in July and receive approval in the fall. Harvard and city officials say that the community benefits section of the plan, which may lay out proposals for services ranging from educational programming to transportation improvements, will be shaped in part by input from task force members.
Gerald Autler, senior project manager at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said on Monday that the task force would have a 60-day period to provide feedback on the master plan. But task force member and Allston resident Bruce E. Houghton railed against Harvard and the BRA for expecting the task force to identify the benefits they want included in the plan in what he described as an unreasonably short period of time.
“What is expected of this community and what’s being placed on it...is inappropriate and impossible,” Houghton said. “What’s truly inappropriate is the fact that there’s an expectation on behalf of BRA that this community should put into place in four months a community benefit package that might last as long as 10 years.”
The meeting had been expected to focus on educational community benefits such as the Harvard Allston Education Portal, which provides mentoring programs, a Harvard faculty speaker series, and other educational services. Houghton, however, requested to bypass the items on the agenda in favor of a meeting-long discussion of the master plan. He argued that although the Ed Portal is a good addition to Allston, a discussion limited to educational programming misses the bigger picture.
“We’re starting from the bottom and trying to figure out a community benefits package, which is going to impact this community for a decade,” Houghton said. “And this is not the way to go about it.”
 
Although task force chair and Allston resident Ray V. Mellone opted not to bypass the agenda, roughly the first 30 minutes of the meeting were devoted to Houghton’s concerns, which were echoed by several other task force members.
 
“These are the questions that are going to define the neighborhood for the next 10 years, and I think it merits some discussion when we’re not being rushed through to hear a presentation by the University or someone else,” task force member and Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said.
 
Autler said he would be open to holding another meeting to discuss the task force members’ concerns. The task force is tentatively scheduled to preview the master plan at its next meeting on July 1.
 
Following the discussion of the master plan, Robert A. Lue, the faculty director of the Ed Portal, gave a presentation that included discussion of HarvardX, Harvard’s branch of the online learning venture edX. Lue, who is also a biology professor of practice, asked for the task force and residents’ thoughts on expanding the role of technology at the Ed Portal. Acknowledging that not all Allston residents know how to use computers, Lue said he hopes the Ed Portal could encourage and teach those residents to “plug in” with its programming.
 
Several residents responded positively to Lue’s ideas. Still, task force member and Allston resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 questioned the feasibility and cost of translating those ideas into practice. For his part, Houghton challenged the relevance of the presentation altogether to the task force’s role in shaping the master plan—something he said that he did not entirely understand.
 
Kairos Shen, chief planner of the BRA, said that the task force’s role in the community benefits conversation is to consider, help prioritize, and provide feedback on potential services. But with the future needs of the community still unclear, Mattison questioned how the task force could prioritize benefits that could be in place years from now.
 
“How on earth can we...say...that bridging the digital divide is more or less important than day care and early childhood education or job re-training?” Mattison said. “We’re not going to try to micromanage knowing eight years from now what the demand for English as a second language is going to be. Because who knows what this community is going to be like in eight years?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Associate Dean of Student Life Kimberly A. Pacelli, the administrator who helped guide the Office of Student Life while it had no head, will leave Harvard on July 19 to become senior associate dean of student affairs at Bowdoin College.
During her nearly year-long tenure at Harvard, Pacelli had a hand in shepherding the College through a series of crises, including a major city power outage, a hurricane, a blizzard, and the Boston Marathon bombings and their aftermath.
 
Pacelli first came to Harvard to assume her post at the Office of Student Life in the fall of 2012. Much of Pacelli’s tenure was marked by the absence of a dean of student life, as the post was vacant from last August, when former interim dean Joshua G. McIntosh left Harvard for Johns Hopkins University, until March, when Stephen Lassonde took over the deanship.
 
In an email Monday announcing Pacelli’s departure to House Masters, resident deans, and college staff, Lassonde and outgoing Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds praised Pacelli for “master[ing] an important and complicated position in the Office of Student Life."
 
As associate dean, Pacelli has advised the House Renewal project, Harvard’s ambitious plan to renovate its upperclassman Houses. She has also served as chair of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Safety Committee and has been involved in the emergency management team for the College.
 
“We're sad to lose her, because she's been such a terrific addition to this office, from what I understand, from the moment she arrived,” Lassonde said in a phone interview Tuesday.
 
Lassonde said he has been told by colleagues that Pacelli transitioned to Harvard especially quickly when she arrived in the fall. He said Pacelli was “pinch-hitting” while working at the OSL with Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich in the absence of a dean of student life.
 
“She really did a great job filling in there,” Lassonde said.
 
Lassonde added that in turn, Pacelli was “critical” to his transition to Harvard after he arrived in the spring from Brown, where he had previously served as its deputy dean of the college.
 
At Bowdoin, her alma mater, Pacelli will join the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs and lead a team of offices for student wellness, she wrote in an email. Prior to coming to Harvard, Pacelli had previously served as the director of residential life at the liberal arts college, which is located in Brunswick, Maine.
 
“Bowdoin is a place that is near to my heart,” Pacelli wrote. “My family and I have strong roots in Maine and we are excited to be returning.”
Reflecting on her time at the College, Pacelli wrote that she would miss “all the wonderful people that make Harvard such a special place.”
 
“I have truly appreciated the opportunity to take a leadership role in supporting Harvard's Houses, which are truly remarkable among college residential systems, and I know that colleagues at Bowdoin are looking forward to learning more about how things work here,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Four Harvard University Police Department officers and a Securitas manager were honored at a ceremony Monday afternoon for their service during the week of the Boston Marathon bombings and the subsequent search for the suspects.
 
HUPD officers Michael Rea, Ryan J. Stanton, Christopher Riccardi, and Peter McGaffigan were recognized for their efforts in Watertown in the early morning of April 19, when a shootout between the two bombings suspects and police wounded Richard H. Donohue Jr., a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police officer. The four officers administered aid to Donohue or offered other support to police at the scene.
 
Brian Reardon, security manager for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for Securitas, was also honored for working long hours with HUPD to keep the campus secure.
“You are such a presence and a force on this campus,” University President Drew G. Faust said in remarks delivered at the ceremony, praising the honorees and the HUPD and Securitas personnel in the audience. “And I think [your] service is evident to us every day. Never more than this spring, but I think what happened this spring is simply a testimony to…the kind of work that undergirds all of our activities in every possible way.”
 
The ceremony, which took place at the Charles Hotel, drew a crowd that included several high-ranking Harvard officials, including Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp and outgoing Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. Daniel P. Linskey, superintendent-in-chief of the Boston Police Department, was also in attendance.
 
“It’s an amazing honor,” Stanton, who was awarded with a medal of valor, said in an interview after the ceremony. “To have the President here, and to be recognized with some of my peers—it’s an amazing gesture by the University.”
 
And although the ceremony on Monday focused on five individuals, both administrators and police officers characterized the honorees’ service as as testimony to the efforts of the Department as a whole.
 
“The recipients of our awards happened to be in the right place at [the] particular time when they were able to take actions that were based upon their commitment to service, training, and character,” HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley said in his remarks. “The recognition they receive today...reflects upon all our dedicated personnel.”
 
For his part, Linskey said in an interview after the ceremony that he was grateful for the support and assistance that HUPD officers provided when crisis hit at the Marathon.
 
“We were hit with a tremendous blow to our city and our country, an evil, on Marathon Monday,” Linskey said. “But the best of our law enforcement partners and our community partners came out, and that included, without me calling, the men and women of the Harvard University Police Department.”
 
Rea, Stanton, and Riccardi were also honored for their efforts by the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden in April.
