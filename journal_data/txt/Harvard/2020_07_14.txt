The question of whether and how to honor flawed historical figures deserves rational and temperate debate. It should not be decided by the insistence of the loudest voices.
Bravo to those who advocate removal of Confederate statues and repellent symbols of racism from the public square. But once we go beyond this, the issue is often more nuanced.
For some figures of old, the matter is easy to resolve. Joseph Stalin was a monster; Jefferson Davis, slavery’s great enabler, has no redeeming value; Joseph McCarthy was a vile demagogue who destroyed reputations and lives.
Likewise, Mussolini “made the trains run on time” (supposedly), but he was a fascist tyrant and war criminal. Philippe Pétain saved France with his great defense of Verdun in World War I but betrayed and dishonored France by embracing the occupying Nazis and abetting the Holocaust in World War II.
Statues honoring any of them are an abomination.
But how should we deal with those whose legacy is mixed? Thomas Jefferson’s support for slavery is unforgivable, but doesn’t he deserve to be honored because he is a seminal figure in the formation of democracy in America and worldwide? Richard Wagner was an outspoken anti-Semite (and a great inspiration to Adolf Hitler), but the Israel Philharmonic has resumed performing his masterpieces. Woodrow Wilson was a racist, but he appointed the first Jewish faculty member to Princeton University, and later the first Jewish member to the Supreme Court.
Other complex historical issues present equally complicated challenges. Lyndon Johnson’s monumental achievements in civil rights and healthcare reverberate to this day, but so does his catastrophic war policy in Vietnam. Should we boycott his important museum in Austin? “God Bless America” is a patriotic triumph that many think should become our national anthem. Should it be banned from public performances, as some have successfully advocated, because Kate Smith, whose recording popularized the song, also made racially offensive recordings?
And what of those whose names have taken on secondary meanings? Cecil Rhodes was a strong force for British imperialism that subjugated millions in the third world. Should we therefore force the proud and distinguished recipients of Rhodes Scholarships to renounce their awards? Alfred Nobel invented dynamite, widely used by the military; it was the first weapon of mass destruction. Should we abolish the Nobel Prizes that he created from the profits of that invention? The Ford Foundation was funded through the fortune of notorious anti-Semite Henry Ford, but it does extraordinary work that benefits humanity. Should we force it to change its name and thereby eradicate its worldwide reputation and relationships?
This is the context in which we must examine Harvard’s current brouhaha about Mather House. Researchers have recently focused on Increase Mather, a 17th century Harvard president, member of the Class of 1656, namesake of Mather House, and a slaveholder. Because of the latter fact, students have launched an effort to divest the House of the Mather name.
Yet while Harvard’s residential Houses are among the jewels of the College and an important part of the undergraduate experience, few people care about their namesakes, former Harvard presidents and benefactors whose lives are shrouded in the mists of time. When I attended Harvard — admittedly ages ago — we were completely oblivious of Increase Mather, much less of his life story. The same was true 25 years later when my daughter attended Harvard and was a resident of Mather House. I suspect the same was true until relatively recently. It is difficult to imagine that anyone was really pained by Mather’s 350-year-old transgressions before they were recently discovered. The contrast with the deeply offensive mall of statues honoring Confederate generals in Richmond, Va. could not be more stark.
The Mather House controversy, then, raises the question of whether it really makes sense to engage in prodigious historical research looking for the sins of those who are so obscure that no one previously knew or cared about them.
Let’s not trivialize what should be a sober case-by-case review of important issues. Let’s not establish retroactive purity tests that few can withstand. Let’s not replicate, for historic figures, the blacklists of 1952 or the witch hunts of 1692.
Princeton got it right when it recently decided to divest the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs of its name. I’m not sure I agree with the decision, but the process — a careful review by a balanced group over a long period of time — was spot on.
We — especially the most educated among us — must examine our past with a clear eye and an open mind, and not engage in pandering or succumb to hysteria.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council circulated a petition on June 15 urging Harvard administrators to build a new multicultural center to house the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.
While student demands for a multicultural center span decades, the recent murder of George Floyd at the hands of police and nationwide protests supporting the Black Lives Matter movement catalyzed the petition, Undergraduate Council President James A. Mathew ’21 said in an interview.
“When you see a situation like this nationally, you think about a microcosm that is on campus, and the way that students need supportive, inclusive spaces — particularly underrepresented students, students of color,” Mathew said.
The UC petition, which currently has roughly 360 signatures, drew upon a report released by the College’s working group on Symbols and Spaces of Engagement in February 2020. “Rethinking the Harvard Foundation,” one of four subcommittees within the working group, listed the transformation of the Foundation’s existing offices among three other recommendations aimed at improving inclusion and belonging on campus.
Professor Ali S. A. Asani ’77, who chaired the subcommittee, said Harvard administrators have been insufficiently “proactive” about foregrounding diversity and inclusion at the College, citing the Foundation’s current location.
“Right now, you can walk by Thayer and you wouldn’t even know that there was the Harvard Foundation in the basement. It’s all hidden,” said Asani. “The spaces where these offices are need to be more prominent, more central. You highlight them, you at least care [about] signage that acknowledges they exist.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment last Friday.

Matthew also said the Foundation’s location in the basement of Thayer Hall fails to reflect its mission statement to “improve relations among racial and ethnic groups within the University.”
“While this is supposed to be this institution on our campus to champion diversity and inclusion, you kind of see symbolically the priority that these issues are getting,” Mathew said. “It's kind of tucked away in a little basement corner that many people don't know about.”
Mathew said that, in past discussions, administrators have been apprehensive about calling the space a “multicultural center,” arguing the name would be “inherently exclusive” and perceived as usable only by a specific part of the student body.
“I think that there's a tendency to treat an initiative like this as very specific to certain communities or only applying to certain students, but in reality, the initiative is predicated on creating better inclusion and as a kind of heightened sense of belonging for all students, and that's, I think, a matter where the entire university is concerned,” Mathew said.
Still, James A. Bedford ’20, a member of another Symbols and Spaces subcommittee, said the petition marks just a “first step” toward building a more inclusive learning environment at the College.
“It needs to be much more than a multicultural center,” Bedford said. “It needs to be rethinking the work of the foundation, rethinking how we think about diversity peer education, how we think about the spaces, about the portraiture in our houses, about the requirements that we have around how people engage with diversity in the classroom both academically in social organizations, or just in day to day life.”
Asani also said Harvard must revise its approach to diversity and inclusion more broadly.
“You know, in light of everything that happened, you've got to think Harvard, and you've got to rethink what the values that Harvard stands for, and if it stands for diversity, inclusion, belonging,” Asani said. “This is what we stand for and these are the programs that we are instituting to enable that to happen. It would send a very loud message not only to the country, but to the world.”
After seeking additional signatures from incoming freshmen, Mathew said he plans to meet with administrators about the petition.
"It really is something that, you know, all students should prioritize. Even if they don’t feel like it's directly affecting them, it’s affecting a friend of theirs,” Mathew said. “I think that’s something that everyone should take really seriously.”
Harvard Foundation Senior Director Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 wrote in an email that he would welcome future collaboration with the Undergraduate Council.
“I'm eager to engage with the UC's leadership as we consider the Foundation's important and ongoing role in the life of our community,” Scarborough wrote. “I will be reviewing our mission and purpose alongside students, staff, and our Faculty Advisory Committee. I'm hopeful that the UC will want to be a part of this process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Harvard College will aim to limit teaching fellow-led sections to 12 students next academic year, the mandatory freshman course Expository Writing 20 will not be subject to that target, according to an internal email obtained by The Crimson.
Expos sections are led by preceptors, rather than graduate student teaching fellows, but several preceptors said their sections should be subject to similar targets in order for them to fulfill their role in supporting freshmen transitioning to college.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators began informing faculty and graduate students in June that sections next academic year should enroll about 12 students. All classes will be held remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, including for freshmen, the only undergraduate cohort invited back to campus this fall.
The expository writing course is usually broken up into sections of up to 15 students, each studying academic writing through the lens of a different subject area. Expos preceptors typically teach two sections.
In the June 23 email to Expos preceptors, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh wrote that because Expos relies on a “carefully-selected and thoroughly-mentored teaching staff,” hiring more students into teaching roles to reduce section sizes, as other departments are doing, would not be “appropriate” for Expos.
“That said, we do expect that fewer first-year students will enroll in the fall, which will reduce section size naturally,” Claybaugh wrote in the email.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement Saturday that the 12-student target applies to teaching fellow-led sections, not “freestanding courses led by faculty.”
“Many faculty, in many departments, will be teaching seminars with more than 12 students in them this fall,” Dane wrote.
Some Expos preceptors said the course will be particularly difficult to run on Zoom.
Expos preceptor Margaret O. Doherty said handling 30 students under normal circumstances is “already a high teaching load, given the kind of teaching that Expos demands of its instructors.”
“We meet one on one with every single student multiple times a semester, we give intense and lengthy feedback on all of their writing,” she said. “Doing it online is going to require even more work and availability and flexibility from Expos preceptors.”
Doherty said the “most frustrating” part of the policy was that the College instituted it without consulting with Expos preceptors.
“I’m really disappointed that we had no say in this decision, as the faculty who do incredibly intensive, incredibly intimate, undergraduate education, and who have a lot of knowledge and expertise about the conditions under which that is best done,” Doherty said.
“All we’ve done is add a huge amount of work and demand, much more time without making any accommodations to make that more feasible for instructors who have their own commitments and families and crises during this pandemic,” she added.
Willa H. Brown, another Expos preceptor, said she and her fellow instructors serve in a unique role as one of the first and closest faculty contacts for freshmen.
“We’re often among the first people who see problems coming up,” Brown said. “As we moved to Zoom, and all of the work becomes sort of more onerous, to me it would make sense that our classes would actually be more heavily or carefully capped.”
Still, Expos preceptors have met frequently to plan how to continue supporting students in the virtual format, Brown said.
“Freshmen spend a lot of time with their preceptors and I think for a lot of freshmen, that’s a useful relationship, and a useful part of transitioning to college,” Brown said. “We like doing it, we’d just like to be able to do our best job possible.”
Brown said she felt the decision reflected a “continuing sense that non-tenure-track faculty just aren’t valued in the same way tenure-line faculty are.”
Both concerns about the status of Harvard’s non-tenure-track faculty and about section sizes existed well before the coronavirus crisis.
Non-tenure-track faculty petitioned Harvard in April to extend appointment caps in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Administrators never responded, and some faculty saw their appointments expire June 30.
In 2014, the graduate student-run Harvard Teaching Campaign led a push to cap all section sizes at 12 students. At least 10 departments endorsed the campaign, which also formed the basis for early organizing in favor of Harvard’s graduate student union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventy percent of Harvard students are at least somewhat likely to enroll for the fall semester, while 15 percent are extremely unlikely to stay on, the Harvard Open Data Project found in a survey published Sunday.
HODP, a student-faculty research collaborative, began surveying undergraduates last week, a day after Harvard released its decision to bring only freshmen and select upperclassmen back to campus for the coming semester and to conduct all classes online. Over a four-day window, the group collected 1766 student responses, representing just above one quarter of the undergraduate student body, including incoming freshmen. The survey was HODP’s most popular project ever, according to the report.
Sahana Srinivasan ’22, who co-authored the study, said she and her colleagues hoped the results would empower students making decisions about whether to enroll this fall by giving them a sense of where their peers stood.
“We've been hearing a lot of people say that what they were doing was contingent on what everyone else was doing,” Srinivasan, a former Crimson News editor, said.
In the months spent anticipating Monday’s announcement about the fall, many undergraduates said they would prefer to take a leave of absence rather than complete a full semester of classes online.
HODP found, however, that the majority of respondents, 74 percent, were at least somewhat likely to enroll for the fall, while a sizable minority, 15 percent of respondents, indicated that they were extremely unlikely to return. However, because their sample had considerably more incoming freshmen than respondents from any other class year, HODP wrote that they re-weighted the responses based on how many students are actually in each class year.
Kevin L. Bi ’21, who co-authored the study, said while he believes the data should be “reasonably representative” of final fall enrollment numbers, he said more students may ultimately enroll than the study indicates.
“I suspect it might be a little bit hard to take time off if people find that alternative opportunities aren't there,” Bi said. “There might be some kind of bandwagon effect where more people realize, ‘Oh, more people than we thought were going back. Maybe we should go back’ or the inverse.”
Sixty-five percent of respondents indicated they would try to find an internship or some type of industry work to fill their time off, the survey reported.
The report found that freshmen — the only cohort guaranteed housing on campus — are significantly more likely to enroll than upperclassmen. Seniors, who Harvard will prioritize for housing in the spring, expressed the next highest level of enthusiasm.
Freshmen and seniors also reported the highest approval ratings of Harvard’s plans for the fall term, averaging approval ratings of 5.85 and 5.08, respectively, out of 10.
HODP reported that most respondents felt Harvard planned to house too few students. Even among those upperclassmen who agreed with the volume of students allowed to return, a sizable number thought Harvard should have chosen a different cohort to live in residence in the fall. Several upperclassmen said the same in interviews with The Crimson, arguing that Harvard should have prioritized seniors so that they can fully benefit from their final year on campus.
Srinivasan said the team found other generative comparisons beyond class year.
International students reported being less likely to enroll, a statistic the HODP team speculated might be related to closed borders and time zone complications.
Hours after Harvard announced Monday morning that all its courses will be virtual, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released an order prohibiting international students enrolled in universities offering only online courses from staying in the United States. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have since challenged the rule in a lawsuit filed in District Court in Boston.
While HODP did not ask survey-takers about the ICE order, many international students told The Crimson last week that the new federal guidelines would jeopardize their ability to remain in or return to the U.S. to continue their studies.
By contrast, Srinivasan said students on financial aid reported being more likely to enroll. Some low-income students have said they would not be able to afford independent accommodations if they took a leave and failed to secure campus housing upon their return.
Though administrators have assured students that Harvard will not alter its leave of absence policies to deter leaves, the College cannot necessarily guarantee students housing when they re-enroll under existing rules.
Srinivasan said that the group is drafting a note to College leaders with the results, and that they hope administrators will use the data to assess how well they are meeting student needs.
But in the end, she said, HODP launched the survey to help students make an informed decision about their own plans.
“I hope this serves as sort of an all-encapsulating answer-snapshot of what people are thinking now,” she said. “We hoped that this would just help students get an answer on that, if they want it to factor into their decision.”
