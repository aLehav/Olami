After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite what the opulent gold inlays in Symphony Hall may suggest, the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) is first and foremost a people’s orchestra. Though acclaimed as one of the most sophisticated and refined ensembles in the United States, the BSO is still is at its best when playing welling crescendos and pregnant fortissimos—their power as electrifying as it is immediately satisfying. As former music director James Levine was able to highlight this strength while also drawing nuanced and controlled playing from the ensemble, the orchestra and the maestro functioned as a single unit, each part anticipating the desires of the other. Though Levine’s absence was noticeable at times, on October 14 the BSO was led by the baton of Spanish conductor Juanjo Mena to reach the ensemble’s highest peaks and its most composed form. Renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 joined them in a performance of Antonín Dvorák’s Cello Concerto in B minor, and he, too, surpassed his international reputation.
The BSO executed the lengthy and dramatic introduction of the concerto perfectly; the double basses in particular propelled the grandiose melody with impressive force. However, throughout the rest of the first movement the BSO was unable to vacate center stage fully and turn it over to Ma. The ensemble was often behind Ma’s beat, despite his efforts at communicating with the ensemble and making sure to look around and make eye contact with first chairs of sections. The orchestra made Ma work much harder than he should have had to as the soloist by often overpowering him in crucial moments when the cello should have been the focus.
This is of course not to say that Ma couldn’t handle the BSO—it just made his command of the hall that much more extraordinary. Though he has performed the concerto many times and recorded an exceptional performance with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1986, he proved himself an ever-growing artist, trading in his memorable light phrasing for a fresh and aesthetically thrilling schizophrenia of emotion. Within the first 24 bars of his entrance, he had showcased styles ranging from tragic to playful, all threaded still with a marked consistency. Ma’s interpretation of Dvorák’s instruction risoluto—“boldly”—avoided the common trap of sounding violent and forced; he declared himself unapologetically and evenly, sitting with broad shoulders and an open chest. His regal bearing allowed for maximally powerful bowing and unity with his instrument.
Ma sustained this kind of energy and artistry for the majority of the concerto and was unaffected by the amount of projecting he had to do over the orchestra—though by the end of the 40-minute piece the double stops on the high notes had notably suffered. He was nevertheless a gracious soloist, turning to the brass section with a satisfied smile to acknowledge their explosive entrance in the second movement and handing the spotlight over to the concertmaster for the violin and cello duet in the third.
The orchestra was indeed in better form after the first movement, their rhythm much tighter and their dynamics much more sensitive. Mena’s decision to leave out the traditional pause between movements added to the bravado of the finale, and special mention must go to the triangle player, who loudly announced the frenzy to follow. Though arguably overdone, the crisp, metallic ring that filled the hall was somehow appropriate, not to mention intensely gratifying. Unfortunately, the phrase leading into the final notes of the concerto left something to be desired: though Dvorák gives it a pianissimo marking, his harmonically strange chords must be played with conviction in order to sound intentional. The ensemble’s tentative introduction to the crescendo gave it a shaky start, but by the final eight bars the BSO was doing what it does best—showing off its fortissimos in full strength.
There was absolutely no trace of the problems that plagued the BSO in the first half of the concert in its performance of Béla Bartók’s Ballet in one act “The Wooden Prince.” The repertoire decision was a wise one: not only is a program of Bartók and Dvorák coherent as both composers rely on folk melodies, but a work like “The Wooden Prince” allows an orchestra to push the limits of its virtuosity—a great piece to let the BSO shine after taking back seat to Yo-Yo Ma’s performance. Mena took the reins and brought out the control in the ensemble—much like Levine did—starting from the subtle first few beats and continuing to push them towards a surprising and wide range of sounds. Each restated theme was different from the previous one in dynamics and phrasing and brought attention to the plot twists of the work. The percussionists—who accented the dance rhythms with their masterful castanets and xylophone and provided the steady backbone for the piece—were partially to credit for this successful variety.
The BSO faces a time of uncertainty with the resignation of James Levine, and some have voiced concerns about the how the lack of leadership will affect the ensemble. This performance is enough to put anyone at ease. Though Yo-Yo Ma was undoubtedly the star of the performance, the synergy between Mena and the ensemble was no less astonishing.

“I am an artist.” These words resound in the viewing room at the Berklee Media Lab, as Jasmine, a shy student from Firgrove Public School in Toronto, finds the courage to admit to her musical prowess. On Wednesday October 12 at 6 p.m., the Berklee Media Lab and the Stan Getz Library presented “Listen to This,” a documentary detailing the progression of three underprivileged students, Jasmine, Donta, and Whitney, through a 16-week music camp. The students worked under the tutelage of pianist Thompson T. Egbo-Egbo—a student at the Berklee College of Music—and music producer Stokes.
The movie takes place in the Jane-Finch area in Toronto, where the students must face the very real difficulties of navigating through a neighborhood fraught with crime and outside distractions, which the students cannot always avert. Erica Charis, an outreach librarian for the Stan Getz library as well as the major organizer for the event, said, “I wanted people to see the film because it’s a well done film, but I also wanted to get a discussion going [about] issues of urban music education.” This theme of the importance of music education in an urban setting was highlighted throughout the night.
Following the documentary was a Q&A session that included Kathleen A. Camara, an associate professor for the Eliot-Pearson Department of Childhood Development at Tufts University, and Egbo-Egbo, who founded Thompson T. Egbo-Egbo Arts Foundation in 2006. Through this organization, he started the Evolving Through the Arts program. This program sets the background for the documentary. Its simple yet powerful goal is to allow children the opportunity to be introduced to music regardless of their socioeconomic background and challenges they may face.
“I’m not trying to create stellar musicians,” says Egbo-Egbo. “I was just trying to create a program that would be important—even if it wasn’t going to build them on the musical side—to their self esteem.” Egbo-Egbo, who was in a similar situation as a child in Toronto, understands the importance of such programs. He took piano classes for two dollars each as a part of the services provided by the Canadian government. Currently, Egbo-Egbo looks to graduate with a major in electrical production design with a minor in acoustics.
Much like Egbo-Egbo’s program, Berklee City Music strives to enrich others through music. A program of underserved youth, Berklee City Music offers music instruction for those in 4th to 12th grade. Although many come with strong musical influences from their respective churches and gospel choirs, the program provides them with a formal education focusing on both theory and performance that includes private lessons. The youth are then assigned to ensembles, where they further their education.
Camara has worked to improve music education through both this program and Youth Beat,  which was founded in 2008. Youth Beat works on researching and evaluating the effects of City Music on development of the 128 children they are currently overseeing in all areas, such as music, academics, and youth leadership.
Reiterating Egbo-Egbo’s sentiment, Camara says, “If you can find a passion that you have and you want to share it with young people and it happens to be a passion they have and something they love to do, I think it makes all the difference in the world in terms of creating a sense of future and identity for these children and youth.”
It is this sense of identity that is seen in the final concert in the documentary. Introverted Jasmine belts out her self-written song and vivacious Whitney sways as she sings one of her own tunes. “If you don’t stand up, when you grow up you’re never going to stand up for yourself,” says Whitney. in the documentary as she talks about her singing. While music may be the basis of these programs, it is the students’ strength and personal growth that ultimately stand out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s National Coming Out Day was particularly memorable on Harvard’s campus not merely as an occasion to “come out” as LGBTQ-identified, but also as a straight ally. Notable among outed allies were members of Harvard’s varsity wrestling team, who stood outside the Malkin Athletic Center sporting “Proud Ally” pins and t-shirts that read “Some Dudes Marry Dudes. Get Over It.” The QSA’s unique approach to Coming Out Day this year empowered all students at the College to express their support for queer-identified individuals, and we applaud the efforts of Harvard’s QSA to lend agency to queer and allied students alike in the global struggle for equality with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity.
To come out as an ally is to uphold the integrity and inalienable rights of queer-identified individuals. In actively affirming their solidarity with LGBTQ students, members of the Harvard wrestling team—among others—signaled not only to members of the Harvard community, but also to the rest of world, that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is unacceptable. This is one of the most potent tactics that we can use to combat discrimination against sexual minorities at home and abroad. The QSA has rightfully noted that coming out as an ally can be just as powerful and meaningful as coming out in the traditional sense.
Let us not forget that just two decades ago, Harvard was not nearly the queer-friendly place that it is today. Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, now director of the Sexuality, Gender, and Human Rights program at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, noted that during his own undergraduate days, the Harvard community stigmatized BGLTQ-identified individuals. And even today, although Harvard, compared to much of the rest of the U.S., is generally a safe and accepting space for queer-identified students, Harvard, too, is often plagued by homophobia. Although we have come a long way since McCarthy’s time as an undergraduate, it is clear that we still have a ways to go. As a recent piece on this page concluded: “it is our duty to speak out against every form of bigotry that we witness,” and we applaud the wrestling team for effectively having done just that.
Though we are generally very supportive of this year’s focus on coming out as an ally, there are nonetheless some notable caveats. Coming out as an ally is, for many, a significant and difficult act, but we are hesitant to equate the act of coming out as an ally with coming out as LGBTQ. Likening coming out as an ally to coming out as LGBTQ may draw an inappropriate comparison for some: Coming out as an ally in a public, fun-loving manner can trivialize and even inadvertently mock what is often, for queer individuals, a very emotional, personal, and traumatic experience. Additionally, it is important to note that coming out as an ally necessarily distinguishes one as non-LGBTQ-identified, and we question the value of such partitions.
Furthermore, although public displays of support for queer-identified individuals are tremendously important in the U.S. as a whole, we should keep in mind that, at places like Harvard, everyone should be considered an ally already. The phrase “coming out” carries the implication that, beforehand, an individual is presumed not to bear the characteristic that he or she “outs,” and we worry that this implication can send the message that being an ally to queer-identified students at Harvard is noteworthy rather than commonplace and praiseworthy rather than expected. This brings to mind the “LGBTQ safe space” demarcations often found on the doors of Harvard proctors and tutors. While we recognize the value of such public declarations, we worry that too many of them might contribute to an understanding that only these spaces are safe. After all, shouldn’t it be understood that our entire campus is a safe space?
Despite some of the thorny questions introduced by the concept of coming out as an ally, this year’s Coming Out Day theme was very much in keeping with the call for acceptance and equality in Harvard and in the world at large. The Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, in organizing a day designed to unite all Harvard students, has truly lived up to its name: if sexual orientation and gender identity should not preclude any individual from the same rights and privileges as any other, then neither should they preclude one from claiming an equal share in the struggle for social justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the time of Harvard’s 375th anniversary—and the tenth anniversary of the successful living-wage campaign on this campus—it seems appropriate to reflect on some more recent history and its meaning for the future of the University.
Back in 2008 and 2009 when the lotus-eaters in the administration awoke to find that all was not well with the endowment, panic ensued. Rather than taking responsibility for this debacle, the administration responded with “the Great Purge.” A decision was reached by handsomely compensated administrators to “downsize” those much lower on the food chain; and for those lucky enough to survive, there were hour cuts and other misfortunes.
Never mind that this was the worst recession in 50 years and that all those who “moved on” would find it rough going in a nonexistent job market. “Prudence” dictated that administrators act boldly, decisively, and swiftly in introducing “efficiency” measures—all within a near-total information blackout.
Of course, “prudence” in investing did not seem to be on the table. As noted in a recent report from the Tellus Institute of Boston, Harvard’s endowment managers were richly rewarded for gambling the lunch money—at the same time that the administration was cutting hot breakfasts for students, shutting down every other elevator at Holyoke Center, and, of course, showing many loyal employees the door.  Here was tragedy and farce in equal measure.
Now a debate has arisen over whether top-level pay packages were fair.  To consider million-dollar compensation as “fair” at the same time that the administration was imposing austerity measures on students, faculty, and employees is simply ludicrous.  Where is the discussion of merit, leadership, responsibility, and accountability?  A few brave souls among the faculty have spoken up—but from the administration, not a word.
Finally, two years later, the administration feels it safe enough to admit publicly that it cut 800 jobs in 2008–2009.  However, because of the total lack of meaningful transparency at an institution whose motto is “Veritas,” one may rationally assume that the number of casualties was much higher than this.
The lack of financial transparency has ballooned as an issue ever since the endowment crisis swept through college communities. Senior administrators at Harvard made sure that the message around endowment losses stayed focused on sacrifice and cuts and not on responsibility.  Their embrace of secrecy resembled nothing less than what was happening in the big banks and financial houses, where the avoidance of responsibility is legendary.
When the scope of the losses became known our union asked for adequate financial disclosure to allay widespread concern that senior administrators were gaming the crisis and pushing an agenda unrelated to need. What we received were the same canned briefings that the rest of the Harvard community—students and faculty—were subjected to.  These “informational” meetings were long on fear and short on facts.
The lack of genuine transparency, and the inability to have a meaningful dialogue about the crisis, convinced us to reject calls for all layoffs and cuts as both unnecessary and needlessly cruel. We said more than once that no one—not managers, not professors, not staff, whether unionized or not—should be pushed out into such a brutal job market.  Unfortunately, senior administrators had no apparent qualms about what would happen to people they laid off, whose hours they cut, or whose wages were frozen.
Harvard’s endowment has surged ahead by 21.4 percent this year, rising to a mere 32 billion dollars.  What better time to jettison the rhetoric of “poor Harvard” and restore those lost jobs and hours cut—and regain some of Harvard’s honor so recklessly spent?  The administration is creating a Harvard that acts not like a taxpayer-supported, nonprofit educational institution, but like a Fortune 500 corporation that cost-shifts its mistakes onto the backs of the vulnerable.
Harvard at its 375th anniversary can—and must—be not only a leader in education, but also a true partner in our larger community and a bedrock of respect and fairness to those who make the University function.

Two things have defined my time at Harvard thus far: The Crimson and my membership in a women’s Greek-letter fraternity, or, as it’s more commonly known, a sorority. I have been a part of both since my freshman year; they have provided a sense of community, a sense of pride, and a feeling of commitment. The difference, I suppose, is that last Sunday, I spent my first evening in my sorority’s new space, which we had worked for years to acquire, while last Friday I was embarrassed to be a Crimson staff writer.
The recent staff editorial, “The Cost of Exclusivity,” signed by the Crimson Staff, is neither representative of sororities at Harvard nor the level of research usually exemplified by The Crimson. I understand that perhaps on the surface, a sorority can seem exclusive, it can seem like an unfair system that further promotes the division of gender on an already divided campus, but what social organization does not come off as such? A sorority celebrates its members, its diversity, and the empowerment of the women who call themselves sisters. The gender division of a sorority is not intended to be an alienating force but rather a tool in which to form a community of women who are strong and driven yet dedicated to the inclusive friendship that comes with pledging.
Every sorority on campus participates in an open recruitment annually, so that any woman, regardless her race, her religion, her background, her socioeconomic status, her interests or her opinions, can have the opportunity to join. Is that exclusive? Unfortunately, although we would love to welcome every woman who participates in recruitment, that is neither practical nor realistic, and any Crimson comp director can attest to that. We select women because they fit the character of our sorority, because they mesh with the other members and because they bring an interesting perspective to our dynamic. Please tell me what is exclusive about a sisterhood that brings girls from nearly every walk of life at Harvard. After all, we have varsity athletes, presidents of organizations, dancers, pre-orientation program leaders, peer advisors, drug and alcohol advisors, senior marshals, club sport captains, tutors, dedicated philanthropy volunteers, the Undergraduate Council Vice President, marathon runners, cancer survivors, service program leaders, artists, innovators, and Crimson writers.
Perhaps if dissenters took a closer—and less biased—look at sororities, they would recognize the impact our chapters have on campus, aside from welcoming over 150 of Harvard’s female students annually. Collectively, we have organized blood drives, basketball tournaments for the blind, trunk shows for charity, and book drives for the underprivileged students of the greater Boston area; we have cleaned up the Charles River, volunteered at the Harvard Homeless Shelter, and, as a larger Greek organization, we raised over $15,000 for Relay for Life, an organization that is dedicated to cancer research and support. Say what you will about Greek life, but these are positive community endeavors that also give us an opportunity to hone leadership skills, which should be celebrated at Harvard rather than attacked.
As for our newly acquired spaces: They were obtained neither in an effort to isolate ourselves from Harvard nor to avoid the rules and regulations that govern our University. We acquired property so that our members could have safe spaces, could have a place to go to be with friends, to be with sisters, and to be with their supporters in a sacred home. This is a place where we can have a movie night with our members, to bake a cake for someone’s birthday, to do school work in a conducive setting, or to watch our favorite show together on TV and marvel that this season is better than the last. It is in our space that we accept one another come hell or high water, and where we leave judgment, competitiveness, and anxieties at the door, a door that has the same kind of key swipe as does The Crimson’s.
For each sorority, leasing a space has been the work of not months, but years. It has taken efforts of countless generations of our membership and untold hours of volunteer work by our local alumnae. Would that much effort have been put in if we wanted a place simply for exclusivity or if there had been a comparable space available for us on campus? Let the collective Greek voice ardently proclaim, “No.”
At its core, a sorority is about sisterhood. The Theta mouth, the DG anchor, and the Kappa handshake may hold no meaning for many, but for us, they symbolize in special ways our sisterhoods. In concert with the virtues of these sisterhoods, we do the very opposite of exclude: We welcome. Our international organizations extend far beyond Harvard, to every corner of North America, but our individual chapters have an impact on Harvard, are felt by the Harvard community, and, if I can speak as one of the members, are intensely appreciated by Harvard students both past and present.
As a three-year veteran of The Crimson, I value the importance of free speech and the right to an opinion, so I will not condemn “The Cost of Exclusivity” on those grounds, but I will condemn the ignorance behind it. After all, in the words of H. Jackson Brown, Jr.: “The greatest ignorance is to reject something you know nothing about.” Next time you see a woman wearing a Greek letterhead sweater, I urge you to ask what her favorite part of sorority membership is, and I know that she will not say its exclusivity, but rather its vibrant and inherently inclusive community.

Perhaps the only aspect of the Arab World’s recent social change more amusing than the passionate debate it inspires is the frequently pathetic attempts by “experts” to explain how one (a clearly very hypothetical “one”) could have seen it all coming. For multiple reasons, “social media”—a euphemism for Facebook and Twitter—is among the most popular chic explanations of our infallible gurus. However, the social media effect is grossly exaggerated. Actually, the greatest technological instigator of social change arrived in the region when Mark Zuckerberg was in elementary school.
Satellite television and its free to air (FTA) satellite channels already include in its ranks over 500 channels serving the Arab World. Over 40 percent of the region’s households have access to them via legal and illegal networks. Market penetration is expected to reach 80 percent by 2016. Furthermore, most restaurants, cafes, and other public places own these meaning that nearly every person in the Arab World likely has some way of viewing hundreds of Arab-produced programs on at least dozens of channels. Al Jazeera and dozens of other large networks have made public debates, investigative journalism, and criticism of governments and politicians mainstream in an astonishingly short period of time.
Al Jazeera arrived first to the scene, in 1993, and it remains the most influential and trusted television network, but the sheer mass of new programming over just the last fifteen years represents a deeper truth. Pluralistic and pervasive dissent is here and it is here to stay.
Of course, the social media story has some merit. Facebook was a useful tool for the youth and elite to organize dissent and civil disobedience. But even within the Arab World, there is not a significant correlation between Internet use or Facebook subscription and democratic movements. Overall Internet use and Facebook subscription remains small as a percentage of the population. Egypt’s 20 million Internet users as of December 2010 may dwarf its 450,000 of 2000, but it is still only a quarter of Egypt’s total population. Greater than 50 percent of Internet users are also Facebook users, with many joining since the start of the Arab Spring. In fact, most Facebook use arose in the last five years. Today, 10 percent of Egyptians use Facebook and statistics from around the region reveal similar figures. These are not insignificant statistics, but the mass movement of the last year could only have arisen from a longer and more entrenched vehicle for agitation.
Furthermore, Internet access is a modern and diminishing issue, but satellite television also transcends a more ancient barrier. Literacy rates are always challenging to quantify since “literacy” itself is relative and difficult to measure. However, according to the CIA, the literacy rates of Egypt and the other North African Arab states are around 70 percent, while the rates in Yemen and Morocco are hardly 50 percent. Like much of the developing world, women are disproportionately illiterate. Illiterate populations undoubtedly gain in incalculable ways from the existence and proliferation of satellite television.
Middle Eastern satellite television may still face draconian internal regulations. Under the guise of “being keen on the sustainable progress of the satellite Arab media” and “services to maintain the Arab identity and the Islamic culture and values[…]” and other anodyne statist canards, the Council of Arab Ministers of Information released the “Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter” in 2008. This Council includes nearly all the members of the Arab League. Most insidiously, the Charter promises to protect “the public right to receive accurate information” and provide “assurance for not jeopardizing social peace, national unity, public order and general propriety.” That is the language of authoritarianism.
There is very little legacy of free media, in any form, in the Middle East. Mass media, both broadcast and print, has from its inception in the Middle East, been predominantly a tool for whichever “-isms” the government was purporting at that time: Nationalism, Pan-Arabism, Islamism, etc. A short 20 years ago, desperately searching for BBC on the radio was the sole opportunity of most Arabs for finding non-government regulated news. The region desperately needed an unregulated medium for information. And years before that medium became cyberspace, it was space.
Satellite television aggravates the status quo by shining a light on the Arab World’s issues and debates, but it cannot on its own literally transform any society. The Arab World’s backwardness is not an Orientalist’s racist fiction. Eighty-eight percent of the population of the Middle East and North  Africa live in states ranked by Freedom House as “not free.” The next closest region is Sub-Saharan Africa where 37 percent of the population live in states ranked “not free.”
Tempering our excitement, we should recall that millions poured onto the streets of Cairo in 1952 and 1977. Revolutions have never required an educated or politically aware populace. The current mass movement likely would have occurred anyway for demographic and economic reasons. However, it would not have been this revolution. The participants of this revolution have far more access to information than their parents and grandparents. Those who prophesied that this information would make the revolution more united or empowered have yet to be proven right. In fact, the greatest surprises of the last year have been the region’s budding political pluralism and its multiple competing visions for the future. We shall see; the best view is in front of a television.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council agreed on Sunday night to offer new funds to student organizations through two initiatives—a loan program which will facilitate student group fundraising, and a renewal of last year’s pilot program of grants for large-scale social events.
Under existing guidelines, the UC does not make grants to help groups run charitable fundraisers or pay certain organizational start-up costs. The rationale for those policies, Leverett Representative Nicholas Oo ’13 explained at Sunday’s UC meeting, is that the money for UC grants comes from term bill charges to students and thus should all be directed toward programs that return benefits strictly to the student body.
The new loans program, which Oo sponsored, will allocate $10,000 from the council’s grants fund to be used for those until-now excluded types of activities, in the form of loans rather than grants—thus holding to UC policy while providing groups with more cash.
During the debate over the legislation, Oo predicted that the UC will recoup all the loans it makes under the new program, even if the student organizations that receive the loans fail to meet their fundraising goals.
“It’s very [likely] for student groups to pay us back, even if they have a loss in their event, because they want to receive grants in the future,” Oo argued, adding that the UC Finance Committee will work closely with grant recipients to supervise their event planning.
The plan passed with 29 council members in favor and one opposed.
The other significant funding-related action of the night promised to award grants to organizations planning social events open to all students in large venues, both on and off campus, during the fall semester.
This program launched on a trial basis last spring, and at Sunday’s UC meeting, council Treasurer Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 recounted its successful uses—including the Rush Hour and All of the Lights parties, both organized by collaborating cultural groups—before proposing that it be renewed this year.
The council also agreed to help publicize two student programs: an upcoming summit run by the organization Students Taking on Poverty, and a campaign which advocates for locally grown and organic produce in Harvard’s dining halls and more student involvement in the College’s discussions about sustainable food.
That publicity may reach a much wider audience than it would have a week ago through one particular channel—Facebook.
UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 mentioned, to much applause, that thanks to the council’s request that students “like” its Facebook page in order to get express access to the free t-shirts it distributed before Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebration, the Council’s page jumped from 650 to 1700 fans last week.

This year’s Harvard Community Football Day, an annual event put on by the University for neighboring residents, saw a number of departures from  its past incarnations.
Saturday’s event—which coincided with Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebrations—garnered over 11,000 RSVPs from Cambridge and Allston-Brighton residents, but drew a relatively modest turnout at the community tent.
While in past years there have been separate community days for Allston-Brighton and Cambridge residents, the University decided this year to merge the separate days into one event for all Harvard community members to foster a sense of unity in honor of the 375th anniversary.
Residents were invited to mingle in the community tent—featuring two round tables, a raffle, party hats, temporary Harvard tattoos, and crayons and coloring pages for children—before watching the football team play Bucknell University.
University President Drew G. Faust made an appearance at the event, stopping by for about 15 minutes to greet residents.
“This is a very upbeat time for us to be neighbors and share a positive community experience with each other,” Faust said. “This is one of the special parts of living in a college community.”
In a departure from previous Allston-Brighton community days, which traditionally served sub sandwiches in the community tent, residents were given vouchers good for one hot dog, one bag of chips, and one beverage from a stadium vendor, a model used during past Cambridge community days.
The University opted for the coupon system in order to accommodate the expected large turnout and allow residents to eat in the stands while watching the football game.
While Cambridge resident Sarah Klein said the event “makes her feel very kindly toward Harvard,” other attendees were not so complimentary.
“The event should go back to the way it used to be. Before, they were more fun, and the food was right here,” said long-time Allston resident Rita M. DiGesse, who said she has been attending community day for years.
She recalled that in previous years, hundreds of people would attend the event.
“Now you’re lucky if you see 50,” she said.
Furthermore, DiGesse added that the group was largely Cambridge residents, noting the absence of an Allston presence among the gaggle of community members mingling in the tent.
However, DiGesse did praise the University for making the event—which was once dominated by adults—more fun for children.
Allston resident Timothy K., who declined to provide his full last name to protect his privacy, came with his two sons—nine-year-old Aiden and thirteen-year-old Liam—both of whom had the opportunity to talk with Faust.
Aiden told Faust that he wanted to go to Harvard, while Liam told the University President that he aspired to become a video game executive.
Saturday’s event marked the third time the family has attended Community Day.
In the past, Timothy recalled, the event “was much better, much more interactive” and featured footballs and a bean bag toss.
Timothy added that he would like to see the University offer more jobs to Allston-Brighton residents and continue to foster a relationship with the community, particularly with “young ones with college in the future.”
The University’s relationship with Allston residents has been rocky in the past few years due to Harvard’s stalled expansion in the neighborhood.
Harvard is now moving forward in planning the development of its property in the area.
Allston resident Linda A. O’Connor acknowledged that the University is trying to improve its relationship with Allston via events like Community Day, but added, “I don’t know how well it’s working.”
Timothy described the community day as “something expected. It’s the least you can do.”
“But,” he added, “we definitely do appreciate this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard professor has reached a settlement with the Cambridge Police Department in a civil federal discrimination suit that alleged he had been wrongfully detained by police after an alleged domestic dispute.
The settlement's size was not disclosed.
S. Allen Counter, a neurologist at the Harvard Medical School and director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, filed a complaint against three employees of the City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department in December 2009. In the suit, Counter claimed that he was the victim of racial discrimination when he was arrested for domestic assault in December 2006.
According to the complaint, Counter was taken into custody after his ex-wife told police that he had attempted to push his daughter, 17, out of a moving car. Counter was then charged with domestic assault but later acquitted when his daughter testified that he had not actually pushed her out of the car.
The complaint that Counter filed alleged that Cambridge police officers had performed unlawful search and seizure by arresting him without probable cause. Counter said that they had not stated the charges against him at the time of his arrest and laughed when he asked why he was being arrested. Counter did not file the suit until three years after the incident.
In January 2010, the defendants—Cambridge Police Officers William Macedo and John Fulkerson, and Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy—filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
In July 2011, Counter’s case was settled and dismissed “with prejudice and without costs, without attorneys fees and waiving all rights of appeal,” according to the document filed with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts.
“We filed this suit because we believe that I, like many other persons of minority background, are victims of police abuse of power and discretion against minorities,” Counter told The Crimson in January 2010.
Counter’s complaint was filed six months after Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. was arrested at his home by Cambridge Police in an incident that garnered national media attention.
Counter told The Crimson last year that the Gates case was a “tragic reflection of the kind of racial profiling and hostility that African-Americans, especially men, face every day.”
Counter told The Crimson then that he and his legal team waited three years to file the discrimination complaint for many reasons, including a fear of police retaliation.
The Cambridge Police Department deferred comment to the City of Cambridge Solicitor’s Office, which did not respond to a request for comment. Counter also did not respond to a request for comment.

Mesmerizing performances by some of figure skating’s greatest athletes delighted fans at An Evening With Champions at the Bright Hockey Center, filling Saturday evening with an assortment of jumps, lifts, spread eagles, and backflips.
1992 Olympic silver medalist Paul S. Wylie ’90 and Olympian Emily A. Hughes ’12 co-hosted and performed in the show, which also featured 2010 U.S. national champion Rachael E. Flatt, Canadian Olympian Shawn Sawyer, and 2010 Olympic champion Yu-na Kim. Kim performed her exhibition piece “Fever,” which showcased her dance moves and gracefulness on the ice.
Every year, the entirely student-run event spotlights premier ice skaters from around the world. In its 41st year, the event has raised over $2.5 million for the Jimmy Fund, the fundraising arm of the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. This year’s show has generated over $100,000, according to a co-chair of the event.
“Our whole, entire goal is to support the Jimmy Fund and to promote pediatric and adult cancer research and treatment,” EWC co-chair Clara Yoon ’12 said.
Other skating legends, like 1994 Olympic champion Oksana S. Baiul, also performed, and two-time Olympic champions Ludmila Y. Belousova and Oleg A. Protopopov, now in their 70s, received a standing ovation from the crowd after performing a beautiful classical piece.
The skaters said they considered it an honor to be invited to this charity event.
“It’s a big event,” 2003 U.S. Collegiate champion Braden Overett said, “and it’s kind of known within skating as a prestigious event to be invited to.”
This event is special not only because of the great performances but also because of the cause. Each year, all the athletes get to tour the Jimmy Fund Clinic and learn about the Dana-Farber Institute.
“It’s such a good charity,” Sawyer said. “The tour that we had explained a lot of the history and what they are going to do with the funds. So, to me, it was really important to know what was going to happen [with the funds]. Boston is really fortunate to have that hospital working with the kids.”

Undaunted by the rain and the pressure of upcoming midterms, throngs of students attended the Office of Career Services Job and Internship Fair on Friday, hoping to connect with potential employers.
This year, OCS decided to separate the job and internship fair from the On-Campus Interview Program fair, which took place in September, in order to provide for the needs of students not involved in the OCI program.
“The division of OCI and non-OCI this year helped to give deserved attention to other employers,” said Deborah A. Carroll, Director of the OCS On-Campus Interview & Employer Relations Office. “It’s a pilot year but it seems to be going really well.”
Kevin J. Chin ’13, who attended both the OCI fair and Friday’s fair, said that last week’s event was “more personal.”
“It’s nice to have more breathing room,” he said.
Both attendees and organizers noted the diverse range of employers present at the fair, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to advertising firm Digitas and biotech firm AmniSure International.
“There’s a broader scope of employers than I had anticipated,” said fair attendee Ramon L. Perez, a student at the Harvard Extension School.  “I’ve spoken to a lot of really interesting people.”
Carroll noted that she was particularly excited to have Levi Strauss for the first time, in addition to other fashion industry representatives, including Gilt Groupe.
Fair attendee Emelyn A. Rude ’12 said that seniors are feeling pressure to find a job before graduation, and that the fair format—while helpful—can present some difficulties.
“It’s a hard environment to connect in,” Rude said.
Alison Gruber, representing sales and marketing consulting firm ZS Associates, said that while the event started slowly, it later picked up.
“There has been a very good turnout,” she said. “I’m surprised by how busy it’s been, especially with the rain.”
Gruber added that she was also surprised by the range of ages represented by event attendees, saying she had spoken to freshmen, graduate students, and people as old as her grandfather.
“Students were engaged and ready and interested,” Carroll said. “It’s a tough economy. Harvard students are resilient.”

Dennis M. Ritchie ’63, a Harvard graduate who had a profound impact on modern technology, died last week at 70.
Ritchie was the principal designer of the C programming language and co-inventor of the operating system Unix, two inventions that revolutionized modern technology.
The C programming language was widely considered simple and elegant compared to the more cryptic and inaccessible B language that preceded it, and is now widely used. Based on C, Ritchie and Kenneth L. Thompson invented Unix, which is the foundation of today’s predominant operating systems.
Ritchie worked for Bell Laboratories for his entire career.
At Bell, Ritchie met Brian Kerninghan, who became a friend and colleague of 40 years. The two co-authored “The C Programming Language,” a 274-page explanatory book that has been widely translated and sold millions of copies.
“The programming language is the best combination of elegance, expressiveness and efficiency the world has seen. It is hard to overstate the importance of C—any computer or communications system uses C directly or through one of its descendents,” Kerninghan wrote in a letter to USENIX, The Advanced Computing Systems Association.
Ritchie and Thompson received three major awards for their development of Unix. In 1983, the Association for Computing Machinery awarded them the Turning Award. In 1993, President Bill Clinton awarded them the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. And this year, they received the Japan Prize in Information and Communications—which Professor of Physics and of Electrical Engineering Paul Horowitz ’65 called “the Nobel prize of computer science.”
Horowitz, who knew Ritchie from his high school and college years, said that Ritchie and his roommates in Leverett House were “nerdy” but serious about what they did.
“He made a dent in the fabric of computer science,” Horowitz said of Ritchie.
Harvard Professor of Computer Science Harry Lewis blogged about Ritchie’s important contributions.
“Ritchie bears more personal responsibility than anyone else for C and Unix, and hence for their many derivatives. The world would be a VERY different place had he not created these things,” Lewis wrote.
As an undergraduate at Harvard, Ritchie concentrated in Physics. He went on to earn a graduate degree in Applied Mathematics at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Professor of Computer Science Margo L. Seltzer met Ritchie when she was a graduate student.
“It didn’t matter if you were a graduate student or a Nobel Laureate—your thoughts, questions, and opinions mattered just as much as anyone else’s,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson. “From my perspective, Dennis hated being the limelight—he always preferred being treated as ‘just another conference attendee’ and wanted to hang out in the hallway and take part in whatever conversation was going on—it didn’t have to even be about computers.”
“Dennis changed the world and we are all indebted to him,” Kerninghan wrote to USENIX.
Ritchie will be remembered for his quiet, gentle demeanor, Seltzer said.
“He was a wonderful human being—not just a brilliant creator and engineer, but a kind, friendly, witty person,” she said.

Members of the Boston Bruins accepted the “Best Sports Team Ever” award in front of a crowd of approximately 400 Cambridge residents and students on Sunday afternoon.
Beginning in the early afternoon with live music performances, the event culminated in a ceremony in Brattle Square following a parade down Mass. Ave.
“It was a great time,” Bruins center Brad Marchand said. “It was very light-hearted, but everyone really enjoyed it and it was really funny. I was not expecting that.”
His low expectations were appropriate, given that the award was presented by the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
But amid the ceremony honoring the championship team, a more triumphant victory was scored outside a bus holding a motley crew of chattering ‘Poonsters and The Crimson’s President’s Chair.
A team of Crimson editors were on hand as the bus parked near the ceremony. As the ‘Poonsters disembarked, Crimson editors surrounded the vehicle, eventually gaining access to the bus and liberating the chair.
Lampoon President Charles A. Sull ’12 declined to comment for this article on Sunday evening.
As a page turned in the history of Crimson-Lampoon rivalries, festivities were underway in Brattle Square.
Local music groups performed in the square, and vendors, such as Boloco and Bertucci’s, sold food and drinks to the growing crowd.
The Bruins, who won the Stanley Cup last June for the first time since 1972, arrived to Cambridge at around 3:15 p.m.
The players—Johnny Boychuk, Andrew Ference, Milan Lucic, Shawn Thornton, Tyler Seguin, and Marchand—greeted fans before entering the Lampoon Castle, where they continued to sign autographs for young fans.
At 4 p.m., the players departed the castle in Super Duck tour buses and began a parade along Mass. Ave. and Brattle Street, culminating in Brattle Square.
The players, joined by members of the Lampoon, took the stage along with the Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher. Maher, who referred to the Bruins as the “Cambridge Bruins,” told the crowd that he had proclaimed Oct. 16 as Boston Bruins Day in Cambridge.
Sull followed Maher, telling the crowd that the Bruins had beat out competition from sports teams from every era to earn the award, represented by a six-foot tall, multi-tiered trophy.
But before the Bruins could claim the award for themselves, the players had to defeat a squad of Lampoon members, deemed the Lampoon Indians, in a game of dodgeball. The Bruins dominated the encounter, giving the Lampoon their second defeat of the day, although several bystanders were struck by errant throws from both sides.
“I was a little nervous going into the dodgeball match, but we pulled through,” Marchand said. “We’re just happy to have that wicked trophy.”
After receiving the trophy, each player took the microphone and performed short comedy sketches for the hundreds of delighted fans. The skits, written by Lampoon writers, harped on stereotypes of hockey players and characteristics of the team’s big names.
For example, Seguin, a 19-year old center, gave a fake retirement speech and stated his plans to enroll in Harvard College full-time as a freshman. Wearing a crimson T-shirt with “Actual Harvard Student” written on the front, Seguin made several jokes aimed at the men’s hockey team, stating he is excited to play in arena “that provides free popcorn to all nine fans.”
“I guess we’re up there [among the best teams of all time],” said a smiling Lucic, the Bruins’ leading scorer last season. “To be honored like this ... is great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heralded by a live rendition of the theme from Family Guy, Seth W. MacFarlane, the show’s creator, took a swig of what appeared to be alcohol in front of a packed audience at Memorial Church this Saturday.
“This is kind of hilarious doing this in a church. [I’ll just] take communion here,” said MacFarlane, who was accepting the fifth-annual Harvard Humanist of the Year Award.
His speech, which delivered religious punch line after punch line, addressed what he described as the corrupting influence of religion in today’s society. His address supported Humanism as an alternative to traditional religion.
Humanism is another choice from “the [faiths] that make such a difference in people’s lives,” according to Greg M.  Epstein, Harvard’s Humanist Chaplain.
“2011 is a strange time to be a humanist,” MacFarlane said. “The knowledge that we have today, you will not be able to find these things in the Bible. At the same time, our society clings to these bizarre [Biblical] superstitions.”
Underlying MacFarlane’s argument was the notion that religion is no longer necessary to keep society intact. Instead, he said, people should turn to reason and science to uphold moral values.
“There are religious folks who acknowledge science, [but] the rest live by what believers call ‘blind faith,’” said MacFarlane. “What these believers are demanding is more like Helen Keller faith. If you don’t understand your world, you just moan and throw shit at it.”
In the event’s question and answer period, MacFarlane acknowledged that Humanists can do good working alongside the faithful, citing environmental conservation as a goal that both groups could work towards. Still, he argued that reason should ultimately prevail over religion.
“I don’t see anything wrong with that,” he said of collaborating with the religious. “We aligned with the Russians during World War II and then we went after them. Let’s do that.”
In one of the more awkwardly received moments of the evening, MacFarlane acknowledged the interpreter translating his speech into sign language.
“Are you doing sign language?” he asked, to no response. “So no jokes about anal sex. Certainly no jokes about performing fellatio.”
The interpreter did not respond.
“Sodomy!” he said, turning to the interpreter at random point later in the evening.
MacFarlane also made jest of the church’s decor, describing the bird adorning the speaker’s podium as a “Hitler eagle.”
MacFarlane said he recognized that his jokes were intended to offend, but described himself as an “equal opportunity offender.”
The award was sponsored by the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy.
The humanist community at Harvard and around the world is rapidly expanding, according to Esptein. The Humanist Chaplaincy now hosts typically religious ceremonies, including weddings and funerals.
The Harvard Secular Society, an undergraduate organization that aligns itself with Humanism, consistently draws a group of about 30 people, according to its president Jimmy P. Bohnslav ’13.
“We are an organization that takes common sense’s ideas ... to figure out how to relate to one another,” said Epstein.

Surrounded by a boggy swamp of brown mud, performers slipped on the dance floor as a heavy downpour soaked the festive pandemonium of Harvard’s 375th Anniversary Celebration Friday night.
Months of planning culminated in the University-wide celebration in Tercentenary Theater, highlighted by a solo performance of “Happy Birthday” by renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 as University President Drew G. Faust sang along. Colored lights glittered on the Widener Library steps as guests feasted upon a red velvet cake serving 5,000 and danced in the rain to live music by the Jimmy Vali band.
But some say that despite the celebrations, the heavy rain sent them scurrying for dry land, with a few adding that the University seemed unprepared for the downpour.
In an email over the Leverett House open list, House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 apologized for the weather and that “[his] colleagues in the administration organized it so badly.”
Some noted that the University’s rain contingency plans seemed limited, as attendees crowded under the awnings of the few tents serving ice cream, chocolate desserts, and freshly-pressed hot apple cider. With water streaming down musical instruments, Ma’s performance was moved from his solo platform to the main stage.
“I think they should have thought this through a little better,” said Manuel A. Melendez Sanchez ’15, who abandoned the festivities to have a drier meal in Harvard Square.
But for some students and alumni, the deluge only added to the festivities.
“The rain has put everyone on party overdrive,” said Diane L. Bear, the wife of John L. Hamilton ’66.
Individual House dinners kicked off the evening, with cuisine carefully selected to represent Harvard’s culinary history, and were followed by grand House processions through the rain.
House spirit rivaled that of Housing Day as Pforzheimer House processed behind a giant lit polar bear, Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin were carried in on a rickshaw, and Quincy House celebrated with flashing shot glasses which they termed “candlesticks.”
“We managed to get through the currents of water and we’re still full-House strong,” Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley said as he strode in front of the Kirkland float.
As undergraduates proceeded to gaze at the intricate ice sculptures and eat ice cream made from vats of steaming liquid nitrogen, graduate school students marched through to demonstrate their own spirit.
Harvard Kennedy School students, decked out in clothing from around the world, chanted “Ask what you can do,” a reference to former President John F. Kennedy ’40. Glowing LED shields sewn on shirts displayed the crest of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, while Graduate School of Design students sported architectural headdresses.
Many noted that the event brought together the entire University, an occurrence rarely seen outside of Commencement ceremonies.
“It’s nice to see a lot of school unity,” Katharine D. D’Orazio ’15 said. “Freshmen usually don’t get to see this many upperclassmen.”
Despite the downpour, some alumni praised the event as much more energetic and enjoyable than previous anniversary celebrations, due to the University’s efforts to cater to current students in addition to an older alumni audience.
“This 375 is incredible,” said David Kenney ’73, father of College sophomore Alice A. Kenney, who added that his grandfather Laurence Chenoweth, Class of 1911, was present for Harvard’s 300th Anniversary. “I like the fact that all the undergraduates and graduates are involved and very excited about it.”
Deputy Chief of the Harvard University Police Department Michael D. Giacoppo and HUPD Sergeant Richard W. Mederos recalled Harvard’s 350th Anniversary Celebration—which included a daytime keynote address by Prince Charles of Britain and a firework extravaganza—and said that this year’s celebration was more lively and fun.
“Harvard actually threw a great party,” said Aneliese K. Palmer ’12.

Despite losing twice two weekends ago, Harvard’s field hockey team came back Saturday and defended its goal—both literally and figuratively—as it beat Cornell, 3-1, to advance into a five-way tie for first place in the Ivy standings.
The Crimson (7-5, 3-1 Ivy) boasted a balanced attack throughout the match, relying on tallies by three different players. And although Harvard was out-shot by the Big Red (5-7, 0-4), 17-12, the Crimson was able to snatch its third consecutive Ivy win in Ithaca, N.Y.
Freshman Sydney Jenkins paced the Crimson offense with a goal and an assist, while co-captain Georgia McGillivray and freshman Noel Painter rounded out the scoring.
“I thought it was a really solid game,” said Painter, whose second-half score gave her a team-leading five goals on the season. “Cornell is a very tough opponent. It was definitely a physical game, but I thought that our play in the second half really showed that we are a better team, and we came out on top.”
Junior Kim Goh agreed with Painter, though she noted that the team’s pacing was slightly off.
“I think it went really well,” Goh said. “We got the result we wanted, which was really exciting, especially since right now we’re still contending for the Ivy title. But the game felt a bit rushed, and I don’t think we ever really found our flow. At the end of it, though, we were able to come out with the win.”
The game began with a slew of shots coming from the Big Red, but neither team found the back of the cage until the 33:04 mark, when McGillivray capitalized on a penalty stroke.
Holding a 1-0 lead going into the half, the Crimson set the pace for the rest of the game.
The penalty stroke did not come without a price though. On the previous play, freshman Paige Haley became tangled up with the defense, which ultimately led to a costly injury.
“[Co-captain Carly Dickson] snapped the ball up, and [Haley] was behind all the defenders,” Goh explained. “The goalie actually took her out. We’re pending diagnosis of a concussion right now, so she really took one for the team.”
The lead was short lived though, as a scramble near the start of the second half resulted in a Cornell goal, tying the game at one goal apiece.
The score came after junior goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos blocked a shot from the Big Red’s Genevieve Collins, who recovered the ball.
Collins sent it straight to teammate Katherine Stone, who took advantage of the crowd in front of the goal and knocked the ball into the net.
But Harvard was not to be deterred, and with 15 minutes left in the contest, it took the lead for good. After a quick pass from Dickson, Jenkins cleared the shot into the net.
“In the second half, we created a lot more corners and really shifted the momentum,” Painter said. “The second goal from the oppositional corner [by Jenkins] was really the point of the momentum shift, and after that we just kept going.”
That they did, as Painter herself soon added to the Crimson’s total. After a missed shot by Cornell and a series of fouls, McGillivray advanced the ball from the backfield to Jenkins at midfield. From there, it took a backdoor pass to Painter to put the game away.
“I caught it behind one of the defenders,” Painter said. “It was a beautiful pass. I got it, went one-on-one with the goalie, and could just finish it off.”
Tassopoulos continued to dominate in the net, saving seven shots and allowing only one goal. Before Saturday’s match, Tassopoulos was ranked ninth in the nation with a .794 save average.
With Saturday’s victory, Harvard is now on a three-game winning streak within the Ivy League, furthering the Crimson’s hopes of taking home its first Ivy League title since 2004.
“As a team, we’re just concentrating on improving,” Painter said. “Our coach always says, ‘Get one percent better every single practice,’ and that’s what we’ve been doing. We evaluate what we’ve done, what we’ve done well, and what we need to work on for the big games ahead.”

After being dropped by Cornell (3-15, 1-5 Ivy) Friday night, the Crimson women’s volleyball team (10-7, 3-4) regrouped to handily defeat Columbia (11-6, 5-2) Saturday evening in straight sets.
“After losing to Cornell, we talked about it a lot and ... everyone on our team thought overnight about what we had to do to change,” co-captain libero Christine Wu said. “I think we just really showed up [against Columbia], and we had everyone’s presence on the court ... Everyone did their job.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
After taking a beating the night before against Cornell, Harvard proved to be a different team Saturday, dropping the Lions in three games, 25-23, 25-21, 25-23.
“Today everyone came ready to play and ready to fight as a team,” said co-captain middle blocker Sandra Lynne Fryhofer. “I think we had really good chemistry.”
The Crimson received contributions from all over the court against the Lions, which had entered the match in a tie for first place in the Ivy League.
Up front, freshman Kristen Casey logged 10 kills. Fryhofer added nine, and sophomore middle blocker Teresa Skelly and junior Taylor Docter claimed eight apiece.
“Our hitters did a really good job of finding open court and moving the ball around, and not just hitting to one side of the court,” Fryhofer said. “They saw the court really well.”
Strong serves also propelled the Crimson to victory, with Docter hitting five aces in the decision.
“We had some amazing serving [against Columbia],” Fryhofer said. “We were super aggressive serving on them, so they were kind of out of system, which was an advantage for us.”
The Crimson defense also had a solid performance on Saturday.
“We had some great blocking,” Fryhofer said. “Skelly and [sophomore] Erin Cooney ... were always up four hands every time.”
In all three sets, Harvard went back and forth with Columbia, winning by at most four points in a single set. But unlike in the previous night’s game, Harvard was able to sustain its winning momentum.
Columbia kept up with Harvard in the opening set, with the teams tying at 17-17, 19-19, and 21-21. But the Crimson pulled away when Doctor mustered up a powerful kill after a Harvard time-out­—adding to her 200 total kills, 90 of which have been in Ivy play—deciding the match for Harvard, 25-23.
In the second set, Columbia and Harvard again began neck and neck, tying at 9-9 and again at 17-17, but the Crimson would jump out on a 7-0 run to best the Lions, 24-17. Columbia got a chance to come back after a Harvard missed-serve brought the score to 24-18, but the Crimson’s lead proved too great, and Harvard toppled the Lions, 25-21.
Docter began the third and final set of the night with an ace, setting the tone immediately. After an opening 4-0 run by Harvard, a disjointed Columbia team called a time-out. The Lions were able to regroup and give the Crimson a scare, tying things up at 16-all and 23-all. But the Crimson responded under pressure and sealed the deal with a 25-23 victory in the set.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard started its weekend with a bang, crushing Cornell, 25-12, in the first set of the night on Friday. But as the night progressed, the squad’s initial fire fizzled. The Big Red took the next three sets on its way to a 3-1 victory over the Crimson for its first Ivy win of the season.
“We came out firing in the first game then we got complacent,” Wu said. “We kind of sat back and let them play at us.”
In the opening frame, the Crimson came out as a force, recording several match-highs. Docter logged a game-best five blocks and 14 kills, and Casey’s 17 digs and nine kills came just short of earning her a double-double. Fryhofer had a match-best eight blocks, and Cooney had six blocks and eight kills.
After taking the first set with ease, Harvard’s game dramatically declined as Cornell rose to the occasion.
“They played lights out,” Wu said. “They were just firing balls, and we didn’t really respond and didn’t stick with our strategy and play Harvard volleyball.”
The Crimson opened with a .215 hitting percentage, but it progressively dwindled to a mere .065 by the fourth and final set. While Harvard was on a decline, the Big Red was on the up and up, bettering its hitting percentage from .119 to .308, while taking the last three sets, 25-18, 25-17, 25-18, and holding Harvard to fewer than 20 points in each set.
“They just kind of broke us down,” Wu said. “It wasn’t our best performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a night of frustration for the Crimson men’s soccer team, who fell to Brown (7-4-1, 2-1 Ivy), 1-0, in a defensive battle Saturday evening at Soliders Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium. The Bears handed Harvard (2-9-1, 0-3) its fifth consecutive loss, a streak that includes the squad’s first three Ivy League contests.
The game’s lone goal was put away by senior midfielder Evan Coleman and assisted by classmate T.J. Popolizio. In the 31st minute, Popolizio delivered a pass into the top of the box that the Crimson defense couldn’t clear cleanly. Coleman gained possession before poking it into the left side of the net.
“Brown gave us a really tough game, and I thought everyone on our team came to play today,” sophomore defender Kevin Harrington said. “Unfortunately, it just came down to who could finish their chances.”
Brown outshot Harvard, 6-5, in the first half, but neither team was prolific on offense.
The Crimson struggled to find opportunities in the early going. Its best scoring chance of the first period came on a 20th-minute ground cross delivered by sophomore defender Ross Friedman. The pass connected with sophomore forward Connor McCarthy, but his shot from close range was blocked by a defender.
The Bears only managed one other shot on goal in the game, a strike from junior defender Dylan Remick that was easily corralled by junior goalkeeper Bret Conrad.
The home side came out with superior play in the second half but was unable to find an equalizer.
Freshman forward Michael Innocenzi was turned away on a 53rd-minute strike from the top of the box by junior goalkeeper Sam Kernan-Schloss.
A minute later, freshman midfielder Tim Schmoll delivered a dangerous cross deep in the box. Schmoll went down battling for the ball in front of the net, but no was foul was given.
Harvard dominated possession for the rest of the game but couldn’t produce a goal. Repeated crosses and serves into the box failed to generate frequent scoring opportunities.
“I think we competed and controlled a lot of the play,” sophomore defender Ross Friedman said. “We just didn’t create enough offensively.”
The Bears were relatively quiet on offense in the second half, failing to put a shot on goal.
The Crimson turned up the heat in the final minutes, pushing men forward. But its last-ditch efforts came up short, as the Brown defense held strong and brushed away each Harvard attempt. As the final seconds ticked off the game clock, a Brown clearance rolled down the sideline capping off what was a difficult night for Harvard.
The match was characterized by its physicality, as the two teams combined for 27 fouls and a yellow card.
In what turned out to be a defensive struggle, the Crimson’s back line was anchored by strong play from Harrington, Friedman, fellow sophomore defender Pascal Mensah, and co-captain Tim Linden. The Bears only managed seven shots in the contest to Harvard’s nine.
But an inability to score goals continues to plague the Crimson offense. The home side certainly had the better of play in the second half, as it often showed promising build-up play, but Harvard still couldn’t find a way to create chances in front of the net and add the finishing touch to score.
“You need to give Brown credit for keeping us out of their net for 90 minutes,” Harrington said. “But we’ve got to keep working on offense and getting more goals because that’s been a problem for us all year.”
With the win, Brown moves into a tie for second place in the Ivy League standings, trailing only Cornell. At 0-3, the Crimson’s hope for an Ivy League title will continue to slip away without a quick turnaround.
One bright spot on the night was the halftime presentation of an honorific No. 5 jersey to former Harvard standout Will Kohler ’97, an All-American who won the 1996 Ivy League Player of the Year award among other accolades.
The Crimson is off for the week and will play Princeton at home on Saturday night. Harvard plans to use the time to rest and prepare, hoping to reverse its recent offensive woes.
“We know we’re a better team than this,” Friedman said. “We’ve just got to keep battling and hope that the results start to show that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago against Lafayette, the Harvard defense carried the team, strangling the Leopard attack to give the Crimson the easy 31-3 win.
Last week against Cornell, it was the offense’s turn to take the wheel, and Colton Chapple and Co. willed Harvard to a 41-31 victory in an ugly defensive game for both squads.
This week, the offense and defense must have forgotten to coordinate, because both sides of the ball dominated all day long—or, more precisely, for 35 minutes, after which the second- and third-stringers hit the field. Harvard didn’t need much time on Saturday to build an unassailable lead.
The latest contest featured the most dominant Crimson performance of the year. In its mid-season tune-up—the last non-conference game of the year—Harvard looked pretty tuned-up.
Junior quarterback Colton Chapple again led the offense on a scoring tear and once more stomped all over the record books. Harvard football’s been around for a while, and only one other time has a quarterback thrown for five touchdowns in a single game. But it took Chapple only a bit more than two quarters to get there. And never before has a Harvard quarterback thrown four touchdowns in two consecutive games.
Chapple fired his five touchdown passes on Saturday with pinpoint accuracy. You couldn’t have placed them any better. The throws fell just out of the defenders’ reach and into the hands of Chapple’s receivers.
Bucknell never got close to intercepting one, but then again, not many teams have. In his three full games behind center, Chapple has 12 touchdown passes under his belt and only two picks.
Keith Wright—the co-captain of the Harvard men’s basketball team—may have said it best in a tweet: “Colton is picking this defense apart in the red zone. If we had scholarships he would definitely be earning his right now.”
The biggest development on the Chapple front—other than his shockingly rapid ascension to the top of the depth chart, replacing the injured incumbent—is that he evolved into a dual threat on Saturday. When the junior couldn’t find the open receiver, he tucked the ball and took off down the field. Sure, the guy’s not going to set any land speed records, but he clearly knows when and where to run. And that’s as important as anything. In total, Chapple’s 71 rushing yards led the team.
But it’s not fair to give the newly-anointed King of the Harvard Offense all the credit for his second consecutive record-breaking day. He knows that, and in the press conference he acknowledged the talented offensive line and wide receiver corps.
But Chapple forgot the guys who were most important in padding his statistics on Saturday: the defense.
In the team’s five touchdown drives, Harvard had to travel 40 yards or less three times. Only once did Chapple have to lead the team 60+ yards for the score. And that was all thanks to the mighty Harvard defense, which was in rare form on Saturday.
Against the vaunted Crimson defensive line—which coach after coach labels as the best they’ve seen in a while—Bucknell had negative-five rushing yards on the day. In addition to five sacks, including one by senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz, who is still right on pace for 10 sacks this year, the Harvard D-line harassed Bucknell QB Brandon Wesley all game, hurrying and drilling him relentlessly. In this one, the Crimson defenders were the bulls, and Wesley wasn’t the matador—he was the red flag.
Once again, I can’t put it any better than Wright did in another tweet: “bucknells [sic] QB is getting abused out there. I guess they don’t believe in protecting the passer like us. #bucknell problems.”
And the Harvard secondary, which last week struggled against mighty Cornell gunslinger Jeff Mathews, regained its rhythm again. In the first half, when all of the starters were still on the field, the back seven held the Bison passing attack to a grand total of 36 yards.
The Crimson also had four interceptions on the day, one of which proved to be one of the highlights of the afternoon. Early in the second quarter, junior cornerback Brian Owusu stepped in the way of an underthrown Bucknell pass deep in Harvard territory, ending a Bison drive that could have evened the score at 7-7.
Owusu’s interception and his ensuing return set up a Crimson score and gave Harvard a 14-point lead early in the second quarter. And it would never get any closer.
Bison coach Joe Susan pointed to Owusu’s play as the turning point in the game, as the momentum changer. But in a game where Bucknell was the fat kid and Harvard the bully, a turning point was inevitable. Harvard was just the better team.
So what does all of this mean, especially now as the Crimson turns its focus to Ivy League contests from here on out?
Well, at least in my mind, after a couple of poor Yale performances and Penn barely escaping middling Ivy teams two weeks in a row, Harvard has quietly become the favorite to take home the Ancient Eight crown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It appears as if Harvard senior quarterback Collier Winters may have been “Wally Pipped.”
After going down with a hamstring injury against Holy Cross during the first week of the season, Winters—like Pipp, the former Yankees starting first baseman—was replaced for the Crimson’s Week 2 game against Brown by junior Colton Chapple.
But with Winters now healthy again, Chapple—much like Pipp’s injury replacement, Lou Gehrig—doesn’t appear interested in giving Winters his job back anytime soon.
The Georgia native has not only held down the fort while filling in for Winters; he has shined.
After Chapple threw for 414 yards—the second-highest single-game total in Harvard history—last week against Cornell, Crimson coach Tim Murphy decided to stick with the junior under center against Bucknell. It was a decision that paid off big time, as Chapple picked apart the Bison defense with ease Saturday afternoon, both in the air and on the ground.
And though he may not play in 2,130 consecutive games as Gehrig did, the junior has nonetheless made a definitive statement that he is the best man to lead Harvard moving forward.
The quarterback scampered for a team-leading 71 yards, using his legs to keep drives alive time and time again. Fifty-three of those yards came on a mid-first-quarter drive, when Chapple scrambled for 10 yards on 3rd-and-7 and then 14 yards on 3rd-and-8 to pick up key first downs.
“Colton’s just playing really smart, focused, disciplined football,” Murphy said. “He knows when to put it up, and he knows when to tuck it ... more than anything, he’s making good decisions.”
Chapple was extremely effective throwing the ball as well. After losing a fumble on the Crimson’s opening drive of the second quarter, Chapple atoned for his error on Harvard’s next possession. The quarterback rolled right and hit a leaping senior wideout Alex Sarkisian with a perfectly-placed 27-yard touchdown pass, giving the Crimson the 14-0 lead.
The junior never looked back, equaling Carroll Lowenstein’s 1953 five-touchdown Harvard passing record—set during a Halloween contest against Davidson. Chapple also became the first Crimson passer to ever throw four touchdowns in back-to-back games. And he did so in just a little over a half, after which sophomore Michael Pruneau entered with the Crimson up, 35-0. The junior has now thrown 12 touchdowns with just two interceptions in four games this year.
IT’S TOO TIGHT
Murphy has used a heavy two tight-end offense for much of the season, and Chapple has made the dynamic pair—junior Kyle “Juice” Juszczyk and sophomore Cameron Brate—the centerpieces of the Crimson passing attack.
Each caught two touchdowns on the afternoon. Juszczyk started the scoring by hauling in a Chapple pass over the middle on the last play of the first quarter.
Brate put the Crimson up, 21-0, 10:21 into the second, snagging a nine-yard touch pass from Chapple with a defender on his back in the right corner of the end zone. The sophomore added a four-yard score with just 26 seconds left in the half, and Juszczyk matched him under two minutes into the third period by snagging Chapple’s fifth TD of the game. On that play, the junior made a nifty move to get around his defender over the middle and snagged the ball in stride for a 25-yard score.
“We’d been setting up that play the entire day,” Juszczyk said. “All that route was was a slant-and-go. The safety bit right away as soon as I made my slant cut, and I just went over the top.”
Brate and Juszczyk are now first and third on the squad, respectively, with 269 and 213 yards receiving on the year.
“[They provide] a tough matchup for a lot of safeties and linebackers,” Murphy said. “We’re getting a lot of good looks to Cam and Juice.”
D-OMINANT
Though Chapple shined and the offense put up 42 points, it was truly the defense that set the tone in the Crimson win.
On the afternoon, Harvard forced five turnovers, had eight tackles for loss, gave up just 140 total yards (minus five on the ground), and allowed only five Bison first downs. Three of those came in the fourth quarter, when the backups were in and the game was out of reach.
It was an absolutely dominant performance by the front seven, with Harvard applying incessant pressure on Bison QB Brandon Wesley, who had no time to throw behind his overmatched offensive line.
“That was one of the better front fours I’ve seen at this level of college football,” Bucknell coach Joe Susan said.
Wesley threw four interceptions, the first of which Crimson senior Brian Owusu snagged at the Harvard 25 and ran back 58 yards. Midway through the third quarter, freshman end Zach Hodges batted a ball up in the air that was grabbed by junior linebacker Brian Reilly at midfield for the second Crimson pick.
Freshman Norman Hayes and sophomore Chris Splinter would later intercept Wesley at the goal line on consecutive fourth-quarter drives, keeping Bucknell out of the end zone.
The Crimson now has the best turnover margin in the Ancient Eight.
“Our defense never gave them a chance today,” Murphy said. “[We] just put a stranglehold on them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Brown (8-4-1, 2-2-0 Ivy) only one point behind the Crimson in the Ivy League standings coming into the weekend, the Harvard women’s soccer team (9-4-1, 3-0-1) knew that Saturday afternoon’s game would be intense. Throw in brutal winds that caused uneven bounces, and this weekend’s match quickly became up for grabs.
In an exciting finish that saw two corner kicks and a free kick by the Bears within the last two minutes of play, Harvard barely managed to come out with a 2-1 win, extending its unbeaten streak to seven consecutive games.
“[Brown is] a good team—they’re having an amazing season,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “Lowest goals against in the league, and they’re a tough team to crack. And we didn’t crack them. It just literally could have gone either way.”
“We had a tough first half,” said rookie Mai Le, who scored the game-winner. “Brown came out and played amazing. They were unbelievable today, but somehow we managed to play together and pull out a win in the second half.”
After back-and-forth play from both sides featuring three close attempts by Harvard, the Bears scored first at the 15-minute mark. Brown junior Eliza Marshall sent a cross to teammate Kiersten Berg, who tipped it into the corner of the net to give her team the lead.
“An emotional game,” Leone added. “We really struggled today and I think it had a lot to do with Brown. They brought so much to the game. We did too, but we just weren’t playing well—we couldn’t get the ball on the ground. We just struggled with the conditions.”
Having rallied back against both Yale and Fairfield earlier this season, the Crimson took the halftime break to regroup and reevaluate.
“They’ve been here before so I really didn’t need to say anything,” Leone said. “I heard the team talking amongst themselves, and they were all positive things: it’s fine, it was a bad half, let’s move on. We didn’t even address the first half. The only thing we said about it was a comparison to last year; we played phenomenal last year in the first half against Brown and lost.”
In last year’s match, Alexandra Conigliaro, who is a Crimson sports comper, scored in the first half before Harvard allowed two Brown goals in the second 45 minutes. Hoping to do the same to the Bears this weekend, the Crimson came into the second half focused on the net.
Eleven minutes in, co-captain Lindsey Kowal placed a free kick directly in front of Brown’s goal. Deflecting off multiple players, the ball eventually found the foot of co-captain Melanie Baskind, who tied the game with a quick shot, 1-1.
“That’s why the game could have gone either way,” Leone said. “Because they had it bouncing around like crazy, and we had it bouncing around like crazy. But we got a bounce and it came to Mel, and she finished it.”
Five minutes later, Le recorded her first goal in a Harvard uniform, converting a pass from Casscells-Hamby eight yards out from the goal.
“To be honest, I’m just so relieved because the team worked so hard to get the ball up the field to where I was—it was a weight off my shoulders to put it in the goal,” Le said. “I remember looking up and seeing that the defenders were closing in and that the goalkeeper was off to the side, so I did my best to put it where she wasn’t.”
Le took her time to kick a carefully-placed shot into the right corner that evaded the goalkeeper and another defender running towards the net.
Brown refused to let up the rest of the half, taking a 14-4 advantage on shots and causing anguish on the Crimson bench.
“Was it five minutes or was it 105?” Leone joked. “I think we struggled keeping the ball, so we were giving them more opportunities. They would serve a ball in there, we’d struggle to clear it and that would add maybe two or three more shots. That’s why we’re really fortunate to get out of here with this win, because we didn’t play our style at all.”
Despite the pressure, Harvard goalkeeper Bethany Kanten made a career-high nine saves to grab the win for the Crimson.
“We knew that [Brown was] going to get forward and that they were going to get after us,” Kanten said. “You’ve got to play for the moment, you can’t even think a second ahead. You can’t think about the game ending in 30 seconds or a minute—you have to focus on right now.”
With three games left, Harvard remains at the top of the Ivy League as the only undefeated team, sitting in front of Yale and Penn, who both already lost to the Crimson this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With strong performances from both familiar names on the team as well as new contributors like freshman attacker Evan Ramsey, the Harvard mens’ water polo team brought a decisive end to its five-game losing streak.
The Crimson (6-10, 2-5 CWPA) split its matches at Blodgett Pool Saturday, beating Connecticut College (2-8, 1-1), 16-7, and losing to St. Francis (10-7, 5-0), 13-5. On Sunday, the Crimson secured its second victory of the weekend, edging Mercyhurst (11-7, 10-0), 10-9, in a back-and-forth match.
“It was a big step for us, getting these two wins,” Ramsey said. “If we had lost [these games], we would have been down. We were on a losing streak, and now we are starting a winning streak.”
HARVARD 10, MERCYHURST 9
After a low-scoring first half, the Crimson and the Lakers engaged in an onslaught of back-and-forth scoring. With just under a minute, the teams were knotted at 9-9, but a final shot by Ramsey would earn Harvard a 10-9 victory over Mercyhurst.
“[Crimson coach Ted Minnis] looks to me and says, ‘You have to put this away,’” Ramsey said. “He told me, ‘This one is on you.’ I figured I had to make it. I had to put it away, or I would beat myself up over it.”
With a pass from co-captain Kevin DiSilvestro, Ramsey nailed the winning goal to the back of the cage with a mere 25 seconds remaining on the clock.
“Everything that led up to it really pushed me to make that shot,” Ramsey said. “It felt great to make it.”
In the first half of the match, both the Crimson and the Lakers struggled to score. Mercyhurst tallied the sole goal of the opening quarter, and the half closed with a 4-2 score in favor of the Lakers.
But the second half represented a flipping of the switch. Co-captain Luka Babic got his second goal of the afternoon to begin Harvard’s 4-0 run, consisting of goals from freshman utility Max Murphy, sophomore attacker Will Roller, and another from Babic.
With 40 seconds remaining, Mercyhurst put one away in the otherwise Crimson-dominated quarter.
Harvard entered the fourth quarter up, 6-5. DiSilvestro began the prolific quarter with a tally for the home team, increasing the lead to 7-5, but it was quickly countered by a Laker goal just 20 seconds later. Mercyhurst tied things up at 7-7, but Harvard edged ahead again just moments later with a successful penalty shot.
But the Harvard lead was short lived. Two quick Laker goals tied the game once again with less than one minute of play left.
With 30 seconds remaining, DiSilvestro lobbed a pass to Ramsey, who would rocket the ball past the goalie to earn the team a 10-9 victory over Mercyhurst and its second win of the weekend.
HARVARD 16, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 7
The Crimson’s victory over Connecticut College marked a break in its five-game void of wins.
The Crimson took the lead early, exiting the second quarter with a 5-2 lead over the Camels. By halftime, the score had increased to 9-4, Harvard.
The Crimson continued to excel in the second half and triumphed 16-7 over Connecticut College.
Ramsey stepped up in a big way in Harvard’s win, doubling his career number of goals to 12 this weekend, five of which were scored in the match against Connecticut.
“I think what happened in the [Connecticut] game is he just started picking up the ball more and shooting it,” Popp said. “I mean the guy’s got a cannon. In practice, I’d say he is one of the toughest guys to block. He just decided with Connecticut College to pick it up and put it in the high corner … That is his bread and butter.”
But Ramsey was not the only one putting up big numbers. Defensively, Popp had 10 saves, and sophomore attacker Hank Clausner logged four steals. Offensively, DiSilvestro had three goals, and Babic and freshman two-meter John Holland-McCowan had two apiece.
“[The Conneticut College victory] was our first win in a while, and I thought we played well on all ends of the pool,” Minnis said. “We put the ball away when we needed to put the ball away, so it was a good day. I think everybody had fun and that is what we are trying to get to.”
ST. FRANCIS 13, HARVARD 5
The Crimson faced No. 15 St. Francis in its first game of the weekend.
Harvard kept pace with the powerhouse in the first quarter.
“We started off real strong,” Ramsey said. “This was a team that was supposed to blow us out, and we were pushing to the limits and always giving a 110 percent.”
Going into the second half, the Crimson trailed by a single point, 3-2.
But the Bernie’s size and strength proved too great, and St. Francis blew Harvard out of the water, 13-5.
“They started optimizing on our mistakes and started making shots and counterattacking—they started benefitting off of our losses,” Ramsey said. “And we just kind of let it get out of control.”
“They just got a couple power goals, and they just started rolling,” Popp added.
Though St. Francis earned the winning tally, Harvard didn’t walk away completely defeated.
“The score doesn’t reflect how well we played,” Minnis said. “Considering they are the No. 15 team in the nation and some of our guys were out, it was a good effort.”

Competing against some of the top teams in the nation, Harvard’s men and women’s cross country teams had a run for their money—or for their ranking.
On Friday, the teams competed at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational. The women’s team came in 40th place out of 43 teams, scoring two runners in the top 200 of the “A” race. Individually, the men’s team had a strong outing in the “B” race, as five of its runners ranked in the top 60.
“I was really pleased with the progression that we made from two weeks ago,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “We competed well and saw an important improvement, but also some technical things to improve on before the championship meet two weeks from now.”
Many players used the race to gain experience, as the invitational presented an unusually competitive field for Harvard.
“I think the meet was a good stepping stone for the things coming up for us later in the season,” sophomore Aaron Watanabe said. “The meet gave us a chance to get in a good race.  It also gave us the opportunity for some guys to travel out to a meet and show that they’re ready to run at a high level.”
In a meet stacked with several of the best teams in the country, Watanabe ran the eight-kilometer race in a time of 25:24, good for 13th place overall and first for the Crimson.
But, he was still not completely satisfied with his performance.
“It was an interesting race because we were racing against teams we have never competed against before,” Watanabe said. “I didn’t know what to expect. It didn’t quite play out like I hoped, but it seems like a good experience for me to know what it’s like to run towards the front of a race.”
Watanabe’s performance was not the only notable run of the day, as junior Jakob Lindaas placed 36th overall with a time of 25:54, followed by freshman Will Geikan, who completed the race in 25:58.
Several of Harvard’s top runners were noticeably missing from the lineup, among them sophomore James Leakos and freshman Billy Orman, the two top runners for the Crimson from the last meet.
“They had some things that were bothering them, so they were being cautious,” Watanabe said. “But it gave the guys that did go out a really good chance to start getting the mindset of being serious competitors.”
Saretsky expects Leakos to be ready for the Ivy League championships.
“He’s a little banged up,” Saretsky said. “James is such a competitor and is having such a great season that we didn’t want to take that unnecessary risk at Wisconsin.”
The competition for the women’s team was no less fierce. Among the squads present were Villanova and Providence, ranked first and second nationally, respectively. Senior Jeanne Mack led Harvard with a 171st-place finish (21:43), followed by fellow senior Kailyn Kuzmuk (21:43), who came in 198th. Freshman Viviana Hanley rounded off Harvard’s top three, as she finished 203rd (21:43).
“I think our women’s team has a really tight pack, from our No. 1 runner to our No. 5 runner,” Saretsky said. “From that point, we are doing a really good job of running together. Going into the championship, having that pack is key.”
The Crimson was supposed to run at the Brown Invitational on Friday as well, but due to external conditions, the decision was made to forego the race.
“We decided to not compete at Brown because of the weather,” Saretsky said. “The amount of rain affected it, and the course can be a little iffy to begin with—there is already much mud and a lot of roots on that course.”
Right now, Harvard is focused on building on the results from this meet and progressing together as a unit, rainy weather or not.
“As a team, we’re really looking forward to getting everyone back and healthy,” Watanabe said. “Then, we can really focus on having good team results. We certainly have the pieces to put together a really good championship race.”

In the final tournament of the fall season, the Harvard women’s golf team tied for second after entering the final round with a seven-stroke lead at the Boston Golf Club.
“It’s a disappointing result,” said Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads of the second annual Harvard Invitational. “We definitely were looking forward to seeing if we could win our home tournament, our last tournament of the fall, and be undefeated against all of the Ivies in the tournaments we played this fall.”
Yet it was not meant to be for the Crimson, as the squad of five golfers combined to shoot 331 Sunday after posting a score of 311 in the first round. With a total score of 642, Harvard tied Columbia University for second place, finishing five behind the University of Pennsylvania.
“We didn’t have a huge lead over Penn to start the round, so just a few strokes difference between players in each group was enough to make them catch up to us,” captain Christine Cho said. “Some bad holes and big numbers cost us the round.”
While the Quakers did ultimately best the Crimson, Harvard sophomore Bonnie Hu, who is also a member of The Crimson’s business board, and freshman Tiffany Lim individually finished second and third, respectively—better than any individual player from Penn.
Rhoads said the course played a large role in the team’s disappointing round Sunday.
“On the scorecard, they are not hard holes, but in actual fact, they play very difficult unless you really control your golf balls,” he said. “The wind and the layout combination are what made the scores so high [Sunday].”
The Crimson wasn’t the only team affected by tough playing conditions, as other competitors posted scores as high as 10 or 12 on single holes.
“[Sunday] was supposed to be an easier day weather-wise, but the average score was something like 88, which is super crazy,” Rhoads said.
According to the coach, Saturday’s results were more indicative of the team’s level of play. The fast start may have been due in part to extra motivation after Harvard’s ninth-place finish at the Nittany Lion Invitational. None of the Crimson golfers finished higher than 15th, and the team returned home without a trophy in tow for the first time this season.
“The team was motivated a little bit by the previous week, and they had more time to prepare than they did for Penn State, so we saw some good scores accordingly,” Rhoads said.
Even in the first round, there was room for improvement.
“Our four and five [players’] scores weren’t quite as good. The conditions didn’t quite suit [them],” Rhoads said.
Although the weekend’s action took place less than 40 minutes away in Hingham, Mass., the team was unable to fully benefit from its home-court advantage.
“We played the tournament as a host team but it was a course we were unfamiliar with just like everyone else. We only had one and half more practice rounds than everyone else,” Rhoads said.
While the team may be proud of its play Saturday, no one was boasting after the tournament was over.
“It was sad to end the season on a low note because the team failed to win its home tournament,” Cho said.
Still, both the captain and her coach were happy with the fall season as a whole. Before its second-place finish this weekend, the team had won two tournaments during the fall slate of four contests.
“It’s easy to say you need to change a lot of things just because this tournament didn’t finish quite as you wanted it to,” Rhoads said. “But Penn is the only Ivy team to beat us in any tournament this fall. We have a winning record against every [Ivy]. It was a disappointing one day.”
In fact, Rhoads said he saw a silver lining in the lackluster finish to the fall campaign.
“I think it will affect us in a positive way,” he said. “When you have a finish that’s worse than what you expect, it can harm your confidence of course but it also tends to be fuel. My hope is that it provides fuel for them to keep working hard throughout the offseason.”
Cho backed up her coach’s sentiments.
“Some of us felt embarrassed about our scores today,” she said. “It will definitely be motivation in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
This past Sunday, Buffalo Bill’s quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, was hoping to build off of his momentum from a good start to the season with a win against division rival, the New York Giants—but in the end, a couple of costly mistakes from the Harvard alum proved too much for Buffalo to overcome.
The loss pushed the Bills to a record of 4-2 on the season.
On Sunday’s showing, Fitzpatrick threw for two touchdowns and 244 yards against the Giants. Despite making some good plays, the former Harvard quarterback’s errors in the second half ultimately were too much to oversome.
With 4:10 left in the fourth quarter and the game tied at 24, Fitzpatrick was driving his offense deep in New York territory when he under-threw wide receiver Stevie Johnson and the ball was picked off by the Giants at their four-yard line—ending the Bill’s chances of improving to 5-1.
Whether or not this was a factor on Sunday’s game, Fitzpatrick holds the distinction of being the only quarterback in the NFL to play with his wedding ring. Most quarterbacks either take their rings off or tape them before games. While it is unclear whether the ring affected his play, it is apparent that the former Crimson is quite the family man.
This upcoming week, Fitzpatrick and the Bills will have a bye.
Elsewhere in the league, Baltimore Ravens’ center, Matt Birk ’98, contributed to a successful Baltimore offensive line.  Against the Houston Texans, Baltimore’s offensive line enabled a solid running game that rushed for 113 yards.
The Ravens comfortably beat the Texans 29-14, putting Baltimore 4-1 on the season—good enough for first place in the AFC North.

Before the celebration (and the rain) officially began, we asked people around the Yard about their excitement and expectations for Harvard's 375th Birthday Bash. No surprise here, there was one big thing on most people's minds: CAKE.

Anyone who has walked through the Yard lately may have noticed that Tercentenary Theatre is still recovering from a rough weekend of partying. The combination of rain and thousands of wandering feet at last Friday's 375th Anniversary Celebration have left the grass (much of which has been replaced by dirt and mud) looking less than spectacular. Fortunately, Facilities Maintenance Operations has plans in the works to restore the Yard to its former grandeur."Because it's too late in the year to plant grass seeds, [Landscaping Services] is going to install sod around the edges of the walkways and in the middle of Tercentenary Theatre," said Harvard University Public Information Officer Tania M. deLuzuriaga. She said that Landscaping Services is accustomed to dealing with both large campus events and the heavy traffic that the Yard sees each day.
"Having experienced other events where it has rained, they were expecting that they were going to have to do some work. Hundreds of thousands of people walk through Tercentenary Theatre each year, so Yard maintenance is part of what [Landscaping Services] does regularly," she said.
Sod installation will begin on Tuesday, and although the repairs are weather dependent, Landscaping Services hopes to have the Yard restored by the end of the week.
