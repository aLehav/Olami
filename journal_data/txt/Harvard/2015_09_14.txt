After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference a week makes. Not six days ago, University President Drew G. Faust broke her long silence on final clubs to denounce them as focal points of campus elitism, sexism, and sexual assault. Two days later, these pages broke the story that the Spee Club had begun to invite women to punch. It was, without a doubt, a historic move, and a good one, too.
As President Faust rightly says, final clubs in their current form are dangerous to the fabric of life at the College. To hear her say or imply what many Harvard undergraduates have no doubt long thought—that final clubs are socioeconomically elite, that final clubs are exclusionary, that final clubs have money and means far beyond the run-of-the-mill extracurricular, and crucially, that final clubs self-select to ensure the propagation and perpetuation of this privilege—was a refreshing change from her typically reserved leadership style. No doubt the changes at the Spee have been in the works since before President Faust sat down with The Crimson last week, but her public statements are still very welcome.
It would be a mistake, however, to think that becoming co-ed is a panacea. Of course, the exclusion of women from all-male final clubs is an enormous issue. With women as members, hopefully final clubs will be more welcoming spaces for individuals of all genders, with parties planned with more of an eye to everyone’s safety. Yet huge issues still remain. Even if final clubs include women, the self-selected nature of the punch process combined with the socioeconomic inequality that President Faust spoke of ensures that huge obstacles remain to final clubs serving as productive forces on campus. Bastions of exclusivity and privilege—much like final clubs today—are fundamentally incompatible with any vision of a more inclusive Harvard.
Given that the final clubs are private institutions, Harvard's can best retake ownership of its social culture by building inclusive alternatives on campus. Currently, there are very few on-campus spaces where students can pursue a variety of social activities. The final clubs have drawn much of their popularity and mystique by filling this void. Were the College to promote more on-campus social activity, fewer students would feel drawn to off campus parties. Regardless of whether other final clubs follow the Spee, the University should work toward greater inclusivity by providing and fostering alternatives to a Friday night spent on Mount Auburn Street.
The good news, though, is that this week has been a good one for inclusion. It may have been more incremental than transformative, more forced than inspired, and so long overdue as to hardly be progressive, but it is a first step in the right direction. We now should apply ourselves to the next steps: more inclusive and more effective social spaces, both on and off campus. Let’s make better Houses, better dorms, and yes, better final clubs. After all, the journey to a better Harvard begins with a first step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Maurice: An eccentric inventor but loving father who supports Belle's dreams... He is made a prisoner until Belle exchanges her freedom for his.” —Disney Wiki
When I told my father last semester that I was performing in a spoken word play called “Unspoken,” the conversation went something like this:
“What I say about bullshit activities?”
—(Well, bullshit isn’t the most suitable adjective for a visceral art…)—
“What I say, you remember?”
—(You say that you didn’t immigrate for me to waste a Harvard degree or scribble “people notes” on the back of a CVS receipt. That riches to rags is not how the story goes, is not what you bargained for when your left your roach-infested apartment in Karachi for a shoddier dorm room in a more photogenic city, living off Burger King coupons and the distant vision that, just maybe, your progeny would be everything you weren’t...)—.
“Aisha, you hear me? WHAT I say?”
“You say that I shouldn’t do them, the bullshit activities. That I should slow down more, like Maurice.”
He cleared his throat; I sighed; and the call ended just as I heard him say—almost in awe that his words had endured—“That’s right.”
***
In “Unspoken,” I played a character who rushed through life, burning relationships before she ever arrived at their bridges. Longing, through long-form soliloquies, for a deep and raw kind of intimacy. She saw her life as a narrative—easier to write than to live, to backspace away an experience like bad prose than to retrospectively return, again and again, to a taxing psychological space.
The parallels were not lost on me.
I spent rehearsals vacillating between feeling like the shit or just like shit. Between feeling like a fraud, or like an open book wanting for someone to read it all. I lingered there, between two realities; between the lines I memorized and the ones I said in section or to a friend in the Yard.
I lingered there, amazed and confused and disturbed by how closely I identified with another’s script. By how long I’d been living by one. By how much mine needed to be rewritten.
So when I stood on stage—fictitious but authentic—and proclaimed, “I am learning it’s untelling,” I wanted my dad to be there, sitting and listening. I wanted him to hear in those words an apology for how I’d fucked up the South Asian trope with my silly poetry and aversion to chemistry, to hear how it had fucked me up, too.
I wanted him to hear, in this story, a bit of my story. A bit of his own, even.
But once we bowed and the crowd snapped in applause and flowers appeared, there was only this: The director waved to her mother. The tech designer hugged hers. A cast member, speaking in rapid Dutch, answered a call from her parents. And I received my daily text.
“hi aisha. how you been? hope you studying.”
***
On the last day of May, hours before I left home for the summer, I heard some of the screaming that formed, for close to nineteen years, the soundtrack to which I’ve lived.
It was my parents. And, as usual, they were arguing.
My mom was cleaning and had swept my “Unspoken” program into the trash by mistake.
My dad saw. “WHAT you doing?” he cried. “You crazy?”
I didn’t know what to make of his outrage. Was it just a convenient way to blame my mom, again, for something or the other? Did he share my reverence for the thinning and fraying sheet? Did this matter?
My mom, exhausted and weary, retreated to the kitchen. My dad, bitter and strained, asked me to follow him upstairs.
He was cleaning out his closet and needed my help.
I stood there, hands empty, while he emptied out suitcases and shoeboxes and emerged, finally, with a thinning and fraying sheet that looked suspiciously like the one he’d rescued.
“Read this,” he said.
It was a program. For a rendition of “Beauty and the Beast.” Staged by graduate students at the State University of New York at Buffalo. His alma mater.
And, sure enough, there was his name. Not next to MAURICE, though. Or GASTON. But STAGEHAND.
“I carried wood,” he said.
He was an avid reader in Pakistan, he continued. Hamlet. Romeo and Juliet. He was familiar with them. He’d analyzed them, too—if you can call stumbling over them in breathless urgency a form of literary scrutiny.
So as soon as he enrolled he knew what he’d do: Recite these verses aloud. Act.
“I’m sorry, honey,” the director told him after he auditioned for the lone play produced that semester. She was a little shocked at this brown, middle-aged man saying eagerly, but in broken speech, that he wanted to be the beast. Or, at the very least, Maurice.
“We can’t have you in a lead.”
But he came back the next day. And the next. For callbacks he was never called to participate in.
He lingered, sitting and listening and miming the words delivered by blonde and brunet, hazel and blue-eyed men, whose great-great grandfathers had suffered and thrived and eventually arrived at an unwelcoming island so their great-great grandsons could open their mouths. And speak.
“Fine,” the director said at the end of casting week. “You can help with equipment, handling shit behind the scenes.”
So he did.
“I memorized more play than real beast,” he insisted. “And Maurice.”
And I’m sure he did.
I’m sure that this was some sort of retelling.
I’m sure that this added a few lines to his script, or mine, or some other one; a meta-narrative encompassing all the rest, interwoven with dialogue from here; a plot resolution from over there; a scene in which I’m sitting and listening and hearing in my dad’s words that together we’ve been writing a large and scrawled “fuck you” to the South Asian trope, to the immigrant family trope, to all fucking tropes. That together we’ve been fucked up by writing, ours and that of others, too.
I’m sure that this was long overdue, this beautiful and beastly and intergenerational cyclicality.
I’m sure that me writing this is some sort of retelling, too.
Of a lingering pain from my fractured, but mending, relationship with my dad; of a lingering need for aesthetic validation in spaces meant for unrestrained creation. Of a slow but steadily evolving dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Judge not, that ye be judged,” Jesus; “Who are you to judge me/And the life I live,” Bob Marley; “Who am I to judge,” Pope Francis; “So please don’t judge me/And I won’t judge you,” Chris Brown.
Along with these great luminaries and song-birds, many of my peers have expressed an aversion for judgment and judging. It seems that almost every day I hear the refrain, often accompanied by a shrug or sigh, “but who am I to judge?” or, “well, I don’t want to be judgmental.” However, the general anti-judgment feelings—a distaste for distaste—strike me as odd. Judgment and the judgmental, far from deserving scorn, ought to be appreciated and embraced. Judgment, I hope to show, arises not out of contempt but of compassion, and it is necessary for self-knowledge and improvement.
At this point, before I get into the heart of the matter, I should make clear that I am talking only about judgments made in good faith. This is judgment made with sincere intentions, which I contrast with judgment made for the purpose of making fun, embarrassing, or belittling. Surely there are those who judge only to put others down, and I think we can all agree that such judgments are rebarbative and undesirable.
But what about the judgments, commonly expressed (not exclusively) by our friends, family, and teachers, that clearly are not intended to humiliate? What purpose do they serve, and how should we think of them?
When someone judges me in good faith, he does so because he believes that I am making a mistake: the judgment is meant to both inform me of my error and offer a correction. It indicates the concern the person has for my well being or, at least, for the pernicious effects my wrong action might have on the community in general.
An example might go a long way in illuminating my point. One of my roommates, a Green REP, would judge me if I left my room without turning off the lights. The judgments he would issue (“Hey, if you can remember, it’s really not good to leave your lights on,” or, “You should try to turn your lights off.”) either were motivated by environmental consciousness (a general concern), a desire that I should not turn into a wasteful or thoughtless person (a personal concern), or both. Far from being malicious or taking delight in an opportunity to rebuke me, my friend had a genuine desire to see my behavior corrected.
I could have responded to his judgments in any number of ways—I could have ignored them, lashed out at him, or even have tried to rationalize my behavior. To do any of those, however, would not afford my friend his due share of respect, as it would fail to take seriously his sincere concern and desire. Instead, therefore, I used his judgments as an occasion to evaluate my actions and ultimately change them. Leaving my room, his words began to echo in my ears, and either out of a sense of shame, or a new desire to be more environmentally conscious myself, I started always turning my lights off.
Even when one faces judgment and decides not to change one’s behavior, the criticism still serves a purpose. Judgment makes one aware of exactly what he is doing—so often we act without thought—and forces him to consciously commit to it. It keeps us from going through life without questioning our established practices and habits, and it gives us an opportunity for introspection.
I should also point out that our discomfort with judgment is selective. Who does not judge the boor who speaks endlessly about himself? Or the bigot who hates? Somewhat paradoxically, I am sure most people judge those who refrain from judging the truly obnoxious and nauseous.
And who would want to live in a world where no one judged? In such a place, those callous individuals who do not care to do the right thing, or those who do not know what the right thing to do is, would never be corrected. How many of us have gone out of our way to properly recycle our waste only after we have felt the silent judgment of watching eyes? The other problem with a judgment-free world is what is says about those who could judge but do not. They either have so little confidence in their conception of the good that they are ashamed to offer it to others, or they care so little for their peers that they cannot be troubled to stop their peers from making mistakes, grave or trivial.
Admittedly, I have used benign examples: turning off the lights, recycling, not being boorish. But the point still holds for more controversial examples. When I judge my fellow Jewish friends for not observing the high holidays, I sincerely believe I am doing them a service. When my friends judge me for not using politically correct speech, I know that they are looking out for what they believe to be my well-being. I therefore welcome their judgment. To me, it is a sign of compassion, proof that people care that I live a good life.

UPDATED: September 14, 2015, at 3:04 a.m.
Police reported an active shooter near MIT’s Cambridge campus late Sunday afternoon.
Following reports of a gunshot victim, MIT and Cambridge police were searching the area around Main and Portland Streets—just a few blocks north of the famous MIT Great Dome—and asked residents to stay clear of the area, according to an emergency alert on MIT’s website.
MIT officials initially circulated an emergency notification to students warning of an active shooter on campus, but soon retracted it, clarifying that the incident occurred just off campus.
According to the Cambridge Police, the shooting occurred nearby a 7-11 convenience store at about 4:24 p.m., when a "large group of people" were at the Cambridge Carnival.One victim, a 25-year-old female Roxbury resident, suffered a gunshot to her leg, and the injury appeared to be non-life threatening, according to police. They are still investigating the incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Athletics Department renamed Soldiers Field last week in honor of former Crimson football tight end Gerald R. Jordan ’61. Soldiers Field, which served as the home of the men’s and women’s varsity lacrosse and soccer teams for five years, is now called Jordan Field.
To accommodate the name change, Harvard has also changed the name of the current Jordan Field—the home of the field hockey team—to the Harvard Field Hockey Stadium.
The field hockey field was renamed in 2000 in honor of a donation made by Jordan, who goes by Jerry. The Athletics Department declined to comment on the size of the gift.
According to a press release, there are plans to relocate both the field hockey and rugby teams, but administrators have not yet finalized any arrangements. The men’s rugby team is a club sport, while the women’s rugby team became Harvard's 42nd varsity sports team two years ago.
"We are incredibly grateful to Jerry Jordan '61 for his willingness to make possible the transfer of the Jordan Field naming rights," Harvard Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise said in the release. "By allowing us to transfer the Jordan Field name to our lacrosse and soccer stadium, he has provided us with the flexibility to pursue field enhancements impacting several of our other programs."
Jordan, a Boston area native who also graduated Harvard Business School in 1967, has been a large contributor to the school’s financial aid program since graduating. During the ’95-’96 academic year, Jordan endowed a scholarship fund in his family’s name with a $5 million gift to provide financial aid for up to 16 College students a year. By 2010, Jordan and his family supported the largest number of scholars on campus of any living Harvard alumni donor, with 39 students.
“I [chose] to make a gift to Harvard because it is an institution I love,” Jordan said in 2010. “I grew immensely while an undergraduate, and I owe that opportunity to the financial aid Harvard offered me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The same day that one of Harvard’s all-male final clubs positioned itself to admit women, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana refused to say whether he was at all involved in the historic decision.
And as administrators place greater scrutiny on the unrecognized social clubs, Khurana also would not rule out the possibility that Harvard will put more administrative pressure on the groups to regulate them, saying in an interview Friday that “there is nothing off the table.”
Khurana praised the Spee Club on Friday for its decision to become the first of the College’s eight all-male final clubs to invite women to participate in its punch process, when the group puts prospective members up for entry. “It contributes to strengthening an example and a model to our students who too often believe things can’t change,” he said.
Khurana, however, stopped short of acknowledging having any involvement, if he did, in the decision.
It remains unclear exactly how the Spee came to its historic vote. The vice president of the club’s graduate board, John G. Hanson ’80, called the decision “inevitable” and said support for adding women to the group has been “growing for several years now.”
Still, the move comes in the wake of increased administrative scrutiny on the club and its peer organizations. The Spee attracted attention last spring when it circulated a controversial party invitation that some people deemed sexist. And multiple people—including final club graduate board members and University President Drew G. Faust—have said Khurana, a relatively new dean, has been meeting with final club leaders and alumni. He is scheduled to meet with their graduate board leaders later this month.
Khurana has publicly criticized Harvard’s single-sex social clubs, which remain officially unrecognized by the College but are mostly located just off campus.
Repeatedly prompted on whether he had spoken with Spee Club leaders about going co-ed, Khurana responded only in broad statements.
“I try to be open to engagement with all members of our community to facilitate and enable dialogue and discussion, and to really encourage people to discuss among themselves ways that feel appropriate to them and align themselves to things that are generative,” Khurana said.
Khurana maintained that he speaks with all leaders of organizations who approach him and that he “never” reveals the identities of the groups he meets with or what they discuss. Citing similar reasoning, he also declined to comment on whether he or anyone on his behalf has specifically suggested to final club leaders that they welcome women to their memberships.
Khurana did, however, acknowledge that he is crafting a set of recommendations about campus social life and unrecognized social groups. He would not offer any details on what those recommendations include or when they will be done, although he did say “stakeholders” will discuss them.
“We've been putting together some ideas that people have suggested to us and began looking at the various possibilities of what those could take,” Khurana said. “We're not far along enough where I could say something is in or out.”
Khurana also broadly alluded to conversations he has had with unrecognized social organizations about the possibility of “a different kind of relationship with the College that's not just an unrecognized status.”
The final clubs have remained unrecognized by Harvard since they refused to admit women in 1984, but to date, administrators navigate a precarious relationship with the groups behind the scenes, even as they criticize them publicly.
Khurana declined to elaborate Friday on how that arrangement might change going forward, but he declined to rule out the possibility of administrators pursuing an action similar to Amherst College, which barred students last year from joining unrecognized fraternities and sororities.
Khurana distanced himself from the prospect of using Administrative Board sanctions to pressure the groups, but he would not say that administrators are not using them. The College is not “driven by notions of sanctions,” Khurana maintained, and does not wish to be autocratic with recommendations. Still, he said, “there is nothing off the table.”
Prompted in a follow-up question about the potential legal pushback the College could face if it followed Amherst’s example to bar students from joining unrecognized social clubs, Khurana closed off questions on the topic.
“I’m not going to talk anymore about it,” he said of the final clubs. “No comment, no comment, no comment.”
Khurana declined to comment on a series of questions, including the topics he plans to discuss with final club graduate board leaders at their upcoming meeting and his thoughts generally on the place of fraternities and sororities at the College.
Instead, Khurana repeatedly said that combating perceived exclusivity in final clubs and the College’s social scene is not the “biggest of [his] priorities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than three decades after splitting ties with Harvard because it refused to add women to its membership, one all-male final club drew praise from the College’s top leader for opening its punch process to women, though some other campus constituents remain skeptical.
The Spee Club, the all-male final club founded in 1852 and based at 76 Mount Auburn St., slipped invitations to its first punch event under the doors of some undergraduate women’s dorm rooms, putting them up for entry to the organization.
On a nearly 400-year-old campus where the pace of change sometimes seems glacial, the move was historic. The Spee, one of eight male final clubs at Harvard with large Cambridge properties and endowments to match, now stands positioned to become the first to go co-ed.
And Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana is taking note. “I want to really applaud and give my encouragement to the Spee to continue to be a model of leadership,” Khurana said in an interview Friday.
An outspoken critic of single-sex social organizations and what he has called “exclusivity” in all spheres of undergraduate life, Khurana said the Spee’s move serves as a positive example for other organizations, including the other seven male final clubs that have not yet indicated that they have plans to accept women this punch season.
“It contributes to strengthening an example and a model to our students who too often believe things can’t change,” Khurana said.
The laudation is a far cry from the harsh language Khurana used last semester when he condemned a controversial party invitation that the Spee sent to some undergraduates, drawing accusations of sexism.
On campus this weekend, students largely praised the Spee’s move to invite women to participate in punch, but some questioned whether the decision will effectively combat what they describe as other problems they associate with male final clubs.
Undergraduate Council representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, who introduced an strongly worded piece of legislation last spring condemning final clubs after the Spee party invitation incident, said the Spee’s decision showed that progress is possible in old institutions.
Levine, an inactive Crimson news writer, characterized the Spee’s move in mostly positive terms, saying that he hopes that other final clubs will follow suit to mitigate exclusivity on campus. He called that “probably the most important issue to student life right now at Harvard College.”
Other students called for a different response.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, who previously called for the dismantling of final clubs, said she was “cautiously unimpressed” with the Spee’s decision. Specifically, Suslovic said the move by itself may do little to increase the transparency of final clubs and the representation of all students in the groups.
“There's a lot of, I think, bigger issues with… these clubs overall, and so I don’t think that by welcoming women into the clubs we'll actually see any of those other problems addressed,” said Suslovic, who is also a columnist for The Crimson’s editorial board.
Suslovic added that she hopes the Spee will more thoroughly explain why the club, now more than 150 years old, just now decided to involve women in its selection process.
Administrators have recently increased public scrutiny on final clubs. Khurana, who has met with club leaders several times since he became dean last year, has declined to say whether he at all tried to influence the Spee to go co-ed.
Mitchell L. Dong ’75, an alumnus of the all-male Fly Club and a former vice president of its graduate board, congratulated the Spee’s decision, characterizing the club as “cutting edge.” Dong, who said he was speaking for himself and not on behalf of the Fly, said he thinks other groups are watching the Spee with close interest. But changes within final clubs often take a long time, he added.
There is a large demand from students to be in final clubs and Greek life, Dong said, citing the record number of bids sororities extended to women on campus last spring. Dong, a major donor to Harvard, said he agrees with administrative concerns about the need for alcohol safety and sexual assault prevention at the clubs, but he said he thinks administrators should allow the groups to exist.
“Dean Khurana says the House community is good enough,” Dong said. “Well, I don’t think it’s good enough. I don’t think they should stop these single-gendered organizations from popping up if that’s what the students want.”
How the Spee’s move will affect other final clubs, which are now beginning their own fall punch processes, still remains unclear. On schedule, some final clubs—both male and female—gave out invitations to their first punch events this weekend, and final club graduate board leaders will meet with Khurana later this month.
For the women invited to punch the Spee, though, the next challenge is navigating the first event, scheduled for Thursday.
Katherine H. Scott ’18 plans to go to the reception. She said she was surprised to receive the invitation from the Spee last week and praised the club’s move to extend punch invitations to women.
“At first I was sort of in disbelief,” said Scott, who is also a Crimson sports writer. “I thought it was a female final club, because I wasn't expecting it to be from the Spee.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As they have for recent fall semesters, two of Harvard’s flagship undergraduate classes—one in computer science and the other in economics—are vying for the position of the College’s largest fall course.
As of Sunday evening, Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” had enrolled just barely more undergraduates than Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” with 701 undergraduates compared to 697, respectively. By this point last fall, CS50 had surpassed the economics course in enrollment, breaking a record.
In terms of overall course enrollment numbers—which count student enrollees hailing from the Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences, cross-registered programs, and elsewhere—CS50 outnumbers Ec 10 by nearly 100 students: 804 total students, compared to 707. CS50’s continued success in drawing hundreds of students comes on the heels of the program’s continued presence online and its recent expansion to Yale.
Famous Government professor Michael J. Sandel’s General Education course Ethical Reasoning 39: “Money, Markets, and Morals” has the third largest undergraduate enrollment, with 514 College students enrolled as of Sunday evening. And Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology” was the College’s fourth largest class, also as of Sunday evening, with 431 undergraduates enrolled.
Students enrolled in courses online for the first time this year, through the recently overhauled my.harvard website. It tabulated enrollment numbers, a departure from last year, when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar collected paper study cards, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said. The data, this semester and going forward with the site, collect in real time.
“[W]e have actual enrollments,” Burke said. “And we have had actual enrollments since Sept. 2.”
From that date through the study card submission deadline last Thursday, when students enrolled in a course, faculty members could see students’ names as they appeared on their rosters.
“There [was] a lot of traffic every day,” Burke said. “Everything about our work is entirely new, and we’re experiencing it for the first time just like students and everybody else.”
Add/drop period, when students can change their course schedules, starts this week and continues through Sept. 21. After that date, students will be charged a fee for enrolling in new courses or dropping old ones from their schedules.
Until then, it is remains to be seen whether CS50 will edge out Ec 10.

Harvard topped many of its peer institutions on key metrics like affordability, graduation rates, and alumni salaries detailed on the U.S. Department of Education’s new college scorecard, officially released this weekend.
The final version of the scorecard departs from previous Obama Administration plans, which called for explicit rating of colleges against one another, and instead provides school-specific data for students to compare colleges. 
Harvard’s scorecard highlights a graduation rate of 97 percent and an average salary 10 years after graduating of $87,200—the highest in the Ivy League. The national post-graduation salary for college students is $34,343, which is almost $10,000 more than the national average earnings of high school graduates, six years after enrolling, according to a White House fact sheet.
Though the cost of Harvard College’s tuition, including room and board without financial aid is $60,659, Harvard offers significant aid for students from low-income backgrounds, making its average annual cost $14,049, as calculated on the scorecard. Harvard had better overall ratings than its West Coast competitor Stanford, which had an average cost of $15,713, a 95 percent graduation rate, and a $80,900 post-graduation salary.
The scorecard also breaks down several other metrics including student body demographics, average SAT and ACT scores, and financial aid.
Two years ago, in light of increasing price tags for a college education President Barack Obama first unveiled his plan to create a centralized government site that would stack schools up against one another. From the beginning, the planned rating system was met with criticism from many higher education leaders, including University President Drew G. Faust, who sounded off about Obama’s proposal in interviews with The Crimson and letters to national newspapers.
“Making college more affordable for students and families is a fundamental goal that we in higher education are dedicated to support,” Faust wrote in a letter to the editor published in The New York Times in February 2013.
And though Harvard graduates’ salaries grossly exceed the average, Faust criticized scoring colleges based on the wages of their alumni. “When we decide what to measure, we signal what counts. Equating the value of education with the size of a first paycheck badly distorts broader principles and commitments essential to our society and our future,” she wrote in 2013.
On Saturday during his weekly address, more than two years after Faust’s op-ed, Obama praised the Education Department’s scorecard in remarks, arguing that it focuses on college affordability more than other popular college rankings.
“Right now, however, many existing college rankings reward schools for spending more money and rejecting more students–at a time when America needs our colleges to focus on affordability and supporting all students who enroll,” Obama said Saturday. “That doesn’t make sense, and it has to change.”
Harvard, however, is waiting to judge. “We are still assessing the new College Scorecard and the wide array of data released by the Department of Education yesterday,” University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email. “We appreciate the rich dialogue with the administration over the last months and share their deep interest in improving access, affordability, and success in higher education.”
The release of the scorecard preceded by one day new plans for FAFSA applications, which allow students to begin applying for financial aid starting Oct. 1 instead of in January.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the deadline for candidates was extended by 12 hours, 136 students declared their candidacy for the Undergraduate Council on Saturday. 
As usual, the number of freshman candidates outpaced that of upperclassman candidates, with 74 members of the Class of 2019 intending to campaign for 12 available positions. In contrast, the lack of upperclassmen pursuing positions on the UC prompted the Council to extend the deadline to declare by 12 hours.
UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 sent emails over at least three House email lists, encouraging students to run for vacant seats on the Council. In an email sent over an email list in Currier House, for example, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal wrote, “There are 3 open spots for UC Reps in Currier House, but the number of candidates is very low.”
Even with the extension and pleas for candidates, two Houses, Currier and Dunster, remain non-competitive this election cycle.
While the Council sought out upperclassmen to fill House representative positions, they had no trouble convincing freshmen to run. At least a dozen freshmen in each of the four freshmen Yards are pursuing a position on the Council. In Elm Yard, 25 students submitted declarations, a number Goyal called “historic.”
The UC’s campaign and voting period will commence on Tuesday at noon and end at noon on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the previous week’s 5-2 win at home over Bryant, the Harvard field hockey team could not keep up the momentum, falling to Maine by a 7-1 score.
The Crimson (1-2) found itself in a tight defensive contest against the Black Bears (5-1) in the first half, without any scoring occurring before the 19th minute. Even so, Maine set the pace of the game from the beginning, taking two shots on goal in the first four-plus minutes.
The Black Bears broke through against the Harvard defense at the 19:09 mark a few seconds after a penalty corner to notch the first point of the game. Another Maine goal a little over a minute later widened the lead to 2-0, but that would end the scoring before the intermission.
But the Black Bears would come out of the break operating on a higher gear, as the group tallied four straight goals in a 16-minute time frame to break the contest open. By the time captain Elizabeth Jacobson staved off a shutout, there was less than 90 seconds left in the game for Harvard to make up the rest of the deficit.
An added exclamation point for Maine was an unassisted goal from freshman back Delaney Baxendale, her first of the season, as time expired.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After ending last season on a tear, winning 11 of its last 12 games, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has gotten off to a slow start in its follow-up campaign.
The team traveled to Arlington, Va., to participate in the Service Academy Challenge, only to come away from the weekend without a win. The Crimson (1-5) has now dropped five straight games after winning its opener to start off the season.
“Obviously not winning is always hard,” junior Grace Weghorst said. “But we’re coming out of the weekend knowing that we learned a lot about our team as a unit and how we play against other teams.”
ARMY 3, HARVARD 2
After trading sets, the Black Knights (6-4) and the Crimson were tied at eight points apiece in the tie-breaking set. But after two unforced errors from Harvard, Army was able to gain enough cushion to push out to a sustainable lead. Nicole Perri recorded the game’s final two kills for the Black Knights to take the fifth and final set and send the Crimson back to Harvard without a victory.
After dealing with injury most of last season, Weghorst has been limited in action this season. The junior didn’t play through the entirety of a game throughout the entire weekend.
“The coach is using every lineup that she can,” Weghorst said. “She’s trying to make sure that she has all of the knowledge to know who will be starting [in Ivy League play].”
AIR FORCE 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard looked poised to take an early lead in the contest after an attack error by Air Force (4-7) put the Crimson up 24-21 with the ball in junior Corie Bain’s hands. But after an uncharacteristic service error forfeited service control for the Crimson, the Falcons won the next four points to win the game and quell any momentum Harvard had possessed.
Bain’s triple-double was not enough to stop the Falcons from taking every set in Friday’s late match just outside the nation’s capital. The Manhattan Beach, Calif., native recorded a team-high 10 kills to go along with 11 digs and 16 assists, but the Falcons’ attack duo of Akokwe Clement and Shelley Spires was too much for the Crimson to handle. The pair averaged a combined nine kills in each set en route to victory.
CALIFORNIA 3, HARVARD 2
The first game of the weekend seemed to be in hand for the Crimson after the second set, with Harvard having taken the first two of the match. Harvard would come back from four points down early in the set to tie the third set at 22 points apiece, but the Bears were able to dig out a third-set win to extend the match.
After grinding out a win in that set, the Bears rolled through the Crimson for the remainder of the game. California took the following sets by scores of 25-18 and 15-9 to complete the three-set comeback and upend Harvard.
Sophomore Paige Kebe was prevalent in the Crimson attack on Friday, recording the most attacks in each contest. In her 41 attack attempts against California, the Ursuline Academy graduate recorded a team-high 14 kills in the match. But she also notched 11 errors to lead the team in that category as well.
“She’s really hitting the ball much better than last year,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “She’s going to improve every year she plays.”
Christine Alftin led the Bears with 15 kills on the night to lead all players while only taking responsibility for three unforced errors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team made waves in the opening weekend to its fall season, placing in the top four in four of its five regattas.
CENTRAL SERIES ONE
The Crimson sent one contingent to compete at Tufts, where it came away with a victory at the Central Series One. Harvard sailed against a number of other NEISA teams in Larks, finishing well ahead of Boston University and Tufts, who took second and third, respectively.
The Crimson dominated both divisions, with the B division duo of freshman skipper Jackson Wagner and junior crew Olivia Kjorlien taking first overall with 41 points. Rookies Nick DiGiovanni and Divya Arya took first in the A division as well, with junior crew Cara Kennedy Cuomo stepping in for the day’s final race.
HARRY ANDERSON TROPHY
One Harvard squad trekked to Yale for the Harry Anderson Trophy, where sailors from all over the east coast competed in 420s. Among the Crimson’s competitors were the Bulldogs, MIT, St. Mary’s of Maryland and the University of South Florida.
No. 10 Harvard ended the weekend in fourth place out of 18 teams, behind the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Boston College, and Boston University. Senior skipper Andrew Mollerus and classmate crew Sydney Karnovsky held down the A division, coming in fifth. In the B division, senior skipper Marek Zaleski and junior crew Julia Lord took third.
HARVARD INVITATIONAL
Another Crimson squad took home bronze on home turf at the Harvard Invitational, competing against local colleges in FJs in fleet-style racing. Gold and silver went to two Bowdoin teams who scored 45 and 46, respectively. The Polar Bears narrowly edged out the Crimson, who ended the day with 47 points.
The A division pair of sophomore skipper Dylan Farrell and junior crew Zoe Kessler earned second place. Meanwhile, freshman skipper Nicholas Karnovsky made his debut in the B division, coming in fourth alongside sophomore Ariana Gross.
PINE TROPHY
In the 73rd Pine Trophy, Harvard took second place, edging out Yale by a single point. The squad of sophomores Nick Sertl and Taylor Ladd and seniors Jacob Bradt and Kristina Jakobson traveled to the home of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where they sailed J-70’s in one division. Over the course of the day’s eight races, the Crimson placed first in three races, and never dipped below fifth place in the pool of eight teams.
TONI DEUTSCH TROPHY
Yet another Harvard group competed down the river at MIT for the Toni Deutsch Trophy, coming in 10th out of 15 teams and sailing in fireflies. The gold again went to Bowdoin, while host MIT came in fourth. In the A division, senior skipper Sophie Bermudez and junior crew Emma Wheeler took sixth. On the other end, the B division duo of freshman skipper Martha Gavula and junior crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj dipped to 11th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The weekend saw different sorts of firsts for members old and new on the Harvard women’s golf squad, which finished fourth in its first tournament of the 2015-2016 campaign.
“I think we were just really pumped to be at our first tournament of the season,” junior Anne Cheng said.
Iowa, the winner of the team competition, was led by the tournament’s individual winner, sophomore Jessica Ip, who had two rounds under par and distanced herself from the field with a second-round 69 en route to a 10-stroke victory.
But Ip was not the only underclassman to finish near the top on the leaderboard.
Despite the Diane Thomason Invitational being Crimson freshman Michelle Xie’s first collegiate tournament and the first time she had played 36 holes in one day for a competition, the Palo Alto, Calif., native kicked off her Harvard career with a plus-6 score, placing her in a tie for second.
“It was really great being able to perform well,” Xie said. “The entire tournament I tried to stay consistent, which I was able to do for the most part.”
Xie started from hole three in the first round, and nerves did not seem to affect her ball striking from the outset. She was under par through her first nine holes of the season and carded a first-round 73.
Again beginning from the third hole in her second round of the day, Xie stumbled slightly at the end of her round, turning in three-consecutive bogeys on holes 34 through 36. However, buoyed by three birdies in the same round, Xie again finished with a 73. While a third-round 76 was her worst of the weekend, the effort was still enough to earn the second-place tie.
Another newcomer to collegiate golf competition was freshman Anna Zhou, who sandwiched a second round 80 with first and third round scores of 77. Also from Palo Alto, Calif., Zhou was near the top of the par-three leaderboard, posting a plus-2 overall mark over the weekend. However, par fours gave Zhou a tougher time, with her 4.43 shot par-four average leaving her in the bottom half of the field.
Elsewhere on the Finkbine Golf Course, which had only one hole with a scoring average under par for the whole tournament, two-time first-team All-Ivy recipient Cheng had more than bunkers and thick rough to deal with. An oversight on her part led to her accidentally signing her first-round scorecard even though one hole did not have a numerical score written down on the physical piece of paper. As a result, Cheng’s first-round score was disqualified.
“It was a careless mistake,” Cheng said. “It was really surprising…[but] I would much rather this happen now than any tournament later [in the year].”
After posting a solid plus-2 following the scorecard mishap, Cheng completed her weekend with a Sunday score of 81, with just one birdie to her name.
Coming in second on the Harvard team for the weekend and tying for 13th overall was sophomore Lito Guo, who overcame a team-worst first-round score of 79 to finish plus-12 for the weekend.
Consistency was key for the Auckland, New Zealand, native in overcoming early struggles. While her front-nine score in round one was under par, six consecutive holes where she recorded a bogey or worse raised her score considerably.
But in round two, Guo kept her mistakes from snowballing, as she only had back-to-back over-par holes once. Three birdies in that same round put her right back into top-20 contention.
The lone senior of the group, captain Christine Lin, started at a blistering pace with birdies in three of her first five holes of the tournament. But the birdies would run dry, and seven bogeys in the final 13 holes dampened her strong start.
Lin would finish her tournament in 20th place, with six total birdies over the three rounds.
As a team, the Crimson was at or near the top of the 12-squad field in individual scoring for all types of holes. Xie’s 4.10 average on par fours was good enough for second among the field. Par threes were Harvard’s strength, as the Crimson posted an average individual hole score of 3.18, which was ahead of tournament winner Iowa.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

One year removed from last place finishes at the same meet last season, the Harvard men’s cross country team tied for second place and the women’s team took home a first-place finish by a one-point margin at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton contest this past Friday at Franklin Park in Boston.
“In the first mile, I just let the race play out, and we stayed together in one big pack,” sophomore Courtney Smith said. “Once we got to the backwoods, three Princeton girls and I had broken away. I wasn’t even sure I was going to race today. It was nice to get back out there after beginning practice only a few weeks ago.”
Smith, who spent most of the offseason nursing an injury, finished as the top runner for Harvard and second overall on the women’s side. Only Princeton’s Elizabeth Bird outran Smith, who finished seven seconds behind the race leader.
The Westchester, Pa., native improved on her performance in the same race from last season, boosting her finish from eighth to second. She also credited her teammates for helping push the team to the top of the podium.
“[Freshman] Kat Gillespie and [sophomore] Marissa Saenger, who were both running in their first college races, both scored for us,” Smith said. “That was huge for us in earning a first place team finish.”
Finishing just one spot and 19 seconds behind Smith was teammate and captain Paige Kouba. With a sixth-place finish, Gillespie joined Smith and Kouba as top-10 Crimson finishers. Sophomore Elianna Shwayder, Saenger, freshman Malia Ellington, and junior Rachel Hampton all scored for the Harvard team, finishing 11th, 14th, 15th, and 16th, respectively.
The team narrowly edged out Princeton for the overall team title, scoring 36 to Princeton’s 37, while Yale finished in third with 50 points on the women’s side.
“Going in, we knew it was an ambitious goal to try to beat Princeton,” Kouba said. “We gave it all we had, and it was enough to win [this meet] for the first time in 19 years. I think that’s a testament to our progress.”
In the men’s race, captain Thomas Purnell claimed first place with a time of 24:48, edging out three Princeton runners who joined the senior in the top four spots. Purnell’s victory led the Crimson to a second place tie with Yale. Tigers junior William Bertrand finished just one second behind Purnell.
“On the men’s side, we emphasized being competitive,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “These were two of the best teams in the Ivy League in Princeton and Yale. In terms of returners from last year’s Heps, they’re the first and third-best teams in the Ivy League. We wanted to mix it up, and that’s exactly what we did.”
Sophomore Ben Huffman was the next Crimson runner across the finish line, 20 seconds after his teammate Purnell, good for seventh place overall and a time of 25:08 in the eight-kilometer race.
Captain Chris Allen finished 11th for Harvard, while junior Brandon Price, freshman Austin Gilbert, and sophomore Louis Colson all earned points for the team, finishing 12th, 16th, and 17th overall, respectively.
The Princeton men’s team ran away with the championship, finishing four runners in the top ten, including three in the top four. The Tigers earned a 16-point victory over Harvard and Yale, which each scored 47 points.
“In terms of mindset, our teams are that much more focused, that much more sharp and hungry [compared to last year],” Saretsky said. “We’re really determined to have an outstanding season, and this is just the first step along that journey. It’s a great way to open up our season against our historic rivals, and I was very pleased with the outcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newest members of the Harvard men’s golf team made a name for themselves in the first contest of the 2015 campaign as freshmen Aurian Capart and Seiya Liu tied captain Rohan Ramnath as the top finishers for the Crimson.
Additionally, Ramnath’s first-round score of 64 matched the Harvard program record for the lowest single-round score.
Opening its fall slate of play this weekend, Harvard traveled to Farmingdale, N.Y., to take part in the Doc Gimmler Invite hosted by St. John’s University at the Bethpage State Park Red Course.
After playing 54 holes over the two-day stretch, the Crimson placed fourth of out nine teams, with a combined score of 846. Ancient Eight rival Yale came out on top as a team, shooting an 825, putting the Bulldogs 15-under par. Johnson and Wales ended in second place, 13 strokes behind the champions.
St. Thomas Aquinas just squeaked out a third-place finish over the Crimson, finishing one shot ahead of Harvard with a score of 845. Fellow Ivy League competitor Columbia placed sixth.
After shooting a 275 in the first round as a team, Harvard positioned itself in second place, only three strokes off the pace set by the Bulldogs. However, the second round was not nearly as kind to the Crimson. The team shot a 291, 11-over par for the course and the third-worst team score for the round. As a result, the team dropped a few spots down the leaderboard.
“The second round comes on the back end of a long day featuring 36 holes of competition,” Ramnath said. “This was our first time playing two rounds in a day this fall, so some of our guys were a bit tired out there, and I think that’s a trend you saw among other teams as well.”
Harvard was able to finish the third round at an even par 280, keeping it at plus-6 overall and locking in its fourth-place finish, 21 strokes behind the Bulldogs.
On the individual side, Ramnath, Capart, and Liu finished in a tie for 13th, shooting a plus-2 over the three-round tournament.
Ramnath fired a first-round score of 64, placing him atop the leaderboard, one shot ahead of Yale junior Li Wang. However, Wang pulled away in later rounds, while Ramnath strugged in the second round relative to the stellar first-round score, shooting at 75. Wang ultimately finished as the individual champion with a 9-under score, three strokes better than fellow Bulldog Jonathan Lai. Yale ended up fielding four of the invite’s top eight individuals for the weekend.
“I think overall there are a lot of good things we can take away from this weekend,” Ramnath said. “We would’ve liked to have played a bit better, but seeing our freshmen perform so well is certainly promising for us moving forward.”
Consistency was key for the two Harvard rookies, with Capart shooting a 70, 71, and a 71 over the three rounds, while his cohort Liu fired a 68, 72, and 72.
“The team has been very supportive of us [freshmen] since day one,” Capart said. “Our coaches and administrators had us ready to go, and we’ve had a lot of help getting adjusted and acclimated to the team. The transition has been extremely smooth.”
Also making up the scoring team for the Crimson were juniors Robert Deng and Kendrick Vinar, finishing tied for 25th and 40th, respectively. Deng started the weekend slowl with scores of 73 and 74, but a final-round 67 helped him jump 14 spots up the leaderboard.
“I’m really excited to be a part of this team; I think it’s the best team we’ve fielded ever,” Ramnath said. “We’re really feeling good about how things are going, and I think at the end of the year if we keep improving we’ll be in a place where we can take on anyone.”
“Our end goal for this season is to win an Ivy Championship,” Capart said. “But we just have to take it one week at a time, get stronger throughout the season, and progress to the level where we can accomplish that goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second weekend of action and its first official contest of the regular season, the Harvard women’s rugby team (1-0) came out on top against perennial national championship contender and two-time semifinalist West Chester (0-1). Playing on the Golden Rams’ home turf, the Crimson scored four tries en route to a 23-17 victory.
Coming off a weekend where the team split games with the University of Prince Edward Island and Bowdoin in a preseason round robin tournament, the team traveled to West Chester in hopes of replicating a win against a familiar opponent. Harvard defeated the Golden Rams, 22-5, a little over a year ago.
According to captain Hope Schwartz, a former Crimson sports editor, the win brought together a lot of what the team has practiced during the preseason.
“Unlike last weekend where there were a few really brilliant individual performances, this weekend we just had the team working really, really hard,” Schwartz said. “[We were] winning our scrums, winning our line outs, and just being really efficient at the point of contact.”
Sophomore Haley Langan put Harvard on the board with her first scores of the season as she tallied two back-to-back tries in the first half to give her side an early lead. West Chester, however, would rally with a pair of tries themselves from junior wing Sophia Schwab.
The game would go back and forth until Harvard scored on a try by junior Claire Collins to take a slim 15-12 lead before the Crimson rallied following a mistake from the Golden Rams.
“Their fly-half missed a kick, and the ball bounced into the try zone, and our wing Mariah was able to get to the ball first for a try,” Schwartz said. “I think that’s a really good example of our team being really aware of what’s happening.”
The error would cost West Chester a try as Harvard would then take a 20-12 lead, but the Golden Rams stayed in the game, finding the end zone in the 77th minute to bring themselves within three.
Despite the rally, the Crimson held off West Chester long enough to earn its first victory of the regular season.
The win was one head coach Sue Parker attributed to a complete team effort, but also to an exceptionally strong performance by the team’s eight forwards.
“It was really the forward unit that set the platform for the team’s victory,” Parker said. “Where we really demoralized West Chester and won the mental aspect of the battle was in the scrum.”
In an especially physical game, Harvard’s forwards managed to win a lot of their scrums and maintain ball control in what proved to be a very close game.
For a young squad with six freshmen and eight sophomores, the win against a seasoned opponent such as West Chester was important for growing in the eyes of Schwartz. Since Harvard’s season is mixed with matches against varsity and club teams, a win against West Chester is significant.
“West Chester is another varsity team and a very good varsity team. For us, this is a very high stakes game for a few reasons,” Schwartz said. “One, because we have a chance to prove our worth against a very formidable varsity opponent, and two, because we got to work on a lot of things going into the start of our Ivy League season.”
Coach Parker echoed the thought as well.
“I think it’s a win we can feel really proud of in terms of our team’s ability to step up and face a national opponent,” Parker said. “I think the team showed a mental toughness today that bodes well for us going into our Ivy conference schedule next week.”
The Crimson returns to Cambridge for its first home match of the season against fellow Ancient Eight competitor Yale on Sept. 19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You can’t win if you don’t score. That was the story of the weekend for the Harvard women’s soccer team (1-4-1) as the squad traveled to Virginia to take on No. 1 Virginia (6-0-1) on Friday night and No. 25 William & Mary (6-1-1) on Sunday afternoon.
While the Crimson defense kept the two offenses in check for most of the two games, the guests were held scoreless in both games, a 3-0 loss to the Cavaliers and a 1-0 defeat at the hands of the Tribe.
“The thing about playing teams the caliber that we’re playing, you can learn something from every team and from every game,” junior co-captain Carly Rotatori said. “These Top 25 teams, even though it’s been a tough schedule, we’ve learned so much as a team.”
WILLIAM & MARY 1, HARVARD 0
Despite outshooting William & Mary, 16-11, with only two of the William & Mary shots coming on net, Harvard suffered a one-goal defeat on Sunday afternoon in Williamsburg, Va. Senior goalkeeper Caroline Casey held the Crimson offense scoreless, stopping all eight Harvard shots she faced.
The Tribe extended its win streak to three, and the team has not lost since falling to Duke on Aug. 30. Senior forward Katie Johnston scored the game’s only goal, giving William & Mary the lead in the 35th minute. It was the fourth goal of the season for Johnston and the team’s 19th on the year.
“William & Mary has been playing really well,” said junior defender and Williamsburg native Marissa Segala. “They just beat [Old Dominion] on Friday.”
While Harvard was able to hinder the potent Tribe offense, it was unable to get on the board for the second consecutive game. The team is averaging 0.5 goals a game and has scored just once in its last four contests. Junior forwards Rachel Garcia and Midge Purce each had two shots on net.
“I think we’ve been very strong defensively,” junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack said. “I don’t think we’ve conceded many easy goals. What we’re trying to focus on ourselves now is scoring a few more goals.”
VIRGINIA 3, HARVARD 0
Virginia showed why it is the top-ranked team in the country on Friday night in Charlottesville. The Cavaliers jumped out to an early lead and kept the pressure on the Crimson all night long, generating opportunities in the offensive zone and minimizing any Harvard scoring chances.
“You want to win, but playing the No. 1 team in the nation, we held our own,” Rotatori said. “I definitely think we could have moved the ball a little better, but we had so much resolve and work ethic in really working together as a team. Maybe 3-0 doesn’t look that good, but I thought as a team we worked really well together.”
Freshman midfielder Betsy Brandon got Virginia on the board with a goal in the game’s seventh minute. Purce registered the Crimson’s first shot on goal in just the third minute, but it ended up being the only save either of Virginia’s two goaltenders would have to make on the night.
Following a corner kick and two shots, junior forward Morgan Reuther cashed in to put the Cavaliers up 2-0 in the 20th minute. It was one of two goals for Reuther, who has a team-high 11 points and five goals.
Durack was replaced in net after halftime by freshman Danielle Etzel. The Cavaliers also pulled starter Jessie Ferrari in favor of junior Morgan Stearns.
Etzel stopped two of the three shots she faced in her first taste of collegiate action. The Crimson did a better job of slowing down the Virginia attack, as the Cavaliers only registered five shots in the second half after an 11-shot barrage in the game’s first 45 minutes. But Reuther picked up her second goal of the night in the game’s final minute when her try from eight yards away was out of the reach of Etzel.
“At halftime, we realized we were getting stretched too comfortably in the midfield,” Rotatori said. “Even though we had good pressure on the ball, they were able to get around us in two or three passes. We switched formations and went into a five in the midfield, and I think that really helped in limiting their shots and their chances.”
Virginia is averaging nearly four goals a game and has outscored its opponents, 26-4, on the season. The last time Harvard faced the nation’s top-ranked team was last November when Harvard fell to UCLA, 7-0, in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Crimson finished the game with five shots, with Purce’s being the only one on goal. Harvard is 0-7-1 against ACC teams—Boston College and now Virginia—during coach Ray Leone’s tenure. The Crimson’s last win against an ACC opponent came in 1997 when Harvard beat Maryland, 3-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Engaging in a battle of the East Coast and the West Coast this weekend, the Harvard men’s water polo team traveled to DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J. to participate in the Princeton Invitational against the Tigers and a trio of California teams.
“I love playing these ranked teams, particularly from California,” junior two-meter defender Dan Stevens said. “Because first, we don’t get the opportunity to play them that much, and second, they bring a level of talent that you don’t see as often on the East Coast. So we were fired up to play them.”
The Crimson (2-4) faced off against Santa Clara (2-3), No. 11 Princeton (4-1), and No. 5 Pacific (8-1). The team also played an exhibition game against Diablo Valley (3-1) on Sunday morning, which it dropped by a score of 21-18.
HARVARD 16, SANTA CLARA 12
Harvard finished the weekend on a high note with a win over Santa Clara—its second victory of the season and its first win in eight games against the Broncos.
Heading into the second quarter with a 4-3 lead, the Crimson watched as co-captain Ben Zepfel took over. Zepfel scored three goals in the frame, helping extend his side’s advantage to three goals at the half.
Harvard’s other co-captain, junior attacker Joey Colton, helped to get the attack going in the first quarter with two scores of his own. Freshman attacker Nick Bunn and senior attacker Blake Lee also recorded goals in the opening frame.
The Broncos retaliated in the second half, but the Crimson never lost control of the lead. Bunn and Lee finished with four goals apiece, and senior attacker Noah Harrison had two goals, three assists, and five steals. Rookie goalie Anthony Ridgley made 11 saves in the win.
PRINCETON 16, HARVARD 12
Saturday evening, Harvard returned to the pool following its matchup with Pacific for the nightcap against the other Tigers from Princeton. The Crimson kept the score much closer in its second game of the day, putting up more of a fight against the more familiar Tigers.
“They’re fighters, so we knew they were going to give us everything they had,” Princeton sophomore attacker Ryan Hammarskjold said.
Harrison led the offense with a hat trick, giving him four goals in addition to five assists on the day. Lee also scored and led the team with a game-high three assists.
The Princeton side was led by senior center Thomas Nelson and freshman driver Michael Swart, who had four goals apiece. Nelson also drew two ejections to help his team maintain a three-two scoring edge.
“I think it was really good for our offense to really just read what was happening in the pool and react to that instead of trying to force plays,” Hammarskjold said.
PACIFIC 21, HARVARD 6
Harvard dropped its first game of the weekend against Pacific. The Crimson got off to a slow start, with Stevens scoring the only goal of the opening quarter. Meanwhile, the Tigers scored a pair of 6-on-5 goals in the first two minutes of the game before tacking on three more by quarter’s end.
Harvard’s offense improved as the game went on as Bunn, Lee, Harrison, and the freshman duo of Grayson Judge and Grant Harvey all found the back of the net. However, the effort was not enough to stop the Tiger offense, led by junior Aleksandar Petrovic’s four goals and senior attacker Krisztian Laczkovic’s hat trick.
“Typically the way we play against some of these really good teams is… we will start off playing very well with them, and then what’s happened is that they kind of run away with it,” Stevens said. “And one of the things that we need to focus on is maintaining that same physicality and mentality at the beginning of the game, throughout the game.”
